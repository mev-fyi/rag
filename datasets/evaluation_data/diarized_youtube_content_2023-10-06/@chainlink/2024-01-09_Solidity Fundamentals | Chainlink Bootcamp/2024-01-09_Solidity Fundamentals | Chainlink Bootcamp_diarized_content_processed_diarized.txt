00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.210 - 00:00:19.360, Speaker B: Hello everyone. I'm so excited. To our second day of the chain link bootcamp. Ten days with you. Ten days to you learn everything related to blockchain, web three and smart contests. And also chain link. The best.
00:00:19.360 - 00:00:54.080, Speaker B: So here we are. We have amazing metrics related to our first day. I did it in English, spanish and portuguese. More than 1000 people live with me in all of these sessions. Also until now, more than 6000 views of all of the sessions. And if you miss the session, you can see and be ready to the next. So we are always help you on this way.
00:00:54.080 - 00:01:21.958, Speaker B: And this is. Let's go. I have some announcements for you. So I will share my screen with these announcements first. By the way, it's a good start to talk about our YouTube channel. So here we are. The solidity fundamentals is here.
00:01:21.958 - 00:01:55.460, Speaker B: We are here on this exactly now. And if you subscribe in the channel, you can see all the sessions. And also we have a lot of interesting series like the future is on. I love this. And videos from Chainlink and the last Smartcom. It was really amazing in Barcelona. So this is a great way to you to start and to be involved in blockchain and the web three as well.
00:01:55.460 - 00:02:32.190, Speaker B: Now let's go to the boot camp. We are on session two. First of all, let's share the presentation with you. So this is the presentation. It's okay. Let's wait a bit here to you to get the presentation. So good.
00:02:32.190 - 00:03:15.828, Speaker B: A few more seconds and okay, let's go to our pet today. This is the pet. I will share this with you. And here we are. So try to add your name, counsel, and don't delete everything, please. Let's see if the patio survived today. Iu add here the YouTube channel and also the presentation.
00:03:15.828 - 00:03:39.460, Speaker B: So I'm getting the presentation now. It's here, getting the link. And I share this link later. Okay, but for now these lights are here. Yes, we are surviving. This is good. Let's try myself.
00:03:43.690 - 00:03:45.110, Speaker A: Hey, I did it.
00:03:45.260 - 00:04:09.694, Speaker B: Amazing. So well today. So good to do. 1 minute more for you. And by the way, you'll be here if you'd like to get the presentation. It's here. Here we are.
00:04:09.694 - 00:04:33.110, Speaker B: A bit more. Hey, TP. Thank you. Love to see you here. Amazing. And don't forget about. Yes, we are part of the chain link boot camp.
00:04:33.110 - 00:05:06.690, Speaker B: So if you'd like to share this in your social media, Twitter, LinkedIn with us, it would be really amazing. Thank you, Javier. Also, let's share our YouTube channel as well. You are here watching with me. So go to our channel. Subscribe to see what's happened. Amazing.
00:05:06.690 - 00:06:02.046, Speaker B: Okay, next step is related to our challenges. So the tasks that we are doing I would add here for you as well. Let's copy it and add it here. I must change this in place. Here we are. And I'm so happy that we really have people from out the world like Kenya, India. Amazing.
00:06:02.046 - 00:06:48.782, Speaker B: Amazing. Italy. So happy. So what about this? This is a Google form and for now we have a few fields over there. First of all, your email use always the same email on this form because I add new questions every day. And if you use the same email, you will get the same form with the responses that you already did and new questions to you to fill day by day. So every day I'm adding new questions and you are adding the new responses.
00:06:48.782 - 00:07:22.298, Speaker B: This is the point. So send email then I'm also asking address to you. Receive your certificate later like a pop. Because we have a wallet for testnet for learn. Maybe you have another wallet with all your collections, all your poaps. So you can use this mainnet wallet to receive your certificate. It's not the same wallet for the course.
00:07:22.384 - 00:07:23.020, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:25.890 - 00:07:46.210, Speaker B: Yes, it's coxy. Amazing question. Yes, I'm thinking about a wallet address. So I fix this latest. But even if you don't this now and okay, you put like your email address. You can update later. This is not a problem.
00:07:46.210 - 00:08:01.320, Speaker B: Now the farm you be open at least the end of the curse and a bit more. So let's see how is the peg now? Survived? No.
00:08:01.630 - 00:08:02.442, Speaker A: Oh yes.
00:08:02.496 - 00:08:32.062, Speaker B: Survived. And yes, people from Nigeria, Czech Republic, Italy, India, Malaysia, Pakistan. Really, really amazing how the words perfect really, really love this. So let's go forward. Today we are talking about smart context. We are creating our first smart context. This is our goal.
00:08:32.062 - 00:08:56.934, Speaker B: Today I have a few slides. I know that I must talk more with you about Webicree, about some concepts. We can talk about philosophy as well. But today my goal is to do a really hands on section. So here we are. Let's talk about smart context a bit. Okay.
00:08:56.934 - 00:09:29.470, Speaker B: I shared the QR code a bit more because the people are asking this two care codes for today. First, chain link bootcamp tasks and IU fix this a bit. And second, the presentation.
00:09:32.450 - 00:09:33.200, Speaker A: Okay.
00:09:36.510 - 00:09:53.006, Speaker B: And let's go forward. Here we are. Let's talk about smart context. I love smart context. This is my word. So what are smart contracts? First of all, they are not smart. They are not content.
00:09:53.006 - 00:10:48.802, Speaker B: Not in the concept of this. Why it is not a concept? Because we think about a content in a way that an agreement we can use as much content to create or to simulate or to use in a way that we use content. But as much content is more than this. Because this is a computer program, they are not smart because they will do exactly what you define to do. So they are not changing and learning by themselves. So what are smart contexts? Smart contexts are computer programs, like I said before, that are published and executed in a blockchain elements. This happens in an autonomous way.
00:10:48.802 - 00:11:09.994, Speaker B: But be careful because we must call the ismatch content, call a function in the smart content, trigger this, and then what is defined inside will be executed like this. Much content cannot discover something outside if you don't call the smart context. This is important.
00:11:10.112 - 00:11:10.780, Speaker A: Okay.
00:11:11.310 - 00:11:51.078, Speaker B: And what is really important when we talk about smart context and the blockchain? That we have no intermediaries on this. So it means that there are a computer problem that is executing the rules that was defined and nobody in the middle will change this. This is the point. And we are going to the last point that is immutable. Why this is immutable because it's published in a blockchain and the blockchain, it's immutable. This is the point.
00:11:51.244 - 00:11:51.960, Speaker A: Okay.
00:11:55.210 - 00:12:26.994, Speaker B: One question more related to the farm. The farm will be opened until the end of this boot camp. So don't worry. You don't must feel today. You can feel today, tomorrow. In fact, you are feeling this almost every day because every day I'm adding new questions and you must come back to your me that you fill it with your email. The email is the key for this.
00:12:26.994 - 00:13:27.250, Speaker B: And then you fill the new questions as well. Thank you, Brett for helping me. What is really important for me related to Ismad's content is this, because I think we have huge challenges related to trust in the society today. It's hard because we have big companies and a lot of time. You must trust on brains, trust on companies and the things in the company can change and the rules can change. And this is hard. How can we trust on something that we can be sure that this will not change? And this is what we are expecting.
00:13:27.250 - 00:14:05.466, Speaker B: I think this is daysmart context. So these much contents will solve these society critical trust issues. Because we don't have the counterpart risk. We are not based on paper guarantees or brands. We are based on messy, on cryptography. We are talking about the cryptograph group. And in this way we know that we work with blockchain and transparent blockchains, public blockchains.
00:14:05.466 - 00:14:46.960, Speaker B: So our disparate. It's immutable the rule you're not changing the needle without the approval and without be public. And we have more success and more trust on this kind of environment. I can say that this is more secure to us, it's really important and okay, you can see that. Thinking about what I must present to you is this. I don't have more presentations. Let's go to the hands on part now.
00:14:46.960 - 00:15:20.940, Speaker B: So what we are doing, it seems that our pet survived today, so I can use it. Be careful with the automatic translation because annoying us a lot. So let's try here to use our tool. Today we are using remix. Not only today, all the other days. Let's go to remix. And it's better if you go to the HPS remix and I'm not.
00:15:20.940 - 00:15:32.142, Speaker B: So let's change mine and go here with you here.
00:15:32.196 - 00:15:32.800, Speaker A: Yes.
00:15:34.850 - 00:15:54.740, Speaker B: So I have some quotes for you. Don't worry about what is your. Okay, I found a good notice. You create a workspace. Don't worry about your workspace. I'm creating one here only because I need to have it.
00:15:59.910 - 00:16:00.980, Speaker A: Here. Yes.
00:16:02.310 - 00:16:53.222, Speaker B: So I only mix like you. So what's remix? Remix, it's an environment to you to develop smart context. And it's totally online. You don't need to install nothing or computer if you are a developer. Remix is not so easy to create complex projects because you have less automation here. So if you have a new environment in your computer, like hat, hat or others, using node Js and using other points, probably for the devastate developers, you'll be better. But remember that this is a base course for everyone, a basic course.
00:16:53.222 - 00:17:30.494, Speaker B: And after this, in the last session I will follow you, I will share with you some paths to you to go forward. Okay, so here we are on remix. We have enough in here. Let's understand a bit more related to remix what I have here. The first icon here is the file Explorer. Here we are creating our files, our smart context. Then I used to use the four icon here solidage compiler.
00:17:30.494 - 00:18:02.874, Speaker B: So here we are doing some configuration. Go to the icon four and I'm counting this being the first 1234 and enable the auto compile. This will be better for you. Easy to compile your smart contract in an automatically way and discover the horse faster.
00:18:03.002 - 00:18:03.680, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:06.050 - 00:18:23.266, Speaker B: Don'T worry about the boot camp workspace here. Probably you are in the default workspace, it's good for you. But because you can see that my default workspace has a lot of things, I create a new one. But you don't need to do this.
00:18:23.368 - 00:18:24.020, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:26.490 - 00:19:22.470, Speaker B: Where is mine? Here okay, I only like to have a clean space to work with you. Next point, icon five. Deploy and driven transactions here is the most important for you because here we are connecting the remix with our wallet. Remember metamask from yesterday? This is the point. So what I must do here I go to the environment and change to injected provider metamask. Let's see. Here we are environment injected provider metamask.
00:19:22.470 - 00:19:51.680, Speaker B: This is our environment. So in this point, like the faucet yesterday, metamask open a pop up window and I must authorize this, I must authorize that remix, can connect and can interact with my wallet. So I'm doing this now. Next and connect.
00:19:54.910 - 00:19:56.060, Speaker A: Here we are.
00:19:57.570 - 00:20:54.006, Speaker B: Great. This is good. Next you can see. Oh, by the way, you can see here now that I have the sepolia and the ID, the chain ID of the Sepalia network here. And why is Sepalia here? I have sepolia here because on my wallet I have sepolia here as well. And by the way, I change my wallet because yesterday I created three wallets. I create a wallet in each of the sessions I'd like to use all the wallets that I have, that it will be a better wallet for me.
00:20:54.006 - 00:21:28.334, Speaker B: So probably I will change the wallet in the middle. Okay, so is this remix reviewing? First icon four enable out compile. Then icon five environment go to ingested provider. So my remix is done, prepared to connect with my wallet and then it's connected with the blockchain. Let's go now to the icon two file Explorer to create our first smart.
00:21:28.382 - 00:21:29.170, Speaker A: Context.
00:21:31.910 - 00:22:13.018, Speaker B: Icon to create the haster saw. How can I do this remix? Here below the workspace I have the create new file button. So it's here. Create new file and hash step. Let's do a joke now. But it's not all a joke. Some people ask me, oh, my name is Peter.
00:22:13.018 - 00:22:58.590, Speaker B: Can I create the hashister pong to Peter or the hashtag Peter thehesister Bob? No, the solidity saw is not from myself, it's not from Solenji, it's from solidity. So all the smart contexts have the extension sol. So haster solved. This is the naming of our file and it's open some parts here. Don't worry about it. Has albert is asking about other alternatives. Yes, we have some alternatives to install in our computer.
00:22:58.590 - 00:23:03.690, Speaker B: I will talk about using the last day today only beginners.
00:23:03.770 - 00:23:04.400, Speaker A: Okay.
00:23:05.890 - 00:23:42.634, Speaker B: And I will go one more time to connect with my wallet. Okay, so how to connect with my wallet? Go to icon 1235. Deploy engine transactions environment here it used to be here on remix VM and then you are connecting to the injected provider, let's do again. Yes, now I can injected provider.
00:23:42.762 - 00:23:45.600, Speaker A: Okay, is this.
00:23:50.050 - 00:24:48.642, Speaker B: And really if I'm fast, if you need some help like Vandena, let me know because this is for you. So if I'm fast I must slow down and do this in a way that is good for you. I plan it two hour sessions exactly to do this in a peaceful way. Okay, so injected provider, here we are. Let's come back to the icon two file explorer here I have my content empty yet and let's understand a bit more related to this. First of all we are using comments. This is a comment, you don't need to copy the comment now so I may put in a solid comment that is the beginning and another, that's the end.
00:24:48.642 - 00:25:10.700, Speaker B: So you add this much content between the beginning and the end. So copy between beginning and end. Please don't cut the code copy because if you cut the other person in the live you cannot do it.
00:25:12.030 - 00:25:12.780, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:14.830 - 00:25:39.626, Speaker B: Here I add this much content for me and for you. Let's go. I have it in another window. Wait, let's see what is the last 22. Okay, I'd like to go to 21. So here we are. This is my ismat concept.
00:25:39.626 - 00:26:06.794, Speaker B: You must trust on me now because I'm pasting this and you are doing the same. Let's edit this for you. Remember copy what is between the beginning and the ending. Here we are. I'm explaining this part for you now.
00:26:06.912 - 00:26:07.580, Speaker A: Okay.
00:26:14.770 - 00:27:34.520, Speaker B: What I have here, remember that I told you that these two slashes for the right, they are comments, okay? But in this case I copied this because it's a good practice to add in the first line of your concept the kind of license that you are using. So I'm using an open source license, the MIT license and this is, I define the license here. After this I have the comment pragma. This is the comment to define the version of the solidish compiler that I'm using. And we have new versions almost every month they are upgrading and be better. This is really amazing. And if you compare the new versions with old versions we have, including that the OD versions has some bugs or some limitations related to overflow of numbers, for example that now the compiler take care of this for you, okay.
00:27:34.520 - 00:27:47.574, Speaker B: And yes Liam, please copy here, copy this part and paste here on remix.
00:27:47.702 - 00:27:48.380, Speaker A: Okay.
00:27:50.350 - 00:28:16.810, Speaker B: And ianaki as you can use Coinbase wallet any wallet that you have installed injected in your browser. Be careful to not use a wallet that you have mainnet funds to not take any risks when you are learning. Okay, use a new wallet only for the curse, only for testnet.
00:28:16.910 - 00:28:17.560, Speaker A: Okay.
00:28:23.160 - 00:28:49.960, Speaker B: Is this. So talk a bit more. Remember comment pragma to define the version of the language. Solidity the language. And I'm using the 0.8.21. And remember that this is the beginner's course. Curse.
00:28:49.960 - 00:29:33.204, Speaker B: We are starting from zero, creating our first smart contract today. Tomorrow we are creating an ERC 20 token and talking about chaining. And day by day we are learning new concepts and advanced talks. Until next to write this. Okay, the comment content is the command user to define your content. So what I have here between these breaks, it's my content. So the name of my content is haster, like the name of my file can be different, but it's a good practice to have the same.
00:29:33.342 - 00:29:34.030, Speaker A: Okay.
00:29:41.200 - 00:30:16.250, Speaker B: And here we are, what I have in this contract, first of all, I have a variable. The type is a string. It means that I can add any kind of information inside this. Imagine that a variable is like a box that you can add some stuff inside. I can add any kind of stuff in. Nice string variable. If it was an integer, for example, I only can add numbers.
00:30:16.250 - 00:30:27.468, Speaker B: If it is a uint, I can add only numbers, positive numbers. So a string, you can add everything inside.
00:30:27.634 - 00:30:28.350, Speaker A: Okay.
00:30:30.400 - 00:31:02.244, Speaker B: And this is my variable is defined to be private. It means that I can access this variable only inside theismatch content, but it's private, but not so much because when you are saving some information in this variable, the transaction is public. So it's possible to discover what you are saving on this variable.
00:31:02.372 - 00:31:03.050, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:03.740 - 00:31:43.444, Speaker B: And the name of my variable is info. Let's come back. I'm missing a lot of questions in the chat. Interesting question. So, yes, Vandena, we have our wallet connected with the sepolia testnet. So first of all, in metamask, I choose sepolia. So here I am in the sepolia network, and because I connect remix with Metamask, and Metamask is in Sepolia, remix is showing Sepolia as well.
00:31:43.562 - 00:31:44.230, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:45.000 - 00:32:44.464, Speaker B: And to review this, the first line, it's not an obligation, but it's a recommendation from solidity to have the kind of license that you are using. In the first line, in my case, it's MIT and this is an open search license. Okay, let's go forward. On my contact, inside my contact, I defined two functions. What's a function? A function, it's like a name that when I call this naming, all the comments that are inside the function will be executed. In this case I only have like one comment, but I can have others like tomorrow. We are seeing some functions with a lot of comments.
00:32:44.464 - 00:33:47.540, Speaker B: Today it's only one. I have a function call it get info and this is the name of my function. I may define that this is publicly, anyone can call this function, including inside from another ismatch content. Inside the ismatch content or outside it's a view because I don't have nothing on this content that is changing the state of the blockchain. So I'm not saving new information on blockchain, only getting the information that is stored in my variable and presenting this because of this. This is a view, the view don't change nothing, only state. Okay, and so the return of this function, it's a string like the same type of my variable.
00:33:47.540 - 00:34:34.580, Speaker B: We say that this is memory because it's not saved on blockchain as well. And this will be presented to you. And here we are. When I call this, you beherned the content of the variable info. And next function that I have, this is the set info. The set info is to save some information to store something inside my variable colored info. So because of this I must pass a parameter to my function.
00:34:34.580 - 00:35:20.436, Speaker B: Here we are. It's a string, it must be the same type as well it's memory because it will be used only in the moment that the function is colored. And then it's the underscore input the name of my parameter. If public, it's public as well. Anyone can call this inside the contract or outside like you and I, saving storing the information from the underscore info inside my variable info. This is interesting. Don't worry about the infinite gas message.
00:35:20.436 - 00:35:56.192, Speaker B: This is because I turned this off. This is because if you pass near some information here, it will calculate for you how much gas you cost to you to call that function. And because when we have this stringy, we don't know how much this costs because depends of the size of your string, how many characters do you have. So because of this you have the infinite guess. Don't worry about it.
00:35:56.246 - 00:35:56.850, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:00.180 - 00:36:47.408, Speaker B: So good, this is our is much content. It's done. Let's see if you have some here. Okay, so Mohammed that joined, now go to the pad and follow the pad. In a few minutes you can be with us. Here we are, the contact is done. And now can you see a green sign near the solidit compiler? And if you pass the mouse over there, can you see this message compilation successful? This is important to you?
00:36:47.494 - 00:36:48.130, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:52.280 - 00:37:12.504, Speaker B: And I have this because I selected. I enabled the autocompile before. If you didn't do the autocompile, you must compile the content. And only after this you are seeing this green message.
00:37:12.622 - 00:37:13.290, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:15.500 - 00:37:55.610, Speaker B: Great. Now I make sure that my content is compiled and you go to the deploy and run transactions again. So now we are going to the icon five. So let's do two points. Icon four and yes, someone put it again here. I don't need it. Icon four, you have the compilation, and then let's go to icon five again.
00:37:55.610 - 00:39:01.288, Speaker B: And it's time to deploy. In this moment, when I deployed my contract, I may clicking on deploy now. In this moment I may remix, prepare a transaction with my contract and send this transaction to metamask. So, metamask receive this transaction. To deploy my concrete, I must authorize this on metamask. When I confirm this metamask is sending my transaction to the network, we call that it is broadcasting the transaction to the network using the metamask node. Then my transaction will be in the main pool of the network, waiting to be added in a block.
00:39:01.288 - 00:39:34.900, Speaker B: And the next validator, or some validator, you add my transaction in the block. So, are you ready to confirm it? Let's deploy our first smart context. Confirm. Here we are. If I go here on metamask, it's pending in a few minutes. You can see that this will be confirmed. When this is confirmed, you can find your contact here in the left side down deploy it contacts.
00:39:34.900 - 00:40:33.490, Speaker B: So go to deployed contacts, copy the register address and paste it here. Let's add your naming and the register address. Let's get Mini. So here, left side down, deployed contacts in the right side of register. Here. You can copy and then paste here. So if you have some problems with faucet like grunt, we are on Sepolia.
00:40:33.490 - 00:41:00.000, Speaker B: It doesn't matter. The network pricing now, guys. And like groomed, you can do it. Now this is not a problem. Check the farm, because I put two faucets over there. Or check our session yesterday to get some faucets. Perfect, Lucas.
00:41:00.000 - 00:41:32.850, Speaker B: Thank you. Yes, Lucas, could you add this in the. Thank you. And this is amazing. We have a lot of people that create your first as much content now. I don't need it now. Let's take off.
00:41:32.850 - 00:42:00.996, Speaker B: Wow, so amazing. A lot of people creating our first smart contract now. So if it's deployed sometime. As you can see, the pop up from Metamask, this is not a problem. If you'd like to see your transaction, you can go to Metamask. The transaction is here. Go to the block explorer.
00:42:00.996 - 00:42:10.110, Speaker B: And this is my transaction. And you can see that I created discomfort discounted was created here.
00:42:10.480 - 00:42:11.230, Speaker A: Okay.
00:42:15.120 - 00:42:23.730, Speaker B: Great guys, we create our smart contract. Now let's interact with him with it.
00:42:24.820 - 00:42:25.952, Speaker A: Here we are.
00:42:26.086 - 00:42:54.516, Speaker B: Scroll down. So I open it, I expand this part and you can see here the two buttons that there are the two functions that I have. Why one is blue and the other is orangey. The blue button means that I'm not changing nothing. The blockchain. It's only a query. This is not being broadcast throughout the network.
00:42:54.516 - 00:43:21.040, Speaker B: This information came from the wallet that you are connected. So the information get info came from Metamask. The metamask note, click on get info. Probably you have not nothing. So to understand what you are doing here now. Amazing. I love this is my content creating.
00:43:21.040 - 00:44:02.080, Speaker B: Now let's go to set info. Add your information here. So I'd like to put the chain link bootcamp. So I write some information here. And now I'm clicking on set info. What am I doing now? I'm sending another transaction to the blockchain. Because I'm changing the blockchain state.
00:44:02.080 - 00:44:31.962, Speaker B: I'm changing the network state. So remix, create the transaction, send the transaction to my wallet to Metamask. When I authorize this on Metamask, then this transaction will be broadcasted to the network and some validator. A validator. You get it? Here we are confid probably now.
00:44:32.016 - 00:44:32.620, Speaker A: Yes.
00:44:56.400 - 00:45:37.224, Speaker B: And this is. And also let's show this part for you. In the right part of remix down, we have a window on this window. On this window we have some people, some things here, all the information related to what you are doing. So we can see a transaction related to the creation of this much content. And now the green sign is a transaction that we call it the set info. I used to have this like this.
00:45:37.224 - 00:46:17.712, Speaker B: Now to monitor if I come back to get info after my transaction is confirmed. So now I have the chain link bootcamp. This is an interesting question. Yes, I need to pay gas to interact with myismatch content when I'm paying gas, when I'm transferring cryptocurrencies, when I'm creating as much content, or when I am interacting with as much content. Like changing something that is much content. This is the case now. I didn't paid gas when I use the get info.
00:46:17.712 - 00:46:37.870, Speaker B: Why? Because I'm not changing nothing on blockchain. It's only a query. But the set info. Yes, it's changing the state. So we are paying gas for this. And yes. Guys, what about you? Do this.
00:46:37.870 - 00:47:17.624, Speaker B: Let's share on Twitter or another network. I created my first match content in the chain link boot camp 2024. Amazing. It so is this. This was our first contact. I'm really proud of you. Related what happened with the gas that we are paying? Let's respond like Liam question in another way.
00:47:17.822 - 00:47:18.776, Speaker A: Here we are.
00:47:18.878 - 00:47:54.900, Speaker B: This is my transaction. You can see here that this was the transaction fee. So we pay this and this was the gas price. This went to the validator of my transaction. And this is testnet. Let's go to the iteration on mainnet to understand a bit more related to this. A part of the gas will be burned and another part go to the validator.
00:47:54.900 - 00:48:35.760, Speaker B: So here we are. Let's get like a block. This block, for example, you can see here that a part of the. And this is my, wait, better for you, a part of the fish was burned and this was the base ship by gas. So this blockade used G's on gas and a part was burned. Another part was being rewarded to the validator.
00:48:38.260 - 00:48:39.330, Speaker A: Is this.
00:48:41.940 - 00:49:08.488, Speaker B: So this is really amazing. This is the basic for you to create your first match content. Now we are in a network, doesn't matter where you are in the world, we can interact with the content for the other. Ah, I like it. Before that, Gabriel, I like your idea. Let's see this. I used to do this.
00:49:08.488 - 00:49:52.120, Speaker B: Thank you for remembering me. Reminded me. Here we are, this is my transaction. If I scroll down, go to click to show more. You can see here the function set info. And remember that I told you that my variable info is private, but not so much because when I'm sending some information, this is public. So if I change here to see the input in UTF eight, you can see the chain link boot camp here, or I prefer to do the decode input data.
00:49:52.120 - 00:50:25.108, Speaker B: Here we are. We have the parameter underscore info, it's a string. And I added this information over there. Okay, and let's come back here. Now a question for you. Do you think that can I change my information now? Because I told you that blockchain is immovable. But what about my information? This is the point.
00:50:25.108 - 00:51:19.750, Speaker B: What can I change? What cannot updating on this moment, the code of my content, the search code of the smart contract. I cannot change anymore. This will be forever on the blockchain. Okay, so this code, if I like to change the name of the info and publish again, it will not be the same as much content with Matt contact. I can't change the first code, okay, but I can update the information because I create a contract with a function that it make me able to do this. This is the set info. If I don't have the set info, no, I can't change my information.
00:51:19.750 - 00:51:30.410, Speaker B: Okay, so let's add that this is chain minky boot camp 2024 by so and let's change.
00:51:43.250 - 00:51:43.998, Speaker A: It.
00:51:44.164 - 00:52:08.534, Speaker B: Here we are. So I did a new transaction to update the information. If I go to get info now, the information changed it. And remember that this was the old information. This is my concrete and someone else changed my information. Let's see what happened. I love this.
00:52:08.534 - 00:52:32.890, Speaker B: We are on blockchain. This is perfect. I created the content here and this is all the transactions, all the interactions with my content. You know that this was my first. Let's see this transaction if it's mine or not. So I don't know if it's mine. Yes.
00:52:32.890 - 00:53:02.826, Speaker B: Oh, thank you so much. Someone came into my smart contest and say thank you for me. You are welcome. I'm so happy to be here. And probably so this is my transaction that I updated to the chain link bootcamp by. So this is interesting. Do you think about it? I have all the history of the changes inside my smart context.
00:53:02.826 - 00:53:22.300, Speaker B: Every time that the setting was called, we have a transaction of this. So you can have some kind of audit of this if you like it. And I saw an interesting messaging here that I must answer. Wait.
00:53:24.450 - 00:53:25.200, Speaker A: Here.
00:53:27.090 - 00:54:06.650, Speaker B: This gas limit is the limit that the gas limit is set up by. We must understand more about gas itself. I didn't prepare this question, but let's talk a bit more. First of all, we have the gas limit of a transaction and we have the gas limit for a block. Let's get the block to understand the gas limit of a block. It's the amount of gas that. This is the amount of gas that can fit in a block.
00:54:06.650 - 00:54:43.750, Speaker B: And you can see here that it was out of the block. He was filled. Let's get really old block. I can get the number of the block here. So old block. You can see on this block that in the past, the gas limit was this because of sepolia? I'd like to show you something different related to you. The gas limit was increased by the timing in Ethereum.
00:54:43.750 - 00:55:20.786, Speaker B: And this is related to the size of the block. If the block is too big, you need more time to synchronize the blocking the network. So this is a challenger to find a size of block that is easy to broadcast and synchronize on the network. But in the same time, it's not so huge. But not so is Mao, this is the point. I came to the main net. Now let's see how is the block size.
00:55:20.786 - 00:55:53.760, Speaker B: It's 30 million. But how was this like in the block number 1000 in July of 2015. Look at the gas limited. It was only 500. And this was increased year by year. Let's go to the 10,000 to see if it is the same. Like it's still 15.
00:55:53.760 - 00:56:19.670, Speaker B: Let's put one more zero here. In some moment, you can see this. Oh, here we are. In August of 2015, you can see that the gas limit was increased. And they was increased like in different points. This used to be increased in some updates of the EVM. Okay, so you understand a bit more.
00:56:19.670 - 00:56:27.878, Speaker B: This is the gas limit of the block. I may also have the gas limit of my transaction. Let's talk about this in another moment.
00:56:27.964 - 00:56:28.600, Speaker A: Okay.
00:56:31.210 - 00:57:06.078, Speaker B: And come back here. My goal now, so I may creating the smart context register. I did the set info and then I changed my information later. My goal now is change your smart content. Let's get as much content from another person. So what you are doing now are you teach you how to get a smart content that is already deployed by another person and interact with this content. How can I do this? Let's go to the pets.
00:57:06.078 - 00:57:36.400, Speaker B: And yes, my pet sometimes has problem, but this is normal. And here it's wallet. Okay, let's get Brent. Brent, I get your conflict. Now let's see what's happened with your contract. I copied the address of Brent concert. And now I add this in the add address field.
00:57:36.400 - 00:58:14.230, Speaker B: So to interact with other concept address in at address. So let's go. I have the brand content. Let's see if it is a contact itself. And now you can see that I have two instance of hedges. The first is mine. The second is from brand.
00:58:14.230 - 00:58:45.380, Speaker B: Let's see what information he added over there. Chain link bootcamp 2024. Amazing. Brent, you change this to so was here and okay. Confirming the transaction in the network. It's confirmed. So if I go to the get info now.
00:58:45.380 - 00:59:31.430, Speaker B: I changed Brent content. Brent, could you share with the chat if your quantity was changed for you as well? I will get one more. Let's get another person who is here, who would like to change the content. Okay. Vandena interact a lot of me. Let's see Vandena as well. So doing again, I copied the address of Vandena contact, then came to ET address not deploy at the address paste click on at address.
00:59:31.430 - 01:00:12.628, Speaker B: And now I have three instance of heister mini branch. Vandena. Let's open her. Get info chain link. Bootcamp boot camp. I'm using another information confirming this and then get info. I updated Vandana content.
01:00:12.628 - 01:00:33.484, Speaker B: Vandana. The same. Could you check if your content was updated and adding the chat if he was, please. And h. Your button is grayed because you don't paste the address here. If I don't have your address, I cannot click on this. It's the same here.
01:00:33.484 - 01:00:57.704, Speaker B: If I don't have like in the set info. If I don't have the information, I cannot click on set info. So, Bret, let's hide this. And Bret, go to your content and click on get info. Another person. Change your content. Okay, Bret.
01:00:57.704 - 01:01:20.492, Speaker B: Now Jane was here. Perfect. So interesting. So is this. We are in a network. We are around the world. And we are interacting with other contents that are already published on the network.
01:01:20.636 - 01:01:21.330, Speaker A: Okay.
01:01:23.940 - 01:01:35.828, Speaker B: If you. Wait. Check if you put some space at the end. At the beginning. Something's wrong with your address. This is not a recognized address.
01:01:35.914 - 01:01:36.550, Speaker A: Okay.
01:01:40.540 - 01:01:59.790, Speaker B: Vandana told me that she refreshed the screen. Yes, Vandana. If I refresh my screen now. Are you lost this. So what you must do the etsy address part. You must have the register content. Open it in your screen.
01:01:59.790 - 01:02:08.144, Speaker B: Paste the address of your content here, click on IP address and then you have your content again.
01:02:08.262 - 01:02:08.930, Speaker A: Okay.
01:02:10.980 - 01:02:16.684, Speaker B: We have two breads. So I don't know which bread. I change the content bread maybe is the other.
01:02:16.742 - 01:02:17.350, Speaker A: Okay.
01:02:20.920 - 01:03:08.580, Speaker B: So with this now, next step, let's verify our smart content on Teresa. This is an important point for you as well. What am I doing now? Here is the ateriscrum. Go to Atteriskum and check your concrete. Let's go down to that terrace. Come search your contract address. Go to the Tabi contract.
01:03:08.580 - 01:03:23.064, Speaker B: We are doing this now.
01:03:23.102 - 01:03:23.690, Speaker A: Okay.
01:03:25.020 - 01:04:01.190, Speaker B: Go to tabi contract and let's see the process. Here we are. I am in the tabi contract now and I'm clicking on verify and publish contact. What I must do here. This is my address. Let's select the compiler. This is a solid single file and the version was 80 21.
01:04:01.190 - 01:04:47.760, Speaker B: Okay. And you must check the kind of license that you are using as well. So I will maintain this a bit here to you. Solid single file. Compile version eight. MIT licensed. Okay, let's go forward.
01:04:47.760 - 01:05:22.676, Speaker B: Continue. Now you can see that I can add the search code of my content here. So I come back to remix, copy the code, come back to the ether scan paste. I don't have any constructor arguments. Don't worry about this now. This is our first contact. It's only this don't worry about the other fields now.
01:05:22.718 - 01:05:23.310, Speaker A: Okay.
01:05:27.270 - 01:05:45.520, Speaker B: And then I'm not a robot, are you dujess? So let's find some bicycles. Motorcycles.
01:05:49.510 - 01:05:50.260, Speaker A: Yes.
01:05:50.710 - 01:06:09.542, Speaker B: It's so hard to prove that I'm not a robot. Okay, so with this now I can verify. I will do it again if you need it. So let's come back a bit where we was here.
01:06:09.596 - 01:06:10.200, Speaker A: Yes.
01:06:12.750 - 01:06:22.590, Speaker B: I ask you to go to the iteration we started here. Let me come back to zero.
01:06:22.660 - 01:06:23.230, Speaker A: Okay.
01:06:23.380 - 01:06:54.742, Speaker B: From zero. And I did something wrong. Here we are. Interscom search my register address. Find it, then go to tabi contract. And in fact, I didn't finish the process. But because my contact is like others, our first are doing this in the same time.
01:06:54.742 - 01:07:04.170, Speaker B: And I use this content like for five years. I love this content. And then my content is already verified.
01:07:04.510 - 01:07:05.260, Speaker A: Okay.
01:07:07.390 - 01:07:48.030, Speaker B: And this is so cool because I can interact with my content here on that iterate canal. When you have this green sign on your content. If I go to read content, I can see the getting here, click on it and achieve was here on my content. Welcome, AK. I can go to write concrete in the same way that I did with remix. I can connect the ether scan with my wallet. Okay, connecting.
01:07:48.030 - 01:08:08.040, Speaker B: I'm connected now. Let's do this bigger for you. I'm connected now. And if I go to setting so again. And I'm changing the information again.
01:08:13.610 - 01:08:14.166, Speaker A: It.
01:08:14.268 - 01:08:32.960, Speaker B: I can see my transaction. Let's sing another tap. In a few minutes you have this done. And this is so cool, because I can interact in both places now if I come back to remix, my contact will change. So again.
01:08:35.490 - 01:08:36.480, Speaker A: Is this.
01:08:38.290 - 01:09:12.022, Speaker B: Perfect? Lucas, I read answered here, but you highlight this. Exactly. If you don't have. Why am I doing here? I was saying if you don't have the concert tabby, probably this is not a concept. For example, let's get my address wallet. And let's find my address wallet. This is account wallet, not a contact wallet.
01:09:12.022 - 01:09:23.030, Speaker B: So you cannot see the contact tab here. So be sure that you have the hashtag address here and then you have the contact.
01:09:23.120 - 01:09:23.760, Speaker A: Okay.
01:09:32.080 - 01:09:56.660, Speaker B: So it's good. And this is so fun because we know that this is my content and a lot of people are interacting with this. Amazing. Thank you. This is something that I really love when I'm doing something online is to have you interacting with me. Like publishing address, interact with the content. This is really amazing.
01:09:56.660 - 01:09:57.910, Speaker B: I love this.
01:10:00.680 - 01:10:01.430, Speaker A: Okay.
01:10:04.220 - 01:10:28.028, Speaker B: I know. Vandana, what happened with you? Okay, probably you have the right content. But when you told us that you refresh remix, probably you didn't connect your remix with the metamask again. So go to environment and connect with the injected provider. Probably this.
01:10:28.114 - 01:10:28.750, Speaker A: Okay?
01:10:29.300 - 01:11:03.290, Speaker B: And I like to show some problems and to solve live, because in this way maybe you can have this problem tomorrow. And now you can learn as well. Okay, so this was our first contact. We learned how to verify also here on iteriscom. And now we are doing another content. It's time to do another contact. Why? Let's think about our content.
01:11:03.290 - 01:11:44.328, Speaker B: Any person can interact with your contract. Do you think that is good? Think about security. Any person can write something wrong in your contract. So I know we saw a lot of hackers in the past because of wrong permissions inside smart context. It's so important to take care about the permissions of the functions. For now, this is only the dachki. This is for you exactly to learn.
01:11:44.328 - 01:11:57.592, Speaker B: But if I doing. If I'm developing something complex and a real project, I must be careful with the permissions of how they functions.
01:11:57.736 - 01:11:58.430, Speaker A: Okay.
01:12:01.440 - 01:12:48.532, Speaker B: So it's time to do another version of register. And in this new version we are having something different. First point, we will have like some permissions, a list. Hello, list to do this. So let's create now go to the icon, two registeraccess. So same is beginning. Wait a bit, because I have this, but it's old version.
01:12:48.532 - 01:13:22.310, Speaker B: I will predated this for you. Where is my register access? Um, I know, I'd like to get the boot camp register access. I'm getting a new version of this for you. Where is this? Where is this? Not yet.
01:13:25.500 - 01:13:26.552, Speaker A: Here we are.
01:13:26.686 - 01:14:03.860, Speaker B: This is the bootcamp that I'd like to use. And let's get it. I will first paste for me myself, because I didn't click the conflict to see if I may write. And then you do in the wrong place. Register access. Then let's see if my contact is right. I'd like to be in the same version.
01:14:03.860 - 01:14:16.216, Speaker B: Yeah, it seems to be good. And you are learning a lot. Now this is a bit complex. Solidity function.
01:14:16.318 - 01:14:18.330, Speaker A: Okay, perfect.
01:14:19.820 - 01:14:42.172, Speaker B: Let's copy and paste this for you. Remember, don't cut the code, only copy because your friend like to do the same. Good luck. Here we are. And let's understand what I have here. Register access. This is a complex concept.
01:14:42.172 - 01:15:14.910, Speaker B: For now, let's understand this better. Perfect. I'm starting the same way. I prefer to have a space here. Let's add a space for you as well. It's better. Okay, so first line, the kind of license I'm using open source Mhe second line solidity version using pragma.
01:15:14.910 - 01:15:40.230, Speaker B: Then name of my contact has access. The definition is inside here. Now I have a lot of things here. This is so complex. Now it's okay. What I have here, the string now is not only one information. Now I have an array of information.
01:15:40.230 - 01:16:06.670, Speaker B: I have a list. So because of this, the array is defined with the brackets. It's private as well. It's colored info as well. Now I have a new kind of variable colored address. It means that I can only add save store addresses here. But this I put that it's public.
01:16:06.670 - 01:16:48.426, Speaker B: And it's to you to understand that every time that I define that some variable is public solidity, automatically create like a function with the name of my variable to get the information. We call it is a gitter. So you have like it is the owner function to get the information. Now I have a third kind of information here. A third kind of variable. This is the mapping, the mapping. It's a key value variable.
01:16:48.426 - 01:17:26.854, Speaker B: It means that each key has only one value. So for each address I have only one information, a boolean information. True or false. It's public as well and it's colored allow list. It means that address ABC, true address def, false, something like that. Now this is a new one for you as well. The constructors.
01:17:26.854 - 01:17:57.582, Speaker B: What is the constructor? Constructor, it's a function. Call it only in the moment that you are deploying the smart contract. We use this kind of function to initialize the contract. So what I'm initializing the owner. So the owner is the address who is sending the transaction. And here you can understand a bit more, something different. Messages.
01:17:57.582 - 01:19:01.778, Speaker B: We used to say that transactions are messages and sender is the address who is signing the transaction, who is sending the transaction. So this is the owner and also I'm adding the owner, the wallet, who is creating the content to the allow list. Here I have another interesting point that this is new for solidity as well. The event events are not stored directly on blockchain, but you can have events to monitor the blockchain. You can create a web services that is monitoring the blockchain and getting events information. The name of my event is info change. Here I have two strings.
01:19:01.778 - 01:20:03.382, Speaker B: One is the old information that I have inside my content and the new information. Here I have another new concept for you in solidity. So this content is for the adverse developers, sorry, the beginners. Now I know that this content specifically is a diverse. Okay, you need more time to understand everything. So the modifier is something that we create and then we can add, we can attach on functions and each function that has this modifier, you have this condition, for example, so I have a modifier colored only owner. And the inquiry is that the account who is sending this transaction is the same that I saved before being the owner.
01:20:03.382 - 01:20:42.166, Speaker B: If it's not, are you present the message only owner? If it is, yes. The underscore means continue the code. Okay, where I'm using this modifier, I will go scroll up and down. I'm going to other points. Okay, here at the end of my content, you can see that I have two functions, the add member and the delete member. Only owner can do this. So only the wallet who created the content can add new members or delete new members.
01:20:42.166 - 01:21:11.700, Speaker B: How is this is to say that that address is true, can modify the list or it's false, cannot modify the information. Only this. Let's come back here because I have another modifier. I have the only allow list. And wait, I must change this.
01:21:13.430 - 01:21:13.890, Speaker A: Change.
01:21:13.960 - 01:22:09.794, Speaker B: On your as well because I change the white list to be an allow list. Okay, so only allow list means that only the address who is in that list, it's here in that list can change the information. If it's not, I'm presenting the message only allow list. And if it yes, let's continue the code. This underscore is to continue the code where I'm using the only allow list. You can see here if I try to set some information settings again, only allow list if you like to add their new information, only allow list as well.
01:22:09.992 - 01:22:10.740, Speaker A: Okay.
01:22:12.650 - 01:22:50.254, Speaker B: Then let's go forward getinfo because now I have a list array with a lot of information. Get info, you bring it to you, you return it to you. Only one information, only one position that we call it the index. And by the way, the index start on zero. So if I have three positions, the position has index zero, index one, index two. Okay, the list start with the index zero. Set info.
01:22:50.254 - 01:23:53.366, Speaker B: Now I change a bit. The concept of set info set info is to update information in one position. So I must say which position, which index I'm using and what is the new information. Every time that I'm doing a setting for me updating the information, I will emit the event info change with the information that was here and the new information and then I'm updating the information. Okay, add the info. It's a new function for you as well is to add your new information on my list. Every time that you have a list and you must add your new information, this will be added at the end and the comment push is adding the information at the end of my list.
01:23:53.548 - 01:23:54.280, Speaker A: Okay.
01:23:57.210 - 01:24:42.920, Speaker B: And I have a new function as well called list info. And this is here to present to you all the information that I have on my list. Be careful with this function. If you create. Imagine that I create array so huge thousand of information and I try to cow this list info. Probably I will not get a response. Why? Because if you are using this with a really big list, this will not fit you have out of memory to receive the information.
01:24:42.920 - 01:25:00.266, Speaker B: In that case, I should have some ranges and. Okay, let's bring the information from one to ten or from the index, ten to 20, something like that. But this is for the Dutch only now.
01:25:00.368 - 01:25:01.020, Speaker A: Okay.
01:25:02.030 - 01:25:06.922, Speaker B: And we already talked about add member and delete member, so.
01:25:06.976 - 01:25:07.580, Speaker A: Good.
01:25:09.310 - 01:25:20.150, Speaker B: Let's see if you have some question related to this. I need checking the chat now. Okay.
01:25:21.440 - 01:25:22.190, Speaker A: It.
01:25:24.880 - 01:25:34.436, Speaker B: Yes, I would. I mean, not covering unit tests on discurse.
01:25:34.488 - 01:25:35.090, Speaker A: Okay.
01:25:35.620 - 01:26:12.420, Speaker B: At the end, in the last day I will follow you some path to do this. But we can do it exactly like Lucas said, it's more advanced. And this is not covering by this cursor. Patrick Collins create amazing cursor related to this. I recommend it to you. Yes. So based in the constructor only the sender is in the allo list in the beginning.
01:26:12.520 - 01:26:13.216, Speaker A: Yes.
01:26:13.398 - 01:26:53.454, Speaker B: And how the other is Daniel? Is that like this? Okay, we are going to deploy this now. Okay. And I know that this is a lot of information and it's a bit fast. I try to be slow, but if it's so fast to you, no problem. You can see the class later and try again and review it before tomorrow. Okay, let's deploy it. So I may go into the deployed contacts part.
01:26:53.454 - 01:27:03.682, Speaker B: Here we are. Hash access. It's selected on content and click on deploy. The content is still here?
01:27:03.736 - 01:27:04.754, Speaker A: Yes. Good.
01:27:04.872 - 01:27:30.402, Speaker B: Let's see. Only allow list. Okay, perfect. Deploy and then add here your name and register access address. Good luck, guys. Deploy. Sending the transaction to the blockchain.
01:27:30.402 - 01:27:56.902, Speaker B: Confirm here and here it's painting. And now it's confirm it. And here we are. I have the register access over there. Oh, I love that. I have the students so fast. They are faster than me.
01:27:56.902 - 01:28:11.980, Speaker B: I love this. Congrats for you, everyone. Satka, Sylvia Tebow. A lot of names. That is hard to me to say. Sorry. But you are amazing.
01:28:11.980 - 01:28:34.690, Speaker B: Here we are. So let's understand this in a practical way. Now, who is the owner? My wallet. What I have on this info? Nothing. So let's add the first information. Changing only this. Add info.
01:28:34.690 - 01:29:30.130, Speaker B: So adding the first information on my list, it's confirmed. If I go to list info. Here we are. I have the chain link over there. And what more? Now I'd like to add the bootcamp. So add info. It's confirmed.
01:29:30.130 - 01:29:57.478, Speaker B: Now if I go to list info, I have the chain link bootcamp. They are different indexes, different positions on my list. Let's change the second position. So I go to set info. I expand the set info. The index is one. Index zero.
01:29:57.584 - 01:29:58.510, Speaker A: Chain link.
01:29:58.660 - 01:30:26.294, Speaker B: Index one, boot camp. So index one. I'd like to do this. It will be now the boot camp to range page file. So I'm changing not the chaining part, only the index one, the boot camp.
01:30:26.412 - 01:30:27.080, Speaker A: Okay.
01:30:37.200 - 01:31:12.970, Speaker B: Confirm. Let's wait a bit on this. It's done. So if I come back here to the list info now, you can see that J link is the same. Bootcamp 2024 was updated. So great. Now I'd like to have someone interacting with me.
01:31:12.970 - 01:32:24.232, Speaker B: Lucas, are you here? Could you share your address with me? If you are doing the content, I'd like to allow you to change my contact to add a new information. Let's wait. Or anyone that likes to do this with me as well. Okay, Lucas didn't deploy it. So who would like to update my concept? Okay, who are you? What's your name? Okay, who are you? What's your name? PI. Okay, are you add you on my content and I share my content with you.
01:32:24.286 - 01:32:24.890, Speaker A: Okay.
01:32:28.430 - 01:32:50.142, Speaker B: Before that. So let's add you on my list. So add the member. I'm adding romainpier to my list. Here we are. Homemade. Pierre, you'd like to see my concert? It's here in some place.
01:32:50.276 - 01:32:50.990, Speaker A: Here we are.
01:32:51.060 - 01:33:32.040, Speaker B: I put my being there first. Let's see how long you be here. And I can edit this for you as well. Perfect. Okay, before that, in a few minutes. So, Homin Pierre, you'll be able to change my content. I prefer if you add a new information on my content.
01:33:32.040 - 01:33:47.600, Speaker B: But if you change it, it's up to you. Let's see. Because now you are on my list. If I get in you now. And let's see if you are on my list. I'm going to the allow list, paste your address and I can see.
01:33:47.670 - 01:33:48.144, Speaker A: True.
01:33:48.262 - 01:34:21.106, Speaker B: So now you can change my content. Okay, let's see if you did it. Not yet. I'm waiting a bit more. And I'd like to see the content from another person. So, Ashok, are you getting your content? This is your wallet or your content? Let's get it. Let's find you first register.
01:34:21.106 - 01:34:46.304, Speaker B: Trouble is the next. So you are here, Ashok. This is your register access address. First of all, I added this for me. So using the IP address, I have another instance that it's your contact, not mining. Here we are. This is yours, not mining.
01:34:46.304 - 01:34:53.192, Speaker B: So, if I try to check my address here. Hello.
01:34:53.246 - 01:34:53.850, Speaker A: List.
01:34:54.300 - 01:35:12.060, Speaker B: You can see that I'm not in Ashok list. So, if I try to add some information, let's see his list. Ashok chain link bootcamp 2024. Let's see if I can add some information. No, I can't.
01:35:12.400 - 01:35:13.150, Speaker A: Okay.
01:35:15.040 - 01:35:23.890, Speaker B: So I'm not sending the transaction. Sometimes mix create a horror. When I do this. Let's see if they create a problem to me.
01:35:25.560 - 01:35:26.310, Speaker A: Yes.
01:35:27.240 - 01:35:43.492, Speaker B: When we do these kind of things, I must talk with the remix team. Because now I have problems that I cannot access. Nothing. So I will refresh my remix. Now, if you have the same problem, refresh your remix.
01:35:43.556 - 01:35:44.170, Speaker A: Okay.
01:35:50.680 - 01:36:21.040, Speaker B: After refresh, I'm opening the register access. Going to deploy endurance transactions and Kme two injected provider again. Now I must get my content not deployed again. Here is my concept. Here we are not here. So this is my content, not Ashok. And let's see my list now.
01:36:21.040 - 01:36:34.230, Speaker B: Yes. Chain link rocks. Thank you, romaine. Pierre. So romaine is able to do this, not the others. Okay. I have more people that would like to interact with me.
01:36:34.230 - 01:36:58.750, Speaker B: Let's add ashok, one of you guys, please allow me myself to change your content. Artur. Okay. Yeah. You get your content in 1 minute. I'm adding Ashok on mine now. And I will get Artur contact and interact with him.
01:36:58.750 - 01:37:18.240, Speaker B: So, this is mine. This is Artur. Let's see your list. Artur chain ink boot camp 2024. My soul. Add info. No, I think you didn't.
01:37:18.240 - 01:37:49.816, Speaker B: Probably you added my content. You must add my address. So if you'd like to allow me to change your contact, you must add my address. That is this. Exactly. This is the so account. Yes.
01:37:49.816 - 01:38:10.964, Speaker B: And Dinesh. Yes. You can add someone here as your member. You can interact. It would be so amazing if you start to interact between the others. And I must refresh my remix again. Let's get mine.
01:38:10.964 - 01:38:36.000, Speaker B: No, this is not mine. This is mine. Heister invite and injected provider at the address. This is my contact. Let's see how is my contact now. I had more people in my contact. So I have you, Romaine, Ashok, Sylvia, you are on my content in 1 minute.
01:38:37.860 - 01:38:38.610, Speaker A: Yes.
01:38:43.380 - 01:39:30.384, Speaker B: Let's see my list. What I did wrong? I did something wrong. I lost my contract now. Yes, it's the same. So Augustine, how can you allow me on your allow list? This is my address. You must get my address and do the ad member part, okay? And you are so curious related to the gas fees, it seems that it's high today. I didn't check about it.
01:39:30.384 - 01:40:08.268, Speaker B: Let's see, why is it this way? When I created the content here, this is the transaction. We are on testnet guys. Okay, it was this. I don't know, we must multiply this. Like if you multiply for 2000, something like that. We have here like $60 something like that. But this is testnet guys, we are on testnet, should not worry about this now.
01:40:08.268 - 01:40:34.502, Speaker B: Beginners. So this is the point. I don't have more people over there. Let's see if I am on your list now. Arthur, first of all let's get your content again. So this is the same. Or you can see here that I have any space.
01:40:34.502 - 01:41:00.654, Speaker B: This can be a problem. You can see that the IP address was not working because of this space. Let's first of all check if my address is over there. I mean not in your list yet.
01:41:00.772 - 01:41:01.440, Speaker A: Okay.
01:41:09.510 - 01:41:43.422, Speaker B: Added me. Okay, let's see who are you? Let's see if you added me and you're looking forward to using another contract. I can get my address here as well. Hello vist. No you didn't. Guys, be careful. Probably you are adding my contract address, but you must add my wallet address.
01:41:43.422 - 01:42:19.580, Speaker B: Okay, but let's answer some questions for you now, we are almost finishing the class. Thank you Hasif. And to you, let's add some. I will add more information in the presentation later some references for you. But for now I'd like to share with you something interesting. Let's go to my.
01:42:21.550 - 01:42:22.700, Speaker A: Here we are.
01:42:23.150 - 01:43:31.902, Speaker B: Let's go to my GitHub. And where is this registered learn solidity? I share this with you now, later, remember that I told you that you create a git, bulky without everything, step by step. But for now, if you'd like to get a bit more related to solidity, what I have here, this is the register, but I have one by one adding some information. Let's get the one, the four. The eight, like the one is almost the same that we did, the four here, I mean introducing the concepts of the type address, the message sender, the owner. If so, I add some parts here, the eight I put out together. So the eight has the event, the set info.
01:43:31.902 - 01:44:01.642, Speaker B: And I have here 15 contents where I'm adding some concepts by content. And you can understand one by one what has changed. What is the new concept that I'm introducing over there. Okay, now what I did with you, I came from one to I think the last something like that. But we have a lot in the middle that you can learn as well.
01:44:01.776 - 01:44:02.460, Speaker A: Okay.
01:44:04.430 - 01:44:55.944, Speaker B: Let'S see. This is interesting. Is there any way to visualize the list of allowed address? No, not in the way that I did. Because when we have a mapping, you cannot list a mapping in the way that we are listing an array. The array I can list in the way that I did here. The listing foo this works for array, this not work for mapping. And I did this, it was my goal in this way because I don't like to let people know all the people that is alloyed.
01:44:55.944 - 01:45:05.252, Speaker B: So in this way you can check if you are all it, but not check everyone. This was my design in this conflict.
01:45:05.336 - 01:45:05.970, Speaker A: Okay.
01:45:10.580 - 01:45:45.356, Speaker B: Let'S see. And remember guys, we are on castnet. So for now doesn't matter how much is costing this transaction because we are learning and learning for free. I'm teaching you for free and you are on testnet for free. And don't use mainnet to burn your money. Learning and putting transactions that doesn't make sense to have this on Mainnet. We have testnets to do this.
01:45:45.538 - 01:45:46.270, Speaker A: Okay.
01:45:48.800 - 01:46:13.840, Speaker B: And let's go forward. I think we are good for now. Yes, thank you, Bliss. You are welcome. It's a really pleasure to me to be here. Same tip. Amazing.
01:46:13.840 - 01:46:24.100, Speaker B: Perfect. Yes.
01:46:29.590 - 01:46:30.338, Speaker A: It.
01:46:30.504 - 01:47:01.210, Speaker B: I think you are confusing some concepts. Okay. Because the point is that private, if the function is private, doesn't matter if the person is outlook or not. Okay. The function must be public and inside you check if that address can or not do that interaction.
01:47:01.290 - 01:47:01.920, Speaker A: Okay.
01:47:07.730 - 01:47:34.994, Speaker B: And you are welcome. I think we are finishing. Do you have some extra message for today? Thank you, Jeff, you are my partner here. You and Javier, we did this together. Lucas, thank you so much. Lucas is another brazilian guy. Lucas is a developer expert.
01:47:34.994 - 01:48:17.202, Speaker B: So it's a volunteer that help us and learn a lot of us as well. He's certified in some products of chainings. He's in the process of this. And did you saw a lot of messages from him in the chat? He helped a lot with this. And probably Friday Lucas will be here with you as well. Because Friday I'm not here Friday it's a session only to you to solve out of the debts. So prepare yourself that Friday you will be with a lot of developer experts and also another developer advocate.
01:48:17.202 - 01:48:31.210, Speaker B: He should be with you and community advocates that you solve the debits. It's like let's take a break and be prepared to next week that it will be like advanced week.
01:48:31.360 - 01:48:32.060, Speaker A: Okay.
01:48:37.170 - 01:49:07.168, Speaker B: And I'm finishing now. Perfect. And I saw some comments related to solidity. Be like Java, like JavaScript. Yes. I think solidity can have a bit of JavaScript for me, a bit of C sharp. I came from the net word and C sharp.
01:49:07.168 - 01:49:21.272, Speaker B: So all of these are part of solidity. This is a new language. If you are starting from zero, start on solidity directly. But if you know other languages it will help you as well.
01:49:21.406 - 01:49:22.090, Speaker A: Okay.
01:49:25.580 - 01:49:54.764, Speaker B: So thank you so much everyone. See you tomorrow on session three. By the way, before if you didn't get the presentation, here we are. This is the care code for the presentation tomorrow you are seeing that I'm adding more slides in the presentation. It's the same archive that I'm adding all the slides in the same presentation.
01:49:54.892 - 01:49:55.580, Speaker A: Okay.
01:49:55.750 - 01:50:35.552, Speaker B: And remember that we have where is the tasks? Here is the tasks. In the tasks you can see that I asked your hash address, not the hashes yet, but iosk this as well. So you can start to fill the tasks that we did. And if you go back tomorrow to the semi form, use the same email in the form because you can come back to the form and update your answers because I was asking more questions. Day by day we have new tasks and you must feel inside the form.
01:50:35.686 - 01:50:36.370, Speaker A: Okay.
01:50:38.500 - 01:50:50.912, Speaker B: Related to this question, the smart content itself is saved but not the address. So be sure that you get your address of your content.
01:50:51.046 - 01:50:51.730, Speaker A: Okay.
01:50:56.980 - 01:51:00.980, Speaker B: So is this guys, see you tomorrow. Bye.
