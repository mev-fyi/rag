Until now, if you wanted to build anything, it had to be centralized, which means that your app or service could just be shut down. So you couldn't guarantee to your users that they could have access to your app. But web3, with cryptography and decentralization, changes everything. Now you can build an app that cannot be shut down, so you can guarantee to your users, globally, that they can have access to your service.
