00:00:00.250 - 00:00:33.778, Speaker A: First off, I just want to thank the loop ring team. Obviously, Brex, the Chainlink community, and the entire blockchain community who's joining us here today. Basically. Obviously, everybody's busy. So again, we certainly appreciate Brett and Johann for stopping by. The real goal, kind of, of this Q A is really to allow the community to learn more about the integration between loopring and Chainlink and exploring what makes this integration unique and beneficial to both the teams and the users of each and every one of these products. Just to briefly go over the agenda for the first 30 to 40 minutes, it's kind of going to be a Q and a fireside chat structure.
00:00:33.778 - 00:01:14.850, Speaker A: Well, I'll sort of ask some questions and allowing both Brecht and Johann to respond. And then this will then be followed by kind of ten to 15 minutes of sort of these Q and a questions which your community is working on. Now, if you want to submit a question, again, the pigeonhole app is a way to do so, and we're posting that link in the live stream right now for you. If you have a question that was not addressed for any reason, feel free to stop by either team's chat channels. I'll actually put all that in the kind of the comments, stuff like that about that. So if you want to find out more about loop ring, hop in one of their channels to speak to them on their discord or telegram or all the things that they've got going on, you can certainly do so. So, again, thank you guys for joining us, and we'll go ahead and get started.
00:01:14.850 - 00:01:23.960, Speaker A: So, first question, Brex, would you mind kind of introducing yourself and maybe giving us just a little bit of your background, maybe prior to loop ring and then sort of what you do for.
00:01:24.970 - 00:02:12.162, Speaker B: Great. So thanks to chainlink for organizing this and especially to Johan and Corey. So, yeah, I've started working for loop ring around two years ago now. I think before that, I was just normal software engineer. I studied software engineering at Ghent University, mainly because I was interested in most of my life, I've been trying to make games, but I haven't made anything successful yet in that part of my career. But, yeah, before loop ring, I worked for five years for graphine. So graphine was a gaming middleware company that made, like, virtual text streaming.
00:02:12.162 - 00:02:51.570, Speaker B: So if you're familiar with mega textures, that's kind of like the most general known name. So we did it the same, and they helped implement it in unreal engine and unity now as well. So, yeah, mostly, like, optimizing stuff on CPU and GPU, but yeah, then I heard of Ethereum. I didn't know about Ethereum. I thought it was just like bitcoin in the past. But then I started knowing Ethereum. I started knowing all the interesting crypto projects.
00:02:51.570 - 00:03:24.350, Speaker B: Noticed loop ring. The first thing I did for loop Ring was actually joining the optimization bounty. So they organized a couple of optimization bounties for protocol one and protocol two. I joined those optimization bounties. I was pretty good at it, and then I decided to join the team as a full member. And since then, yeah, I've been working full time for loop ring. Just at the beginning, it was protocol two.
00:03:24.350 - 00:03:43.860, Speaker B: I worked on getting it on Mainet, and then about a year ago, I started working on protocol three, which is now being used on Mainet. And, yeah, it's kind of like the big breakthrough for loop ring now.
00:03:44.310 - 00:03:55.586, Speaker A: Awesome. We'll definitely get a little bit more into kind of what you guys have sort of built that really makes you unique in this space. Johan, I think a lot of people know your background, but would you just mind at least sharing kind of what your role is for Chainlink?
00:03:55.778 - 00:03:56.374, Speaker C: Yeah, sure.
00:03:56.412 - 00:03:57.240, Speaker B: Hey, guys.
00:03:57.710 - 00:05:14.366, Speaker C: Yeah, so, very quickly, basically, at chainlink, I've been mostly working on getting users using Oracle. So basically working with them on the technical integration, seeing how they can easily consume the data, seeing where we can really pinpoint the current issues they have, and see how Chainlink can help them resolve the biggest problems these users are having. Right. So Defi is really a great occurrence for chainlink and kind of all these Dex protocols, like loop ring, all these breakthroughs are really incredibly important for us, just because for people who have been in crypto for a while, it seems like you are kind of like a man in a desert, right, where nothing was happening, and Defi is like this oasis where stuff is suddenly happening and people are using it. So, yeah, Chenlink wanted to make sure that we were part of this revolution, that we had all the tools to provide people with as much decentralization, security, and ease of use as possible. And the fact that loop ring has really been a protocol, which has been there for a while, I think you guys were for two years now. It's really been a big accomplishment for us, and we are super proud of it.
00:05:14.366 - 00:05:21.140, Speaker C: So that's very quickly what I do. As for background, I won't go into it because we won't have the same discussion every time, I guess.
00:05:22.470 - 00:05:36.790, Speaker A: Absolutely. Bret, kind of going back to you. Can you explain a little bit, kind of, about this new release that your team has just released and kind of maybe what makes it unique in terms of Ethereum and dexes and kind of what you guys have really just finalized.
00:05:37.130 - 00:06:28.790, Speaker B: Yeah, so loop ring, of course, is a protocol for decentralized centralized exchanges. So the biggest part of loop ring three is of course the scalability. So we've been doing like you and said, we've been doing decentralized changes using normal smart contracts. So everything, not everything, but mainly in smart contracts doing all the logic and smart contracts and the autumn matching off chain. So scalability was always kind of like part of the loop ring protocol. But now we've kind of taken a big leap forward in doing even more stuff off chain. So yeah, loop ring two most things, all the logic on chain to do the actual settlements, but order matching off chain.
00:06:28.790 - 00:07:38.618, Speaker B: But now in loop ring three, using zero knowledge proofs, we've even gone further. So even the settlement of the trades is also done off chain and circuits. So it's kind of like this big mathematical cryptographical thing that you can prove that you've done some computations correctly off chain, and then using a small proof, you can prove on chain that all those computations you did off chain are actually valid. So that's kind of like the big leap that protocol three introduces is that we use zero knowledge proofs. And that gives us large scalability improvements because the things we did on chain, like signatures, checking and doing the actual token transfers, those are still very expensive to do on chain. So like doing a token transfer is like 20,000 gas, checking a signature around 5000 gas. It's kind of like all these expensive things that we now don't need to do on chain anymore, which gives us large improvements in scalability.
00:07:38.618 - 00:07:57.540, Speaker B: Like with protocol two, we could do like two or three trades per second fully using Ethereum mainet, but now we're at around 2000 trades per second we can do. So that's kind of like the big picture of why looping three is so important for us.
00:07:58.310 - 00:08:12.618, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's very interesting how you have the sort of the benefits still of decentralization, but at the same point you sort of get some speeds that make it look and act like, I think, what normal people have kind of come to expect for trading and things like that.
00:08:12.784 - 00:08:53.910, Speaker B: Yeah, the other important thing is of course that we do that. So like we can do 2000 trades per second, but without any security, extra security assumptions than L2 ethereum. So it's as secure as protocol two, but with a large increase in scalability. We also have a mode that even has higher scalability like 16,000 traits per second, but that has a little bit less security. So if we don't post all the data on chain, then it's still pretty secure, but it's less secure than L2 of ethereum.
00:08:54.410 - 00:09:05.180, Speaker A: Great. All right. Yeah, thank you for that. So then that directly goes into. So how do chain link oracles or oracles come into play? Sort of in this particular situation?
00:09:05.550 - 00:09:53.350, Speaker B: Yeah. So for looping three, we also introduced LRC staking. So staking is used for in a couple of parts of our protocol. So the one part for Chainlink that we're using Chainlink for now is for the economic security of the protocol. So the way the protocol works is first there's an operator that kind of, like, batches all the trades, and then that block is first committed on chain, but hasn't yet been proven. So the thing about zero knowledge proofs today is that they take a long time to actually generate. So if you have big blocks, it can take a couple of minutes until you have generated the proof, which has kind of like a large latency until you did the proof on the exchange.
00:09:53.350 - 00:10:26.520, Speaker B: But then the actual finality of that trade is only when. The actual finality is only final when the zero knowledge proof is generated and it's posted on chain and validated. So we have like a two part system of committing blocks. At the first step, you just commit the block without actually generating the proof. So you can do. Generating a block is pretty cheap, very cheap. So the latency until it's on chain is also very fast.
00:10:26.520 - 00:11:09.618, Speaker B: So the block is on chain, but then it's still unsure if the block is actually valid. So that's where the LRC staking comes in. If an operator commits a block on chain that is invalid, then the operator is slashed, he loses some funds that he has staked on our contract. So that way there's some kind of economic finality. Like if you commit a block, but it's invalid, then the operator loses his money. So he doesn't want that to happen. So even without the actual proof there, there's already some kind of guarantees that your trade is final.
00:11:09.618 - 00:11:44.410, Speaker B: And that's why for that kind of staking, we use LRC. So the operator needs to stake a certain amount of LRC. And for setting that amount, we use chain link to do the USD to LRC conversion. So we can just say all the exchange needs to stake 50,000 USD. How much is this in LRC? And then if the operator does something wrong, we can just slash like $5,000. Of worth of in LRC.
00:11:44.930 - 00:11:54.770, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Thank you so much for that thorough explanation. So then, I guess the question then really goes to Johan, why does this kind of make sense for Chainlink?
00:11:55.510 - 00:13:11.740, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense. First, as I discussed, Chainlink is also a project which wants to help and support the ecosystem, right? So basically, we are seeing defi kind of sprawl up out of nowhere and really build so quickly. We want to make sure that we are here to give the developers on Ethereum the tools to be able to do what they need to do, basically for their DAP. So here, ensuring the security of stakers and the freelayers, which in consequence has huge kind of crypto economic guarantees and recurcutions, was very important for us. So deploying this oracle to support loop rings, there was really a priority. Secondly, of course, the way the chainlink network works is having node operators which basically get traffic through their nodes by supplying data and this data being used and consumed by users of the chaining protocol. So just like Ethereum, in order to work, needs traffic and needs use cases, Chainlink, in order to work, needs node operators who are getting traffic through their nodes and who have data which is being used on mainnet for real world tangible use cases, which should sustain for years.
00:13:11.740 - 00:13:51.734, Speaker C: I don't think loopring is going to have to change their whole crypto economic model. I mean, I won't talk for them, but I think having these kind of tangible use cases where basically the operators are insured traffic for a long time, was very important also for us. So, yeah, just like any protocol needs usage to sustain, Chainlink needs usage to sustain itself. And being able to help the ecosystem while doing it is, of course, a huge plus, because as node operators are getting traffic, it means they're actually providing reliable service to the industry that people need to consume and to have.
00:13:51.932 - 00:14:10.380, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much. I know a lot of the chainley community, especially kind of always wants to know how these kind of integrations happen. So can you kind of sort of walk me through the process? Like, how long ago were you guys first talking and sort of, what are the stages of kind of an integration like this look like?
00:14:11.010 - 00:14:42.840, Speaker C: Sure. So I was actually pretty familiar with the looping team for a while. We started talking Zoe integration and use cases, I think around end of November, if I'm not mistaken. The integration was actually extremely straightforward for a few reasons. First, the loop ring team moved extremely fast, which is really cool to see. So, Bret, I think you were done with the smart contract part in a few days or so at 05:00 a.m. Or something.
00:14:42.840 - 00:15:31.640, Speaker C: And on our side deploying reference contracts and coordinating with the operators is also extremely fast. So I think the way a typical integration goes is we find basically users or us, we discussed and we find a good use case where we can work on together. Right. We identify something either easy to do or medium short term, it can be whichever here it was something short term. It was pretty easy for both parties. We have a pretty precise timeline on when we want to do these things. There is work on the chaining side to basically set up the reference contract and for the node operators to basically buy the API keys required to run all of this and coordinate there.
00:15:31.640 - 00:16:03.134, Speaker C: Then the reference contract was set up. I think after a week on Mainnet of talking with loopring, and loopring started consuming and using it one week later. So the technical integration here went quite fast. I think it was two weeks, right, Brett, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's two weeks or two weeks and a few days, not more than this. Something like that, yeah, exactly. That's basically how it goes. So we coordinate, we speak together, and we find really cool use cases to work on.
00:16:03.134 - 00:16:30.680, Speaker C: And I think we have also some really cool stuff that we can work on later on and stuff. So it's only a beginning, I think with every user will be them to make sure that we don't want to have people consuming our contracts and then we don't talk or something. We want to make sure that we support them in their vision and that they never have a need to work on anything where Chainlink as a protocol and node operators could help them basically, which is data related, of course.
00:16:31.130 - 00:16:54.340, Speaker A: All right, thank you. I guess, Brett, why? We talked a little bit about what Chainlink oracles are being used for in terms of making sure that enough loop ring is staked if someone needs to be slashed, and what that USD amount is. Why does a decentralized oracle network make more sense than like a centralized oracle? Why essentially are you guys using chainlink for that?
00:16:55.910 - 00:17:54.020, Speaker B: So yeah, basically we just want to have the best price seats because even for further plans for further integrations, we want to have kind of like not a single source of the prices for other tokens. Maybe we can talk about it now, but the other thing that we might use chainlink for is for doing stuff like stop orders so that the operator can only do the trade when the price is below a certain price. Using anything other than some kind of decentralized price feed just wouldn't work. So even just using the prices of our own exchange is just not good enough because it's too easily manipulated. So we really need to have a wide range of different price feeds that are combined and one price that we can trust.
00:17:56.390 - 00:18:20.006, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you very much. So now we're kind of through the first 20 minutes or so. So what we'll do now is kind of get to some of our community, kind of Q and a questions that they've asked on our pigeonhole live app. So, guys, if you want to get your questions in their community, make sure to do that quickly. But we got a couple that got quite a few votes, and I'll kind of ask a question. Some of these are probably going to be more Johan, or some of these will probably be more Brecht.
00:18:20.006 - 00:18:53.240, Speaker A: But whoever feels like they can answer it, feel free to step forward. You've kind of addressed this a little bit, but this is sort of our top question. So, where do you see chain link and loop rings? Partnership or collaboration advancing in the six months time? And then the second part of that, how dependent upon this is E 2.0? Or kind of. What does the next version of e sort of mean for something like this? So we'll go back kind of the first one. So, do you see kind of a chance for further integration? You already talked a little bit about that Brex, but if you want to elaborate anymore. Johan, if you want to elaborate anything more on that.
00:18:54.810 - 00:19:29.566, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll just finish with what I was for. The stock orders are one thing, but we're also working on a smart wallet. So for smart wallets, we also envision things like a daily limit. So the smart wallet can contain lots of tokens. And then there's a daily limit, also configured in some kind of $100 or $1,000, whatever. And then the user can spend that much in a single day. But then it's, like, shared over all the tokens.
00:19:29.566 - 00:19:40.022, Speaker B: So we need the dollar price for all the tokens, realistic price for all the tokens in that case. So that's another case that we're looking at.
00:19:40.156 - 00:19:42.166, Speaker A: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.
00:19:42.348 - 00:19:42.726, Speaker C: Kind of.
00:19:42.748 - 00:20:11.630, Speaker A: Next question. This one's a little bit more for Johan. And obviously, it's always a hot topic. It's kind of staking or penalty deposits. But when penalty deposits or staking is in place for Chainlink, do you expect this to kind of further increase the usability of this integration? So, would penalty deposits, when that comes in place, would that kind of unleash something new for loop ring, or how would something like that maybe work, or would it add anything more to this integration?
00:20:12.210 - 00:20:37.486, Speaker C: Great question. So two things here. I think there is usability, and there is also, secondly, security. Right. It's obvious that currently the protocol is extremely secure. We can't really do better right now as far as security, just because it's extremely hard to combine the level of security and decentralization chain Inc. Already offers.
00:20:37.486 - 00:21:14.450, Speaker C: Right. Crypto and economic guarantees can also be mixed up as some kind as trusted, how do we say, defensive depth approach. So we get more and more defensive securities, defensive kind of points as we go to basically secure the protocol even more. Right. So it can improve the security. As far as allowing more use cases for loop ring, I don't think that would really be the case. I think the feeds we have right now are more than enough to handle any kind of value loop ring would basically rely on for their staking.
00:21:14.450 - 00:22:06.580, Speaker C: And I think the good thing for usability is being able to set up these networks more easily with basically, staking can allow you to trust people that you don't really know and who don't have an established reputation, just because if they screw up, they lose a lot of their funds. Right. So as far as setting up new networks for users, which I don't think loop ring would really be concerned by this because they already have these networks. But for people who want to set up new networks and who want to find node operators easily, et cetera, node operators offering staking would allow more trust, basically. So you would be able to trust them more easily. So two approaches, security usability. But in any case, I think staking is always good to have.
00:22:08.150 - 00:22:31.130, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much. Yawn. This one is probably also geared a little bit more towards you, but also, Bret could probably add to this a little bit. But obviously, loop ring zero knowledge proofs the speed, everything that that sort of means. Do you see Chainlink oracles or the Chainlink oracle network kind of maybe using zero knowledge proofs in the future and then kind of. What applications might you see something like that be used for?
00:22:31.280 - 00:23:26.970, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. It's actually quite like maybe we should ask a loop ring because they know their stuff. As far as we've been looking at zero proof knowledge for a while, we have multiple utilizations for it that we could think of. So all of this is basically a research. It's working on what we could use, what we can't use. We have to be very careful about this stuff, because once it gets into the protocol, it's hard to get it out of course, zero knowledge proofs can be very interesting for when data gets aggregated and feeding back this data on chain, I think that would be a really cool use case for chainlink. I'm not saying that's something we should do or anything, but that's something we've definitely looked at, because zero proof knowledge can have many applications, and one of them is making the way you compute data much more kind efficient.
00:23:26.970 - 00:23:40.290, Speaker C: Right. So basically, the way responses would be done on chain whenever an oracle is responding would cost much less to have as far as gas fees go for ethereum.
00:23:41.110 - 00:24:01.260, Speaker A: All right, awesome. Brex, what about you with zero knowledge proofs? Obviously it's a big deal and people have really taken notice, I think, of what you guys have done with that. But do you see any sort of future use cases or maybe even outside of loop ring? But what do you think zero knowledge proofs kind of sort of unlocks for the rest of sort of the crypto blockchain community?
00:24:02.110 - 00:24:49.510, Speaker B: I think in general, it unlocks scalable blockchains, blockchains in general. So I think zero knowledge proofs will just be used for creating the next generation of blockchains just on layer one. So the layer one algorithms will also use zero knowledge proofs in certain cases. If you've been following Vitalik, he's been doing all sorts of research on the Ethereum research forums. So I think that's kind of like the main thing for the crypto system. It will be a basic building block of all blockchains.
00:24:51.470 - 00:25:21.220, Speaker A: Great. Thank you very much. Okay. Kind of like the last one here to sort of wrap it off, which is kind of future forward looking. But when decentralized exchanges kind of take off or maybe grow more than what they are now, how do you see it affect the greater financial world? So I guess we'll start with you, Bret. Do you think there's, I guess, further applications for sort of decentralized exchanges, or do you think this is really going to impact the way that maybe the financial world does business 1020 years from now?
00:25:24.890 - 00:26:34.700, Speaker B: Full disclosure, I asked Matthew some hints for this question because I'm mainly a technical guy, but, yeah, so he said the power of the choice. So you don't have to use decentralized, non custodial solutions, but at least you have the choice. And with our current system, that's probably as efficient almost as centralized exchanges. It's also like a choice now to use has centralized exchanges or decentralized exchanges. So, yeah, it gives users a lot of choice on what to do and what to use in the western world, it's like less, you could say less important because we have trusted entities. There's all kind of laws that need to be respected by all the entities. But in smaller countries, more corrupt countries, it's much more important that at least these people have access to decentralized finance applications that they can trust.
00:26:34.700 - 00:26:37.594, Speaker B: So. Yeah, something like that.
00:26:37.712 - 00:26:52.240, Speaker A: Great. Perfect. Johann, do you want to add anything to that again? I'll kind of ask it again. But when you feel that decentralized exchanges or when decentralized exchanges take off or some of these other decentralized financial products that we're seeing, how do you see it affecting kind of the greater financial world?
00:26:53.090 - 00:27:18.418, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I mean, to be honest, I really like this kind of concept of right, of like you have the right to choose right. And I feel like blockchain in general is kind of that right. Like you have the right to go and use bitcoin or you have the right to pay in US dollar in fiat. Right. That's the thing which really blockchain offers. I feel like it's hard to predict where all these products will go.
00:27:18.418 - 00:28:08.698, Speaker C: I think they'll have a huge impact, at least on countries which don't have the same level of infrastructure, banking infrastructure, that we currently have in the western world. That's my feeling. I think this has been said many times. Right. But I think it's very hard to see and to say where Defi will go and what will happen once it gets really adopted, because it keeps unsurprising and because it keeps having effects which we wouldn't even have predicted one year or two years ago in our wide old dream. Like saying that there would be a few million of ether wrapped up right now in protocols while the Dow hack happened barely three years ago. It's kind of insane, right? So I think it's very hard to say.
00:28:08.698 - 00:28:19.740, Speaker C: I'm honestly, obviously extremely optimistic about what will happen. But, yeah, I think we'll get surprised, as we always get surprised with this space.
00:28:20.190 - 00:28:42.510, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much. Well, everybody, that kind of wraps up our video Q A for today. I want to just say special thanks to Brecht and Johan for joining us and all the community members that hopped in and viewed the stream. I'd also like to thank Matthew from Loop ring as well, who helped me kind of put this together. And you heard sort of Brecht reference him earlier. We're looking to do a lot more of these in the future, so make sure you subscribe to our channel for more content from us.
00:28:42.510 - 00:28:52.450, Speaker A: But again, if you have any suggestions. Anything else you'd like us to do differently, we're always open to it. But thank you for sharing your time today, everybody. And we look forward to doing more of these in the future. Thank you again. Breck. Thank you again, Johan.
