00:00:12.750 - 00:00:47.260, Speaker A: You. Hello everyone. I'm so happy here with you now. And this is our first official day of the spring hackathon. And I'd like to tell you that now in this moment I am in another hackathon. So this is amazing. I can be in a physical hackathon, in person hackathon and in the online hackathon in the same way.
00:00:47.260 - 00:01:42.926, Speaker A: This is really awesome and I'd like to invite you to prepare yourself to next time go to in person hackathon too. They usually are a bit different. Like the online hackathons used to be longer like one month like this hackathon. But when we have physical hackathon in person hackathon, they used to be like one weekend start on Friday night and you had until Sunday to create a new project. You normally don't sleep so much but this is normal. And again, you will be so proud of yourself because it's really amazing. And I will show you a bit the venue here.
00:01:42.926 - 00:03:06.210, Speaker A: Look at this amazing venue. Oh sorry. Yes, I'm back. So sorry. What happened? I have two screens here and they all that fall down. But I'm back here and I just show you a bit about this house on venue where it happened. Hackathon.
00:03:06.210 - 00:03:56.690, Speaker A: Oh, you cannot hear me now. Let's check this first. Hello, is my sound okay again? Where is this now? Yes. Okay great. So I just show you a bit about how we are here and I think we are ready to start our first online hands on session. And the goal here is to create your first smart content. Wow.
00:03:56.690 - 00:04:52.814, Speaker A: Are you prepared to create your first smart content? Let's see if everything is okay. Yes, let's answer a question before it started officially so more people can join us. Started yesterday. So we have here now a lot of hackers starting their projects. Maybe some of them can continue their projects in our hack layer. This is possible. But another interesting point, it was not only a hackathon, we also have a week of events, a week of different workshops.
00:04:52.814 - 00:05:28.160, Speaker A: Like we have another developer advocate from Chainlink Labs doing a workshop, a presentation about Chainlink. We have a live game here for developers by Chainlink and Austin. It was amazing. Maybe we have it online with you. Wait, you can wait for this. What is this? I think now it's time to start our workshop now and I need to prepare some points with you. Let's share my screen.
00:05:28.160 - 00:06:02.460, Speaker A: Yes, this is my screen. Wait a minute. Why my screen is so crazy? Wait, this is weird. Really strange. It could be terrible if any choose only one screen. But let's try it wait a minute. Are you try again.
00:06:02.460 - 00:06:30.340, Speaker A: Let's end it. Yeah, it is still here. Probably. Yes. Oh, now it's good. Yes, I think now it's good. Now you can see my screen.
00:06:30.340 - 00:07:04.094, Speaker A: Yes, almost done. I only need to go to the right place because I lost you. Yes, the presentation are in the wrong screen. Let's put in the right screen. Ask. And now it. Let's see.
00:07:04.094 - 00:07:29.510, Speaker A: Yes, now it's okay for you. I believe that it's okay. So this is our hackathon. I'm so happy to be here and I don't have so much to talk. Before we start to coding, it's time to code. This is the first hands on session. So this is an introduction to solidity and to remix.
00:07:29.510 - 00:07:56.880, Speaker A: This is me. My name is Solenji Gaetus. The people usually call me soul like the sun. And I am developer advocate here at changing clubs. And this is my contact me. This is our agenda. I was watching the patriot talk before me and I saw a lot of interesting questions and adversity questions.
00:07:56.880 - 00:08:26.258, Speaker A: Here we are. Take care of the beginners. Really beginners. The first thing that I do here is to be uninstall my metamask and install it again with you. So you will learn how to install metamask. Then I will show you how to use remix. And what is remix? After this, you create your first smart context.
00:08:26.258 - 00:08:52.586, Speaker A: You understand a bit more about the permissions in smart context and how to interact with smart context. So is this. We would like to do all of this now in 1 hour, 15 minutes now. So let's go. This is the important point for me. Everything you happen in this patch. This is a collaborative path.
00:08:52.586 - 00:09:12.594, Speaker A: All of us can write and can erase everything the same time. So be careful. But let's go to the pet. Probably I have it here in another. Yes, here. No, it's here. This is the pet.
00:09:12.594 - 00:09:38.414, Speaker A: Let me share with you. Wait a minute. Yes, I come back. I am back with you. And this is our pet. Probably you need to go to the same link that I have here. Let's share this with you.
00:09:38.414 - 00:09:57.780, Speaker A: You need this. This is the comment for you. I just add the comment in the chat. Let's go everyone to this. Hello. Yes, I like your idea. Let's do something.
00:09:57.780 - 00:10:21.020, Speaker A: Let's add your name here. My name is Saul. And everyone get a new line and put your name. Hey, so nice. Wow, we have 65 people now. It's amazing. I love this.
00:10:21.020 - 00:10:48.286, Speaker A: Yes, we can write in the same line. And both of you, you figure out how to solve this. Wow, I really love this. So nice. Eight people here. Wow. Yes, you are putting your name and you uninstalled my metamask.
00:10:48.286 - 00:11:32.364, Speaker A: Now you know that I have my metamask here. Are you install it and install it again with you removed by Metamask. Wow. 99% people here, more than 100. Wow. Let's start it with the requirements metamask IO widgets. So add your naming before here and I will start in this point.
00:11:32.364 - 00:12:23.390, Speaker A: Okay, so let's go. Like I said before, I just put the link for Metamask IO. This is an online web wallet that is injected in your browser. It means that when you are in other websites you can use this wallet and you are using the metamask wallet inside the remix and understand both of this. I need to install my wallet now. It's a bit too strange because in fact I will download the extension to my chrome. I'm using chrome now.
00:12:23.390 - 00:13:31.300, Speaker A: I need to go down and install metamat for Chrome. Yes, add to Chrome. I added this text extension with this it. Is it okay? Probably. Okay, it's installing my metamask now. How many people do you have here? Oh no, I can't believe that's happened. Or no, exactly.
00:13:31.300 - 00:13:51.900, Speaker A: Someone just erased the pet. Oh, it's a shame. Remember that I said that we are together here. We can do this. It's the first time that this happened. But it's okay. I put my name again.
00:13:51.900 - 00:14:46.220, Speaker A: Yes, okay it and no problem. I have some links outside here that I will add with you. Sorry, Bella, you go down and do remember that we are installing metamask. Okay, this is metamask and here get started. I'm creating a new wallet. So create a new wallet. Not now.
00:14:46.220 - 00:15:27.324, Speaker A: You will create a password wherever you'd like to have it. It. And the goal of the pad is to copy and paste the material for you. No, I don't see the video now I know this is an interesting point, like think that I will show now my secret phrase. You never ever do this. Okay, I'm doing this because I'm teaching you. So the wallet.
00:15:27.324 - 00:15:59.950, Speaker A: I use this wallet only for a test net. And if I lost all the cryptos that I have here is not a problem because this is a test. Yes, we know that the paddy will not work. We have some problems here. It's a shame, guys, we will try to do this in another way. Okay, I will learn another way to do this because I really love to do this, but it's not a problem. Let's come back here.
00:15:59.950 - 00:16:39.888, Speaker A: This is my twelve year old normally you don't share this with no one. Okay. And because I said that I'd like to remember this now I need to put all my words here again. And I know that the pad is gone. Okay. It's a shame someone don't like to play with us. It.
00:16:39.888 - 00:17:08.896, Speaker A: Yes, this is my words. Okay, now done. You know, now that I have a wallet, I'm close here. Or I can go up a bit. You can see that I am in the Chinu mainet. We have so many testnets that are not appear. Now it's very important that you go to the test net.
00:17:08.896 - 00:17:31.690, Speaker A: So go to show, write testnet networks. And you put on show test networks. Is this. Now you can see that I have your test network. We can use any of them. Today I will use. Good.
00:17:31.690 - 00:18:01.520, Speaker A: I don't have yet any testnet. And I will add the links directly in our chat. Because I know that the bed is done again. Oh, no, wait. Maybe you work. Next step. We need to have some cryptos in our wallet.
00:18:01.520 - 00:18:21.792, Speaker A: Like I said before, today I use the girly network. We have others. And in the girly network we have two faucets over there. That's this. Let's go here. And I need to go back to your screen. This is the girly.
00:18:21.792 - 00:18:43.330, Speaker A: You have your simple faucet here. We need adders to interact with our smart context. To create our first smart context. This is the curly faucet. So I copy the address of my wallet as you see here. Prove that I am uni. I hope so.
00:18:43.330 - 00:19:06.950, Speaker A: And the request? No. Wow. Only available to Ens domain. So we cannot use this. I change for another network and use it directly. The chain link houses. You'll be better for us.
00:19:06.950 - 00:19:44.140, Speaker A: Sorry, girly, I'd like to use you, but I couldn't. Let's go to COVID network. No, early COVID network. I can go to another faucet. It's better to use the chain link faucet. Here it is. This is the faucet.
00:19:44.140 - 00:20:20.184, Speaker A: And in the faucet I will connect my wallet. Connect wallet metamask. Let's refresh this. Yes, it's not connecting because I have this page opened before and I installed my wallet. Installed again. Now it works. Here we are.
00:20:20.184 - 00:20:45.010, Speaker A: I have my metamask connected to my wallet. And you can see that my wallet. Let's pin my wallet. My wallet was in Covent and here I am in coven too. Wow, this is great. It's working. I'm so happy with this.
00:20:45.010 - 00:21:16.960, Speaker A: And you can see the address of my wallet here. And I'm requesting coven. I don't need the link tokens now. I only need the Ethereum. On coven I prove that I am again and request. This is the transaction hash in a few minutes. Are you happy? 0.1
00:21:16.960 - 00:21:48.570, Speaker A: COVID. Let's see how I can close this. I can close this. Let's maintain this pin. I can see the transaction hash. Not yet. In a few minutes we will have the transaction hash.
00:21:48.570 - 00:22:29.880, Speaker A: Let's wait. I don't have my yet. Probably this transaction is going to the main pool. And what is this? What's happening now? Why I'm waiting. When we send the transaction to the blockchain, the transaction go to a place, it's like a waiting area. And then it's waiting the miners to get the transactions and add in the blockchain. And we are waiting for this now.
00:22:29.880 - 00:23:11.000, Speaker A: Maybe we have some problems, because if we are like 100 of us now doing this at the same time, maybe not working. And you can change to another wallet that I already have submitted. And yes, for Maria. Maria, you need to select the testnet in your wallet. Okay, here you have the configuration to select the testnet. Because I already did this. I cannot do it again.
00:23:11.000 - 00:23:54.890, Speaker A: I change my wallet to be fast with you because we don't have so much time to wait here. Wait a minute. I'm getting another wallet and I change my wallet in the other window. Because we are still waiting the confirmation the transaction. Probably you too. Great. Oh, I like the numbers.
00:23:54.890 - 00:24:21.210, Speaker A: I like this. Who has exit. Don't often put your name here. Like him. Yes. Okay. Only to understand how many of you are good.
00:24:21.210 - 00:24:52.412, Speaker A: And remember that I told you that. Yes, great. I couldn't get it yet. I need to change my wallet. This is interesting to show you. Yes, let's do it. Think that you don't know your password anymore or you'd like to change your wallet.
00:24:52.412 - 00:25:38.820, Speaker A: How will you do this? I will click on forget password and then remember that twelve words that you saved. You need them now. I paste my words, but I'm using another wallet now create a new password again. And this is. I have any wallet that I know that I have eaten some COVID. Great. For the people who doesn't have COVID.
00:25:38.820 - 00:26:08.304, Speaker A: Put your name and someone please help these guys. Like I don't need more. But maybe someone couldn't get the data. So go here. The best way to get it. Yeah, you can see that here I have some. Great.
00:26:08.304 - 00:26:36.730, Speaker A: Let's go. We already get a lot of time with the wallet. Spark. Let's go to remix now. When I go into remix, I have two options. In the classes, I use the remix non secure. But if you're doing some interesting project, it's better to use the security.
00:26:36.730 - 00:27:09.248, Speaker A: Okay, let's go to remix now. I already have the remix opened here. Go to any of this. And the other guys that already have. Please help these guys. Someone could send a bit for them and you can put. Okay, here, like, are you sent to Dominic? Okay, so this is me.
00:27:09.248 - 00:27:48.010, Speaker A: Are you helping this guy? How are you doing? Let's understand how to send it. I came here in my metamask. Send paste the address. And I sent zero point. A small portion, but it's good to be honest. So you can see here that I'm sending. I'm awaiting the transaction too.
00:27:48.010 - 00:28:29.774, Speaker A: Maybe we lock our network in a few minutes. Dominique, you receive date, okay? Yes, probably now you can see that it was sending so by me I can put this. Okay. And please help our friends, your colleagues that need it too. Okay. And let's come back to remix. This is remix.
00:28:29.774 - 00:29:00.602, Speaker A: I really love to use remix and remix. It's so useful. Remix. It's so useful to do with mouth apps and to learn. Especially because you don't need to install nothing in your. Wow. I may try to solve with the chat, but it's hard.
00:29:00.602 - 00:29:17.818, Speaker A: Guys. Yes. The pad disappeared again. I copied the pad. Okay. And let's come back. Unimix is so important for us.
00:29:17.818 - 00:29:58.670, Speaker A: Especially when you are a beginner, especially when you are learning. Because you don't need to install nothing in your computer. You only need to have a browser open like we have now and a wallet that we will connect. Let's do this. The goal here is to create your first smart contract. Our first smart contract u colored register is this. I paste this code on pet and then you copy and paste in your own remix.
00:29:58.670 - 00:30:33.080, Speaker A: How you can create this? Go here we have the default workspace. Up it down. You have the create a new file and create the hedgeste Sol. Can you use Ganache? Ganache is another simulator of blockchain and ganache. You install it in your computer. Yes, you can use it. But now our goal is to do this online.
00:30:33.080 - 00:31:13.828, Speaker A: So we don't have nothing installed in our computer. Okay. Create a new file register and the file will be this. Between the begin and the end, you will copy. What are you put here now this is the file. Copy and paste. Don't cut.
00:31:13.828 - 00:31:58.560, Speaker A: Please try to only copy because we have a lot of people trying to do this at the same time. Good luck for us. Now I hope to you that you can copy and paste and you get this here in a notepad to be sure that we don't have problems. And probably you could do this now and you have something like this. It's good. I think the font size. It's okay.
00:31:58.560 - 00:32:54.078, Speaker A: What I have here, usually when we create our first match content in the first line we add the license identifier, what kind of license you are using. So I'm using kind of open slices. This is the MIT. After this I need to define the version of the compiler that I like to use. I'm using the to do this, I use this word, this comma pragma solidity. We are using the solidity language in the version 0.8.7. Then I need to create this much content, the word user to create your content, to define everything inside your content.
00:32:54.078 - 00:33:25.418, Speaker A: It's the word content. Everything that it's inside is much content. Here is the name of the smart context. Hash one and between the g's we have our smart context. I always forget the name of this. I will remember inside my smart contract what I have. Let's see if it oh, it's here.
00:33:25.418 - 00:33:53.838, Speaker A: Oh, I'm so happy that it's here. Let's come back. Our ismatch content has a variable colored info. Just variable curly brackets. Yes. Thank you so much. So our smart context is inside the curly brackets and the name of my variable is info.
00:33:53.838 - 00:34:37.040, Speaker A: It's a string. The type is a string. It means that I can put almost anything inside the variable, and this is a private variable. Private means that it can be used only inside the smart context. Can I see what is inside this variable? Not telling, calling directly this, but when you are saving some information here, you can see. So be careful. Be private doesn't means that you cannot see what's inside.
00:34:37.040 - 00:35:25.786, Speaker A: It means that you can access this inside. But when you are sending some information, saving some information, you can see too. After this I create a function, call it getinfo. Getinfo is exactly to show you what is inside the variable. So my function is publicly. Anyone can call this function. It's a view because I'm not changing nothing, I'm only showing something that it's inside this much content and it's returning the content of the variable info in memory.
00:35:25.786 - 00:36:12.110, Speaker A: Okay, after this we have another function called set info. Set info is used to save the information inside that variable. I'm sending a parameter here, the info with the sign this is public. Anyone can use this in the same way. And you can see that I am storing this info inside this, it's only this. So this is our first smart component. It's very simple, but it's important to be in this way to be easy to everyone deploy.
00:36:12.110 - 00:36:40.840, Speaker A: Let's see. Oh I'm so happy that it's still here. You cannot imagine. After we have our match content here, the next step is to compile it. Let's expand this part again. I'm going now to the third icon or second button. No, this is new here.
00:36:40.840 - 00:38:02.930, Speaker A: Okay, now the fourth icon here, the solid compiler. I used to have the output compiler selected so you can see that here I have a green sign because my content is a red compiler. And what happened if I do something wrong? Like you put this here, what do you have? Oh, now it's not a ring sign anymore. I have an echo over there because I have the out compiler selected. Anytime that I change something the remix is compiling again and it's telling me if it's right or it's wrong about the question related to when I need to use the memory. We use the memory when the parameter is not saving on the blockchain. So we sending this to the memory of the node, to the memory in fact of the transaction or this will going not be saved in the blockchain in the state of the blockchain.
00:38:02.930 - 00:39:13.984, Speaker A: And because of this it's memory here and we have the memory here. Let's come back probably now you have the auto compile here. If you didn't do you can compilehester next step, let's go to the now it's the fifth button or yes, 50 icon for button deploy and road transactions. You can see here that I have the environment JavaScript here. I need to change this environment because I'd like to publish our content directly in a real blockchain. But if you'd like to do some tests before you can use this. This is a simulator of a blockchain inside the browser, in the memory of the browser and it's useful sometimes to do tests to test some small logics.
00:39:13.984 - 00:40:01.640, Speaker A: So you can do this. Not for us. Now we'd like to use the injected webitree. It means that I'm connecting the remix with the wallet in my browser, that it's metamask injected WeBitree just now. And I have the same problem that I had with the faucet because I had the remix opened before and I installed my wallet. I need to reload the remix. Here we are, I am here again.
00:40:01.640 - 00:40:50.246, Speaker A: This is our register. Let's go to the deploying transactions. And now probably you work injected web three. Why not? So let's see my work. Yes, I need to wait a bit. Yes, my wallet is okay. And you can see here that I have the injected web three here probably for you.
00:40:50.246 - 00:41:34.554, Speaker A: When you are doing this the first time, the metamask you open for you and you need to connect with Metamask. So I need to select this next and then connect. Now my wallet is connected with remix and I can sign my transactions in remix using my metamask wallet. You also can see here that this is my wallet. It's a 52. Let's go here. But it's a 52 believe on me.
00:41:34.554 - 00:41:57.982, Speaker A: And this is my balance. 2.75. 2.75. So it's my wallet. You can go scroll down a bit and see the complex here, because we only have you one complex. We don't have nothing to choose. But be careful.
00:41:57.982 - 00:42:26.790, Speaker A: Sometimes we have a lot of complex and you need to choose the right contact to deploy. Let's see the chat if you need some help. Oh, thank you for the responses, Samit. Wait. Thanks so much guys, in helping me. Okay, this is really awesome. Let's come back and deploy our smart contract.
00:42:26.790 - 00:43:41.714, Speaker A: Are you clicking the button deploy just now and you can see that when I clicking the button deploy metamask will open a new pop up window and I need to confirm these transactions. This transaction. It means that remix is sending a transaction to the blockchain using metamask. And I'm signing this transaction. I'm approving this transaction in metamask just now. And yes, Paul, every time that a function return a string, you must define that this is a memory for the parameters and for the returns for the interactions with the function in the input or output. And the transaction is much concepts are already deployed.
00:43:41.714 - 00:44:30.166, Speaker A: How can I see this? Let's try to expand this part. Remix usually has this left path that we put comments and interact with the content we have. In the right part above date smart context, and in the right path below we have like a console and we can see what happened. And now you can see here that I have a green sign here because my smartphone is already deployed. I can see the transaction I can see on nether scan. I can see everything I will not see. Now I will come back to the left side and scroll down a bit more.
00:44:30.166 - 00:44:57.902, Speaker A: And we are going to deploy it. Contacts here. In deployed contacts I can expand the register one. This is the address of my mat contact. And I have two buttons over there. What is you can see get info is the function get info settings. The bottom setting is the bottom setting for over there.
00:44:57.902 - 00:45:29.030, Speaker A: So it works great. Let's click on get info. Do you have some information here? No, nothing. And why not? Because we don't define any information when we create our smart contract. Let's save some information. Now I put my name. I put so and click you feel the information in the right side of the bottom and click on settings.
00:45:29.030 - 00:46:03.668, Speaker A: Now I'm sending another transaction to the blockchain. Wait a minute. To metamask confirm a transaction. I don't know why it's so slow today. Yes, confirming the transaction. Let's see, the pad is here. Let's do something.
00:46:03.668 - 00:46:43.472, Speaker A: Now add your naming and register address. Let's interact with the smart contract after this. So my history is this. I can copy the address in the right side of the name and the UIPC here you can do the same. And microsection is already confirmed. So if I go to get info just now you can see that my name. I know that this is mouth.
00:46:43.472 - 00:47:18.690, Speaker A: I don't know how to exactly this part so big but you can see my name is here. Yeah, I can put any information in my smart contract. And now I'd like to see Dave's match content. Dave, I see your smart content now. Let's do it. I'm copying the address of Dave's smart content and I already have the search code. We are using exactly the same search code.
00:47:18.690 - 00:48:06.960, Speaker A: So I will use this button at address paste the address of Dave smartphone and click at the bottom at the address. And what is the information that Dave saved in your content? In his content? His name. Great. Let's put the chain link over there. And what I'm doing just now I am interacting with another smart contract. Remember that we are in a network. We are in a blockchain network.
00:48:06.960 - 00:48:58.530, Speaker A: So I can use as much content deployed by another person. And this is. Let's see the information now. Hey Daisy, could you see if for you appear the chain link hack because I just changed your how is possible we can interact with any smart content that are deployed on the blockchain. And if you don't like you would not like to someone to interact with your as much content. You need to create as much content a bit more complex with some kind of access control. This is the next step.
00:48:58.530 - 00:50:03.060, Speaker A: I have only ten minutes. We have some crazy here. What happened to the previous screen? I like this question. The previous screen is saved in the transaction that we did. But now it was not there anymore because we saved another information in the same place. So we lost the private screen, something like that, but we have it in a transaction, like if I see all the transactions from that smart contract, I can see. Let's go to COVID risk and understand what happened, because I changed the day smart contract, I will see his contact, not mine.
00:50:03.060 - 00:51:37.620, Speaker A: And you can see here that we have some interactions with this mat someone create and then we have three interactions, probably another person already changes again, let's see. No, it's good, but I can see that we have three information and probably if I see this transaction because we don't, I cannot see everything now, but I can see that. Explain this now because each of these. Yes, this is what I'm looking for, each of these, it's a setting full, we can see that the setting function was colored three times and let's see one of this, like I can see this, I'm looking to see more. Yes, here I can see the setting for function colored and this was the parameters. If I try to see this like normal characters, we can see that we have the day here. If I try to see like another transaction, probably let's try another.
00:51:37.620 - 00:53:24.822, Speaker A: Yes, you can see this transaction and decoding, this was the chain link hack, so I have each transaction saying what was saved in that variable before and we can track this, we can audit, we can have all the historical data of this. So to finish it just now, let's create another smart contextuality register five, this is five because I have the others that is not going to show you here. And what we have here's I put the search code for you, this is let's copy and paste, be careful to not cut, careful to maintain this for outer guys. And let's close G's and G's and G's, yes, and come back to remix. This is the order is much content that we are seeing now, what's the difference in this is much content? First my info. Agora is not only one information, I have an array of information, so I can have 12345 information. Also I have owner.
00:53:24.822 - 00:54:44.340, Speaker A: What's owner? This owner, it's another type of information, it's called address, it's here to store the address of the person who is creating this smart home page. This is our goal. And also I have a mapping, a mapping, it's a key value structure. So for each address I can have a true or false and this is telling if I can save or not information here because I call it this whitelist in the constructor. Wow, what's the constructor? The constructor, it's a new function that we are seeing now and this function is colored only once, only when the smart context is created. And here I am saving the address of the person who is sending the transaction to create the smart contract in the owner and also saying that this person, this address is in the white rich. So it will be possible to change the information.
00:54:44.340 - 00:55:34.302, Speaker A: Then I have a new kind of structure here, the event. Every time you can emit event to tell the world that something is changing. In this case I'm creating an event called info change with the old information and the new information. Also I'd like to introduce for you the modifier. What's the modifier? Modifiers can be used in the function to do something in the function. You are adding some functionality or some requirement in your function. I have two modifiers.
00:55:34.302 - 00:56:30.360, Speaker A: One that is checking that only the owner, only the person who create the smart context can couches, and another that is checking if the color is in the white list. After all of this, let's use the modifiers here. I'm using the only whitelist. The adding foo is to add a new information in our array. It's adding a new position in our array with the information that we are sending. Only who are in the whitelist can do this. In the same way I have the set info, set info now it's used to update information in a position.
00:56:30.360 - 00:57:45.214, Speaker A: I need to already save some information over there and then I can call the setting info and inform the new information and the position, the index and then change this information update. I have another function here called listinfo and this will return all the positions of my array. Remember that now only the people that are in the white list can change the information, can add or use the set info. So I need to have two functions. New one for add members, another for delete members in the whitelist. Only owner can do this. So is this great question Paul, why I have this here? This means that after check this, after execute this lining, it's supposed to continue what we have in this match content.
00:57:45.214 - 00:58:24.860, Speaker A: So use the only whitelist. Here is the same. If I put here this and don't use the only whitelist, this is exactly the same. But it will be more clear if I use the whitelist and I can use this. You can see that I use the same here and here and it's better to understand what's happened. So with this, JP is to continue executing the code of the function. This is perfect.
00:58:24.860 - 00:59:13.010, Speaker A: Let's deploy this. We have two minutes to do this. I came here now to deploy in the run transaction, deploy register five and confirm. Just now and in 1 minute we can see another deployed contract over there. Yes, let's go here and. Wow, I have a lot of information now. What happened? No information now the owner is me.
00:59:13.010 - 00:59:47.756, Speaker A: I am in the whitelist. Yes, let's add a new information. Hack on only hack admiral. Let's click on confirm and you can see that we have information here. I ask you, let's do the same. Name it and hashtag address. I love this.
00:59:47.756 - 01:00:13.030, Speaker A: Will you help me? Thank you so much. This is my address. Let's do this. And maybe we can check later the smart context of the others. And now I have one information here. Haps, are you doing more? It's supposed to. Not because we are on time, but chain link.
01:00:13.030 - 01:00:52.920, Speaker A: I mean adding a new information. Yes, we can see that it's a middleware. No, it's injected in your service code for black code. So I did another transaction. Now you can see that in list info. I have the hack, the chain link. If I check the position zero, I have only the hack.
01:00:52.920 - 01:01:41.472, Speaker A: In the position one, I have only the chain link. So is this for now? I'd like to be with you more time. The next time I try to do this longer to be with you more time. But I know that we are 1 hour here and I know that the time is over. So tomorrow I will teach you a bit more about truffle. Truffle is one of the environments that we can use to deploy smart context in our computer. We need to install truffle and we are doing this tomorrow and hope to see you.
01:01:41.472 - 01:02:02.260, Speaker A: I know that the beginning it was a bit crazy, but now it was good. And hope to see you tomorrow. And we have more workshops now Zach is starting one related to what's Chainlink? And how about the Chainlink products? See you over there guys. Bye.
