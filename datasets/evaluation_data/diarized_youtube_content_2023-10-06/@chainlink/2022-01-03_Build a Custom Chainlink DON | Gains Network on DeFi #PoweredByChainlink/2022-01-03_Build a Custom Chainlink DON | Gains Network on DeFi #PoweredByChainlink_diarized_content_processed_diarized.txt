00:00:00.970 - 00:00:09.630, Speaker A: Happy new year. We're back. We're live on YouTube. Hey, everybody, it's me. I'm Andy from Chainlink Labs. I've got Zach with me down below. Sorry that way.
00:00:09.630 - 00:00:27.606, Speaker A: And I've got with me from Gains Network and we're going to hang out for a few minutes and get settled. I see there's a ton of people who are watching and that's awesome. You are all welcome. Thank you for being here, welcoming us back to this new year. We're going to learn a lot about Gaines Network today and lot about chain link dawns and how to set yours up.
00:00:27.708 - 00:00:29.442, Speaker B: Set up going on here in the background.
00:00:29.506 - 00:00:33.366, Speaker A: You look trimmed. Did you get like a hookup and everything? You're like good.
00:00:33.468 - 00:00:40.620, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I got a little haircut going on. I don't have a wild, like crazy Einstein hair going on right now.
00:00:41.550 - 00:01:09.042, Speaker A: That'll be March, right? Just the end of the quarter. I see a ton of people in here. Hey, everybody, we see your comments in the chat, if you have. Yeah, I see Seb, what a legend crypto wanderer knows. We're going to get into it and learn a lot about Gains network, what they do, what they're about. And of course, kind of the headline story to me is Seb built his own hybrid custom chainlink decentralized Oracle network, which is one of these really cool pieces of functionality. So we're going to talk about that.
00:01:09.042 - 00:01:37.334, Speaker A: Zach's got a bunch of questions, so let's get started here. Chainlink live DfI powered by chain link. Hey, everybody, welcome back to the new year. Our first episode of Chainlink Live for 2022. I've got Seb from Gains Network here. Down below is Zach from the chain link Labs developer relations team. But first we're going to learn a little bit about what is gains network.
00:01:37.334 - 00:01:40.640, Speaker A: Seb, can you tell us what is gains about what makes it special?
00:01:41.730 - 00:02:12.870, Speaker C: So really gains network is a suit of defi projects building on Polygon. And our first project is Gtrade. So it's a decentralized leverage trading platform. Quick summary, we allow up to 150 x leverage. So it's a really unique selling point in the industry. And we have 43 cryptocurrencies listed and even ten forex pairs. So that's for a quick summary.
00:02:13.210 - 00:02:42.942, Speaker A: Awesome. Now, I said this before the little drop before the intro is you guys created your own Chainlink decentralized Oracle network. When Don's kind of the announcement for Don's came out last year. This is what I was really excited about is talking about, well, Chainlink isn't just price feeds, Chainlink isn't just VRF. Chainlink is a protocol. It's a way to build your own things there. So can you talk a little bit about why did you make this choice to build your own, to kind of build this? It's a hybrid model.
00:02:42.942 - 00:02:44.900, Speaker A: Can you talk a little bit about that as well?
00:02:45.270 - 00:04:06.058, Speaker C: So really the goal was to allow a very high amount of leverage and for this we needed really accurate price feeds like that update every second or so. And the problem with the default price feeds is they are not meant to be updated every second or they are made to be accurate for lensing platforms and such, but for very high leverage. They are not designed for that use case. So that's why we invented, maybe it has been done before but I think we are the first product to do it on main net. So that's why we invented the on demand chain link done. So basically when a trade happens on the platform, a request is made to our nodes, to our chain link node which listen to the blockchain for this event and then they will send the median price from seven exchange back to the blockchain to our own aggregator contract which will then take again the median. So it really takes the median two times.
00:04:06.058 - 00:04:30.130, Speaker C: So there is no single point of failure, not from the API side and not from the node side and then it can just trigger the trading order at the real time price that live was just fetched. So it's connected directly to the exchange so it's updated every second like it's pretty much real time.
00:04:30.280 - 00:04:57.114, Speaker A: Cool. Zach, why don't you jump in? You has a little more like technically minded questions and I want to remind the audience, if you're just joining us, hi, I'm Andy from Chainlink Labs. This is Seb. Nope, wrong way. Seb from Gaines network. I'm sorry, you guys did a rebrand and if you have questions about how he set up their hybrid chainlink, decentralized oracle network or dawn, feel free to drop them in. Or if you have questions about the protocol and how it works and things like that, feel free to drop them.
00:04:57.114 - 00:05:00.026, Speaker A: But Zach, I'm going to turn it over to you for a. Yeah, yeah.
00:05:00.048 - 00:05:17.166, Speaker B: I appreciate that Andy. You got a lot of juicy technical questions to ask here. First of all, kind of on the broad look at the don, how did you find, how much time and effort did you need to put in into building your own decentralized oracle network? I'm sure it wasn't trivial.
00:05:17.358 - 00:06:00.378, Speaker C: So there is really two aspects that require a lot of work. It was first finding a good team of chainlink node operators because I had to recruit them and work with them and build a trust relationship. And this is really cutting edge stuff. So it really requires really skilled chain link node operators. So it was pretty hard to find them. That's the first part is recruiting the chain link node operators. And then there is also finding the right APIs for setting the on demand price feeds.
00:06:00.378 - 00:06:42.170, Speaker C: So currently we have cryptocurrencies. This one are connected directly to seven top volume exchange like binance, Coinbase, et cetera. And we have also forex, which was kind of a challenge because forex data is obviously not as access, it's not easy to access as crypto data. So we had to pay APIs and find really good ones. Really, it was these two parts.
00:06:42.670 - 00:06:50.334, Speaker B: So when selecting those chain link nodes, how did you go about that? What was the process you went to for?
00:06:50.372 - 00:07:04.850, Speaker A: Let me come back to that in one sec, Zach. Okay. Because I do want to get to that question, but I want to show people real quick. Do you guys have my. Yeah, here we go. So this is data chain link. You can go and look at the chainlink price feeds oracles.
00:07:04.850 - 00:07:23.718, Speaker A: This is chainlink price feeds. This is kind of like the basic chainlink product, like Chainlink solution. This is a price feed. It shows the price of Ethereum USD. And this is on Ethereum, not polygon right now. But each of these oracles, they make up a Chainlink decentralized Oracle network. This is a chainlink dawn.
00:07:23.718 - 00:07:51.586, Speaker A: All of them are going and getting data and they're bringing it back. They're creating an aggregate and they're submitting it on chain. Chainlink price feeds is like this kind of a solution for anybody. You can go in and you can tap into it. What Seb is talking about for games network is it didn't update fast enough for their needs and so they built their own where they went and used, set their own parameters and they got their own different nodes in here to work together at a different clock speed, basically.
00:07:51.688 - 00:08:29.614, Speaker C: And really it was because the use case is different. It's not because chain link price feeds are bad. Of course not, but it's because the design for these feeds was meant for lending platforms and such, and they are meant to be accessible at any time and they have a very slight delay, but that's not a problem. But if we wanted a price feed updated every second, it will spend so much gas for nothing because most of the time it doesn't need to access the price. It only needs the price when there is a trade. So it's just another design.
00:08:29.812 - 00:08:38.286, Speaker A: Yeah. So over here, this deviation threshold that's on the Eth USD, it's set at 0.5%. And so every time the price changes that much there's an automatic update.
00:08:38.318 - 00:08:39.006, Speaker B: It calls.
00:08:39.118 - 00:08:53.560, Speaker A: But that's a configurable parameter in a custom dot and on polygon that gets much lower. Right. You can trigger it when there's a lower deviation and when you have a custom dot you can make it even lower or a time frame lower. You can do all this.
00:08:55.290 - 00:09:26.210, Speaker C: It's really a different architecture because the chain link feeds, they use OCR so it's basically not communicate between each other off chain and they take the median and they only send one answer on chain and that's really how the feeds work. But what we run is just on demand requests that are aggregated in a custom aggregator contract.
00:09:29.350 - 00:09:42.294, Speaker A: I'm just showing a couple of other examples so people kind of see and I want to encourage audience, go check out this data chain link. Once you kind of click through and see it, you understand how they work and can start thinking of those parameters there.
00:09:42.492 - 00:10:18.660, Speaker C: But really the cool thing that almost nobody knows for some reason is that Chainlink is like a technical solution to listen for events on the blockchain and then send a price or really any data. It's not just the price feeds, but the price feeds is one use case of this technology. And really we leverage this technology by doing another use case. So that shows it's not just the chain link fees really it's more than that.
00:10:19.990 - 00:10:43.338, Speaker A: The comments are all like praising Seb. They think you're amazing, which it's clear you are. You've got a handle on this. I see you all in there and there's a couple of great questions soon I think your name is. We'll get to your question especially a little bit later. So if you're making your own custom chain link, dawn, there's a little extra work that goes into it. Zach, you were just asking a question about something.
00:10:43.338 - 00:10:44.860, Speaker A: Can you head back to that?
00:10:45.390 - 00:11:10.690, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. So I think that was a great explanation on the Chainlink data feeds, Andy. And so as you see, there's all these oracles on this like CAD USD that I've been selecting. These are some of the top node operators in the industry. And I'm curious what process you went through in games to find some of your own node operators.
00:11:12.230 - 00:11:55.040, Speaker C: Well, I recruited most of them on the chainlink discord and we worked together for a few months. We did a lot of tests, really, the process took like three, four months to get all the parameters right. So it's really a lot of work. And I could see which nodes were willing to work with us and had the right skills and which nodes didn't fit. Really only the best nodes stayed. It was like they were selected. It was a natural process, really.
00:11:56.690 - 00:11:57.534, Speaker B: That's awesome.
00:11:57.652 - 00:12:04.130, Speaker A: Zach, do you have any other tips? Like how would you go about looking for others? I mean, chain link discord, go there. That's awesome place. I love that.
00:12:04.200 - 00:12:29.420, Speaker B: But are there other know market link I think is a great place to find nodes. It's a whole marketplace for nodes and external adapters, which are ways nodes can connect to outside data resources. So that's a good place to find some active nodes, see their reputation, see what they've done in the past, and kind of see what's going on there.
00:12:30.030 - 00:12:54.510, Speaker A: Pop that open so people can kind of check that out too. And then, oh yeah, nodes. This file up here, you can kind of go and see what people are doing. Link pool, I know them, so you can kind of go the different kind of things that they do. A lot of information there. I also think. Is there reputation link? Do people use that, Zach?
00:12:54.670 - 00:13:01.782, Speaker B: Yeah, reputation link is another source that you can go to and you can see all these live. They have a really cool dashboard I like.
00:13:01.836 - 00:13:07.526, Speaker A: All right, I'll pull that one up too. You ask your next question. I'm going to pull up reputation link as well.
00:13:07.708 - 00:13:24.350, Speaker B: Yeah, next question was. So you were talking about the skills node operators. You were looking for specific skills node operators needed to join your oracle network. What specific skills were you looking for in your nodes?
00:13:25.570 - 00:14:27.598, Speaker C: I think really the most important, well, it's not really a skill, but it's being available like almost twenty four seven to monitor the setup and see if there is a problem because it requires a lot of monitoring. And really a key thing in these chain link nodes is the connection to the blockchain to see if there are requests. So for example, a chain link node to know if there is a trade executed or that needs to be executed. Basically there is an event triggered in the smart contract. And the role of the chain link node is to listen to this event. And to do that it needs a connection to the blockchain. So it needs to be connected to a matic node since we are on polygon node, since we are a polygon.
00:14:27.598 - 00:15:08.686, Speaker C: And this is a really delicate part because polygon node can sometimes go out of sync. So since it's a very heavy software, it can sometimes go down. It needs monitoring and everything. So that's why we made a setup where we have an automatic switch and we have a pool of matic nodes really to select, always the best one. So that part required some time. And really that's the most delicate part. That's the connection to the blockchain that needs to be live all the time.
00:15:08.686 - 00:15:16.598, Speaker C: If there is a problem with this, it can see the request coming and it will miss some calls.
00:15:16.794 - 00:15:20.690, Speaker A: Interesting. We have a whole bunch of people that have joined us since we did the intro.
00:15:20.760 - 00:15:20.946, Speaker C: So.
00:15:20.968 - 00:15:47.606, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, welcome to Chainlink Live. I'm Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. Zach from Chainlink Labs is with me below. I cannot get my pointing right. And Seb from Gains Network is here to talk to us about Gains network and what they're doing. We've kind of gotten into what is gains. First of all, it's this hyper leverageable platform on Polygon network that has created its own custom chain link, Don decentralized Oracle network.
00:15:47.606 - 00:16:17.460, Speaker A: And so we took a look at Don's, kind of went through their construction, and then what Seb did that's a little bit different to make his own and why as well. So, awesome conversation so far. There's been a couple of good questions so far. Anna, I'm going to get to yours at the end. As to Zach, I'm going to let you address this question. It's a question from our audience. What's the difference between a simple chainlink node and a dawn, a decentralized oracle network? Can you phrase that for soon?
00:16:17.830 - 00:16:23.746, Speaker B: Yeah. So at a high level, I would say the difference is a chainlink node is just a single individual node.
00:16:23.778 - 00:16:23.974, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:24.012 - 00:16:44.634, Speaker B: And a dawn is a decentralized oracle network. So it's a bunch of nodes that communicate with each other to aggregate data off chain and put that aggregate data on chain. It's far more decentralized, a far more robust solution than just using an individual centralized node because of course this is blockchain.
00:16:44.762 - 00:17:28.694, Speaker A: We want decentralization, decentralization for oracles. If you want the price of Ethereum, for example, and you're trading on 150 x leverage on gains network, you want to make sure you get the right price. And if so, you're getting that price from one exchange. Somebody can manipulate that exchange. You can tank the price from one exchange with a flash loan relatively easily. Like I could do it, and I'm not technical, because you just need to be able to take out a loan, have enough collateral, and you can really adjust the price and affect your leverage position that may be on another network. So that's the main value proposition of decentralized oracles is you get the price from multiple different nodes who are getting it from hundreds of different exchanges aggregated so that that price is really stable.
00:17:28.694 - 00:17:45.220, Speaker A: If one exchange has a weird price, it gets aggregated out. It's how math works, right? It's just averaged in and they're medianized actually in this case. So that's kind of the difference is a single oracle versus multiple oracles working together to deliver a particular value.
00:17:45.670 - 00:17:56.120, Speaker C: And by the way, just about price, I think there is a really interesting point. We really are the only leverage trading platform to offer spot price.
00:17:56.810 - 00:17:57.670, Speaker A: Spot.
00:17:58.090 - 00:18:44.670, Speaker C: Yeah. So because we are a synthetic platform, we get to use any price feed, really any API that we want. And so we found it better to use spot because it better reflects the true price of an asset. Because other platforms, they really are derivatives contract. So they use derivative contract, which don't really, I mean, they are meant to track the price of the underlying asset, but you don't really trade the price of the asset. You trade the contract, which is supposed to follow the price, but it's still not the same. And really on gains or trade, you trade the true spot price of the asset because it's even medianized from seven exchange.
00:18:44.670 - 00:19:18.254, Speaker C: So it's not even the spot price from a single exchange, but really a median which is really effective to filter out like bad volatility when there is a big week on a single exchange. For example, if there is a lot of volatility to the downside, like a big dump on the whole market, some exchange tend to go crazy, like there are big weeks that liquidate a lot of people. And this way we get to filter this out. And it's been really effective so far.
00:19:18.372 - 00:19:59.658, Speaker A: I've talked to a couple of data providers. They collect data from exchanges and they've talked a little bit about why do different exchanges have different rates besides the tax? Well, think about promotions. Think about an exchange pops up and they have a new promotion for this month and they're going to offer whatever it is and $10 per $100 you trade or whatever it happens to be. Well, all of a sudden that exchange's volume can go up dramatically because people just move to that exchange to take advantage of the promotion. Well, then the price is different because there's more activity on this one and less on this one. And so there's all these different things that can happen in the actual spot price across exchanges that make that price a little bit different. And if it's a little bit different and we can go see.
00:19:59.658 - 00:20:23.042, Speaker A: Let me pop this up again. You can go and see how these places are getting slightly different prices here. Let's do eth USD again. Right. Node here is getting 3802 for price of ethereum chain analysis. I think it is. Oh no, that's alpha chain 37, 95.
00:20:23.042 - 00:20:29.880, Speaker A: They have slightly different numbers because different markets trade at different rates. And so getting the best one you can, that's important.
00:20:30.490 - 00:21:23.320, Speaker C: Yeah, really, the price is different on different exchanges because they are all like a marketplace to, let's say, buy bitcoin. So there is some demand and there is some offers, and, you know, it works with order books. And since they all have their own order books, the price can be exactly the same because there are always like different buyers and sellers. And so they stay pretty much the same across all exchange because there are arbitragers that can simply, if BTC is cheaper on an exchange, you can buy on one exchange and sell on the other. So they tend to stay pretty close, but they won't be always the same because really there is not the same activity on every platform.
00:21:25.050 - 00:21:33.580, Speaker A: Zach, do you have some more questions for the developer minded folks who are really watching to see how do I do this myself? What are some other things that you might think of?
00:21:34.270 - 00:22:05.460, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I actually have a question on kind of the architecture of gains network, since we're kind of on that subject, more on the technical side of that. So you're saying you guys use the spot price, which is what kind of differentiates you from other leveraged trading platforms in the past, what was the core innovations in your product that allow you to do this? And how did you come across this idea when you were creating this awesome application?
00:22:06.810 - 00:23:07.710, Speaker C: So really what allows us to use spot prices is the fact that we're a synthetics platform. So we don't have order books for each pair listed on our platform, we don't generate our own price. And as I said, it's because we're a synthetics, but how can we be a synthetics platform? It's because the core innovation behind it is minting and burning our GNS token to handle traders profits or losses. So when a trader wins, so it's really simplified. There are a lot of layers to that. But if I simplify that, really, if a trader wins, it will mint some tokens, some of our GNS tokens, and if a trader loses, it will burn the tokens. And, you know, since it tends to have a little more loser long term than winners.
00:23:07.710 - 00:23:27.600, Speaker C: It even created a slight deflation on the GNS supply until now. So relates the core innovation, paying profits by minting tokens and handling losses by burning tokens to create really a sustainable design.
00:23:31.010 - 00:23:51.560, Speaker B: That's a very fascinating design methodology. It's very different because I feel like the natural tendency is to take how these things work currently in CFI and take that with the order book model. And this is pretty clever way to do that in the decentralized sense.
00:23:53.690 - 00:24:52.220, Speaker C: So religion is used to if you want to simulate the trading PNL of all trades on any pair at any leverage. So let's say you open like 50 x trade on bitcoin, then you won some money. Let's say you won $100. As I said, it's a bit more complicated than that, but it would mint $100 worth of GNS. And if you lost $100, it will just burn this amount of GNS. And so really, since traders on our platform interact using DAi, that's why we need the GNS DAi pool. And we have it on quickswap currently this way, because before the traders used to trade directly with GNS, and now we offer trading with Dai because it's a better user experience.
00:24:52.220 - 00:25:43.180, Speaker C: Because before traders had to bury our token to trade, so we had to invent another innovation to allow dai trading, which is our DAi vault. So really, when you open a trade on our platform, the die from your trade goes to our divault. So let's say you open the $100 trade regardless of the leverage, by the way, only the collateral goes to the liquidity. The 100 die will go to our die vault. And then if you close the trade, the collateral plus the profits or loss will come out of this vault. So it's basically just a die liquidity only. Currently we have about 2 million in that.
00:25:43.180 - 00:26:23.640, Speaker C: And if it goes below its initial balance, so below 2 million, it can be refilled by minting and selling gns in very small amounts over time to spread the selling pressure if we need to refill the vault, and if we go above a certain threshold. So currently it's 10% above the initial balance. So we have some extra die to pay wins. If there are a lot of wins, it will buy and burn GNS on the market over time using the excess of die. So that's how we have implemented it.
00:26:24.730 - 00:26:32.060, Speaker B: That's really cool. So it's like your counterparty here is the GNS token itself.
00:26:32.590 - 00:26:36.060, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's the dai vault, which is backed by the.
00:26:40.030 - 00:27:16.840, Speaker B: You know. Now, taking that back to the dawn that you've built. So every time a trade is opened or closed, a request is sent to a chain link don, your custom don correct to get that price. So when you do that, you have to send link tokens to the chainlink nodes to incentivize them to do their work. How have you kind of tackled this issue of making sure that the chain nodes always have link tokens to fund their work?
00:27:17.210 - 00:27:46.462, Speaker C: Yeah. So we take a small fee on every trade and a portion of that fee goes to our chain link nodes. So they are incentivized to. So first it pays the gas cost of course, because it's very small, but it's still there. And they of course make a profit in the end. This way they are incentivized. So really our chain link done is totally sustainable and profitable for our nodes.
00:27:46.606 - 00:27:48.398, Speaker B: That is fantastic.
00:27:48.574 - 00:27:50.674, Speaker A: It is profitable, yeah.
00:27:50.792 - 00:28:01.190, Speaker C: So currently for our eight nodes, we have eight nodes. Currently they earn a total of 35,000 per month average.
00:28:01.770 - 00:28:02.374, Speaker A: Wow.
00:28:02.492 - 00:28:03.160, Speaker B: Okay.
00:28:03.610 - 00:28:09.720, Speaker A: This is an untold story in the chain link ecosystem. I'm going to get, that's amazing.
00:28:10.030 - 00:28:14.620, Speaker C: About 4000 per month each, which is pretty cool.
00:28:15.070 - 00:28:53.426, Speaker A: That's really cool. So for people who are just joining us or who don't know why, I suddenly got excited. Right. Chainlink nodes, each of these oracles, they get paid in link to go get data and to bring it and submit it onto the network and make sure all the technology is working correctly and make sure it's submitted in the correct way and everything's accurate. They get paid in the link token. That's the purpose of the link token is to pay node operators for their participation in the network. And so to have them be doing that at a volume enough to be profitable for this is really exciting for a custom network too, is it not? Like the main chain link price, totally independent.
00:28:53.426 - 00:29:22.480, Speaker A: It's independent thing. That's incredibly exciting. I think that's why people are going to want to tune into this particularly is to learn. Okay, so actually, Zach, I was going to tell you because one of our questions is I'm going to address a couple of these questions. Anna, can we document the process we went through for building the dawn? There's not good documentation on docs yet for this, I don't think. Zach. So that's some work for the deverel team to do next because after this people are going to get interested and want to know how to do that.
00:29:22.480 - 00:29:26.660, Speaker A: Seb, have you documented this anywhere? Is this in a blog how you did this at all?
00:29:27.110 - 00:29:28.034, Speaker C: Not really.
00:29:28.152 - 00:29:51.546, Speaker A: He's developing. He's not writing documentation thing. Anyways, we'll work on that. Anna, good question. That is something that we will work on. And then what was the other thing I was going to say but there is a lot of documentation on docs chain link about how to become a node operator and that. So that's something you can absolutely discord and work with.
00:29:51.648 - 00:30:29.400, Speaker C: Yeah, we use the documentation for basic requests so you can make direct requests to node. And really it's a very simple mechanism. Every time there is a trade it just does a loop over all nodes listed in the aggregator contract. It makes a direct request to them. And then there is a callback function which receives this result and takes the median again on chain. As soon as there are three answers. This way we can guarantee the feed is always live.
00:30:29.400 - 00:30:34.406, Speaker C: That's how it works.
00:30:34.508 - 00:31:02.410, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, I got some comments in the chat. I'm trying to keep track of everything in the chin ecosystem, every announcement that goes out, every VRF or a lottery, whatever it is. So we don't keep getting to the details of absolutely every project until they come on my show and we hang out and talk and I learn it so that hey fat John, don't give me a hard time, I'm learning about it now. And for those people watching, that is the username. I'm not insulting anyone. This has been incredible.
00:31:02.410 - 00:31:39.420, Speaker A: Zach, thank you so much for coming on and providing a technical perspective. There are a few more questions in the chat that we won't have time to get to, so I am going to suggest that everyone in the chat who's interested in this, which is everybody, now head to the discord. All of the links to the gains network socials and website and all that are down in the YouTube description. So you can go down there and join right now. But before we sign off, seb, why don't you tell us a little bit about like I know you've been developing all holiday, what's coming up in the next month or two or three for gains network. What do you have in mind?
00:31:40.050 - 00:32:27.242, Speaker C: So really a lot of optimizations. We will add also partial closing, partial adding to positions, and we will also bring stocks to the platform, commodities, indices and yeah, really a lot of stuff. You can find our roadmap in our documentation, it's on our website. Also a very important thing. This customer architecture will allow us to guarantee the stop loss. So if the price goes very fast below the stop loss, we can trigger it at the price that was set. And it's really a unique point.
00:32:27.242 - 00:32:47.410, Speaker C: And that's coming also in the next update. So really a lot of cool stuff coming. And also, I just want to mention that we can add any cross pair between two pairs. So for example, if we have doge listed and tesla, we can do a Tesla doj pair.
00:32:48.310 - 00:32:49.202, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:32:49.336 - 00:32:58.440, Speaker C: We can really cross the pairs any way we want. We can basically just divide one by the other and just provide the market for that.
00:32:59.130 - 00:33:02.710, Speaker B: Tesla doge may just break the Internet, that combination.
00:33:04.730 - 00:33:17.880, Speaker A: Tesla does chain link polygon gains. I love it. Hey, a million more questions came in, but we are out of time, so join their channels. Hey, Seb, do you have an article coming out with Chainlink today? Have you connected with Chainlink today?
00:33:19.530 - 00:33:20.926, Speaker C: I don't. Don't think so. Okay.
00:33:20.948 - 00:33:50.566, Speaker A: I'm going to connect you with Chainlink today because some of these questions, they want to know about your background, kind of what you're about, and a little more about the gains network. So I'm going to connect you with Chainlink today and get a post because they're always looking for great content, and this will be great content guaranteed. And then you guys will be able to read more about that. Join their communities. There's a great one here. Can more chain link nodes be added to the dawn? Go to the discord and ask and find out what you need to do to join that dawn because, hey, we got some juicy alpha leaked here and I love it. Seb, thank you so much for joining me.
00:33:50.566 - 00:33:54.150, Speaker A: It has been awesome to meet you. Let's catch up again in a couple of months.
00:33:54.300 - 00:33:56.486, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a pleasure. Thanks.
00:33:56.588 - 00:33:59.878, Speaker A: My pleasure. Zach, thanks for coming on, man. I appreciate you joining me.
00:33:59.964 - 00:34:01.702, Speaker B: Always, man. Always be here.
