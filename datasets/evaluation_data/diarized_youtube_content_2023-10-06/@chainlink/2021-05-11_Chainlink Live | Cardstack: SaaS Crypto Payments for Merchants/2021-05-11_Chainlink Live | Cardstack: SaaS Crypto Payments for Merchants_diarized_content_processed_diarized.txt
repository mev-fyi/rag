00:00:00.170 - 00:00:03.034, Speaker A: What are you seeing in Defi lately, Chris? What's going on? What's exciting?
00:00:03.162 - 00:00:19.710, Speaker B: I think what's exciting is that the primitives are being put together into real usable applications. There's still a lot of primitives being introduced, but every single day that comes in, people are adding new things to this pizza. It's going to be a really supreme pizza with all the toppings that you want.
00:00:19.860 - 00:00:35.720, Speaker A: I love it. When I think of primitives, I think, like, stablecoins is one really core one. And I've just seen a ton of different takes on stablecoins. Like, how do you keep it by its peg? What do you want the peg to be? It doesn't have to be a dollar. It can be an arbitrary number.
00:00:37.450 - 00:01:00.830, Speaker B: The thing about stablecoin is that at the end of the day, people want to use stablecoin to do something. It's great that we have many type of stablecoin, but they should be more fungible. Right? Like to be able to pay with any stablecoin that's accepted by a merchant. It's kind of the same way you can accept any currency except by visa. Right? So those are the things we're going to start seeing, that these primitives becomes on ramp for different currencies and different community, but at the end of the day, it's just payments.
00:01:07.430 - 00:01:23.090, Speaker A: All right, we're here with Chainlink live with Cardstack and Chris. Say, my name is Andy Boyen with Chainlink Labs. And Chris, why don't you get started and tell us what is cardstack? What's exciting about it? And then jump into what is cardpay, your new product, your new release.
00:01:23.250 - 00:01:47.440, Speaker B: Absolutely. So cardstack is thinking about building a decentralized software ecosystem, replacing the Silicon Valley giants, hosted and locked in into an open source, open marketplace for people to build any type of software that you want. So we're focusing on essentially composability, not only on chain, but in the cloud, in your mobile app, so that one interface, cardstack, allows you to access all the great things on web three.
00:01:47.970 - 00:01:53.646, Speaker A: Great. So I can build my own dap using elements from cardstack? That's the idea, absolutely.
00:01:53.748 - 00:02:06.690, Speaker B: And we have this idea of a composable unit called cards. They're like mini applications, and you can combine them together to build workflows or build your own space and deal task tracking. And that's the idea of our kind of framework.
00:02:07.190 - 00:02:20.214, Speaker A: That's cool. I heard a bit last year about like a no code revolution is coming and that sort of idea. And we've seen that on some apps, but it seems hard for web three stuff. But is that your model? Is that the basic idea?
00:02:20.332 - 00:02:43.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I think no. Code is a very high bar. So to be able to allow end user to composable, that means that you also make it more composable for developers. We don't believe that the end user just get trapped into some limited capability to skin and change the color. We want end user to actually build real apps. And if they go beyond the capability, because it's open source, developer can come in and build a module or build an integration completely running on the same platform.
00:02:43.810 - 00:03:03.206, Speaker A: It's still smart to me when I see people trying to build applications. You don't want everything on the developer. Nobody can understand the engineering except for one person on the team. That stifles speed to market and innovation as well, and creativity. Okay, so you've got these different elements you can plug in, and one of these is card pay, is that right? Is that the new one?
00:03:03.308 - 00:03:44.020, Speaker B: Yes. So we are starting basically with the same one with wrapping the primitives about crypto as it exists today, which is mostly around like stablecoin, defi, and payments, and say, well, let's start with those building blocks, because that's the one people know, people use them. And the way we look at it is how do we make that DeFi ecosystem accessible to regular people? And using that as a way to test out all of our deployment, all of our DAP hosting, all the wallet connect stuff, so that we can use that as a way to not only pay for whatever product you can buy with crypto, but also as the foundational point system, almost like v bucks or like Roblox bucks for our marketplace. So it's willing with payments because it's crypto. We start with value, and that's where we begin.
00:03:44.390 - 00:04:05.110, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, we were talking a little bit earlier. Cardstock has been around for a while. You guys have been building this. I've got comments here from community that are really excited to see you guys coming live and launching this stuff. So, seems like you've guys been building for a while for people that are just joining us. My name is Andy Boyen with Chainlink Labs, and this is Chris say, from Cardstack.
00:04:05.110 - 00:04:10.730, Speaker A: We're talking about Cardpay. They recently integrated Chainlink. Chris, what do you guys use Chainlink for?
00:04:10.880 - 00:04:38.360, Speaker B: I think what we use Chainlink for is using the amazing decentralized and reliable price feed and use that to help with exchange rates. At the end of the day, payments, when you go to a foreign country with your credit card, there's a bunch of conversion going on, like, what currency do you have? What is the interchange fee? What does the merchant want to accept in? And based on that, figure it out. Way to say, how many of your dollars or euro do we deduct from your account or bank account prepayer credit card to give to the merchant? We use Chainlink to help with that.
00:04:39.370 - 00:05:06.800, Speaker A: Know, when Tesla announced that they were accepting bitcoin, my father in law calls me and he's like, should I do that? Should we get a Tesla? And I was like, I don't know how it works, actually. I don't know what's the exchange rate and how that actually works, but when it comes to payments, that's a huge question. Or if you're getting paid too, when do you get paid? If you're getting paid in crypto, how much is that worth? When do you do that? And so to have a reliable price feed at the market price, you need because you want to be fair.
00:05:07.250 - 00:05:42.426, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think one thing worth thinking is that in defi, especially with trading and Uniswap being the real leader here, we always think we have to swap the token for it to be kind of locked down exchange rate. But in a lot of cases, you don't need to. If the merchant accept euro, pay me in digital euro. That's fine. We just figure out what is the rate at the time of the purchase so we can transfer the currency exchange risk from the customer to the merchant. That's not all that different than going to pay someone in bitcoin and telegram, you decide what price, usually USD, and you say, hey, okay, this is the lock, right? Lock on bit stamp or something, and then you agree on that.
00:05:42.426 - 00:05:45.306, Speaker B: We just automate that using Chainlink and the protocol in front of it.
00:05:45.408 - 00:05:52.266, Speaker A: Now, if you transfer the risk to the customer, does that make it cheaper and easier for merchants to accept crypto as well?
00:05:52.448 - 00:06:06.930, Speaker B: Yes, I think they don't need to have a fee for the slippage. Right. So as long as they are willing to say, you know what, I'll take doge, I'll take the currency up in risk. I accept Doge. And suddenly you get exactly the mid market rate. No spreads. Right? Because there's no spreading chain link.
00:06:06.930 - 00:06:18.120, Speaker B: We just take the fairest, most decentralized consensus rate on doge to USD and use that as a way to transfer the number of doge necessary to fulfill the USD or whatever value of the merchant's price.
00:06:18.810 - 00:06:54.810, Speaker A: Payments is a really interesting industry. I don't think people know how many parties are involved in the traditional payments ecosystem, and so much ends up getting offloaded to the merchants. If you want to sell something at your store, you got to decide what card to accept, how you want to accept checks like what your bank allows, how you're going to deposit those. If you're dealing in cash and you get $5,000 at the end of a day, what do you do with that pile of cash? There's a lot of tricks in there. So how does cardpay and cardstock, how do you guys envision joining this system? Or what kind of reactions are you getting from people in payments?
00:06:54.970 - 00:07:29.734, Speaker B: I think what happens when we talk to people in payments, that they see the idea of cryptocurrency as so efficient and so easy, because just by having an ethereum blockchain, you've got rid of the issuing bank, the merchant thing, these are all just on chain accounts. And so once you've exchange rate, got rid of the interchange of foreign exchange aspects. So all you're left with is fiat on RAM and off RAm, which, by the way, you can't uniformly does in different country, different jurisdictions, different needs. But imagine all you need is onboard to crypto and offboard to crypto. Everything else. The payment is all wallet to wallet. That's much easier than trying to figure out which QR code to scan.
00:07:29.734 - 00:07:38.074, Speaker B: Which card is it chip? Is it swipe? Do I use PayPal? Do I log in? Do I type my PayPal password on the supermarket terminal? Those will seem very archaic.
00:07:38.122 - 00:07:49.394, Speaker A: Almost going to overnight, I hope. That would be nice. Right now, we're still dealing with that is, which way do I stick my card in? I'm slapping it against the thing doesn't work.
00:07:49.512 - 00:07:54.546, Speaker B: Yes, please remove card. Please don't remove card. Put it back in, but not now.
00:07:54.728 - 00:08:12.714, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Well, this is cool. Hey, we've got a great amount of people watching here to learn about cardstack and cardpay. Look how excited people are here. So excited for Cardstack's project future. Great foundational work. Awesome to have your community here.
00:08:12.714 - 00:08:32.918, Speaker A: And I see the link community. Chainlink community is here as well. Hey, Mark, how you doing? Mark's in here popping in links to cardstack so you guys can go look at them. But don't go yet. Keep watching, because we've got more stuff coming up. Chris, you had some screens you wanted to share. I want to see demos and demos.
00:08:32.918 - 00:08:34.178, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:08:34.344 - 00:08:55.762, Speaker B: Cool. All right, let me share my screen. 1 second. So we are focusing on something called defi payments. I think payments as a category is a bit small. If you look at like Defi pals, it's a small category and we think it can be bigger. And the way we look at it is to build a DaP and build a mobile wallet.
00:08:55.762 - 00:09:34.882, Speaker B: And the reason we build a DAP is so that we can get onboarded value from layer one layer to layer two. So if we do transaction layer one, it's $80 or yesterday, today, or like $200 per transaction. But if we can get it in bulk, so let's say move a million, 2 million, $5 million of value over as a token supply. You have now funded the economic bandwidth in this layer two. And that's what we're building this DAP to allow people to kind of move value in bulk, almost like shipping a crate of supplies to an island. And then you do it once, and then once you have it all, the transaction is done between customer merchants on mobile app in layer two. And those fees here is less than $0.01.
00:09:34.882 - 00:10:04.494, Speaker B: We use XDI chain as the current, the first chain, which certainly has hope to integrate all the chains and use crosschain liquidity to allow you to pay between chains like Matic and XDI. But we started with XDI chain because that's great support for wallet connect. And obviously smart contract wallet like Nosasave works really well on XDI chain. We use that as a way to do that. So we have the web app. So let's take a look at what that will look like. This is one of the workflow that we support, which is allowing people with tokens to issue a prepay card.
00:10:04.494 - 00:10:45.658, Speaker B: So this is like creating an account you can give to your friend. So you just basically load up a balance of stablecoin into a wallet and instead of giving them transfer and giving them gas, you just give the entire wallet to them. Sure. So this prepaid card is basically a smart contract wallet that you can pre create on layer two. And then, so that suppliers who has bridged, let's say a million dollars worth of token, a stable coin, can create like $100 each. And then they can just give it to people almost like an NFT, like giving someone like a prepaid card in exchange for something. And then once you create a prepaid card, whoever buys this prepaid card basically have a wallet and all the gas they would need to be able to conduct transaction the same way.
00:10:45.658 - 00:11:08.718, Speaker B: If I give you an Amazon gift card, you can buy an Amazon or in person store. If it was for a particular retailer, so this is the process, and not only because this is kind of an orchestration for this particular workflow, this workflow engine. The idea of this 66% is actually the cardstock workflow system that we're using for our software ecosystem.
00:11:08.894 - 00:11:29.398, Speaker A: You're breaking up again. But this idea of building a module for a prepaid card. Prepaid cards. So there's basically like three kind of cards in the industry, maybe four. But there's credit cards where you don't have money yet. You swipe your card, and then you're going to pay it later. There's a prepaid card where you preload your funds, and then you pay it, and it comes off the card.
00:11:29.398 - 00:11:56.980, Speaker A: A debit card is really similar to a prepaid card. It's when you have cards in a fund already. And so when you swipe the card, it then goes and pulls those funds. And then there's a gift card, which it seems kind of similar to this because you can gift it, you can swap that out, and you can transact with that a little bit. So this is really cool. And this is a module. This is the card pay module that people can then use as part of their card stack application that they're building or adapt that they're building.
00:11:58.230 - 00:12:23.690, Speaker B: Exactly. And the prepay card is about the easiest way to get started. And then obviously, for debit card, that type of stuff, you would need to have access to an existing wallet. And as these prepaid balance becomes more what people use every day, your prepaid card kind of becomes your debit card, because there's no difference between a balance and a ethereum wallet, whether that's prepaid or reloadable.
00:12:24.030 - 00:12:40.414, Speaker A: All right, hey, I'm seeing your comments, guys. We're here with Chris, say, from cardstack, talking about cardpay and Chainlink. My name is Andy Boyne from Chainlink Labs. If you have questions, I can see your comments. We are open to questions from you guys. I think there were some earlier as well. So.
00:12:40.414 - 00:12:59.718, Speaker A: One sec, Chris. I want to see if I can find this question here. People are curious about the role of the card token within your ecosystem and the cardstack ecosystem. And I think you touched on this a little bit, at least implicitly. But if you can talk a little bit about that, what's the role there?
00:12:59.884 - 00:13:24.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so in the US especially, there is this credit card reward points, pioneered by American Express, where it's membership reward points. So if you spend money, you get points. And that's essentially the primary way we're going to distribute tokens. To people spending money, because that's the most real economic value that you want to reward. Liquidity mining rewards liquidity. We do spend mining. So that's one way for us to bootstrap the network to get more people with cart token.
00:13:24.330 - 00:14:12.218, Speaker B: So that's the number one thing is incentive to get people to choose this payment method over other ones. The second thing, the card token, is that there's also a protocol fee. Like the same way we want to make sure that this protocol has incentive for people to provide prepay cut services, be issuers, provide rewards. So we actually distribute and or burn a portion of the fee, similar to how protocol fees are deducted from rv or something like that. And that can be used based on governance for a variety of things, including burning it, distributing it to certain people as rewards distributed merchant and customers for spending this. So that unit for reward is what we use card for. And then the final one is that there are certain services on the network to register yourself as a trusted merchant, to vote for stablecoin to be included, especially new ones come out.
00:14:12.218 - 00:14:16.160, Speaker B: Those governance feature will require card token and that will create demand for it.
00:14:16.610 - 00:14:47.240, Speaker A: That's a really interesting idea. Your point number two I was thinking about is not only do we in web three need to think about how do we incentivize people, but we also need to lower barriers. And right now there's a lot of barriers in crypto, like just the idea of having fees that the end user pays instead of the merchant. When you go to the store and you swipe your card, the merchant pays those fees and you pay them implicitly, like you don't know you pay them, but you really do. But in crypto, your wallet pops up and says, do you want to pay 50 or $200?
00:14:47.610 - 00:14:48.118, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:14:48.204 - 00:14:52.300, Speaker A: To send money. And so using the token that way is still really interesting.
00:14:53.550 - 00:15:25.006, Speaker B: Card is a gas token. And the good thing about it is that because we're using layer two, the fees are lower. It will go up right as demand comes up, block space will become more expensive. But the most interesting thing is that all of what we do is from a smart contract wallet called nosasafe, which is usually used on mainnet to manage big treasury. But the basic mechanism of multisig wallet works for small denomination as well, if the gas fees are cheaper. So we're actually doing meta transactions, we're using card as a token. So if you're on XDI chain, you can use die or even card to pay the fee.
00:15:25.006 - 00:15:43.180, Speaker B: Using ERC 20, you don't need the native token we have a relayer using the great tools that dosys has already made, dosas, relay service and open source project, as a way to make it so that, hey, once you load up the balance, don't worry about gas. We'll deal with that. And that's really practical on layer two and we're making that some completely seamless behind a mobile app.
00:15:43.710 - 00:16:13.042, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm seeing questions about other layer twos. I don't know if you can talk about specifics. Sometimes those things need to wait for their time. But people are asking about, so I won't put that one up there. But Luke, I see your question and I appreciate those as people. So another question people are having is about where your plans are for these things to be accepted. Are you talking to merchants and what are kind of the questions that merchants have? Everybody wants to know who.
00:16:13.042 - 00:16:19.842, Speaker A: Of course you can say that if you can, but what are some of the questions that merchants have or the concerns that they have when they're thinking about this?
00:16:19.976 - 00:16:50.554, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's traditional merchant that has brick and mortar, that has a terminal. You go up and then in Asia especially, a lot of them accept QR code based scanning services. Now, obviously, wallet connect is very close to that, but there's still a little bit more work to do. I expect that to be the prevailing thing. Even in countries a little bit behind mobile payment will be the main thing. I think the most interesting people who are looking at this, as in like they really need it, is actually people selling digital goods online, right. For example, Twitter, about a week and a half ago did a tipping service and they used PayPal.
00:16:50.554 - 00:17:30.186, Speaker B: And if you pay someone PayPal, they share your home address. That's not good if you're tipping someone and you're basically leaking your home address to them. So there's a lot of problems in digital payments. So that's where we're going to start. We're going to focus on maybe the NFT marketplace or the kind of adjacent marketplace or like what kind of pure digital goods that doesn't make sense for you to integrate a credit card or like check and stuff like that. With that being said, mobile payment, our wallet QR code base is very compatible with where the world is going and we expect to create an SDK that is very easy for point of sale manufacturer. People who make these terminals very fragmented market, we would think that square will have a monopoly on it.
00:17:30.186 - 00:17:56.174, Speaker B: They don't. They have like a very tiny percentage. Every country has their own software company building hardware and software for them. We want to make sure that, hey, you do support WeChat. This is very much like it, except it's crypto payment on the other side. So that's the way we want to do it. And started with digital payment and going further and further with digital terminals into more kind of real world payment, knowing that in my heart of heart that more and more of this will shift digitally.
00:17:56.174 - 00:17:58.294, Speaker B: So we should focus on that to make that work.
00:17:58.332 - 00:18:24.798, Speaker A: Well, the square example is great. Square has a sliver of the market, but they're still a behemoth that just shows what the market opportunity is. Right. And you think about the need for payments and digital payments. People have problems with payments and they need to solve them easily and we need a good crypto solution. And this sounds fantastic. So I'm excited about this and I think our audience is too here.
00:18:24.798 - 00:18:45.170, Speaker A: Hey, I had another question for you. Sorry, I got off my question list just because we got talking about this stuff, but that's so this kind of lines up. What about other sort of traditional payments or new fintechs like Shopify or stripe or square PayPal? How do they compare it to this type of solution?
00:18:45.590 - 00:19:43.074, Speaker B: I think it's going to be a little bit harder for people who have in a traditional ecommerce mindset check out and pick one of the payment to really embrace web three, like the same way. You don't expect a traditional retailer to be the most advanced thinking it's actually easier to say, hey, we got crypto payment, right? Carpe. What if you make a crypto storefront? Where will you do that? Will you do that on WordPress? Maybe you can, maybe you can. Where's the wallet connect on WordPress? So what we've decided to do is to say, well, let's go build the Shopify storefront for crypto products, including nfts and other kind of redeemable socks or shirts or something like that. And I think that's what we will see is that people who adopted their wallet and wallet connect and that kind of QR code will want to do more with their balances. So instead of using a prepay card to pay merchant, you're paying hosting company or you're paying protocol to do something for you. That's what we are doing with cardspace, which is the next release after cardpay, is to start thinking about the storefront for merchant.
00:19:43.074 - 00:19:57.580, Speaker B: Not just merchant, but also influencers and creators interested in crypto community want to buy, sell swags and sell memberships. Those, I believe is the grow area, intersect very nicely with the second generation of NFT products on the market.
00:19:58.750 - 00:20:39.334, Speaker A: The creator economy right now we can see with the dogecoins and the kitas and all those things is just blowing up on the TikToks and everything. How old do I sound on the TikToks? I am that old on the TikToks. But you've got this generation of content creators who they may want to have their own crypto storefront and as well as a traditional one side by side and when one outperforms the other, or if anyone is a viable revenue stream for them, that's pretty important to do. I know some creators who are there on twitch and they're just trying to figure it out. They don't really care how they get paid as long as they can get paid in an easy way.
00:20:39.452 - 00:21:14.702, Speaker B: Yeah, and the great thing about the composability of crypto is that it's very hard for you to come up with a mileage program for an airline. There's a lot of work to it. But to create a reward program for a creator or group of creators, really easy, that's just a community token of different sorts. So I think part of the advantage of us is that once we build the reward distribution for cart token, which is like the base level reward for our entire network, support every merchant and customer. The same mechanism for reward distribution, you spend one dollars, you get this. If you have this level, you get double the rewards. That same mechanism, which we call the tally protocol, is available to all users, including creators.
00:21:14.702 - 00:21:29.210, Speaker B: So imagine creator using our situation to actually reward company who is user, who's actually spending money buying nfts. That's how they can distribute the token. Much better than an Excel spreadsheet and an expensive airdrop on mainnet.
00:21:29.630 - 00:21:49.946, Speaker A: Cool. Well, this has been fantastic. We got a lot of questions and so I want to encourage our community. Hit up Chris on Twitter, maybe up cardstack on Twitter. I'm going to drown his mentions out. And there's plenty of communities that we'll make sure and drop down in the description if they're not there. Already got a great amount of viewers.
00:21:49.946 - 00:21:58.954, Speaker A: Now's the time. Drop in. Any more questions specifically about cardpay, about the release? About what was this called? Cardstream card space? Is that space?
00:21:59.012 - 00:22:23.930, Speaker B: Yes, cut space. So that's the DAP hosting, no code. So very easy to use drag and drop. You can create your own crypto distribution reward program as well as merchandises that you can price and people can pay using the layer two wallet that we provide. And it's again compatible with any web three wallet, including metamask. But we made it so much easier because you can Apple Pay load of a balance and stop spending.
00:22:24.750 - 00:22:50.274, Speaker A: There is a tweet thread from cardstack from a couple of days ago that I'm going to drop in the chat because it actually helps. This helped me a lot. It's about the card protocol and how incentives and stuff work. So I'm just going to drop this in right here. I found this helpful everyone, if you want to go take a look later, stay on this video because we're not done yet. We are wrapping up. We are on time.
00:22:50.274 - 00:23:05.462, Speaker A: So I do want to thank you for coming, Chris. And I really want to thank the audience here for asking great questions and being with us. Before we go, you said card space is next. What else is on the roadmap for Cardstack? Get us excited and then show off your t shirt before you go too. I want to.
00:23:05.516 - 00:23:40.302, Speaker B: Sure, absolutely. So after card space, which is a hosting platform, adapt. One of the things we want to do is to make an App Store so that new developers of dapps and other new protocol can add new modules so that people who are creating the space can pull in a module to book an out at a time if you have a certain community level. So those type of features do not need to be in 15 daps where you have to remember the URL and make sure it's not a scam. Right. So you do it all in one site, whichever URL you choose, cod space XYZ or something like that. And that becomes your way to tap into all the developers creativity and assemble user experience just for your community and your audience.
00:23:40.302 - 00:23:45.940, Speaker B: So card catalog, which is our marketplace for components for card spaces. Coming in Q four.
00:23:46.310 - 00:23:52.646, Speaker A: I have a card catalog. I'm going to look down there on my right. There's an card catalog back there.
00:23:52.748 - 00:23:57.398, Speaker B: I love it. Yes, they don't make them anymore. So you have an antique there.
00:23:57.484 - 00:24:12.490, Speaker A: Yeah, we had to salvage it anyways. Fantastic. So we got some roadmap stuff. A ton more coming from cardstack. Show off your shirt. I got this shirt years ago and I've lost it since because now it was years ago and I need to get together with you. We're going to do swag swath at the next.
00:24:12.560 - 00:24:22.606, Speaker B: Yes, this is the original uni socks. This is the cot shirt. We don't make them anymore and it was a limited run. I should have made an ELc 20 token on it.
00:24:22.628 - 00:24:25.150, Speaker A: That may be only we'd known.
00:24:27.110 - 00:24:29.330, Speaker B: But yeah, absolutely. Thank you.
