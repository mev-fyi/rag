00:00:00.170 - 00:00:44.550, Speaker A: The cross chain standard is here. Chainlink Cross chain interoperability protocol, or CCIP, just launched on mainnet early access CCIP is the most secure and reliable way to build cross chain applications. It provides a simple developer interface for sending tokens and arbitrary data across blockchains. CCIP is the most seamless and secure way for developers to create cross chain smart contracts. How does this work? CCIP enables cross chain token transfers and the sending of arbitrary data to a receiving smart contract on a different blockchain. For token transfers, CCIP supports transfers to a receiving smart contract or to an externally owned account like the user's personal wallet. When it comes to sending arbitrary data, this could be anything from the details of an NFT function, calls, status updates, or anything you can dream up last.
00:00:44.550 - 00:00:57.210, Speaker A: Both can be combined in a single CCIP transaction. You could transfer tokens along with instructions telling the receiving contract what to do with them on the destination chain. I don't know about you, but this is pretty exciting news. Crosschain powered by Chainlink.
