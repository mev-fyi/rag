00:00:06.490 - 00:00:32.322, Speaker A: My name is Dustin Goodwin. I work on Chainlink. I'm super excited to be taking you through the rest of the day. So our next talk is too much liquidity. The state of automated market makers in Defi. The race for Defi's biggest pool is really intensifying. What separates one automated market maker from another? Does a winner take all? Is there room for many? Each project represented is utilizing the Chainlink network.
00:00:32.322 - 00:00:49.420, Speaker A: This panel is moderated by well known Defi dad. He does a lot of defi tutorials, and he's Defi dad in the Ethereum summit, we also have Anton Bukoff, Brandon Isles, and Andre Belakov. All right, guys.
00:00:50.590 - 00:00:53.838, Speaker B: Hey, guys. Just making sure. Can you hear me okay?
00:00:53.924 - 00:00:55.326, Speaker A: Yeah, you sound great.
00:00:55.508 - 00:01:14.510, Speaker B: Great. Hey, thanks for having me. Excited to be here. Let's go ahead and start with a round of intros, just because I know we've only got so much time, and I really want to make sure Anton, Andre, and Brandon have plenty of time to speak. So I'll start. I'm Defi dad. I am a super user.
00:01:14.510 - 00:01:17.460, Speaker B: I'm an educator, and I'm an investor in.
00:01:19.670 - 00:01:20.430, Speaker C: The.
00:01:20.600 - 00:01:59.154, Speaker B: I think the awesome part about my role is I get to use all of the innovations that these guys build. So, anyways, really happy to be here and excited to talk with all of you. And also, if folks are interested, go to Defi dad. You can watch free Defi tutorials, and I cover all sorts of chain link topics as well. So, guys, who wants to start first and also maybe start out with, aside from who you are, give a pro and a con of amms just to get us kind of, like, warmed up, maybe. Brandon? Yeah. Brandon, you go first.
00:01:59.192 - 00:02:16.200, Speaker D: Sure. Yeah. So, hey, my name is Brandon, one of the co founders of Ampleforth. Happy to be here and talk with you guys. Yeah. So our project has been very deeply involved with amms the last few months with the launch of our liquidity mining program. Yeah.
00:02:16.200 - 00:02:50.082, Speaker D: Quick pro con of amms. I think a pro is just the easy to use and convenience. I think a lot of people are going to these amms just because it's so easy to use. Once you have metamask style browser installed, you have to go through any multi day weights for identity checks, that sort of thing. The cons are that the first generation of amms we've seen right now are very inefficient. Right. So if you were to imagine, like, uniswap is the scene on the New York Stock Exchange, I think you would very quickly be outmaneuvered by all the more efficient market participants, I don't think it would last very long.
00:02:50.082 - 00:02:55.620, Speaker D: So it gives you a quick feeling of the possible headroom of improvements for these systems going forward.
00:02:57.690 - 00:03:00.758, Speaker B: Awesome, thanks Brendan. Andre, you want to go next?
00:03:00.844 - 00:03:26.862, Speaker C: Hey, yeah, sure. Hi, I'm Andre, I'm a founder of Opium Protocol. And opium is the platform to build derivatives within like 20 minutes. So we can build any derivative just like in Bloomberg in a ticker and that's what we focus on. So of course market makers, automatic market makers is a very important topic for us. And my background also is traditional finance. So I used to be a trader, I used to be a fund manager for around ten years.
00:03:26.862 - 00:04:10.570, Speaker C: I used to be in a traditional finance and what I can tell that market makers, automatic market makers, it's not a new concept. So it's basically existing already for ages. And three main goals of the market maker is to provide liquidity. So that's number one, so that's the definition of the market making. Number two is to make some profit for the investors, for somebody who run it. And number three, it can be very different strategies. So I agree to previous comments that, yeah, it's not so much efficient at the moment and defi and if we think about next two points, it's very poor basically.
00:04:10.570 - 00:04:42.790, Speaker C: So making money for investor can be improved and I can tell later how and different strategies also not being run at the moment. So we've seen one inch is mooniswap and it's pretty cool, but it's so much more and that's what I want to emphasize. So it's pretty cool that we've seen automatic market makers. It's amazing step, but if you look traditionally it's very first step and it's much more in terms of priority of liquidity, but also return to the investors and pools.
00:04:44.170 - 00:04:52.220, Speaker B: Awesome. Anton, you want to go next? You have started an automated market maker, so you should be well equipped to answer this.
00:04:52.750 - 00:05:38.134, Speaker E: Yeah, I have a skin in the game. Yeah. So I'm Anton, I'm co founder of one Inch. One inch is project which united all the on chain dexes into a single huge decks. We tried to solve liquidity issue and build aggregation of all on chain dexes to achieve prices comparable to centralized exchanges and sometimes even exceeding them. And recently we launched our own amm. We did some special architecture changes to solve some issues that we found with existing automated market makers.
00:05:38.134 - 00:06:09.860, Speaker E: We realized that most of them earn only fixed fee, but users when they swap, they pay two different fees. They pay fixed fee and slippage fee. Slippage fee depends from volume. The more users swap, the worse is the rate. The more is slippage, the more is fee. And we realized that almost no one of existing amms earn on slippage. They only earn fixed fee and we tried to solve it.
00:06:13.830 - 00:06:54.926, Speaker B: Awesome. Let's go ahead and start off with talking about the strategy of just using amms because everyone here, including Anton again, who's actually started Mooney swap, is using amms to help grow your platform. So recently I'm trying to remember her name. I think it's like Martina Krug. K-R-U-G. Anyways, she's a great defi analyst and she was talking about the fact that as we see more and more amms come to market, we're going to see competition. And that competition is all about making it more and more frictionless to move liquidity.
00:06:54.926 - 00:07:27.450, Speaker B: And basically, how do you maintain liquidity as an Amm with the Amm ultimately succeed? So I'm wondering if each of you can sort of comment on this, and Anton, you'd have the most insight on this with like, how do you think about know Mooneyswap has a migration for moving liquidity from uniswap over to Mooneyswap. I guess what I'm asking is how will Mooney swap compete with future amms that try to do the same sort of thing and offer big sorts of incentives?
00:07:28.670 - 00:08:41.950, Speaker E: Yeah, I believe that since different Amms give different returns to liquidity providers, it seems like liquidity providers will equilibrate these APRs among different protocols. And this would finish that. Some amms will have higher liquidity, some have lower liquidity, but they will have pretty the same APR but not like exactly the same. Because it's like for liquidity providers, it's like trade off between APR and risks. When they see new protocol with high APR, for example, they also understand that they have higher risks after they wait for one month, two months, and they see that protocol is not hacked, is working as expected. They more trust this protocol and this is like a risk APR trade off. Market is trying to equilibrate all the aprs with all the risks and liquidity will be somehow distributed.
00:08:41.950 - 00:09:50.730, Speaker E: I don't believe that some amm would capture all the possible liquidity. If some AMm is like twice efficient as any existing amm, it will at the end capture twice more liquidity and it will have exactly the same APR. Possibly. So yeah, we built migrator as was proposed and idea belongs to Martina Krang, but it's like the first stage of this migrator that it would just allow migrate liquidity because we came up to idea that we could bring expand this idea to all amms to allow people to switch between different amms without needing to convert any assets. If you have die and ever in some pool and want to switch to pool of different amm of the same tokens, you can switch without conversions. And we're going to also offer this service as one of subservices of our aggregator.
00:09:53.870 - 00:10:40.406, Speaker C: Can I just continue? Because that's actually a really good point. Anton said about different risks and this is a technical risk, this is risk of the execution of the protocol, so on and so on. But there are much more risks in the market. And there is risks like of Ethereum going too high or Ethereum going down. It's a lot of market risks, not only credit risk or technical risk, but a lot of market risks. And if we continue this logic into the accepting more risks then we can imagine it's going to be much more different market makers who are just not neutral to the risk. They can say, okay, I'm going to accept this risk, certain market risk, and I'm going to make more money for you.
00:10:40.406 - 00:11:18.370, Speaker C: So do you think Ethereum is going to collapse? No. Okay, then I can build a market maker which on this assumption going to make you two times more return or significantly more return. But if you're wrong, is Ethereum going to collapse? Then sorry, you lose significant part of your investment and a lot of people could choose for it. And this is only one example, it's only one risks. So you can imagine it's going to be very, a lot of strategies. And we are talking now about just spot market, about decentralized exchange from one asset to another and then make it more complex. We're talking about derivatives.
00:11:18.370 - 00:12:02.626, Speaker C: And when we talk about derivatives, amount of different risks or possibilities to take risk or sell risk is 100 times, 1000 times more. So you can build again much more different market makers strategies which a lot of people would like to take or another way around. They want to be safer, they want to have a strategy that generates less money, but it's more safe. Not only technically or credit risk or anything we're discussing right now, but also in terms of the market risks. And that's pretty cool. And that's my point, that probably in a year time to year time we should see the scaling. So we should see that the market making should be done on a L2.
00:12:02.626 - 00:12:25.340, Speaker C: And one of the things we do in opium, we say that blockchain is only settlement layer. And we're trying to do everything at L2. So far it's successful, but okay, it depends how much we're going to grow. Just want to drop this idea that it can be many risks, many strategies, what we're going to do if we grow 1000 times, if we grow 10,000 times what everybody expects, so what is going to be them?
00:12:27.070 - 00:13:01.350, Speaker D: Yeah, I think a lot of the conversations around Amm design tend to be framed around almost a zero sum trade off between design decisions. So for example, if lps earn more fees, that means less volume on exchange. Or if there's less flippage, then there's more impermanent loss. Or if there's exposure to only one asset, then there's less capital efficiency of those. And I think that's only half the story. I think if we go back to where we think amms can improve, right. We can kind of compare them to traditional market makers.
00:13:01.350 - 00:13:48.262, Speaker D: I think it's going to be improved by having access to more information. So that extra information can either be information about the marketplace. So for example, if there's an oil shortfall, traditional market maker would normally update their prices in response. Or if there's a period of high volatility, they typically kind of remove their liquidity from the books, wait for the market to find the next settling point, and then add it back on, because that's a period of uncertainty and they don't want to get railroaded. Then there's also information about the assets that they're dealing with, right? So Uniswap is kind of a jack of all trades. It doesn't really do anything special based off of what assets you're swapping. But curve is an example of an amm that makes use of the information, just dealing with two different stable coins, for example.
00:13:48.262 - 00:14:32.286, Speaker D: So it can give you very efficient pricing specialized to that use case. Also, just due to the way AMm innovation happens, innovation happens in the space different than what you'd see in the Linux kernel. It's not the case. Everyone just improves the same kernel or the same amm, moving it forward. Every new feature or new innovation kind of results in a new AMM platform being launched. So going forward, I expect we'll see an explosion of different Amms specialized for different use cases, different assets, or making use of different market information. Which means that aggregators like one inch I think will become much more prominent in the user experience of defi.
00:14:32.286 - 00:15:04.314, Speaker D: I think more and more people will be going to aggregators like one inch, and then whatever amm happens in the background will be sort of like what TCP IP is to web users. So that's sort of the way I expect to see things moving. And scalability on L2s, I think that's a great, nice to have. Right. But we do have dexes that use L2s like IDEX and diversify and the bring that sort of thing. But still the case that the convenience of uniswap I think is bringing users. So I don't think that scalability is going to be a driver in the short term.
00:15:04.314 - 00:15:19.940, Speaker D: In fact, it might even fracture liquidity. Right. If we have different L2s in combination with this explosion of different amms in the space. So that's sort of where I see sort of the amms going from.
00:15:23.990 - 00:15:28.482, Speaker B: Go ahead. No, this is a panel you guys should bounce off.
00:15:28.616 - 00:15:29.730, Speaker E: That's a panel.
00:15:30.730 - 00:15:31.480, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:32.010 - 00:16:43.194, Speaker C: It's really interesting what you say about the information, because what we see in traditional finance, the company is trying to build the fastest optical cable between Chicago stock Exchange and their exchange. They're trying to move as close as possible to the Chicago exchange and put the best cable and so on, because information is everything and information, that's basically the value in a finance and at the moment, automatic market makers we have, they uninformed, they always going to lose to informed market maker and there's much more. So they also good in mini reverting or only in mini rewarding type of strategies that there's another story and we can speak about it. But yeah, so I just want to emphasize that information is super important. And your second comment about that, we have it and everybody still use uniswap or other projects, I think it's a matter of money. So people nowadays in Defi, they want to make money and if somebody builds a market maker, that's going to bring you two, three times more money. So better API, they will switch within no time, I think within one day.
00:16:43.194 - 00:16:55.620, Speaker C: So what we've seen with Mooniswap, it was a lot of liquidity from the first day. So if you offer something which brings better return for risk, that's not a question. I think.
00:16:58.790 - 00:17:05.140, Speaker B: Hey Anton, did you want to add anything to just. I know we just went full circle again here. Anything else you want to add to that?
00:17:06.010 - 00:18:12.070, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure. I like wondering how many amms will launch it exactly this year because from January we had curve launch it and appeared it's like specialized AMM for stable tokens of single asset, like stable tokens of bitcoin, stable tokens of USD and potentially of any other stable token, any other stable tokens and we saw Unisop version two, we saw Balancer appeared. We saw also banker version two with single token exposure. And some of them have no dependencies like Uniswap and Balancer. They're both based on the formula of Alan Lu from Noises. He wrote all these formulas in his article on medium in 2017. But some of them are aware of oracles.
00:18:12.070 - 00:19:36.950, Speaker E: For example, banker two partially depends on oracles, but also can proceed without them on algorithm, which is similar to other Amms. And yeah, as Andrew said, amms are not aware of actual information. And some of them who are relying on oracles, they have also to check this and verify because Oracles updates not too frequently and always it's like oracles update after changes of the price of half person, and it's huge. And if you want to avoid oracle front running, you have to set up fees similar to 0.5%. It's like fees in each direction, so your spread will be like 1% if you want to just avoid oracle front running because anyone can see price movements before Oracle can get this information. And if you don't want to lose on it, you have to possibly get information faster. We also saw new kinds of oracles, which works faster than on chain oracles.
00:19:36.950 - 00:20:28.100, Speaker E: Let me remember, Coinbase Oracles, possibly. They do provide signature and with exact timestamp of value, so you can bring value with your arguments of transaction. It will be most up to date than on chain oracles, which are updated by separate transactions. But it's not exactly the fastest way to deliver information. But that's also an issue of blockchain, because blocks are produced every 15 seconds. You can't have a faster way to deliver this information because you don't have way to faster process this information. Sure.
00:20:29.050 - 00:21:08.674, Speaker C: I think you mentioned another time that you did the research and that arbitrators, they make much more money than actual pools, and that's exactly the point. So the pools are losing because they're informed, and arbitrators, they are informed and they see the price drop. They go to, let's say, uniswap, and they start to make money on expense of the investors of that pool because there is no information on uniswap. And if you build this information there, it's going to be automatically reprised to the new values and you don't lose the money of your investors to the arbitrators. And that's really interesting. What the guy did, they actually calculated. And it's true.
00:21:08.872 - 00:21:37.130, Speaker D: Yeah. So on that note, ample and balancer have a really interesting integration launching fairly soon, where we can have a smart pool that's connected directly to the supply policy of ample. So when the supply changes, it can, in line in the same transaction, dynamically update the weights in the smart pool to automatically update the price as well. So that removes a whole class of impermanent loss from lps in that scenario.
00:21:37.790 - 00:21:43.770, Speaker B: Guys, I have a question. Sorry, guys. Was that Anton?
00:21:44.910 - 00:21:46.870, Speaker E: Yeah, let me add shortly.
00:21:47.030 - 00:21:47.900, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:21:48.590 - 00:22:31.454, Speaker E: Okay, Andre, thank you for your great addition. Yeah, that's exactly the issue we tried to solve, because when we calculated how much arbitrage earned, how much users lost on the slippage, we realized that liquidity providers earnings are not enough. And we tried to solve exactly this issue. And we were like wondering when we found that. Our solution, which we came up to, was also proposed by Vitalik Butarian in 2017. But he was tried to achieve a different goal with the same solution. He tried to fight front training attack.
00:22:31.454 - 00:22:52.770, Speaker E: He proposed exactly the same solution to fight for training attack. So when we came up to this solution from different perspective, trying to grab some additional revenue for liquidity providers from arbitrage traders, we got front training protection for free, developed by Vitalik Butra.
00:22:55.750 - 00:23:04.840, Speaker C: But still, it sounds like all the formulas and approach we use is from 2017. So we have very old algorithms. Let's build something new.
00:23:05.210 - 00:23:57.702, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, by the way, I think we probably have to wrap up in about five minutes or so. And this is awesome. This is a much more organic conversation. I actually wish we could talk longer and go deeper on some of this. But just so we kind of COVID to finish off then to kind of COVID some of the grand visions you have for amms over the next year, because I think it's hard to look further out than a year right now where just everything is happening so quickly in DFI. So if you zoom out a year, how do you all see the landscape of amms? Anton was mentioning earlier, curve launched back in January. It's like, hard to believe all these things have been happening, but it's only happened really over the last six to twelve months.
00:23:57.702 - 00:24:34.770, Speaker B: So anyways, how do you see the landscape of amms? How do you see those amms competing with one another? And also I'm curious, not just about how they compete with one another, but how do they compete with centralized exchanges? Like how close are we going to get to flipping centralized exchanges in terms of trading volume? I mean, is that really that far out? Or will we see greater stablecoin liquidity in amms over the next year versus what we see on the centralized exchanges. Anyone want to go first?
00:24:35.380 - 00:25:38.340, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I dream that in one year it's going to be L2. Still, maybe Brendan not going to agree with me, but in order to compete with the centralized exchanges, in order to play on the same level, so the fastest blockchain still I don't know how many million times slower than actual trading in a traditional system. So in order to do so, we need a lot of speed, we need a lot of different strategies, and the competition is going to be done on the return, actually, they're able to generate or not on the risk, and users going to be more informed. They're going to choose something appropriate for them, the risk and return level. And I really hope believe that maybe not in one year, but in two years it should be like the L2 play, because it's algae trading. It's already invented, so there are a lot of companies who do algae trading, and that's much broader than just automatic market making.
00:25:38.340 - 00:25:40.360, Speaker C: So that's my dream.
00:25:45.260 - 00:25:47.370, Speaker B: Anton, Brandon, you want to go next?
00:25:47.820 - 00:25:48.570, Speaker D: Sure.
00:25:50.300 - 00:25:58.572, Speaker B: Launched Mooney swap. I'm very curious to see how you envision the future here, but. Yeah, Brandon, sorry, go right ahead.
00:25:58.706 - 00:26:45.416, Speaker D: Oh, sure, yeah. So I think we'll see a cambrian explosion of different AMM platforms all doing specialized use cases very well and more efficiently than others. I think the competition is going to be very fierce between these different players as well. Based off of trading fees, returns to lps, that sort of thing, it's going to come down to how efficient they are. To add more to that, Ampleforth is also planning to design an AMM specialized to the elastic token use case, like ample that has information about equilibrium bands, dynamic states and equilibrium states. So kind of a combination of balancer and curve and uniswap altogether. As far as like algo trading on Dexes go, my feeling is most algo traders are already algo trading on centralized exchanges.
00:26:45.416 - 00:26:59.570, Speaker D: So I don't know if decentralized exchanges are definitely a big draw for them. Of course, scalability is great. So if we have greater scalability, that's better than not having scalability. But I don't think that's the main driving factor for people who use Dexes today.
00:27:00.900 - 00:27:06.850, Speaker B: Guys, I know we got to cut out. You got 30 seconds and then we got to cut to the next talk.
00:27:07.720 - 00:27:46.750, Speaker E: Okay, I'll try to fit in. I wish to see a lot of different amms which behaves differently and earns differently on different market conditions. Some of them could earn high volatile markets, some of them could earn for different liquidity providers who want to expose only one asset. And the more different amms we will see for different purposes, which are efficient in their own conditions, the more users will benefit because we can aggregate them all in some Dex aggregators, like one inch and any other.
00:27:48.640 - 00:27:49.484, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:27:49.682 - 00:28:00.752, Speaker B: Thanks so much everyone. I know we got to cut out. Dustin, carry on. But thanks again. It was wonderful to get to join us and thanks so much guys. Brandon, Andre, Anton, you guys rock.
00:28:00.896 - 00:28:01.890, Speaker C: Thank you so much, guys.
