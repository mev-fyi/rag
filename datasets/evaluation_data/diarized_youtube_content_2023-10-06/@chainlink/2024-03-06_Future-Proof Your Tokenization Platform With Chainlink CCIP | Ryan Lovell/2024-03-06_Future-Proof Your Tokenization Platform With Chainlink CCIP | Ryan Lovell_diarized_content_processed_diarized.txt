00:00:00.170 - 00:01:24.934, Speaker A: One of the key issues that asset managers need to come to terms with as it comes to technology risk is not getting locked in to a vendor that's going to have eventually outdated technology. And I think as you've seen how this industry has grown, different chains are trying to solve the blockchain trilemma problem problem, which is security, scalability, and decentralization in very different ways. And if you get locked into a certain technology, that technology, at the pace of the way this industry is going, may only last five years. And if you're porting over processes worth trillions of dollars to a very ephemeral technology, that's not going to look very good over the long run. The great thing about Chainlink is its truly blockchain agnostic design. We will always be integrated into the latest technology because of the Chainlink platform. Blockchains need our core services, such as data, such as proof of reserve, such as automation for Defi, we will always have a cutting edge advantage on being in the latest technologies so that asset managers don't have to make that bet.
00:01:24.934 - 00:01:39.000, Speaker A: They can just connect into the entire ecosystem and they continue to evolve with their processes, and we're right there with them channeling all of that value and customization for their customers.
