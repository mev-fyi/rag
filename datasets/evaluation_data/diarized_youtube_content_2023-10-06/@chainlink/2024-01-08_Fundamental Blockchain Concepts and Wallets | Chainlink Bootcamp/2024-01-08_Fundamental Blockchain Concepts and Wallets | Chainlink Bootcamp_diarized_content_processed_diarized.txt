00:00:05.510 - 00:00:48.582, Speaker A: Hello everyone. I'm so happy here starting the year with you. I'm really proud in leading this boot camp, in planning this, I'd like to say thank you to our chain link live team that support me and help me on these initiatives. Ah. And yes, I love to teach beginners so it's a really pleasure to be here with you. Yes, we are starting now and some points to you before I start to really show the shadow knowledgement with you. The first point is this.
00:00:48.582 - 00:01:36.006, Speaker A: Today is the day starts from zero. So this is the day that we have less practical and more theory because I will talk a bit more about blockchain, about Webitree and the practical part you'll be related to wallets. So we are starting our first wallet from zero. So I am using metamask. I will install my metamask and install again really from zero. So if you know a bit more, if you already have your wallet done, don't worry. Tomorrow we are creating our first smart content and then in two days we starting the chain link stuff.
00:01:36.006 - 00:02:24.646, Speaker A: And I have a lot of things to share with you. So is this now I share my screen? Yes, there are a person ask it if this is being hackered. Yes. So if you cannot follow now, you can see it later. And yes, I'm doing this in English and I'm seeing some people from India. I was in India in December in the hackton and I tried to do in a time that is not so early to the US people, but also it's in a time that the people from the other side of the world can follow as well. Life.
00:02:24.646 - 00:02:45.630, Speaker A: This is my goal. And no, we don't have any prerequisite. It's from zero. We are really starting everything now. So let's go. I need to share my screen with you. Let's find the right presentation.
00:02:45.630 - 00:03:07.700, Speaker A: I was doing some tests and I have two screens. So sometimes I'm looking for one or for another. And you are here in the middle. And this is our goal. So don't worry. Looking for the screens in one. I have your chat so I really follow you step by step.
00:03:07.700 - 00:03:32.220, Speaker A: Almost done. Let's find my boot camp here. Here we are. Boot camp in English and this is. Here we are. Let's share my screen now I lost you. I find you.
00:03:32.220 - 00:04:28.766, Speaker A: And another interesting question like mark is asking if you are doing a full project. Not this time. My goal here is to create separate sessions related to different topics and chain link services. For example, when we are creating ERC 20 token, also we are creating token shop to buy our token using a price in USD and using data feeds when we are creating an NFT. So you learn all the concepts related to an NFT but let's automate this NFT as well using creating a dynamic NFT using chain link automation. Another point that we are covering, it's cross chain communication. This is the most important topic for now.
00:04:28.766 - 00:05:14.662, Speaker A: I'm so proud with CCIP when we have our token. We are learning about CCIP using an ERC twins token when we are learning NFTs. How can we do some cross chain operation with an NFT using CCIp as well? And also we have vrf to generate random numbers. We are creating some kind of game using VRF and we have a surprise. Create using functions to connect with an external site. And this is we are creating separated small projects with each top key. You can try to create your own project, join everything at the end.
00:05:14.662 - 00:05:53.756, Speaker A: But this is not a course to do a project at the end. But it's Malaysians. It depends of one lesson to do the other. Yes, but they are separated and write comment. Okay, let's share my screen with you. Here we are. So let's talk a bit about me.
00:05:53.756 - 00:06:10.176, Speaker A: My name is Soleil Jigeris. You can call me Sol. I am a developer advocate at chain Link flat. More than two really. I enjoy to be here. I think this is my dream job. I do what is my best.
00:06:10.176 - 00:06:53.244, Speaker A: What I love to do that is teach not only about the company that I am, that I love it, but also teach the beginners. How can I start people bringing more people to Webitree? Because I'm here. Because I think blockchain and Webb three will change the world. This will be like the base for the future and we are starting. If you are starting now, you have a lot of time to learn and to be part of this. Like I'd like to change the world and I would do this with blockchain and the web three. This is my twitter.
00:06:53.244 - 00:07:47.490, Speaker A: I used to post everything that I'm doing over there. Also my LinkedIn and my website used to be updated with all my events. Probably I will do some new updates because I have videos and this must be easy to you. I'd like to do this in an easy way to you to find old content over there. I have content until 2019 on my website. I'm doing my first talk about blockchain and bitcoin. It was 2017 and at least since 2018 I started to do workshops, boot camp, starting to teach smart context and to teach how the base can also to go to the device atop to chaining for me, this is amazing.
00:07:47.490 - 00:08:12.424, Speaker A: And talking a bit more why I like Chainlink. It's interesting because on Chainlink lab I can be in touch with all the blockchains. Remember, in some moment I will talk more about chainlink for you. But Chain Inc. Is not a blockchain. Chain link is a platform with a lot of services that you can use in different blockchains. And this is the point.
00:08:12.424 - 00:08:44.404, Speaker A: I am in touch with our blockchains, our technologies in the same time. And this is really amazing for me. Let's go to our blockchain. Intro is this. First of all, what is blockchain? And I'd like to tell you that there are different ways to explain blockchain. And I'm explaining one way for you. Maybe you are hearing other in the future and one of these will be better for you.
00:08:44.404 - 00:09:21.916, Speaker A: So it's important to know that we can see these and explain these in different ways and they are complementary. Here I can say that blockchain is a chain of blocks. And because really we have blocks that are connected. And what do you have in a block? In a block, we have transactions. Three kind of transactions. A transaction can be, for example, only a transfer token of the native token. Or a transaction can be the creation of a smart contract.
00:09:21.916 - 00:10:19.292, Speaker A: And the third kind of transaction is a way to interact with some smart content that is already deployed. Imagine that you can call some function in smart content that exists in the blockchain. Our blocks have the hash of the previous block. I will talk about hash later for you. But this is important that for now you can think that the rash is a unique cryptographic proof of a block. So if I have this proof in the next block, it means that they are linked. And if I try to change something in a previous block, I must change what's happened in the next block, and the next block and the next block.
00:10:19.292 - 00:10:59.580, Speaker A: And because of this, we used to say that blockchain is immutable. Because if you try to change something, the past, you must change everything that happened after this. And also every block I didn't add here, have a timestamp. Like the time, exactly time that block was added in the chain. When we talk about blockchain, it's useful to you to think about a state machine. A state machine. It's like a set of photos.
00:10:59.580 - 00:11:37.236, Speaker A: Pictures. Imagine that I have this hand up. So I have one hand up, and now I have the other hand up. To change from one hand to another hand, I must do a state change, because I have a picture with this state and then I have a picture with this state. To do this, I do a transaction. So the transactions change the state machine. We used to say that the blockchain, it's a state machine and transactions change the state machine.
00:11:37.236 - 00:12:30.488, Speaker A: You can change the balance of a token, the amount of token that you have, for example, from ten to five. Or you can change some information, the information a to the information B. And like I said before, the state changes, you be on blockchain. So we have the word pictures and the blocks with the transactions in the middle changes the word state. This is one view of blockchain for you, a bit more. So let's go deeply on this. When you talk about blockchain, we must have three main elements that this is the compound of blockchain and the blockchain.
00:12:30.488 - 00:13:20.376, Speaker A: It's like a mesh of concept that already existed before something like this. On blockchain we are based on cryptograph. And we can have a cryptograph word when you don't must trust on people or on companies that can change things out the rules. But with cryptography we are really trusting on math and this cannot change. And this is really immutable. And also we are based on distributed systems. Because all that I said to you related to blockchain, it's distributed.
00:13:20.376 - 00:13:59.748, Speaker A: Let's understand this. And there are a gamey theory in the middle that I will talk more about this for you. Let's start with cryptographic. We are talking about to have some kind of writing hidden. And this is something like this. A function that I have text and a message, for example, that with this dictionary I can translate the message. This is one kind of cryptographic.
00:13:59.748 - 00:14:54.600, Speaker A: But for us, talking about blockchain, we use three topics of cryptograph. The hash function, public key and private key and merco tree. These are basic concepts. Let's start with the hash function. I used to say that the hash function is really a function algorithm that you entry something and you have some result. And in this case, we are using hash functions that you enter any kind of information, any size, and the output has a fixed size and it seems like it's random, but it's not. And I am in the wrong here.
00:14:54.600 - 00:15:28.208, Speaker A: So imagine this. I have a document or a transaction. And this document will be translated in a binary way, like zero ones, and then pass in the hash function. And I have the hash of the document, for example, can be this. Some things related to the hash is deterministic. So every time that I try to do this the hasoot will be the same, the process the same. It's really fast to create a hash.
00:15:28.208 - 00:16:17.220, Speaker A: This is a one way. So if I have it the source, I can create the hash. But if I have it the hash, I can't discover the source. So this can be useful. For example, if you like to prove that you are the author of something, that you have the original, you create the hash and publish on blockchain. So to prove that you was the creator, you have the service and you can create the hash again and prove that the hash that you are creating now is exactly the same hash that you did five years ago. For example, another interesting point, that any change, any small changing in the original source can change the hash completely.
00:16:17.220 - 00:16:52.220, Speaker A: Imagine that you add any space you cannot see, but you change your hash for sure. And depends of the kind of hash. The hash that we use to use on blockchain is collision resistant. So two different documents or services, you not generate the same rash. Let's go to this and I share this with you. Before I share this with you, I used to do and there are in some places here. Let's go here and then come back.
00:16:52.220 - 00:17:33.692, Speaker A: I used to have a pet that I share with you and then we are working together here. It's a bit challenger to have a pad with this amount of people that we have now. Let's see if it is working. I'm equating this now. So let's add some content for you and come back. First of all, let's put a title and I will invite you to put here like your name and your city country. So here I am.
00:17:33.692 - 00:18:02.080, Speaker A: So from Sao Paulo, Brazil. So where are. Oh, I forgot to pass this for. Wait, wait. Yes, now you have this on YouTube and I will create a divider here. So do this steps and let's take a breath to the people. Join our pad.
00:18:02.080 - 00:18:40.000, Speaker A: Because I used to have this pad to share all the content with you. And this is important to me to interact with you because we can write together like you are seeing this now. We can delete everything. Be careful. But the goal, the pad will be like deleted in one month. I will share with you a git book later with all the content in a way that you can follow step by step. But the pad is like our temporary documents to interact.
00:18:40.000 - 00:19:10.970, Speaker A: And yes, we have a lot of people here. Amazing. So happy. Yoohoo. This is really amazing. And this is like I said before, I try to put undivided down. Yes.
00:19:10.970 - 00:20:01.730, Speaker A: And below this I put some content to show so you can finish. Yes, really we have people from out the world. This is really amazing. Let's wait a bit. Tomorrow we have a lot of people so let's wait. And I'm missing some people from Brazil. I saw some people that speak Spanish as well.
00:20:01.730 - 00:20:33.580, Speaker A: Remember that we have another session today, 600 p. M. Brazilian time in portuguese and other session at 90 p. M. Argentinian timey in Spanish. So we have this in really three languages out the days. And if you'd like to learn a new language as well, try to join the other sex shows.
00:20:33.580 - 00:21:37.370, Speaker A: Don't worry, the screen will be back. I'm only waiting a bit more to have a few here. This is really amazing. I used to be an excellent tester for the platform, for the software as well because we have 190 people in the pad and it's working well. So this is amazing. I'm testing the pad with this amount of people and in some minutes I'm adding the content for you and the people that is adding in our chat, the YouTube chat. It would be better if you added in the pet.
00:21:37.370 - 00:22:18.928, Speaker A: 200 people in the pet now. Amazing. Oh, let's answer a question. Meanwhile, if you are not a developer, you can do the boot camp. Almost until the last section, I used to say that if you can copy and paste, you can do the boot camp. But what happened is like you will be able to do everything that I'm doing, copying with me. But maybe when we try to do this alone later you must study more to be developer.
00:22:18.928 - 00:22:48.892, Speaker A: Okay. And if you are. Oh, someone deleted everything, I can believe. Could someone do a control Z? Oh, I can figure it is later. But is this if you are not a developer, yes, you can do this. If you are a developer, you'll be faster and you can create your own projects faster later. But if you are not a developer, you have more time to work and you must work.
00:22:48.892 - 00:23:18.910, Speaker A: And yes, sometimes we have like, yes, some people that delete everything. Okay, we are trying together in a few minutes. Okay, let's come back here. It's hard when we have a lot of people. No worries about it. Here we are. I will share this with you probably in the YouTube chat now.
00:23:18.910 - 00:23:47.518, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a shame. We have someone that is deleting everything. It's really a shame. But I will share out the content with you later. Okay, here we are. Let's work on this now. So this is under scratch.
00:23:47.518 - 00:24:24.670, Speaker A: Amazing tool to demonstrate a bit more of blockchain. Let's understand what is the hash that we used to have on blockchain? Is this kind of hash. And imagine that I created the word documents. Yes. And I have this hash over there. If I created the document with a space and the hash change completely. Really? The beginning, it's like D six, BD.
00:24:24.670 - 00:24:53.982, Speaker A: And then 48 c six. Look, the end, four, C 89. And one eight six is completely different. Oh, I must hide this. And yes, I will talk a bit more about webb tree during the sections. Okay. And this is the concept of resh.
00:24:53.982 - 00:25:17.600, Speaker A: Let's go to the block when we have a block. Let's talk about the block later. Because I must talk with you about the nouns. And I prefer to talk more content later. Okay, let's see our pet. It's a shame, but we can try again later. Okay, let's go forward.
00:25:17.600 - 00:26:04.538, Speaker A: Talking now about the cryptograph keys. There are different kinds of cryptograph keys. In our case, on blockchain, we are using the aximetric keys. So we have one key that is public key and another key that is private, like the private key. The idea is only you know your private key and the public key you can share with other people as well. And why we have this on blockchain. Some parts can be used to cryptograph messages and transactions.
00:26:04.538 - 00:26:55.120, Speaker A: And like, if you use one key to cryptograph the message, the other key, you decrypt the message and you can prove that that message was yours. For example, you cryptography using your private key, and you share the public key. The person that has the public key can see that you create that message, because only you has that private key. And this is the part of messaging. And as well, if you are signing a message, you are proving that only you can sign that message. Something like this. And you have the original information with the private key, you can go on this way.
00:26:55.120 - 00:27:46.030, Speaker A: The other point that I told you that's important related to cryptograph is the merco tree. Because when I have transactions, the transactions are rated in a block in the kind of mercotree. So this is a data structure, something like this. I have here different kind of information. And then I have the hash of rich information, like a text image, a document, another kind of image. And we have the merco tree with a final hash. And if something of this change, we must change out this part of the tree and generate a new hash.
00:27:46.030 - 00:28:35.390, Speaker A: And I recommend you later to read the books from Andreas Antonopoulos as well. And this is the first book, the Bitcoin Protocol. This is a great definition of mercotry. That they are used to summarize all the transactions in a block, producing an overall digital fingerprint of the entire set of the transaction. And this is a very efficient process to verify that that transaction is included in a block and it cannot have a fraud. For example. And this is how this work.
00:28:35.390 - 00:29:25.372, Speaker A: On a blockchain. I have the blocks, I told you before, the previous rash, the timestamp. We are talking about the nosulated. And this is the transaction route with the hash of all the transactions in a block. And another example for you, how you can prove this? Oh, I must translate this. I have some Portuguese here. And is this now, second important point related to blockchain distributed networks? And I like to use the concept of networks of Internet with these diagrams from Paul Baron.
00:29:25.372 - 00:30:37.704, Speaker A: When we are going from the centralizer to the distributed system and the blockchain is here, we used to say that we are decentralized, but we are here distributed, okay? And this is the point when we have all the information going to the same point. And like you send a bomb to that point, you can destroy everything. When you have a decentralized, we have some points of failures, but when we are really full distributed, every node can communicate with every node. So like to destroy something like this, or to change something, you must really interact with our network. And this is really hard. And this is blockchain. When we talk about blockchain, remember that I told that chain of blocks? So each node that's part of that distributed network has this.
00:30:37.704 - 00:31:27.290, Speaker A: So we used to say that this is a ledger that we can write the transactions and the ledger of states. And we have this distributed in all computers, all nodes that are part of that blockchain. And this is. Let's go to the next point, the gaming theory. And we are not talking about video gaming or playing games only. We are talking about the study of the decision making between individuals. When these people like the decision of one, you impact the result and the decision of the others.
00:31:27.290 - 00:32:46.508, Speaker A: And this is like a game like interdependency. So we are talking about probabilities and how this works. On blockchain. For example, we used to talk about the problem of the byzantine generals, when if you have like three different places, and they must attack afford together and must be together, but they are separated, how can they coordinate this? And how can you trust that the message is sent from one to another is right? And this is the consensus that we must achieve on blockchain. Like if someone tried to change a block or try to propose a new block, how can we be sure that that block is right? We must have a consensus. And this is a kind of gamey theory, and this is the point. Consensus will be the mechanism that ensures that the parts agree that a certain state, a certain new block can be added in the chain.
00:32:46.508 - 00:33:27.700, Speaker A: This is the truth. And the first kind of consensus used on blockchain was the proof of work with bitcoin. And the idea is that it's hard to create a valid block. But when you create the valid block, it's easy to verify that this is right. So is this very difficult to calculate is to check what you have in the transaction. Not in the transaction, but what you have in the block. Hash, we have announce.
00:33:27.700 - 00:34:00.276, Speaker A: So announce. It's a number that is discovered by tentatives. So try the number zero. What's happened with your block? Try the number one. Try the number two. And you must find a block that the main hash of the block, or in case of the children, we have a specific place with the hash. This hash must start with some amounts of zeros.
00:34:00.276 - 00:34:50.780, Speaker A: And to have this kind of hash, you must try do a lot of tentatives until you find the right nouns to do this. So this is a test of computational work. And yes, you are like using your computer, the effort of your computer to do this. And this is the way that you can prove that you are right, because you have a lot of effort to do that. And it costs money to do that, a lot of energy. And before go to the proof of stake, let's come back here now in the block part. And here, for example, I have you one block, and I have you one else.
00:34:50.780 - 00:35:51.992, Speaker A: You can see here that the rule in that case is the hashing must start with four zeros. And they used to say that this is the difficult of the block. Like if a block must start with six zeros, it's more difficult than if we start with four zeros, for example. So we must try hard, more tentatives. And what's happened if I add some information here? Let's add a transaction. Now you can see that my block is not valid anymore, because the heck she's not starting with zero. So mine is the process of discover of the nouns to get my block valid again, easier, the nouns changed, and now I have this hash again, that is starting with four zeros.
00:35:51.992 - 00:36:57.920, Speaker A: Okay, let's say that this is the transaction one and added the transaction two is not valid anymore. I need to mine again to be sure that this is right. So this is the concept of proof of work that start on bitcoin. When we talk about Ethereum, Ethereum changed the consensus from proof of work to proof of stake and on proof of stake. And also you can see this like proof of participation. You are not doing an effort with your computer to find gnomes valid nons, but you must stake coins stake some financial amount in the nativity coin of that blockchain. And the staking means that you are deposited in a place, a smart contract.
00:36:57.920 - 00:38:20.300, Speaker A: And then you participate in a kind of random way that you get your way to validate a block, to create a block and propose this block to be added on the chain. But what happened if you propose a block with a bad transaction? What happened if you try to do something wrong? You lost all your money or all your cryptocurrency that you deposit. So this is the point, like the economic system related to this, is that you will be punished if you try to do something wrong. Including that when we talk about proof of stake, if your computer that is part of the network, be offline a long time, you lost a bit of your stake as well, because you supposed to be helping and supporting the validation of the network, but you are not in doing this. So is this. This is the concept of proof of stake. And remember that ethereum is proof of stake.
00:38:20.300 - 00:39:07.208, Speaker A: And another kind of consensus that we have. And remember, consensus is the way that we have an agreement to add a new block on the blockchain, the proof of authority. It's a kind of consensuals that uses in permissioned blockchains. And we have a group of authorities and the nodes you define who can validate a block. Some blockchains have. It is in a mixed way. For example, the transactions are publicly, but the nodes that can validate transactions are in a way that it's approved of authority way.
00:39:07.208 - 00:39:43.220, Speaker A: Only that list of nodes can approve this. And this is the concept for now, for blockchain. I know that I go a bit deeply with this. I will not go deeply in Webitree. Now I have only one slide related to Webitree. And then we are creating our wallet after this. So Webb three, for now I bring only one slide and I will share my slides with you.
00:39:43.220 - 00:40:31.856, Speaker A: Not today. Tomorrow I start to share my slides with you as well. When we talk about Web three, the resume for today is like thinking about the evolution of Internet. Webb one is when we are consuming information, reading information, but it was not so easy to interact with the people on the Internet. Web two is the moment where we have the social network. It's easy to interact with other people using the Internet. And when we are talking about Web three, we are talking about too heavy.
00:40:31.856 - 00:41:22.470, Speaker A: All these kind of systems that we have in Web two and the social networks in a decentralized way. And remember that a decentralized system is based on blockchain in a distributed network. And here I have some examples as well, like the bitcoin, the theorem, the blockchains itself. We have chaining over there the concepts of NFTs, the bravy browser, for example, the metamask. It's a wallet that we are using today. And the DAos is a kind of organization, decentralized. And is this.
00:41:22.470 - 00:42:02.770, Speaker A: So this is only an overview for you and you are understanding more about this in all the next sessions. Is this. Let's go to the wallets now. And this is the moment that I will try to come back to the pad. Let's see if you can do this again. Okay, we have some people here. Is you here how you get Ben? And let's see if I can add some comments to you here.
00:42:02.770 - 00:42:36.936, Speaker A: Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's see. So we are using now. Oh, by the way, remember that I was here in the block. Let's do a bit more. Let's go to the blockchain itself. We understood what's a block? So the blockchain has the blocks linked.
00:42:36.936 - 00:43:12.376, Speaker A: If you saw the hash of the block one, this is the hash that is here in the previous block. This is the point. And this hash of the block two is here on the block three. So if I change here, everything that is after this is wrong. I have five blocks here, so I must create the hash of this block again. And the next. Now do the next and the next.
00:43:12.376 - 00:43:44.232, Speaker A: And this is. And like I said before, we have this in a distributed system. So I have here three nodes, three peers with the same information. And this must be sync it. So let's go to our wallet. Now we are using metamask. This is a wallet that will be injected.
00:43:44.232 - 00:44:22.880, Speaker A: Okay, I can go down, don't worry. Yes. And I have metamask installed in my computer. So I will uninstall mine and install a few from zero. So wait a minute. I am in a screen that you have not seen now, because I'd like to uninstall my metamask. Okay, done.
00:44:22.880 - 00:45:00.610, Speaker A: So now I can go here with you and do the download. So this is installing extension on my browser. I'm using chrome now. So edit to chrome. And I must change this later they start. So we are checking, we are installing. And I saw some people asking, is this being recorded? Yes, it is.
00:45:00.610 - 00:45:50.768, Speaker A: Do you have your certification later? Yes, it depends in the amount of if you really was in our classes. And here we are. This is the metamask. I install it in my browser. I love this fox. And let's agree and create a new wallet so you can choose if you'd like to help you metamask or no. Create a password wherever my password is like a weak password now because I'm teaching, so I know that this is not so strong.
00:45:50.768 - 00:46:32.290, Speaker A: Create a better password for me and create a new wallet. Okay, it it now you can see this video to secure your wallet. I'm not doing this now. I can talk a few about security of wallets later. I have some content for you. Yes. No, in fact, let's security your wallet now.
00:46:32.290 - 00:47:05.160, Speaker A: I have not seen the video, but let's security your wallet just now. What happened now? Now you have a set of words. We used to say that this is the backup phrase. He covered phrase or minimonic. And this set of works words is your wallet. It will be twelve rewards. And with these twelve words, the address of your wallet will be created.
00:47:05.160 - 00:47:54.216, Speaker A: So if you lost your password, that we did before, this is not a problem. But if you lost your twelve rewards, this is a huge problem because you cannot access your tokens, your cryptocurrency, everything that is in that blockchain anymore. So be careful. Don't lose your twelve words. And another point, don't share these words with anyone. If a person knows your words, this person can get all your money. I may share with you now, but I'm teaching you.
00:47:54.216 - 00:48:18.896, Speaker A: I will not use this wallet later. And I hope that you are not getting my money now because I may teach you. Okay, let's see. So these are my words. You have yours, take care of yours. Okay. It.
00:48:18.896 - 00:48:47.080, Speaker A: And I want to take this in another screen. I have them. And after this, it is mouth for you, not this. It's better for you now. Don't do this in real life. Don't show this to anyone. I'm doing this now because I'm teaching you only this.
00:48:47.080 - 00:49:29.530, Speaker A: And I will not use this wallet later. Okay, so next I must be sure that I have the words. Let's see if I did it. Righteous and 45678. I think it's this. Okay, now I confirm it that this is right. Then I have my wallet now.
00:49:29.530 - 00:50:07.360, Speaker A: Okay, next. And this is my wallet. Okay, you can see your wallet here. But also you should see your wallet here in the extension spot probably is not appearing. So click on the puzzle and pin the metamask. And now you can see the fox over there as well, like this. And then close some parts.
00:50:07.360 - 00:51:21.196, Speaker A: Let's understand a bit of our wallet and configurate our wallet. To be a developer, remember that we are learning. So it is normal that you can do something wrong or we can share something that we should not share. So the idea is that this wallet that we are using now, in these two weeks, don't use the same wallet with real crypto, don't put real it over there, don't put nothing that is real in this same wallet. If you have real money, use another wallet, not the same, because when we are learning, we can do something wrong, we can share your wallet and you didn't understand well, we are learning, so don't do this with real money. This wallet is only for testnet, only to learn. So what I must do now, I must change here, where I have the Ethereum main net.
00:51:21.196 - 00:52:05.210, Speaker A: I must present the test network. So show test networks. Okay, it's my pedalize. Oh yes. So, okay, I can go down again, no problem. Show test networks is this. And now you can see that I have more networks here and I check Sepolia DJ did an interesting question that I always answer live for you.
00:52:05.210 - 00:53:01.260, Speaker A: What about to have a different account in metamask GJ if you have a different account, if the account was generated with the same seed phrase, don't do this because it's the same problem if you share your seed phrase because you are learning, you can lost everything anyway. So really use a different CD phrase, a different set of twelve words. To have a new account with the same CD phrase is not good to learn. Okay, here we are. I am on sepolia now. So remember that sepolia. And when this disappear, it's like me doing a copy.
00:53:01.260 - 00:53:33.412, Speaker A: Don't worry about it. Is this. So here we are. Next point. What I have here, you can see that I don't have tokens, nothing. And we used to say that the nativity token, the token that is generated with the network. When the network, every time that a new block is created in a blockchain, new cryptocurrency is created as well.
00:53:33.412 - 00:54:16.112, Speaker A: This is the nativity token. And to pay transactions to create as much content to transfer some cryptocurrency or to interact with account, you must have it is nativity token. In our case, we don't have it. The nativity token or the cryptocurrency from the Ethereum network. You can see here that I am on Sepolia and Sepolia is one of the testnet of Ethereum. If I come back here, girly is another testnet from Ethereum. Linear is from consensus from the metamask team.
00:54:16.112 - 00:54:36.456, Speaker A: So this both as from Sepolia. This is deprecated. We are only using Sepolia now. Okay, so here we are. I have a wallet. Let's try an exercise. I'm not sure if this is working, but I'd like to see if you are with me.
00:54:36.456 - 00:55:03.990, Speaker A: I'd like to you to put your name and your wallet address that you create here. Where is my address? You can see this is Mao set of words and numbers here. This is my wallet. Here. Copy it. So if I come back here, I can put like. So.
00:55:03.990 - 00:55:52.530, Speaker A: If you need more lines, click on my here and go down. And this is the goal to create a new wallet and to get the address of your wallet. Can you share the address of your wallet? Yes, you can. Because if you'd like to receive something from someone, you can share this. But in the same time, this is public key. Every person that can associate that wallet with you can monitor your wallet and discover everything that you are doing with that wallet. And how can we do this? I will talk to this later.
00:55:52.530 - 00:56:26.024, Speaker A: Yes, we can survive. Okay. Some people put upstairs. It's good. No problem. We know that our bed this time, it's a mess, but okay, great. Are you creating a new system to you? Because we are doing exercises every class and in order to receive the certificate, you must do the exercises.
00:56:26.024 - 00:56:50.710, Speaker A: And we are creating a form to you to do this later. Don't worry about it. I don't know who sent me some sepalait, but thank you so much. And I will use exactly this now to talk about you. Yes, it was Tim. Oh, thank you so much, Tim. I love it.
00:56:50.710 - 00:57:30.320, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. How can I see this now? I may go into the iterisca. It's a block explorer, but I'm going to the sepolia iterisca here and here. Okay, let's add it here as well. So what is this? This is a block explorer. Because the blockchain is public. You can see all the blocks here, all the wallets, all the transactions in the same place.
00:57:30.320 - 00:58:14.960, Speaker A: You can see here, for example, this is a block. 51 seconds ago it was non finalized. Because this is another concept related to proof of state to a block be finalized. It's important to have some blocks that was created after this and only in that point that we have some amount of blocks and this cannot be heaved. We can say that this is finalized and the blockchain is really immotable. Okay. And here you can see some transactions, some contract interactions.
00:58:14.960 - 00:58:47.850, Speaker A: We are exploring this a lot of times. We are come back to this later. For example, see the consensus info of this. So who is the proposer the hash? And now in the proof of stake network we have two kinds of networks. One, this is the execution later and the other is the consensus layer. Let's talk about this in another moment. It's a lot of information.
00:58:47.850 - 00:59:09.410, Speaker A: Okay, let's come back here. I come back to the iteration and I get my wallet that I. Wow, thank you so much guys. I love you. This is amazing. Kids sent for me as well. Thank you, thank you.
00:59:09.410 - 00:59:43.950, Speaker A: And here we are. If I add my address here, you can see the transaction. So two people sent it for me 1 minute ago, two minutes ago. I can get the transaction here is from keys that he sent to it. And let's go to the overview. You can see here that I receive here. The transaction is inside here.
00:59:43.950 - 01:00:28.750, Speaker A: And this is the other block from T that I read, receive surfing. And for example, you can see the transaction itself. So this is really amazing. We saw the block, you saw the transactions and yes, we must have the state and you can see that now we have the success that the transaction is really finalized. Okay, good. Not the block yet, we are waiting the block be finalized as well. Okay.
01:00:28.750 - 01:01:02.964, Speaker A: So I'm really so thankful for you, so grateful for you that saying it for me. But everyone must have it. How can we have it? This kind of it that is not real. We used to get on faucets. Let's see how is the chain link faucet now? Faucet, chain link. I think I. Yes.
01:01:02.964 - 01:01:37.744, Speaker A: And let's share this with you as well. Here and here and here you can see that you can get some link tokens and in some moments you can get the sepalia tokens as well. Depends of the time. Because we have people that try to stole how they eat the sepolia. Eat in your faucet. This is not good. But in some moments we cannot offer this for the students.
01:01:37.744 - 01:02:15.292, Speaker A: But now I think we can. First of all, I must connect my wallet and this is so amazing. This is an example that I'd like to share with you. When we are interacting with websites, we are connecting our wallet. It means that we are allowing that website to get information in our wallet and to send the transactions using our wallet using a metamask. In this case. Okay, let's answer this question.
01:02:15.292 - 01:03:21.820, Speaker A: Yes, if you don't like to do it now, no problem. You can do this later, it's hackered and you have the link later. Okay, Demar and I'm connecting my wallet now metamask. And you can see that I must authorize on my metamask disconnection. So authorizing and yes, now you can see that I can get 25 link on Sepolia, we are using this link not today, but we are using in other days. And now I can get zero point 25 test. It depends, how can I verify this? Let's verify here first, but not only this, to get both I must do the login with GitHub.
01:03:21.820 - 01:03:50.826, Speaker A: If I'd like to get only the link, it's okay now. But for now we must have this. And if you don't have a GitHub account now this is not a problem. I will share another way for you as well. So let's try to do the login and. Oh, I didn't know. Let's try.
01:03:50.826 - 01:04:46.590, Speaker A: I will do this in another screen. Okay, wait a minute. It's supposed to be done, but it I can come back here and authorize the chain link faucets to see my information. Okay, no problem. And now I am connected in GitHub. I must verify again that I am human and send a request. Okay, wait a minute.
01:04:46.590 - 01:05:31.838, Speaker A: And for the people that don't have GitHub, that's find alternative for you. I have it, I only must get it here. I like this, in a few minutes I will have my transactions. But if you don't have a GitHub account yet, I recommend that. Great. But you can use this other faucet. Let's just edit this in both chats for you how this works.
01:05:31.838 - 01:06:36.594, Speaker A: You add your address here, let's copy my address. Probably I cannot get because I have a lot prove that you are not a robot. And this is not like a real mining, but it's like you are proving that you must do some effort with your computer to get this it. Okay, I started close the 0.5 life mining. If I stop now, are you lost this? In my case I maintain this a bit more, but this is another way. And this is interesting.
01:06:36.594 - 01:07:35.046, Speaker A: If you was in deaf connect that happened in Istanbul last November, you can get highly comeback. Now I have my wallet, I have some tokens over there, probably a bit more from chaining. Let's see what's happened. Okay, not yet, but where is my link? Remember that I cannot see my link. How can I see this now? Let's find it. Where is the link now? To get the link I may go into another point. Here's, for example, let's open this for you.
01:07:35.046 - 01:08:14.580, Speaker A: The chain link documentation has the link address for our networks. And this is the documentation. If I try to find link token, contract, link token contracts. Here we are. I can see all the contracts and I can see the address here. Let's share this with you. And also here, let's see.
01:08:14.580 - 01:09:07.160, Speaker A: So here I can see in the left side the sepolia testnet. And this is the address of the link token in the sepolia address. So if I clicking add it to wallet, I'm adding this token, the link token in my wallet. So add it to wallet, approve this edit token. And yes, you can see that I have 25 link tokens and you saw that I didn't got more sepolait. And probably this is because I already had this and this is enough. So I couldn't get more from the faucet, but you can get it.
01:09:07.160 - 01:09:53.222, Speaker A: So we are almost ready to create this much content. Tomorrow we have our wallet done. We already have tokens. So if you didn't get now, get the tokens later. It's important to you to have sepolia it, because you need this to create your smart contract together. Okay, so the people that could not get this now, yes, you cannot start this every 2 hours. If you try to share the horror with us and we can check it.
01:09:53.222 - 01:10:20.526, Speaker A: Okay. And it was something strange here. You can see that the transaction didn't appear. So I will share this later with the Chainlink clubs team. Let's see what happened. Okay. And let's come back to the questions and I will finish my presentation in a few minutes.
01:10:20.526 - 01:11:16.260, Speaker A: But I will stop my presentation now to answer some questions with you. So Hashi is asking if you need to perform the exercises for receiving the certificate. For sure you have exercises every day and only you are receiving the certificate if you do the exercises for today. I know that I didn't ask you now, but when I shared the form with you first day, what you must do? Create your wallet. So are you asking what is the address of your wallet? And you must use this wallet to our days, our sections creating the exercises session by session. Okay, is this. Let's see if I have any more questions.
01:11:16.260 - 01:11:55.518, Speaker A: Have. By the way, I'm using this time. Javier, are you around? I'd like to invite you to be here. Jeff and any community manager that is here, join the streamyard. Let's present you to the people. And I'm not alone here, guys. I'm teaching, but I have a lot of people that is supporting me to do this, including to prepare all the environment, all the communication, all the marketing part.
01:11:55.518 - 01:12:45.322, Speaker A: And I have a lot of community managers from Chinglink that are here, are around, and they help me and they help everyone creating their communities in different countries. Like we have Javier that take care of Audelatan people. We have Jeff that take care of the portuguese people, Brazil and Portuguese. And any place that speak Portuguese. We have Tatiana that it's in UK. We have Bara on India, that I had amazing experience with him. I already worked with joy in Berlin, and she's also on Asia.
01:12:45.322 - 01:13:10.242, Speaker A: So we have different community managers. We have Jamie on United States. And sorry if I forgot some of you. Now we can talk in another moment. But these community managers, they are around helping me. And it's not only them. Also we have community advocates.
01:13:10.242 - 01:13:57.190, Speaker A: The community advocates, they are with us because they like chain link, they believe in us like I believe in on chaining. And they are really enthusiasts of the community. They understand the community so well. So in some moments they help us, including doing Twitter spaces, doing live participating. I know that I have here some developers experts as well, and the developers experts from chaining clubs, they are developers that understand Chainlink a bit more. They do courses and certification inside as well. And they are being prepared to teach you as well.
01:13:57.190 - 01:14:37.246, Speaker A: Because imagine that I am only one and we have more curses. We'd like to have more sessions in different places, especially not only online, but in person sessions. And like me, I am a developer advocate on Chainlink Labs. We have more developer advocates like me that are here to help you. And they know, all of us know the chain link products so well. Some of them are more technical. Another like stay more with the beginners.
01:14:37.246 - 01:15:20.078, Speaker A: Like I love to stay with the beginners. I'm not the most technical of them. They learn and teach me. Sometimes, a lot of times they help me because I love to teach the beginners. And we have different aspects, like to have the best experience to developers. The idea is to have the Chainlink platform to be so easy to you developer, use it and creating amazing projects with Chainlink. And Kizzis commented about his full stackers from Petsky colleagues, amazing as well.
01:15:20.078 - 01:15:52.470, Speaker A: Petsky was a great developer advocate with us. Now he has his own company, but he's focusing on education, like me. And yes, we believe that education must be free for you. And you are creating the projects that can change everything. So I have one more exercise with you now. And okay, one more question before. Yes, not tomorrow.
01:15:52.470 - 01:16:30.234, Speaker A: In two days we start to work with oracles and chain link. Okay, today's tomorrow is still from zero. Tomorrow is how to create our first match content. Okay, what is the next exercise? I will share my screen again with you. And share the screen. And here we are. Okay, I will answer this because it was a mess for me as well.
01:16:30.234 - 01:16:55.106, Speaker A: Okay, chain Link advocate is a community advocate. It used to be not a technical person. And this is like a person that is an enthusiast. It's a volunteer, a developer advocate. It's a developer, it's a technical person that is hired by Chenik. This is my case. So they are different.
01:16:55.106 - 01:17:55.830, Speaker A: Okay, and let's come back. What is our exercise now? In some moment someone asked what about to use different accounts? Let's do an exercise now that we are creating a second account and transfer sepolait from one account to another account. Let's see what's happened. So here you can see that I have in the up part the account one, I can add an account. So I click and add you an account and add a new account. Okay, let's do it again. Click on account one, add account, add a new account and.
01:17:55.830 - 01:18:28.178, Speaker A: Okay, account two, great. Now I have a new account and this account doesn't have any. It. Our exercise will be transferred from the first account to the second account. So let's come back to the first account. This is my first account. And by the way, I have more it here.
01:18:28.178 - 01:19:07.510, Speaker A: Let's see what happened. Oh yes, you can see that more people transfer for me. Thank you so much. This is really amazing. And how is my faucet now? Let me. And now I have his ironing and claim he wants is this. Let's claim this.
01:19:07.510 - 01:19:56.548, Speaker A: So in a few minutes and you can see that we have a queue now, 140 way. In a few minutes you have this amount on my account as well. Okay, let's go forward exercise here. I will come back to my second account. Let's try again to do this when this is like a bit. It's not so messy like it's today. I used to ask it to one person to send it to another person, but now let's do for yourself only to learn.
01:19:56.548 - 01:20:36.302, Speaker A: Here we are. Now I can change to the account two, copy the address, share a few as well. Hey, great. Sylvia and I will come back to my account one. Yes, and I'm clicking on sent. Remember that today is from zero. Totally, totally beginners.
01:20:36.302 - 01:21:09.180, Speaker A: Tomorrow you'll be 0.1 like create your first match content. And only Wednesday we start to talk about oracles and create a token and it will be more advanced day by day. Okay, here we are. I'm in my main account, the first account. I have tokens here. Let's click on send, I paste the address of the second account and let's type send 0.1.
01:21:09.180 - 01:21:54.122, Speaker A: This is our goal. So here we are, my second account, 0.1. And you can see here that we are paying a fee to do this. This is the gas fee. This will be for the validator that is getting my transaction and adding in the block. And you can see that this fee can change. It's calculated like if you are on main net, we can edit this, but not now.
01:21:54.122 - 01:22:20.610, Speaker A: Let's do next. And here, for example, here is the market fee. I can change here if you like to don't wait nothing. You can pay more. Or if you'd like to wait a bit more, you can pay less. And this on passnet doesn't make difference, but on Mainet make a huge difference. So be careful.
01:22:20.610 - 01:22:58.744, Speaker A: Don't only confirm transactions without check the fee because you can send the $100 and pay 200. Be careful with this on main net, please. Okay, so let's put market the normal and confirm. Thank you. And here we are. I miss sending. You can see that it's still painting.
01:22:58.744 - 01:23:14.530, Speaker A: Let's get to the transaction here. View on block Explorer. Oh, it's confirmed now. One block ago. So my transaction is confirmed. The block probably is not finalized yet. You can see that it's not.
01:23:14.530 - 01:23:56.816, Speaker A: But if you come back to the first transaction that I got it, you can see that that block is finalized as well. So there are any change to my transaction. Be like he ordered or something happened. This is really on blockchain, really immutable now. And this is the transaction that I did. Now we can see that this block has 73 transactions, 16 withdrawals. And it is so congrats to everyone that did your first transfer.
01:23:56.816 - 01:24:40.388, Speaker A: So now you know the exercises that iu ask for you in a formulator. Not today, but what is your address? Are you asking the transaction of your first transfer as well? And this is our goals for today. I don't know how is my. Yes, I didn't finish my presentation. Why you shared this tomorrow, not today. Let's see if you have more questions before that. I may look in your questions.
01:24:40.388 - 01:25:13.196, Speaker A: Let me look in the comments. And another point, I'd like to stop sharing a bit. Friday, you'll be the section that we are starting step by step from zero. But on Friday if you. Oh, I could not follow the sections. I'd like to know something that was explained that I could not do yet. I have some dubs.
01:25:13.196 - 01:26:05.888, Speaker A: Friday we have a section with our community. It means the community advocates, the developers experts, another developer advocate in English. They will be here to help you, so they will be here to answer your questions. We are creating a form one day before to you. If you have something to ask related to the content that we already taught until Thursday, you can solve your debits on Friday and then use the weekend to be prepared to next week. Next week will be hard to be advanced compete. Okay? But this week it's really for beginners and I hope to have everyone with me.
01:26:05.888 - 01:26:28.960, Speaker A: And yes, it is hackard. We are sharing the link with you later today. Every content like. Jeff, Jeff, come here. Come to the stream link. And I can present you here as well. And Javier, the same.
01:26:28.960 - 01:26:42.300, Speaker A: Where are you, Javier, come here. And any community. Javier is here. Let's put Javier on stage with me. Hey, Javier, how are you?
