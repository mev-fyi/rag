00:00:06.170 - 00:00:21.840, Speaker A: Hey, I'm Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs. This is live. We're talking DeFi with Mintrist. Down in my lower diagonal quadrant, I've got Josh Rogers from Mintrust. Josh, give us what is mint special? How does it stand out?
00:00:22.210 - 00:01:06.946, Speaker B: Right, okay, well, what Mintrust is, is a pure lending protocol. And there's a couple of them that exist. They're all fairly significant. The most common, the best known are compound and Aave makerdao to a lesser degree. And what Mintrust is doing, pure lending plays, or pure lending money markets like that are fundamental pieces of architecture, really, for the crypto space. And Mintrust is actually designed specifically to be one of those pieces, like a utility, really, for the entire crypto space as a lending protocol. And what makes that kind of different is that the size and the scale and the intention of the project.
00:01:06.946 - 00:02:07.250, Speaker B: So there are lots and lots of Defi lending protocols out there, all trying to do different things. No disrespect about that, but Mintrust is designed specifically to become a sector leader and to bring new innovation into the space that really creates significant value and benefit for its users that currently doesn't exist. So the way we do that is how you reward users for using the lending protocol itself. And just like compound and Aave, you've got a range of token money markets where you've got lenders and you've got borrowers. But the key difference here is that we built some pretty cool tech that doesn't currently exist without getting all too technical about it. What we do is that the protocol makes an operating surplus, it generates fee income, and it does that from money markets, and it does that from what are called liquidations. And the point about the protocol is that it captures all of that income.
00:02:07.250 - 00:02:44.558, Speaker B: Now, what it then does is it automatically gives that income back to the users, and we do that via an automatic buyback process. So the protocol uses all the value it captures from its fees, and it goes out and automatically buys back its own token and gives that back to the users of the protocol. And the reason that's unique is because it closes the circle in the model. What you see is lots of lending protocols where the token has no relationship to the performance of the protocol. So the protocol is going really well. Fine. But the token price doesn't actually reflect that.
00:02:44.558 - 00:03:46.974, Speaker B: And the reason that's important is not just to drive kind of wealth for people. It's about that we want to reward people for participating in the protocol itself, and we want to do that in a way that actually gets more and more valuable over time, not less and less valuable, which is currently what happens in most models. The buybacks are kind of a revolution in itself, but the actual other revolution is the way that we capture all the income that the protocol creates. And we built an auto liquidation process, which means that liquidation fees, which normally get lost, we capture, and then we give those fees back to the users themselves. And by buying our own token price on market automatically, obviously what we're then doing is underpinning its value. And the more money the protocol makes, the more money it spends on its own token. And that has a big long term benefit for the users, because it means that the actual MNT token that we're giving back to them is ongoingly getting more and more valuable as the protocol grows.
00:03:47.102 - 00:04:14.398, Speaker A: There's a couple of things I want to pull out here in the defi space. We hear a lot about capital efficiency, and that's how users, if I deposit capital, I want to make sure I'm getting the best rate, I'm using the most amount possible, and in a risk adjusted way. But you're talking about that. But also, then there's this protocol, like incentives efficiency as well. There's this system going on in the back that's really interesting. So that's cool. And I think Zaji has some questions about that.
00:04:14.398 - 00:04:39.880, Speaker A: So just one sec on that. But the other thing I wanted to note is that this is on moonbeam. This is a fundamental defi building block on a new EVM chain. And we see this again and again on EVM chains when they launch. There's only so much you can do without a lending protocol. You can have a Dex and amm, and that's kind of it. A couple of other small things.
00:04:39.880 - 00:05:01.018, Speaker A: But really, when you want to start getting people's funds to do funds value plus one, plus two, plus three, do these sort of extensions, you need to be able to do this compounding value through lending. It's almost like a leveraged thing, but it's not. It's just a basic lending and borrowing, but when it comes to incentives. Zaji, I think you had a question.
00:05:01.104 - 00:05:13.322, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I just wanted to highlight that as well, because when I was reading about mentorist, I felt like that was such an important value add. And I wanted to ask you more about that flywheel effect. What inspired that? And has that been really effective with users?
00:05:13.466 - 00:05:58.522, Speaker B: Okay, so look, I have one competitive advantage when it comes to tech startups, and that is, I'm older than everybody else. That's the only thing I have, and I've been building startups since 1996, and I specialize in what I call, I'm an architect. I specialize in the architecture of network effects and how you maximize that inside of an existing model. So the key thing with Mitris is that we don't leave any fat on the table. When you look at traditional kind of models, what you're looking at is that the developers of the protocol are skimming, essentially, they're skimming or taking a percentage of revenue off the table that is actually profit. So this is above and beyond the actual operational cost of the protocol. They're actually taking cash profits out of the protocol.
00:05:58.522 - 00:06:45.774, Speaker B: We don't do that. So 100% of all of the operating surplus of the protocol is retained by it. And Mintress makes. When you kept talking about capital efficiency, Mintrus is like the most capital efficient protocol out there, because when you're looking at sector leaders like compound and Ave, for example, they're losing a very significant proportion of the fee income they generate to these third party liquidators who just take it all off the table. It leaves the protocol. Well, we capture all of that and we capture that, plus we capture all the interest income, and then we spend it all on, well, the protocol goes and spends the whole lot on its own token, and then we give it back to the users. So there's very little fat that is actually left on the table inside the model.
00:06:45.774 - 00:07:56.740, Speaker B: It's really about maximum efficiency. Now, the reason it creates a flywheel effect, which is what is kind of a cool term for what is a snowball or network effect, is that the more liquidity that comes onto the protocol, the more income it is able to generate. The more income it's able to generate, the more that it's able to spend on its buyback process of its own token, the more that it does that, the more it increases the value of the token emissions we give you. So when lenders and borrowers come into the platform, we're giving people MNT tokens, and the protocol is doing that in order to incentivize their use. Now, what we do is that the protocol is then going and spending all of its income on its own token, swapping that across, and it's then distributing back to the users. And if it's increasing that token price, it means the tokens that you get are more and more valuable, right? What happens is the more liquidity the protocol gets, the higher the token price, the higher the token price, the more liquidity it gets, because the more attractive it is to existing, to new users, to actually supply liquidity. I'm being too complex here.
00:07:59.910 - 00:08:07.570, Speaker D: The flywheel look great on a t shirt, Josh. I mean, we were talking about swag earlier. I mean, Mintress with the flywheel. I mean, that's a t shirt I would wear.
00:08:07.650 - 00:08:49.060, Speaker B: Flywheel is a network effect. It's a financially driven network effect. You do see them in other models in traditional startups. I haven't seen one yet in Defi, this is the first that I've seen, because the idea being is that the more liquidity that comes into the protocol, the more that the token price goes up. More the token price goes up, the more attractive it is to supply liquidity. So liquidity drives token value and token value drives liquidity, and you get this self reinforcing flywheel effect, which means that the bigger the snowball gets, the bigger the snowball gets. And you see that in models like Facebook and Google in other forms, but we haven't actually seen that in defi that I'm aware of.
00:08:49.060 - 00:09:24.910, Speaker B: And so that's really why minterest is quite unique. You look at other providers, their token price doesn't change, but the amount of liquidity that they bring on goes from like 100 million to 15 billion in the case of something like compound. But compound's token price is basically the same. It is today that it was a year and a half ago, because there's no correlation between the token price and the performance of the protocol. And when you link that together, what that means is the protocol can outcompete. It becomes more attractive for people to use it than against other existing models.
00:09:26.450 - 00:10:03.982, Speaker A: That's something that we've kind of noticed in the past couple of years as yield farming really came into prominence. Is what are these tokens going to be used for? What are these governance decisions? And in this case, it's not necessarily just governance decision. It feeds back into this loop. A maker kind of comes to mind as one of the originators of dealing with liquidations. And in the maker model is you've got to recruit people to come in and buy up liquidations, and it's a permissionless model. Anybody can join in, but there's some technical requirements and there's some independent requirements. You got to have capital requirements, of course, to participate in that system.
00:10:03.982 - 00:10:13.380, Speaker A: That's a little different. So that's kind of like the traditional defi model of dealing with liquidations. Is it an automated system? Is it like a smart contract, that.
00:10:14.710 - 00:11:07.490, Speaker B: It'S entirely run by the protocol itself? There's a number of unique smart contracts that have been done to develop that, and a lot of technical capability inside of building that efficiency. The point is that when you look at maker and you look at Aave and you look at Compound, each of those protocols have brought enormous innovation into the space. Compound brought in this new liquidity mining architecture where they actually gave borrowers and lenders tokens. Mako actually introduced the kind of external liquidator piece. Each of these protocols have really got strong adoption because they've brought new innovations that have made it better for their users. And we're wanting to do exactly the same thing. We're wanting to build on the actual value that's already or the design that's already been created, but do that in a way that's more efficient.
00:11:07.490 - 00:11:38.540, Speaker B: And there's nothing wrong with the existing liquidator model. It works and it's kind of very effective, by the way, up to a certain kind of size. But the sheer scale of Defi means that hundreds of millions of dollars of fees are now being lost. And we just think it's a better system and much more efficient and much more effective to give that income back to the users of the protocol rather than to external third party liquidators who are only one small proportion of the total community.
00:11:39.310 - 00:11:42.614, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm a believer in many solutions.
00:11:42.662 - 00:11:43.030, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:43.120 - 00:12:06.398, Speaker A: And if we have many different models, we need many different models so that we can scale in many different ways, horizontally as well as vertically. David, I want to give you a chance, because you've known Josh for quite a while. We were talking a little bit before. What is it about mentors that kind of stood out to you, or about people? Let me do a reintroduction, because some people came in. Hi, I'm Andy from Chainlink Labs. Chainlink Labs. Dave from Chainlink Labs.
00:12:06.398 - 00:12:36.960, Speaker A: We're talking to Josh from Mintrust. Mintrust recently launched with Chainlink nodes, Chainlink Oracles. And so we're going to talk a little bit about how they're using Chainlink in a minute, but we're getting to know the Mintrust platform. Really interesting lending protocol design that has kind of taken the models that we've seen over the past few years and upgraded them a little bit. Really interesting perspectives. But David, I just wanted to ask you, you know, kind of this product a little bit backward and forward. What about it kind of stands out to you, really kind of tweaks your.
00:12:37.650 - 00:13:15.260, Speaker D: I mean, I think that I owe a personal debt of gratitude to Josh and the Mintra's team because this is before I started chain link labs. In January, I was working in enterprise blockchain, primarily. Josh and the team invited me to come and work with them. And from the outset, what really attracted me to the team was just kind of like the intellectual dynamism, the way of looking at the world. It's a team that really is open to being challenged. It's a team that's pushing the boundaries in terms of new ways of thinking. And I think that by and large, Josh has just assembled a group of really high quality know for me, and I feel this similarly about.
00:13:15.260 - 00:13:58.394, Speaker D: I mean, for me, it's a great situation when you're doing work, if you can hopefully begin being renumerated, you're working with really interesting people and you're learning a lot of things. And I would say that going through this journey, and I was actually even working with the team prior to the first deck being ready. So I've been around longer than most of the people, even on the team. I can't believe a year has flown by. But throughout, it's keeping this kind of, like, open mindset. It's keeping a focus, really on the customer, and it's ultimately really trying to think about how to make this process more inclusive and more easier to access and more economically fair for the users of the Mitras protocol. So I think I've learned a lot from the team.
00:13:58.394 - 00:14:03.082, Speaker D: Josh has a good sense of humor, too, so I've enjoyed laughing at jokes as well.
00:14:03.136 - 00:14:05.420, Speaker A: Yeah, things got a little wild before we.
00:14:07.230 - 00:14:11.610, Speaker D: Exactly. That was probably the G rated version.
00:14:11.690 - 00:14:12.880, Speaker C: It's the late night.
00:14:15.330 - 00:14:53.126, Speaker D: Exactly. So, you know, it's been interesting to go through the, you know, any journey as a startup, and Josh kind of has a lot more startup experience than me. It's about pivoting, it's about re pivoting, refining the model, figuring out what works. And I think that the success that the team is going through right now in terms of building a really vibrant community is indicative that one of the main principles is to do right by people. I think that's on the team, that's within the community. And I think the team really exists to build a very successful project that is good for the community. And I think that's what, in our industry know, really strong founders and strong teams really focus.
00:14:53.308 - 00:15:51.500, Speaker B: So thank you so much, David. I just wanted to share some background dirt, and that is how David and I got to know each other is I spent a very long amount of time trying to convince him to come in and be the CEO of Mintrust before he actually joined chain. I think I spent like a month trying to convince him, and eventually he said no to me, which meant I had to take on the job because I actually wanted to actually sit back and be chairman and have. So I blame him entirely. But what was wonderful about the relationship, obviously, is that Cha link is such a centerpiece for what we do anyway. And it was just great to have that kind of insight that David does in terms of the market. And we're just delighted with how that literally, if I had to design a job for David to have that was not the CEO of Mintrust, it wouldn't be.
00:15:53.570 - 00:15:55.390, Speaker A: Pretty amazing. We're pretty fortunate.
00:15:56.690 - 00:16:33.434, Speaker B: So from our perspective, it worked out really well. But David's incredible resource. I'm on slack with David and messaging David kind of every week. I really enjoy working with him, but to reiterate that no one builds anything by themselves, and it's always about the team. How do you build a really effective, powerful team? I suppose that's my passion and love. Literally, as the business matures, I become less and less necessary, and that's a good thing. Having the crazy guy at the front run everything all the time is not a good idea.
00:16:33.434 - 00:17:27.962, Speaker B: So you backfill with competent people who are really effective at accountability. And it's a real privilege for me to say that the caliber and quality of people that are on our team is literally world class. And there's a really beautiful aspect to that in that there's a group of people who are really proud of actually being in the team, given who everybody else is. I literally pinch myself and go, oh my God, they let me actually come and work here. And because of the competency and the capability and the passion and commitment of what is now a fairly large team of people. So people don't talk a lot about this sort of stuff with startups, but it's actually fundamental, getting the job done. It gets easier when you're dealing with a culture and a group of people who are really aligned on where you're going.
00:17:27.962 - 00:17:32.122, Speaker B: And I'm proud to say that that's very much the case with our group.
00:17:32.256 - 00:17:37.680, Speaker D: In the words of Bo Chen Buckler, the University of Michigan football coach, it's the team. The team, the team.
00:17:38.290 - 00:17:38.942, Speaker B: Always.
00:17:39.076 - 00:17:50.866, Speaker C: Incredible. Well, no. And on that, know you were talking about all the different integrations you're working on, everyone that you're working with to make successful. What have you done with Chainlink? We haven't talked about that yet, but.
00:17:50.888 - 00:18:42.622, Speaker B: The key thing for us around Chainlink is it just locks in security. I mean, you guys are actually, the pricing oracle of choice for all the biggest players in the space. And when you look at all these exploits that are going on, it's normally got nothing at all to do with the actual pricing oracle itself. If you have a high caliber, high quality pricing oracle, it's when you're using these lesser kind of quality pricing oracle systems or you've got a difference between the tech of the actual model and its actual economics. And so there are multiple pieces that enable you to be exploited in terms of how people actually exploit the blockchain. That kind of stuff doesn't happen necessarily at all in, when you look at lending protocol models like compound and Aave, they're very stable. Arbe, for example, is a huge customer chainlink.
00:18:42.622 - 00:18:57.560, Speaker B: So for us it was always just absolute, like lock. And from our customers perspective, that's really important too, to know that that kind of very critical piece in terms of our architecture is locked in with a major player like you guys.
00:18:58.490 - 00:19:40.882, Speaker A: You said that the price feeds that we make, we don't make any, those of us here, right, decentralized nodes. And that's why I want to zero in a little bit. The way I understand mintrast users come and they add collateral, they deposit collateral, and the value of that collateral lets you take out however much in a loan. And there's some ratio there. The chain link price feed helps determine what is that collateralization ratio. And if you go below that ratio, you're going to get your collateral liquidated, and then that goes into the automated system and gets sold and whatnot. That's a really dangerous proposition to deposit your money in a place where the price of that collateral, the value is not secure.
00:19:40.882 - 00:19:54.794, Speaker A: That's chain link price. That's like the core value of those price feeds is to have hyper secure, decentralized, tamper proof price feeds so that you know when you deposit something, you're not going to get screwed by somebody just messing with one exchange or something weird happening, like.
00:19:54.832 - 00:20:04.560, Speaker B: Correct. Yeah. It's beyond exploitable because you simply can't exploit every single market in crypto. That's not possible. Well, if it is, I don't know how.
00:20:05.010 - 00:20:11.680, Speaker A: If you're exploiting every market on crypto, that's not an exploit, you're just manipulating the entire market and that's the accurate price.
00:20:13.010 - 00:20:17.410, Speaker B: If you can do it, you're going to be making better money doing other things than trying to exploit.
00:20:18.310 - 00:20:22.180, Speaker A: If you can do it, you're thanos snapping your fingers. That's crazy, man.
00:20:23.750 - 00:20:45.270, Speaker B: And look, literally, when you look at the exploits that do happen in the space. Not having world class or not having chain link as a pricing oracle is really a significant factor in how that's done. I mean, it's such a fundamental aspect of our business and it's just something that just needs to be mature and gives people extraordinary confidence.
00:20:45.430 - 00:21:02.346, Speaker A: One thing I've been excited about is the moonbeam. It's on Moonbeam's live chain link. Price feeds are now on moonbeam. Can you talk a little bit about that? I don't know if everybody, we just had a bunch of people join, so. Hi, everyone. Welcome. We're doing late night powered by Chainlink with Mintrust.
00:21:02.346 - 00:21:15.330, Speaker A: We got Josh Rogers from Mintrust. Can you talk a little bit about Moonbeam? What is different about Moonbeam from another EVM chain? Ethereum, a polygon, an avalanche, something like that? And why did you choose that? Why that choice?
00:21:15.750 - 00:21:50.794, Speaker B: So there are two answers. So the first answer is what's unique about Polkadot, right? And Polkadot is, I'm not going to get into the detail of it. I probably will do a video blog with my perspective on it. But Polkadot is quite unique. So Polkadot is not another version of Solana or Algorand. Polkadot is the mothership of blockchain. Once it gets going, it's got extraordinarily powerful network effects built into its model, so that existing chains get enormous benefit by actually being part of the Polkadot ecosystem.
00:21:50.794 - 00:22:43.546, Speaker B: Now, that's a medium to long term play. But the key thing that Polkadot also brings any kind of application that operates on it is the enormous security that comes with all of its community, which is vast at launch and its sheer efficiency in terms of the whole way that gas is actually modeled by its parachains. So you have these parachains that connect to Polkadot for people who are not across this. And each of those parachains is able to interact on the actual network free. And the only cost to them is a staking cost, but that's actually not a transactional cost. Now, that changes the whole paradigm in terms of gas pricing, and it changes the whole paradigm in terms of the size of the community and the amount of security around finalization on chain. That's a huge benefit.
00:22:43.546 - 00:23:33.226, Speaker B: Now, from our perspective, that was very attractive to us. And the reason that we went with Moonbeam and EVM is that we were looking for a solution that really looked after the customer so we could go and build our own power chain out and go and fundraise that and make all of that happen. But at the end of the day, we would literally have to replicate what Moonbeam has done. And to suggest that we're going to be able to do that when they've already done it, and that's their core business, didn't make sense. So it means that users who are using metamask on Ethereum can come straight over to Mintrust and use Mintrust. It's a seamless experience. But what happens that also matters is that the gas prices are paradigms, completely the paradigm difference in pricing between moonbeam transactions and anything else on Ethereum.
00:23:33.226 - 00:24:12.560, Speaker B: Now, avalanche and these level ones, these layer ones, are making a difference into that. But as you've seen with other layer ones as well, they always end up in congestion issues. At some point, Ethereum will go through, obviously, its 2.0 transformation, and that'll make a profound difference as well. But we just saw the existing tech in Ethereum now is aging, and we wanted to hook onto what we see is really the latest available. Polkadot, in my view, is a Ferrari, and Ethereum is not that. And it used to be.
00:24:12.560 - 00:24:37.890, Speaker B: Now it could be that Ethereum is able to do something quite remarkable, and that is build new technology onto a legacy system without issues. It'll be the first time it's ever been done in the history of the universe. But if they can do that, then obviously that'll make a big difference. But from our perspective, we really do see Polkadot as kind of. As part of that next wave.
00:24:38.410 - 00:25:17.290, Speaker A: There's a lot of approaches to scaling and to sort of consensus. The EVM, right, as this basic, that's the application layer that Ethereum runs, that the c chain on avalanche runs, that phantom runs, that BSc runs, that, like, all these runs. That's what's kind of unique about Moonbeam, in my understanding, is it runs the EVM so that you can have this cross chain, like some of this easy bridging. The fuller Polkadot ecosystem isn't necessarily married to the EVM. So there's other models in the shared security of the Polkadot parachain ecosystem. I don't know the terminology for you yet. I'm still learning that doesn't necessarily have to be EVM, that has some different programming standards.
00:25:17.290 - 00:25:20.110, Speaker A: So I'm really excited to see kind of how that develops.
00:25:20.190 - 00:25:43.382, Speaker B: There's a different underlying technology on Polkadot. It's known as substrate. So substrate is not just a new coding language. The actual coding language is rust. And that's an entirely new technology tech stack, essentially. And it comes with enormous advantages, technically, and we actually built Mintrast twice. So we built Mintrust out in substrate, right? And then we pivoted quite late.
00:25:43.382 - 00:26:28.650, Speaker B: We literally built 80 or 90% of the protocol out of the substrate and then rebuilt it out in solidity. And the reason we did was simply speed to market. It was quicker for us to rebuild the protocol, given that we'd already done the internal economics of it, that the technical build was not terribly long in comparison because we'd done all the background work. And the reason we did it was it gave us enormous options in where we launched on a solidig smart contracting platform. We could still launch on Avalanche, but we could also then launch on Moonbeam, and it gave us flexibility to do that. It's a decision that was actually unanimous amongst our tech team. And I can tell you, our tech team, they much prefer coding in substrate, because from their perspective, that is a Ferrari.
00:26:28.650 - 00:27:11.686, Speaker B: But they also understood the business case and the reason we did that, there was a very significant strategic decision about making that call, and I'm really clear it was the right one. But it could be that in the future, and this is all conditional on Mintrust community, it could be that in the future, it makes sense for us to move mintrust across to a more cross chain architecture built on substrate. And if that is the case, we've got the capability to fire that up and do that. But right now, Moonbeam is somewhere where we're very comfortable. We don't see that changing anytime in the short to medium term. At know Derek Yu, who's the CEO, they're enormous, respectful. We really like their team.
00:27:11.686 - 00:27:16.374, Speaker B: It's a great team to work with, and we're really happy about that relationship.
00:27:16.572 - 00:27:44.286, Speaker A: There's still a lot of emerging best practices on, like, do you launch multi chain? Do you launch single chain? And we haven't even seen a substrate, like a contained model or an IBC cosmos contained model or avalanche subnets. Those are just emerging. That's something in the next year or two that we're going to see. Maybe you don't even need to ever go to ethereum and avalanche and all the others. Maybe you can stay there. And the same for some of those avalanche. Total mystery.
00:27:44.286 - 00:27:45.826, Speaker A: I'm very curious to see.
00:27:45.848 - 00:27:50.130, Speaker D: My friends got wicked defi skills. Josh, don't mess with look.
00:27:50.200 - 00:28:30.174, Speaker B: It's a really good point, because timing is everything, and from my perspective, building out on substrate or mintrust, we were actually ahead of the curve. And being ahead of the curve, like, too far ahead of the curve is just as bad as being behind the curve, you sit there waiting for the market to catch up, and you never get it all 100% right anyway. So the reason for moving to solidity was because the world didn't move as fast as we thought it would. It didn't make sense for our customer base and for our user base. We were able to deliver the same model. Like, with some tweaks, we're able to deliver the same model in a smart contracting platform. So we went that way.
00:28:30.174 - 00:28:51.718, Speaker B: We're glad we've done it. As the world evolves, we might find that a substrate or a cross chain solution like that sitting solely on is the best outcome. And the key point is we've got that ready to go. Not finished, but near finished. And it wouldn't take much for us to get there, but I think we need to wait for the market to catch us rather than the other way around.
00:28:51.884 - 00:28:52.406, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:52.508 - 00:29:36.914, Speaker A: We have a question in the chat about what makes substrate more. I'm going to say different from EVM. There's a few things, and, Wayne, I'm going to ask you to go do a little bit of your own research, but a couple of things that I know. There's the shared security model that is huge, that Josh referenced earlier, where the chains and the pair of chains talk to each other and rely on the other validators for security so you can get more decentralization for less from other sources. It's kind of built in. And the other is, and I'm not exactly sure how this works, but the Ekala team told me about this, is there is testing baked in so that you can do better testing with more real world versions of tokens without having to just be on testnet, which is empty. And I'm not exactly sure how that works.
00:29:37.032 - 00:30:25.378, Speaker B: There's other things as well. There's a whole open source, what's called a pallet stack, or pallet technology, which is where you're building these pallets, right? And essentially, the pallets become like a plug and play, but they take this pallet out, put this pallet in, and you can build those, and those pallets are available as an open source to the community. So the more pallets that become available, the less coding that becomes possible. The idea being that over time, you literally get to a point where you're able to build applications very rapidly without actually having to build everything from scratch, because the palettes actually enable you to do that. That's a huge advantage long term. But the other thing that really matters is what's called off chain workers. You're actually able to, on chain have off chain workers, which means that you're able to activate things that are not actually on the blockchain, that operate separately to it.
00:30:25.378 - 00:31:13.954, Speaker B: And in solidity, that is not possible. It makes things slightly clumsier in the sense that you got to have an array of service operating off chain interacting with the blockchain, which you do not need to do in substrate. It's extraordinarily impactful in terms of your ability, in terms of functionality, technical functionality, you don't have in a solidity environment. In a smart contracting environment, and as far as I'm aware, you will never be able to have. Given the nature of how smart contracts are constructed, those sorts of kind of features are going to be big deals in the future. They're not a big deal this year. We can get away with applications where we can tweak it without that kind of technology.
00:31:13.954 - 00:31:54.340, Speaker B: But having just off chain workers capability in substrate is massive in terms of what you can build and the efficiency that you can build with the pallet stack. So there's a range of other things as well. Look, it's a highly, highly efficient. Rust is a highly efficient coding language from our perspective. And we've got a big team that code both now in Rust and in solidity. And from our perspective, that's a pretty strong competitive advantage to have as well. There aren't many kind of projects out there that have that capability built into their team.
00:31:54.340 - 00:32:26.790, Speaker B: We've got a big team. We got a team of about 2022 in our engineering team. It's not insignificant. And again, when you look at our smart contracts, we've used a framework of smart contracting that has been really derived from compound. We obviously sat down and researched Arve and compound and a range of other lending protocols. When it comes to smart contracting architecture, they're not that complex. So you've either got to go this way or that way, ostensibly.
00:32:26.790 - 00:33:03.350, Speaker B: And we took a framework that was based on compound, given that they've got a very secure system, in our view, which we respect. But something like all the smart contracts that exist inside of interest are like 80% coded fresh from scratch. Minimum, there's 37 smart contracts. I think something like 27 are derived because they're existing. If you're going to have a contract that says deposit assets, that's a pretty fundamental smart contract. It's very short. There aren't too many ways of reconfiguring that.
00:33:03.350 - 00:33:49.060, Speaker B: But literally right across our platform, about 80% of the code is new. And in the significant contracts that matter to do with auto liquidation. Everything that's all completely built ground up. So it hasn't been an insignificant project. And these projects are complex, right? Because they're fundamental, they're significant, and they're expensive to build properly. And I think something like the protocol to dates cost at least $10 million to build to date, and there's more to go. Mintrust is not one of the many kind of small D five projects out there.
00:33:49.510 - 00:33:56.354, Speaker A: So we're coming up on time. I want to check and see if any of our questioners have any more questions. We got a little time for a little lightning round.
00:33:56.482 - 00:34:11.260, Speaker C: Zaji, do you have know more generally, and actually, David and Josh, you'd both be get to answer this. Tbl has been increasing. Even though there's been a lot of ups and downs in the know, it just continues to increase. Why is that? Why do you think that is? And is it going to continue happening?
00:34:15.470 - 00:34:17.374, Speaker D: I got the answer for this one.
00:34:17.572 - 00:34:18.622, Speaker B: Off you go.
00:34:18.756 - 00:35:10.014, Speaker D: Oh, thank you, sir. I think it's because in the last cycle, there wasn't any areas with product market fit. I mean, Defi is an area with substantial product market fit. And if you're looking at your bank account, when I look at mine, I'm doing everything I can not to put my money in the bank, actually becoming worth less due to inflation, when I can be accessing these great defi yields. So I think that it represents a viable alternative to the centralized financial system, both economically and as Sergey our CEO, likes to talk about, people put their trust into code over time, more than institutions. This is what smart contracts are going to enable. So I think it's interesting for me, because when Josh and I started talking in January of last year, there was one area with product markets fit.
00:35:10.014 - 00:35:39.094, Speaker D: That's Defi. And now we have three areas, which are DeFi, nfts and kind of metaverse gaming. So the reason why I was attracted to come work at Chainlink Labs and get into this space is because I saw one area with product market fit, and I said, well, if there's one, there's got to be two and three, and if there's two and three, there's got to be four, five, and n. And I think DFI is the OG of product market fits in web3. And that momentum is going to continue even if there is a bear market lightning around.
00:35:39.132 - 00:35:42.002, Speaker A: Josh, what do you got TvL and DFI increasing?
00:35:42.146 - 00:36:27.446, Speaker B: Well, I'm going to say two things, one of them to do with this, and I just want to say one more thing as a close up. The first thing is, yeah, I've always been excited about blockchain tech. This feels very much to me like 2000, right? 1998 to 2003, there was a boom and a correction. But I think that correction that happened back in 2000 is now behind us. One of the reasons why is that we're in it, where you can talk about people's valuations in these markets, but the key thing that people don't take into account is the amount of value creation that's occurring. So in 2017, I looked at blockchain, went, oh, wow, awesome tech, but no depth. There's nothing actually being built here that actually going to create real depth of value.
00:36:27.446 - 00:37:02.530, Speaker B: And when these valuations aren't sustainable because there's no actual value being built behind it. Now, people say to me, crypto is overrated or overpriced. And I say, well, when was the last time we had a tech crash? The answer was 2000, and we haven't had one in 21 years. Now, the reason we haven't had one is because value creation just keeps going up. So even though the price of Google, like ten years ago might have been too high, today, it's incredibly cheap. And the reason why is just that value creation is a freight train. And the freight train in blockchain has left the station.
00:37:02.530 - 00:37:37.230, Speaker B: When you look at projects like Salana and Polka Dot, and you look at projects like chain link, the whole ecosystem of value that's getting built is so extraordinary and so rapid, that is not something that disappears. Whether bitcoin goes to $10,000 tomorrow doesn't impact that value creation process. And so that's unique. That's never been possible before. It's what got me really excited about the opportunity. I promised I would never do another startup again. And the reason I couldn't not do this is because it's just too exciting.
00:37:37.230 - 00:38:20.682, Speaker B: We're at the cusp of this whole new evolution, as far as I'm concerned, of what's possible on digital platforms. So that's really what got me started and being excited about it. But Mintrust is part of that play in the whole D five space is. I agree with David, we got like three clear user cases and we're going to have 15, and we're going to talk about when there are only three, right? And we're all going to look like grandparents when we do. And I'm hearing the same stuff today that I heard back in 1998 when everyone told me the Internet was a fad. So same stuff. And I don't believe that for a moment, in terms of the actual enormous value creation that's in the space.
00:38:20.682 - 00:38:37.698, Speaker B: So that's why I think you've seen TvL increase and you're going to continue to see that we see the opportunity long term. I don't care what happens this year. We've got a five year view, ten year view, and we want to be a player in that space. Just to finish, there's something I didn't mention and I wanted to steal two minutes if I can.
00:38:37.784 - 00:38:38.980, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, cool.
00:38:39.750 - 00:39:08.826, Speaker B: There's something really cool I'm really proud of and I haven't talked about, and that is that we've actually just released our own NFT. And the reason we've done this is not as a collectible. Right. We've actually created the top 100 most influential people in the history of blockchain. And so we created 100 images and we've gone out to a whole range of high quality illustrators and we've had them actually custom illustrate those actual profiles of those top 100 people. And we created the list quite. There's quite an extensive amount of work going through the list.
00:39:08.826 - 00:39:13.806, Speaker B: We reach out to a whole range of different people across the community. David was involved in the process.
00:39:13.988 - 00:39:25.742, Speaker D: Are any of the three of us on the list? Just out of curiosity. I didn't make it. Okay. I wasn't thinking I was going to make it. I was thinking more so Andy, but. Okay, that's fine.
00:39:25.876 - 00:40:03.594, Speaker B: Look, thanks for pulling me on the page, but this is our top 100. And the cool thing about these nfts is that our users actually earn them by participating in our upcoming LBP. And what these nfts give you is a lot more than a pretty image. What they give you is an increase, a locked in increase in token emissions on the protocol. So rather than earning the same amount of token emissions as everybody else, you can earn up to a 50% boost in emissions by actually getting one of these nfts. And there are twelve levels of value. And obviously, the more money that is spent in the LVP, the higher the level of value that you get.
00:40:03.594 - 00:40:52.090, Speaker B: But the other thing that they give you is that they act as a vip card and they give you access to the Mintrust protocol when we do our private launch. So we're doing a private launch which means that only users, only holders of the NFT will be able to have access. And the reason that matters is because there's a very small number of people and there's a very large number of tokens. So the entire thing is to actually act as a reward for people for participating. But we just thought it was something that was something that we're really proud of. We really wanted to celebrate the artists who actually supported us in doing this, something that we think is really kind of quite cool. But, yeah, if people are listening to this, please do go and have a look at it.
00:40:52.160 - 00:40:53.440, Speaker A: Here's me right here.
00:40:56.130 - 00:40:58.190, Speaker D: I think I'm in that, too. That's a good point.
00:40:58.260 - 00:40:59.440, Speaker A: You could be 78.
00:41:00.450 - 00:41:01.840, Speaker D: All right, this is good.
00:41:02.370 - 00:41:04.046, Speaker B: David didn't make it.
00:41:04.228 - 00:41:06.126, Speaker D: Oh, gosh. How could you say that to me?
00:41:06.148 - 00:41:10.178, Speaker B: Josh Robert from compound definitely did. Start me from, I'm not going to.
00:41:10.184 - 00:41:13.794, Speaker D: Be able to sleep tonight, man. It's going to be nightmares about this call.
00:41:13.992 - 00:41:29.670, Speaker B: Well, anyway, I think level twelve comes out this week, and when it does, we're going to Twitter everybody who is actually on the list and congratulate them. I think we're actually off a poster sized version, actually mailing them a hard copy because we think the caliber of the work of it has been great.
00:41:29.740 - 00:41:30.360, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:31.630 - 00:41:53.930, Speaker D: Josh, I just want to say on behalf of Chainlink Labs, we're excited about working with you and helping the protocol grow. And at a personal level, it's been an awesome journey and really value your friendship and learning from you and getting stuff done with you and the rest of the team. So it's been a lot of fun and the best is yet to come.
00:41:54.020 - 00:42:07.906, Speaker B: It really is. It's been a pleasure. Really has. And it's so great to actually be able to cement the commercial relationship. We've always had that big talking about it, but it was a very cool moment where it's like, okay, we get.
00:42:07.928 - 00:42:09.880, Speaker D: The side of friends coming together. Exactly.
00:42:10.730 - 00:42:28.346, Speaker B: It was one of those situations where it was just perfect. But it's been a real pleasure. Thank you guys for having me on the show. I really appreciate the time, as you can tell. I'm happy to ramble on about, um, but I really do appreciate the opportunity.
00:42:28.528 - 00:42:47.540, Speaker A: Our absolute pleasure. I'm going to take over from here and let you guys all skedaddle. I appreciate all of your contributions so much. David, thank you for joining us on a special late night version. Zaji, you and I will take over another time, but until then, Josh, awesome to meet you. We'll talk again soon. We'll do a follow up, but have a great night, you guys.
00:42:47.540 - 00:43:05.426, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. That was a cool session. Little late night moonbeam with our friends in the moonlight from Chainlink Labs, from Mintrest. Thank you for being here. Thank you for the good questions. Blank, blank. I saw your question and we kind of covered some of that at the beginning.
00:43:05.426 - 00:43:29.646, Speaker A: So you can go back and review that or do one better. Head down to the description and find the links out to the discord to mintrust and just go ask there. We want to encourage people to join those communities. That's what. Therefore, we're just a little running short on time, so I didn't want to keep everybody for too long. But hey, while you're joining their community, you can always also join the chainlink communities. Discord, telegram, all that good stuff is also down there.
00:43:29.646 - 00:43:56.114, Speaker A: You can follow chainlink for official updates on at chainlink for updates on these cool sessions, which we usually do during the day, but they're available on YouTube all the time. You can find those at smart underscore contract. You can follow me at Andy Boyen if you want some dad jokes and, like, random stuff. I did a tweet about birds tonight. Now everybody's talking about birds on my timeline. I never should have done it. But you can get dumb stuff like that for me if you want as well, like and subscribe to this video so more people see it and learn about these cool projects.
00:43:56.114 - 00:44:10.654, Speaker A: And you catch more of these. Oh, man. Thank you so much for hanging out with me. You're welcome. Begbang and thank you, Wayne, for those good questions as well. And those of you who came over from the base space, recognize little chain link love there. All right, everybody, we'll see you guys next time.
00:44:10.654 - 00:44:26.090, Speaker A: I think it's next week. On Monday, we're interviewing depot, which is a defi protocol. And then I got something special in the works for next Tuesday, maybe a little bit later this week. But we got some celebrity guests I got to hang out with, and I'll bring you guys that. All right, peace. See you next time on Chainlink.
