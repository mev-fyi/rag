00:00:06.170 - 00:00:41.660, Speaker A: I know that both of you also work a lot on using blockchain to help deliver electricity to the developing world and to help fund projects, sustainable energy projects in the developing world, particularly sub Saharan Africa. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the work that you're doing on the developing world and how you think blockchain might actually help deliver energy and perhaps financial resources to build energy or to create energy in the developing world, particularly sub Saharan Africa, if you'd like, or other parts of the developing world.
00:00:46.990 - 00:00:50.490, Speaker B: While I gather my thoughts, I don't know if you can just say something.
00:00:50.640 - 00:00:57.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this question is for both of. I mean, if either of you have any thoughts about that, I'd be very interested in hearing them.
00:00:57.476 - 00:01:51.402, Speaker C: So, look, essentially, like I said, there's been this trajectory. Myself and Connor worked together about three years at this point, maybe a bit less, like I say, starting with these fairly narrow pieces around hedging and kind of inspired. We're working here in UCD in Ireland, inspired by the operation of the irish electricity market that I'm most familiar with and kind of gradually building out to say, okay, is this a case of I'm just financially hedging my risk exposure? How does that become, like, I'm pre selling energy, how does that become. I'm pre selling ownership. So all the things kind of come together in this nexus, right? That it's financing and it's forward selling and it's hedging. It's all sort of the same thing. And you suddenly go, okay, well, when you're writing a smart contract, like what I said earlier, what is the appropriate metaphor or label? I mean, a smart contract handles wealth according to algorithmic rules.
00:01:51.402 - 00:03:12.854, Speaker C: So you set your rules and we can decide, is that ownership or financing or hedging? And maybe it's all three. And so it's kind of coming out of that mindset of saying, okay, maybe there's a financing piece to this. And often you would hope the killer application for blockchain is in lower trust environments or when, for some institutional reason, there's a hill that really should have solar cells on it. The hill is in the right place, and the sun shines, and it is physically, in engineering terms, a good investment, a proper opportunity. But to say, well, is there an institutional or is there a factor with banking or something that's going to stop people providing the funds to physically procure the hardware, do the capital works and build that, get it connected to the grid? And so Ola Kunde kind of, we wrote that up, framing it, saying maybe those institutional barriers may be more acute in developing economies where the banking system mightn't have as good access to capital. There could be issues with the legal system in terms of how fast moving it is. So I think that's kind of just, we were trying to make this point of saying financing and preselling and hedging, they can all be sort of packaged together into the same offering in terms of a smart contract.
00:03:12.854 - 00:03:24.358, Speaker C: And maybe you can make a strong argument for that in countries that should have a lot of renewable energy but sort of don't. And to say, is there an institutional gap there that we can mean? Does that align with the way you do it?
00:03:24.384 - 00:03:41.138, Speaker B: Ola Konlai okay, so I'll speak from another angle also, just to also buttress your point. So for me, the project started as the project's funded by the irish government.
00:03:41.224 - 00:03:45.570, Speaker D: And in a way, how I for.
00:03:45.640 - 00:03:52.978, Speaker B: It at the start was developing blockchain financial instruments that would accelerate renewable electricity.
00:03:53.154 - 00:03:58.262, Speaker D: In mainly Ireland and say, the rest of Europe.
00:03:58.406 - 00:05:16.734, Speaker B: But as the project progressed, I saw other opportunities, other pressing problems that blockchains could address, particularly in the african electricity markets. So it's a bit personal for me because I've worked in the african power sector for about three, four years now. And in terms of default risk, which is default or counterparty credit risk, which is the possibility of a party, which is, for instance, if you're a buyer, then the counterparty seller defaulting on payment agreements, I think I've mixed that up a bit. But essentially Africa has a low default risk compared to the rest of Europe. But it's still very hard for banks to finance african power projects because of why they say these products have a high cost of capital. And this high cost of capital in a way mirrors default risk. So if a country has a high default risk, then it would in turn have a high cost of capital.
00:05:16.734 - 00:05:21.314, Speaker B: But this, for me didn't make much sense.
00:05:21.432 - 00:05:26.718, Speaker D: So I just went back and looked.
00:05:26.744 - 00:05:37.390, Speaker B: At how my research could address this. And one very important area was the aspect of decentralizing access to finance. So instead of having these big banks.
00:05:37.490 - 00:05:41.754, Speaker D: That could say they are taking on.
00:05:41.792 - 00:07:22.690, Speaker B: All the credit risk when they finance projects and continents, why don't we open up finance to different potential investors with different abilities to invest in project in terms of the council of money they can contribute and their risk appetites, why don't you just open it up and allow different people to be able to do their own due diligence? First, we are decentralizing this risk instead of concentrating it to distribute banks, which means that the cost of capital automatically becomes lower and the exposures become lower. So we are lowering the interest rates, which means the people that would eventually benefit from these fiscal connections would pay like low prices. And also the people that are investing in this project, they wouldn't have had access to such investment opportunities, but because of the distributed nature of blockchains, they can contribute into these projects. So essentially, we're just removing the power from these big banks and giving it to the people, both from the demand side and the supply side. And we potentially believe that this would be beneficial for both the decentralized investors and the people that will be using the power that will be generated from these projects.
