00:00:00.570 - 00:00:40.066, Speaker A: You. So as a multinational, you're going to have many different counterparties coming to you in many different environments. There's going to be derivative specific chains, equity specific chains, trade finance specific chains, and then that's even going to vary based on geography. So in each geography, you might have a different flavor of those vertically focused chains. And this means that banks will need to integrate with many different public, private and consortium chains in order to conduct the transactions that they're used to conducting outside of them. This scope and size of integration, while keeping in mind that you need security while doing them, is really the problem. And that's the problem that we solve.
00:00:40.066 - 00:01:11.260, Speaker A: So the problem that we solve is how does a bank or any enterprise, any multinational enterprise, securely and efficiently integrate with hundreds of different chains with, without having additional security concerns, and while being able to use their existing engineering kind of resources and their existing back end and even their existing APIs and messaging systems. So I think the big limiting factor is integration and secure integration, which is what we spend a lot of time and a lot of late nights working on.
