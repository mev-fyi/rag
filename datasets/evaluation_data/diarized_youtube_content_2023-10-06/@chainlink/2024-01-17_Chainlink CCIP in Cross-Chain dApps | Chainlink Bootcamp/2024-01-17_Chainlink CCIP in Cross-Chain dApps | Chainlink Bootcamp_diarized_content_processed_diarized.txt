00:00:00.330 - 00:00:19.040, Speaker A: You. Hello. Hello. Welcome everyone. We are here today, session seven from our chain link boot camp. The total will be ten sessions. So we have this and three more days.
00:00:19.040 - 00:00:51.980, Speaker A: And today is the second day that we are talking about CCIP, the cross chain interoperability protocol. And today we are doing this with NFTs. Yesterday we learned about NFTs, and today we are doing cross chain NFTs. This is really amazing. So let's go to our pet. Let's start in the pet to have you here. The people is already coming.
00:00:51.980 - 00:01:36.710, Speaker A: I share my screen. Welcome everyone. And you saw that I asked something different today. If you'd like to share some network of your social network with our friends here or our colleagues in the boot camp, feel free to do it. Let's get some minutes to you. And remember that we are not on pad six, we are on pad seven. All the sessions are here in the same place that you did the subscription to the boot camp.
00:01:36.710 - 00:02:12.748, Speaker A: You registered here. And then if you scroll down, you can see the link of our session. So if you go to some pet session, let's go to the day four, you can see what's happened. Okay? And we are here now, day seven. If you try to go to the day that we didn't happen yesterday, you'll be waiting. And this is all the sessions are here. Okay, what more? Remember to join our discord.
00:02:12.748 - 00:02:43.930, Speaker A: We have a channel to the boot camp. And over there you can talk about, you can help your friends, you can ask for help. We have a lot of amazing people over there that is helping. And I really appreciate this. Hey, so good, Darby, you are here. Dabi is a developer expert. He's here to help us a bit.
00:02:43.930 - 00:03:27.118, Speaker A: And Tatiana, welcome. Tatiana is a community manager, like Jeff and Javier, that you know a bit about them. And good to see you here as well. And what more? For now, remember that our slides are here. So in a few minutes I will start this presentation with you and the task form. I already added the new tasks for today I can't open because I need to do a login that I'm not doing now. But we have four tasks today.
00:03:27.118 - 00:04:09.160, Speaker A: Today is the day that I'm not talk so much. It's not so many slides, but this is a huge practical day, because we are creating three different smart content. And I go in a slow down mode to be sure that you are not being lost in the middle. Okay? And Gabrielle, you are welcome. Okay. And let's see if you need some help with the faucet. And today we are using both faucets sepoli and Fuji.
00:04:09.160 - 00:04:50.250, Speaker A: But only get some token over there if you really need it. Because let's share this with everyone. And I know that you need the password. So let's get the password for you. What is this here? This is the password line 18 and 19. Probably we don't have nothing here now. Yes, so are you send something to our class now.
00:04:50.250 - 00:05:32.808, Speaker A: So if we have 150.5, we should have fifth sepolia. Let's send this. Oh, I am on a vaccine now. So let's go to Sepolia and fund our faucet for today. And also I must send some link. Not sepula now.
00:05:32.808 - 00:05:54.530, Speaker A: Link token. Let's send five. I need more link. But the link. You can try to get in the official faucet as well. So it's using some minutes you have. It is on Sepolia Ioad on Fuji as well.
00:05:54.530 - 00:06:31.010, Speaker A: Let's go to Fuji and. Oh, I don't have so much now. I must send only a bit and help your friends. Because I'm running out of talking now. A bit of this. A bit of link as well. Pink.
00:06:31.010 - 00:07:08.046, Speaker A: Let's see what happened here. So today we need five links and a bit 0.5 on each or less. Like 10% of this is good. Now if you don't have it, let's try to share with your friends. Okay, let's see how we are here. Okay, we have a lot of people.
00:07:08.046 - 00:07:29.846, Speaker A: Welcome everyone. Let's add a divider here and. Okay, we don't need the source of this. We can get only here. Yes. Great. A lot of people here.
00:07:29.846 - 00:07:57.150, Speaker A: Amazing. So I think I can start now. We are here on session seven today. And let's talk about cross chain NFts and chain link CCIp. But today it's a session related to messages. Not tokens, not erc. 20 tokens.
00:07:57.150 - 00:08:27.606, Speaker A: This is the pad we are read over there. Let's talk about what's a message. We can think about an arbitrary message. Like send any arbitrary data. This will be encoded as bytes. You are receiving as much content on a different blockchain. One point that you must pay attention here is that when you are sending messages.
00:08:27.606 - 00:08:51.746, Speaker A: You cannot send them to a normal wallet. Because the wallet cannot handle this. So when you talk about messages, the messages must be sent to another. There is much content in the destination chain. But when you think about a message. I can send a message like a hello word. This is good.
00:08:51.746 - 00:09:34.878, Speaker A: But I also can send something like a comment to another. Is much content like I'd like to call a function in another smart context and we are doing this today. And imagine that you can even encode multiple instructions in a single message. And then you can enable a way to orchestrate a complex multi step or multi chain tasks. So this can be so huge. And yes, we have more than one developer expert here today. Lucas are here as well.
00:09:34.878 - 00:10:42.954, Speaker A: Welcome guys, thank you for your help. And now let's go forward. When we talk about the arbitrary messaging, imagine that you can use this to trigger an informant action on the receiver. Receiving as much content in the destination chain like it is rebalancing an index or minting a specific NFT. We are doing this today or updated a state of a game or calling an arbitrary function, any function with the same information as custom parameters. Today we are doing this, we are minting an NFT. But we are sending extra parameter saying that this NFT is coming from other like when hang out messages.
00:10:42.954 - 00:11:42.290, Speaker A: I can think about the program token transfers. I told you that today. I'm not using a token approach, but you can later study how to combine this. Combine the token transfer with the messages so you can simultaneously transfer tokens and arbitrary data in a single transaction. And this kind of mechanism, you allow you to transfer the tokens and send the instructors cal functions in a way that what you'd like to do with the token. You send the token and also you send some messages to telling what you'd like to do with the token. And this is like a new word because remember that tokens, when we cannot transfer tokens directly to another, is much content.
00:11:42.290 - 00:12:38.950, Speaker A: If you send that token to another is much content in the same chain. The other contract, the destination contract didn't know that it's receiving a token in order to do this. If you do this using CCIP, using the token pool, yes, you can do this because you can send it to the second chain, the token itself and also some instruction. What do I to do with that token? So this is amazing. And this bring it to us an infinite alternative what we can do. And here I have an example for you. A user could transfer tokens to a lending protocol with instructions to leverage those tokens as a collateral for a loan, borrowing another asset and send back to the user.
00:12:38.950 - 00:13:19.150, Speaker A: So this is huge. And this is a complex operation that you can handle on this way. And this is our goal today. What about an NFT that can be minted in one chain from another chain? We are doing this today. And when we talk about this, we are talking about cross chain NFTs. And here I add some cross chain options. One options is exactly what we are doing today.
00:13:19.150 - 00:14:35.942, Speaker A: Mint an NFT from one chain and this NFT will appear in another chain. And I already comment to you that this was the first CCIP workshop when CCIP was launched in Paris July last year on the HCC week. And I did this workshop during the HCC event and this was the first CCIP workshop and I'm so proud of this. But also I can have different ideas with the NFTs with the cross chain options. Another I can have the same NFTs in many chains, but then I must manage this in which chain? This NFT is active now. Or maybe can I have an attribute activating one chain and another attribute activving another chain? Maybe you can think about it so you can think about different metadata attributes like different status, different color. Today I'm doing something like this.
00:14:35.942 - 00:15:32.046, Speaker A: We are having different colors in our NFT. And also I can tell you that we have a different information as well. But we are minting the NFT with these different attributes. And this is our project. Today we are doing a cross chain nFT emoji based on the BTC price. And remember yesterday that I told you that we could do the created NFT in different ways, create the image in different ways. So today the image is an SVG and also today the json file will be built on chain directly in your smash context.
00:15:32.046 - 00:16:28.490, Speaker A: So I can tell you that today it's a complex NFT. And remember that we start from zero for beginners and day by day we are adding new concepts, some complexity on this until the last day of our boot camp. And this is my goal. I will tell you that it has not been like this now because on Sepolia the price is not updated so frequently. So I did a lot and out of them I like this because the price didn't change. But this is our goal. For example, if the background is blue, this NFT was minted on Sepolia.
00:16:28.490 - 00:17:10.310, Speaker A: If the backy ground is red was minted on Fuji. And I'm not using Mumbai today. But I already did this on Mumbai in another workshop. And if I'm doing this from Mumbai, the background polygon is purple. Also if the price of the NFT didn't change, if I compare with the last time that I minted the NFT, the moji, it's this facing. Nothing happened. If the price goes up after the last time, I'm so happy.
00:17:10.310 - 00:17:36.686, Speaker A: But if the price went down, okay, I'm sad. And this is. So I'm combining a cross chain nft with the data prices that you learned last week. And it's not thank you yet. Let's go to the hands on part. So let's do it. Great.
00:17:36.686 - 00:18:10.940, Speaker A: Let's set this down. And this is my limit with you. Let's close this. Let's see where I must go now. Oh, this is one that I was testing 1 hour ago, I think half an hour ago. And like I told you, I did a lot of tests directly on Sepolia. And only the first that was from zero to the first price was happy and all the orders was like nothing happened.
00:18:10.940 - 00:18:45.380, Speaker A: Are you minting one more on this? Now let's see what happened. I have it in another screen. Wait. Okay, let's do this. So we must create three smart contexts. First, the NFT and the NFT will be created on the destination chain Sepolia. Second, the destination minter.
00:18:45.380 - 00:19:10.850, Speaker A: So I have a content on Sepolia that is managing how to mint the NFT. This is the destination minter. Then on the Cersei chain that will be Fuji. We will create the Cersei minter. So we have this tweet. Let's start it here. Let's go.
00:19:10.850 - 00:19:38.200, Speaker A: We are going now. Let's put some instructions for you. Metamask. Go to Sepolia. Go to remix where I am. I must take some of this and create. Let's get the name of our first file.
00:19:38.200 - 00:20:18.150, Speaker A: It is crosschainpricenft. So it's not on the GitHub yet. Okay. Are you adding some minutes? And this is our NFT. This is not so complicated. So deploy it and add here the name of your cross chain. Your name and cross chain price Nft address.
00:20:18.150 - 00:20:37.900, Speaker A: Okay, let's do it. I am in the chain with bootcamp. I must first create like you. Let's see if I am Sepolia. Because I have no idea. No, I am on avalanche. So let's go to Sepolia.
00:20:37.900 - 00:21:05.428, Speaker A: Correct this Roma. We are starting on Sepolia. Look here. Metamask Sepolia. Okay, we are starting here and then this is the code. Let's copy from here. Don't cut the code.
00:21:05.428 - 00:21:41.000, Speaker A: Only copy it here until here. Copy it. Let's come here and paste. Yes, I know I can't trust myself. And here is our content. Now I will explain this and deploy this content on Sepolia. And let's explain this first for you.
00:21:41.000 - 00:22:13.330, Speaker A: It's hot here. Let's drink a bite. So like always, license. We are on 0.8.19. This is because some chain link libraries that is working on this version. Okay not working on 21. Oh I didn't pass on 21 in fact.
00:22:13.330 - 00:23:09.060, Speaker A: So let's be sure that we are in a trust version. You can see here that I am importing the libraries related to the open zeppelin but this is important. This basic 64 you be used to create all the information of the NFT on chain. And here you can see that my NFT is related to the data feeds. So I can have here the aggregator interface. This is the crosschain NfT I'm importing the libraries from open Zeppelin and you can see here that I'm using strings, the strings library and I have the aggregator interface. That's the price fit.
00:23:09.060 - 00:24:20.358, Speaker A: I'm getting the last price and save here and this is the emoji. So I have the indicator of price up, price down, price flat and this is the price indicator that I'm using now. And I create a new struct inside my NfT to handle the cross chain part. So for each chain I have the code of chain and where I got this code I'm using this from the supported networks. So if I have the code anamia and a color, okay the background color and I create a mapping with a number that I decide the number and a chain structure. This is my chain. So is this my NST colored cross chain price cc price and in the cost structure I'm initializing the chains.
00:24:20.358 - 00:25:12.714, Speaker A: Chain zero will be sepolia. So this is the destination chain on Sepolia I got this here sepolia testnet chain selector. This is what I'm using here name is Sepolia. I decided this naming I could put it in Sepolia wherever I decided only to use sepolia and this is the color that I'm using. You saw the color over there, the blue color and I create a new more oh you can see now that I just did this and the bitc price was down and let's go back here. So the sepole is blue. Now I have another item on my array, my stretch list.
00:25:12.714 - 00:25:38.146, Speaker A: That is the Fuji. This is the chain selector that I got from here. Fuji. I'm using this, I will use this to be the chain and also the color will be red. Name it Fuji. And I did on Mumbai last year. So I have another chain here.
00:25:38.146 - 00:26:12.090, Speaker A: Always the same selector for Mumbai name it that I decided color purple. 1 second. Probably you are not connected on Sepolia. Check it. If you are connected here on sepolia like me I'm not. So if I try to do now I will get the same error of you. Okay, let's connect it.
00:26:12.090 - 00:26:37.964, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you for remembering me that I was not connected. And remember the code. Like I said before, I got the code here from the supported networks. The code is the chain selector. And here is. I'm initializing the price fit.
00:26:37.964 - 00:27:11.660, Speaker A: So I'm using the sepolia BTC USD aggregator. Let's see if this is right. If I'm not on the wrong address, wrong chain can happen. Sepolia BTC USD copy it. This is exactly the same. So this is good. And then I don't need this subsifuji here.
00:27:11.660 - 00:27:46.466, Speaker A: Okay? Because I'm only minting and I am on Sepolia. Let's take it off. For me and for you, you don't need this information because this information is not true. Okay, so what am I doing here? I'm minting an NFT to the creator, to the owner of the content. What is the function? Mint. Because I am on Sepolia. You can see that here I have only the address that I'd like to receive the NFT.
00:27:46.466 - 00:28:15.310, Speaker A: But if you'd like to mint from sepolia. In fact, I'm using this mint from with the address. And from zero. Zero is the Sepolia chain. Remember that we defined it here. Zero, Sepolia. And what is the mint from? This is a function that I created because I'd like to manage who you will receive and what is the service chain.
00:28:15.310 - 00:29:04.046, Speaker A: And like always, we are creating a new NFT. So I must create a new index, a new ID, and use the safety mint of pink zappelin to do this. After this, I'm updating the metadata of my NFT using the source ID and increment the count. What about the update the metadata? What am I doing here? I'm creating an SVG. I'm creating the image life. So let's go to this build SVG first to understand. I think this is done here.
00:29:04.046 - 00:29:29.646, Speaker A: Build SVG. So I'm creating an SVG, an image inside the mysmatch content. This is so cool. So this is the corner, like the background, the hitangle, which are random color. It's not in fact a random color. Now we are using the color defined. This is the head of the SVG.
00:29:29.646 - 00:29:51.280, Speaker A: I'm initializing this. I'm updating the emoji based on the price. So this is the body of my Nft, the SVG. I'm comparing price here. And then I'm closing the SVG out of this. Done. I'm encoding this.
00:29:51.280 - 00:30:35.066, Speaker A: So what is the compare price. This is like we did last week in the session. Number three, the compare price is exactly the same functional effect because I'm getting the chain link data feed. Latest answer and comparing the price like I have the current price. This is the last time that I did. If the price that I have before was if the pricing now is higher, price indicator is up. If the pricing now is down, then is lower than less timing.
00:30:35.066 - 00:30:54.194, Speaker A: The price indicator is down. If it's exactly the name the same, you have the flag. And this is. And the get chain link data fit. Latest answer. We use this in the token shop. But you can see here that I have a new approach to get the information.
00:30:54.194 - 00:31:23.966, Speaker A: Okay. Only to understand what I'm doing. And this is like the token that we did yesterday is to get the URL of the information of the token. And I must have this because of solidity. Okay, let's come back. Because we did the build SVG, but we must understand how to create the metadata on chain. It's here.
00:31:23.966 - 00:31:49.410, Speaker A: We was here. We created the image to create the metadata check here. I'm creating a string. This is the JSon string. So I'm using the basic 64 encode. And then I'm encoding the naming of my NFT cross chain price SVG description. SVG.
00:31:49.410 - 00:32:18.378, Speaker A: NFTs in different chains. The image that I'm initializing the image is saying that this is an SVG with XML. It's encoded in base 64. And then I have the bytes of the image that we got here. The SVG is used here. Then I have the attributes. I have two attributes.
00:32:18.378 - 00:33:07.340, Speaker A: The source. This is the name of the source chain and the price. That's the last price that we got in the compare price. So with all of this, I can create the token Uri that is the json file, the metadata of our NFT, and set this. So is this. This one is so amazing because I'm creating an image inside the smatch content. Then I'm creating all the attributes, all the JSOn metadata of the NFT inside.
00:33:07.340 - 00:33:29.672, Speaker A: So this is really amazing. And this is our nft, I think. I didn't create mine. Let's see. Yeah, probably. No, let's create mine. Yeah, I don't have your content here.
00:33:29.672 - 00:33:59.050, Speaker A: So deploy it. Sepalia. I'm good here. Config. I like to drink something. And here we are. I have my Nft now, like you.
00:33:59.050 - 00:34:37.070, Speaker A: Amazing. Congrats, everyone. Oh, you did, Sepalia, perfect. Thank you so much for helping your colleagues. Yeah, guess is high now. Oh, I saw a question here from Vandena that related to your files here Vandana. Probably you did something like if you clear all the cache, maybe you lost all your files.
00:34:37.070 - 00:35:22.398, Speaker A: A tip for later, not for now that you already lost it, but later you can came here to your workspace. Even it's not easy. If they default right button, you can download this. So then you have all of this in your computer. And after you can upload them in another moment. But to get these again, to create each of these, they are here in our boot camp, in the GitHub. So get each of these and create one by one and then remain to access them, you must select the file and use the at address.
00:35:22.398 - 00:35:57.110, Speaker A: You don't need to deploy it again. Okay. And the contents from today are not here yet. You do during the class in a few minutes when I finish. Okay, so with this let's go forward. Oh, again the same guys. Probably you are doing this because you are not on Sepolia.
00:35:57.110 - 00:36:27.202, Speaker A: Maybe this is the problem. If you are here in the remix VM, you have problems. And we are doing the NFG is on Sepolia. Okay, create the NFT. Deploy the NFT on Sepolia. Okay. Then next we must create.
00:36:27.202 - 00:37:16.234, Speaker A: Oh, before that, let's see our Nft on open. Okay, sorry, I thought that I did it. So here. But also it's here. No? Okay, here, line 18. I added the boot camp, the GitHub. Remember that I will create a git book later, probably next week with all the information.
00:37:16.234 - 00:37:45.520, Speaker A: But not now. This is another. Okay for today is this. That is the learn solidity. But we are on this now. Okay, let's go to openc and then I'd like to you to share your collection. And where is mine? I must do it again.
00:37:45.520 - 00:38:23.920, Speaker A: Copy and paste and find it. We are not using this on IPFs. So don't do this. We are not using. You didn't configure this and it is not our focus now. Okay, so this is my collection and I have you one happy face crushing. This is mine.
00:38:23.920 - 00:38:48.370, Speaker A: Let's add here. So add here your collection like I did mine. And kiss for you. Add one of the items of your collection. This is the collection itself. This is yours. So your collection is this.
00:38:48.370 - 00:39:25.270, Speaker A: Yes. You fix it. Fix you, not me. Amazing. Let's give you some minutes. So amazing. Let's give you more time.
00:39:25.270 - 00:40:10.800, Speaker A: Simona. I don't have any more Fuji avalash to send. Now what I have I must use in the other workshops today. So could you add your address and someone could sing the bit to Simona and let's see how we are. Great. So amazing. Guys and girls, here we are.
00:40:10.800 - 00:40:47.268, Speaker A: Let's interact with our NFT. So on. Remix in your match content and go to your cross chain. Go on. And let's do something here. I'd like to explore this a bit with you. For example, let's see what is the last price? This is the last price that we got.
00:40:47.268 - 00:42:09.312, Speaker A: If you compare the price now, maybe it didn't change because the time it is on sepoli used to be higher than other networks. So if I compare price, you get a new one or. No, what I would like to you to do here is like try to mint anyone for you. So who can help Simona? And here, go to mint. So here we are. Are you mint one new for me, get my address, come back to the mix function, add my address and meet. Confirming and.
00:42:09.312 - 00:42:42.488, Speaker A: Okay, it's confirmed here. So if I came here on this, you can see that now I have two happy faces. This is good. So good. Okay, let's still go forward. What we are doing now is creating the second concrete. Thank you.
00:42:42.488 - 00:43:11.770, Speaker A: So I write this part down area. Now let's create the destination minter. The crosschain. Destination minter. Crossdestinationminter. So we must create this like you. So let's do it.
00:43:11.770 - 00:44:12.660, Speaker A: Remix. Create a new file. Cross destination. And let's copy for you and for myself. And this is on sepolia as well. The destination chain ub sepolio. Okay, so here we are.
00:44:12.660 - 00:44:34.810, Speaker A: I will explain this first for you. Or let's deploy. Contact destination. Deploy NFT address. So, let's get my address here. Paste here. This is the parameter to mint this.
00:44:34.810 - 00:45:25.834, Speaker A: To deploy this. Confirming. Okay, now I have here a second context. That is the destination mint copy paste here for you. So, naming and cross chain destination minter address. Let's explain this for you before that. Yes.
00:45:25.834 - 00:46:03.188, Speaker A: And then you can get all the contact address from iteriscam and Hikover remix. So some options related to the address. One iteration. Second, if you added them in our previous pets every day, you have over there. Third option. If you already filled the task form, you have them over there. And after this, like Lucas said, here.
00:46:03.188 - 00:46:48.712, Speaker A: Then if you have the address, you can get the address and use the ET address, not deploy. Okay, I must explain this for you now. Wait a minute. Here we are. Remember, the cross destination winter will be deployed on sepolia. And this is so important to you. This is the content that will receive the message from CCIP from the outer.
00:46:48.712 - 00:47:48.056, Speaker A: Okay. In order to do this, this contract must have, this must import the CCIP receiver. So the destination contract must import the CCIP receiver. And also because the CCIP service has some libraries, some custom structures, structures, I must have the client here as well to import this here you can see that I have an interface that's the minter. Okay. And this is the interface to interact with my NFT. But I don't need to have all the functions from my NFT, I use only the mint function.
00:47:48.056 - 00:48:39.260, Speaker A: So I create an interface here where I declare only the mint with the parameters. So what I specify here came from here. Mint from. It's exactly this. But if it's public here in the interface is external. Okay, let's see something guys, be sure that here you have the cross destination minter selected. Okay.
00:48:39.260 - 00:49:09.356, Speaker A: It's default to be sure before deploy. Let's continue. So you can see that my content cross destination minter is SAP receiver. It's importing the CCP receiver. I have the NFT. I have an event if I mint this successful. Now I need to use the howter of Sepolia.
00:49:09.356 - 00:50:06.506, Speaker A: This is the smart content from CCIP on Sepolia. This is the outer where I got this. And let's see if this is right here we are supported networks a bit slow now. Okay we are on Testnet, the last version of Testnet and Sepolia. The how to is this a 59 the how to is a 59 outboard here. So this is the constructor inside the constructor I'm initializing with the NFT address and I'm initializing the CCAP receiver with the sepolia hauter. And here we are.
00:50:06.506 - 00:51:11.680, Speaker A: Like I said before, I'm importing the CCAP receiver because I must have this function inside my content, the underscore CCIP receive and this function you handle the message that the CCIP, the CCIP service you send to me using the howuter. And this is the messaging. So I must have this structure, any two evme message that I imported from the client and on this message I will use this message on my NFT. So this is the address of my NFT. And wherever the message that I'm receiving I'm calling this message inside the NFT. In fact what is the message? I have another here. The message will be here.
00:51:11.680 - 00:51:48.874, Speaker A: So my Nft you receive this mint from address and chain selector. And this will be from the message sender with the chain iD. And here I'm using sepolia because I am inside Sepolia. But when I came in from Fuji. This number will be different. But this is the point. My NFT is calling the instructions that I have inside this message.
00:51:48.874 - 00:52:18.790, Speaker A: This is really amazing. And then if this is successful, I will meet the mute the event. Because I'd like to be sure that this is working. I have some functions to test this locally. Locally means in the same network. First is test mint. So I'm doing the NFT mint from zero because I am on Sepolia here.
00:52:18.790 - 00:52:42.250, Speaker A: This content is deployed on Sepolia. And also I did this to test my message. And it's the same. I create a message here. You can see that the message is encoded. My message is this mint from address number. The parameters are the same there and zero.
00:52:42.250 - 00:53:02.546, Speaker A: Because I'm in Sepolia. Be careful here. If you add space here, you not work anymore. Once I have like 4 hours because of this problem. So don't do this. I'm saving your time. And this is.
00:53:02.546 - 00:53:31.142, Speaker A: I will call the NFT with the message. You can see that here that I'm testing message. I'm doing exactly the same that the CCAP receiver will do. And here I'm testing the same chain. Okay. And if you'd like to do this with other NFT, you can like sometimes I did something wrong with my NFT. I must change the NFT.
00:53:31.142 - 00:54:07.030, Speaker A: Then I change it here. Okay, let's see how are our messages now. I saw some messages related to the gas. When I'm deploying this, I don't change nothing related to gaz on metamask. Okay. You used to not do this well, James, I think you can start here now. You can learn everything.
00:54:07.030 - 00:54:40.476, Speaker A: If you are not a developer, you must use more time. Your effort to be a bit more than the others to understand basics of programming lawshkis. But you can do this. I try to do in a way that everyone can do. Even if you are not a developer. If you know how to copy and paste, you can do this. But like I told you in the beginning of this course, if you are not a developer, you must study more for duties.
00:54:40.476 - 00:55:17.852, Speaker A: You cannot be a developer on ten days. But this is like the path that you can study. I think this material that I'm sharing with you, you can easily pass six months studying this. And even if you are a developer and are coming to the web3 space, it's a bit fast than if you are not a developer. But also you need more time to practice this. What's happening in the future when we finish this, is that everything is working here. When you copy and paste almost working.
00:55:17.852 - 00:55:42.010, Speaker A: I know. But when you try later and you try to change some parameters, some information, you're not working. Like you must study it more to make this working. And this is normal. It's your learning path. Okay. And yes, Jimal, this is amazing.
00:55:42.010 - 00:56:14.124, Speaker A: You are only watching the class now and doing coding offline. This is good as well because I know that it's hard, especially if you have only one screen. Like to see the YouTube video, to see the pad and to go to remix or wherever we must go in the same time. It's so crazy. So I know that sometimes it's better to watch now and do when we finish, we try to do this. This is so learning. So nerve.
00:56:14.124 - 00:56:37.770, Speaker A: Okay. And thank you for this. This is good as well. And okay, now we have the destination minter. Let's test it. Amazing. I'm so proud of you.
00:56:37.770 - 00:57:05.570, Speaker A: My students are so amazing. So what we are doing now, first here on the cross, destination minter. You will do the test mint. And then the test message. Test mint. Test message. Let's do the test.
00:57:05.570 - 00:58:13.020, Speaker A: For me, it's like impossible to have only one screen even when I'm traveling, that I travel a lot, to events, to do, workshops, live in person. And I have a second portable screen to go with me because I know that I cannot use when I'm coding in an event live. But I must use this on my room in different cities around the test means should appear a new NFT here. And it's too blue because we are only on sepulche now. And yes, and you can see that now the price didn't change. Let's go to one of these. Let's see this.
00:58:13.020 - 00:58:41.586, Speaker A: Wow. I don't have a triple screen. I must test this. Kisford. Great idea. The deploy input is. Let's understand what is saying here when you try to deploy, it's saying that you must add the address of your NFT.
00:58:41.586 - 00:59:12.650, Speaker A: NFT address. So added the address of your NFT and let's come back here. This is the last one that I minted now. And if I come here, I saw the price. This is probably the same price from the last one. This is the last one before. So the price here is the same here we are on Sepolia.
00:59:12.650 - 00:59:46.534, Speaker A: Take a look in the attributes. And if I compare with the first that I minted, the price here, it's a bit slow. Then the price a bit low than the price here. So the price was up. So good. This is good until now. Let's mint one more now using the mint message the test message.
00:59:46.534 - 01:00:29.268, Speaker A: Because I'd like to be sure that I have the message as well. And guys related to the faucet. I'm doing my best to fund our workshop faucet Altimi. But take a look in the chaining faucet as well and help you. And you can add your wallet address down in the pad. And someone can help you now. Okay.
01:00:29.268 - 01:00:49.184, Speaker A: But try the official house at first please. Here we are. So let's see. Oh. Now my transaction is confirmed. Should appear a new one. Okay.
01:00:49.184 - 01:01:05.080, Speaker A: Too flat. Too happy. We are good. Our blue. Because we are on Sepolia. Now we are ready to go to Fuji. Let's go to Fuji.
01:01:05.080 - 01:01:37.110, Speaker A: Let's come here. How do you get the NFT collection address? The NFG collection address is the address of your cross chain nft that you did here. This is the address of your collection. The address of this match content. Okay. And create now important. So important.
01:01:37.110 - 01:02:05.500, Speaker A: Metamask. Go to Valentine. It's hard today. Fuji. Okay. Let's go. I used to ask you to do this and I forgot.
01:02:05.500 - 01:02:45.810, Speaker A: So now I am on avalanche fish. Let's go forward on remix create. Let's get the last file cross. Here we are. And then begin. End. I need to create it.
01:02:45.810 - 01:03:05.700, Speaker A: Second icon file Explorer. Create a new file carousel. Look at this. If I don't add the extension the dot saw you be added in automatically way. Okay. But should be shared. Here we are.
01:03:05.700 - 01:03:51.030, Speaker A: Cross minter. Let's get the code for you and for me. So this is for you. This is for me. And then let's understand the deploy. In order to deploy the parameter is the address the destination Minteradis. Okay.
01:03:51.030 - 01:04:12.904, Speaker A: Let's do this. And then you can add here your name and your cross symmetries. Let's do it. Remix. Get the cross destination minter address. Copy it. Here.
01:04:12.904 - 01:04:41.840, Speaker A: Go to my cross C minter. Paste the address and deploy. Remember that I am on Avax Fuji now. Okay. This is the address. Let's come here. Amazing.
01:04:41.840 - 01:05:05.380, Speaker A: You are so fast. I'm so proud when my students is faster than me. This is really amazing. Okay. I must explain this coach for you as well. Let's drink a bit more and I show you something. Wait.
01:05:05.380 - 01:05:33.754, Speaker A: You know that I am in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I'm based here. And like I am in a new house that I'm renovating. But my house is not done yet. So I'm not in my perfect environment now. I don't have my air conditioned yet. So I have a lot of fans around me.
01:05:33.754 - 01:06:24.826, Speaker A: But take a look in the temperature now 31 degrees Celsius. This is so hot. Okay, let's go to our code. Remember, deploy this on Fuji. And you can see here that I have the interface of the client, the outer itself. Also I'm using the library of the CCP because of the structures that I need. And I'm using the link token interface because remember that I must pay fees and I'm paying fees on the Cersei blockchain.
01:06:24.826 - 01:07:21.210, Speaker A: So I will pay fees here using the link token and hey Kisford, are you in Colorado? See you in Denver. Are you being Denver in one month and five weeks? I think so. This is the cross minter. And you can see that I'm hanging some ahors. Like if I don't have enough balance to execute the transaction or if at the end I like to withdraw what I have in my content, the link that I have in my content, I can do this. If I don't have nothing, I will have this effort. Okay, here we are declaring some things like the outer, the link token, the destination chain, the owner and the destination minter.
01:07:21.210 - 01:07:55.510, Speaker A: We have this event message sent with the message and in the constructor. Remember that we are sending the destination minter address. We are defining the owner because only the owner can withdraw the tokens. And remember that all this information are in this CCIP supported networks. And we are on Fuji. So this is from Fuji. So I need to have the Howta address on Fuji.
01:07:55.510 - 01:09:04.084, Speaker A: Would you like to get it to confirm? Here we are Fuji testnet Fuji how to address 8177-8177 award. So here I'm initializing the Howtech link token is the same link that we are using here. OKay, the link that I have here is the same address. But to be easy for you, if I go here, you can see that the support fit tokens can be using link. We have this here and this is the same that I have here. And I'm also approving to the Hauter ON Fuji to expand my Tokens to pay the fees. OKay, we are going to Sepolia.
01:09:04.084 - 01:10:03.790, Speaker A: So the destination chain selector is Sepolia. I already show you this, but if I came here in the supported networks and find Sepolia, I can see the change selector here. And this is the change selector that I'm using here. And the destination minter, this is my contract, my destination minter that I already deployed on Sepalia. This is the contract that will receive the message. Then we have this ImportaNt Function here, the Mint on Sepolia. And remember that the mint is from Fuji network and if you come back to the cross chain NFT the Fuji network is here, chain one Fuji and here is that I'm using here.
01:10:03.790 - 01:11:39.470, Speaker A: So creating the message you have the structure that I got the structure from the client, the TCP client, EVM to any messaging I'm creating this structure now, this messaging and what is the information that I can have this receiver, this is the destination minter. The content that you receive, the message, the data, this is what you are sending to this contract. This is the same message that I tested here. Remember that I tested this. So this I'm using here in the cross cersei minter mint from address bu the cersei chain now is not zero because I am on Fuji so it's from one token amount it's zero because I'm not sending tokens only the message now and extra arguments because I know that this is a bit complex that only a transfer I'm using the maximum gas limit. This is the maximum that I can get it and probably I can see here in some place as well. Fuji to sepolia the cap city of everything.
01:11:39.470 - 01:12:20.824, Speaker A: No, I don't have the gas limit here. Okay so it's here using this gas limit and fee token. Remember that I may pay fees using the link token. So here I have the address of the link token like we did when we transferring tokens. First of all we are using the outer to calculate the fees to us. Sometimes can happen that this must be calculated later. But this is the fee that the destination network needs now.
01:12:20.824 - 01:13:48.578, Speaker A: So I must say who is the destination chain selector with this message? How much are you paid to do this? And then I'm checking if I have enough link inside my contract. So you can see here that we must send the link to this contract later and if I don't have it I revert with this. Then when I'm sending this to the network, the CCIP is returning a message ID for me and here you can see that I'm sending the message using the outer calling the CCIP send function to the destination chain. Destination chain selector with my message. And here I have the modifier only owner only to be sure that only the owner can withdraw the link that remain the content if you'd like to do this later. And sometimes my students have problems that they forgot to add the link to fund the content with link. So to have your life easier I created the link balance here and can be to any account.
01:13:48.578 - 01:14:35.366, Speaker A: So check the balance of this account directly here and like I said before, remember that you use this code and you test it. But if you'd like to get the link back to using next exercise, withdraw the link that you have here. Okay, perfect. Did you deploy it? Yes, we deploy it. So after deploy it, what we must do. I think this is some approaches with talkings. And maybe in the future we have yudits.
01:14:35.366 - 01:15:23.392, Speaker A: But this is only approach. Okay, it's some strategies. Next you must go to metamask and send five link to your content to your cross search. Remember, on metamask on Fuji NGD. Let's do it. Let's get the address of my contact again. It's here.
01:15:23.392 - 01:16:10.670, Speaker A: Copy. Go to metamask tokens, select the link token. Send. Here we are. Five links. And next, confirming how good. Now after this, go to the link balance remix on your content.
01:16:10.670 - 01:16:59.902, Speaker A: How the function link balance. So using the linky balance with the cross Minter address should return something like you do. Now let's see. So this is the address of my content. Linky balance should hit any. This is equal to five elite. How good.
01:16:59.902 - 01:17:56.968, Speaker A: Now, are you prepared to do your cross chain mint token? Let's see. Philippi, I don't know what transaction are you doing. But if you are trying to do the mint on Sepolia before send tokens, it is a problem. Okay, I miss Sepolia. Did you reload the remix? Try to reload the remix. Try to be sure that you are okay you are on Sepolia. But be sure that in the environment here you are on injected provider and copy and paste the code again.
01:17:56.968 - 01:18:29.296, Speaker A: Maybe someone takes some part of the code. Okay. And I must update these as well. So we are doing the mint on Sepolia and then I update it live to solve some ducts. So yes, Lindsay, we are ready to do the Minto Sepolia to mint in another chain. Let's go. Minto Sepolia.
01:18:29.296 - 01:19:32.270, Speaker A: Here I am. Mint an NFt from Fuji to Sepoya. Mint of sepoya. And then you can add here for me the naming and your transaction ID. Let's do it. Confirm. Let's get their address, the transaction ID.
01:19:32.270 - 01:20:22.280, Speaker A: So copy transaction Id on Metamask. Click on your transaction copy transaction ID. In this way I can get the ID and add it here. Congrats, guys. Amazing. And now let's go to the CCP explorer. Another divider here.
01:20:22.280 - 01:20:45.006, Speaker A: This is really amazing. Let's go a bit now. So here we are. A lot of people creating your cross chain transaction. Your cross chain. NFT. This is amazing.
01:20:45.006 - 01:21:26.410, Speaker A: I'm so happy. So let's review this part. One more time. So what you did, we created the crosschain service minter on Sepolia. Remember that? So I came here to deploy, I added the parameter is the address of the destination minter that I did on Sepolia. Now I am on Fuji on the cross cerseimenter. And then here I add the address, deploy it.
01:21:26.410 - 01:21:55.540, Speaker A: Here we are. Then I sent on Metamask to the address of my contact. I sent to the address five link. This is not the address. Wait. On metamask I came into talkings link sent to the address of my contact five links. I will not do this again, but do this.
01:21:55.540 - 01:22:36.814, Speaker A: Then I check the link balance of my content. So copy the contact address paste here, check the linky balance. You can see that I had five link, but now I have only 4.41. It means that my transaction I think is done. And after this, I made sure that I have this. I did the mint on Sepolia and with the mint on Sepolia, transaction that I'm here. Activity, contact, interaction.
01:22:36.814 - 01:23:04.180, Speaker A: This is the mint on Sepolia. I copied the transaction iD. First of all, share with you have this. So amazing. So here the transaction idol, transaction id. Out of this we have it. So amazing.
01:23:04.180 - 01:23:42.460, Speaker A: And now we must go to the CCAP explorer. So let's get my transaction id again here metamask, click on transaction copy transaction ID, go to the CCAP Explorer and search for your transaction. Search your transaction. You can see that it's blessed. It's going well. When this is success, we can come back to our NFT collection on openc. Let's wait a bit.
01:23:42.460 - 01:24:48.158, Speaker A: Means that the first transaction is done. We could understand a bit of each. Let's see if I have this here. Easy for you. What is this? What is this? Limits. Okay. This is like a long process, but since, oh, it's now that are the steps of this like self finalized, committed, blessed and success.
01:24:48.158 - 01:25:30.500, Speaker A: Yes, this is done. So let's come back to our NFT collection and see. I must have now an NFT with a red background and I don't know the price. Yes, here we are. The price didn't change since the last time that we came here. But you can see that this was minted from Fuji. If I open this Nft, the search is Fuji.
01:25:30.500 - 01:26:22.724, Speaker A: Okay, let's explain the Minton sepolia again a bit more. Remember Minton Sepolia on Minton Sepolia. I'm creating CCAP messaging. This is the structure of your messaging. And on this message I'm defining everything. The receiver you be there's much content on the destination chain on Sepolia that is prepared to receive my message. So my destination content must have the CCP receive function.
01:26:22.724 - 01:27:11.616, Speaker A: This is prepared to receive my message on Sepolia and on Fuji. I'm sending to that contact. Okay data. I can add any kind of information. If I add here some hello words I can but my goal is to send the function that will be colored by the NFT. So I'm expecting that my NfT call this function mint from and the mint from is from the address that I'm defining here. This is the parameter and the search is one where is this one? This one was defined on my NFT.
01:27:11.616 - 01:28:05.480, Speaker A: The chain one is Fuji and the mint from is on my NFT as well because it's here the mint from q service id and okay, I defined the message. This is the token amount. We are not sending tokens now. And it's important to increase the gas limit in order to do this. So when I'm sending the transaction, I'm sending this gas limit where you can check this. Let's go to metamask and open my transaction on Fuji block explorer. And here you can see some details.
01:28:05.480 - 01:28:43.060, Speaker A: And here was the method that I call it. Okay, this is what I did. Okay, come back here then. Remember that I'm paying fees on the surface so the mint will happen on sepolia. But I'm paying fees on Fuji. I'm paying fees using the link token. Remember that you must define the address of the link that you are paying fees.
01:28:43.060 - 01:29:24.450, Speaker A: Then I'm calculating the fees in order to check if I have enough to do this. So the outer on Fuji is getting the fee based on the destination chain and my message. And I'm checking if the fees are higher than the amount of link that I have here. If it is, it's reverting. So send more links to your content. And if not the hauter is sending the transaction to the CCAP network and I got the message ID. Okay.
01:29:24.450 - 01:30:13.330, Speaker A: Okay is this, this was a review of the Mintyong sepolia. And if I try to do this again I make sure that I can't because if you saw here for example, I spent 2.58 link and now I have only 2.41. So probably I must send more link to do this again. And now I will answer some questions from you. And also I know that I must update this. So I'm updating this in the other screen just now.
01:30:13.330 - 01:30:48.540, Speaker A: Okay, if you'd like to see this you can. Let's only add a bit of order here. So this is the content that we did yesterday. I must do in the other screen because I must copy and paste. So let's create all of this on my GitHub. Yeah. You do this manually and then answer your questions.
01:30:48.540 - 01:31:21.298, Speaker A: Process minter the price. I'm missing some questions. Wait a minute. Great. Let's answer your questions. We have a. Oh, great.
01:31:21.298 - 01:31:35.960, Speaker A: Rema, you got them. Amazing. Ntz. I think he was talking about the data session on the messages. So we talk about this. This is the information that I did. Okay, I explain.
01:31:35.960 - 01:32:30.602, Speaker A: Yes, Alex, you can automate, but you must have disappointing another account, but you can do this. So amazing one. John, Elizabeth didn't use our discord group because we have your channel over there to help you. If you send a message directly to me related to the boot camp or in fact related to anything now probably I will answer in one month, because it's hard on this moment. So let's get the support of the other colleagues here. Okay, on the group. And where can you see the message? The message is here.
01:32:30.602 - 01:33:28.988, Speaker A: Like this is the message and this is the message that we send on the cross chain. And the message you be executed here in the CCAP receiver. This is receiving the message and calling on the must young. You must have the CCAP deployed on this private chain, so it's not so open. Depends of the chain. Okay, I didn't understand your comment, Tom, what will be the overall steps from Sequoia to Fuji? Yes. So if you'd like to do the opposite.
01:33:28.988 - 01:34:05.724, Speaker A: First on the cross minter you must add the address of if it is sepolia. Here it be Sepolia inverted everything here and here. And here. You can do this. It's a good exercise, in fact. And are you doing our GitHub? For now, you can try to check it and see the video. But are you doing this later on the gitbook? Probably.
01:34:05.724 - 01:34:38.680, Speaker A: Vandana, check if you have enough link inside your content. Okay, probably this. And yes, we must wait at least four minutes, sometimes more. And yes, you must check the CCP explorer. Great. Wondering so what more. Yes.
01:34:38.680 - 01:35:03.770, Speaker A: Remember that here we don't have any space inside the message. If you have one here, it will be a problem. Let's see if our content is too, right. Maybe someone change it, I don't know. No, it's good. It's our concept. It's so good.
01:35:03.770 - 01:35:39.892, Speaker A: Okay, seems not bad. And let's try to finish the code to you. So cross destination. I'm updating the git hub. Now cross nft copy it. I did this, right? Yes. Cross minter at control C.
01:35:39.892 - 01:35:56.780, Speaker A: At control Z. Pay out. Oh no. I did this wrong. Cross destination. I'm copying the wrong place. Cross destination meter is this.
01:35:56.780 - 01:36:22.080, Speaker A: Let's check it. Cross destination meter outboot. So save and close. Nft this. Save and close. Process cylinder. Save and close.
01:36:22.080 - 01:36:38.242, Speaker A: Check at everything. Crushing link price. I know that you are not seeing my screen. I'm here. Okay. Let's see if I did this way. Crossingpricenft saw.
01:36:38.242 - 01:37:09.500, Speaker A: Yes, it's right. Crossachelectioming is good. Cross minter is good. All good. So now I must upload this for you. And if you have more questions I may hear around you. Answer where I am changing boot camp here.
01:37:09.500 - 01:37:52.730, Speaker A: Like this is not a diverse class. So I'm not doing everything with you. But if you'd like to see how I am, my GitHub like this is the service of them. So git add everything that is changed and git for me. You don't need to do this. Okay. My message is session NSch messaging and then git push.
01:37:52.730 - 01:38:28.574, Speaker A: And these three files you appear in a few minutes. Now if we go here is that our codes are here now. Okay. CCP message. Let's see if you have some depth over there. Yes. If you'd like to mint from polygon you can create the destination minter.
01:38:28.574 - 01:38:54.720, Speaker A: You not change. This is not so difficult. I'm not doing this now because we must have tokens on Mumbai. But if you use the semi cross search and change here the outer. You'll be the Mumbai outer. And also change the howuter change the link token. Didn't change nothing here.
01:38:54.720 - 01:39:11.410, Speaker A: Only change the search. And you can do this on Mumbai. Vandana, I'd like to see your transaction. Oh okay. You got the success. Yes. Congrats, Vandana.
01:39:11.410 - 01:39:41.954, Speaker A: So is this for today? I think mint test. Ehore we. We don't have any information with this. Sorry. We cannot understand this. Oh, I love this, guys. I really love this.
01:39:41.954 - 01:40:09.124, Speaker A: You think that you need on sepali but you have it. And yes, if you try to get something that sepal is too much. And this is amazing. I don't know who are you, but you first check this. I love this. Okay. I have some time now I'm doing a demonstration with you.
01:40:09.124 - 01:40:34.620, Speaker A: Okay. I'm not expecting that you do this with me. Okay. So I'm doing from Mumbai. But if you don't have tokens on Mumbai, I will not have it now. So let's do this. I will create a new one across from Mumbai.
01:40:34.620 - 01:41:04.600, Speaker A: This is a demo now. I'm not expecting to you to do with me. Cross Mumbai. And I'm copying this and I can share the code with you later. Let's finish. Deploy this on Mumbai. What mode I must change.
01:41:04.600 - 01:41:36.594, Speaker A: I must change here. Let's get this testnet. Less testnet. So we are on Mumbai. Now. The howter is this? So let's open the hauter. And I'd like to change here because now is the outer address.
01:41:36.594 - 01:42:04.226, Speaker A: Mumbai. And here I'm using this. Where is the link token on Mumbai. So you know that I came here, got the link token here. And I'm updating here. So I must approve the house. Not the Fuji, but the Mumbai.
01:42:04.226 - 01:42:32.420, Speaker A: How good here, I'm going to Sepole. So it's not changing over there. Mint on Sepolia, but mint from Mumbai network to be chain two. Where I got this here, you can see that I created this. Chain two, Mumbai. I define this. Here.
01:42:32.420 - 01:42:59.818, Speaker A: Surf simter Mumbai. Let's see here the surface two, not one. Now I think it's only this. Yes, this is enough. Okay, now I must go to Mumbai. I share this with you. I deleted this because you cannot help you now.
01:42:59.818 - 01:43:24.898, Speaker A: Sorry. So this is a challenge for you from Mumbai. So Metamask Mumbai. And I didn't have in Mumbai on my metamask. Now. Oh, I have it. I don't know.
01:43:24.898 - 01:44:08.100, Speaker A: Let's see. No, I don't. So let's go to chainlist art and testnet Mumbai. Here we are. So add Mumbai, metamask. Being on Mumbai, I didn't. So let's add to metamask.
01:44:08.100 - 01:44:37.324, Speaker A: Hey, aikin, nice you. And I think about this probably for next boot camp. Okay, so now I have in Mumbai. And probably I am over there. Yes, I am in Mumbai. I have some link. I don't know if I have some link.
01:44:37.324 - 01:45:12.550, Speaker A: Let's discover. Let's go to the docs. Chain link, chain link and get the link contract link, token contact. And I am on Mumbai. So here we are. Oh, I could get in the order, add to it. Let's make my life easy.
01:45:12.550 - 01:45:54.500, Speaker A: And yes, I have a link. So add link on Mumbai Metamask. And you can see that I did from zero. So let's deploy. I will deploy these, not this. I must be sure that I have on cross subsidy. Minter Mumbai.
01:45:54.500 - 01:46:22.870, Speaker A: The same destination. Minter. I'm deploying on Mumbai now. Okay, here you are. If you'd like to do this, you can do with me adhere your name. Oh, I didn't share the content with you yet. Sorry.
01:46:22.870 - 01:46:49.980, Speaker A: Wait. Because I didn't change the name of the content including let's closer. Cementer Mumbai. Remember that this is a demo. Now on the remix. Create this you can do by yourself. Because this is a challenge.
01:46:49.980 - 01:47:39.390, Speaker A: But I can edit a challenge for you. This is what I did. Now live with you and name me. And now we must add this. If you do so, this is mine. I think I'm done here. Remember that you must fund metamask with five link.
01:47:39.390 - 01:48:06.978, Speaker A: So I told you that this is a demonstration. Because I will not give you tokens. Guys, it's too much for now. You must try to get it. Try the chaining faucet again. Not the workshop faucet, but let's send it here. Send here.
01:48:06.978 - 01:48:26.922, Speaker A: I'm not sending Matik. I might send link five. Next. Confirm. Then let's check my balance. Still zero. Now that was actually confirm it.
01:48:26.922 - 01:48:58.364, Speaker A: Yes, I have five. Minto sepalia. Good luck to me. Confirm. And if you'd like to do this next time, I would like to have this with you. But I was not prepared on this time. If you are doing with me, please add here.
01:48:58.364 - 01:49:20.710, Speaker A: If you do this later. Your CCAP transaction ID. So the mint on sepolia transaction ID. This is mine. You can check mine. Let's go over there. Copy transaction ID.
01:49:20.710 - 01:49:58.348, Speaker A: Go to the CCP explorer search. Waiting for finality. So we're waiting more here. But in fact it's an excellent idea to do two Cersei minters. I like this. I try to do this next time. Okay, Daniel, the destination winter is always the same.
01:49:58.348 - 01:50:12.450, Speaker A: Okay. Because we are sending. We sent from Fuji. Now we are sending from Mumbai. But always going to Sepolia. Okay, so this is the cross chain destination. Maintain address.
01:50:12.450 - 01:50:35.412, Speaker A: But this is a challenge. Now it's difficult because I didn't did the other steps with you. So don't worry if you don't. This now how is this? No, I was not here. Here. Still waiting for finality. The fee.
01:50:35.412 - 01:51:01.886, Speaker A: It is lower than when we did from Fuji. Interesting. Yes, exactly. You must have one contact. You must have two surface contacts. Two separate servicing content. Because they are deployed in different chains.
01:51:01.886 - 01:51:33.386, Speaker A: But they can go to the same destination content on the destination chain. Okay. And I'm not sure if this is not updated yet. Let's wait a bit more. And guys, remember that. Oh wow. We have some people doing here.
01:51:33.386 - 01:52:14.004, Speaker A: Amazing. Congrats everyone. And remember that you can review the section here. If you have problems, go to our discord. We have the boot camp channel for you over there and you can exchange information over there. What more? What happened with the finality here? Maybe we can check if tomorrow this is done. I will check you one more minute.
01:52:14.004 - 01:53:19.090, Speaker A: Okay. And we are almost finishing. Let's remember you to follow the chain link on YouTube as well. Remember to follow us on YouTube. And we are live here almost finishing. And share what you think about our chain mint boot camp. What your achievements with our hashtag chain link bootcamp 2024 like I did here.
01:53:19.090 - 01:53:50.522, Speaker A: And also, I mean like he tweeting some messages from you guys like this and they had here in the wind. It's so funny. But this was in Spanish. This was in Portuguese. This was in Portuguese. English. Oh, here.
01:53:50.522 - 01:54:15.182, Speaker A: This from yesterday from Sartrec. Amazing. Congrats. So I may tweeting the message that you are doing that's related to us. You can follow me as well. Let's connect and remember that all my social networks are the same. Solangeigueros.
01:54:15.182 - 01:54:36.182, Speaker A: If you have a point extra lettering any places. Not me. I didn't ask you money, I didn't offer investments. Oh, finally. Finalize it. Let's wait. I'm curious if this because used to not take so long on Mumbai.
01:54:36.182 - 01:55:02.930, Speaker A: Used to be faster. No, in fact it's long only when we start on Fuji. It's fast. If I starting the orders, this will take like 1015 minutes. Are you not waiting now? Tomorrow you can see this. Okay. Hey, king, we talked about security last week.
01:55:02.930 - 01:55:38.158, Speaker A: So if you come here to the bootcamp. Session four, I think. Yes, session four that I explain the CCAP without the details and sender receiver. How we have one slide only related to the Hiski management network. This is the security part. So go here. Especially this amazing article in our blog related to the five levels of cross chain security.
01:55:38.158 - 01:56:31.734, Speaker A: Okay, I we added this here as well and also adding in the end of the pet. And we are not waiting this because I just forgot that when we start on Fuji on Mumbai, Sepolia can take sometimes 1520 minutes to have the process. So we are not waiting now, but tomorrow you can see our last transaction done. For now we have only this. Oh, I'm so happy. Look at this. So this is success.
01:56:31.734 - 01:56:58.730, Speaker A: Woohoo. Seven minutes on timing. And you can see here we have now a purple came from Mumbai and it said because the bitcoin price went down. Woohoo. Not that the price is down, but woohoo. That we did this. I'm so happy and this is a great way to finish our session.
01:56:58.730 - 01:57:10.030, Speaker A: Congrats to everyone that did it. So amazing. I'm closing the session now and see you tomorrow. Bye.
