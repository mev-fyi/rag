00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.302, Speaker A: The winners. And I think this is absolutely true of Chainlink. They have better technology, as you said, and it scales better. That's, I'm now speaking as a computer scientist. You've got to get the architecture right so you can go from ten users to 10 million users. And most of the systems that you all collectively, and this is not a comment about Chainlink, it's about others seem to fall over reasonably quickly. Right.
00:00:27.302 - 00:00:45.140, Speaker A: That's my observation. They're just not built to scale yet. You can't do it in six months. It takes real computer science, real planning, real platforms. I think chain link, because of the way you're going to provide compute services, and I'll just use the generic word trust services will become a key component of that.
