00:00:09.370 - 00:00:37.986, Speaker A: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another chainlink Q A. My name is rory. Today we are joined by the graph protocol. Tegan Klein and Dave Cashpust here will be joining us. They'll introduce themselves just shortly. First off, though, I want to thank everybody for the graph protocol community, the chain link and the wider blockchain community for joining us today. Again, the goal of this Q and A is really just to allow the community to learn more about the integration between the graph and chainlink, exploring what makes this kind of unique, beneficial to both teams.
00:00:37.986 - 00:01:07.982, Speaker A: And again, all the cool things that graph is currently doing. The agenda will be about 20 to 30 minutes. It'll be a standard Q and a structure, and at the bottom of the video description you'll see kind of all the links and sort of relevant information. So if you want to continue and find more sort of deep dive into this stuff, you're more than welcome to. And if you have any questions, we'll have all our social channels for both the graph and chainlink and you can hop in and ask us any questions. So without further ado, Tegan, if you wouldn't mind maybe introducing yourself, kind of what your role is and sort of what you do at the graph.
00:01:08.126 - 00:01:36.700, Speaker B: Absolutely. Thank you so much for hosting us. So, I am Tegan Klein. I am the business lead, and my background kind of started in centralized finance, so I was in investment banking at bank of America, sales and trading at Barclays. So definitely kind of went through my hazing and then I joined a distributed VPN backed by Andreessen, Horace and Sequoia, helped bring them to market, ran business for them for over a year, and now I am focused fully on the graph. I've been with the graph for almost a year now.
00:01:37.470 - 00:01:40.140, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, David. How about yourself?
00:01:41.390 - 00:02:01.170, Speaker C: Yeah. Hey, guys, I'm a researcher and developer at the graph and I've been working in crypto for about three years doing that, and most of that time has been at the graph. And before that I've been at a few other previous companies, and in general I work on the smart contracts as well as blockchain research and economic research and statistics for our own protocol.
00:02:02.470 - 00:02:16.440, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks again, David and Tegan, for joining us today. David, I'll throw it to you first. What is the graph? Kind of, in your own words, sort of as a developer, what is the graph? What does it do? Why are people so interested in this technology?
00:02:18.430 - 00:02:40.990, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So the graph is a decentralized network and it's for basically an indexing and querying protocol that powers many of the applications in web3 today. Think about it like an API that makes it easy for developers to build on blockchains. What Google does for the web, the graph does for blockchains.
00:02:42.130 - 00:02:48.338, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. No, that's a great explanation. Tegan, how about yourself? Anything else you want to add or sort of build on that?
00:02:48.424 - 00:03:17.850, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I love that analogy with Google. I think it makes it really easy for folks to kind of understand what the graph does. So the graph has kind of become the backbone of DFI and the broader web3 ecosystem. And what we do is we make it easy for developers to access data from the blockchain and bring that data to their users on their applications. And so one of our community members actually made the analogy like control F is the graph. It's just how you can search the blockchain easily, and so many applications are using us.
00:03:17.850 - 00:03:31.200, Speaker B: So uniswap, synthetics, live, peer balancer, gnosis. Almost every application in the web3 space utilizes the graph because we help them pull data efficiently and easily. And that's all on chain data.
00:03:32.050 - 00:03:46.980, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Yeah, so a real focus here, I think, for everybody on sort of on chain data, I guess. David, maybe throwing it back to you. Can you give me maybe some quick examples of maybe like what type of on chain data someone like a uniswap or some of these other defi protocols might be using you guys for?
00:03:47.910 - 00:04:30.402, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So there's a lot of on chain data that the graph can actually provide. At the kind of simplest level, it can just be data that is actually stored on chain. Kind of like what you would see what your balance is in a uniswap pool, the amount of tokens that you have in any protocol, really. That's a good way to put it, actually. And then what the graph can also do is can start to build this rich kind of data from all the transactions that happen on chain. So you can get like a historical analysis of how funds are flowing through uniswap over time.
00:04:30.402 - 00:04:54.140, Speaker C: And that's actually what the Uniswap subgraph does, is it shows the daily volume, the types of tokens that are being traded, and then you could actually get that in USD or what it just allows you to build. Like, you get the base level, the stuff that's just on Ethereum if you query it yourself. But then you also get the rich data from being able to do all the historical data and querying all that.
00:04:55.070 - 00:05:25.618, Speaker A: No, that's perfect. It makes a lot of sense. I think one of the things without this sort of stack and you guys are a huge part of, I'm assuming a developer would have to build each protocol without something like the graph would have to build this kind of technology for themselves individually, which I'm assuming would be an extremely time consuming and potentially frustrating endeavor, versus with you guys, these sub graphs can essentially be created, and then maybe they can create some of these front end visuals on some of these products and things like that.
00:05:25.704 - 00:06:08.818, Speaker B: That's absolutely right. And the analogy I kind of like to use is like without the graph, these developers have to build out this indexing layer from scratch. And that takes a really long time. It can take a year, three years, it takes a while. And so the analogy I like to use is within the web, it would be like Twitter having to build out an entire database of all this social data and then being able to build this social network on top of that. And so we abstract it all away and make it really easy for developers to build applications and really focus on making really great applications that are competitive with centralized applications. And I think that's really where we'll see a lot of movement from Web two to web3.
00:06:08.984 - 00:06:25.318, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you for that. No, I think that makes things a lot clearer. Speaking of kind of some cool stuff that you guys are doing, you had your main net launch recently, Tega. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that and maybe sort of what's kind of the next thing you guys are working on?
00:06:25.404 - 00:06:25.990, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:26.140 - 00:06:26.406, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:26.428 - 00:06:53.642, Speaker B: So the graph had a hosted service in production for some time, about almost two years. And so we had a lot of development on that. We saw over 3400 subgraphs spin up on that, growing about 50% month over month. But the goal has always been to decentralize the network. And so we launched the decentralized network. Delegation is currently live. Indexing is currently live.
00:06:53.642 - 00:07:17.430, Speaker B: So there's over 100 nodes on the decentralized network. We launched on December 17, and we already have over 1.1 billion GRT tokens staked in the network. And delegation is live. So you can just purchase GRT to secure the network and delegate your stakes to the indexers that do all the technical work. It's just a one click to delegate.
00:07:18.490 - 00:07:41.200, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks so much, I guess. David, a question I'm going to throw to you, and we could say this from the chain link side of things too. It takes a long time to kind of develop and sort of roll out this technology, maybe give people an idea. David, on why does it take a while to kind know, get this stuff it? Why do you need a research layer? And then why do you need developers? Why do all these things have to work together?
00:07:42.130 - 00:08:16.314, Speaker C: Yeah, there's so much to actually think about when we're dealing with this brand new kind of web3 infrastructure. And chain links led the way a lot in the oracle space, for sure. Now we're leading it in the indexing way. And what it is, it's like, first you have to look at the space, the whole entire web3 space, and then start predicting where you think it's going to go. And then you also have to decide, early days, is all this development going to happen on Ethereum? And right now we're seeing a ton of that. But you also got to pay attention. Well, maybe other blockchains are going to start being important as well.
00:08:16.314 - 00:09:01.034, Speaker C: So you're not only paying attention to the technology itself that you want to build, but the ecosystem at large. And then once you start doing it, it's like, well, for the graph how we started it out, it was just like, okay, let's actually be able to index Ethereum data and get this kind of software working. And then we built that layer, right? And then people are like, okay, great, the graph works. And now it's like, how do we make this into a decentralized network? And now we have this network that's live on Ethereum. But there's so much for us to build. The vision of web3, multi, multi year, multi decade and chain link and the graph as well. If you look at our roadmaps for the future, there's just so much that we both still have to build.
00:09:01.034 - 00:09:22.720, Speaker C: And it's so exciting because there's l two things that are coming along. There's just like improving our own protocols for optimizations, right? So it's a fast moving industry where you have to pay attention to what's going on and pick the right problems. And I think there's so many layers to it. That's what it ends up being.
00:09:23.570 - 00:09:56.666, Speaker A: Yeah. If you think of the time wise, obviously, a lot of people focus on DeFi right now because that's what's hot. But that's about a year old, maybe a hair longer, a year and a half. So when you start looking at that, you're like, the graph has been working on this before. There was Defi as we know it today, and Chainlink was working on Oracle stuff before there was DeFi as we know it today. So it's interesting to know you're providing a solution to a real problem. And then, lo and behold, because I think some of this infrastructure starts getting built.
00:09:56.666 - 00:10:17.466, Speaker A: You see these projects being built in much quicker time frames. I mean, I'm talking to teams where they go from the idea phase to production phase, which used to take years, literally. And I'm seeing these teams sometimes weeks, days, and then they're mainly like, well, we're waiting on an audit. Everything works. We got it built as quick. Waiting on audit. We're waiting on these other things.
00:10:17.466 - 00:10:28.354, Speaker A: So it's really cool to see that happen, that it's not the technology, I think, holding people back as much as it is some of the external things that I think everyone still has work to do on it and figure out a way to make it better.
00:10:28.472 - 00:10:49.980, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think it would be safe to say that I don't know if DFI would have happened without the graph and without chain link. I think this infrastructure is so crucial, and it's only the beginning, and we're only going to see more and more innovation built within this ecosystem. And DFI is just a small piece of the web3 ecosystem. So I'm very excited to see kind of what the next wave is.
00:10:50.350 - 00:11:28.534, Speaker A: Yeah, me too. I think this is so funny. I mean, from like 2016, 2017, where ideas were kind of king and then now we've gone into this where it's got to work and it's got to actually provide sort of value, whatever value means to whatever person, it's got to provide some value. And I think now we're at the stage where we're like, okay, these things work. How can we make them faster? How can we make them better? How can we make them more decentralized, censorship resistant? And so I feel like that's kind of our next sort of phase is saying it works, let's make it way better, versus before, where it was just a scramble to, like, can we get this to work?
00:11:28.652 - 00:11:29.320, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:11:30.250 - 00:11:59.518, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, it's kind of transitioning to the next one. So we talked a little bit about kind of on chain and off chain. I know there was a lot of questions. You guys had your main net, and I know I saw a huge influx in your community, which was great. People had a lot of questions about what is Chainlink? What is the graph, how are they the same and how are they different? And so with this one, I think I just really want to take a moment to just kind of talk about that and emphasize on how they kind of work together symbiotically here. So just on the chainlink side of things, Chainlink is really focused on getting off chain data on chain.
00:11:59.518 - 00:12:29.162, Speaker A: So grabbing those things like the price of a stock or a crypto asset which may exist on an exchange provided by a data provider, and figuring out a way to get that into a smart contract. So again, I think we've scratched the surface in terms of what kind of data, really any type of data that's out there, and we're seeing kind of new ideas, but it's really off chain to on chain. And the graph, Tegan, from your perspective, it's kind of on chain and then indexing that on chain data. So a human being can actually understand what the heck's going.
00:12:29.296 - 00:12:52.900, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So basically, the graph does on chain data and brings that on chain data to the rest of the world, where Chainlink does off chain data and brings that to the blockchain. And so we don't do oracles. The graph doesn't do oracles. But because of our partnership with Chainlink, now all of Chainlink's oracle data can be indexed and queried via the graph. And so that's the way it kind of works together.
00:12:53.910 - 00:13:25.578, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's one coin, but kind of two sides of it. And what I've seen from a lot of these, especially DeFi projects in particular, using both of us, I mean, I talked to teams that are using Chainlink for the oracles, using the graph to make sense of this sort of on chain data, and that seems to be accelerating. You guys talked about your growth, and, I mean, it was just sort of talk to one team every now and then. I knew that was using the graph as well, to multiple teams, to now the vast majority of teams I know are kind of using both of our technologies.
00:13:25.754 - 00:13:28.426, Speaker B: Yes. And I think that will only continue to accelerate.
00:13:28.538 - 00:13:56.950, Speaker A: Well, it works. Right. Which is the key fundamental concept of what we're doing here, is that it works. I guess, David, throwing this on to you and kind of talking about sort of the defi stack and maybe getting in a little bit deeper to what we talked to before. Why do you need these tools as a developer to kind of exist prior to maybe building your project in order to be successful? Why do you think now we're seeing these projects turn around so quickly now that some of these tools exist?
00:13:57.610 - 00:15:05.150, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. Even, like, when I got involved in the space three years ago, it would be easy to look at some of the ambitions of these projects and think to yourself, well, how are they going to get there? How are they going to build all this by themselves? And it was really hard to visualize even people who are like serious crypto people there was a discussion, will Dapps ever actually work? And then when you saw how slow Ethereum was, you're just like, this is a really bad ux right now. And of course, you looked at before we had oracles that worked, there was really no on chain pricing. So everybody was trading on whatever, coinbase or something, right? So it's like, okay, what can you actually do on Ethereum? But slowly, over time, these things, chainlink gets built, and then it has a robust infrastructure for oracles. And then some project like synthetics comes along, and then they realize they're like, all right, well, maybe we can actually just use Chainlink. They have this problem solved. It gives, like, a bunch of relief for their developers to focus on their problem, which is a synthetic asset protocol.
00:15:05.150 - 00:15:59.854, Speaker C: Then all of a sudden, something like the graph comes along and starts making it. So you can actually look at blockchain data in an efficient, fast way, have it all indexed, make it much more rich. And then also the synthetics team can also kind of let go of their people who have to focus on indexing all this stuff and focus on the actual protocol itself. So when you get this kind of, like, compacting effect where Chainlink is solving the problem for everybody of oracle, the graph is solving the indexing problem for everybody. And now you have all these groups of people who are smart engineers, smart smart teams, smart business people who want to build something like a synthetic assets protocol or a decentralized exchange, and then they can just focus on that. And then all of a sudden, their speed is so much faster at developing. Whereas before, in 2016, a lot of the teams coming to the table literally were trying to do all this.
00:15:59.854 - 00:16:12.610, Speaker C: So it is just a big team, fragmented, and it's like solving all the problems at once. And it's not as fast as what's happening now, which is with us out there in the world. It's making everybody's job easier.
00:16:13.670 - 00:16:46.974, Speaker A: No, I think that's a great point. And I always think of someone like Amazon, who we think of this juggernaut, but Amazon didn't build the roads. They didn't build the airports. They didn't build this infrastructure. They allowed something like the Internet and technology to tie all these things together. And now we have this massive company. But at the same time, I think a lot of these projects, 2016, 2017, you were building the road, you were trying to build the airport, you were trying to build all that before you could actually even build your decentralized exchange or whatever your product was.
00:16:46.974 - 00:17:05.378, Speaker A: And so it was tough. And I'm so glad to see things are moving quicker. And I still think this is the very beginning. Speaking of the beginning, Tegan, let me throw this to you. Now that some of this is built, what is your prediction? Kind of maybe for the future and sort of the web3 ecosystem, what do you think is going to happen?
00:17:05.544 - 00:17:49.358, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think I come from traditional, centralized finance. I know a lot of brilliant people that also went into centralized finance. They also went to centralized tech companies because there weren't a lot of other options. And what do those smart people find themselves doing? Well, oftentimes they're looking at ads. How do I sell something to someone? How do I monetize people's data? And that's really not the point of the Internet. That's not why the Internet was created. And so I'm really excited for Web three, because now we have the tools through token economies to allow, and this decentralized infrastructure to allow those brilliant developers that are in web two to come over to web3 and build on decentralized infrastructure.
00:17:49.358 - 00:18:21.710, Speaker B: And I think we've seen a lot of that so far. And I think DFI was a great example of this. But like I alluded to earlier, I think that that process is going to happen like a domino effect, and I think there'll be a snowball effect, and there's been a snowball effect into web3 from web two, and I think there's going to be an avalanche kind of coming into the web3 space. So I'm really excited to see all the innovation that continues to happen and for us to kind of flip all of web two onto web3 via the graph, via companies like Chainlink.
00:18:22.050 - 00:18:29.840, Speaker A: Awesome. David, how about yourself? What are you kind of expecting from sort of web two, web3 here in the near future?
00:18:30.610 - 00:19:24.046, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting to be inside of crypto and Web three and see all these things kind of happen at once. And I think if you look at this summer, maybe DFI became prominent in a lot of people's heads, even who are working in the space, who weren't paying attention to it before. And it's like these things all kind of happen at once because you have technologies like Chainlink and the graph that come along, and then a lot of people start using it, and then all of a sudden, a lot of people are able to build protocols and they all interact. Right. So what I imagine is going to happen, we are still really early days. Most of the people who understand web3 are people who are building in the space. And so what I think will happen is we're going to have maybe one, maybe two more of these moments where it's like another kind of really big jump in everybody's realization, like, oh, wow, Web three just made another jump and another jump.
00:19:24.046 - 00:20:06.286, Speaker C: And web two, to me, is very stagnant. It's there. Those big companies, they're monetizing through ads and stuff, and they're making lots of money, but it's a global group of people who are working on different protocols, but really towards the same end. So when I think about the way that that's going to happen, it's like so many people working around the world at different times on different teams, and it's just, to me, it's going to be like, all of a sudden, big, huge steps. Where we see Web three is now it's doing all this, and it's on par with web two. And then all of a sudden, okay, now it's doing things that are better than Web two. And before we know it, I think it'll happen.
00:20:06.286 - 00:20:25.940, Speaker C: It's the kind of thing, it'll just happen in a moment where we all kind of realize it. And maybe not us, but the whole entire world, even people who don't even know what Web three is yet, they're going to start using it and they're just going to say, oh, wow, this is a way better experience for the Internet than what Web two was.
00:20:26.550 - 00:21:01.406, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you bring some good points about that kind of wow moment. Or that, for me, it always happens to where, and I always throw it back to my parents or grandparents or whatever. Whenever they start using some type of web3 application without even realizing that it just works, it's the best thing that's out there, be it a decentralized finance app or a savings app or whatever it is, is. That's how I know. It's kind of like, okay, we've made it that next step, but then there's going to be web four. And so to me, it's like the second you get there and you sort of get that kind of, okay, people get it. People see the value, I feel.
00:21:01.406 - 00:21:07.380, Speaker A: Then there's that next group that's always pushing again and saying, what's the next iteration of this ultimately need to look like?
00:21:08.150 - 00:21:09.940, Speaker C: Yeah, 100%.
00:21:10.790 - 00:21:24.726, Speaker A: Well, as we kind of wrap up, or just recently wrapped up, 2020, I guess. Tegan, I'll throw this to you. What are you maybe most proud of? It could be for yourself or at the graph. Maybe either you or kind of the graph team accomplished this year that you.
00:21:24.748 - 00:21:26.866, Speaker C: Look back on yeah, I mean, there's.
00:21:26.898 - 00:22:00.110, Speaker B: So much, I think one just kind of being a lean team, building out this protocol. There were about 16 of us that executed on this, and now this community has grown into a community of over 20,000 decentralized folks. I'm excited to continue that decentralization, but also, I think, just like the underdogs, I think the graph was kind of looked at as an underdog. We have been building this for three years, really bootstrapping and grinding, and I've kind of always been an underdog in my life. I grew up in know I always said I was moving to New York City. Everyone said, you're crazy. You're not going to be able to make it to New York City.
00:22:00.110 - 00:22:39.742, Speaker B: Made it to New York City, but I went to a state school, brute college, I was in honors there, said, you want to be able to make it into investment banking at a bulge bracket. I made it into investment banking at a bulge bracket. And it's just kind of like been this story and even just in crypto, I'm sure a lot of the audience members resonate with this because a lot of people called us crazy for believing in bitcoin, Chainlink, ethereum, the graph. But here we are, we made the right bets, and I think the graph made that right bet on decentralization, and a lot of people criticized that. A lot of people wanted us to go the centralized route and we pushed through when people didn't believe in it. It's only now that people are seeing that potential three years later. So I'm excited to kind of continue that on.
00:22:39.742 - 00:22:47.090, Speaker B: And obviously, there are a lot more centralized players that still don't believe, so I'm excited to turn them all into believers.
00:22:47.990 - 00:22:54.020, Speaker A: Absolutely. One day at a time. David, how about yourself, 2020? Looking back, what are you most proud of?
00:22:54.790 - 00:23:31.342, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. What I'm most proud of is watching the team come together in the last three, four months. I've worked with the team for about two and a half years, and everybody's always been, it's like a group of a plus players. And I've worked at a bunch of different companies in my life, and I've never been at a company where you can rely on everybody so much. There was so much work to do in the last three months with the token sale and the network launch, and it's kind of like there was no room for somebody to screw up. Like if somebody said they were going to have to get it done, they would have to get it done. And of course, everybody did.
00:23:31.342 - 00:23:59.270, Speaker C: And it was kind of amazing to see it all come together a week before the launch, I could tell we were going to make it and it was going to go smoothly just because there was so much preparation. And that's a good feeling to have. You don't want to be there a week before and being like, I don't know if it's going to happen. So it was good that I had that feeling, even though it was still, like, high stress. We got it done and it went well. And I've never worked with such a great team before.
00:23:59.420 - 00:24:10.220, Speaker B: I'll double click on that, too. I think everyone at the graph, everyone is values aligned. We believe in this movement and it's just really nice to work with nice people.
00:24:11.390 - 00:24:36.290, Speaker A: Great. I think it's key. And all the challenges with COVID and working remotely and people not seeing each other and to be able to put something together and have it work with all of those things happening I think is pretty amazing. So congratulations to you on that. If people want to continue to follow the progress, what is the best kind of way to do that? What are the communities they need to be part of? From the graph site?
00:24:36.440 - 00:24:49.858, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can follow the graph, Twitter, it's called graph protocol. We also have a telegram channel. I can share all the links with you. For all of our social media, we have discord, YouTube, everything. So I'll share those so you can include them in the show notes.
00:24:50.034 - 00:25:02.086, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Well, I just want to say, Tegan, thank you so much for joining us. David, thank you so much for joining us as well. It's been a real pleasure. I'm looking forward to following your progress. We'll have all the links to, again, all those social channels.
00:25:02.086 - 00:25:15.070, Speaker A: So if you're watching this, definitely make sure to join. A lot of cool things happening. I always tell everybody, I don't think you realize the graph is being used by a lot of these projects. Maybe a lot more than people realize. So stay tuned. I'm sure there'll be a lot of cool stuff coming. Thank you again.
00:25:15.070 - 00:25:22.990, Speaker A: Certainly hope that 2021 is a little bit brighter than 2020 and definitely looking forward to kind of making that happen and pushing that through.
00:25:23.140 - 00:25:24.934, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having us.
00:25:25.092 - 00:25:26.262, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you guys.
00:25:26.396 - 00:25:27.140, Speaker A: Appreciate it so much.
