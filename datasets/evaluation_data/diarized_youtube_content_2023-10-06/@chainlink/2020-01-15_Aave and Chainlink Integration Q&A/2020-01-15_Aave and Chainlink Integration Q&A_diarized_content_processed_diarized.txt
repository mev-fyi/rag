00:00:00.570 - 00:00:00.878, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:00:00.964 - 00:00:49.322, Speaker B: So first thing is, I want to thank both, of course, the Ave team chainlink and the blockchain community for joining us today. In addition, I want to especially thank Emilo Andre for joining us, Johann as well, on the call and kind of taking the time and everybody's busy schedules to make this happen. The community really appreciates these. And so, again, thank you very much for doing that. The overall goal for this Q A is really to allow the community just to learn more about the integration between Aave and chain link, exploring kind of what makes this integration unique and beneficial for both the teams and even the users of each product. So the brief kind of agenda for the first 20 to 25 minutes, we're going to have kind of a Q and a fireside chat structure while I'll be asking questions, allowing both the Ave team and Johann to respond. And then we're going to leave about ten to 15 minutes for kind of the community questions which they've sort of been asking on the pigeonhole app.
00:00:49.322 - 00:01:21.030, Speaker B: We'll be sharing those links as well in the live stream. If for some reason your questions community don't get answered, by all means reach out via Reddit, reach out via Telegram. I'll have all those links provided for you and we'll do our best to answer that question if for some reason that we do miss it. So kind of, that being said, we'll start with sort of some brief introductions. So with the Emilo and Andre, if you wouldn't mind just kind of maybe sharing a little bit about what you do for Ave and maybe just sort of a brief background about maybe kind of how you got involved in sort of crypto and what you guys are doing currently.
00:01:21.180 - 00:02:39.646, Speaker A: Absolutely. So, first of all, like I was saying before, thank you very much, Rory, for having us today. Thanks, Juan, for being here. It was really a pleasure to work with Joan and the whole chain link team, and we are really satisfied of how the integration is going and how the whole process of working with, collaborate with you guys went from the beginning. So what is Abe, what we are building and how we brought this to life? Abe is basically a company that was previously called Italyn. We kicked off the company with an ICO in 2017. It's funny because we kind of kicked off the whole d five space in some way because Italy was live, like, in early 2017, and it was the first platform in which people was allowed to lend and borrow in a decentralized way was kind of different compared to what we built right now.
00:02:39.646 - 00:03:29.834, Speaker A: It was peer to peer. So basically, back in the days there was the possibility for people to create a loan request with a certain collateral, and that loan request would be matched with an offer from a lender. And so there was kind of this peer to peer relationship between the borrower and the lender. For us, it's always kind of interesting to look back to those days, because 2017, there was no die, there were no stable coins. The only stable coins was USDT, and it was on the Omni blockchain. Right now, most of the USDT has migrated to the Ethereum blockchain. And on our platform, people was using one functionality that we built back in the days, it was called ETH pegging.
00:03:29.834 - 00:04:32.322, Speaker A: So basically, people was actually borrowing ETH, and the amount of ETH was pegged to USD. So whenever the borrower would repay the loan, he would repay an equivalent amount of ETh of the amount of USD that he borrowed. So there were no stable coins. So the only way to allow people to borrow a stable amount of USD was to actually calculate peg the price of the loan to the value of ETH. After that, of course, kind of. In 2018, the whole DFI space exploded in some way. At the root of the DeFi, there is like Dai, that is the decentralized stablecoin, and the whole space growed with the concept of money markets, which is what we actually built right now.
00:04:32.322 - 00:05:19.214, Speaker A: So what Ave is, is like a platform where users can go and deposit their assets. So they can deposit stable coins, they can deposit their ERC 20, like link, for example, or like die. And what they are allowed to do is that they can borrow against those assets at the same time, taking these assets from a kind of reserve where all the liquidity goes, basically. So the liquidity is always available instantaneously to be borrowed out. And people who provides liquidity earns a kind of passive income from the interest that is paid from the lenders.
00:05:19.262 - 00:05:19.666, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:19.768 - 00:06:55.962, Speaker A: What we brought in DeFI that was not there before is we have a lot of new functionalities. We were discussing a lot with yon and the chain link team that other platforms don't have, that hopefully, when they will go full force, will give us a real competitive advantage compared to the competition. One that is kind of the most talked about functionality is called flesh loans. So one of the things that we thought when we were building this functionality is that one of the things that would be cool to have is that giving the possibility to people to reuse the collateral. Reuse the collateral is one of the hardest things that you can do, basically, because the collateral is illiquid by definition, you cannot move a collateral outside of the system. Otherwise the whole system becomes under collateralized and it kind of loses its purpose, right? But what we actually thought is that we could allow, for example, leveraging the composability of the DeFi and the Ethereum blockchain. What we allow to do is for developers, is that developers can actually access the liquidity on our platform as long and use the liquidity in whatever way they want within the context of one transaction, with the condition that at the end of the transaction the same liquidity plus a fees is returned.
00:06:55.962 - 00:08:33.182, Speaker A: Otherwise the transaction gets rewarded. What this means is that we allow people to build on top of our protocol tools that mostly target high frequency training, trading, for example, arbitrage, liquidation bots, or even like functionalities like savers. For example, you can write a functionality that allows people to save their cdps, for example, when they are about to get liquidated. You can take the liquidity out of our protocol, close your position, take the collateral, sell it and repay the difference to the pool and save yourself, for example, 13%. That is the liquidation penalty that you pay on maker, right? I mean, there are a lot of different possibilities that this tool opens up for developers. And what it brings to the protocol is that by using the flesh loan, the fee that gets paid by the users of the flesh loan gets redistributed to the depositors. So actually the depositor earn not only from the borrowers borrowing in an overclateralized fashion from the protocol, but also from the flesh loan, which is a different source of income that is 100% safe and is 100% under collateralized, but kind of allows the collateral and the funds to be reused in a different way.
00:08:33.182 - 00:09:34.398, Speaker A: It's something that no other platform has. Another cool thing that we introduced is for people who is familiar with compound and with the DSR, chai and tokenization models of the deposits. Compound has like tokenization model of the deposit. So whenever someone deposits Dai, for example, in compound, he gets in exchange derivative token that is called c token or CDI in the case of Dai, right? And this c token is a representation of the amount that has been deposited by the user plus the accrued interest. So the way it works is that each CDI has an exchange rate compared to the underlying asset. And this exchange rate grows all the time. So CDAI's accrues value and becomes like accrues value compared to die.
00:09:34.398 - 00:10:27.174, Speaker A: So that when you go to redeem your CDI for die, you get more die in the end, which are the interest that the user is accruing. What we actually implemented is a tokenization model that is different than this one. What it allows us to do is that when a user goes on our platform and deposits DaI in the same fashion as compound, for example, or other platforms, he gets derivative tokens that we called Adai. The biggest difference between Adai and CDI is that AdaI is not accumulating the interest in an exchange rate, but is actually growing in balance. So when you deposit 1000 die, you get 1000 Adai, right? And as time passes, you will get 100.1, 100.2, 100.3.
00:10:27.174 - 00:10:35.058, Speaker A: It's like the interest that is increasing all the time. It translates in increase in balance of a die.
00:10:35.154 - 00:10:41.434, Speaker D: And you can simply look on metamask, for example, on your change. You don't need to go to any complex platform to do that.
00:10:41.472 - 00:11:31.930, Speaker A: Yeah, and what this allows to do might seem really simple. People at beginning might think like what is the big deal on that? Actually, it's really interesting because having a tokenization model built this way allows basically people to reuse the a die. Since one AdI is always worth one die, you can potentially exchange one die for one Adai. So you can actually create. Is it possible? We are already having our initial integrations of Adai in different platforms. You can actually always exchange one die with one Adai. Which means, for example, if I need to pay someone, let's say three die, I can pay him with three Adai as well.
00:11:31.930 - 00:11:36.666, Speaker A: With CDI, this is something that doesn't, I mean, you can do that, but.
00:11:36.688 - 00:11:43.662, Speaker D: It'S not changing all the time. And you cannot pay exact amount, you pay a bit less or a bit more.
00:11:43.716 - 00:12:30.714, Speaker A: Exactly. Since the interest rate and exchange rate are increasing all the time, right. When you are trying to pay with CDI, the moment that you are paying, you are already not paying the exact amount that you decided to pay, but you are paying more because even during the time that the transaction is mining, your exchange rate is increasing. So compared to the underlying asset, you are actually paying more than what you agreed before with Adai, this doesn't happen. So if I agree to pay you three die, when the transaction is mined, I will have paid three die to you and the interest accrued will remain in my wallet, which is a huge difference. It might seem very simple, but it's a huge difference. I mean, also there are other functionalities.
00:12:30.714 - 00:13:17.594, Speaker A: I will not go otherwise I will never finish the talking. But we introduce a different interest rate model compared to other platforms, which we call stable rate. We introduce rate switching between variable interest rate and stable interest rate for borrowers we support. Also, thanks to the support to the integration with chiling, 16 different currencies including SUSD, SNX, link and USDT, many different stable coins. And yeah, until now it's going really well. We have been live not even one week. We have already 2.5
00:13:17.594 - 00:13:34.590, Speaker A: million deposited in our platform of total value. There are like 500, 600k borrowed in total. Everything went really well and we are really happy. Awesome.
00:13:34.660 - 00:13:55.910, Speaker B: Well, congratulations. I know you guys are doing a lot of new and interesting things, and it's kind of nice when they all work the way that they're supposed to. Perfect. So that being said, for those that aren't familiar, obviously Johan's on here quite frequently, but Johan, would you mind just a quick little update on kind of who you are and what you do for Chainlink and maybe what your relationship is on this sort of integrations?
00:13:56.810 - 00:14:20.350, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. First, thank you for organizing all of this. Thank you for the Ave team, for being here. I know you guys are probably super busy with your platform live, and huge congrats. Also, it's been amazing seeing the progress in a week from zero liquidity to 2.5 million. And I was just telling you guys on the last call, every day I wake up, I go to check the liquidity because it's improving so much.
00:14:20.420 - 00:14:25.520, Speaker A: It's actually funny looking, actually much quicker, even during the night sometimes.
00:14:28.470 - 00:14:49.160, Speaker C: It's really amazing. So huge congrats for this one. It's great. Okay, so on my side. Yeah, I started chain link about eight months ago. Now, previously I was in blockchain for around two years working there. And I was interested a bit before also about blockchain and the kind of opportunities there.
00:14:49.160 - 00:15:44.026, Speaker C: So at Chainlink, what we do is basically we go from the premise that the real value of blockchain technology comes when you can access data in a reliable and secure way without having to kind of spin up your own platform, your own protocol, your own network from scratch. Right. Because that's a huge amount of work. It's like saying, I want to create a DAP, so I'm going to create a new blockchain smart contract platform to host my Dap, and then I need Oracle. So I'm going to create a new Oracle network. And if everyone did this stuff their way and created all of this first, we would have no standard and we would also have no space because everyone would be working on creating smart contract platforms and Oracle networks. Right? So yeah, our premise is really, we build Oracle networks, we have a team of 30 people working on these for more than three years now.
00:15:44.026 - 00:16:18.938, Speaker C: And we make sure that people can use them in an easy way. It's transparent, it's secure, and it helps to scale the space. And right now, what we've been doing for many months now is helping. I like to give this comparison with the DeFi space. Crypto has been like a dessert for some time where you were just working and wondering when something was going to happen that people could use, not only think about the future, but also build it and start using it right now. And Defi is really something that gives hope for a lot of people and for myself, too. It's like you found an oasis in this desert.
00:16:18.938 - 00:16:48.720, Speaker C: You found something that people can use, that people are building on, and that's really kind of what's crawling. We see new Defi Dapps coming every day. So we've been trying to support, really, this extension, and being able to work with teams like Ave is really, I mean, it's an example of what we want to do. Right. We want to see new projects like this succeed and see how we can help them by building reliable oracles. Basically, that's the idea.
00:16:49.250 - 00:17:01.060, Speaker B: All right, thank you very much, Johan. That being said, we can kind of go back to the ave team. So why was it important for you to pursue this kind of oracle decentralized oracle network integration? What does it mean for you?
00:17:04.630 - 00:17:55.686, Speaker A: I mean, we've talked about this a lot with Joan, actually here. The decision was, to be honest, not so easy at the beginning, in the sense that when we bootstrapped the idea of having our protocol, the initial idea was to have our kind of homemade oracle solution, because to be honest, it looked simple at the beginning. Right. What do you need to do for anchor? Just fetch a few prices and that's it. Right. But the more we started investigating this concept, the more we realized that it's not that simple. I mean, we already built something in house for Italy back in the days.
00:17:55.686 - 00:18:31.194, Speaker A: But the requirements of a platform like Whitland are completely different of what a platform like the current one needs. And the reason is that the model is completely different. Potentially. A model like in Italy, the peer to peer relationship between borrower and lender made everything easier, was kind of way harder to kind of screw up the entire protocol.
00:18:31.322 - 00:18:50.070, Speaker D: Yeah. It was their own responsibility to update the price and check. Is it everything fine or not? But when we're talking about our protocol, we should care about all of our users. And if one price will be not updated, protocol will lose money on our depositors. As well. And that's very bad.
00:18:50.140 - 00:19:34.254, Speaker A: Yeah. And also the thing is that in a product like Abe, there could be potentially right now there are 2.5 million. End of the year, we aim to have 100 million. So the amount of liquidity available in this kind of protocol gives a completely different meaning to the importance of oracles in this solution. So when we started investigating, like what should we do? How should we build the oracle? A lot of questions arised. I mean, I will not go too much in detail because of course you are the kind of the ogs of the decentralized oracle solution.
00:19:34.254 - 00:21:00.042, Speaker A: So I don't need to teach you anything, of course, but just for our audience, a lot of different point of frictions are involved in building an oracle solution. Price discovery, securing oracles, providing mechanism to avoid malicious behavior of the entities who provide oracles. Allow price discovery to your users, like easy, what is needed to do for users. They need to be able at any time to see and monitor what are the prices injected into the protocol, sorry, into the oracle. And also more importantly, guarantee the safety of the protocol by guaranteeing that the correct collateralization ratios and liquidations are present at any time during the whole lifetime of the protocol. So when we started investigating more like in depth these kind of issues, we realized that one of the reason is that we simply don't have the bandwidth in terms of workforce to do that on our side right now. And that is one of the reasons.
00:21:00.042 - 00:22:36.318, Speaker A: So we would have probably needed to sacrifice effort on the actual product to build an oracle solution that actually, at the end of the day, wouldn't have needed to be maintained, updated and secured progressively as the protocol grows. That was one of the first. Then another reason was how do we secure these oracles? How we guarantee that the actors involved in submitting the prices are acting correctly and not trying to maliciously compromise the health of the protocol. This is another big problem. At the beginning, we thought about staking, slashing of the stakes, but also it's very complex. How do you decide how big the stake needs to be? How do you decide? How do you slash the stake if someone is behaving maliciously? How do you actually decide if someone is behaving maliciously or is an issue, for example, price discovery, or there is an issue somewhere else? So at the end of the day, we decided, okay, what can we do to simplify our life? And the best thing we could think of was like, let's contact chainlink and see what we can came up about. And the end result was quite good to be honest.
00:22:36.484 - 00:22:54.740, Speaker D: Yeah, but the main point that the market is changing so fast and we should be competitive. And when we spend in the time on the products which we not really need to spend, it's very bad because we cannot deliver in time the good product. But with the chain link it's completely.
00:22:56.150 - 00:23:42.286, Speaker A: Also another thing is for a protocol like ours, it's really important that the oracle is as decentralized as possible because if you have decentralized protocol, but you have a centralized oracle, then you have a centralized protocol. It's that simple. If you can manipulate the prices that are submitted in the oracle, then you can manipulate your protocol. So your protocol is centralized. There is no objection about mean. We took a sheet of paper, put the pros and the cons and the pros were way more than the cons. So we went for the Chinalink collaboration.
00:23:42.398 - 00:23:44.260, Speaker D: Actually, I don't remember cons.
00:23:45.990 - 00:23:48.642, Speaker A: Maybe there were no. Awesome.
00:23:48.696 - 00:24:05.340, Speaker B: Well, yeah, thank you guys for sharing kind of your thought process. I know our community especially is very interested in why you choose to go with one solution over the other. So thank you for providing such a detailed explanation. Johan, kind of throwing it back into your corner. Why does it make sense for chainlink to work with someone like.
00:24:06.590 - 00:24:36.454, Speaker C: Definitely. I mean, this goes back to what I was saying about being able to provide developer tools for people to easily use. Oracle is a developer tool in the end. And basically the network, the way it works is we have node operators, we have users, and we have data providers. Right. And in order for the whole network to work well, you need users to query these node operators and to use the data that node operators provide. Right.
00:24:36.454 - 00:24:54.486, Speaker C: So any user who kind of goes into the chainlink ecosystem, the chainlink network participates in this economy of providing tokens basically to node operators who then are able to kind of sustain and continue running infrastructure for chainlink.
00:24:54.518 - 00:24:54.714, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:54.752 - 00:25:37.830, Speaker C: Because it's pricey to run infrastructure realistically. So the more users we get using this kind of data, the more sustainable the network is. The more sustainable it gets, the more decentralized. And the more decentralized, well, the more secure. So it's some kind of network effect that the more we can grow, the more we can expand, the better it is for the network and the other kind of, we have to support projects like Ave. Right. So there was also kind of this incentive to be able to provide what Ave needed and to kind of help them building what they need, what they need to go live, basically.
00:25:37.830 - 00:25:42.390, Speaker C: So, yeah, those are the reason network effects, it's all about this in crypto.
00:25:42.730 - 00:26:20.406, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, thank you very much. You guys have actually answered quite a few of our kind of preset questions. So what I'm going to do now is kind of throw it to the audience who've been able to ask a few questions on the pigeonhole live app. We'll start with the one that has the most votes here. So I guess this really could be answered by either team, but maybe particularly ave on this one. Is there plans to change the frequency of the calls for the price data? And then how do you determine the appropriate volatility level or the hour daily heartbeat? Could it potentially change over time? So I guess it's really saying, does the frequency of the heartbeat, does it make sense for you now? And could that potentially change over time?
00:26:20.588 - 00:27:09.350, Speaker A: Yeah, we said, like, back in the days when we kick started the collaboration with chiling, we kind of looked at the. I mean, this is not easy matter. Let's start the conversation with this. The reason is that the crypto market is so unpredictable and so volatile that what you would want. Italy would like a price updated every maybe 10th of a second. But we all know that this is impossible because of the barely, because of the confirmation times of the Ethereum blockchain. So you cannot even aim to have such a precise solution.
00:27:09.350 - 00:28:17.180, Speaker A: And this is exactly because of the volatility of the whole market in general, and not only of a specific currency. Then, of course, there are currencies that are more volatile than the others. What we did at the beginning of this collaboration with Johan and the other and Thomas, we kind of evaluated the currencies that we wanted to add on an historical, like, looking at the historical behavior of the price, which I know is not like the perfect solution, but it's the best, I think, that we can do right now. And based on the historical behavior of the currency, we actually have a document on our GitHub, which is the currency risk assessment, where I think we added also the heartbeat of the update of the price. And based on the history of the price volatility, we decided, like, the heartbeat of the specific currencies until now.
00:28:18.990 - 00:28:19.306, Speaker C: Kind.
00:28:19.328 - 00:29:27.954, Speaker A: Of the good thing is that we don't need that high level of precision in this case, because for now, we are not doing any margin trading. The really high precision of the oracle is particularly needed in margin trading, where you potentially need to liquidate, like, four or five times the amount that the user actually deposited. So there is much higher need of better precision of the oracles with the heartbeat that we selected right now for the specific currencies, everything like we are constantly monitoring the protocol. There are already a few liquidation happening on the protocol given the volatility of these last few days, and everything seems to be working as expected. Of course we will. Like you were saying, rory, at the beginning, this is an ongoing process. It's not like we integrate and that's it.
00:29:27.954 - 00:29:51.900, Speaker A: We talk back in one year. We are constantly monitoring the market and how the protocol is behaving. So if the need of adjustments in this sense would arise, we will of course apply the requested required changes.
00:29:52.670 - 00:30:07.626, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you guys for answering that one. I guess this goes back to ave to the next highest one. So is Chainlink's Oracle network a complete solution for you as of now? And if so, or if not, what other features would you like to see added?
00:30:07.658 - 00:32:13.560, Speaker A: Maybe in the kind of we were discussing with Joan right before this call that of course this protocol, it's not kind of the end result of what we are doing. This protocol is the kickstart of what we want to do and what we want to do we were discussing. I think probably there is also in the article that was published on Twitter that the future of DeFi is connected to. There will be the need for sure in the future to have on a protocol like ours potentially different synthetic assets that represent maybe different real life assets like houses, oil or gold or whatever, or inter blockchain assets like bitcoin. Actually we have already WBTC, but still WBTC is not exactly like integrating real bitcoin, but there is EOS, there is litecoin, there is Monero, there is potentially a whole wide variety of different assets that are not on the theorem blockchain. And for sure one of the goals of DeFi in general, but our specific is to bring this market, expand this market as much as possible. And the Oracles and the price discovery in this case is kind of the most critical aspect if you think about it for sure, what we are going to do in the future is expand this collaboration to be able to cover all the potential different assets that we might want to add to our protocol and we want support in the future.
00:32:14.170 - 00:32:30.380, Speaker B: All right, awesome. We just got two more before we wrap up here. So what is the difference between the Ave protocol and Ethland? I know you touched on that just a little bit, but for people that are maybe familiar with know previously, what kind of would you say is the main difference between the two currently?
00:32:30.830 - 00:33:03.800, Speaker D: The main difference that Ethland is the peer to peer completely product. And if you want to make the loan with your friends, it's like completely good, you can simply do that. But if you have special needs, you have special collateral, you want to borrow, for example, just $50, but on the market you see only $20 options, then it's very hard to manage and hard to find the match in your case. But on lending pool, every borrower starts borrowing money when he.
00:33:06.730 - 00:33:08.114, Speaker C: Any depositor starts.
00:33:08.162 - 00:33:16.186, Speaker D: Earn money when he just deposited on the protocol. It's very good. And we don't need to wait for the much.
00:33:16.288 - 00:34:33.454, Speaker A: Yeah, let's say that it land was kind of the ebay of loans. We use this metaphor at the beginning a lot like, you could go there, publish your request of a loan, and wait until someone, people was constantly back in the days, browsing the offers of the request of loans, and decide, okay, I like this interest rate, I like these conditions, I will fund this loan. While the protocol that we have right now, it's more like I deposit my asset there and I wait until someone will pay me an interest, and that's it. The thing is that it simplifies the experience a lot. Because one of the biggest problems that we noticed with the users that we had back in the days is that for them, was kind of painful to continuously monitor our marketplace to check. If there were loans, then the borrowers would have. For the borrowers, was impossible to get almost instantaneous loans, because there was always this kind of time frame between the publishing or the advertisement and the lender actually taking the loan.
00:34:33.454 - 00:34:33.906, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:34.008 - 00:34:58.698, Speaker D: And also very important point that when the guy came in with his funds, he tell like, okay, I want to create a loan for the guys with a 5% interest, but it can be not accepted by the market. And he don't know what to set. He can check, like, okay, on Italy right now, average is four, but globally, on the market, it will be different. And with Ave, he don't need to choose.
00:34:58.784 - 00:35:00.954, Speaker A: It's like decided by the market.
00:35:00.992 - 00:35:01.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:01.552 - 00:35:56.814, Speaker A: So let's say that we developed Ave with the idea of simplify, streamline the lending process, okay? So depositors go there and deposit their asset, they get an income. They cannot decide, of course, what to fund like before, but it's way easier, because you just go there and you watch your money grow. And borrowers that need liquidity just go there, they bought their collateral, borrow instantaneously. It's way easier. And why we did that is because with the explosion of Defi, this model, the maker model and compound or other platform kind of killed Italy. There was no market for Italy anymore, because borrowers would just go on compound or open a CDP maker, and that's it. So we needed to find a solution that was more competitive and at the same.
00:35:56.814 - 00:36:11.730, Speaker A: But we didn't want to do a copycat to what was already in the market, but we wanted to try to innovate by adding some features that were not in the market, not present in the market when we released.
00:36:12.310 - 00:36:47.600, Speaker D: Also, we try to introduce more stability for the borrowers because all current solutions on the market, they have a variable rate, and some people want to predict a little bit, like, what they will pay in half of a year, like more or less in the classical world. For sure, our stable rate is not fixed because in crypto, it's not possible to implement right now. But still, if it will be no crazy fluctuation on the market, the borrower can predict that he will pay the amount what he should.
00:36:48.530 - 00:36:59.300, Speaker B: All right, perfect. Johan, I'll throw this one to you, but both teams can certainly answer. So, Johan, what is the most exciting aspect of DeFi currently for you right now?
00:37:01.430 - 00:37:38.842, Speaker C: Well, I mean, we have it on the video. It's all these new projects which are popping up and innovating. I mean, I think the flashlone, when Emilio and Andre first explained it, to know it made a tremendous amount of sense. And what's really great to see is how we keep seeing improvements to what already exists and we keep scaling. Right. And seeing the growth of defi, seeing how it's kind of popping up innovatively, but also by volume, that's super exciting for me. It's actually become a hobby of mine to read about DeFi at night and stuff, because the stuff you discover and the stuff you see that's completely new is quite impressive.
00:37:38.842 - 00:38:19.900, Speaker C: And, I mean, I think I was saying on the last chat that we keep being surprised by this state. Whenever you think it's going to go somewhere, it goes above, or, I mean, sometimes below, but currently I think it will go above. And I'm really looking forward to be surprised and pleasantly surprised that because I'm already so enthusiastic about Defi and everything that's popping. Yeah. It's hard to say into words exactly how we can expect these growth, but seeing innovatively and by liquidity wise, how it's been growing is really exciting for me.
00:38:20.590 - 00:38:28.880, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much, Ave team. Just to give you kind of a last chance to sort of answer that, what kind of excites you about the defi space as a builder right now?
00:38:32.470 - 00:39:58.086, Speaker A: I don't know. Honestly, I'm particularly fascinated by the possibility of creating synthetic SAS. I'm really fascinated by the Yuma protocol, for example, which allows you to create synthetic sasset out of everything that you can think about. But in general, I'm really fascinated by the idea of the possibility of bringing everything on Ethereum without actually bringing, like, for example, what the synthetics platform is doing, where you can actually mint whatever derivative token you think about that can be like, I don't know, synthetic bitcoin, synthetic litecoin, synthetic house, synthetic oil, synthetic gold, whatever, without actually bringing the oil or the gold or bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. It's just that it allows you to get exposure to that particular asset. And I'm really fascinated by this idea. And I think there will be a lot of growth in this next year and in the future on this specific field, it's really hard to predict.
00:39:58.086 - 00:40:23.300, Speaker A: The DeFi space is so evolving so quickly and in so different many directions that it's almost impossible to keep track of everything new that is being built every day. So let's say that the whole DeFi space is fascinating, actually. It's not one specific idea or one specific protocol or one specific, but the whole space is completely interesting.
00:40:23.670 - 00:40:23.986, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:24.008 - 00:40:38.120, Speaker D: And also very cool how it starts going to our life as well. Like monorith, the product where you can issue the card and pay with this card, it's becoming more and more made, and it's going to be widely used. I really like it.
00:40:39.930 - 00:41:06.734, Speaker B: All right, cool. Well, thank you very much, gentlemen. That kind of wraps up our q a today. I want to give a special thank you, obviously, to the Ave team who's here with us today, Johann, who participated as well, and also Issa from Ave, who helped me kind of organize everything and put everything together. We're looking to do more of these in the future, so by all means, please subscribe. I'll have this video kind of edited and up for everybody here in just a little while as well. Or you can simply view the full live stream right now if you want to.
00:41:06.734 - 00:41:20.966, Speaker B: So thank you again for joining us. And I'll put all the necessary links in the description so that if you want to learn more about what Ave is doing, Chainlink's doing, or any of this stuff that's happening right now, you have the opportunity to do so. So thank you once again, gentlemen, and have a fantastic day.
00:41:21.148 - 00:41:21.746, Speaker A: Bye bye.
00:41:21.778 - 00:41:22.626, Speaker C: Thank you, guys. Bye bye.
00:41:22.658 - 00:41:26.610, Speaker B: Bye bye. Thank you. Bye.
