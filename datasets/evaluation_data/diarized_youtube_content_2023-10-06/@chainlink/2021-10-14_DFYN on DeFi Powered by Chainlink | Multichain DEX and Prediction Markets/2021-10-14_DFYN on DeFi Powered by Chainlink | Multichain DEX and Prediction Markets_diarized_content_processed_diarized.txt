00:00:00.810 - 00:00:02.350, Speaker A: Great. How are you andy?
00:00:02.770 - 00:00:27.414, Speaker B: I'm really well. Love talking to people from around the world. I appreciate you guys staying up late. I know we got some time zone differences here, but coming to talk to our audience on YouTube. Hey everybody, how you doing on those youtubes? Nice to see you all here as well. If you have questions for the Defi team or for me, drop them in the chat. We can see those and we can talk to those to you guys throughout the session if you like.
00:00:27.414 - 00:00:40.570, Speaker B: But we're going to talk about DFI and learn a little bit about prediction markets and DFI and how those two things blend together. Romani, priesu, what are you guys seeing in the space these days? Like what's some interesting stuff that you've seen in the news the last couple of weeks in DFI?
00:00:42.110 - 00:00:46.970, Speaker A: So much happening I think. Where do we start? Where do we start?
00:00:47.120 - 00:00:51.274, Speaker B: Have you guys seen anything about DFI 2.0? What's DFI 2.0?
00:00:51.472 - 00:01:02.830, Speaker C: Yes, we have been following DFI 2.0 and a lot of new products are building. I think Olympus Dow is one unique product which is standing out and which is leading the herd.
00:01:04.690 - 00:01:06.480, Speaker B: Yeah, Romani, how about you?
00:01:07.170 - 00:01:29.734, Speaker A: Yeah, I think honestly I'm so heads down trying to just build the two, three products that we have. I think Priya Shu is probably the better person to get you a sense of where things because he does a lot of the research. There's Olympus Dow, there's one more project, I forget the name but yeah, sorry, Tokmac.
00:01:29.862 - 00:01:57.634, Speaker B: Yeah, there's some really interesting ones out there that are doing stuff building on top of kind of that first layer of defi, the ave's and curves and swaps, amms, things like that. So cool to see that. I like having builders on and asking them what they've seen in the space and I have no idea man, I'm in my know, no pressure there. It's chill but it's awesome to have you guys on. All right, let's see who we got. We got some comments here as well. I got mark in the chat as well.
00:01:57.634 - 00:02:06.166, Speaker B: Good to see you mark. Welcome community. Welcome mark. Good to see you budy. Let's get started. We're going to learn about Defi. Let's just do my little opener right here.
00:02:06.166 - 00:02:24.060, Speaker B: Welcome to Chainlink Live. We're back on Chainlink Live. We're going to learn a little bit about Defi today in define. Why don't you guys start us off, give us an introduction. What is define what are you all about and kind of what makes it special?
00:02:24.830 - 00:02:58.090, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I think define is basically amm. The first version is a unisoft book, literally. And we first started define in Polygon, given the advantages that Polygon had over Ethereum in terms of transaction speed and scalability and costs and some of those reasons. And now we are expanding to multiple other chains. We are going live in Phantom. We already have a small presence in orbitroom.
00:02:58.090 - 00:03:46.158, Speaker A: The idea is to sort of expand across all data chains, both EVM and non EVM, and give users the ability to have the same experience that users love and know on the Polygon chain. And that's not all. I think we're also innovating from a perspective of any AMm can take two parts. One is the Uniswap route, which is, let's look at concentrated market making, capital efficiency, and let's go after what you would call the institutional market. Although in crypto, it's sort of a continuous spectrum between retail and institutional. It's not like a very clear division like you have in traditional equity markets. So most amms, you have two paths.
00:03:46.158 - 00:04:18.480, Speaker A: You can go down the Unisop path, that is innovating on the AMM model, capital efficiency. Or you could go the sushi path, do a little bit of what Unisop does, which is what tried and et cetera are for sushi. But sushi is fundamentally so the retail customer. So you have a presence on all chains. You have the whole onsen and the whole sushi menu there. Not sushi, miso and a bunch of other stuff. We are sort of mixing and matching a little bit of both.
00:04:18.480 - 00:04:50.200, Speaker A: Obviously, we want to be on multiple chains, all the EVM chains. And there's reason to that that we'll come to, but we're also innovating on the core am as well. So we are figuring out how to improve the AMm model. What can we learn? Some of the new projects out there that are part of D five two point to what can we learn from them and try and launch an experience that is better suited to the institutional customer as well. So that's where we are in terms of where we are thinking.
00:04:51.310 - 00:05:30.390, Speaker B: How do you guys position your identity in the space when you come out and you talk to somebody who wants to do trades? You said you're somewhere in between a uni and a sushi. Sushi. What they did really well over the past year is established themselves on a bunch of different chains and established really well. Like, okay, there's going to be a liquidity pool. So that a project, when they launch, they're going to want to be on sushi to provide that farming and to do something with their treasury. Whereas the uni route really focused in deep in ethereum and optimism and things like that, but really innovated on the Amm spectrum. What's sort of your angle there? Your identity?
00:05:30.730 - 00:06:00.906, Speaker A: Right. I think alluded to that a little bit in the first question. I think when we first launched, we were actually the first gasless amm in the world. So literally you could come and swap and trade for free or most parts of the overall AMM experience was completely gasless. And this we achieved by integrating with metatransactions provider. In our case, it was biconomy. And I think that's going to be our core user.
00:06:00.906 - 00:06:48.570, Speaker A: Whichever chain we go to, especially in the l two side, we're going to make sure that it's going to be a gasless, seamless experience for the user. And then what really makes us stand apart is this thing that we're building called router. Router protocol is an allied project that we're building out. It's a cross chain messaging or communication mechanism. What that allows you to do is what that allows users to do is seamlessly communicate across blockchains. And it's a very generic problem, once solved, that lends itself to a lot of cross chain use cases, cross chain swapping, cross chain lending and borrowing. So imagine one inch across blockchains, ave across blockchains, compound across blockchains.
00:06:48.570 - 00:07:21.642, Speaker A: A lot of use cases then sort of follow naturally as a logical extension of that problem being solved. So that's what sort of differentiates defined from a lot of the other amms. They're probably the only amm that has a full fledged cross chain messaging layer that is optimized for defined, which is one of the reasons why we want to sort of go across many, many chains, as many chains as possible, and also have router also plugged into these chains and have defined nodes communicating with each other.
00:07:21.776 - 00:07:38.318, Speaker B: One of the big challenges with amms in crosschain is liquidity pools. Where is your liquidity pool? So to be able to have some access to liquidity pool on polygon and on phantom, and they can talk as well. Is that something we're talking about? Is that what you're aiming for?
00:07:38.484 - 00:08:18.854, Speaker C: Yes. One analysis we can give is that think of router as a superhighway connecting different communities, and the liquidity pools are the communities here. So define can be on polygon and define can be on phantom, and then the router can go and plug into both of these liquidity pools natively because we have built both of them. And then what happens is that we are able to solve the liquidity fragmentation problem as one of the key challenges bridges are facing is that they don't have sufficient liquidity. But if you already have a solid liquidity infrastructure in place, then that becomes a much easier problem to solve.
00:08:18.982 - 00:08:28.554, Speaker B: And not just bridges, but like across chain. You've got sushion avalanche, you've got sushi on ethereum. The liquidity pools don't talk to each other. They're separate pools.
00:08:28.682 - 00:08:42.850, Speaker C: One more thing we are trying to do, and in fact we are doing, is that the router will not only plug to define. I mean, define will be a priority exchange, but it can also plug into other exchanges when there is not sufficient liquidity on define.
00:08:43.590 - 00:08:46.920, Speaker B: Cool. Are you guys prediction markets as well?
00:08:47.450 - 00:09:12.346, Speaker C: Yes, we have prediction markets. Currently, prediction markets are live for matic prices. And we have five minute, 15 minutes and 30 minutes candle. What you can do is you can come on the prediction markets and you can use your technical analysis or just your hunch to say whether the price will go up or down in the next x minutes. And if it goes down, then you win. If it goes up, then you lose.
00:09:12.458 - 00:09:19.242, Speaker B: Those are yes, no markets, as we like to call them. Go ahead, Romani.
00:09:19.306 - 00:09:54.694, Speaker A: Sorry. On the prediction markets front, I'll add one thing, though. I mean, the current version that you see is very much an alpha. And I think it got a lot of traction. And then there's some problem with the graph interface, the graph infrastructure that was supporting it. So we've not really put in a lot of muscles there, but there's still some organic volume that comes in, and it's very much, we're sort of learning use of behavior, but there is actually a team that sort of partnered with us, and they're building out prediction markets for a few different. I think they're launching it for cricket.
00:09:54.694 - 00:10:12.670, Speaker A: There's a cricket World cup happening very soon, so I think the team will have some announcements to make. This particular team is called Yoda, as in the Yoda from. So I think that's the other prediction market piece worth mentioning.
00:10:15.670 - 00:10:20.610, Speaker B: So you guys aren't here. There's a chainlink integration announcement. How are you guys using Chainlink and defined?
00:10:21.990 - 00:10:46.890, Speaker C: So currently, Chainlink is providing us data feed for, I mean, our current model in launching the prediction market is that whichever chain we go to, we launch a prediction market there. So since now we are going soon to Phantom, so we are going to launch prediction markets for prices there as well. And there we are going to use chain link Oracle again for Phantom and the same strategy will keep on applying like a loop.
00:10:47.790 - 00:11:11.826, Speaker B: Awesome. You talk about cricket markets. Chainlink sports data is available as well. I hope we're having conversations with you about that. And if we're not, then start that conversation because that is certainly a component of that. Awesome to hear that you guys are using Chainlink feeds for those prediction markets to settle those on polygon especially. There's some native speed things there that are benefit to a lot of people who use those.
00:11:12.008 - 00:11:12.740, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:14.230 - 00:11:54.466, Speaker B: So I want to get back to this Amm question and this idea about cross chain amm because this is like one of these DFI 1.0 ideas is that we've got liquidity pools, we've got amms. Now we're talking DFI 2.0. I'm hammering on this term because I actually like it in this context and I haven't talked to that many people about what DFI 2.0 is. Is that like multichain? Is it this blend of using algorithms and amms type stuff as capital, efficiency and speed? How do you guys see solving this problem going forward as an industry? Because it seems like it's not just one approach, right? There's these multiple different approaches. Different teams are kind of taking this.
00:11:54.466 - 00:11:56.210, Speaker B: Where do you see the industry headed?
00:11:57.190 - 00:12:28.570, Speaker C: I think that the industry is headed towards efficiency. I mean, if you try to transfer assets from one chain to another, it's still a huge problem if you try to find better rates on market. So there are chains sometimes where you can find a better price for ethereum, but going in and out from that chain is a huge pain. So I think, I mean, just think of how the traditional industries work. Think of booking a flight. So it's mostly abstracted from users. They don't see much.
00:12:28.570 - 00:12:52.786, Speaker C: They are able to go on a neat and clean interface. They're just able to put in their requirements and they are able to get the best prices. And a lot of infra is behind those scenes. It's not just the OTA. It's also a lot of different providers who are providing this flight information, different flight companies. And then there are different aggregators. There's a whole chain behind that.
00:12:52.786 - 00:13:12.460, Speaker C: But all of that is abstracted from the users. So I think with DeFi 2.0 and maybe in future DeFi 3.0, in the end we lead to a road where the markets are very efficient and you are able to get the same rates on assets across all chains. And it's very easy and very cheap to move between different chains. That is the end game.
00:13:13.550 - 00:13:29.630, Speaker B: The no gas trading, like no gas Dexes is a really interesting user experience layer that kind of contributes to that. It's not just efficiency in terms of my capital, but also efficiency in my experience as well. Kind of that layering.
00:13:30.610 - 00:14:04.940, Speaker C: Right now, one problem people usually have is if you transfer assets to, say, a new chain, like, say, ok, exchange, then you don't have native tokens to pay for the gas fee. And let's say you transferred USDT there. But still, I mean, to convert that USDT to the native token in the amm, you still need the gas token of that native chain, and then that becomes a problem. And people usually leave at this step. So a gasless exchange is able to mitigate this problem. They're able to swap without any gas, and they are able to start using the amm without having these issues.
00:14:06.590 - 00:14:14.222, Speaker B: Go ahead, Romani. We do have some cool audience questions as so I want to get your thoughts and then we're going to turn and answer some of these as well. But go ahead.
00:14:14.276 - 00:15:17.486, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I sort of chiming, adding on to what Priyashu mentioned, right. I think when we are building way back in 2018, we are building a stablecoin dex on zero weeks. And one of the problems we're grappling with is how do you bootstrap liquidity, right? And how do you convince folks to come in and lend us some money with which we can create a liquidity pool and then likes of compound and Uniswap, et cetera? They came up very elegant solutions to that. And then right now, the two, three big problems are how do you solve for impermanent loss? How do you make liquidity more efficient, and how do you make cross chain governance more efficient? Those are some of the big problems with D five 1.0. And I think you seem the beginnings of a solution to a lot of these approaches with D five 2.0. And you have obviously exceptionally smart teams, exceptionally well funded, Unisoft sushisoft, obviously there. But as always, there's going to be some outlier, some small team out of nowhere that's going to come and blow us all away with a completely different approach.
00:15:17.486 - 00:15:54.686, Speaker A: And I think eventually we're going to get to a space where in the Mid ninety s or even 15 years ago, if you were working on a document on Microsoft Word, it is such a pain for you to get it across from Windows to Apple to some of the word processor. But now it's all seamless it's a screen and the underlying technology is sort of opaque to you. You don't see what's going on underneath. The same way I think the eventual goal is to have a seamless experience. So you don't really care what blockchain is underneath or how your order is getting fulfilled. You just get the best execution. Going back to the flight analogy, I.
00:15:54.708 - 00:16:06.994, Speaker B: Make my kids their computers on Linux. I make them deal with Linux so that they have to deal with installing packages and updating. I still see some of that. But that's intentional, right?
00:16:07.032 - 00:16:07.934, Speaker A: That's intentional.
00:16:08.062 - 00:16:26.390, Speaker B: Give an intentional experience. But now the operating system metaphor, I think is actually really tight and nice. Most Linux packages I got pop OS, it's still pretty solid. But there's some stuff like that. Got some good. Got to put your kids through the ringer. Got a couple of good questions first, Jose.
00:16:26.390 - 00:16:37.420, Speaker B: No, Michael Schumacher is my clone. They took a clone of me. Dude, I love that guy. He looks just like me. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, absolutely.
00:16:37.790 - 00:16:38.746, Speaker C: I know.
00:16:38.928 - 00:17:07.560, Speaker B: And I'm slow though, that's the thing. But Jose has another really good question. Is it possible to bring multi chain dexes without the use of first, you know, for the audience, how would you define a bridge? I think of it as like locking liquidity somewhere to mint it elsewhere. And then that kind of creates this bridge. Are there other models for that, for liquidity? And then does that apply for dexes and multi chain? Any thoughts around that?
00:17:09.930 - 00:17:11.000, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:17:11.690 - 00:17:56.782, Speaker C: Yes. So this is a very interesting question, I would say, and it is actually possible, but that would require like a completely new radical approach. For example, when you are using different one model of bridge, we all know that is locking liquidity on chain a, releasing it on chain b, and similarly doing from b to a. This is the traditional bridge. But now we are also seeing some new use cases come up in which the wallet, MPC wallet is being used to lock up assets of different chains. For example, bitcoin and ethereum. Both can be locked in a same wallet with a seed phrase.
00:17:56.782 - 00:18:45.998, Speaker C: I mean, they will belong to the same chain. Sorry. I mean they will belong to the different chains where they belong, but the ownership of that asset will be maintained by a MPC blockchain. Now the ownership right of that MPC blockchain can be transferred between two different parties. For example, Alice wants to sell Ethereum to bob for bitcoin. Now the MPC blockchain is just going to update the registry of the ownership and the swap will happen and both of them will be able to withdraw their native assets. So this mean a bridge won't be technically used for the whole process and still a Dex kind of swap experience will happen without actually using a bridge.
00:18:46.174 - 00:19:11.486, Speaker B: Like the blockchain is the bridge not like a single set of smart contracts which we think of as a bridge, but an entire validator will become a. I think, you know, the Cosmos IBC model is like that. Interchange communication as opposed to smart contracts holding it in a bridge. I'm not sure what Polkadot has. I think it's similar. Avalanche subnets may have that as well. So I think we are starting to see that technology.
00:19:11.486 - 00:19:21.520, Speaker B: It's not super widely adopted yet, but absolutely has implications for all this. But those are not necessarily EVM chains, right? So that changes it as well.
00:19:22.370 - 00:19:46.146, Speaker C: What happens if you build this technology around a wallet? What happens is that if there is one thing common between all of the blockchains, it's not that they are EVM or they are not EVM, it is that all of them have a seed phrase. And then if you build a security layer and the blockchain around those wallet, then you are able to practically integrate into all different ecosystems.
00:19:46.338 - 00:20:03.600, Speaker B: Interesting. Got another question here from J 20. Can you go over some use cases for router? On define other than trading, will we see other functionality that takes advantage of Cross chain capabilities? I like this question a lot.
00:20:04.450 - 00:20:09.946, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think mosquitoes. Something really bothering.
00:20:10.058 - 00:20:13.106, Speaker B: I've got a hair that's like floating around. So I apologize as well.
00:20:13.128 - 00:20:55.802, Speaker A: We're all dealing with. Yeah, I think, as I said, I think router is designed primarily as a broad cross chain communication mechanism. So the whole trading, cross chain trading use case is a very specific use case of the whole crosschain problem. One could conceivably look at crosschain lending and borrowing. Obviously the crosschain shop case is very powerful. You want to get assets across from Ethereum to polygon to BSE and all those other chains that are coming up and make sure your farming happens. But then you could look at lending and borrowing.
00:20:55.802 - 00:21:42.174, Speaker A: Let's say you have USDT available at 5% to borrow on chain one, but you're getting 10% to lend it out on chain two, right? Boom. So you have an automatic arbitrage there that you can. So somebody could conceivably build a lending and borrowing platform that primarily takes advantage of these different interest rates on various lending platforms and various chains. Or you could have a yield aggregator that pretty much is the same thing. So you are farming on multiple chains and you have the highest yields on a specific chain. So immediately you unwind your farm on one chain one, take it to chain two, or even reconstitute it on the fly. So once you have the messaging piece, you could do swapping trading, you could do a tornado cash across chains if you want to.
00:21:42.174 - 00:21:44.206, Speaker A: Whatever you fancy is possible.
00:21:44.388 - 00:22:20.246, Speaker B: Yield aggregation is a really compelling use case to me in that as a user, I don't need to care about whether it's multi chain. All I need to do is deposit, maintain my seed phrase and collect yield. Right? That's it. The developers and the strategists who are doing that, they can then select where is the best liquidity and however they want to model that, whether that's incentivized or whatever it is. That's a model of product development that makes a lot of sense. It's comparable to the financial world as well. Like, oh, I need to make an integration with this bank or this fund or with this whatever it is around the world.
00:22:20.246 - 00:22:24.298, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense for people who are coming into the space as well.
00:22:24.384 - 00:22:37.262, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you just have a 401K account that's linked to your provider and boom, you just reallocate every year, once a year. You don't care about whether he puts it to the fidelity fund or the Magdalene fund. That's not your problem, that's their problem.
00:22:37.396 - 00:23:03.240, Speaker B: But if you do care about that, then you can go do that too. You have that? Yeah, you can do access as well. That's really interesting. J 20 has another really great one. But before you get there, what about cross chain and nfts? And this is not necessarily a technical, let's imagine that's possible. We can verify that an NFT is legitimately a crypto punk from Ethereum. Have you guys had thoughts or interest around the utility of that? Would that be a driver for use?
00:23:03.770 - 00:23:54.386, Speaker C: Yes, actually I was thinking about this few days ago and one problem I see is that a lot of nfts on Opensea, I mean, it's quite difficult to trade them because they are too expensive. I'm sorry, the ethereum gas fees is expensive. So if there was a way that if you could lock those nfts on, say, ethereum just once, and then we could mint a NFT certificate on say, polygon and then a whole market could split, I mean, could come up on polygon or a different chain where trading would happen in a much faster way than Ethereum. Because on Ethereum the trading fees would be like 100 or $200 for buying and selling NFT. And this price will go to maybe one cent on polygon. So the trading velocity of nfts will increase.
00:23:54.418 - 00:24:22.986, Speaker B: If this happens on openC, it's just an example of a platform. If you want to sell an NFT, you set a price. When you set that price, it costs gas to set that price. When you want to change that price, it costs gas to change that price, which it makes sense. It's on chain, right? But it's kind of prohibitive. If I put something up there, I don't want to be changing the price and putting the market, like, every day, I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars potentially to do that. So that's a really interesting use case for crosschain.
00:24:22.986 - 00:24:32.786, Speaker B: NFTs is not necessarily that I want to display mine or move it around on polygon, but maybe I want to do some transaction elements on there on a layer two or on polygon or wherever it happens to be, wherever liquidity is.
00:24:32.808 - 00:24:32.946, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:32.968 - 00:25:01.978, Speaker B: It's the same question. Okay, J 20 has got another really interesting question that I want to get your guys opinion on. Clearly been in the space for a number of years, been building on layer twos and dexes and things like that, even though we're a little overtime, if you guys got to go, I know it's late for you, but I appreciate it. But let's talk just for a few minutes about this, and then we'll talk about your roadmap. Do you think other chains will still be relevant once the ETH 2.0 merge happens? Or. Let's just talk about the consequences of ETH 2.0
00:25:01.978 - 00:25:20.260, Speaker B: and multichain and what that is, because right now, layer two is we've got arbitram, we've got optimism, we've got Polygon, we've got all these different sorts of side chains and other solutions, tons of bridges. What do you think the relationship of E 2.0 may be in the coming years, months, whenever that happens to be?
00:25:23.190 - 00:25:33.298, Speaker A: I'll go for. I think Praeshu has something to add here. Sorry. Go first? Yeah, you want to go first? Patio?
00:25:33.394 - 00:25:57.102, Speaker C: Yeah, I can go first. I have this one point to add E 2.0, even if it is very good and if it is very cheap. First of all, it won't be very cheap. It's going to reduce the gas transactions, but it won't make it to zero. I mean, if it does that, then miners will run away and the network will not become secure. So even with all the optimization, one thing to note is that ETH 2.0
00:25:57.102 - 00:26:47.360, Speaker C: will for sure optimize it and make it better. A lot of weak chains will die. But one thing is that chains which end up building a very strong community, they will still flourish because they'll have a whole ecosystem around that and a lot of products and lot of users. So once people get used to using those products and services, they don't easily migrate. And then the second thing is that there are different chains like Cosmos and Solana, which are non EVM compatible, and they are doing different things, and they are opening some new design paradigms which are not available on Ethereum. So even those chains will continue to flourish. The only threat I see is to the EVM chains, which are not really building a huge community.
00:26:47.360 - 00:26:48.960, Speaker C: That is my.
00:26:51.570 - 00:27:23.274, Speaker A: Sorry, I think I completely agree with the way blockchains are developing. They're a bit like how cities develop, right? You have New York City, it has charms, it's got Brooklyn, it's got all those cool bars and venues. And then you have San Francisco, and then you have Singapore, and then you have Berlin. And then mean, is everybody going to go to flock to New York City or San Francisco? Or. I mean, I think Yoki Bira said it once, right? Nobody goes there anymore. It's too. Or everybody's there.
00:27:23.274 - 00:28:05.830, Speaker A: Nobody goes there anymore. Something like that. He said something sort of very funny. That sort of is where ethereum is, right? It's so popular, any new capacity and new bandwidth is going to be lapped up super quickly and it's pretty much going to be as bad as it was when it started. So it's going to be needing to innovate at a very rapid pace just to sort of preserve the current user experience. So therefore there's going to be space for all the other chains that are also doing some interesting things. You know what the winners are? An except for binance smart chain, most of the exchange chains will die a natural death.
00:28:05.830 - 00:28:36.050, Speaker A: But I think a lot of the other chains are very solana, for instance, is optimized for speed of transactions. And terra is doing some interesting things, and the whole cosmos ecosystem again. And Polkadot is doing some very interesting things. So you'll have a few EVM chains, and there are a bunch of other paradigms as well. And the future, even things like Hedera Hashcraft, which technically is far more superior at some level to the traditional Blockchain methodology, right? Even they might find adoption.
00:28:37.590 - 00:29:10.870, Speaker B: The scale of potential adoption is a lot larger than most individuals can comprehend. When you're talking about 7 billion people on earth and how they might use technology or more people than that in the coming 1050 years. There's room for technology in my opinion. I love the city's metaphor. I've not actually heard that, but I don't live in New York City. I love New York City, but I don't want to live there. And there's plenty of other places to live and there's good reasons to live in other places.
00:29:10.870 - 00:29:28.286, Speaker B: That doesn't mean that New York is a bad place. It means it has these pros and cons and things like that. Thank you for that. That was really insightful. J 20. Thank you so much for the questions, guys. Tell us where is Dfine headed? We're a little overtime, but that's okay.
00:29:28.286 - 00:29:35.794, Speaker B: It's been a great conversation. Get to know you. Where's Defi headed? What can we look to see in the next couple of weeks and the next couple of months going forward?
00:29:35.992 - 00:30:20.062, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think we define this as a project is very young, right? I mean, we launched a year ago with the first decks in Quickspa, but we really sort of kicked it up a notch when we did the polka starter. Ido May 10, May 11. So it's maybe four or five months old. And part of the thing that we're learning as an organization is to sort of imagine a bunch of 15 young developers sort of living literally on the screen and living in a hacker house in a few cities. And there's so many ideas right now, at least till a couple of months ago, we're chasing down every single idea, trying to execute on it. But now we're sort of maturing as a company, trying to figure out what to prioritize, what not to prioritize, what's the strategic goal.
00:30:20.062 - 00:30:46.566, Speaker A: So with that in mind, I think over the next few months you're going to see a few things. One is you're going to see integration with router, the router maintenance around the corner. So you're going to have defined node on the defined node and polygon acting as the router terminating endpoint on polygon. Right. And you're going to have a lot of those cross chain use cases coming through. Define. We're going to launch v two on define.
00:30:46.566 - 00:31:14.018, Speaker A: Very much like the unisoft functionality, but even better with limit orders, et cetera, that I would say is a Q four target. Then we're working on an idea that's going to completely change the way amms function. That's still early drawing board, I think. I'm sure there's ten other guys thinking of the same idea. We are hoping to sort of do some things there. So a lot of interesting core ideas. And then obviously you have spin off ideas like prediction markets like stablecoins that sort of affiliated teams are working with our support.
00:31:14.018 - 00:31:16.420, Speaker A: So a lot of interesting things happening.
00:31:16.870 - 00:31:31.690, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, hopefully chainlink remains a part of those conversations. I know you guys will stay in touch with us. This has been awesome to get to know you guys. Audience, thank you so much for your questions. Are you guys primarily a discord crew or a telegram crew or both equally?
00:31:32.430 - 00:31:37.418, Speaker A: We're primarily a telegram crew trying to be a discord crew just because it's more structured. But yeah.
00:31:37.584 - 00:31:56.670, Speaker B: Okay. So we'll drive people here, go to the discord, help them out as they try. But a lot of the conversation there on telegram as well and follow define on twitter. All the links to that stuff is down in the description below. So you guys can go and follow up if you had more questions or come across people you want to be like, hey, man, I heard about this really cool project. Go check them out. Plenty of places to share there.
00:31:56.670 - 00:32:02.260, Speaker B: Romani, prieshoot, thank you so much for coming on. It's been nice getting to know you. See you guys later.
00:32:02.630 - 00:32:05.780, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Andy, pleasure. Thank you for having us.
00:32:06.550 - 00:32:20.342, Speaker B: That was cool. A couple of cool guys got to know this project, everybody. Thank you for coming on. What some killer questions, man. I love this crew who comes and watches and hangs out with me. Mark, Kevin, I see you both in there hanging out as well. I appreciate that.
00:32:20.342 - 00:32:36.046, Speaker B: Do me a favor, like and subscribe. Subscribe to this. We do these amas a couple every week. We're not tomorrow, but hold on, let me see what we got next week coming up. Oh, man. We got future swap coming up next week. That's a big one.
00:32:36.046 - 00:32:53.054, Speaker B: That announcement just came out yesterday for chainlink integration. And then the following week we got a bunch of other stuff as well. So like and subscribe, follow chainlink on Twitter at chainlink and at smart. Underscore contract as well to get updates on when these go live.
00:32:53.092 - 00:32:54.046, Speaker A: You can follow me too if you want.
00:32:54.068 - 00:33:05.010, Speaker B: I'm at Andy Boyan if you want to give me a petty like on some of this stuff that I do. Anyways, awesome questions. Thank you so much. We'll talk to you guys next time. Next week on chainlink live. Peace.
