00:00:06.810 - 00:00:36.680, Speaker A: Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. I'm here with Gareth Bowles from Perry Finance, and we're going to be talking about Perry's synthetic products, about their plans for Defi on the Polkadot ecosystem, and of course, how they're using Chainlink. Gareth, welcome to the stream. Happy to have you here and chat with you a little bit on this fine morning and your afternoon. Let's get into it. What is Perry, what are your product offerings and kind of what differentiates Peri finance? Sure.
00:00:37.390 - 00:01:34.860, Speaker B: Thank you, Andy. So, Perry is a cross chain synthetic asset. Issuance and derivatives, decentralized exchange. Cross chain basically means the DaP will run on multi chain networks such as Ethereum and Polkadot. And to break that down, synthetic asset, what does that actually mean? It's a tokenized asset that has the same value as the original asset. So, for example, if you want to, as an investor, as an individual, want to get access to gold as an asset class, you want to buy Tesla shares or apple, or trade the german Dax, you can do that through a synthetic asset that we will be able to provide to people. And that's essentially the nuts and bolts of it.
00:01:35.870 - 00:01:44.670, Speaker A: So, just as a quick clarification, is USDT a synthetic? Is tether a synthetic? Would you classify it as such?
00:01:44.820 - 00:01:45.998, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah.
00:01:46.084 - 00:01:50.446, Speaker A: It's a version. Right. It's pegged. So stablecoins are essentially synthetics in their own way.
00:01:50.548 - 00:02:19.686, Speaker B: Yeah. When you buy USDT, you don't own the underlying dollar. You own a contract that says somewhere there's a dollar that sits in a bank account that's tied to this contract. But, I mean, that's been a bone of contention. Is that actually the case? But, yeah, that's essentially what it is. It's a synthetic product which mimics the exact price of the underlying asset. And that's what we're talking about here.
00:02:19.868 - 00:02:43.390, Speaker A: I think usually we talk about gold, like the price of gold, because you can't actually trade physical gold on a blockchain. You can go to a vendor and buy actual gold and trade that and do that swap somewhere in your town on the blockchain. You've got to have it synthetic. And so it just kind of makes sense narratively in your head. But really, stablecoins are synthetics, wrapped versions of coins. Right. If you are on Polygon, you've got wrapped eth.
00:02:43.390 - 00:02:45.474, Speaker A: That's essentially synthetic, too, right?
00:02:45.592 - 00:02:47.186, Speaker B: Yes, that's right.
00:02:47.288 - 00:02:57.380, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So that's their synthetics. And Perry is a synthetics platform, and you're on Ethereum, you're on Polkadot. What's the story, where's Perry at and what's happening there?
00:02:57.910 - 00:03:33.970, Speaker B: So we're on Ethereum at the moment. So it's built on Ethereum, but we plan to move to Polkadot, possibly not exclusively, but for the potential benefits that might give us, such as speed, number of transactions that can be simultaneously processed, avoiding things like high gas fees. So there's a number of potential benefits to using that polka dot network, which we're more than exploring. We're planning to launch there q four this year.
00:03:34.120 - 00:03:36.366, Speaker A: Are you doing other L2s in the meantime?
00:03:36.558 - 00:03:47.778, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. So we're looking at L2 as a solution to some of those issues on Ethereum, and that's something that we'll work on concurrently.
00:03:47.954 - 00:03:56.280, Speaker A: Awesome. So can you tell me a little bit about how the perisynths, those pinths we talked about, how do those work?
00:03:56.730 - 00:04:55.260, Speaker B: Sure. A lot of this really did take me some time to get my head around because having come from the financial services background, you're quite familiar with sort of abstract terminology and trying to understand how financial products are constructed. So this is kind of the same, but obviously in this defi market, which is exploding, it's kind of opened it up to a whole new user base. So the difficulty we have is in articulating exactly your question. How does it work? Can you explain the mechanics behind it? And I'll try and do so as simply as possible. So if you want to participate in the community, you buy Perry token. You take your Perry token, which is like the gatekeeper into the ecosystem, you stake it.
00:04:55.260 - 00:05:33.430, Speaker B: You can then mint pints, for example, PusD, which is the synthetic US dollar. And then you basically take your pint, your pUSd, and you can trade it against gold, you can trade it against bitcoin, you can trade it against whatever you want to trade, whatever. As an individual, you would like to have exposure to both long or short. So if you think the market is going up or down, you'll be able to trade that pin with leverage if you want it through the ecosystem.
00:05:36.650 - 00:05:45.370, Speaker A: So I get the Perry token and I stake it. Does the Perry token have a stable value or is that market fluctuations?
00:05:46.750 - 00:06:04.720, Speaker B: It's quoted currently on a couple of centralized exchanges. So that has a fluctuating market value. There's a limited number of tokens that will be available. So we fully expect that to appreciate modestly over time.
00:06:06.370 - 00:06:19.400, Speaker A: So I get $100 worth of tokens, let's just say, and I stake them in the protocol. Can I pull out, or can I mint $100 worth of synthetics? Or is there a collateralization ratio that I need to.
00:06:20.090 - 00:07:01.330, Speaker B: There is a collateralization ratio that you'll need to maintain. So it's not one for one. I think it's eight to one against. So therefore, you've always got the liquidity available in the debt pool. And then, depending on the value of Perry as it rises and falls, you'll be able to mint more pints, and you'll want to burn pints as the value of Perry decreases so that you can maintain that collateralization ratio. And then there's rewards given to you as a staker for maintaining the optimum c ratio.
00:07:04.390 - 00:07:21.930, Speaker A: They're like lending pools, almost, right. Decentralized lending pools. They're pretty similar in construction, wherein there's depositors who provide liquidity. That liquidity can act as collateral so that they can withdraw, but they have to maintain a ratio otherwise. Are there liquidations?
00:07:22.750 - 00:08:07.814, Speaker B: Yeah, it acts in almost a similar way to if you trade with a dedicated market maker. So if you have a huge Chicago based high frequency fund, who is the counterparty behind your trades? They'll be earning the fees, they'll be managing the risk, they'll be owners of that debt pool. Essentially, what we're doing is we're taking this away from centralized counterparties like that, and everyone that participates in the ecosystem is part of that pool, and they're also earning the rewards for being part of it as well. So you're democratizing the earnings rather than keeping it very concentrated at the top.
00:08:07.932 - 00:08:45.534, Speaker A: Well, this is the key value proposition of defi itself, is it democratizes who can be a market maker who deserves to be in those pools? Well, the current financial system, it just doesn't make sense to let everybody pitch in $10 or however much it is or be a part of that. But with smart contracts, we can do that. Right? It retains ownership. You have that sovereignty to do what you want with your funds, and so you can pull those funds together in a decentralized way, securely. So that's really cool. Good to kind of get our head around that. And, of course, more information if you want to get deep into the technicals in the Perry documentation.
00:08:45.534 - 00:09:11.082, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. I just want to give a shout out to the audience here watching. My name is Andy. We're on Chainlink Live, talking to Perry finances, Gareth Bowles. We've talked a little bit about what Perry does. How is it different between traditional finance and synthetics assets? What are some of the. Again, those differences between the ways that, hey, Paul, how you doing? I see your questions, too.
00:09:11.082 - 00:09:19.630, Speaker A: If you guys have questions, drop them in the chat. Sorry. Good. What are some of the differences between traditional finance synthetics and the way this works other than the liquidity poolers?
00:09:20.050 - 00:10:00.874, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of differences. Right. So it's important distinction to make is when you're buying or selling a synthetic product. So you're getting exposure to synthetic gold, you're not buying physical gold, or you're not buying the physical share, you're buying a smart contract which mimics that price. So that's an important distinction to make, because when you buy a physical share, you have to open a brokerage account, you have to send them some money. So that's another important distinction. You retain custody of your asset in your own wallet.
00:10:00.874 - 00:10:23.540, Speaker B: You're not having to send dollars or pounds to a third party from which they're going to take a healthy slice. There's going to be tax implications. It's all going to take a significant amount of time, more than it will be to mint a pint and buy the synthetic, as opposed to doing it the traditional way.
00:10:24.310 - 00:10:57.870, Speaker A: There's some really interesting speed implications for enterprises and institutions because it takes them a long time to move. But if you got a $10 billion fund and you allocate a small amount, right, $10 million to DFI, you could move real fast. You could move, like within minutes on some stuff that might take a lot longer just because of the ownership of those assets and everything. So there's some really interesting opportunities there in the future as well that I'm interested to see develop. How are you guys using Chainlink?
00:10:59.730 - 00:11:47.120, Speaker B: So we're going to use them for the price discovery. So real time pricing of the synthetic assets that will be available. The synthetic assets that will be available, by the way, will be in the most liquid markets, because how could you define a price for something that's totally illiquid and maybe comes out twice a year? So the focus will be on things like commodities and indices and foreign exchange, where it's easy to get a quick real time price that's accurate as well. It has to be accurate. Uptime has to be next to 100% or as close as possible. And that is something that Chainlink will give us.
00:11:48.130 - 00:12:17.906, Speaker A: Yeah, I just saw a tweet somewhere that Chainlink added another forex feed, so we're up to 20 something. I don't remember what it was, but I think we got a chilean peso or something. I can't remember what it was. So, Mark, maybe you remember if you saw that tweet. But there are a ton of those forex price feeds, and people choose chain link. Projects choose chain link because of that uptime reliability. I mean, Chainlink pulls price data from multiple exchanges, multiple data providers who are pulling it from hundreds of exchanges.
00:12:17.906 - 00:12:48.546, Speaker A: So it's like decentralized at all these levels because you can't have like a temporary price feed or something that just goes down as a synthetic asset. Right. You lose your peg and somebody trading all of a sudden loses their liquidity, and then they get liquidated. And that's a big problem. So that's interesting. I've seen a couple of other synthetic projects use the price feeds in those ways to make sure that those pegged assets, gold, for example, or commodities, those are starting to come out on Chainlink feeds, maintain their real world value.
00:12:48.728 - 00:13:06.310, Speaker B: Yeah, we looked at other Defi projects like Synthetix and Yuan Finance and Kyber, who are all using Chainlink, and that also gives us another level of confidence. But, yeah, from what we've seen, it is pretty bulletproof.
00:13:08.170 - 00:13:22.430, Speaker A: The protocol is good, man. I like it. I'm a fan, obviously. I hope. And as our people here. Hey, everybody, if you've got your questions for Gareth and Perry, go ahead and drop them in the chat. You can always also join their communities.
00:13:22.430 - 00:13:25.470, Speaker A: Are you guys more telegram or discord oriented?
00:13:26.770 - 00:13:33.280, Speaker B: Telegram. So I think you're going to put the link to the bottom. So, yeah, I always ask.
00:13:33.890 - 00:14:00.742, Speaker A: It's interesting to see where communities live. Some are just like live on Discord, some on telegram, and you never can tell. Okay, Mark found the tweet right here. I don't know if I can get to it just the way I have it. All right, how do I do this? I can't do it on mine. So, anyways, there's a link, if you want to go see it, about the forex things, just because of the set up I have, I can't click it. Talking about synthetics.
00:14:00.742 - 00:14:17.280, Speaker A: What is something about synthetics in crypto that people just. Is a misunderstanding. You come from some traditional finance into this world of tech people and degents who are just excited to get involved in Defi. What are some of those basic understandings, things that you wish people knew?
00:14:19.650 - 00:15:04.830, Speaker B: Yeah. As we've mentioned before, we are really kind of working on the cutting edge, the bleeding edge of this whole space. So it's a learning experience for everybody. And I'm sure that a lot of things that we conceive now will be completely different in six months time or a year's time. But, yeah, I think that important distinction is that you don't own the underlying asset that you're buying access to. And you obviously have the ability to use leverage as well, which is kind of a double edged sword. I've seen leverage be the undoing of many an investor, both private and institutional.
00:15:04.830 - 00:15:49.980, Speaker B: So we're offering, conservatively up to 20 times, but compared to other financial products available out there, that is pretty conservative, but more than enough, in my opinion. And for anyone sort of starting out in this space, the best place to start is by doing it, because we had this discussion earlier today. You can read white papers, you can look at process diagrams, but unless you actually engage in the community and get involved and just do it, then it becomes inculcated, then it starts to make a lot more sense, and then it just kind of clicks into place. A bit like driving a car.
00:15:50.930 - 00:16:20.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. It's a bummer because it's not easy to scale user adoption if every single person needs to just get in and have their handheld. But that's a really effective way to learn. So if you're in now, you can go to Perry and you can use the wallet and practice these things. And now there's documentation out there about how to connect those things. So doing some of that research yourself is a pretty important component of that. So please do that and get involved.
00:16:20.914 - 00:16:32.620, Speaker A: That's how I got started in this is like, I just got excited and was like all I. What's this uniswap thing? How does it work? Okay, what's metamask? How does it work? And I figured it out, and then the rest is history. Here I am.
00:16:34.110 - 00:16:59.566, Speaker B: I think in the early days of bitcoin, they paid people to learn how to mine, and that's how they got the engagement of that community. We're doing things like, if you buy Perry token, there's an inflation reward attached to it, so the early users will be really rewarded in terms of the fees generated that get paid back to the Perry holders.
00:16:59.758 - 00:17:24.234, Speaker A: Well, that's all of yield farming, right? If you stake, if you provide liquidity, you get incentives, and there's those models to help kickstart that flywheel. So. Absolutely agree. That's how to get started. There is risk, of course, involved, because you never know on what the value of a token is going to be and what the rate and APY is going to be, et cetera, et cetera. We do have a question. Here we go.
00:17:24.234 - 00:17:29.180, Speaker A: Curious about the name for Perry. Where does that come from? How did you choose that.
00:17:30.670 - 00:17:44.718, Speaker B: I'll be honest with you, I've got no idea. That was for you colleagues of mine that came up with it that I kind of said, yeah, okay. It doesn't mean anything bad in English, so we'll go with that.
00:17:44.804 - 00:17:53.762, Speaker A: All right. I like it. It's quirky. Well, go dig in. Now you've got, like, some trivia. Somebody's got a secret somewhere about where that comes from. Somebody's initials, maybe.
00:17:53.762 - 00:17:56.646, Speaker A: Who knows? On the blockchain firm, I think the.
00:17:56.668 - 00:18:20.686, Speaker B: Feeling was that pinth kind of rolled off the tongue in many different languages. So, yeah, you do often get the issue where words and phrases don't quite transmit into other languages as well. Whereas Pinth was felt that between asian languages and English and others, it kind of works reasonably well.
00:18:20.788 - 00:18:27.914, Speaker A: Nice. And Polkadot. Synthetic pinth. I like that. That works for branding. Polygon. Synthetic pinth.
00:18:27.914 - 00:18:38.580, Speaker A: Okay, I'm digging it now. I'm on. Gareth, it's been great getting to know you, getting to know the Perry protocol a little bit. What's on the roadmap for you guys? What's coming up in the next few months?
00:18:39.030 - 00:19:13.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you actually join us at a pretty interesting time, because literally today we've launched the Dapp, which is the ability to stake using metamask with your own wallet. And that's literally gone live today. So all the guys are really busy kind of helping the community understand that. Writing tutorials about how to do it. There's a web page up now which will explain this as well. So that was a big piece of the roadmap that we had over the next month, and that's gone live today.
00:19:14.020 - 00:19:45.094, Speaker A: Awesome. We'll make sure I'll get a link to that in the description down below. If you're learning about Perry for the first or third or 10th time, all of the links will be down below in the description, to their website, to their documentation, and to their communities. Join the Perry telegram and be part of this. What a great day to come on and drop me a little alpha, that this is the day a new product or a new feature launches. Got to lead with that next time, right? You come in, you lead hard with that. Hey, everybody.
00:19:45.094 - 00:19:52.810, Speaker A: Gareth, I appreciate you being here, man. We're going to sign off here in a little bit, but stay in touch with me. Let's do this again as you guys ramp up and move to different chains. Cool?
00:19:52.960 - 00:19:53.610, Speaker B: Sure.
00:19:53.760 - 00:20:10.094, Speaker A: Awesome, man. Thank you to the community for being here. I see one last minute question came in. Go to the telegram. Go to the Perry Telegram. This is where to ask those questions because we are wrapping up here. And while you're joining Telegram groups, join the Chainlink official telegram and discord as well.
00:20:10.094 - 00:20:39.250, Speaker A: Be a part of our community as we help projects like Perry adopt price feeds, VRF, and all sorts of other chain link products that help secure the entire DFI ecosystem as we work to change things in the financial world. Again, my name is Andy Boyan. This has been chain link live. I need you to like and subscribe this video. And I'm doing another one of these later today at 01:00 p.m.. Eastern. I'm talking to a pretty interesting project, sportimon.
00:20:39.250 - 00:20:56.270, Speaker A: Go. It's a wild founder. They got some crazy promotion stuff they're doing. So join me and then join me next week. We'll have a lot of these throughout the week. We've also got a number of international Q, so make sure to check those out on our Chainlink community channel. And thanks for being part of our chainlink community.
00:20:56.270 - 00:20:59.200, Speaker A: Hey, Gareth, we'll talk to you next time we talk to you. Cool.
00:20:59.730 - 00:21:00.682, Speaker B: Thank you. Pleasure.
00:21:00.746 - 00:21:01.500, Speaker A: All right. Thanks, everyone.
