00:00:03.770 - 00:00:36.440, Speaker A: And now we have the pleasure to have Danielle from Synthetix and core contributor at Synthetics, and Ernesto, who's the co founder of BGG and used to be the CTO at Ave. Thank you very much, guys, for joining me here. Now, Daniel, I'll start with you and maybe some questions around synthetics. We just heard from Kane around how synthetics is going to leverage ECIIP. Could you tell us a bit more around how teleporters will work on the technical level?
00:00:36.970 - 00:01:49.662, Speaker B: Yeah, I can say a little bit about, you know, teleporters is like the thing we're kind of launching with today. And the thing that's kind of really special about it is with synthetics, we're able to sort of burn tokens, like the SUSD tokens on the source chain and then mint them on the destination chain. Most bridges that people usually think of these days, they have to have some liquidity available on the destination chain. So, like, if you're transferring, they have to have eth on the destination chain so they can unlock it and send it to you. So we don't have that limitation at synthetics because as long as you have the tokens on the source chain, we can just burn them and then mint them on the destination chain. That's really cool. But the problem with this is when you're just minting tokens on the destination chain, you can just mint whatever the bridge or whatever the cross chain tool you're using, it's going to tell you, like, mint this many tokens, and if a hacker is able to get in and, I don't know, modify that number or send untrusted requests, it's pretty bad.
00:01:49.662 - 00:01:55.390, Speaker B: So that's kind of why we're really excited about using CCIP.
00:01:56.210 - 00:02:13.970, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. I mean, the way we look at this, and one of the main things we wanted to address in the space is having secure cross chain, which can actually do mint and burn. Because right now, a lot of the cross chain systems rely on liquidity.
00:02:14.050 - 00:02:14.246, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:14.268 - 00:02:57.506, Speaker A: So you need to lock some assets on one chain and then you need liquidity on the other chain to actually do the transfer. And that's kind of the magical piece which security allows you to get. You can outdo mint and burn, but a mint and burn operation has a risk, you mentioned. So in order to do this, you need to have the security in place in order to basically give this right to the Oracle network. And the way we've architected the system, we can do mint and burn in a way that users don't take high risk. They're able to give this mint and burn access to node operators, which can unlock a ton of innovation and can make cross chain transfers so much more efficient. So, yeah, super excited to be working with you guys on this launch.
00:02:57.506 - 00:03:20.640, Speaker A: I think it's going to be a huge step forward to cross any kind of asset cross chain. Now, Ernesto, I'd love to hear a bit more from you around the use case for Aave portals. You guys are also using CCIP for governance across multiple ave instances. Please tell us more on how it.
00:03:22.450 - 00:04:33.186, Speaker C: I mean, I think better to start with. How is the story of like, with multi chain? So almost three years ago, I think we took the decision of expanding from ethereum to polygon and avalanche, when Polygon avalanche were just starting. At the same time, we wanted to keep decentralized control via a governance system for Abe to holders. And pretty soon we realized to have this governance system control in this other instance of Abe, maybe the infrastructure of bridging these decisions was not really there, or we needed to depend too much on particular entities. This just went to the next level because with Fab three, we expanded to multiple other networks. So l ones, l two s the same issue as before, in some cases even worse. There was not really the bridging infrastructure that we needed.
00:04:33.186 - 00:05:23.140, Speaker C: Because at the end of the day, like the teams developing other chains, bridging doesn't need to be part of that core infrastructure. We were quite limited on how we control from Ethereum, where the governance lives, all the instance of fabe. And then, yeah, we started to think about it more. And now we think that we found the solution. And it's like via using solid bridging infrastructure, that is more third party bridging infrastructure, like CCIP, we can add some level of abstraction to be able to fully control every deployment of AbE. With on chain governance, which is the ideal of decentralization, that is the core idea.
00:05:23.670 - 00:05:58.494, Speaker A: Perfect. That's a really cool use case. I think what we're seeing more and more in the space is multiple instances of the same protocol living on different chains. And right now, what you need to get to, which is basically our first step working with you guys, there is a unified view of any protocol, doesn't matter which chains are deployed on. Meaning if I deploy Ave on ten different chains, I have the same rules on these ten different chains, I have a unified state basically of my protocol. And that's kind of what you're pioneering here. It's one step forward towards this, which I think the space really needs.
00:05:58.532 - 00:05:58.686, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:58.708 - 00:06:23.318, Speaker A: If I go on avalanche and I use Aave and then I go on polygon and I use the same protocol, I do expect the same rules to be applied. Right. And that's really critical for user adoption. All right. Those are really two exciting use cases. I would love to hear more from you around security. So aven synthetics have been some of the oldest protocols in the space.
00:06:23.318 - 00:06:40.220, Speaker A: You guys build with security in mind, which is why you've been around for so long, right, working with us on all of that stuff. What do you think security from CCIP actually unlocks for the space? What type of innovation are you the most excited to see get?
00:06:42.370 - 00:07:49.570, Speaker C: I mean, without security, there is no permanent defi. There is no selling of the idea of the blockchain for the outside world that Sergey and King quite well explained about before. Obviously, in the case of, like, there is like, I don't know, maybe 7 billion, 8 billion of assets locked in a protocol across multi chains. So I think it's pretty obvious to understand why we need to be focusing on security, why we need to put a lot of attention to the, let's say, under the hood components that are not so fancy of Ave. And at the same time, yeah, if you consider all the instances together of Abe, the security to communicate between them, and especially to communicate decisions on them is completely fundamental. So I think the role of CCIP is completely central in the syst.
00:07:50.070 - 00:08:17.100, Speaker B: Yeah. And just as Cain mentioned, synthetics and chainlink go way back. And since we've been using Chainlink, we've always had a really good track record of very reliable oracles. Very reliable. Like the bespoke system that we had built for synthetics, v two x that Cain was talking about, that's been super reliable. So I think we can expect really good security from CCIP. And that's part of the reason we're really excited about doing that.
00:08:17.630 - 00:08:34.330, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. I mean, our philosophy since the very start, and by the way, our philosophy has been very driven by the two protocols on stage. Right, Synthesix Ave, because you guys were really some of the first ones, which explained to us and gave us a glimpse of what it is to be a defi developer.
00:08:34.410 - 00:08:34.702, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:34.756 - 00:09:47.158, Speaker A: What do we need to actually solve for you guys to be able to innovate? And I think, Ernesto, I think I remember a call two, three years ago where you basically told me, yeah, if I'd say fouracles, I would actually have peace of four years now. I would actually have peace of minds to build more stuff, to be able to have new architecture, new stuff that the space can use instead of worrying about security of my oracles constantly. So the same security we actually brought to the private space at the time almost four years ago, we now want to bring it to CCIP to cross chain so that developers don't have to worry every time they're launching a new feature. Is this piece of software secure? They can say, okay, that's shining CCIP, it's secure, it works, and now they have peace of mind to actually go and work on other things. So our work for a very long time now has been getting you guys to this place so you can actually pioneer and keep pushing the frontiers of what we do in crypto. That's very important for us and, yeah, couldn't be more proud to be launching this with both Synthetix and. All right, thank you, thank you.
00:09:47.158 - 00:09:52.100, Speaker A: And a big round of applause for Daniel and Ernesto who have been working super hard.
