00:00:50.170 - 00:01:13.710, Speaker A: Hi. Well, thank you so much for coming today. It's a bit there here today because of the strike, but thank you so much for making it. We're super excited. We have a very special guest today. It's Alex Adagi from BNB chain and binance labs. So it's very special moment for us.
00:01:13.710 - 00:01:48.286, Speaker A: So today we will talk about innovation, about what BNB chain will share their best practices and make sure you have questions. You have all the time in the world to grill, Alex. The best. You. Yes. But before we begin, Alex, if you could tell us a bit about yourself, about your journey to crypto, what brought you where you are now and how did that happen?
00:01:48.388 - 00:02:07.634, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks a lot. So, hi, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. Yeah. So I'd like to share my journey. How I came to work full time in crypto at the largest crypto organization there is. I started in traditional finance.
00:02:07.634 - 00:03:09.660, Speaker B: I used to work in investment banking in M A. Covering technology companies mostly. And it was kind of around that point that I started being more actively involved with crypto on kind of personal side, making personal investments. The reason for that was very simple. It was because in investment banking being on the private side, you're not allowed to invest in pretty much anything. So no stocks, no bonds, with some few exceptions, like market indices, which are super boring. That was the only thing, right? So came across Ethereum in 2016, went to the compliance team and asked, hey, can I invest in Ethereum? And they said, what the hell is this? So actually the question was, is this gambling? And I said, well, sort of.
00:03:09.660 - 00:03:55.640, Speaker B: It's a bet on the future. So, yeah, I took home pretty big chunk of my bonus money from investment banking and put it in Ethereum. So that went well, made a lot of money. But then 2017 came around, did very well. Like December 17 was, or actually all the way to January 18 was the peak bull market, right? But throughout 17, the ICO boom was unfolding and there were projects coming up every day. It was very hard to follow. And I invested in a lot of them, made a lot of money as well, but lost even more.
00:03:55.640 - 00:04:30.242, Speaker B: And I learned a lot. It was like a great learning experience at that point. There were no decentralized exchanges. There were a bunch of centralized ones, but they're kind of clunky. It was a completely different sort of space as well. So it's actually very surprising how quickly everything changed from 20 from the previous cycle to this one. The number of people that joined, also the credibility that the industry got.
00:04:30.242 - 00:05:07.262, Speaker B: So, for example, in 2017, there were a few people at my employer, and I was working from one of the largest investment banks around that were interested in crypto, but it was very hushed down. People weren't. If you were doing crypto in 17, you were looked at in a very funny way. People thought you were like, either special or. Yeah, it was a completely different sort of credibility attached to the industry and vibe as well.
00:05:07.316 - 00:05:07.726, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:07.828 - 00:05:08.238, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:08.324 - 00:05:12.670, Speaker A: And now it's less so crypto and more so blockchain.
00:05:13.730 - 00:05:40.342, Speaker B: Right. And now even my previous employer is doing that. Right. They have a desk, they have a team that covers it. So they're trading some of the assets. On the wealth management side, their clients have been asking to provide services to get exposure to digital assets. And it's a completely different world.
00:05:40.342 - 00:06:00.800, Speaker B: And I think as we go into the future, it's going to be even more exciting. And I look forward to see who are the winners that will come out of this bear market, because there's going to be some very interesting projects that will come out and are currently being built.
00:06:01.970 - 00:06:47.870, Speaker A: Absolutely. And today we're talking about innovation, and it's all about, yes, what will come out, out of these two, three years and which industries will be disrupted and so on. But before we go deeper into innovation, let's just establish what innovation is. This is something I'm studying in my uni right now. And first thing, when they started talking about it, they said, let's make sure we understand what innovation is and that it is not equal to invention. So what do we understand under innovation in the blockchain space, in your opinion?
00:06:48.370 - 00:07:33.194, Speaker B: Yeah, I think to me, it seems that innovation has been used quite a lot, especially in Twitter debates these days. People are trying to argue for a lot of the use cases which might seem innovative on the surface, but they're not. Right. They're just a reinvention of old ways that don't work as well. I think the true innovation comes with mass adoption of technology. So when something is really innovative, it creates a lot of value. And that's what we've seen with some of the use cases is from the previous cycle.
00:07:33.194 - 00:08:07.410, Speaker B: So, for example, chain link is one. Right. That's something that. And I remember this quite well, because in 2017, there were no oracles. Oracles was not a concept at the beginning of the previous cycle. Right. But if you wanted to have projects that rely on physical, natural data, it was very hard to feed that data into whatever decision or logic you wanted to put through.
00:08:07.410 - 00:08:57.014, Speaker B: So people were using were like scrapping websites and taking centralized data, which was not really cleaned. It was very poor quality. And a lot of those projects blew up because the premise of those, for example, remember some projects, again, from personal experience on sports betting, there was no data which came from a trusted source. They were like scrapping it from BBC. And then BBC went down for the data feed was wrong. And then the logic of some of those sports betting got decided based on wrong data. And it gets written to the blockchain and that's it.
00:08:57.014 - 00:10:12.670, Speaker B: You can't reverse it, so the whole thing disappears. Back then, the industry needed an oracle, or the concept of an oracle, and that's how we came up with innovation, right? So we decided that it's time that there is a way to feed data. And one of the first ones were feeding, like crypto pricing data, right? So it's actually a very easy question to ask, what's the price of bitcoin? But how many of you can answer, what is the actual price of bitcoin? The underlying answer is actually a bit more complex, right. And there is different ways to approach it. But is it the price that's listed on binance, or is it like Coinbase? Or is it on a dex? Or what is it? Right. So if you start making applications that rely on that answer, you better have a very good way to provide that answer. Right? So you need an innovative way to go about it and not just block it from a random source.
00:10:12.670 - 00:10:54.254, Speaker B: And we've been through that because relying on feeding data from centralized sources can break quite often. So you rely on this single point of failure. You get a single point of failure at the worst time. So, yeah, the price of bitcoin can be an average of all of those. It could be a median of those. It could be another definition that you want to establish for yourself or for the project. But there is a lot of sort of thinking that went behind it to make that simple question have a very reliable answer.
00:10:54.254 - 00:10:55.626, Speaker B: So that's innovation.
00:10:55.738 - 00:11:09.858, Speaker A: And that we had that situation when one of the websites was showing that bitcoin cost $50 million and it only lasted like 1 hour or two. But, yeah, it caused a lot of trouble to many people.
00:11:09.944 - 00:11:51.600, Speaker B: Exactly. Imagine, like if you make a bet through some financial derivative, and that platform where you made the bet has, and you made the bet on the other side, right, you thought the bitcoin will be lower, so you get liquidated because of some error in the data feed. Well, it's actually not the case. Right. So you need that. And now I think as we go into the future, there's going to be a lot more applications having reliable data feeds, not just for prices. We'll talk about prices and how they relate to BNB chain, but for anything like weather data.
00:11:51.600 - 00:12:14.322, Speaker B: That's interesting. It could be stock data. Again, where do you take it? It's a very interesting question to have as well. And there's going to be a lot more use cases where very simple questions have not so simple answers.
00:12:14.466 - 00:13:10.758, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all on the surface and it all looks very easy. Exactly your point. And another like to switch gears here and to talk more about innovation. When we see new projects, they're coming up every day. And Amazon, Twitter, they're happening pretty much every hour, depending how many accounts you follow. But what end consumers? Us as end consumers, what we don't see is how much work is actually put into getting those projects off the ground. We've barely scratched the surface about how oracles empower projects, but also finding smart contract developers or finding the right platform, finding the idea that is innovative enough to capture people's attention.
00:13:10.758 - 00:13:24.990, Speaker A: So maybe you could walk us through how it works at BNB chain and how it empowers innovation. Exactly the topic of our discussion. Maybe a few examples.
00:13:25.490 - 00:14:30.382, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I think I'd like to approach this from kind of the beginning of BNB chain, or the way it used to be called BSE, which stands for binance smart chain. So this was launched as a sort of more of an experimental initiative back in 2020. At that point, there weren't a lot of layer one chains besides Ethereum. And in fact, the BNB chain when it launched was the first chain that got such a huge adoption in such a short amount of time because it was relying on Ethereum. Right? So it's an EVM chain, and we love Ethereum a lot because it's a great team with a lot of great innovation behind them as well. But I think the issue that they had, and still have is the cost of admission.
00:14:30.382 - 00:15:33.334, Speaker B: If you want to participate in the Ethereum network, you have to pay a high price, both in terms of the transaction fee, but also the time. So if you can afford that, that's great. But the idea behind BNB chain is that it has to be scalable so it can attract millions of users, and we're looking for mass adoption. So that was the premise how BNB chain came about, and that empowered a lot of people to come on. Now, one side is obviously the demand function of this, which is demand from users for highly scalable, very cheap, very fast layer ones. But at the same time, we had to attract developers to develop gray projects. And in fact, actually that's the main thing that you should start with.
00:15:33.334 - 00:17:08.614, Speaker B: Like having great projects will probably attract more users, which then will attract more developers to build, and then you create this virtual cycle. So we had some great projects from the very beginning. One of them still is Pancakeswap is probably the largest DeFi protocol around, but the largest on BNB chain. And alongside Pancakeswap came a lot of other projects because they ultimately had this very large, very engaged user base that came with it. So just to give you a few figures on that level, at the peak time, the transactions that were taking place on BNB chain were a factor, like an order of magnitude higher than Ethereum, and it was double the amount of daily active users than Ethereum. Now the TVL is a different story because there is more TVL stored on Ethereum, but the actual usage of the network was way higher than what we've seen anywhere. And there are other layer ones that claim to be able to support millions of users, but actual, in live, in actual real time use case no one has reached that.
00:17:08.614 - 00:17:37.182, Speaker B: So we managed to get to 2 million daily active users on the network around November last year. I think that was the peak. And the network had zero downtime. Actually, since the inception, it had zero downtime. So highly scalable, very high performance, and no downtime at all. That's what enables. But what we have in stock for the future is a lot more.
00:17:37.182 - 00:18:29.518, Speaker B: And this is how you actually enable a lot of adoption, is by having very performant and reliable infrastructure. And we'll bring chainlink into the picture in a bit. But Chainlink is also a very core part of the whole infrastructure set of, of the crypto industry. So in order to have that adoption and innovation on top of BNB chain, you have to have this very reliable performance that never goes down. Actually, network downtime should not be a thing in blockchain because of decentralization. That just should not be a concept. Likewise, DDoS attacks on a blockchain should not be a thing.
00:18:29.518 - 00:18:51.350, Speaker B: This combination of words should not exist. And when we hear some references that this layer one chain has been attacked and it had like a denial of service, every time I read that, I immediately think that this is not a layer one chain. Well, at least it's not a blockchain in the sense, in the true sense of decentralization.
00:18:54.730 - 00:19:32.930, Speaker A: So when we talk about launching a project on BNB chain, and we all know that every layer one, as you said, quite rightly, needs adoption, and almost all layer ones. They support that adoption. And they have numerous programs to boost and attract more smart contract developers, more projects. And what does BNB chain do in that department?
00:19:33.750 - 00:19:38.790, Speaker B: Great question. Now we're going a little smart contract developers here.
00:19:38.860 - 00:19:42.440, Speaker A: I'm sure they would be super interested to learn.
00:19:44.250 - 00:20:11.018, Speaker B: Amazing. So we start building blocks, right? So first thing we established that we have a great infrastructure layer. So that never goes down. It's very cheap. So you rely on that set of facts and then we add another set of incentives for you to build on BNB chain. And we have a lot of those. So number one is that the BNB chain was launched with a lot of support from Binance.
00:20:11.018 - 00:21:03.440, Speaker B: It's a decentralized chain. It operates fully with its set of validators. And yeah, it's decentralized and highly performant. But we offer from binance side. But also together with the BNB chain team, we offer a lot of support, which is not limited to opening up the access to the entire binance ecosystem through introductions, through investments. I actually sit in the investment team at Binance and we look for great projects that build on BNB chain. So investments for great teams is always available.
00:21:03.440 - 00:21:39.894, Speaker B: But we also have very dedicated programs. One of them is the most valuable builder program. And that's one of the two incubation and accelerator programs that we have internally. The MVB is running, currently in its fifth iteration. Every time it gets bigger and bigger, we have hundreds of applications from different teams. And there are a few things that I want to mention here. And number one is that we're looking for projects that build or want to build on BNB chain.
00:21:39.894 - 00:22:34.474, Speaker B: So have an interest launching their project on BNB chain. They're somewhat early in their journey, although we don't have a specific stage. We can really look at projects across stages from not yet deployed to someone who has an MVP or is in testnet mode, or to someone who is actually already deployed. And they're kind of seeing very early stages of traction and they just want to get a lot more. And this a lot more includes getting coaching, getting access to different teams within BNB chain and binance. So that could be someone from the BD side, it could be someone from security technology. We make introductions from various verticals within the crypto industry.
00:22:34.474 - 00:23:32.080, Speaker B: So we have partners like Chainlink, for example. We have partners in the security audit space. We bring experts that know everything about what it means to have a secure protocol. They share their knowledge how you should think about security audits. We make introductions to prior winners of our incubation program. So you could imagine that someone who participated in the first cohort, they've had quite a lot of growth and they also learned a lot along the way. So we invite them over to the latest iterations of the program for them to share all their knowledge and experience that they've had along the way and what it means for them to build on BNB chain and basically answer any questions that the new incomers have.
00:23:32.080 - 00:24:09.260, Speaker B: And then lastly, we also offer investment to projects that are interested. And there is a mutual kind of fit for us to invest. And that's not just limited to us, to our team. We also make introductions to external investors that we have very good relationships with. By the way, we're still taking applications for MVB five. If you run your own project, you can still go ahead. Just Google MVB five application.
00:24:09.260 - 00:24:17.920, Speaker B: There will be a Google form that will show up. Feel free to send and express your interest. We read every single application.
00:24:19.570 - 00:24:28.900, Speaker A: Awesome. MVP is like a wordplay with MVP, which is minimum viable product.
00:24:31.430 - 00:24:33.982, Speaker B: It stands for a most valuable builder.
00:24:34.126 - 00:25:22.130, Speaker A: Okay, I figured there was some words between the two. And always, always we are interested. What's your take on what will be the projects that we haven't seen yet? What will be the industries that will disrupt next? Someone said, very interesting thought. It's quite obvious when you read it, but when I read it first, it was so profound. In two years, smart contract developers basically reinvented finance, the whole financial industry in two years. And it's been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. So who do you think is next on our plate?
00:25:22.790 - 00:26:08.130, Speaker B: That's a very good question. If I were an oracle in the traditional sense, the definition of this word, I would be probably the best investor there is. But I'm not. So I try to stay in the human world and make decisions with incomplete information. I think finance is not yet done being decentralized and being disrupted. But you're definitely right about how much innovation we've seen. And I think I always go back to similar conclusion that you had, that finance and capital markets have been around for ages.
00:26:08.130 - 00:26:52.154, Speaker B: I think at the very least from kind of 17th century when the very primitive capital market started to pop up. And then DFI came along and said, well, we actually can do a lot more here. So that's how we got liquidity pools, which was a very interesting, I guess innovation as well as invention. I mean, it was invented some time ago. There were academic papers about it. There's actually a lot of the innovation that we're seeing right now in DeFi has been written about by academics. It was just like put in a drawer somewhere and everyone forgot.
00:26:52.154 - 00:27:35.086, Speaker B: Like someone wrote their PhD thesis or their master thesis, and no one used it because it's very hard to change stuff in traditional finance. Like, if you go to the New York Stock Exchange and say, hey, let's use liquidity pools instead of, like, order books, I think they'll show you the room, the exit to the room, but uniswap for ambulance. But uniswap is not the New York Stock Exchange. So they said, yeah, let's go. Let's do it. So you create this liquidity pools. You put two assets, like one apple, two oranges, and now you have a price, which is established through a completely different mechanism where it's a ratio between those two.
00:27:35.086 - 00:28:24.890, Speaker B: And it's very fascinating how it works, because you have marketplaces like binance, for example, uses order books. You have decentralized ones, like DYDX, have also use order books. You have uniswap, use liquidity pools. You have others that use differential curves. It can become very complex as well, which is great because it allows for application of this untested mechanism. Uses use cases to be tried out in the open. And if it were not for the crypto industry and for the technology behind for blockchain, this would have been left at the academic paper stage for forever.
00:28:24.890 - 00:28:59.820, Speaker B: So now we can see a lot of that being brought up from a lot of brain power and time that has been put into a lot of this mathematical finance. And even before crypto was around, people were thinking about them, and they just bring them into actual use cases. Some of them will probably fail, maybe most of them will. But what sticks around is going to disrupt the next sort of phase of disruption, which will likely create a lot of value for whoever does it.
00:29:00.510 - 00:29:27.410, Speaker A: Which industries do you have in mind? Surely BNB chain and binance labs, and at large. Think about, okay, should we think about insurance five years down the line, or should we think about, I don't know, supply, commodities, supply chains? What is it that you're looking for? Maybe that isn't there yet in terms of projects.
00:29:29.430 - 00:30:41.202, Speaker B: Yes. So, to go and be more specific within finance, I think we're still looking for interesting projects that look at building derivatives, like decentralized derivatives. Insurance is a very interesting use case that hasn't been really solved in crypto. In fact, most of the insurance protocols that we currently have are very limited in scope. And I think, unlike other areas of finance, insurance is still very much reliant on the same traditional model where you collect premiums to create this security as this fund that will allow you to cover unlikely events when an insurance event is triggered. Right. And in crypto, that doesn't work law, because the level of volatility and what people think are black swan events, they happen almost like on a weekly basis.
00:30:41.202 - 00:31:30.594, Speaker B: Right. So especially over the past month or so. So you can't really use the same traditional insurance model to assess the risk and price the risk accurately. So we're looking for more innovative projects in the insurance space as well. I think we've had the first wave of gamefi projects, which was not around in the previous cycle, and this one has showed us that there is some use case, although the quality of the projects that we've seen are somewhat limited. So I think gaming and the entertainment space is very prone for disruption. As I mentioned, it's just the very beginning of that phase.
00:31:30.594 - 00:33:05.880, Speaker B: So we're looking for projects that actually cater to make very engaging experiences, very fun for users to play more than actual financial reward. So that's something which we're looking for a lot. And then I think on the infrastructure side, we're very keen to find any sort of solutions that allow you to become either faster, cheaper or more secure. And ideally all of those three in one solution. And we've seen a lot of talk about optimistic roll ups and zero knowledge proofs, but I think this technology is yet to be kind of to see a mass adoption. And when we get there, and we can talk a bit more about BNB chain and what we do in that space, but I think when we get there, it's going to unlock a lot more infrastructure use cases that we haven't really thought about them yet, but because it's so cheap, fast and secure, it actually becomes much more viable. So some of these use cases, actually, I would not be able even to contemplate them what they would be right now.
00:33:06.890 - 00:33:08.970, Speaker A: That sounds really exciting.
00:33:09.790 - 00:34:19.214, Speaker B: Yeah. On BNB chain, we realized something very early on, is that if you want to have mass adoption, you actually need to have the infrastructure for mass adoption. So we actually seen the development of the project that I mentioned, the very first one in the gamefly space. The playturn was axio Infinity because it was so successful. It was taking close to 50% of the entire Ethereum network, which was obviously not viable. Like the gas fees were going up, network was very clogged, and they decided to spin up a side chain and put all the users on that side chain. So what that means is that even, and I think now as well with most of the chains, even if you say that you want to have this mass adoption, like very high transaction throughput projects, it's very likely that the infrastructure behind it would not support it.
00:34:19.214 - 00:35:10.298, Speaker B: So imagine like if we launch an application today and tomorrow a million users show up, you're going to have very difficult problem to solve in terms of scalability. If you were to do that on AWS or any centralized solutions, that would be the best of your problems. I mean, it would be a great problem to have because it's very easily solvable, right? So we want to get there as well. And that's what we're doing. On BNB chain, we've introduced a few scaling measures. One of them is actually already being rolled out with a few partners of ours. So we've introduced the BNB chains, side chains.
00:35:10.298 - 00:36:13.010, Speaker B: So they are dedicated side chains for applications. There could be an infinity of them. I mean, right now we're working with a few partners to roll those out. But in essence, what that is, is you basically can create your own side chain which has its own validators, you can configure them, it has its own gas fee, and you can even set your own token for gas to be paid in that token. Those are permissioned side chains. So it allows you to really offload. If you have an application, you run it centrally, you run it on the main BNB chain, you can offload some parts of the application to run on a side chain and it makes the whole thing much cheaper, much faster and much more scalable to the tune that you can have like millions and millions of users, which you cannot do on other layer ones as easily.
00:36:13.010 - 00:36:32.220, Speaker B: Then we also introduced, we're actually going to roll this out at some point in the near future. There will be a BNB chain, zero knowledge roll ups as well.
00:36:34.430 - 00:36:37.260, Speaker A: Big alpha here. Pay attention people.
00:36:39.150 - 00:37:16.626, Speaker B: So that is going to make it even more scalable. So just to give you a sense, on the Ethereum network, you have block times of around like 13 to 15 seconds. On BnB chain it's about 3 seconds. On the side chain is even lower. And the gas fees on Ethereum at some point they're like $200 to sign. One transaction on BNB chain there were thirty cents. I think that was the peak.
00:37:16.626 - 00:38:10.970, Speaker B: And then on the side chain you can set them to whatever you want as long as it's not zero. So it can be just above zero or near zero. And then zk roll ups, they're almost gasless as well. So it makes the whole thing so much more scalable. Again, as we go out of this cycle, we'll have a lot more projects that will try to build for mass adoption. And I think the number of people that are using wallets generally is probably somewhere in between 305 hundred. And our goal at BNB chain, and also binance labs, is to have at least 1 billion users like crypto adopters in the next year or so.
00:38:10.970 - 00:38:15.660, Speaker B: So that's a big goal. And the only way to do it is if you have the right infrastructure behind it.
00:38:16.350 - 00:38:19.660, Speaker A: That's a big pair of shoes to fill. Wow.
00:38:21.330 - 00:38:26.826, Speaker B: And just to add here how we work together with Chainlink, I think Chainlink.
00:38:26.858 - 00:38:27.440, Speaker C: Is.
00:38:29.330 - 00:39:24.100, Speaker B: We'Ve had a great relationship and partnership. I believe that BNB chain is the second largest or second most active chain that works with chain link. There's about 140 or just shy of 150 assets that are tracked by chain link. So that you can actually get the price feeds for those. And we see a lot of projects asking us, is this asset supported by Chainlink? So there is a lot of synergy, if I can call it that, having this very close partnership with Chainlink, because it offers us the possibility to enable other projects to build on top of BNB chain while using some of.
00:39:27.430 - 00:39:27.794, Speaker C: The.
00:39:27.832 - 00:39:52.540, Speaker B: Features that Chainlink offers to them by virtue of providing, for example, price fees. Not only this is one of them, you guys do a lot more than that, but this is one of the most requested feature. And the more we have, the better. I think Ethereum probably has doubled that. So we want to together and probably even more.
00:39:54.590 - 00:40:20.020, Speaker A: Thank you. And I'm sure there is a lot of questions in the audience. If someone is ready with their questions, we can begin taking questions. There's a moment. Do we have any question?
00:40:31.750 - 00:40:39.260, Speaker D: Hey, Alex. So you said you would like to see insurance and derivatives projects on BNB. This is the ones that you invest in.
00:40:40.430 - 00:41:32.778, Speaker B: Those were kind of a few of them, but we can talk a lot more through the entire list of areas that we'd be interested in. I think from our incubation program, we really look at everything. There is no specific sort of guidance that there is in terms of where this project should focus on. That's how we actually find some very interesting use cases is by having the really open to anyone who has an idea and really wants to build on BNB chain. So for our incubation program, it could be literally anything starting from DeFi, Gamefi, social fi, metaverse. Yeah, like infrastructure. Absolutely.
00:41:32.778 - 00:42:00.018, Speaker B: Every single area that you think that you'd be interested in, in the MVB program, we accept applications. Some of the things that we mentioned were more about where we think that kind of the next wave of innovation might come. But that doesn't mean that that's just like limited to those areas. Those were just a few that I mentioned, among others.
00:42:00.184 - 00:42:05.958, Speaker D: Okay, so you said about the MVB program that somebody, you are reading each application.
00:42:06.124 - 00:42:06.598, Speaker B: Yes.
00:42:06.684 - 00:42:16.466, Speaker D: So if I submit my project game, somebody will reply, like why it's bad? Or you will just read it and nobody will reply.
00:42:16.658 - 00:42:37.450, Speaker B: So we have about five people on our team who look at that. We might reply if we have more questions, but at the very least you'll get an answer that you have not been selected.
00:42:37.610 - 00:42:40.474, Speaker D: Okay, so at least an answer, I have not been selected.
00:42:40.522 - 00:42:41.214, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:41.412 - 00:43:17.462, Speaker D: Thank you. Can I have more questions? So, about insurance. If you talk about insurance of crypto projects, it's extremely complicated because the risk is so high that the insurance premium would need to be like 80%. So that's why they are not there. So you're touching problematic stuff. Derivatives, people want derivatives of products which are strongly regulated, and you can go to jail for running them without regulations. So can you give a hint like what insurance projects would be viable and what derivatives project would be viable?
00:43:17.606 - 00:44:20.794, Speaker B: Right, that's a good question, yeah. With regards to regulatory aspect, I think we haven't got to a sort of clear, well defined framework. I think when it comes to centralized exchanges, there is more expectation about regulatory thing being kind of core to the operations. When I said about derivatives, it was more on the decentralized part. And I think that getting to a phase where the decentralized exchanges will be regulated, that might come as well. But I think as far as it stands right now, that's probably not going to be a major thing. And this is my personal opinion, I'm not a regulator, and as far as I would like to say that I know what the regulator will do, I can't.
00:44:20.794 - 00:45:21.780, Speaker B: But it seems like they're very focused on decentralized operations right now. So trying to regulate that part, and then by the time when they get to looking into decentralized projects, there might be a clear way and path how they do that. So for example, some of the decentralized exchanges, we'd like to see some of the kind of feature parity or functionality that you have with decentralized exchanges. So derivatives is one area. In fact, you had small features like setting limit orders that were not a thing on decentralized exchanges. And that came only in the last six months or so before when you go to binance and set an instruction. I want to buy bitcoin if it falls to X $1,000.
00:45:21.780 - 00:46:25.174, Speaker B: You could not do that on a decentralized, like on uniswap, that was not possible. You had to go and just physically press and sign the transaction. Right. So it's very small things like that that enable makes it much more viable and easier user experience for people to participate in the DeFi space. And I think we actually have a theme that we try to enable, and we call it the CDFI bridging decentralized finance to decentralized finance. And I think decentralized exchanges for the most of their history, which is very short in itself, were the main gateway for newcomers and early adopters to come to crypto. And DeFi is kind of the next level that you do.
00:46:25.174 - 00:47:24.730, Speaker B: After you kind of get your first intro into the crypto space, you try out the centralized exchanges, and then you might want to either learn something new or maybe your risk appetite goes up and then you want to participate in some interesting DeFi projects. So then you decide to join those, and then you find out that actually the experience sucks. So you go back to your centralized exchanges and keep trading with them. And that's not a bad thing. I mean, if that's what you want, that's great. But I think with that push there'll be a pull factor as well that will come and we'll see more tools around DeFi that will make it much easier, much safer, the UI, much more intuitive. The whole experience will be so great that it won't feel to you like the moment you open it, your brain will tell, oh, this is a scam.
00:47:24.730 - 00:47:45.310, Speaker B: You want the complete opposite to say, this is great, like experience. This is what I want to use to manage my personal finances. So I think we're seeing a lot of those tools being built right now, and I look forward to see what comes out on the other side of this downturn.
00:47:47.430 - 00:48:00.534, Speaker D: DydX is like the best one. Now they are launching on Cosmos, so they might be closer to BNB chain. Yes. Thank you, Alex. I can give some comments, but go.
00:48:00.572 - 00:48:02.520, Speaker B: Ahead, we have time, I think.
00:48:06.490 - 00:48:37.780, Speaker C: Thanks. Yeah, so as a non developer, as a person who is not technical at all, could you explain to me the difference your value proposition of BMB chain compared to other layer one solutions for developers and for users? Because there seem to be a plethora of layer one solutions that position themselves as cheaper ethereums and. Yeah, so what differentiates you guys, other than the monetary rewards that your team specifically can provide? What differentiates your value proposition, your network compared to others.
00:48:38.390 - 00:49:07.834, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. So some of the things I mentioned earlier I can just summarize very quickly, but some I want to kind of emphasize more. So first thing, just to summarize, BNB chain is highly scalable. It's very cheap, very fast, and we're working on it becoming even more scalable and more secure. So that's kind of fact. Right. So we established that.
00:49:07.834 - 00:50:36.678, Speaker B: And then the thing that we offer compared to other, even compared to Ethereum, is the largest community and the largest user base there is for any layer one. We're larger than Ethereum by a factor of two in terms of number of users or daily active users. And you can see that with a lot of the Gamefi projects, for example, we have very engaged, very active users. Yes, they don't have as much TVL behind them, which is kind of the value, if you can think of it like the amount of value that's locked in Ethereum versus the BNB chain. But they're a lot more engaged and they are trying out, they're interacting with all of the new projects that are launched on the BNB chain. And this is a massive benefit to anyone who wants to launch their project because they'll have a lot of very interested early adopters from day one. Especially if you talk to us and we invest or you participate in our incubation program, you'll have the full marketing support behind your project.
00:50:36.678 - 00:51:27.160, Speaker B: And we have millions of followers on our social media accounts. We have ton of great partnerships just like the one we have with Chainlink, with a lot of other core kind of infrastructure providers, investors. And we can make any of those connections sort of like in a second and just by being attached BNB chain having this special relationship with binance and binance being the largest crypto ecosystem, it offers a lot of value to any project, any founding team there is to build on BNB chain. So that's my answer.
00:51:27.870 - 00:51:28.780, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:51:31.790 - 00:52:16.466, Speaker E: Hi. I think probably for this question I would like to ask both of you because especially we have chain link here. So we have probably entered very bad bear market. And it seems like a lot of people now is asking what sort of real world problems that we're solving and is it necessary that a lot of problems have to be solved on chain? Because this question, probably both of you, because chain link is very important in terms of feeding real world data onto a chain. So what kind of the direction are you saying? In which sort of areas sector that you can see that these data from the real world coming to on chain and what kind of solutions to solve.
00:52:16.498 - 00:53:24.720, Speaker B: Them for both of you? Yeah. The use cases that you see being solved with blockchain are, I would class them in two parts. So you absolutely have projects which do not need a token or tokenomic model or even like a blockchain behind it. I think it might work thousand times better with a centralized SQL database behind it. And therefore the wrong reasons. And I think what a bear market does, it flushes out exactly those types of projects because they join crypto for the wrong reasons. Typically those are to make a quick buck or try and be out there in the kind of follow the hype curve and all of the other reasons that are not the right ones to build.
00:53:24.720 - 00:55:19.630, Speaker B: And at binance we actually have, we say that BNB stands for build and build. And I think this is the exactly time to do that. And whoever is passionate enough to build during a bear market will build for something that has great utility and will ultimately find a great product market fit. Not always, but if you really stick around for the right reason, I think you have a very kind of great chance to make it. Especially that there is a lot of support behind the projects that really build something innovative. So being more specific which areas we think, I think will benefit from actual real utility, just by the nature of blockchain and crypto, I think finance is still kind of the number one area where you'll see a lot more use cases that are being brought from kind of the traditional finance onto a decentralized finance and make it a lot easier to scale. For example, one area that I was looking at is doing percent cross border payments with kind of stable coins, for example, versus trying to send money even through fintech solutions like transferwise or revolut.
00:55:19.630 - 00:56:45.406, Speaker B: It covers a lot of the use cases, but you might have some edge case, which is either going to be very costly or a lot is going to be very slow. And in crypto, that's just not the case, because the entire kind of payments and rails are completely detached from the legacy banking system and you can just transfer value. For example, in stablecoins, there's a lot of comments on crypto not being the right unit of exchange because it's very volatile. But then we invented stable coins, right? So those are attached to just kind of, they have a reference price, and they typically don't deviate unless they're kind of algorithmically enabled. Those do blow up, as we've seen recently. But even that, I think we still haven't answered if someone asked right now whether algorithmic stable coins is a dead end, I'm not sure what the answer is, because we've just tested kind of one or maybe two frameworks, and that didn't work out and it created a lot of value destruction. So maybe we should try another model.
00:56:45.406 - 00:58:09.770, Speaker B: But I think the iterative approach to innovation is going to get us to ultimately a solution which is very efficient, but nevertheless, you have, for example, fiat backed stable coins, which are quite, they enabled a lot of use cases which traditional banking system was not able to do. They're very cheap to operate if done in the right way. Even in the current regulatory framework, which was not devised to have stablecoins, some projects found a way to have operating stable coins that are regulated, that are highly transparent. They have audits behind them, and it enabled some great use cases which were, again, they were not possible with traditional banking rails. And we're going to see a lot more in that space. I think especially that we have clear regulatory framework, what it means to have a stable coin, kind of what reserves you can have behind them, and so on. So when we go out of this bear market, we'll have a ton of really great payments, like account to account payments solutions.
00:58:09.770 - 00:58:43.300, Speaker B: Again, cross border, detached from the current card networks, detached from the entire kind of banking infrastructure. You will not need all of this allegedly new innovation, like open banking initiatives, sharing APIs, sharing the infrastructure, because you have a totally new infrastructure that is just much more superior to operate and use. So that's one example.
00:58:52.570 - 01:00:03.630, Speaker A: I think Alex gave a very detailed question, and I completely agree with everything he said. What I would add, it's an ongoing conversation, what should or shouldn't be on chain. But there is also a conversation about what should or shouldn't be decentralized, because there can be permissioned blockchains, and a lot of enterprises are using it for their business goals. Does everything have to be decentralized? Maybe not. And if you want it decentralized, there are so many questions that arise about privacy, about verifications, a lot of other things, depending on which industry we are talking about here. But one thing for sure, that a blockchain, permissioned or permissionless, will definitely improve efficiency, whichever industry it is. So that's my $0.05.
01:00:11.880 - 01:00:45.996, Speaker D: Isn't decentralization like the main value of blockchain? Okay, so we've got, I see two use cases for crypto and blockchains. Money goes up, people have fun, and decentralization. If blockchain is centralized, why not just put it on? Aws, and have it 1000 times cheaper. Cheaper. So like really, 21 proof of authority validators is not very decentralized. So sorry, I just don't agree with that. Not all solutions have to be decentralized.
01:00:45.996 - 01:00:50.850, Speaker D: It's the biggest value of blockchains, I would say.
01:00:54.020 - 01:00:55.410, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, go ahead.
01:00:55.880 - 01:01:57.716, Speaker A: I'm sorry, I probably haven't phrased it correctly. What I meant was permissioned or permissionless enterprises will probably want to have their businesses restructured on permissioned blockchains to preserve their privacy. But of course, decentralization is what we are here for. Absolutely. What I'm saying is that should we talk in terms of what needs or doesn't need to be decentralized versus which type of blockchain should each, I don't know, use case have permissioned or permissionless? And I was mainly referring to enterprises, Lufthansa, a number of banks. They're using blockchain for some parts of their infrastructure, and more likely than not, it will stay permissioned. That's what I was referring to.
01:01:57.716 - 01:01:59.000, Speaker A: I just want to clarify.
01:01:59.660 - 01:02:00.888, Speaker D: Thank you. Sorry.
01:02:00.974 - 01:02:40.336, Speaker B: Yeah, I can add more. So I think there's huge value in decentralizing different processes or even organizations or entities. So I'll give you an example, which I've seen very recently. If you follow commodity markets, commodities went up a lot. If you look very closely to what happened with base metals. So nickel, copper, most of the volumes globally are traded here in London on the LME. And LME had a complete collapse in terms of settling transactions.
01:02:40.336 - 01:03:46.570, Speaker B: And actually, that's what happens when you have different kind of dislocations in the market, whether prices go up a lot, very short period of time, or go down a lot. So it's just not a good way to do it. Blockchain is a way more superior technology to settle those types of, they, they literally just stopped trading because they couldn't settle transactions. And Nickel went up a lot because there are some contracts that kind of blew up with the price going up. Blockchain doesn't care. It just executes the logic behind it and it settles the transactions in the way that they were meant to be settled any day of the week, any hour of the day. It just works.
01:03:46.570 - 01:04:57.568, Speaker B: And that's like just a much more spirit way to run things in finance. I mean, same thing with you had this interesting case with meme stocks and clearing settlement times, like with GameStop in January of last year, 2021. And the reason behind it, it was that you basically had transactions which had to be settled. Well, you do transactions kind of on almost like second or millisecond frame. So you have a set of shares that are being traded against an amount of dollars and you kind of think that that transaction is done, but it's actually not done. There's a lot that happens in kind of one day and a half after that, and you need to have the capital and you need to have the shares to clear the transaction. Right.
01:04:57.568 - 01:05:44.290, Speaker B: And this is just stupid. It takes you two days to clear something which is just like can be done on a blockchain in seconds. So again, this is much better technology that traditional finance is yet to implement for this kind of trades or for this kind of use cases. Again, if it's decentralized, no one cares if the price of GameStop goes to thousands or not. That's what it meant to be and that's what the logic behind. And those were kind of the rules of that marketplace. This is what is going to be executed and written to the blockchain, and that's it.
01:05:44.290 - 01:07:05.000, Speaker B: And I think this is a much better way to run things when you have that versus some obscure way to really like, you shut down part of the market, as it happened with the LME or with GameStop, you kind of disable some participants. I mean, it was done for the purpose of meeting the regulatory capital requirements, but those capital requirements were not needed in the first place. If you settle transaction the moment you actually buy or sell, which is exactly what's happening on blockchain, the transaction is settled the moment you execute and it settles very shortly after, not like one or two days after. So that's another use case. But there's a lot more which we can sit here and think about. And I'm sure after we'll go through a few of these iterations, we'll probably end up in a, in a place where blockchain will permeate a lot of these use cases just because it's a more superior technology. And whether that's a permissioned or like fully permissionless is yet to be seen.
01:07:05.000 - 01:07:12.920, Speaker B: But the underlying technology of blockchain is going to be quite disruptive for some of these processes.
01:07:15.500 - 01:07:16.650, Speaker A: Any other questions?
01:07:19.680 - 01:07:31.090, Speaker D: There's a good question on the future of crypto and where do you think, per se, when governments do try to regulate it? Where does binance and Chainlink actually stand on that point as well?
01:07:32.500 - 01:08:28.612, Speaker B: Right. So the question was with regards to regulation, where we stand, we stand the right side of regulation all the time. We work very closely with regulators in some countries already got fully licensed. For example, in France, we got a virtual asset provider license very recently. It enables us to provide the full suite of services on the centralized side. Similarly, in Italy, we work very closely in a lot of jurisdictions, including the UK. I think what's important is that the regulator have not just one, but all of the regulators show interest in coming up with a framework that is very clear, is easy to implement as well.
01:08:28.612 - 01:09:10.592, Speaker B: And I think all of the players in the crypto industry would just be very happy to play following those rules. I think we're way past the time when we actually need that regulatory direction, and some regulators have been quite active and have been a, have been working quite hard to provide that regulatory clarity. So from our end, we do everything possible in order to follow and implement all the regulatory requirements that are needed. So, yeah, that's my answer. Cool.
01:09:10.646 - 01:09:11.490, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:09:13.140 - 01:09:40.650, Speaker A: How does we switch gears once again? And if you have more questions than I'm sure you do, just come and speak to Alex and just network and enjoy yourself here. Grab some food, some beer, audio and let's chat. Thank you so much. It.
