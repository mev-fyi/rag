00:00:04.170 - 00:00:20.094, Speaker A: Excellent. Here we are. Well, hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning on this beautiful Thursday. I hope you're doing well. Right before we get started, just want to take kind of a few minutes to get everybody loaded in here. First thing I want to do is welcome Eric Anziani, the COO of crypto.com,
00:00:20.094 - 00:00:22.240, Speaker A: for joining us today. How are you doing?
00:00:23.250 - 00:00:25.462, Speaker B: Very good, thanks, Rory, for having us.
00:00:25.596 - 00:00:39.660, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. It's my pleasure. I know we were chatting just a little bit before, and you kind of mentioned that you were in Hong Kong. How are things in Hong Kong these days with sort of the virus and everything? Are things back to normal yet, or are people still kind of dealing with a lot of this stuff?
00:00:40.590 - 00:00:56.030, Speaker B: I think the situation is a little bit improving here, but I think people are very cautious. Everybody's wearing masks. There's still some restriction in place, but it's improving a little bit. So that's a positive note in this difficult yet we're all facing.
00:00:56.690 - 00:01:25.862, Speaker A: Exactly. I know. Hong Kong, I think, is one of the places in the world where people were a little bit more attuned to wearing a know, kind of in general, it's a little more natural here in Texas, where at. It took us people a long time to kind of get comfortable, know sort of that concept, and I think we still kind of struggle a little bit with it. So I always saw that that was one positive, at least. It's a lot of people, but people are a little bit more conscious of kind of being sick and wearing masks even before COVID Yeah, it's very true.
00:01:25.916 - 00:01:37.834, Speaker B: And I think SaaS also hit the region in Asia a few years back, so people were prepared a bit. They had gone through it once, and it was not really the case in Europe and us, so the learning curve was not there.
00:01:37.952 - 00:01:38.426, Speaker A: Got it?
00:01:38.448 - 00:01:38.646, Speaker B: Yep.
00:01:38.678 - 00:02:01.620, Speaker A: Perfect. Yep. Absolutely. Excellent. Well, we'll give it just one more minute. We got quite a few people in here already just to let them get started. Have you always been in Hong Kong, or did you kind of move there recently? What's kind of been your story in terms of where you've been at?
00:02:02.310 - 00:02:12.550, Speaker B: I've been in Asia for about ten years, spent a lot of time in Singapore, one year in Tokyo, and I've been two years now, two years plus in Hong Kong.
00:02:13.610 - 00:02:32.782, Speaker A: Okay. Well, then, yeah, certainly you've been in the region, it sounds like, at least for sure, for a. So. Excellent. Well, we'll go ahead and get started now that everybody's kind of joined us here and get this Q A rolling. So the first thing I would like to do is, again, thank everybody for joining us here today. I'd like to thank the crypto.com,
00:02:32.782 - 00:02:45.450, Speaker A: Chainlink and general blockchain community for joining us. Obviously, special thanks here to Eric Enziani, the COO for Crypto.com, for joining us today and spending his time with us. Thank you again for joining us, Eric.
00:02:45.610 - 00:02:47.670, Speaker B: That's my pleasure. Thanks for the invite.
00:02:47.850 - 00:03:23.318, Speaker A: Of course, just to go over, really, the kind of the goal of the Q and A is really to allow the wider community to learn more about the integration between crypto.com and chainlink along what makes crypto.com unique, why this relationship is beneficial to both teams, really. For the first 20 to 30 minutes, we're going to go over kind of a Q and a chat structure, what questions will be asked by myself. And then after that, again, if you have any questions that you'd like to ask, drop them in the YouTube. And if we are able to have any time and see any good questions in there, we're more than happy to kind of ask them as we finish things up. So again, Eric, thank you so much for joining us.
00:03:23.318 - 00:03:25.440, Speaker A: And if it's okay with you, we'll go ahead and get started.
00:03:26.370 - 00:03:27.774, Speaker B: Sounds good. Let's do it.
00:03:27.892 - 00:03:38.980, Speaker A: Perfect. So, Eric, first thing, would you mind maybe introducing yourself, what your role is with crypto.com? A little bit of your background, kind of. What is crypto.com? What is it building?
00:03:40.390 - 00:04:05.366, Speaker B: All right, so hi, everyone. I'm Eric Anziani. I'm the chief operating officer@crypto.com. So what does that mean? I look after several functions. I cover things like product blockchain strategy, sales research as well. And I've been in the tech fintech space for about ten years now. And before that I was in banking and strategy consulting.
00:04:05.366 - 00:04:29.550, Speaker B: So that's a little bit about myself. Let's talk about crypto.com. We are funded now. It's four years ago. So in 2016, and we started crypto.com with a very simple belief that it's a basic human right for everyone to control their money, data and identity. So I think for us, that was kind of the fundamental belief.
00:04:29.550 - 00:05:34.194, Speaker B: And we've seen in the last decade those rights kind of starting to erode. And in some markets, being clearly under threat. And the blockchain tech, the cryptocurrency built upon it, and the decentralized protocol built upon it, we felt could provide people with the ability to regain some of that control, the control over their money, the control of their data and identity. And that's why as a company, we wanted to, and we want to support blockchain technology adoption globally because we think it can help really make societies healthier and fairer. So we're trying to grow the space to make cryptocurrency more accessible, more usable, more value creating for everyone through our different sets of product and services. And that's why we've been very focused on making product that solve real customers problems. And we started with payments, making those digital asset, those cryptocurrency usable for day to day spending.
00:05:34.194 - 00:06:25.638, Speaker B: When you go to your coffee in the morning, you want to do online shopping, you should be able to use cryptocurrency and spend it instantly without thinking about it. That's why the first product that we launched was the Visa card, our first product in Singapore and then in Asia. After that we went to the US and then this year we rolled it out in Europe. That payment experience felt is a good use case for anyone to enter the space and discover what is crypto. So we spent some time rolling that out and then we build an ecosystem around it. So it's great to be able to spend your crypto, but how do you acquire crypto? How do you buy, how do you exchange crypto? So big barrier and challenge there. So we build a lot of connectivity with the fiat and the traditional world.
00:06:25.638 - 00:07:22.074, Speaker B: So anyone can buy cryptocurrencies through a bank transfer or credit debit card purchase at the best price. So we build all those connectivity in many different markets for euro, for USD, for AUD, for SGD, and we continue to do so to make that bridge between traditional finance, fiat word, and the crypto world easy and fee less. And then finally we extended our ecosystem to provide products that give, I would say, value on your crypto if you're not spending it. So like a credit product or interest earning product like crypto earn kind of complemented nicely the offering. So we give that ability for people to get more value out of their digital assets without actually spending it. And there's ways to do it in the CFI space. And then we did it with our crypto.com
00:07:22.074 - 00:07:47.010, Speaker B: app. But a big important part for us was to bring it also in the DFI space. And that's why earlier this year, we launched a DFI wallet and then built product on top of that. So, yeah, that's what we've been working on. I mean, if we look at where we are now, we have 3 million users on our platform, we have about 500 employees globally, and we're available in 90 markets.
00:07:47.670 - 00:08:29.440, Speaker A: Wow, pretty incredible. I think growth, and I love the approach of starting with something that most people understand, which is a credit card, and then kind of building on top of, okay, you can spend crypto and then okay, you can do some additional things, and then you have sort of DeFi coming in recently as of well, which has been obviously extremely popular. So it's been a very interesting approach, obviously tremendous growth with the amount of markets. Would love to know, do you kind of plan on is the goal right now just to continue to expand those markets, or are you focused really on kind of defi? Would just sort of love to understand how you sort of see the next steps here.
00:08:30.610 - 00:09:34.766, Speaker B: Sure. I think we have a few priorities right now. DeFi is definitely a big one. And we've started working in the space for quite some time now, and we started more with kind of research and content. So we have a university and we have also a research hub where we try to explain what was DeFi at the time and what does it mean to participate in the space, what are the risk, how to participate and how it will disrupt also the traditional world in a certain way. And we did also join collaboration, for example, with BCG Boston Consulting Group, one of the leading strategy firm, to also explain to the broader financial actors on what is the space, why is it growing so fast? What can they do? How can they participate? So that was really the first component in our DeFi priority, bringing the content, doing the research, and then building on top of that. We looked at how now we can bring it to customer and make know simple and accessible.
00:09:34.766 - 00:10:30.418, Speaker B: So we started with first DeFi wallet. So really a non custodial wallet that enables you to have that full control. Very in line also with our vision and start building decentralized financial services on top of that that can be used through the DFI wallet. Just a few weeks ago, we launched DFI Swap, which is a decentralized product that enables the exchange between ERC 20 tokens and Ethereum, and also enables users to get some yield farming opportunity been quite sought after in the last few weeks, but we built something that is sustainable in the long term and also leveraging our ecosystem, token CRO, to drive those rewards and those incentives. And there's a few more products that we're working on on the DeFi front. So really DeFi is a big topic for us. It's in line with our vision.
00:10:30.418 - 00:11:18.658, Speaker B: It's something we've worked on for a long time and will continue to work in the long time on because it's going to change the world, and the tech is not going to go away. So I think we're investing a lot in that space. To your questions, in terms of how we're looking in terms of expansion, I think there's still a few markets where we're not present and we want to expand a bit there, or at least bring some of our products. Our card is available in three continents, but, for example, we're bringing it to Canada. It's not yet there, and maybe Latam after that. So there's still markets for us where we can bring certain of our products, and we want to be a bit more local also, especially in the market where we have big communities. So we started to localize a bit our languages.
00:11:18.658 - 00:11:37.400, Speaker B: So we launched with the french language, we added Spanish, we added Korean recently. And we'll continue to bring more local experiences through language, currency, top up methods, things that really make the experience more relevant to our users wherever they live.
00:11:38.170 - 00:11:56.980, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Thank, thank you for that great, very detailed explanation that kind of segued naturally to what my next question was going to be was sort of how you view DfI. I know you answered sort of most of that, but it sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong here, that you view that as kind of a long term component of your strategy moving forward. Is that correct?
00:11:57.670 - 00:12:36.430, Speaker B: Definitely. I think the tech is very powerful. The use cases there will definitely disrupt the way traditional finance is run, and I think it really gives access to financial services to a much broader set of users. You just need a non custodial wallet and some crypto in it, and then you can participate, you can get a loan, you can borrow, you can exchange, and it's very easier in that sense, in terms of barriers, there's no credit check required and things like that for anyone to participate while you retain some level of control. So I think it's something that really speaks to us and our mission.
00:12:36.850 - 00:12:37.582, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect.
00:12:37.636 - 00:12:37.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:37.892 - 00:12:52.420, Speaker A: Thank you for that. And I guess then kind of at least the natural, there was a chainlink crypto.com integration announcement here. Would love to just explore that a little bit further and how you're utilizing kind of chainlink in your products.
00:12:53.910 - 00:13:46.498, Speaker B: Sure. Really happy to partner with Chainlink on this. The work that the team has done on the oracle front, I think is tremendously helpful for the ecosystem. And we wanted, of course, to leverage that good work, but also contribute in a way to make sure it continues to grow because it brings a lot of value. So we work with chainlinks, really on two types of integration. The first one is to be able to have our ecosystem token CRO with the price feed that any smart contracts can call and use for, whether it's borrowing, lending or other type of functions on Defi. And I think it's a very important foundational step for CRO to be more integrated, not necessarily within our own product, but within other partner protocols that are out there.
00:13:46.498 - 00:14:19.790, Speaker B: And I checked this morning, the first feed is live on the website. I was tweeting about it. So CRO ETH is live, which is great. And hopefully we'll have CRO USD as well coming up in the next few weeks. But I think it's a great first step for us to be able to leverage the technology and CRO to start integrating in more protocols and join the ecosystem more broadly of Defi. And then the second integration is how crypto.com, we can leverage those price feeds into our product.
00:14:19.790 - 00:14:57.434, Speaker B: And we felt integrating the price feed from Chainlink in our Defi wallet made a lot of sense because this is the place where people have full control, and having a transparent price data feed there made complete sense. And we already integrated on Dai, on link and a few tokens, and we're already sourcing. It's live in production. If you go and go to the Defi wallet, the price that you see there are coming already from the chain link, smart contracts and the price source there. So I think it's very important for us to give that transparency, especially in this kind of product. Perfect. Yeah.
00:14:57.472 - 00:15:23.934, Speaker A: Thank you for those details. And I think for a lot of people to understand, everything is always a process. You always start with one thing and then look to build and build and build as it sort of makes sense for both kind of projects to work and move forward. So as you mentioned, I think there's some great foundational steps that have been taking here and excited to see kind of what the future brings as you continuously roll out more Defi products and I'm sure more integrations with your defi wallet, there's always going to be opportunities.
00:15:23.982 - 00:15:34.470, Speaker B: For us there, definitely. And I always look at partnership in the long term and try to make them strategic, and I think chaining is a great partner.
00:15:34.890 - 00:15:52.954, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, perfect. Thank you for that. And always a pleasure to work with crypto.com as well. I'm always working kind of behind the scenes with a lot of different people, but you have a very professional team and have enjoyed kind of working with everybody. And special mention to April, who kind of helped get this sort of set up and created as well.
00:15:52.954 - 00:16:26.520, Speaker A: She's been working with me behind the scenes to do quite a few things, so just want to say thank her as well. Moving on to maybe your, I know you touch a little bit upon kind of your product roadmap here, but would just love maybe overall. So I know you mentioned getting in new markets, looking to get into defi, I guess. Is there anything else, maybe even long term, that you're sort of researching and exploring that looks interesting or have seen maybe some community interest in an area that you might be interested in exploring here in the near future?
00:16:27.850 - 00:17:08.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're very focused on, I would say, three main use cases and how we can bring exciting experiences around those. So the first one we touched upon is payment, and we talked about the Visa card, but we also have a QR code payment solution called crypto.com pay. So you just need your phone, you go on a merchant site, you just click on crypto.com pay, QR code shows up and you just scan it with your phone and make a transaction directly from the app. And it's very smooth and we're staying a lot of traction on this, but it's still an early product and we have to do the merchant acquisition. So this one is a five to ten years journey, and we want to bring five to 10 million merchants into this ecosystem.
00:17:08.370 - 00:18:25.790, Speaker B: So there's a very long term project and we're already integrating with Ledger, with traveler, with unstoppable domains, and we're extending this coverage. But it's a long term initiative that we want to push because it's a native crypto payment experience. The Visa card is great, but we still have to rely on the fiat work, and it's very important for us strategically to build the ecosystem, to drive that direct crypto experience for the payment use case. And then we have trading, the exchange and the buying of crypto, and the last one is the financial services, the growth, how do I get more value out of my crypto? And we touched upon the growth side with Defi, which is a new relay of that growth with more control for users. And on the training side, we launched not that long ago an exchange platform. It's still early stage, but it's been doing quite well, growing nicely, and there's a lot of things we can do on the product front there because it's just a spot exchange. So there's more opportunities to work with our advanced retail community, the traders, as well as institutional, and trying to offer product that meet their needs on that front and to ensure we can provide that deep liquidity that everybody needs, especially when they want to trade.
00:18:26.130 - 00:18:56.360, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Thank you. Again, very detailed explanations. Always appreciate that. Is there anything maybe for you personally that you find kind of really exciting going on in crypto.com that you think it'd be great for people to sort of explore more or that you wanted to let people kind of specifically know about? Obviously, I know we've talked about a lot of kind of high level, but anything maybe that sort of resonates with you, especially that, hey, this is new, I think, or we think people should really check this out.
00:18:58.250 - 00:19:40.580, Speaker B: Well, if you look at our monthly update on the product front, the list is always extremely long. So if I pick one, I don't know if the product team will be very happy, but there's a lot that we're doing. I think some of the cool stuff I find is making that crypto useful and usable. So I talk about pay and paying at merchants, but we also have the ability to buy gift cards as well as top up your mobile phone. So airtime, top up. And I feel those use cases are sometimes a little bit under the radar, but brings a lot of value. And we have some of the top brand and even Amazon and others available for purchase through pay.
00:19:40.580 - 00:20:05.870, Speaker B: You can spend your crypto and get them, and with great cash back, especially if you use our ecosystem token. So people that have discovered the feature use it quite a lot. And being able to top up your mobile phone, especially in markets where prepage is a bit more prevalent, is also quite powerful. So I think those are kind of two use cases that sometimes do not get on the front page, but quite powerful.
00:20:06.450 - 00:20:27.480, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. I always love to get into kind of more of a personal question to kind of find out a little bit about you when you're not working on crypto.com. And I feel like during these times, everybody's kind of working all day, every day because you can. But when you're not, is there any hobbies, any things you enjoy doing kind of around Hong Kong whenever you do have some free time?
00:20:28.890 - 00:20:55.258, Speaker B: Sure. I think it's quite interesting if I step back. I joined crypto.com three years ago, and before joining crypto.com, crypto was my hobby. So I was spending a lot of time reading white papers, trying different platforms. So then my work became something I was very excited about, which kind of reduced the spectrum of hobby because it mixed and it merged quite nicely.
00:20:55.258 - 00:21:22.166, Speaker B: But in general, I like exploring new things and I like experiences, and I'm quite a foodie. So I'll try to try new type of food, new restaurants. These days it's a bit harder. And I'm quite lucky to have amazing home cooked foods. I'm quite lucky for that. But it's something I like to explore and try different techniques, cooking style and type of food. So I really enjoy that.
00:21:22.348 - 00:21:59.314, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, no, I think that's a great. It's always interesting. And I was of a similar situation where what was first a hobby or an interest eventually turns into a job and a career. And then it's sort of that merging of, well, this used to be my hobby, now it's thought, and you either find something else or just, I guess really what you end up doing is just getting totally immersed in this space, which has definitely happened to me. Perfect. I know, to where it's like, well, what do you really do outside? It's like, well, I still read white papers and I still do those things like I used to do.
00:21:59.314 - 00:22:48.702, Speaker A: So I'm still learning about Defi and it's evolving just so quickly, which I think is incredible. And just like everything evolving so quickly, there's always that question of taking that measured approach and then that question of sort of moving quickly. And what I love, I think, for me personally, about the space, is you can do either teams can decide to take a really long term research, or teams can decide to move very quickly and take on kind of that risk that's associated with that. But it's like a permissionless, you can decide. And I think that's such a very powerful thing about blockchain and crypto in general is that the developers, the teams, can really decide how they want to kind of handle that and what they want to deliver to their users. So that's always intrigued me about the space, I guess. Finally here, moving forward, what's the best place to follow everything that crypto.com
00:22:48.702 - 00:22:55.940, Speaker A: is doing? What are kind of the best channels? People have been interested in this and they want to do some more research or join the community. What's the best way for them to do?
00:22:56.870 - 00:23:39.438, Speaker B: I mean, we have quite a few social media channels that people can kind of follow or join. I mean, Twitter is, of course, a big channel. We're also on Telegram. We have kind of a central group for everybody, and then we have per markets, I think about 50 different telegram groups, which are more for the local experiences that I was talking about. We do have a YouTube channel as well, and Instagram that people can follow our development and see the news or the progress in a slightly different lens and style. Of course, we have our university just go on crypto.com and check out university and our research hub where you can get a little bit more in depth analysis.
00:23:39.438 - 00:24:07.130, Speaker B: Especially on the topic of Defi. We have a very strong team that is producing a lot of content to decrypt the space and understand what people can do and what are the opportunities it always has to add some content because it's evolving very fast. Yes, that's an interesting one. So in general, I think those are kind of the key touch points for anyone who wants to learn more about crypto.com and what we do.
00:24:07.280 - 00:24:26.020, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Well, also what we'll do is at the bottom of this description of this video, we'll gather all those links. We'll have them there. So if you'd like to learn more, we'll make it really easy for you to do that and join some of these community channels. And then lastly, anything specifically that we weren't able to discuss or that we missed that you would like to talk about?
00:24:27.430 - 00:25:28.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I think maybe something that I haven't mentioned, which in the context of Defi, but in general is very important in our space, sometimes not necessarily the most fun topic, but looking at security and some compliance, as well as a foundation of what you do and have that in the back of the mind and also in the frameworks that you make decisions on, is very key because we're building a foundation here. The space is still very small. We have, what, 1% of the world's population using crypto, and so we need to build that trust, and there's a lot of trust barriers for anyone to join the space, and spending efforts and time to make sure we do things properly in the right way, I think is very important for the space in general. And as a company, we've invested a lot in that, and we'll continue to do so because it's a foundation and it's what will help us build and grow the space overall. So we can move to 500 million users, a billion user. That's what we're aiming for.
00:25:29.450 - 00:26:14.226, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. I think we're still so early, and I think we see so much progress. But at the same time, like you mentioned, it's 1% of people that are actively kind of engaged and then probably even a smaller percentage that are actively using defi products. And there's a lot of room for growth, I think, in almost every part of the space, from wallets to new financial products to, as you mentioned, sort of crypto.com, which is a place where it sounds like, where the idea is, you can almost do everything kind of a one stop shop for being able to really interact with kind of blockchain and crypto. So it's going to be exciting. I always love the saying, you overestimate what you're going to do in two years and underestimate what you're going to do in ten.
00:26:14.226 - 00:26:46.990, Speaker A: And I think we're very much there where the next couple of years are going to be pretty amazing. But ten years from now, I think things are going to look very different than they are today. And we're going to look back at these times and say, oh, wow, everything wasn't connected or you needed to do this and then this and then this. I think when we can really get that seamlessness where everything is no different, you're utilizing blockchain or crypto the same way that you do banks, you bank or you handle fiat, that will be a big step forward, and I think people will definitely want to use it when they see all the advantages.
00:26:47.330 - 00:26:51.918, Speaker B: It's definitely an exciting vision to perfect.
00:26:52.004 - 00:27:10.386, Speaker A: Well, Eric, again, thank you so much for joining us today. Again, the CEO of Crypto.com. Thank you again for the audiences. If you're from crypto.com or the chainly community or the blockchain community, thank you again for joining us. Put we'll have an updated description here shortly. Clean everything up.
