00:00:23.450 - 00:00:54.720, Speaker A: I joined the chain link community because I think, I really love the fact that a lot of their events, they're focused on creators and developers in the blockchain space. Right? And so I think trying to find a community of people who are interested in the technical side of it, or like the creator side of it, is actually pretty hard these days. And so I think Chainlink does a great job. They have focused discussions and panels on topics that I think are going to be really interesting for developers and creators and people creatives in this space.
00:00:59.090 - 00:01:17.766, Speaker B: I just think that Chainlink is bringing the instrumental technology for blockchain overall. And I wanted to meet people in that community, people who understand why it's important and talk to that people, because I think if people come here, it's going to be the right people.
00:01:17.868 - 00:01:44.320, Speaker C: I was just interested in investing and crypto in general. This is a good meetup, like a good event, to be honest. We were just talking before. We want to raise the awareness of this crypto and financial freedom for women, for women to get more involved in this. Yeah, that's what are we doing here.
00:01:45.010 - 00:01:50.378, Speaker B: And this has been definitely a very welcoming room to be a woman.
00:01:50.554 - 00:02:01.070, Speaker D: And it felt, it felt righteous.
00:02:09.370 - 00:02:43.806, Speaker E: So I originally joined the Chainlink community, actually specifically for the price oracles. I'm a huge fan of yield farming. And so literally, Chainlink is something that we use daily between all the different price feeds and automating aggregators and whatnot. So this is actually my first Chainlink event specifically in New York City. So it's awesome to be here, honestly. It's connecting with people that I genuinely speak to online that I've never met in person. So now to literally collab in person, see face to face, and basically to resonate over the commitment of this whole decentralized, interconnected economy is something we dream of.
00:02:43.806 - 00:02:47.070, Speaker E: So happy to be here and super excited to see this all come to fruition.
00:02:55.370 - 00:03:24.334, Speaker D: It's. Yeah. Okay, everybody, you're in this photo, so.
00:03:24.372 - 00:03:25.180, Speaker E: Get hyped for me, okay?
