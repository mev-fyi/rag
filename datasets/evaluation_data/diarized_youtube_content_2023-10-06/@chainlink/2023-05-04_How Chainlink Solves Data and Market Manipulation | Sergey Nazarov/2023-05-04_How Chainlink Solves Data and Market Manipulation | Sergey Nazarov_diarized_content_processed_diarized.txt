00:00:00.490 - 00:01:03.054, Speaker A: So the first thing that we did when we created Oracle networks was we solved this data and market manipulation issue by providing data that was truly reliable and able to be resistant to manipulation and resisted this conflict of interest problem. Even if you were a very big actor with a lot of money, even if you re a market maker or a hedge fund, you cannot go and manipulate the chainlink data source in order to steal and extract value from DeFi. And this is why DeFi is an alternative to that other world that I just explained, where that happens on a regular basis. And then it happens so much that there's a nice big scandal and everybody loses faith in the system. So the thing that we have is not the ability to recreate the existing financial system in a little small form where the same people get to steal money from a slightly different group of people. That's not very interesting to me. I'm not interested in spending the next ten years doing that.
00:01:03.054 - 00:01:30.020, Speaker A: I'm much more interested in there's an alternative financial system where nobody can steal from anyone else. And then when those people continue to steal in the traditional financial system, and it becomes obvious that they are, and they are, then everyone will migrate to this conflict of interest free alternative. So that's what we're building. That's what I think most of you are building, and that's what I think this is all about.
