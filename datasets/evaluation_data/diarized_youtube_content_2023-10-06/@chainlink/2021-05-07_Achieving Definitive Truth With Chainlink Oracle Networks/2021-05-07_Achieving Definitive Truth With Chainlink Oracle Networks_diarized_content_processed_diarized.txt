00:00:00.570 - 00:01:32.980, Speaker A: We don't have a blockchain. There is no chainlink blockchain. What there is, is many, many oracle networks, right? So there's an oracle network for each individual piece of definitive truth, and then as users come and use that definitive truth, they each individually pay a small fee that's contributed to a shared pool to sustain the creation of that one individual piece of definitive truth. We're approaching now hundreds of Oracle networks, and then we're probably going far beyond that pretty quickly. In any case, the nature of Oracle networks is that they are spun up to solve specific problems, right? They're getting spun up to solve a specific problem about a specific piece of data, a specific data source, a specific answer to one piece of definitive truth, such as what is the bitcoin to USD price? What is the weather in a specific geographic location, what is the location of a certain collection of goods? And then they deliver that piece of definitive truth to a smart contract on one blockchain or multiple blockchains, and then that piece of definitive truth goes on to trigger those contracts. And the triggering of those tracks by that definitive truth is what gives them that reliability, which enables more and more value to be put into their control. Because the alternative is that somebody in some it department somewhere controls that contract, which is the way the world works now.
