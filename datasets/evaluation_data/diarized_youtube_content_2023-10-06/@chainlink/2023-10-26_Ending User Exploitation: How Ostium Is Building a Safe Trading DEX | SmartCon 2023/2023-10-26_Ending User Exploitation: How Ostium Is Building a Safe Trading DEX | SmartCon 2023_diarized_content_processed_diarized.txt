00:00:02.570 - 00:00:35.078, Speaker A: Hey, folks, as Josh mentioned, so I'm joined here by the founding team of Ostium, who are building an on chain RWA focused perpsdEx. The topic of the fireside chat that we're going through today is actually about how ostium is approaching eliminating user exploitation by building a PerpsdEx on chain that is focused on ensuring a safe trading environment for users on the platform. I'll hand over to the founding team to quickly introduce themselves and maybe give a quick rundown of osteom before we get started with the questions.
00:00:35.244 - 00:00:51.050, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Thank you, Hulk. I'm Calidora, co founder of Osteom Labs. As I think Halcyon greatly enumerated, we are building a PerpsDEX specifically focused on robot assets, starting with commodities and forex.
00:00:51.870 - 00:00:56.150, Speaker C: My name is Marco, and I'm the CTO at awesome.
00:00:56.240 - 00:01:48.894, Speaker A: Awesome. So, look, I think many of us in the room, maybe we can get a quick show of hands. How many of you have traded on chain before we've got any big defi users in the room? No, I think what's brought a number of us to this space has been the increased transparency that on chain trading enables the immutability of trading records on chain. And we still see, I suppose, the issues that exist with predatory trading in traditional finance and off chain trading. But I think people are maybe less familiar with some of the, apart from MeV, some of the predatory trading that goes on on chain at the expense of users who are looking to trade on these venues. So maybe to get started, if you could help me by kind of framing maybe a couple of the main examples of user exploitation on chain, I'm happy.
00:01:48.932 - 00:02:26.220, Speaker C: To start with that. Yeah, so I would say the two biggest realms of user exploitation in Defi protocols are the oracle front running side, where some traders have the ability to put on risk free trades and exploit the protocols through this temporal arbitrage, where they are able to see where the price of the oracle is going right and exploiting and hurting lps in the process. And the second one is an adverse price selection from the keeper network of the protocol. So in other words, like providing prices for the execution and closing of trades that are not aligned with the actual underlying price.
00:02:26.990 - 00:02:32.960, Speaker A: And Calador, why does that matter to us? Why is the audience in this room? Should we care about these issues?
00:02:33.490 - 00:03:14.970, Speaker B: So, primary reason would be two main ones. So the first one is, if you're an LP, you don't want someone being able to front run trades and basically put through a risk free trade that comes at the expense of you as an LP if you're acting as a counterparty to the sort of net PNL of traders. So that's one thing. Just lps are then basically getting rugged by traders that are able to submit a trade that is entirely risk free. The second one is if you're a trader, you obviously want the best price execution and you want an exchange that is sort of safe and fair and not sort of privileging one actor over another one in this exchange.
00:03:15.390 - 00:03:52.770, Speaker A: Great, thanks. So as we've been working pretty closely with you guys for a while now on integrating different chainlink infrastructure as part of. Very exciting. What's coming up? Your mvp, right? I mean, at Chainlink, one of the things that we're looking at doing is enabling users such as Osteom to build an exchange that enables fair trading by supplying certain infrastructure that can facilitate that. So maybe you could delve into why that resonates with ostium and maybe what you're incorporating or what you're implementing to enable fair trading on chain.
00:03:52.930 - 00:04:43.762, Speaker B: Sure. I think probably the best way to answer that question is just by starting to discuss the origin story of what we're building and why we wanted to build it in the first place. We originally started trading as sort of consumer retail in the commodities markets and forex markets ourselves, and quickly discovered that most of these traditional markets are not, especially in the commodities and forex side, are not geared towards the average consumer. I could probably go on about this at length, but some of the basics that you would need to know are limits to fractionalization. The contract sizes are extremely large and not geared towards sort of smaller traders, lack of flexibility. Often these platforms are very unintuitive and so forth. And so we really set out to build something that was much more simpler, much more intuitive, and more transparent and fair for on chain users, building basically a better equivalent on chain to anything that currently exists off chain.
00:04:43.762 - 00:05:30.518, Speaker B: And it's really worth noting that these markets specifically are extremely underserved. These are some of the most antiquated and least modernized markets. Certainly in contrast to something like the equities markets. Obviously, in setting out to fulfill that mission, it's important to us that we don't then create a whole host of problems on chain, a new set of problems in trying to solve the ones that we see in the traditional markets. And as Marco laid out earlier, there's a very clear set of issues, I think, that maybe some or many defi users are not even aware know. Most people, I think, go to trade on chain in the hopes that they won't be faced with the sorts of predatory trading issues that they see in centralized exchanges. We wanted to avoid and have that sort of be core to our mission, ensuring that those things don't exist on the decks that we're building.
00:05:30.684 - 00:06:02.906, Speaker C: And I also just wanted to emphasize that it's extremely hard to find on the blockchain right now alternatives to trade this assets that currently live off chain on chain, especially with low latency, that is low enough to provide a really good trading experience for users. And on the other hand, a keeper system that monitors all the trades and ensures the best execution of orders like limit, take profit, and stop losses in a way that is decentralized and cannot be taken advantage of, especially during high volatility periods.
00:06:03.098 - 00:06:40.918, Speaker A: Awesome. Yes. Actually, Marco, just to double click on that, Chainlink's got some exciting announcements that are coming out at Smartcon. We've got an update coming to chainlink automation, which is the decentralized keeper network that's run. We're announcing data streams, which is the low latency oracle, which will be revealed later today. So just maybe you called out two of these main issues you mentioned before. Maybe you could dive a little bit deeper into how each of those issues, both oracle front running and maybe like adverse price selection through toxic flow, are being circumvented by integrating chain and coordination.
00:06:41.014 - 00:07:48.270, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I can start with the data streams that we're using. By using very low latency price feeds with something called commit and reveal mechanism, we ensure that when the trader basically posts an order, the order will be guaranteed execution at that timestamp and not a timestamp in the future as a function of sort of like the lag in the validation process. Right. So I think this is sort of like the biggest zero to one innovation on the data stream side that basically prevents that temporal arbitrage that I talked about. And on the other side, on the keeper network, by having a decentralized keeper network, we basically prevent the protocol from acting maliciously or sort of like the parties interested in running the keepers in situations of high volatility. And we saw this happening, for example, with other oracles during the FTX collapse, right, where many validators took a while to post those closing prices on some exchanges, specifically about Solana prices, so that they could find hedging solutions in the meantime, before they were basically liquidated.
00:07:48.270 - 00:08:35.970, Speaker C: And so this is obviously, like, the problem that I want to emphasize here is that some of those exploits are usually underlooked upon because they only occur in very specific circumstances. So they usually come in two flavors. They either only occur in very high volatility periods that are very hard to forecast. So most people when building the protocol, they sort of slack a little bit on this because they don't see the immediate risk to traders. And on the other hand, they also occur at all times when the systems are poorly designed, but by very small margins, that very slowly sort of erode trader and LPPNL. But they're almost unperceptible. Right, but that over a long course of time and volume, that represents a big burden for protocols.
00:08:36.310 - 00:09:35.534, Speaker A: That's really interesting. So for example, with other Oracle solutions where you might have like an active trading participant actually involved in submitting prices that get reported by the Oracle, what you're saying is that there's a situation where if I also have a position open that should be liquidated, I might be incentivized otherwise to either censor a price report. So basically refrain from participating in a consensus round or maybe submitting a price that might basically cause that liquidation to be missed by a small amount, but maybe a small amount enough that people don't notice. Right. That's super interesting. And then on the automation side, just so I understand, I think it seems like there are two distinct models, right? You have these perb dexes who use like an in house keeper solution where it's basically like whatever I'm using to retrieve a fresh price point to settle a trade on chain. That logic is not actually publicly accessible.
00:09:35.534 - 00:09:51.180, Speaker A: It's kind of like a black box. So if I am submitting traders, potentially ahead of traders on my platform, as I see those trade submissions come in, I can select whatever price I want to settle those trades, and they may not be like none the wiser. Right?
00:09:52.670 - 00:10:18.978, Speaker C: That's true. And I just want to emphasize that this is a big burden for protocols, right. I'm building the tech stack of ostium and carrying this responsibility of running the entire keeper system yourself is really sort of a dramatic responsibility. Right. And it's also a risk and hard to communicate, sort of like that safety to users. Right. If we're not able to use a system that is sort of like fairly decentralized and independent from us, we actually don't want to have the responsibility to do this.
00:10:18.978 - 00:11:05.410, Speaker C: And the decentralized keeper network that Chainlink has built allows us not only to do that, but at the same time we can also simultaneously run our own keeper. So it's not mutually exclusive in a way that we're completely dependent from them, but they're always there. And I just wanted to say another thing, which is in the beginning, keeper economies is complicated. When volume is very low, it's very tough to create incentives from the get go for keeper bots to be worth it. Right. And so you see in many protocols, keeperbots losing a lot of money in the beginning. And so specifically in the early days of the protocol, Chainlink has allowed us since day one to have a system where we have guaranteed execution of all this trade since day one, independent of that sort of like keeper economy incentives.
00:11:06.310 - 00:11:33.318, Speaker A: That's super interesting. So maybe, Kellador, you can touch upon looking at osteom having integrated these solutions and stuff, and looking, I suppose, ahead now, what are kind of the main plans for ossium coming up like in the near future? And then maybe you can touch on what is the end vision ultimately for ossium on chain in continuing to build on this great user experience that both you and Marco have described?
00:11:33.414 - 00:12:00.002, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So we will be announcing our public testnet launch sort of in the very near future, so stay tuned for updates. But it'll be this fall with a sort of main net launch coming up in Q one of next year. So you have that to look forward to. We're very excited to be partnering with Chainlink on that in terms of sort of call to action. We are looking for early testers of the testnet. So we welcome everyone.
00:12:00.002 - 00:12:47.498, Speaker B: But we will definitely are most excited, I think, to speak to traders on the commodity side. So either energy or metals or on the forex side that we think can provide sort of value in assessing the platform and giving detailed feedback. So we'll definitely prioritize early access for any traders that sort of background. So please reach out either on Twitter at osteom Labs, or to myself, Calidora, or Marco, who's contrarian Marco on Twitter. And feel free to give us a shout if you're interested in testing, I guess, briefly on the sort of longer term roadmap. I mentioned this earlier, but really the vision is to build a better alternative on chain to the current options that exist off chain for trading these assets. I think the way we approach this was, I think often we see in Defi or in crypto, generally, people try to build on chain products.
00:12:47.498 - 00:14:00.700, Speaker B: They fall into one of two traps. They either build something that is really, really specific and niche and solves a problem in the beginning. It's a very small tAm, and I don't mean to say anything negative about any of these sorts of products, but maybe a vault for something very specific or any sort of very niche specific product for onchain users, which solves a real problem, has a real use case, which I think often, sometimes can be difficult to actually get to, but ultimately, the tAm is quite small, or people fall into the opposite trap, which often is trying to build something sort of very pie in the sky that's dependent on a lot of sort of external infrastructure or a lot of things happening in the space before the product ultimately becomes useful or has like, a real target audience. So we try to thread the line between those two things, offering an immediate value to onchain users right now, which is basically the ability to diversify in a trader friendly way. When we look at RWAs right now, most of the stuff is geared towards long term holders or towards access to yield coming from off chain markets. There's no really sort of trader friendly solution for trading, for gaining diversification and access to a variety of access. But sort of longer term, the vision is really to build a better alternative for these markets on chain, which we truly think is possible.
00:14:00.700 - 00:14:25.490, Speaker B: Many of these markets suffer in a pretty severe way from lack of transparency, lack of immutability, adverse incentives and so forth. And as both Marco and Halcyon described at length, we think a lot of these problems are solvable on chain. So that's hopefully a little bit of background on why we're building what we're building, and sort of the goal of solving an immediate problem, but also having a much larger sort of ultimate tam and roadmap and vision.
00:14:26.070 - 00:14:54.154, Speaker C: And I would like to add to that that since day one, due to our chain link integrations, we'll have a system, and also due to our synthetic architecture, that you can trade at the actual market price since day one with very tight spreads that are very identical to the spreads that you will find in the real markets. So if you're a liquidity seeker, you'll have that offering since day one with our protocol, thanks to our partnership. So, yeah, very excited for that.
00:14:54.192 - 00:15:36.162, Speaker A: Kellador, Marco, thank you so much for your time. Super excited about the vision you guys have for bringing trading of these assets on chain. I think if people are in agreement that in order to actually boost additional trading volume on chain, and to actually attract volume from people who currently are trading centralized exchanges, it's really necessary to give people the opportunity to trade markets that they're actually used to trading off chain. I think up until what you guys are building today, there hasn't really been that opportunity. So that's very exciting. And, yeah, thank you for spending the time today to talk us through that and I suppose educate everyone in the room on how you guys are avoiding user exploitation using the chain link stack.
00:15:36.226 - 00:15:36.866, Speaker C: Thanks, Alfie.
00:15:36.898 - 00:15:37.780, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. Awesome.
