00:00:02.010 - 00:00:47.222, Speaker A: A financial product is essentially a set of state changes that is triggered either by signatures from private keys or in defi, predominantly by oracles. Right? So oracles are the things triggering and essentially allowing the decentralized financial product to know about the world. And if you make an architecture that makes that decentralized financial product have a skewed view of the world or a view of the world that can get manipulated, you fundamentally, on an architectural level, have just made a serious kind of error. Right. Chainlink fundamentally solves this. From day one, we've been architected to solve it because we're exclusively focused on solving this problem. We're focused on solving the problem of oracle security and the transition of data from off chain environments into on chain environments.
00:00:47.222 - 00:01:46.510, Speaker A: We're also focused on generating some amount of data quality, which is, once again why we source data from hundreds of exchanges, not one, not two, not three. Unfortunately, I think the next version of this exploit is where people go after protocols that use two or three or four exchanges, or one or two exchanges and say, I don't have one exchange, I have two, I have three. All that does is make it a little bit more difficult. It just means that instead of manipulating the price on a single exchange, you now have to do it on two or three. And I think it's a serious concern that both developers of these protocols should look into that. Users of the protocol should evaluate on a level of technical risk and the level of technical risk that they're exposed to through using these protocols. And people making new protocols and launching them really have no reason to have to build their own oracle, just like they have no reason to roll their own crypto or make their own private key security devices.
00:01:46.510 - 00:02:07.090, Speaker A: There are now systems that properly transition data into on chain environments. And in Chainlink's case, we disperse the sources of that data so widely and in such a decentralized way that for crypto prices, we get that data from hundreds of different exchanges, such that we provide you market cover, region of global price. Bye.
