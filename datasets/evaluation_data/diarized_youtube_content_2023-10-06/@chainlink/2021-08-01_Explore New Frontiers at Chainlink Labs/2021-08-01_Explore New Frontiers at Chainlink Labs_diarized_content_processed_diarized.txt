00:00:00.650 - 00:00:35.540, Speaker A: We are building a new world. It's a new kind of paradigm. It's a completely new world, right? And just like Ethereum is providing you some tools with smart contracts and all of this beautiful stuff, we're providing you some tools to access the real world. So come and see and explore, because the frontiers have not been set yet. The frontiers keep moving, and what wasn't possible yesterday day will be possible tomorrow. And whoever is listening to this podcast might be the one who makes us tomorrow happen, right? So, yeah, I really encourage people to look into it.
