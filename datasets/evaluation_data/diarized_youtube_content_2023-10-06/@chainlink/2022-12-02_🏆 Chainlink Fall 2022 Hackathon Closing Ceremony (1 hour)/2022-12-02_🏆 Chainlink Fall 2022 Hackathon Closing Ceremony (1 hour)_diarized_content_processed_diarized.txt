00:01:01.620 - 00:01:16.500, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. Welcome GM. GM. Hopefully everyone is doing fantastic today and it's that time of the year. A Chainlink hackathon has come to a close. And we are all very excited.
00:01:16.500 - 00:01:47.696, Speaker A: We're all very excited. We worked very hard. We coded a lot, we learned a lot, and we just went through over a month of coding, of building, of doing really cool stuff, networking, meeting all these people, and now we're at the end. We're at the end of this journey. But just because this journey ends, that doesn't mean the crypto journey has ended. It has really just begun for a lot of you. And I know I've said this time and time again, we are so happy that you joined us for this hackathon and we hope you learned a lot.
00:01:47.696 - 00:02:07.180, Speaker A: So GM, everybody. Good to see everybody in the chat. Hopefully everyone is doing well. We have a fantastic closing ceremony for everybody here. So without further ado, let's just jump right into it. And I know it's scheduled for, I think an hour. Yes, I believe an hour.
00:02:07.180 - 00:02:27.436, Speaker A: We might be a little quicker than that, but let's get into it. So, presentation mode. All right. Chain link hackathon closing ceremony here. Another hackathon. The fall 2022 chain link hackathon has come to a close. Your projects have been submitted.
00:02:27.436 - 00:02:47.096, Speaker A: The judges have judged the projects. You've learned something. You've committed. You committed to building something. And with that, I want to give a huge thank you to everybody who's here. Absolute Massive thank you, everyone who participated, everyone who built, everyone who didn't build and was just encouraging people along the way. Huge thank you for being here.
00:02:47.096 - 00:03:26.564, Speaker A: These hackathons really only make sense because you come right, we put these on for you, for the developers here. And we're so thankful that people keep coming back year after year and hackathon after hackathon to keep participating and keep building. Obviously, major thank you to the judges and sponsors and the group behind the project that helped put this together. Huge thank you to the sponsors, the major sponsors for this hackathon. And a massive thank you to Melody. Melody heads up the hackathon project here. So everything that happens behind the scenes, thank you, Melody, for all your hard work.
00:03:26.564 - 00:03:50.376, Speaker A: And speaking of thank yous, we did it again. This was another record breaker. I don't know how every single chain link hackathon keeps getting bigger than the last one. Last one we had about 310 ish amazing projects this hackathon. We had 340. Every single time more people show up, more people build. And I'm always like, how do we keep getting bigger.
00:03:50.376 - 00:04:14.276, Speaker A: How does this hackathon keep growing? This has been the largest chain link hackathon that has ever existed. Over 10,000 developers, around 340 amazing projects. Oh, yes. And somebody in the chat just said, and super thanks to Agnes as well. Absolutely. She helped a lot of the team formations and a lot of the behind the scenes as well, as well as Melissa and a lot of the developer marketing team over here at Chainlink Labs. So huge thank you.
00:04:14.276 - 00:04:36.236, Speaker A: Just to a ton of people, the list goes on and on. But yes, good point. Thank you for calling that out. But yeah, another record breaker. So thank you all for making this another record breaker. Like we said at the beginning, countless others use this hackathon as their Kickstarter to their web3 careers. And those of you who submitted, you made the commitment to submit, and I want to applaud you.
00:04:36.236 - 00:05:04.420, Speaker A: I watched all of your videos, which was a lot of videos. It was a lot of projects, but in a ton of them, I saw some people go, hey, I'm really only submitting because Patrick told me to. Good. That is exactly the mentality you should have, because I know that you saying, hey, I'm going to submit something. It forced you to put that deadline on yourself to say, I'm going to learn something no matter what. So huge shout out to you. Huge thank you to you.
00:05:04.420 - 00:05:34.670, Speaker A: Massive thank you to you. And with that being said, we can talk some prizes. So let's do that, shall we? Let's talk some prizes. So there is around half a million dollars in prizes. And I know a lot of the time when we do these, we don't always have the sponsors projects picked yet to announce. We do this time, which is very exciting. And of course, if you win a prize, please wait at least two months for prizes to be distributed before reaching out.
00:05:34.670 - 00:06:00.416, Speaker A: They have to go through a lot of legal loopholes for sending money to addresses. So please be patient. We will send them. But, yeah, if you don't hear anything for two months, definitely reach out. And we're going to first start with the chainlink. Top quality prizes. These are the projects that we took a look at, we judged, and we said, you know what, these are all really good projects.
00:06:00.416 - 00:06:34.828, Speaker A: That's kind of really all we have to say. Projects that really kind of stood out, that seem to be top quality projects. We unfortunately aren't going to have time to go through every single one of them. So we're just going to put the names on the screen and if you see your name there, you'll know, oh, I won a project, I won a prize. And this is where you take a screenshot of it, post it on Twitter. You go, oh my God, I won chain link top quality prize and it's very exciting. So chain link top quality prizes are this massive list of 40 projects.
00:06:34.828 - 00:07:37.316, Speaker A: So if you see yourself on here, congratulations, you've won one of the top quality prize awards. These will be announced on dev post after this as well. Yeah, here's the list here tweet win keep erc 20 job Explorer synergy chain link data marketplace, great pump, Nicoverse, Dr. Coordinator, SyS Fuss Protocol, Hackman, wcnft Fantasy, IPPs, Chain link price view and integrations of SAP dbetting promise, nodeless selling flex nodes, real block DnD diffusion pist score I know they pronounced their projects in the videos, but I went through almost 400 so I forgot the name. How to pronounce some of these liquidity wars, Battle of heroes, umpire caravan, random as the service, hyper tally block fright, get me pizza.edu. Net, Medicare, FOMO casino, community, Fanzone, PDC finance, Pando social defi, chainfi, Nifty matic order, pool decks, random clash, and any data requester. So if you're on this list, a huge congratulations to you.
00:07:37.316 - 00:08:07.468, Speaker A: And if you're not on this list, you might have won another prize. Or again, the prizes are kind of just a nice little thing here to have. The big thing here is about learning. It's about growing, it's about networking. So if you're not here and you learned, you grew, you committed, you submitted, you should be proud of yourself regardless. But that's the chainlink top quality projects list there. We're going to save some of the Chainlink grand prizes, Defi prize, social prize, et cetera, for later on in the hackathon.
00:08:07.468 - 00:08:53.052, Speaker A: For now, we're going to start with some sponsor prizes, which is very exciting that we have sponsor prizes. We had of course, IPFs, Polygon, Trueflation, and Solana as some of the major sponsors for this hackathon. And I got to tell you, I was very impressed with pretty much all the products here. I'm a big fan of decentralized data, of different blockchains, of working with RPC URLs, and from my perspective, I was man like. If I had to judge for the sponsor prizes, that would have been tough too, because all the projects were so cool and there's just so much that you can do. So absolutely love seeing all the projects from the sponsor side. So with Filecoin, they had a number of prizes.
00:08:53.052 - 00:09:46.080, Speaker A: Their first category was storage wizard and the prizes here were amino chain, scrappy IPFs, Filecoin and zk trace. So huge congratulations to those three projects for winning the storage wizard award from Filecoin. Then was the web3 Phi which went to podship and getme pizza. We had the social good warrior prizes which went to world three in chemotronics on the tools, scrappy IPs, Filecoin again and flex nodes gaming MB, Dow and NFT went to Oasis Labs and Pixeland. And yes, the prize breakdowns will be available on Devpost. They probably are already compute over data, Hypertali, wiki IPFs and simula. And then they had a series of pool prizes as well.
00:09:46.080 - 00:10:24.140, Speaker A: Rughault gaming go bug buzzer, Chameleon IPFSML, contractful decentralized hiring, ETH medicine, proto sound, dbook, dlink and lay vocab. Huge congratulations to everybody on these lists as well, and for winning a prize with the Filecoin sponsor here. And again, thank you so much Filecoin for sponsoring this hackathon. This was an absolute massive hackathon and we had an absolute blast. So awesome work. Filecoin moving over to polygon polygon. The top three prizes went to nodelist, Link, Hypertali, and Batman Nana Nana.
00:10:24.140 - 00:10:57.152, Speaker A: I think that's the joke there. Huge congratulations to those three projects for the Polygon sponsor awards. Polygon had some additional categories as well. They had best use of the polygon id which went to decentralized comti I pronouncing that wrong. But they also had best UX and DX application which went to web3 stash. So huge congratulations there to those projects. Polygon also had some pool prizes, so if you're on this list, you get to participate in the polygon pool prizes.
00:10:57.152 - 00:11:48.090, Speaker A: Chain link technical indicators zk two of a amino chain expire three link wallet, community fan zone, Fobwelt Studios, sissy protocol, umpire and ETH road ops oh, also food delivery, metaverse game, DNA banana, pay doctrine, immunomic seven ball patient and Ipps. Huge congratulations. Sorry, I'm kind of going a little quick here. Huge congratulations to everybody winning these polygon prizes. Like we said via email, the sponsors will reach out, let you know about your prize winnings, where to collect, and huge congratulations there again. And thank you Polygon. Absolute Massive thank you to Polygon for helping sponsor this hackathon and giving out prizes to all you phenomenal projects here.
00:11:48.090 - 00:12:18.764, Speaker A: Next we had Solana Solana. First place, dual finance. So congratulations to dual finance for Solana here and huge thank you to Solana for helping sponsor this hackathon, helping put in this on. There's a lot of Chainlink Solana content and there's a lot of Chainlink Solana code bases that people have used to build really cool stuff like dual finance. So huge thank you to Solana. Congratulations to dual finance. Quicknote.
00:12:18.764 - 00:12:51.876, Speaker A: Congratulations to promise team behind promise. And thank you so much to quicknote for sponsoring this hackathon and giving out the prize to promise, trueflation, fortunity, synergy, and real block. One, two, three. Absolutely crushed it. Really cool projects here. So congratulations to the three of you, and a huge thank you to trueflation for sponsoring this hackathon as well. All right, with all the sponsor prizes being said, let's go into the chain link prizes.
00:12:51.876 - 00:13:16.980, Speaker A: And you can see I'm flying by here, right? I'm getting a lot quicker at these closing ceremony things. I'm like, all right, let's announce, tell people they got their prize, and let's keep going. So Chainlink prizes here. These are the projects that the Chainlink labs teams and all the judges in general said. These are something special. There's something special about these prizes. There's something special about these projects.
00:13:16.980 - 00:14:04.716, Speaker A: And there were a list of different categories, a list of different tiers for each one of them. And we're going to go through. That was the wrong way. First place for the chainlink NFT and gaming prize went to mine labor simulator, which was a browser based NFT game. This was a really cool game that watching the demo, going through the code, everything just kind of seemed to work, which was really cool to see. Really a game that you can play in the browser and you can collect things, you can run around, do things and work with, get NFTs through your metamask or your wallet that's connected to your browser and, yeah, really cool project. Maybe it's the future of decentralized gaming.
00:14:04.716 - 00:14:36.670, Speaker A: So huge congratulations to mine, labor simulator, and your NFT and gaming prize. Yes, I should have done a real drum roll. Yes, I should do a real drum roll for these. Let me get the drumroll. Audio. Yeah, maybe I'll do the drum roll myself. All right, next on the list we have.
00:14:36.670 - 00:15:18.376, Speaker A: Where did my stuff go? All right, next on the list we have Defi. Defi went to fuse, which is a lending protocol backed by proof of reserve, as we've seen this year. And huge congratulations to fuse. As we've seen this year, proof of reserves is becoming ever more pressingly important. Where protocols and companies can prove how much they have in reserves, they can prove how much collateral they have. And fused did this and made a lending protocol based off. It was really cool.
00:15:18.376 - 00:16:05.016, Speaker A: So huge congratulations to fused for winning the d five prize at the Chainlink fall 2022 hackathon. Congratulations. So next on the list, Chainlink Services prize. This was the prize that went to the projects that helped chain link developers improve their lives in some way, or it was something that could become a service that you go to the Chainlink docs and you go, oh, there's this new thing that you can integrate for developers. So this was kind of either one of those. And there were three spots there link for prizes for this. And the three spots went to link wallet, linkit and KN three.
00:16:05.016 - 00:16:25.916, Speaker A: Job management. Link wallet was like a way to abstract payments with a wallet through a chain link network link. It was a job spec visualizer, which was really cool. And Knn three did job management. I guess the t got cut off. Sorry. Job management, which helped manage your jobs in your chain link node.
00:16:25.916 - 00:17:16.324, Speaker A: So all these would improve the lives of Chainlink developers in some way. So hopefully they continue these projects. And at the next hackathon, maybe you can use one of these to help your project do something really cool. So huge congratulations to these services. Thank you so much for participating and wanting to improve the lives of us. Devs, right? Huge thank you there, moving right along the Chainlink Dow prize to the project that best incorporated a Dow. This went to cryptodo Dao, which was a no code Dow launcher, which I really liked because there are a lot of no code Dow launchers, but a lot of them use a lot of centralized levers and switches to make the process easier because the architecture required to build a fully decentralized no code Dow launcher is tricky.
00:17:16.324 - 00:17:50.248, Speaker A: They went in, they built a no code Dow launcher with a lot of decentralized levers and pulleys, and that's what we love to see. So really impressive tool here. Huge congratulations to them for winning the Dow prize. Then we have the social impact prize, the prize that, the project that built some project that was going to help the world in a meaningful way. And this went to cyclimate, which was a carbon footprint and healthy lifestyle application. It helps track your carbon emissions while also promoting you to bike around. Hence the name cyclimate and exercise in general.
00:17:50.248 - 00:18:23.332, Speaker A: So huge congratulations to cyclimate. Thank you so much for being a part of this hackathon. And then the Chainlink woman in Tech prize, which went to Oraviz. We couldn't decide on where to put this. We almost gave this person a services prize as well. But we ended up giving them the woman in tech prize for their chainlink node debugger, which was, again, just a really helpful tool. As a lot of people here know, sometimes debugging your jobs and, oh, did my job go through.
00:18:23.332 - 00:18:48.750, Speaker A: What happened can be a little bit tricky. So, huge congratulations to this project. Well done. And now the moment a lot of you have been waiting for. Let me flip back. A lot of people are telling me, why aren't you on camera? I'm not on camera because I messed up my obs settings and I don't have a setup where I can be in the screen while also. Never mind.
00:18:48.750 - 00:19:08.736, Speaker A: But we're going to do the grand prize. And for this, let's actually get a drumroll here. Let's actually get a drumroll. So I am on camera. I don't need a stunt double. Yes, I have been reading the chat as I've been giving this presentation here, but let's do a drum roll. Drum roll.
00:19:08.736 - 00:19:27.770, Speaker A: Because like I said earlier, these hackathons aren't really about the prizes anyways. They're about learning. They're about growing. But it is kind of cool when you get to say, hey, I won the grand prize. I won the chain link hackathon grand prize. So let's get a drum roll. Hopefully you all can hear this.
00:19:27.770 - 00:20:43.484, Speaker A: And the chain link grand prize winner, fall 2022 is huge. Congratulations to Shiro storage. For their decentralized storage and smart contract connection framework. This was a tool we thought was absolutely killer because what we see right now with most Dapps is most DApps have all their data stored on the smart contract and on whatever layer one that they're using, but they could be expanded even more with a decentralized database. Now, the reason most projects don't have a decentralized database is because, as you know, connecting to real world data is very difficult. But, aha. What's Chainlink good at? Chainlink's good at connecting blockchains to real world data, so they built a tool that helps people build and connect smart contracts to decentralized storage, which seemed just incredibly, incredibly powerful.
00:20:43.484 - 00:21:25.608, Speaker A: So we're hoping to see this project continue hoping to see people be able to build decentralized solutions using a decentralized database. Because as we know, all modern Dapps today have a database. All modern applications today have a database. So why don't decentralized applications have a database, too? So ensure storage uses the chainlink network to help build that and help create that connection. So huge congratulations to them. And obviously huge congratulations to everybody else who participated as well. So as we know, as I've said already, if you want one of the prizes, please be patient.
00:21:25.608 - 00:22:04.796, Speaker A: We will be reaching out within the next two months to distribute prizes, hopefully quicker. But sometimes, like I said, it can take a little bit. But I want to just give another huge thank you. I know we flew by, we flew through this because there's so many amazing projects that we want to be able to promote and help. And I know you all did that during the hackathon, which is fantastic. So another chain link hackathon has come to a close. Fall 2022 chain link hackathon is over.
00:22:04.796 - 00:22:27.296, Speaker A: But I want everyone who showed up to these hackathons who built something cool or who didn't build something cool, who networked or whatever, take this as a step. Hey, I've learned something. I'm going to go forth now and iterate. I'm going to do more. I'm going to learn more. I'm going to build on the project that I built on. I'm going to try to unblock myself on that thing I couldn't figure out.
00:22:27.296 - 00:23:02.670, Speaker A: These hackathons are the stomping grounds of innovations. They are not the end goal. They are not the end result. The end result is to go out, build really cool things that help the world, do stuff, create value. So if you feel like you learned a lot and you want to create some value, keep going, keep building, keep growing. We're so excited that you were a part of us. You were with us for this hackathon, that you participated, that you submitted your projects, and with that, we'll bring this to a close.
00:23:02.670 - 00:23:08.190, Speaker A: Huge congratulations to everybody and hope to see you in the next one.
