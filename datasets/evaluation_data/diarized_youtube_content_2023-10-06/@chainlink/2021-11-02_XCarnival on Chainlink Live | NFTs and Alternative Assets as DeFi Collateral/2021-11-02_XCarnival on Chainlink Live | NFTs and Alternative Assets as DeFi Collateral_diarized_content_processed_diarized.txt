00:00:00.330 - 00:00:19.120, Speaker A: Because we're just like, you know, I have the trim ability and all that stuff. So we're talking a little bit about where we're from and everything. How did you, how did you get into crypto? I'm just curious, like, because you're like a media personality. What brought you over? What excites you about this? Why are you here?
00:00:20.050 - 00:00:57.322, Speaker B: Well, you know, I've been always in working in innovation. So I've been living between Silicon Valley and China before the COVID when we could still travel freely. And so I cover innovation and business. And so crypto was part of the innovation story, right. I stumbled into crypto in 2018, the previous bull market when everybody was talking about it. Remember how crazy it was? And consensus summit in New York. There was this crypto media called Mass Finance.
00:00:57.322 - 00:01:22.886, Speaker B: It's the equivalent of corn desk for China. So they wanted to have an global exposure in the US, so they approached me. So that's how I entered the crypto space, through media first, and then it fascinated me, the speed and then the innovation, the craziness. So I've been in crypto ever since.
00:01:23.068 - 00:01:42.186, Speaker A: Awesome. I'm just curious just always to hear how people's journeys get them here and everything. Hey, everybody. Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyne from Chainlink Labs. I'm talking to Vivi from X Carnival. We're going to learn all about X Carnival today, what they do, why they do it, how they do it, and their goals for the future, kind of how they're positioned.
00:01:42.186 - 00:02:15.400, Speaker A: So let's get started on this episode of Chainlink Live. Vivi, it's great to have you here again, everyone. My name is Andy Boyen. We're doing this episode of Chainlink Live, pre recorded, so you can ask your questions in telegrams later. I'll send you to X Carnival's telegram to ask more questions later. But for this one, I'm going to just take the lead and ask the questions here. Phoebe, why don't you get us started? Tell us a little bit about yourself and just who you are, and then who is X Carnival and what makes X Carnival special?
00:02:16.010 - 00:02:47.570, Speaker B: Sure. Hi, Andy. Thank you for having me. And hi, everybody. I'm happy to see your questions in the telegram later. So I'm a contributor for X Carnival Advocates in crypto innovation. I've been living and traveling between Silicon Valley and China as a tv journalist like before the COVID Now I'm currently based in Shanghai and couldn't really travel freely as before, as everybody could imagine.
00:02:47.570 - 00:03:27.742, Speaker B: But I also covered a quorum. I write a quorum on innovation and crypto for the Financial Times China. So now an overview on X Carnival is a lending aggregator for metaverse assets. Now, in other words, it offers lending and pledging services for NFT and long tail crypto assets. Think about it as a kind of a new type of bank. Now everybody's talking about metaverse nowadays, right? Facebook just announced that they renamed themselves. And so we really think that we would like to be part of the infrastructure to empower and add liquidity to the space.
00:03:27.742 - 00:04:04.150, Speaker B: Now, the Xkannwell platform was launched on finance smart chain on October 18, which is last week with two core products, X broker and Megabox. I'll tell you more a little bit later on. So it's also a multi chain project. The X Carnival team will also deploy the platform to other protocols, including Ethereum and also other L2 like Polygon and Solana. We take some time here, let me walk you through how it works. Yes, please. Imagine if you have an NFT.
00:04:04.150 - 00:05:08.282, Speaker B: I'm sure a lot of you have an NFT nowadays, but if you need liquidity and you don't want to sell your nfts, right, you like your NFT, what can you do? You could pledge your NFT and get a loan from X broker at X Carnival. So once you have the money and feel like having your NFT back, and you could pay back the loans with an interest you agreed on and get it back. So as simple as that. But of course, prices are decided peer to peer by the lender and borrower. So of course there are scenarios that you might not have the money back. Then what happened? Let me take you further. Just like the porn shop in real life, remember, if you need money and sometimes you put an old watch so you can get a loan, you put in your grandma's ring or something, right? So X Carnival has this unique liquidation or clearing mechanism.
00:05:08.282 - 00:06:20.120, Speaker B: So once the borrower fails to pay back the money, so the assets, nfts in this case will go into the system of like an auction, so that people in a market could auction for the piece of assets. So once the money goes in the system, so it will clear the debt and pay back the money. So basically the borrower will lose the. So in the worst case, if nobody wants, for example, if no one in the market wants that NFT, so the lender will get to keep the NFT. So really how a mortgage works in real, you're, you're asking what makes the platform special, right? So also let me point out, there's several points of innovation here. Now first of all, it's the product that the NFT market really needs, because we know that liquidity is a big issue for the secondary NFT markets. And sometimes you just sit on the assets, no matter how high the floor prices are.
00:06:20.120 - 00:07:19.754, Speaker B: And sometimes you don't want to sell, you still want to be able to keep it, but you do need the money. So a lot of incubant platforms right now still do not accept nfts as collateral due to its poor liquidity or the risks because the prices are very volatile. So X carnival is really tackling this industry pain point with a peer to peer and also type limit auction style, which is quite an innovation here. And another tricky part is the pricing of nfts. It's super subjective and there's so many variables in this equation. And also when aesthetics plays a part, it's almost impossible to come up with a metrics like fungible tokens. So that's why X Carnival has a smart way to solve this problem, giving the powers back to the market.
00:07:19.754 - 00:08:14.646, Speaker B: So through peer to peer mechanism, borrowers and lenders decide the prices among them, and the platform simply works as a marketplace to make sure everything functions through smart contracts. And also, what is more, the business model is very interesting. The X Carnival platform allows users to develop the habit of NFT pledging and lending through its mining mechanism. So we heard about play to earn. You play the game and you earn. And in this scenario it's like land to earn, so you pledge and then if someone lends you, so if you have this whole process of borrowing and lending, and as long as you participate in this whole process, your activities count as mining. So you get rewards, the XCV token, through this whole activity.
00:08:14.646 - 00:08:45.970, Speaker B: So I think it's kind of one of the first in the industry to come up with such a concept, borrow a land to earn. So quite special out there. So also there are many layers and very micro innovation in the product and also in the process that I'm not going to every detail here, but since the platform is live now, so if the audience you're listening or you're watching out there, if you're interested or end yourself, you could navigate the product wild the depth.
00:08:48.790 - 00:09:31.874, Speaker A: We'll have the links down below in the description so people can do that as they wish. Open it at a new tab, don't leave, hang out with us, we're still going perfect. There's some elements of this that remind me of things that exist in defi maker auctions, their liquidations and those are typically collateralized with ETH, but they do eth auctions. And so you can kind of buy this ETH at a price, and then there's a market competition for that. What's really interesting is adding this aesthetic, the NFT, to it is by providing a peer to peer marketplace, you're letting people kind of determine what they're willing to pay for these and then let the market decide. I think that's pretty interesting. And then there is also a recent price feed that chainlink is doing.
00:09:31.874 - 00:10:16.234, Speaker A: A data feed, I should say, for punk floor prices, crypto punk floor prices and pricing nfts is really hard. And the reason you can do it with punks is because there's an established floor, it's well known, there's a number of marketplaces and sort of data points on that, but it's really hard to do with less liquid or less well known, less, fewer markets that are around to get a good price on nfts. There's so many projects that are new that's part of this industry. So that volatility is there and there's subjectivity there, and it's really hard to do. And even with punks, you can get a floor price, but that doesn't mean that's the price. If it has different rare features or something like that. There's these different elements that are up to individuals.
00:10:16.234 - 00:10:37.986, Speaker A: Maybe something's more meaningful to one person than another or whatever it happens to be. There's a lot of complication in that. And a peer to peer marketplace solves a lot of that by letting people determine for themselves, like you do the research and decide what it is that you want. You are using Chainlink. Carnival is using Chainlink. Can you talk a little bit about how you're using Chainlink in this protocol?
00:10:38.178 - 00:11:00.558, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think, Andy, you make a really great point. Up like pungs is a great example. And then also not only x carnival. Right? So a lot of players in different protocols are trying to tackle this issue. And definitely it's a challenge and everyone is figuring out because it's something really new. So that is part of the innovation process.
00:11:00.558 - 00:11:49.546, Speaker B: And so talking about price feed and asset security is really one of our top priorities. And the main purpose of our product is really to provide liquidity to the NFT space, to the network space with Defi. So the price fee is the key. Now, without the reliable external financial market data that Oracle provides, you can't really build Defi. So Chainlink is really one of the most reliable, decentralized oracle networks that provides real world data to smart contracts on the blockchain, as we know. So we already know that billions of dollars of Defi projects like RV, compound, DydX, all secure by Chainlink. So as carnival.
00:11:49.546 - 00:12:55.966, Speaker B: That's why we think that the integration with Chainlink is so important because it really further drive trust and transparency to our product. We heard stories that we know that a good oracle can really function as autonomers auditors monitoring for fraudulent activity in real time. And we heard so many stories on projects that lost millions of dollars because they use unaudited, centralized oracles that were compromised, sudden shifts in market liquidity. And that happens a lot, right? The prices of volatility is crazy. Or flesh loans exploits. So in some of the vicious attacks, bad loans, bad actors really could manipulate the prices of tokens via flesh loans and that could really enable them to buy tokens at a vastly reduced rate. So we don't want that happening to our users on our platforms.
00:12:55.966 - 00:13:24.720, Speaker B: So that's why we chose chain link, decentralized, reliable oracle sources. And we could have just used those amm at pancake or other oracle resources. But we think that this is really important that to have a world standard like one of the best oracle in the market right now, that I think Chainlink is really the best for us.
00:13:25.730 - 00:14:05.020, Speaker A: If you're putting up collateral to take out a loan, that collateral has a value, and that value matters because if that value suddenly drops, then you're likely, or there's the possibility of getting liquidated, of losing your collateral. And that's what typically a lender or a borrower does not want. You don't want to lose your collateral. And in a volatile market, there's always a chance of that. But at the bare minimum, if you're going to get liquidated, you want it to be because of an accurate price, not because of a manipulated price. If you're putting up eth, for example, and the price feed that is used is incorrect, and eth drops on the price feed you use, and that's not fair, that's wrong.
00:14:05.550 - 00:14:06.058, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:14:06.144 - 00:14:37.400, Speaker A: To combat that, Chainlink sources hundreds of marketplaces, dozens of node operators that aggregate all these price feeds together and provide a clear data. When I was preparing for this, I'm learning a little bit about Xcarnival and the integration. We do an NFT series and we do a defi series. And this fit in both because it really is an innovation for NFTs, but fundamentally, it's a DeFi protocol, it's a lending protocol. And so the price feeds, it fit in there. So it's both DeFi and NFTs, but you're in the defi section, it doesn't really matter.
00:14:39.770 - 00:14:43.030, Speaker B: It's a project that where NFT meets DeFi.
00:14:44.730 - 00:15:01.674, Speaker A: One of the things I noticed know, because you're using nfts as collateral or people are able to use nfts as collateral, but then another one of the taglines I've seen on your website and such is that everything is collateral. I think that's a really interesting perspective. I think it's worth digging into. What do you mean by that? Everything is collateral?
00:15:01.802 - 00:15:30.200, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. Yeah. Before we go into that, everything is collateral, but also we want to also give a little bit of a warning to the users out there. Everything's collateral, but really be aware of the risks out there. I'm glad you brought this up. This really has a lot to do with our vision and mission. We believe that the age of Metaverse is coming.
00:15:30.200 - 00:16:33.610, Speaker B: It's a buzword in the news and it's really happening, especially with the advent of nfts that really make property rights in the digital world possible. So we really think that this is a revolution. It's going to disrupt a lot of business and the way we operate and everything. So like you correctly pointed out, everything's collateral. So under this backdrop, X Carnival's mission is really to become one of the indispensable infrastructures for the metaverse and working towards unlocking more liquidity for the space through innovation. So we really think that with our platform, we're able to help people to make the best use of their assets being nfts or alcoins. Also, we have the second product, megabox, that deals with alcoin liquidity as well.
00:16:33.610 - 00:17:05.060, Speaker B: Sometimes we have hundreds of thousands of projects coming up every month. Their tokens are the alcoins, right? And also the same way that the NFTs, like a lot of platforms, the incubant players are not accepting them as collaterals due to the high risks and volatility. So we are also tackling this issue and helping users or owners of the alcoins with their liquidity issues.
00:17:05.670 - 00:17:59.074, Speaker A: There's this phrase, I think Mark Anderson said it, it's attributed to him, I think is software is eating the world. And that means that the world is more and more turning digital and all smart contracts and nfts, and all of this is about giving those digital things verified ownership and verified value and discrete entities in digitization, which enables us to assign them a value. That's how this whole process works going from the analog to the digital. Well, that digital has its analog because it is proven through digital smart contract technology, which gives things value so that they can be used as collateral. Now, as you correctly pointed out, just because it is collateral doesn't mean it doesn't come without risk. In fact, it does come with risk, necessarily, if you put it up as collateral. It's part of the definition.
00:17:59.074 - 00:18:05.960, Speaker A: So how does Xcarnival determine the risk associated with pieces of collateral? What goes into that thinking?
00:18:06.330 - 00:18:57.160, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a great question. We have a smartly designed mechanism in place to prevent, first of all, systematic risks on our end. So we have the two core products, right? X broker that deals with NFT liquidity and megabox that deals with alcoin liquidity. So each product works slightly different in terms of risk management for X broker. So since it's a peer to peer kind of mechanism, the risk is basically contained within each transaction. So like mentioned earlier, if the borrower fails to pay back the loan, their NFT as collateral will enter the clearing process. So the system will make sure that the lender will get back the money or receive that collateral in return.
00:18:57.160 - 00:19:52.362, Speaker B: We're giving our users or community members, we are telling them as well, exactly the risks as borrower or lender, which is you might lose your nfts if you can't pay back the loan as a borrower. Right. And then as a lender, you are facing the risks that you might end up buying the nfts, because if the borrower couldn't pay back money. So never lend the money more than you wanted for that piece of NFT. So beware of the risk and don't lend more money or don't borrow more money than you can afford. So I think we will really contain the risk among themselves for x broker. And also now for megabox, the second product for lcoins, it's a different story.
00:19:52.362 - 00:20:21.714, Speaker B: So we have the metrics that really take into account the prices, volume and circulation of each alcoin. Now we have four alcoins, and we are like baby steps, step by step. So we are exploring still, this is a really new territory. And we come up with the collateral ratio that could accommodate market movement. And we also have different ceilings of different alcoins. So when it comes to borrowing. So all the alcoins are functioning in separate pools, if you think about it.
00:20:21.714 - 00:20:53.020, Speaker B: So that it means that even if one alcoin has bad debt issue or default in the worst case, right, it won't impact the whole pool. So it won't collapse so that we could prevent the systematic risks. And also we're monitoring and we have these metrics to put in place to really make sure that the whole system functions. So we take risk management very seriously in this regard.
00:20:54.030 - 00:21:34.394, Speaker A: It's been really great learning about this whole vision of everything is collateral. And how do you deal with nfts on this peer to peer marketplace as well as these other altcoins price feeds? Of course, that's where Chainlink price feeds fit in as well. And you guys just launched, I mean, this is a newly launched product. Congratulations on that. By the time this airs, it'll be a couple of weeks ago. So I hate to ask people this when they just launch, but what's next? I know a launch is a big deal, but kind of looking forward, talk a little bit about how does Xcarnival see itself as a platform in the future? What are some of those high level goals? And then also what are some of those discrete steps we can see in the next couple of months?
00:21:34.592 - 00:22:28.842, Speaker B: Yeah, that's brilliant. I know that in the crypto space everything moves so fast. We just launched last week. We feel like we're already up and running and everything is just like to the moon and go, go. So our goal has always been continuing to improve our products and to offer a better kind of user experience and educating the market because it's something so new and growing more consensus from our community so that we can really, truly empower the know. Let's take a little step back to look know what we come know. We really come a long way since a couple months ago we won the championship for the BSC Singapore hackathon earlier this year.
00:22:28.842 - 00:23:16.726, Speaker B: And we developed two core modules, XBroker and Megabox, as mentioned. And also we passed a security audits by certic on all our products and smart contracts. So we also upgraded the products and everything. So every time we did a change, we audited it. So we, the products works well and we grow our consensus. So we just launched and then finished our ino initial NFT offering with two rounds of our genesis NFT mysterious box. So, so that people can use our NFT as kind of like an MVP to do the pledging and lending.
00:23:16.726 - 00:24:21.438, Speaker B: So this is like a first step. So the users right now, they could navigate the platform with the Genesis nfts and also could try the mining process, lend or borrow to mine. So really kicking off the whole new business model. So the next step we will work with definitely more ecosystem partners and we're talking to other big players. First of all in the binance smart chain ecosystem like pancake and baby swap so that we could include their nfts. So use owners of their nfts could do pledging and lending in our platforms and then also treasure land, doodoo and Gamefi project. So we are expanding the list of NFT projects to work together so that we could really add liquidity and empower the space by working together with them.
00:24:21.438 - 00:25:00.750, Speaker B: And also like we are a multi chain project as well. So the team is also working on deploying on Ethereum and also other L2 protocols. So really there's a lot to do and also talking about listing the token and we want to focus on building the product and really just do the work, keep building and empowering the ecosystem at the right time. We want to list in centralized exchange so to gain more consensus. And that's all in the cards.
00:25:01.890 - 00:25:28.760, Speaker A: One of the things that as I was researching X carnival, your community is massive. There's like a ton of people in your telegram and it's just hello everyone, welcome to chainlink YouTube. Like and subscribe. For those of you who are coming from X Carnival to watch, talk a little bit about who is this community? It's a fantastic community. Who are they and where can people join and join this movement and be part of this community?
00:25:29.610 - 00:26:38.042, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm so glad that you noticed and really we feel very grateful that we grown to become, we get to grow with all these people. So as we speak, we have about 100,000 people in our global telegram groups and we also have over 10,000 people in other languages like the Chinese and Indonesians and other language groups. So I think we build our consensus step by step. And then obviously we believe that people who follow us and who joined us also believe in our vision that they do see the need. And then we are really filling the market gap here, doing something that really makes sense. And so for anyone who's interested to join our community, and we have the information out there.
