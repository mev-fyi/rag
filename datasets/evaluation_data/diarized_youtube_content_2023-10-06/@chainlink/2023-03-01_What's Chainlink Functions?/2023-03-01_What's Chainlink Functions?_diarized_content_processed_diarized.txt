00:00:00.250 - 00:00:27.026, Speaker A: I have some exciting news. We've launched a new product, Chainlink functions. It'll allow you to access off chain compute and your smart contracts. Chainlink functions provides your smart contract with access to trust minimized compute infrastructure. It enables you to send code to a distributed Oracle network, or dawn. Each oracle will run code in its own serverless environment. Once the oracles have their results, the dawn aggregates them and returns that result back on chain to your smart contract.
00:00:27.026 - 00:00:38.180, Speaker A: Your code could be anything from a complex computation saving you gas on chain to an API call. Now, it's important to note this is currently a beta. There'll be a link in the description for access. I can't wait to see what you build.
