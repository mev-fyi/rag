00:00:00.570 - 00:01:11.340, Speaker A: You in the future. The massive growth in various decentralized services coupled with the growth of various smart contracts and actually the emergence of more and more decentralized services driven by our community and driven by everyone working together to generate high quality data inputs, high quality random number generation, high quality off chain compute is something that is going to continue to jumpstart those new smart contract verticals. So not only are the decentralized services created by the chainlink network and its community critical to making all of these smart contracts happen, but we actually as a community and as a network accelerate the creation of all those smart contracts to the benefit of those decentralized services that then get consumed in greater and greater number right? They get consumed more and more because DeFi grows more dynamic, NFTs grow more, blockchain gaming grows more centralized, insurance grows more and both the breadth of new services and the continual improvement in quality of existing adopted services is something that I think the Chainlink network and the entire Chainlink community should continue to focus on and grow.
