00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.210 - 00:00:03.486, Speaker B: I'd like to look at a few.
00:00:03.508 - 00:00:06.126, Speaker C: Scenarios where people have considered how to.
00:00:06.148 - 00:00:08.654, Speaker D: Approach data delivery, which I once again.
00:00:08.692 - 00:00:11.934, Speaker E: Think holds significant risks. And since this is a conference for.
00:00:11.972 - 00:00:13.982, Speaker B: Developers, I feel it's just useful to.
00:00:14.116 - 00:00:15.626, Speaker C: Kind of describe some of those risks.
00:00:15.658 - 00:00:17.280, Speaker F: And put those out in front of people.
00:00:18.130 - 00:00:19.774, Speaker B: The first risk is the idea that.
00:00:19.812 - 00:00:21.386, Speaker D: We'Re going to go to individual exchanges.
00:00:21.418 - 00:00:23.326, Speaker F: Instead of a data aggregator and that.
00:00:23.348 - 00:00:29.558, Speaker E: We'Re somehow going to get something called market coverage. So market coverage is very important because if you don't cover a part of.
00:00:29.564 - 00:00:31.830, Speaker C: The market where volume suddenly shift to.
00:00:31.900 - 00:00:33.894, Speaker E: You'Re suddenly not getting an accurate price.
00:00:34.012 - 00:00:36.150, Speaker D: This is why all real financial products.
00:00:36.300 - 00:00:40.066, Speaker C: Are fed with data from high quality data firms.
00:00:40.178 - 00:00:42.214, Speaker B: It's because they smooth out this risk.
00:00:42.262 - 00:00:43.754, Speaker E: And I've seen people start to make.
00:00:43.792 - 00:00:49.018, Speaker C: A data aggregation product together with an oracle. And this is an extremely worrying situation.
00:00:49.104 - 00:00:55.374, Speaker D: Because the ability for people to make a data aggregation product is a unique skill set. We actually rely on high quality data.
00:00:55.412 - 00:00:58.682, Speaker F: Aggregators and they feed data into our contract.
00:00:58.746 - 00:00:59.886, Speaker D: So let me just walk you through.
00:00:59.908 - 00:01:03.358, Speaker C: How scenario like this can fail in a very clear and obvious way.
00:01:03.524 - 00:01:05.914, Speaker B: So let's say you started with ABC.
00:01:05.962 - 00:01:07.966, Speaker D: Exchange, but then d e exchange showed.
00:01:07.998 - 00:01:09.826, Speaker E: Up and on Tuesday you were at.
00:01:09.848 - 00:01:11.570, Speaker C: ABC exchange and everything looked great.
00:01:11.640 - 00:01:17.266, Speaker D: But then, because you're not actually running a data aggregation or a data company, d e exchange show up and now.
00:01:17.288 - 00:01:18.286, Speaker C: They have all the volume.
00:01:18.398 - 00:01:19.430, Speaker D: Well, guess what?
00:01:19.500 - 00:01:20.966, Speaker C: All an attacker has to do is.
00:01:20.988 - 00:01:22.626, Speaker D: They now have to manipulate the thinly.
00:01:22.658 - 00:01:25.142, Speaker C: Traded markets that you started with.
00:01:25.276 - 00:01:27.030, Speaker D: And because you're not writing a data.
00:01:27.100 - 00:01:30.326, Speaker E: Company and you don't have a team of 515 or 20 people like some.
00:01:30.348 - 00:01:31.654, Speaker B: Of the data providers that we work.
00:01:31.692 - 00:01:36.738, Speaker C: With, you're suddenly hugely exposed. And this architectural decision alone, which I've.
00:01:36.754 - 00:01:38.546, Speaker E: Seen people start to make, can expose.
00:01:38.578 - 00:01:42.922, Speaker C: Their contract to massive risk of failure, can cause loss.
00:01:42.986 - 00:01:44.398, Speaker E: And that loss will then start to.
00:01:44.404 - 00:01:48.558, Speaker C: Color our entire space, which I would love to avoid. So this is one scenario that I.
00:01:48.564 - 00:01:52.526, Speaker E: Think people should strongly, strongly avoid. And I think anybody who's started going.
00:01:52.548 - 00:01:53.966, Speaker C: Down this path should talk to people.
00:01:53.988 - 00:01:55.486, Speaker E: Who have made financial products and who.
00:01:55.508 - 00:01:57.006, Speaker D: Have used high quality data to make.
00:01:57.028 - 00:01:59.646, Speaker C: Those products and seriously consider whether this.
00:01:59.668 - 00:02:00.714, Speaker B: Is a risk that's worthwhile.
00:02:00.762 - 00:02:04.860, Speaker F: Because in my opinion, it's a very serious risk. Thank.
