00:00:03.450 - 00:01:20.120, Speaker A: Thank you for coming. I am extremely excited for this panel today. I'm Nora, I'm a market analysis manager here at Chainlink Labs. I'd like to introduce locomosini from Avantgarde, Andy Baer from Coindesk indices and Andrew Jones from index Co op. Chain Link offers data feeds, price feeds and rate feeds that enable the portfolio and vault management ecosystem in web three. And I think this panel is a perfect amalgamation of the people to talk to about how the space is growing, how we may be in some ways at the precipice of an extremely large growth pattern in the next few years, and specifically how we mirror a lot of the pieces in the traditional finance market. But in a few ways, like robustness and maybe even security, we can begin to exceed some of those requirements here in web three and in D five.
00:01:20.120 - 00:01:31.398, Speaker A: So Andy, I'm going to start with you. Could you give us a brief overview of who you are, how you ended up here and Coindesk indices.
00:01:31.494 - 00:02:00.260, Speaker B: Sure. Thanks for having me and thanks for having us here. It's great to be here at Smartcon is a great event. Coindesk indices is the largest digital asset indexer, so we serve asset managers, financial exchanges, trading firms, the derivatives market. I got into the space a couple of years ago as a reformed tradfi derivatives person just looking for something with more growth potential and I seem to have found it.
00:02:00.790 - 00:02:02.210, Speaker A: Andrew, how about you?
00:02:02.360 - 00:02:24.700, Speaker C: Yes, it's great to be here. Thanks very much again for inviting and hosting me. My name is Andrew. I worked in Tradfi myself for ten years and I've been contributing to the index cooperative Dow for about three years, working on the product research, implementation and distribution side.
00:02:27.070 - 00:02:50.018, Speaker D: Thanks for having me, guys. Luke, I'm leading business development at Avantgarde Finance. We are the core developers of enzyme, which is one of the leading protocols for on chain asset management. Been on chain for five years. Yeah. Excited to be here and to talk about this topic and always love to come back to Barcelona. I live in Spain so love to come back here.
00:02:50.104 - 00:03:09.340, Speaker A: Nice. Perfect. Luca, the work that enzyme has done has know pretty monumental in the beginning of the space. Enzyme has been around a long time. How have you seen the portfolio and vault management ecosystem change in the last few years?
00:03:09.790 - 00:04:20.666, Speaker D: Yeah, great question. I think there's been lots of ups and downs from a technological perspective, but also from a market perspective. I think speaking about portfolio management, ball management and seeing a bit of the trends in our community of independent ball managers, it really goes with the market sentiment. So you certainly see some emerging trends like certainly much more sophistication and breadth in portfolio management, which goes along with the idea of having more intellectual capital come into this ecosystem, especially from traditional finance. We have here prime examples of people that decided with their lives to actually go and either build in Defi or join some of the teams and so bring their IQ to the system. Right. So I think that said, if we want to go to tangible examples, I think it's worth mentioning in the last year, year and a half, the emergence of defi, trying to capture some of the yields that are given the macroeconomic situation, are present in traditional finance.
00:04:20.666 - 00:04:59.260, Speaker D: So first of all, treasury bills and how they're brought on chain, which led the way of a new possible wave of real world assets. And then on the other side, more on the native crypto side, definitely like Chappelle upgrade, which definitely skyrockets. The adoption of proof of stake and staking as sort of the two money market yields, one coming from traditional finance and the other one is like the native money market fund for crypto. I think that's very good to see for sure.
00:05:00.030 - 00:05:06.814, Speaker A: Andrew. Index co op has been a pretty big name in Defi as well. I would ask you the same question.
00:05:07.012 - 00:05:38.440, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely seen the space mature over the past few years. Projects consolidating towards the larger players as smaller ones have either wound down or pivoted to something else. In terms of TVL for the on chain products, we've seen flows move away from kind of multi asset products more towards the single asset in kind of the search for yield. Examples of that are things like instadap with their ETH yield vaults, and there are others out there as well.
00:05:39.950 - 00:05:44.346, Speaker A: Very interesting. Andy. I think you probably have a different perspective from both.
00:05:44.448 - 00:06:23.442, Speaker B: A very jealous perspective, because as an indexer, our job is to help induce mass adoption. Right. Actually, Coinbase is running a campaign right now reminding everybody that over 50 million Americans hold crypto personally. Right. Still, it's hard to feel as if we've graduated out of this early adopter sort of pioneer phase into mass adoption. And that's what we, as an index company, as a member of the community, are really trying to do. How do we get adoption as broad as possible? Unfortunately, the last mile of good idea and good investment product to user remains kind of stuck.
00:06:23.442 - 00:07:26.874, Speaker B: Not but were infirmed or encased in traditional paths, much like buying a car or buying a house or getting health care. Right. As much disruption is happening that last mile, and the familiarity and the competence and the regulatory structure around it remains steadfast. Right. So we spend a lot of time thinking about spot bitcoin ETFs, or we spend a lot of time thinking about helping funds out and benchmarking them, working up in Canada and now working in APAC in the Middle east, and we lose sight a little bit. And so it's good to be here and see it again. Of the d five projects that allow people to interact directly with web three, which much more exciting, but our job is to broaden the successes that we've had this year in doing that, in addition to the regulatory successes that are coming little by little, is getting people to think about sector investing, to think about breadth, to think about systematic strategies, and now to think about the ETH staking yield and how that can be useful to them.
00:07:27.072 - 00:07:49.890, Speaker A: Very interesting. Luca, I know that as part of enzymes v two, you incorporated chain link price feeds and our oracle service. Could you talk a little bit about how having these price feeds helped enable your V two and the enzyme ecosystem?
00:07:50.230 - 00:08:29.466, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. I think before speaking about enzymes specifically, it's worth underlying that, definitely. Chain link represents a backbone in DFI, many different protocols. I mean, things like primitives, like lending, knowing, having a health check on the loan to value those things wouldn't be possible without having a robust price feed and that dependency. So also like the track record of Chainlink, the Lindy effect, that definitely was part of the decision making when Chainlink became effectively an integral part of the core stack of enzyme.
00:08:29.498 - 00:08:29.646, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:29.668 - 00:09:38.886, Speaker D: So that was an important moment for us. And definitely, I would say if we go down to enzyme at why it matters so much, things like having 24/7 you can do anytime deposit redemption. Like we have the principle of the share price for any vault, and that depends on the reliability of the prices of each price of the underlying assets held in a vault. And therefore having those price feeds is vital. And then you have things like, apart from the classic price feeds, we also have some custom price feeds that are also important. Notably, we have one custom price feed for Nexus mutual, which is one of our biggest users, which actually relies on a specific fee to know the value of the Aum value of their own vault. And that has implication for how they can run their insurance programs and when their capital pool needs to be used.
00:09:38.886 - 00:09:48.014, Speaker D: So those data pipeline are definitely core part of our infrastructure as we also deploy to more institutional users.
00:09:48.162 - 00:10:14.158, Speaker A: Thank you. I think it shows quite a bit to the audience here how much we focus on robustness in the area that we're in now. And I think, Andy, you would be a good person to ask this question, too. Can you talk a bit about indexing in the web three space and how it might differ from traditional finance.
00:10:14.334 - 00:11:00.080, Speaker B: Hopefully we take what's good from traditional finance and we get rid of what's maybe unnecessary. People take for granted things like in the equity markets, a consolidated tape, which is just a piece of the market structure that everybody's used to. If I want to know the price of apple stock, I kind of know that from all the different pools of liquidity. Okay, that's a real price. I can mark myself against that. I can probably trade near know between our two companies have developed that kind of solution in the digital asset world. Having people understand the value of a really good price reference that takes information from different liquidity pools and presents it in a transparent way, that's super important.
00:11:00.080 - 00:11:55.140, Speaker B: A lot of money, tens, hundreds of trillions of dollars is managed against passively in the United States, against indexing in the retirement space, in the retail space, in the institutional space. And so as breadth becomes I agree with your statement earlier. A lot of the interest went away from breadth in the last 1218 months and came back to what more can I do with bitcoin and ETH, we're starting to see the green shoots of spring return and people looking for breadth again. How do you index those things properly in a way that, again, that's transparent, that's useful, that provides the right diversification effect. People are very used to that. They're used to sector thinking, they're used to broad market index thinking, they're used to regional kind of thoughts, to the extent that that makes sense here. So we want to bring a lot of that over and make it as useful as possible, both in the off chain world and the on chain world.
00:11:55.830 - 00:12:26.074, Speaker A: Perfect. I think that's a great segue into my next question, where I want to take this use case for this panel of something that quintessentials built, which is the Ethereum trend indicator. So you're really well known for some of your high profile indices and the ETFs that are built off of the underlying indexes. But can you talk a little bit about the Ethereum trend indicator, how it's different, how it came to be and where you see it enabling the web.
00:12:26.112 - 00:13:24.670, Speaker B: Three ecosystem for sure. So there's passive indexing and then there's active indexing where you're going to hire a manager to ostensibly implement things really well and generate alpha for you and pay them for that. In this case, you pick a good manager, you allocate your fine. In the passive case, you allocate your own investment. If you have to think about rebalancing for risk or for some kind of dynamism in your strategy, that's up to you as the investor. So in the middle, we wanted to help support this idea of systematic investing, which means that a strategy is going to be rebalanced according to a strategy that, you know, ahead of time that's very transparent, it's very outcome oriented. And with the move towards everybody refocusing on bitcoin and ether, really, we thought, well, let's do job number one, which is to help people from selling ether at 1000 in December and then watching it go to 2000 in May.
00:13:24.670 - 00:14:33.940, Speaker B: Right. Purely based on the emotions of the situation, embarrassing Christmas time dinner, conversations with the family, all these kind of emotional things which drive people to trade poorly. That in combination with the fact that big digital assets really do tend to observe trend patterns. Right. News filters into the market slowly, and as that news filters into the market slowly, prices tend to trend until another sense of news kind of becomes the dominant case for price movement. And so using a lot of work that we did in traditional assets, in currencies and commodities and rates, we applied a trend signal to first bitcoin and then ether, and realized that we could have an allocation idea that would get people into cash when things started to look a little turbulent and back full on into ether or bitcoin or whatever the underlying token is, when trends started to look very positive. And so from the coinx indices point of view, we put that indicator up on our screen every day so people can kind of know how they feel about the trend in the market.
00:14:33.940 - 00:14:41.126, Speaker B: And great partners come in and develop allocation strategies around that, that help people kind of navigate the crypto seasons and.
00:14:41.148 - 00:14:54.858, Speaker A: Have a smoother, super, super interesting. And Andrea, I just saw that index co op has a proposal for the ether trend indicator as well. So could you talk a little bit about what your plans are?
00:14:54.944 - 00:15:39.740, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really about just productizing this ether indicator into a token, as Andy was saying there, having that infrastructure to enable that is really useful for people who are looking for quantitative strategies to avoid that emotional decision making. And so we don't have those awkward conversations at Christmas and be less emotionally driven. Very excited about it. It's a new type of product for us, complements the stable that we have between our kind of thematic products, leverage and yields. And so this is a new one. Very excited to launch. Very cool.
00:15:41.310 - 00:15:41.626, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:41.648 - 00:16:33.654, Speaker D: I would like to add what Andrew was saying. The product that Indexcope is launching is more tailored to crypto native. It could be a product for Dow Treasuries, for example. I think what I like about this is that it can be flexibly suitable for different market niches. I think it could be perfectly suitable also for institutional players that basically want to combine a stack of what we can do. The core expertise of chain link actually starting, I guess, with coindice indices, producing a signal of high quality signal chain link bringing that signal to a way that it can be read and then a script that execute automatically those trades on chain. And I guess we can top it off with the ability to make trades that are compliant through an RFQ order system on chain.
00:16:33.654 - 00:17:11.442, Speaker D: Right. Those things, if you combine that stack, you all of a sudden have a product which is perfect for institutional players. And I frankly sometimes hear a lot of objections, and I would like to say to all the people like the program institutional that are listening to us, come with your objections and your why no's. And I'm sure we'll find the answer. Because defi not just enzyme, actually, I'm talking about more general. This space is so good at actually finding answers and finding solutions when you think it's impossible and then next day somebody comes up with an idea and then you have it. So in this case, I think it can check all the boxes.
00:17:11.442 - 00:17:22.460, Speaker D: And for those that don't have a research team, don't have an infrastructure, don't have a way to produce those high quality signals, this is just like a turnkey solution, basically.
00:17:23.070 - 00:18:03.462, Speaker A: Very interesting. I guess my next question is for you, Andrew. So I think this is something that is new that we're seeing from index co op, where you're extremely well known for the products based off of LSDs. And I wonder if you could go a little bit, what, what's your background on that? Like how you've seen that grow in index co op and then also furthering that, what do you think the next big step for portfolio management is?
00:18:03.596 - 00:18:59.610, Speaker C: Yeah, so one of our most popular products over the past year has been the product called ICE, which is the leveraged staked ETH yield product. We also have diversified staked ETH product as well, which is basically all of the liquid staking tokens combined into one. And we do get a lot of inbound requests for, are you going to do one for rocket pool ETH, which we just also launched recently as well. And there'd be more of those. As I was saying earlier, those single asset strategies have proven very popular. But yeah, this new product is something different that can hopefully outperform ETH. That's another kind of target that we set ourselves as well in terms of what's going to make a compelling product.
00:18:59.610 - 00:19:37.522, Speaker C: If you can't outperform ETH, you're taking on a lot of risk for potentially something that doesn't outperform. Moreover, though, we're investing a lot in the underlying tech stack to enable these new partnerships and these new types of products could be anything, really. But yeah, demonstrating to the market that we can work with partners such as Coindesk to bring these products on chain and to open up the distribution to new users as well as to new providers.
00:19:37.666 - 00:19:47.110, Speaker A: Very interesting. Do you feel like you have an interesting user for maybe the Ethereum trend indicator?
00:19:48.030 - 00:20:23.982, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of an open question. I think it can be anything from quote unquote retail. Luca was obviously mentioning their kind of institutions. We have already had some interest from institutions just looking to kind of automate that side of their strategies away from them. And we've also had some inbound from institutions to perhaps white label this product so they can offer it on their platform as well. So again, that's another interesting distribution.
00:20:24.046 - 00:20:26.102, Speaker D: Gene, very cool.
00:20:26.156 - 00:20:41.850, Speaker A: Very interesting. Andy, I kind of wanted to ask you a similar question. Where do you really see as the next big step for portfolio or vault management?
00:20:42.270 - 00:21:04.142, Speaker B: I don't know. How many of you are based in New York? Around New York. Just a really quick anecdote. So last week or a couple of days ago, what's today? Monday. So Friday was rained really hard in New York. And New York can tolerate 1.75 inches of rainfall per hour in terms of the drains underneath New York.
00:21:04.142 - 00:21:07.138, Speaker B: And it rained like two and a quarter inches for a couple of hours.
00:21:07.304 - 00:21:08.366, Speaker A: My street was flooded.
00:21:08.398 - 00:21:59.970, Speaker B: Yeah, everything got flooded. And yet I kept a lunch date with a friend of mine who works at a big investment bank in derivatives, in quantitative investment strategies, where really kind of really cutting edge investor products. And we sat down. So I went up, since everything was flooded, I went up to the floor, we sat by the trading floor and kind of talked about old times. And I said, well, what do you know about Ethereum? And she said, well, I don't really know anything. Right. And it just reminded me that we are in an environment, especially right here, where people are experts, people have self selected, they've educated themselves, but there's so much brain power and more importantly, money out there, smart money, that really has yet to grasp hold of the investment case for Ethereum.
00:21:59.970 - 00:23:00.630, Speaker B: And so that represents just an enormously scalable opportunity. When you add to that the inherent yield in Ethereum from staking, which we have tried to isolate in a staking rate, which we started publishing last month. It adds to this idea of the future of technology, of a platform on which things can be built, and now a monetary policy which delivers a rate and kind of a demand layer kind of spread of icing to that rate, which makes it almost irresistible and a nice counterpoint to bitcoin investing. So I spent the next kind of 15 minutes laying out the investment case for Ethereum. Probably overstayed my welcome a little bit. I think that finding the right way to get people that yield to help complete the product is probably one of our most important jobs. And it's easy to do that in a private fund.
00:23:00.630 - 00:23:18.700, Speaker B: It's easy to do that with liquid staking tokens, but there have to be other ways. And so we're working very hard on trying to develop other indices and benchmarks and reference rates to support that, but also trying to work really hard with product manufacturers to find the best way to bring those kind of products to market.
00:23:19.630 - 00:23:46.482, Speaker A: I wanted to highlight, I think there's been a lot of talk in the last year discussing Ethereum as a perpetual bond. Now that the staking rate has been pretty visible for the last few months. Do you have any interest in staking rates or do you have any products based off of staking for Ethereum right now?
00:23:46.616 - 00:24:25.860, Speaker B: We do. We've launched our staking rate, which is called Caesar, the composite ether staking rate. We're doing that with coin fund that launched back in mid August. And we publish that every day on our website, coindeskmarkets.com. So you can see it and you see how it's evolved over the last several days, we're going to be releasing a total return ether index, which will include the rate every day. We've already licensed that to private funds, which are offering sort of an ETH plus home staked ETH plus investment strategy to there. And I think that's just going to be a huge market, very simple, but if implemented properly, I think can really scale up pretty large.
00:24:25.860 - 00:25:04.874, Speaker B: And the last thing that we're doing, which I think is really very exciting, is starting to support a derivatives market on the rate. So fixed floating swaps on the rates, NDFs on the rates. All right now in the ISDA space with ISda documentation and ISda dealers. But we'd love to find a way as the months and quarters roll on, to bring that onto regulated exchanges. Maybe have an ETH total return futures contract somewhere, and then you can really sort of. Then you have kind of liquid product support to get ETFs into the market and other stuff like that really help litify this investment case for Ethereum. That includes the entire value stack.
00:25:05.002 - 00:25:39.206, Speaker A: I feel like if you get any one of us into a room and sit down and ask us, do you think that the staking rate is the next risk free rate? We would be well past the time for this panel. Before we finish debating or answering the question, Luca, we only have a little bit of time left, but I want to ask you the same question. Where do you see the portfolio vault management space growing in the next few years, and what kind of pieces have been added in the last few months to really add to that?
00:25:39.388 - 00:26:57.870, Speaker D: Yeah, I think going back to, I guess to some of the points that I raised earlier, I think also what gets me really excited is to see institutional adoptions of DeFi solutions. I mean, of course we all love to see an ETF spot ETF coming and having that type of exposure in a totally traditional way and sense, but we also like to see institutions starting to get their hands in and playing with DeFi, really. And I guess that brings the best of both world, especially if we can have compliance in place in a purely on chain, I guess like a permission way of using DeFi. And I think the world probably will develop DeFi will be like a spectrum where you have users that use a totally permissionless and open DeFi, just connecting their wallet, and you'll have institutions that have a more permissioned and a way to funnel funds and assets in a more traditional way, but still using the underlying technology. So that really gets me a lot of excitement. And then I think we see the emergence of automation really being important, and that's heavily requested. I think that's where you see then algorithm signals how they can combine.
00:26:57.870 - 00:27:24.150, Speaker D: What really gets me excited is to see that if we combine the tax stacks, then like build new classes of products and things that probably did not even exist in traditional finance, that I'm having just to replicate something that already existed. I think the level of creativity that this technological melting pot can create is really, truly uncanny.
00:27:26.410 - 00:27:45.230, Speaker A: Quick, thank you to the three of you for joining this panel. I think this is a pretty momentous think tank as someone who is in the industry of people's voices that we could get. If you have any questions for us, we'll be around in the conference later today, but thanks for speaking.
00:27:45.380 - 00:27:46.510, Speaker B: Thanks for, thank you so much.
00:27:46.580 - 00:27:46.860, Speaker C: Thank you.
