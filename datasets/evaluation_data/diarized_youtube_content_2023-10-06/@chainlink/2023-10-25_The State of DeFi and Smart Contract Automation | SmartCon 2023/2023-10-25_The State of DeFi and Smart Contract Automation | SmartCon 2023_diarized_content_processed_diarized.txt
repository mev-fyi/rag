00:00:02.810 - 00:00:19.802, Speaker A: All right, welcome to the panel on the state of Defi and smart contract automation. Today I'm joined by a great panel of guests. I'll let each of you introduce yourselves individually. Just tell us who you are and maybe a little bit about your project, starting with Lucas.
00:00:19.866 - 00:00:35.640, Speaker B: Yeah. Hello everybody, my name is Lucas, I'm one of the business development assistants at Gravity Finance. We just delve into the realm of automated DeFi and trying to provide simplified strategies for people to use and we automate the back end of things and handle the complex stuff for you.
00:00:36.570 - 00:00:52.350, Speaker C: Hey everyone, I'm Matt, co founder of Robolabs. Since we were building tooling and infrastructure for Defi projects to use to manage their data pipelines. And also we previously ran Delta neutral vaults and heavily used automation.
00:00:53.890 - 00:01:11.140, Speaker D: Hi everyone, I'm Rafael, I work at the origin protocol. We currently have two tokens that we call otokens, that is OUSD and Oeth, and they are rebasing stable coins that generate yield automatically for you.
00:01:12.310 - 00:01:45.760, Speaker E: Hi everybody, my name is Vladimir Simkowski, I'm a CTO of DMA Labs. We are developing arm behind ishi protocol and each provide automated liquidity management for concentrated liquidity on uniswap with three algebra and all kind of forks, different chains. We have about 100 automated vaults right now and this number seems to be doubling every few months. And automation is a huge part of our success.
00:01:46.770 - 00:02:13.702, Speaker A: Great, yeah, thanks all. So as you can tell, we've got a diverse group of projects here. So I want to speak a little bit about. Or I want to have each of you speak a little bit about how you're using automation in particular. And I'd like to start with Raphael. So Raphael from origin, you've been using automation probably the longest of anyone on the panel and specifically for rebasing for your project. So I'd love for you to tell us a little bit more about that.
00:02:13.702 - 00:02:21.446, Speaker A: How have you considered building things out and. Yeah, what have you considered along the way as you've automated things?
00:02:21.548 - 00:02:48.558, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So with our stable coins, what we have is that we generate automatically the yield for you. Right. So the whole value proposition is that you hold the stable coin and it rebases automatically for you. So there's a lot of automation that happens there. Right. So the way that we use chainlink keeper is that we want to ensure a very good user experience for everyone that is holding our token.
00:02:48.558 - 00:03:26.634, Speaker D: So we ensure that every day there is a rebase in event and then you will see the value of your token going up. Right. So the way that we also build this contract is that we try to make them as simple as possible. So we kind of have two functions, which is like, should it run or run? But then everything else, the whole complexity part goes through the standard smart contract process that we do with all of audits and things like that. So that's more or less how we use it intentionally.
00:03:26.682 - 00:03:47.282, Speaker A: Very simple. It sounds cool. Yeah, we'll go into a little bit about the different mechanisms, maybe later on. For you specifically, I'd like to move on to Vlad. So Vlad, like you mentioned, automated liquidity management for V three. There's a lot that goes into that, I know that for sure. You've got, like you said, over 100 vaults that you're automating.
00:03:47.282 - 00:03:53.800, Speaker A: Tell us a little bit about that, what that journey has been like, developing those contracts and the impact it's had.
00:03:54.170 - 00:04:35.570, Speaker E: Yeah, it's good. You mentioned it's a journey because it's a journey for us. We started with just the concept of a vault that has several positions in uniswap pool and some idea how we can manage those positions while kind of protecting depositors from Il and concentrating at the same time. And initially we were just rebalancing liquidity manually. It was very cumbersome. The idea worked, but it wasn't optimal. Then we started to create some contracts around the flow and do like a push button, like operator push a button.
00:04:35.570 - 00:05:16.414, Speaker E: All the calculations done on chain and everything rebalances. It was better. Still not good enough. And finally we get to the point when we were confident enough that we can actually automate the whole thing using chain link keepers. And that's what we did, I think around December last year, and as soon as we'd done it, profitability of the whole kind of management system went about five x. So it was huge leap like that. And if you look at automation itself, it may be kind of simple concept like chain link keeper just pokes our rebalancing strategy.
00:05:16.414 - 00:06:04.286, Speaker E: Every block and strategy just looks, oh, do I want to rebalance the vault? And if I want to rebalance the vault, is it safe to do it? Right? And if answer is yes to both questions, then the actual transaction has been executed. Simple enough. The complexity comes into actually the safety part of the question, right? Is it safe enough to move liquidity at this particular time? And when it is safe, and that's where most of the effort went with automating our strategies. We've done it. Now we're expanding to multiple chains, multiple amms approaching us, saying we want it. And obviously chain link keeper is a huge part of that. So we have about 100 of them now.
00:06:04.468 - 00:06:11.214, Speaker A: It's pretty good. You mentioned these safety parameters. What are they? If you can share a little bit more about what you're checking on chain.
00:06:11.342 - 00:06:51.274, Speaker E: Well, moving liquidity in a pool is inherently unsafe, right? And with automation, even so, because it's all in the open, like, people know that's what you are doing. Actually perform up kit function is public after all. Right? So the strategy needs to be smart enough not to move liquidity. When there is any chance that there is something funkins going on in the pool, somebody is manipulating it. That's why we've built multiple layers of protection. So we're using delayed rebalances. So yes, we want to rebalance.
00:06:51.274 - 00:07:17.094, Speaker E: We don't do it right away. We initiate it. We check again, maybe like five minutes later, see what happened within this time period. If nothing bad happened, maybe we will rebalance. We check several know t wop oracles, fastwap swallowed swap comparing what's going on there. Gas takes a role as well. Right? And a few other things on top of that.
00:07:17.094 - 00:07:28.460, Speaker E: But the whole sequence of layers of protection had to be built in to actually be able to use it.
00:07:28.910 - 00:07:56.870, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. Thanks. And a few of you have mentioned this. Perform upkeep, check upkeep, just for some context. The way Chainlink automation works is in order to use it, you write a contract that has two functions, check upkeep and perform upkeep. The former is just a way to write conditions, and when those conditions are met, it'll execute your transaction. And the details of that transaction are in that perform upkeep function.
00:07:56.870 - 00:08:31.342, Speaker A: So, as you mentioned, all that logic lives on chain. So it's pretty interesting and introduces some interesting design decisions that need to be made. Thanks for that, Lucas. So let's talk about gravityfi a little bit. Gravityfi is a really cool concept, this concept of silos. Well, I don't want to speak too much for you, but it's this way to automate really interesting defi strategies. So I'd love for you to tell us a little bit more about those, how they're built, what goes into deciding what goes into a strategy, send it off to you.
00:08:31.396 - 00:09:25.540, Speaker B: Yeah, well, silos is a very interesting product that we've been working on for a while, made significantly easier with Chainlink automation, thankfully, because we started off this journey of wanting to build complex strategies that the end result would be any specific user can pick those up and start using them hyper complex and then bring them to a real basic one button deployment. And for us to create those strategies is a very manual task. We have to go into, say, talk to Kyberswap, look at sort of liquidity, and go there and try and go. We'll put and build the strategy together. We'll manually go and do everything ourselves. We'll check all of the addresses or all the swaps and routes that have to be taken and do, and then manually compile those together into a massive just order list, essentially that then executes it for the user. And that can be a very lengthy process for us to build.
00:09:25.540 - 00:10:08.330, Speaker B: And that's probably one of our biggest challenges that we face at the moment, is talking to projects, building those and putting them together and creating all of those different strategies for people to access. In terms of silos itself, we've been hugely supported by Chainlink and the automation there. When we started off, we were thinking about originally doing it by ourselves and creating those by ourselves. But the benefits of Chainlink's automation is that it's a decentralized network. What we might have made with various computers across the place would have been very centralized and in control of us, which didn't necessarily match the ethos of what we wanted to do. But at the time, there was no other way. And so being able to jump in and start using the automation side of that's been really beneficial.
00:10:08.490 - 00:10:09.200, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:10:09.650 - 00:10:13.178, Speaker A: Do you have a favorite silo, if I can ask, and put you on the spot?
00:10:13.354 - 00:10:38.200, Speaker B: We have tons of different silos. For example, we can run collateral to debt ratios and pull little bits of extra yield that you might not be able to get as a general user. Things really complex like that. My mother quite enjoys going into the higher aprs knowing that there's not as much risk. But myself, my favorite is definitely just the dollar cost, average silo, to be honest. Just buy $10 of chain link a day and just slowly build that up.
00:10:38.510 - 00:11:03.394, Speaker A: Love it. Great, thanks. And then, Matt, so you're a bit unique on this panel. Right. Robo Labs had a product called Robovault that used automation pretty heavily. Now you're, again, I don't want to speak for you, but you're helping some other projects out with automation. I'd love for you to tell us a little bit more about that, your approach to, I guess, implementing automation yourself and for others.
00:11:03.592 - 00:11:55.300, Speaker C: Yeah, so originally, I guess about two years ago, we started with this product, Robovault, doing these automated delta neutral strategies on chain. Our journey was pretty interesting, like we initially started building our own keepers. I would say it didn't go well it essentially led to myself and my co founder running like a 24 hours shift, because we just couldn't trust that what if they break? Potentially our users might lose money. And that actually did happen in one case where the keepers failed. So then we did switch to Chainlink automation. We had that running in parallel with our own, and it was just night and day difference where the chain link automation was much more reliable, meant we could actually get some sleep, know that things weren't going to break.
00:11:56.230 - 00:11:56.594, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:56.632 - 00:12:31.658, Speaker C: And then more recently we've pivoted a bit to more tooling infrastructure, working with other protocols and. Yeah, a number of those protocols doing similar stuff. And we're essentially like helping them implement automation. So kind of helping them understand what they need to do on the smart contract side, because if you just have automation, it could go rogue and do something wrong. There could be like vulnerabilities. If the automation is moving money around, you want to make sure there's protection against things like mev, et cetera.
00:12:31.834 - 00:12:32.222, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:12:32.276 - 00:12:34.398, Speaker C: So I guess that's the high level of it.
00:12:34.484 - 00:13:01.000, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good transition. You've identified some challenges that these projects have had, and part of your business exists because it's not necessarily easy to build these automations and take all the different complexities into consideration. So kind of question for the group, what are some of the unique challenges in building out these automations? What issues have you run into? How have you overcome them?
00:13:02.250 - 00:13:31.630, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say if I could take it. Go ahead. We went through the stage of trying to build this ourselves, trying to actually build our own automation product. It seems like quite simple. It seems like, okay, you just have something that reads a chain and triggers a transaction when some conditions are met. But there's so much complexity alongside that. So gas is a huge thing.
00:13:31.630 - 00:13:39.380, Speaker C: Gas is very volatile and gas works very differently, chain to chain. So that's one thing that can break.
00:13:40.550 - 00:13:40.962, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:13:41.016 - 00:14:19.840, Speaker C: And then just the security side of things, making sure that you have this automation that works and it's not going to go rogue. So like one example, not really like smart contract, but I know a friend who's built like a trading bot, and you see this with people doing Mev, sometimes they'll get an error and that automation will go rogue and just burn a bunch of money and trigger. So making sure you also have the logic within the smart contract to protect against that is really important. I'd say those are two biggest complexities in my.
00:14:20.370 - 00:14:54.438, Speaker E: So I guess I can add. Well, before I add, I actually want to say special thank you to Matt over here. And I told him just a few minutes ago, but they were inspiration for us to build our automation. Like maybe a year and a half ago, our CEO came to us and said, look guys, they've done it, you should do it. And kind of that's how we started on that path. But it's kind of a warning for anybody who wants to do this. It's not a normal software development.
00:14:54.438 - 00:15:40.250, Speaker E: Right. You can take your estimation how much time it's going to take and maybe multiply it by four and maybe you'll get close to it because amount of testing and oversight and just breaking your head trying to think of what could go wrong is just enormous with this kind of development. It's doable, we've done it, but just be prepared. It's not a light thing to take and just do it. Just triple, quadruple your estimations to do it properly, to test it properly, to go through the audits, and any help you can get, get it, and only then go to production.
00:15:40.990 - 00:16:21.720, Speaker B: I think one of the most important parts of all of the challenges that we face is that we are in defi and we are dealing with people's money. All it takes is one little part going wrong in that automation there and the money's gone and security. For people's money to be able to do, have the freedom and use automation, they need to be able to do that securely and with trust in the process of doing that. And so I think a lot of the challenges that we face, you cannot predict what they are until you actually come into them and run into those scenarios that you hit, because you just can't predict some of those things. Making sure you've got all the right checking parameters and all of those things, you can still be caught out and you can just never predict some of those that sort of come along.
00:16:22.410 - 00:16:22.822, Speaker A: Sure.
00:16:22.876 - 00:16:58.354, Speaker D: Yeah. And for origin, we have been really thinking about this part of automation, right. And I feel like I'm going to go in where you wanted to touch in, which is like, we take automation as really part of all the contracts that we're building. And the way that we think about that is that if the automation rely on Nas to happen, then you are a centralization point of failure, let's put it like that. Right. So the way that we see this is through incentivization. So every part that we are thinking about, okay, we need an automation here.
00:16:58.354 - 00:17:37.486, Speaker D: How can we make sure that there is an incentive for anyone, like whoever wants to be calling that contract can call it and get a reward for it. Right. So one of the parts that we use this is over harvesting rewards. So in some of the strategies that we run in Defi, we collect rewards and harvest and coming back with the same token. So all of this process is open and anyone can call it. Right. So then it goes to the part that you touch with the gas fees, then is like, is it profitable for me to call this? And then the approach that we take it.
00:17:37.486 - 00:17:50.340, Speaker D: Right. But again, as all the automation part, things can go rogue. Someone might not call that contract even if it's profitable. So you always need to have something to make sure that the user experience will be good enough.
00:17:51.270 - 00:17:56.622, Speaker A: Do you know how often it's the case that a user calls it versus chainlink automation?
00:17:56.766 - 00:18:00.070, Speaker D: Well, we have a couple of bots, to be honest, that call them. Right.
00:18:00.140 - 00:18:00.422, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:00.476 - 00:18:07.158, Speaker D: We don't know who they are. Maybe it's one of the dads, whatever works, but it's always there.
00:18:07.244 - 00:18:24.640, Speaker A: Yeah, great. And maybe we just touched on this, but why not run this stuff on your own? I think we probably each touched on it individually, but I'd like to hear the answer straight up. Why not run this on your own? What benefits have you seen specifically from Chainlink automation that you value?
00:18:25.970 - 00:19:29.006, Speaker E: Well, I guess I can start. Well, reliability is number one basically, right? And yes, like Matt said, I want to sleep at night and that allows me to do so. And we went through the situation with like push button and it's just too much time. And with Chainlink, it's out there, it's running, we don't have to worry about it also helps us with the gas. So there is some smart things built in into keepers that kind of lessen the risk of overpaying for our transactions. We do have to implement our own solutions on chains where chain linkers are not available, like ZkvM comes to mind. But I consider that as a temporary stop gap measure until you guys catch up and we can switch.
00:19:29.006 - 00:19:37.410, Speaker E: Because really with reliability that chili provides, we would rather use you and do it by ourselves.
00:19:39.510 - 00:20:07.086, Speaker D: Maybe I can call Max. Right. So I see this as not much different than any kind of software development that you have. Or if you are in web two or not, automation running all of this makes sure that it's in a decentralized way. It's not part of our core business. Our core business is building d five products that generate yields. And it's the same case when you go in web two, right? Like whatever is not part of your core business.
00:20:07.086 - 00:20:13.200, Speaker D: You outsource that and you get a service that does that for you very well. And I feel like this is the case.
00:20:13.810 - 00:20:50.380, Speaker B: I think some of the benefits of it as well is when you are building, you typically are used to having those fundamental building blocks there. But starting off where we were, it was just the open vastness of. Okay, well, this is our predicted time to do it. We sort of said it might take about six months to build, and then, as you know, developer time that'll all of a sudden become a lot more. It's not just the automation side, but I think also the relationships that we have with Chainlink now and being able to bounce ideas off of. And it's not just a sole endeavor, it's actually a bit more than that. And people working together essentially, and we can ask the questions and you might give answers to problems that other projects have faced as well to help.
00:20:51.230 - 00:21:25.560, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think from our perspective, there is a lot of time. If you wanted to try and build this yourself, it is like massive amount of dev time. You would sink into it. And you're probably like kidding yourself if you're going to build something as reliable as Chainlink, pretty much. If Chainlink breaks like all defi breaks in reality. So if you think you can build something as reliable as that, you're probably in for a bit of a kick in the bum and a wake up call.
00:21:27.130 - 00:21:39.930, Speaker A: Yeah. So all of you have spent a lot of time building these contracts and automations. What recommendations do you have for those that are looking to build automations for themselves to mitigate risks?
00:21:43.330 - 00:22:34.606, Speaker C: One really good practice we had was before opening anything to the public, run it for at least like two weeks or a week with the automation, then you can just ideally see edge cases, et cetera. And I think making sure the smart contracts are really robust because you could be automating something that has something broken in the smart contracts. And that, as you're saying, could potentially lead to users losing money if it's like a defi thing. So I think really just like taking a cautious approach and understanding when things are automated and that's moving money around, there is the potential for things to go wrong.
00:22:34.788 - 00:23:15.766, Speaker B: Test again, maybe, and then once you've tested it after that again, push it out to some people and get them to test it. So we have a joke inside gravity finance. And all of our community keeps saying, when? When's the product coming? When's it all coming? And it's because we take the time and we test it to make sure it's right. We like to run it off to groups of those people that are a bit more risk taking and want to try it early, and we can test with those and get the feedback and make sure that we're not having anything go wrong. Monitor everything because something will always pop up that you're never expecting. And if you can mitigate those risks on the front end, rather than pushing it out to the retail product and seeing something catastrophic, you can stop all that. Sort of on the development side, I'm.
00:23:15.798 - 00:23:17.110, Speaker A: Starting to see a theme.
00:23:17.270 - 00:24:12.394, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay. For us, we take also a very strong approach on developing any smart contract that it goes really to why are we even building this in the first place? And then it goes to, even before touching any development, kind of like design decisions, is this actually solving the problem that we initially thought and then go after this is done? Testing, testing, testing and really preparing. I think one of the very important parts is how do you prepare yourself for an audit? Because the person who is going to audit you has very limited time as well. So if you can upfront with why did you took those decisions? And some scope like saying what does this intend to do? It also helps a lot the work of the auditors to do that and work with good auditors. This is one that I learned. It's good advice.
00:24:12.442 - 00:24:12.894, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:13.012 - 00:24:42.518, Speaker E: So you already kind of answered the question. Just one thing I want to add is do not rely on off chain data with your automated contracts. Do everything 100% on chain. I know, perform upkeep can take the parameter in and you can pass some data to it. Don't do it. Just make sure everything is calculated and checked on chain. Because it's public.
00:24:42.518 - 00:24:50.950, Speaker E: Anybody can call it. They can manipulate off chain data in some way that you cannot even imagine. Just make sure it's all contained.
00:24:51.930 - 00:25:23.860, Speaker C: I think one other thing, what Raphael was saying about also public, there's like the ability for public people to call these functions like having fallbacks. So you could have chain link automation plus some fallback. Whether that be like public users could potentially call it as well run their own bots. Because then you never know. Maybe Chainlink could potentially fail. Although it's proven to be extremely lightweight. Fallbacks are always good.
00:25:23.860 - 00:25:27.320, Speaker C: Just some redundancy would be like another thing.
00:25:28.250 - 00:25:29.158, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah.
00:25:29.244 - 00:25:32.102, Speaker D: Not having one single point. Of course.
00:25:32.236 - 00:25:49.450, Speaker A: Of course. Only a few minutes left here. I'll ask a more general question for the group. Where do you see the future of Defi in the next few years? And if you want to include where you see automation in the state of Defi in a few years, that would be nice. To hear as well. Who wants to kick it off?
00:25:49.600 - 00:26:18.760, Speaker E: I can start. Well, issue is going to dominate the world, right? That's right answer. But no, I think I would probably. Well, I'm very bullish on Defi in general. I think with all of the disasters happening with centralized exchanges, we'll have more money coming in into Defi. We'll have real world assets tokenized. So there will be much more to work with in our space.
00:26:18.760 - 00:27:00.702, Speaker E: But specifically with liquidity management, I think we are really going there. I know people have been putting liquidity on different amms and managing them manually. Some companies provided services to manage liquidity manually. I think it's going to come to the end. So the services that will be provided will be automated. So liquidity management will become more and more automated and it's just going to happen. And then amms, more and more of them just moving into concentrated liquidity.
00:27:00.702 - 00:27:23.500, Speaker E: Especially now with Uniswap, with three forks appearing everywhere and every single one of them, they need automated liquidity management. And you see companies like us and others just popping up, providing that kind of service and closing that niche. It's just going to continue until it's all automated in this space.
00:27:23.870 - 00:27:54.260, Speaker B: I think the future of Defi is also dependent on the future of crypto. And I think crypto is inevitable. Everyone will start using it one day. But this special place in DeFi is that people that are in Defi at the moment have already had that awareness of that they want to do something with their money and do something better with it. And so I think the future of Defi will definitely have things like tokenized real world assets coming in, because these are already people that understand what to do with their money and they want to optimize it. And optimization usually comes through automation or other processes like that.
00:27:55.690 - 00:28:41.140, Speaker C: Yeah, I think just like the biggest thing is just going to be improving the user experience right now. It's still pretty terrible for just the average person who's not like a crypto nerd to get into Defi and use it. And ideally it would just be like abstracted ways. I think things like intents, account, abstraction potentially going to be quite big in just helping get adopted. And then, yeah, I see the future is, ideally, it's kind of just like you don't really even know you're using defi. It's just like a seamless kind of interaction and just replaces a lot of the things we do now, and ideally in a much more efficient and transparent way.
00:28:42.390 - 00:29:30.106, Speaker D: It's a big question, right? I think it could take like an hour answering that. But I would try to really focus on maybe automation part, because I feel like right now there is, I don't know, every time that I think about the five products, I always try to segregate them between a primitive and an aggregator. And really touching the point of user experience. I feel like aggregators will really follow, I don't know, a lot of defi automation to make sure that you offer this amazing user experience like you have in tradifies that, hey, I deposit my money here and it just generates more yield. I don't need to compound and do any other things like that. Right? So I feel like that's going to be like the path.
00:29:30.218 - 00:29:37.300, Speaker A: Yeah. Excellent. Well, we're at time. Thank you all so much. Thanks for joining us today.
