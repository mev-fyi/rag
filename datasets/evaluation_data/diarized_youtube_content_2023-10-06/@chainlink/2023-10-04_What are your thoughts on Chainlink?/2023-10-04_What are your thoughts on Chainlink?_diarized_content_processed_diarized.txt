00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.514, Speaker C: What are your thoughts on Chainlink?
00:00:01.642 - 00:00:21.086, Speaker B: I think it's one of the most future proof web three technologies. Like we will always need to bring off chain data on chain we need Oracle networks and now with the CCIP connecting all the different blockchains, it just seems like every new release they do makes me think like, okay, this is again like a paradigm shift to the next level.
00:00:21.268 - 00:00:27.654, Speaker C: Usually conveys trust to a lot of users, especially the users of lending protocol. They trust the chain link.
00:00:27.692 - 00:00:42.518, Speaker A: Oracle I think most excited about the new data streams launch. I think it's going to be one of the main elements to bring the adoption of web three to web two. Yeah, we are creating a new level of companies not only in web two but also in web three.
00:00:42.604 - 00:00:55.340, Speaker C: I think it's a really awesome piece of technology and it's going to lay the bedrock for the next stage of finance and the overall Internet. We go where chainlink goes because you've got features that we cannot do without.
