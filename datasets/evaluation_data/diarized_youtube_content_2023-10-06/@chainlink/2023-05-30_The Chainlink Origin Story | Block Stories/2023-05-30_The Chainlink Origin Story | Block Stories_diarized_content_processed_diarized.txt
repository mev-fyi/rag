00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.162, Speaker A: Chainlink is the leading web3 service provider.
00:00:03.226 - 00:00:06.778, Speaker B: Chainlink is now the industry standard, powering all DFI and beyond.
00:00:06.874 - 00:00:25.014, Speaker A: Chainlink is going through really an amazing phase now. The chainlink vision is cryptographic. Truth is always the right answer. If you look at how the world works and you say, I think the world should be more transparent, then this is probably a good industry for you to think about. Crypto, web3, whatever we call it, chainlink brings a lot of this stuff to life.
00:00:25.092 - 00:00:27.254, Speaker C: Web three is where all the action's at.
00:00:27.372 - 00:00:29.922, Speaker B: You need a web3 strategy.
00:00:29.986 - 00:00:33.510, Speaker D: This is how we can make the most impact and help the whole ecosystem.
00:00:34.730 - 00:00:39.560, Speaker A: It's something that many people agree is the way the world will work going forward.
00:00:50.370 - 00:00:50.926, Speaker C: It.
00:00:51.028 - 00:00:54.922, Speaker A: And I'm just looking at you right into this thing in the camera.
00:00:54.986 - 00:00:58.240, Speaker D: Okay. Hey, cool.
00:01:02.130 - 00:01:06.130, Speaker A: The world is currently built on a system of paper promises.
00:01:07.430 - 00:01:21.670, Speaker D: There are many signs, if you look around, of degrading trust in traditional institutions. You can see it in media, in government, financial policy. There are places where people are not keeping their promises.
00:01:22.250 - 00:01:32.410, Speaker A: The 2008 financial crisis was a good example of the negative effect of paper promises, and society and individuals had to pay for that. That's something that we wanted to solve.
00:01:33.790 - 00:01:34.474, Speaker D: This is nice.
00:01:34.512 - 00:01:37.238, Speaker A: Sergey, I don't think they're recording. Are you guys recording?
00:01:37.334 - 00:01:44.862, Speaker D: Sergey and I met in college. We're very different. The things that freak me out do not freak him out, and vice versa. So we kind of counterbalance each other.
00:01:44.996 - 00:01:49.278, Speaker A: When I got into the blockchain industry, it described the potential of it to him.
00:01:49.364 - 00:01:56.158, Speaker D: I think blockchain was just such an exciting idea. Specifically, once it got into sort of smart contracts. We met up for tacos, right?
00:01:56.244 - 00:01:57.938, Speaker A: Worked together until 03:00 a.m. And then.
00:01:57.944 - 00:02:08.550, Speaker D: I remember, next thing. I just woke up next morning and rode my bike over, met you in the office. We kept working. Data today is gathered from many places. It's just a matter of how do you turn it into something usable.
00:02:08.970 - 00:02:23.290, Speaker A: Our technology allows people to form relationships without the need to put your faith in anyone's promises. Because once you cryptographically commit to something and you're not relying on promises, you're relying on mathematics.
00:02:27.180 - 00:02:46.800, Speaker D: There was a lot of competition early on. We quietly kept our heads down, but built the next working version. What we mean by keep your head down and build is don't worry about creating lots of hype. Just focus on delivering value and driving the ecosystem forward. And to be fair, we were surrounded by people that were not delivering.
00:02:51.780 - 00:02:52.336, Speaker C: You.
00:02:52.438 - 00:02:58.484, Speaker D: There was originally either. The skepticism of this problem is too small or this problem is too large.
00:02:58.602 - 00:03:20.360, Speaker A: We're still in this period of very cyclical boom and bust cycles where everyone's like, blockchains are the best, blockchains are the worst. I've actually always viewed skepticism as a very positive signal. People that shy away from skepticism, they're missing out on the future. And what they're gaining is the approval of their peers, which I never really valued very highly.
00:03:20.940 - 00:03:32.510, Speaker D: We just focused on delivering the product, because in a world filled with all of this hype, delivering what we had promised people was what really seemed important. And what I found is smart people want to work on hard problems.
00:03:35.300 - 00:03:40.588, Speaker C: In the last year and months, we've had a few other amazing new people join.
00:03:40.684 - 00:03:44.908, Speaker E: Sergey's vision of a world powered by fruit really resonated.
00:03:45.004 - 00:03:52.884, Speaker F: I could immediately see Chainlink fills a missing link. So this is your new platform, off chain infrastructure for building web.
00:03:52.922 - 00:04:04.692, Speaker A: Three apps. Back when I joined Chainlink Labs, we were, like, 20 people. Since then, the company has developed a lot. It's only logical to bring on experienced folks that have worked in much larger orgs.
00:04:04.756 - 00:04:08.520, Speaker F: I spent the past two decades working in tech.
00:04:08.590 - 00:04:11.444, Speaker E: I was at Google, leading Tensorflow, Microsoft.
00:04:11.492 - 00:04:13.880, Speaker F: VMware, VM, the libra project.
00:04:14.030 - 00:04:20.972, Speaker A: The people joining the chain link labs are experienced, thoughtful professionals willing to be part of something new at the early.
00:04:21.026 - 00:04:29.840, Speaker E: Stages, those big waves of innovation, there's always this moment where things start to mature, and from then on, they accelerate.
00:04:35.620 - 00:04:45.876, Speaker D: The goal of Chainlink is to enable creators. We want to provide people the tools they need to enable their own economic future. Let's give it up for the ogs here.
00:04:45.978 - 00:05:15.712, Speaker A: Welcome. These are. We would not be here without you. I'm really impressed by the dedication and the ownership that people have towards building the Chainlink network. There's someone here who can speak a lot more about innovation and infrastructure. Let's bring up Sergey. We have a lead of multiple years, the best users, over 80% market share, which, once again, you should all really be proud of.
00:05:15.712 - 00:05:33.844, Speaker A: I think it's great. I'm really thrilled to be working with people that see that what we're working on will change the way that entire industries work. Me and Steve sit down every couple of months to think through the deeper problems.
00:05:33.962 - 00:05:39.248, Speaker D: We spend less time together, but at its core, yeah, we're still friends and partners.
00:05:39.344 - 00:05:44.600, Speaker A: We do tacos sometimes, but I think most of the time, we're so busy thinking, we don't even notice what we're eating.
00:05:48.300 - 00:05:51.480, Speaker D: As for the future of Chainlink, we are the industry standard.
00:05:51.630 - 00:05:58.328, Speaker A: There are endless possibilities the infrastructure we make isn't a nicety, it's actually a necessity.
00:05:58.504 - 00:06:03.020, Speaker D: We've enabled trillions of dollars of value to move through blockchains and d five.
00:06:03.090 - 00:06:06.332, Speaker A: And that's how we've gotten to 80% plus of market share.
00:06:06.466 - 00:06:11.664, Speaker D: We partnered with Chainlink because you need oracle to tell you what's happening in the outside world.
00:06:11.782 - 00:06:16.128, Speaker B: I really want to thank everyone in this room. We're the clear leaders. That feels great.
00:06:16.214 - 00:06:21.840, Speaker G: If your vision is that smart contracts is going to run the business process of the future, Chainlink is a perfect partner.
00:06:21.920 - 00:06:47.690, Speaker A: We already know how to keep winning, and that's just keep being reliable. We've powered 7 trillion in transactions. That's great news. That's the beginning. That's the tip of the iceberg. It's kind of beyond belief how far everything has gone and how quickly it's gotten there. Chainlink's goal is to just accelerate the adoption of cryptographic truth to everything from gaming to insurance to the financial industry to many other industries, and change people's lives.
