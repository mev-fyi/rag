00:00:00.330 - 00:00:23.934, Speaker A: Hello everybody. We are here. Our last day. Ten days of the chain link boot camp. Congrats to all of you that are with me all these days and create amazing smart contests. I'm so happy, so excited with you. It's like amazing to be here.
00:00:23.934 - 00:01:07.410, Speaker A: It was a great experience and wow, how can we think about this? Your commitment in ten days. It was really amazing. I'm pretty sure that you change your life because you are the year so well. You started doing this kind of commit to study and to be here for ten days and learn everything and you are in the right path to go forward and learn more and more. And I think it is. I'm really so proud of you. And this is today, pet.
00:01:07.410 - 00:01:54.048, Speaker A: So let's go over there. Yeah, this is interesting, Vandana, including that I'd like to do a comment related to you and talk about my history. I'm so proud of you because I know how it's hard when we are stuck when we cannot do something. But instead of you give up, instead of you don't do the other sessions. You was here with us all time. You ask help and you learned a lot. Exactly.
00:01:54.048 - 00:02:33.888, Speaker A: Because of this as well. And this. Remember when I was starting like when I starting 20, 17, 18, we didn't have this kind of content online. So the best way for me to learn, especially that I'm from Brazil, is to go to in person conference around the world. And I remember one of my first developer conference related to blockchain. It was Trufflecom in Portland in 2018 and I was so lost over there. I couldn't do not of the exercise but I was asking helper all the time.
00:02:33.888 - 00:03:27.970, Speaker A: Hey, I didn't, hey, I didn't understand and like the other students around me try to help including my laptop, sometimes panting the hands of five, six people because they are trying to help me at the end I could do and I learned a lot. But this is the point. It's not so easy. Especially sometimes we need help and if you ask help, if you don't give up, you change everything for you and including for the people that is helping as well, but just make difference. I'm so proud of you and all the people like Vanana that tried to solve the problems. And I'd like to say thank you for all the other students that was helping was supporting us. The developers expect so amazing.
00:03:27.970 - 00:04:03.920, Speaker A: Exactly. Yes, the people try to help. I'm so proud of you as the other students, our developers, experts, especially Lucas. Oh nice. Yes, thank you everyone. And you can see that. Oh, I didn't present the pad yet.
00:04:03.920 - 00:04:52.714, Speaker A: You can see here that on this time in this last day, I ask for you to. I'd like to know more about you. So what's your occupation? What's your role? I'd like to know a bit more about my students. So, software engineer, public administration, security architect, full stack developer from Brazil, Gabrielle and Defy, web developer, project owner. We have a lot of different people here. It's amazing to know a bit more about you as well. Data analysis is so amazing.
00:04:52.714 - 00:05:30.870, Speaker A: You understand better what you can do now with the data. I hope so. Amazing. Yes, a lot of great people here. In some minutes you go to the presentation. I have a small presentation for you today. But before the presentation we must do the last exercise from yesterday because it's in the tasks.
00:05:30.870 - 00:06:18.760, Speaker A: And I add a new slide here because I'd like to give some tips for you as well. And I forgot to add it. Yes, I think my slides are updated. Wow. A lot of wow. Restaurant owner Melissa, where are you based? I'd like to have a dinner in your restaurant. So amazing.
00:06:18.760 - 00:07:08.520, Speaker A: Yes. You can stay here like filling this and I will do the presentation part. And then what I did, that's not showing everything. And then we are going to the exercise from yesterday. We are finishing the exercises functions. Here we are session number ten last day. So today I'm talking about connecting the world using the chain link platform.
00:07:08.520 - 00:08:09.354, Speaker A: We did a lot of things in the hands on part, but I'd like to tell a bit more about some services that we didn't practice. The pad is here. You are right over there. And let's learn what is proof of reserve. The PR, the idea of proof of reserving is to get on chain proof of any asset that you'd like to use, for example in a true collateralization. And this can be used like to reduce the song based risks in automated and true basic auditors, or to improve the transparency for the users or to prevent the system fails in Defi some of the goals of this. So proof of reserve is so important on Defi how this is working.
00:08:09.354 - 00:09:09.790, Speaker A: You can get data inside your smart contract from external sources or any on chain based asset backet that is based by off chain or cross chain reserves. And then this can provide basement context with the information that you need to calculate the true collateralization. And this is important like how the Chainlink services operated by a centralized network of nodes. Oh, I must think they helped. Melissa, did you know that we made the last smart con, the chain link conference last year in Barcelona? I was there in two times in June and October. Let's see if I go this year to Barcelona, I will let you know and come back to the proof of reserves. This is like the idea.
00:09:09.790 - 00:10:46.326, Speaker A: Imagine especially when we talk about banks, imagine that we have some institution over there with the off chain reserves and then we have the Chainlink network with a lot of nodes that go over there and check the reserve, check the balance, get the consensus this information will be saved in a proof of reserve contact created by Chainlink. And you in your decentralized application, any of these contacts is your application can use this and can audit the reserves that are saved here and out the defy users. They can trust that this is good. If your application is checking this and doing some kind of guarantee related to this. And when we talk about proof of reserve, we can use this to gisted assets, circuit breakers, cross chain tokenization or new financial products that you can think about it more ideas. The cross chain assets that you can now you can do a part of this including using the cCAp. But if you'd like to only do a query, it would be better if you do this using the graph or using another proof of reserve.
00:10:46.326 - 00:11:34.710, Speaker A: It will be faster to you. And imagine about the rapid assets. I will show you an example related to this or fiat backed stable coins. We have a lot of stable coins that are backed by fiat or what I'm doing with you, I'm presenting to you not doing on this timing the proof of reserve for bitcoin. And this is our case that I'd like to present to you the proof of reserve of bitcoin. Because we have a lot of representation of bitcoin on Ethereum network. One of the famous is the WBC, the rapid bitcoin.
00:11:34.710 - 00:12:18.842, Speaker A: And this was made by bitgo. And what's happened, they have the bitcoins in their account and they create the WBC. That's the representation of bitcoin on the Ethereum network. And it means that they must have more bitcoins than they issued in the rapid bitcoin in the WBC. And I went in 2022, I went to their conference in the Bitigo Activist conference. Exactly to talk about this, how this is made with chaining proof of reserve. And this is the idea.
00:12:18.842 - 00:13:11.574, Speaker A: We have the bitcoin network and the balance that you be checked in a ten minutes interval. That's the block time of bitcoin, the medium. Then the chaining network is checking this and saving the information every time that the collateral, the amount of collateral changed it let's go. I have more in the other page. Then we have the content. The content, it's available to any of your smart context, any of your decentralized application. Query the proof of reserve and you can do something like okay, let's check if the reserve of bitcoins is greater than the rapid bitcoins usage.
00:13:11.574 - 00:14:17.566, Speaker A: If yes, okay, my application is good, if not, let's pause my application, let's wait and understand what happened. Something like that. And this has happened and it's your application that is checking this and don't allow the users do something wrong because they try to mint WBTC that is great than the bitcoin in reserve and come back here. You can see for example here when they minted the bitcoin, the rapid bitcoin. This will be returned here as well to the custodial wallet. And like I said before, this is supported by a network of the chain link nodes, the oracles. And we got this in ten and ten minutes, every ten minutes.
00:14:17.566 - 00:15:35.340, Speaker A: And when we have the deviation in the threshold we update them. And this can be used for example to protecting the applications and creating circuit breakers. Like I said before, you can't have more rapid bitcoins than the real bitcoin asset. And you can check this and this is some resources to you to study later. And I have another new the proof of reserve is not a new product. Like I told you before, I talk about this in 2022, but data streams, it's a new product launched last year and this is another protocol or service used on DeFi. And what is this? When you talk about the data feeds, this is the traditional push based oracles that they provide regular repeats when the price change some amount or in some periods of time.
00:15:35.340 - 00:16:37.006, Speaker A: So let's do a pause here and to understand better, if you go to data chain link and you got this, the deviation tree showed. So this will be updated only when the price changed at 0.5% or the heartbreak heart bit. To do this, it will be now only in 38 minutes. What happens? First you have an appetite, but imagine that you must have an appetite now on the second, and it's not any of these conditions, you have the data streams. So data streams are the pool based oracles. And this is a low lattice delivery of the market because you can verify on chain in a faster way in the exactly moment that you need that.
00:16:37.006 - 00:18:09.498, Speaker A: And you pay in a different way because you are paying to give that information, to retrieve that information in that time. So with data streams, the daps now have the on demand access to the high frequency market data that's backed by the decentralized and transparent infrastructure, that is the chaining data streams and to understand the difference as well of them. Imagine the push based the data feed is this, you have the data surface fetch with the Oracle network we have the delivery with the crypto signature and now we have the content like this is the one content for each pair. You have your application, the users are interacting with the application that get the information over there. Here in the pool based oracles we have something in a different way. The data sources are over there, the Oracle network as well. But is this when the user needs the information he will ask the information to the network that is fetching to him and then you save this inside the image content.
00:18:09.498 - 00:20:47.070, Speaker A: So if they use that is calling a function to update this. And another use that you can have is so interesting is to use the data streams with the chaining automation because you can automate the trade execution and including mitigate the front running. And here there are some high frequency and delivery with low lattice use cases like the perpetual futures option prediction markets. And this is how the architect of this we have the data providers, the decentralized Oracle network, the data dawn that signing the transactions for example to the automation dawn and then the application is getting the information when it's updated in certain conditions. And when we do the automation, the integration with the automation we can use the log trigger that we didn't use, we only use the customs logic but with the log trigger, the Ching link automation you get some information when you have a log of some ismatch content something happened in ismatch content and generate the log and then this log will be used to fetch the information in that timing. I know that this is a bit small but it's to understand this part using like chain link automation and data streams you have the data streams network, the part of chain, the part on chain that emit the event and then we have the check here, emit the event here, then we have the check log on the data streams part, then we have the check callback to your smart context, then we have the performance keep with that information. And here we can verify some report, automate something and for example emit a price update.
00:20:47.070 - 00:21:32.940, Speaker A: This is some idea and one great example that we have because data streams are not on testnets, are only on main net. I didn't because of this even the bitcoin proof of reserve it's on mainnet as well. So the main net services I didn't with you we are learning from zero. It's better to do this on Pesnet, but like GMX, it's one of the companies that is using this with the data streams and the automation to have the settle trade of this. And this is. I will talk about this in a few minutes. You know that I'm equilibrium now.
00:21:32.940 - 00:21:58.706, Speaker A: So this is the point that I like. This is the final overview of chaining. But we must do our last exercise. So it's time to go to. Let's refresh my other screen here to help you. And first to remember this. Thank you so much.
00:21:58.706 - 00:22:16.662, Speaker A: This is ten. All the sessions are here. You can review the sections. Scroll down. You have all the YouTube links over there. We are here now, live here. Remember that the bootcamp support is on discord.
00:22:16.662 - 00:22:41.170, Speaker A: We have the bootcamp channel yesterday. I know that including and others that has problems, we try to help to get them in our discord. The slides are here that I present to you. You can check out the slides. The task form. The deadline is January 3. One from this year.
00:22:41.170 - 00:23:01.478, Speaker A: Okay. The exercises are also on the GitHub updated. So if someone did amazing the pad. We know that this can happen. No problem. The exercises are here. And also after the boot camp, probably next month.
00:23:01.478 - 00:23:24.240, Speaker A: I will share with you a git book with a step by step. But this is for the future. Like for the on demand boot camp. For now we have the faucet. What I'm doing with the pads now. Not the faucet, the pads. I would do a document with our pads and share with the people that filled the form.
00:23:24.240 - 00:23:52.040, Speaker A: Because I'm sure that this is the people that are doing the exercise. And then you have the pad. Like I update how there's much content in the pad as well and share with you. Okay, and what more? Let's see if you need something to finish this today. We will be on Fuji today. And yes, you need a bit more. Let's send to you.
00:23:52.040 - 00:24:43.078, Speaker A: And when we finish the bootcamp, the way to get more tokens will be the normal faucet. We know that we create a high demand in the faucet now. And because of this it's better to not use this. But after the boot camp finish you can go to the normal pad and you'll be not so hard. Let's send a bit more now and also send some links. Here we are. And everything is here.
00:24:43.078 - 00:25:13.888, Speaker A: We are going now to the metamask Fuji. And then we are going to remix to do the last match content of our bootcamp. Let me get in the information. The other screen. Wait a minute, here we are. No, not yet. Almost there.
00:25:13.888 - 00:25:50.892, Speaker A: Here. So go to remix and connect it. Let's do it. I think mine is not 0.5 is good. Gabriel. We used to do the hackathon, two hackathons per year, so they are planning the next.
00:25:50.892 - 00:26:46.348, Speaker A: I don't know the date yet, but follow us and you will discover. I don't know what's the service when we ask this? Yes, this is probably something related to the chain link that we have. When you fetch information outside it is information. If you use like data streams, data feed, it is information. We save it in a chain link is much content like we saw the pairs of bitcoin, USD, something like that. But when we use other kinds of services that make sense only to your application, you be saved in your application like we saw in functions. I don't have this information now yet.
00:26:46.348 - 00:27:48.800, Speaker A: The idea is after everything, after January 31 we start to do this and probably we will let you know later. Okay, and here we are. I am in remix. Let's go to connect my wallet. Now I am connected and the last smart contest will be that I started to do with you yesterday and I didn't finish the weather for sure. And I have a goal with this quoted I am in the wrong workspace with a lot of tests, so let's create this. Now I think I must go up.
00:27:48.800 - 00:29:07.092, Speaker A: Yes, here and this is. I will explain what was wrong with my contact yesterday and how we solve this. And remember that you must deploy on Fuji and after deploy and to deploy use your function sub description id. This is the parameter a and then you can add here too. And don't forget to add the consumer on function, add the consumer and then yes, you can add here your name and your weather functions address. Let's do it. Weather functions.
00:29:07.092 - 00:30:20.980, Speaker A: Here I am. I must change because I create at least three boot camps and this is the first that I did with you. So I'm using this now. This is my subscription id has happened with me in the past. Sometimes we have so many files here that didn't have to do this. My recommendation downloaded the files and maybe you can try to even after refreshing it will be like trick if you go to that I did before like the inspect and application. But maybe this will clear your smart content.
00:30:20.980 - 00:30:42.236, Speaker A: So be careful. Download it before. Okay, can be this. Thank you for letting me know that I am not an injected provider. Thank you. You are paying attention. Yes, injected provider now.
00:30:42.236 - 00:31:32.644, Speaker A: Yes, this is my subscription id. Now I can deploy. Excellent. Here we are. This is mine. And this is one of the tasks from today in the task form, it's updated. And let's understand my content and what I change, because remember, we was trying to do this before yesterday.
00:31:32.644 - 00:32:01.810, Speaker A: This was my first contact yesterday. So what I change here, this is good now to manage the status of each request. So I'd like to know if the request is fulfilled, if it exists. And also always I'd like to get the response and the ahor. Remember that if I have a response, the ahor will be empty. And if I have an ahor, the response will be empty. Okay.
00:32:01.810 - 00:32:28.812, Speaker A: And here, hard coded to Fuji. This is the source code. Oh, I added this in the search code to format the temperature in graus centigrade. Okay, so you'll not be Fahrenheit. I delight to have everyone in the same. Sorry, the Fahrenheit guys. And you can change yours if you take this off.
00:32:28.812 - 00:33:22.360, Speaker A: Okay, then I created this series struct. And what my goal, you are creating your smart content. But my goal is that at the end of the boot camp, all of you are interacting with my content because I'd like to have inside my content, your series, your information to know my students around the world. So I created this city structure that this is the address, your address, your metamask address. The time is time that you did this. Because if you do in different days, you can have different temperatures, the name of the city and the temperature. So I create our way of these series structures to save out the series.
00:33:22.360 - 00:34:02.072, Speaker A: And when I have a city, I like to know the position of the city in that array. So I create an index to do this, a mapping name of the city, position in the array. And when I ask the city, I have a request id when I'm asking. So I must do. The other point is like, to have the hiquest id to that city. Oh, guys, I found the neighborhood here. Again, I should not use the city here.
00:34:02.072 - 00:34:29.120, Speaker A: I should use the index of the structure. Because if I have two cities, maybe I will update in a different one. Error. Let's maintain this way. But you know that maybe you update the series that someone else put before. I didn't test my content until now. You can see that we didn't talk about tests yet.
00:34:29.120 - 00:35:12.210, Speaker A: This will be like, not the beginner topic. So in the future, I must do another session related to tests. Okay, so let's go forward to description id, get temperature. So you are saying the city and then the city, you being the argument. This part is good. Like when I got the city I'm adding like an argument and using my source code and if you don't have my source code that I'm using, let's share this with you. Oh the hard part, to be human.
00:35:12.210 - 00:35:58.698, Speaker A: What is this? Is this, I think I'm right. Oh yes, I'm right. So hard to do this. So this is the link if you'd like to test my content before, thank you. Test it on playground. And here, let's try New York. And wow, it's cold over there.
00:35:58.698 - 00:36:40.670, Speaker A: Iupass by New York next week. Oh so cold. And here Sao Paul is not so hot. That's better for me. So it's working in this way. Here we are using Javascript, okay? And we are calling external website, external API using a Javascript code inside this solidit code. So when I came here, this is Javascript, but I'm calling this source code inside solidity.
00:36:40.670 - 00:38:30.268, Speaker A: And here we are, I'm putting the source code, the argument, so the argument is this. And then I'm sending the request to the functions network and updating this like the request with the city and creating the city struct with the message the time is time, the city, the timestamp is zero because I'd like to get when I receive the response and the temperature is empty because I receive in the response added the city over there and add the request in the list of requests. And this is then this is the point that I received the response from the functions network. And you can see that I have here I'm using the requests to put the fulfilled to update fulfilled response. Ehore I'm creating this AlC city here, that's the city related to the request and going to the city index of that city and update the temperature and the timestamp and emit the event. And I create some views here, first view to get the information from one city, second view to get the information of our cities. But this in some moment can happen that this will not work anymore because when I have so many cities this will be like a memory error and I cannot receive this information anymore.
00:38:30.268 - 00:39:28.152, Speaker A: So I created this list series that imagine that I have 100 series, I can get from one to ten, from 50 to 100, something like that. If you don't put the ink, I will use the last one and the stat must be greater than the stuff like that. Okay? And here is the series count. So I'm accounting how many series I have on this interval of index, creating an aux here and added a series on this array alcs to eternity. Let's go I did mine. I didn't add it to the functions yet. Probably.
00:39:28.152 - 00:39:57.920, Speaker A: Let's see. Two D ninety C. No, it's not this. So let's add now. Add consumer. This is the concept that you are deploying now. Okay.
00:39:57.920 - 00:41:06.472, Speaker A: We did this yesterday with other but we are doing now with this contact that you just deployed here. So let's approve it. So you need more avax did you try to get in the faucet? Where is the faucet? Okay, the faucet is here. IU added the password here and to the end of the classic and we have a lot of content. Great. Let's see. I think I added.
00:41:06.472 - 00:41:49.086, Speaker A: Okay, is here yesterday I told you to have like five links or five links is enough for you. I'm adding more because I ask to you interact with my content. So you are expanding how my link after. So I fund my subscription with a lot. You don't need to do this. Okay. 20 yes, it's this one.
00:41:49.086 - 00:42:18.890, Speaker A: Exactly. Go to your subscription from yesterday that you create yesterday. You can use the same subscription with more than one consumer. You can see that I have a lot of consumers here. Okay. And then over there you go to add consumer and use the address of your weather function that you create now. Thank you.
00:42:18.890 - 00:42:46.080, Speaker A: Thank you. Jets. And now I have enough to you. Great. So let's do it. First of all, let's see my list series. Oh, someone already.
00:42:46.080 - 00:43:13.978, Speaker A: Let's see. But it seems that this is the last request id. So we don't have the response yet. Let's wait the response of this. Yes, we have the response now. So this person add bn on my content. Nice.
00:43:13.978 - 00:44:07.240, Speaker A: Are you adding mine now? Now we are going to get temperature. You can do this. What do you need to change? Yes, probably in this part you must create a new structure. Imagine that in the way that I did here. Instead of use the CD struct create a new is Maui struct to return only what you like to have that is the timing and the temperature. Okay. So you must use the get temperature over there with some series your city for example.
00:44:07.240 - 00:45:32.168, Speaker A: Remember that you must add on this way not a space and et cetera. Okay. If you didn't add the ad funds page here, you can go to actions fund your subscription. So let's edit this for you as well. So if you need more funds, add a consumer it so adventures as well. It has less than prelim. Go to actions and advance.
00:45:32.168 - 00:46:11.850, Speaker A: Okay. And I think I didn't not mine yet it. Okay. Wow. I already have a lot. Amazing. I'm doing now it okay, it seems that's done.
00:46:11.850 - 00:47:01.480, Speaker A: So you have your request id. The last city is mining now. We already have a lot. Look at this. Yes, there are a vaccine defauce or I need to add more. And remember that I ask you to interact with my contract. So run the get imperator in south contract.
00:47:01.480 - 00:48:23.664, Speaker A: It means that you must use the at address and my address. Is this a last task goal? How's goal to have? How is students over there? And now I have these. You can see that I have some BN Bangalore. Hey, I was in Bangalore in the IT India. Did you met over there? Where to add my address? Okay, let's do this part. This is my address. So come back to remix at the address.
00:48:23.664 - 00:49:05.970, Speaker A: It is below deploy. So go here. Not deploy, go to IP address. Yes, you can see, you can see mine. You can see yours, you can see how be sure, Sylvia that you did is right. And let's see if my contract is my subscription is out of funds. No, I'm good.
00:49:05.970 - 00:49:47.780, Speaker A: And let's see if I have more. Now it seems. Yes, like this is mine. How we are now. I have this on mine now. I don't know where is this? Amsterdam, Campala, Toronto, Manila, Sao Paulo. Yes, I saw Vanana asking me when I go to Toronto.
00:49:47.780 - 00:50:09.844, Speaker A: I know that there happens some blockchain events on Canada, but I could not go yet. It's in my plans. Because this is a place that I never went before. Barcelona, Malta. Wow. Amazing. Kurkon.
00:50:09.844 - 00:50:29.730, Speaker A: I don't know where it is. Georgetown, Zurich, Derjong. I don't know. Naples. Oh, I will learn a lot of cities with you. Oh, ding dong is in. Ah, nice one.
00:50:29.730 - 00:51:16.430, Speaker A: So you can still do this. I may ask you a question. Here's in a few minutes, are you start the conclusion. Are you inviting Javier and Jeff to come here in a few minutes? Oh, interesting. Maybe I go over there. Nice one. Let's be in touch.
00:51:16.430 - 00:51:59.750, Speaker A: Wow. Let's see how we are now. Yes. I didn't cut an echo yet, but you can see that it's increasing, it's growing. And then next point that I'd like to share with you is like some opportunities. In a few minutes, I will add something related to chain link as well. But I'd like to add some opportunities to jobs, some generic opportunities.
00:51:59.750 - 00:52:42.270, Speaker A: For example, this is like, how can you work more? What you can do? I'm adding something here. Some job platforms to you. Not on this way. Let's change the format of this. For example, this is one. Let's put the right link. This is one that you can find some a lot of different over there.
00:52:42.270 - 00:53:29.340, Speaker A: Let's find another to you. This is the crypto job list. What more I have here? Um, there are some three or four that I like it. Yes. Let's get in a different way here. Not here. This is another platform that you can use the cryptocurrency jobs.
00:53:29.340 - 00:54:36.550, Speaker A: Let's get more. There are g's as well, cryptojobs. In a few minutes I will put directly the chain link. We have the web three car. Here's a lot of things for you and let's add the chain link in the first place. Imagine if I have my students here working with me later. Oh, it will be so amazing what I'm doing wrong.
00:54:36.550 - 00:55:21.010, Speaker A: Yes, it. So here you can go directly to the chain link jobs and check what we have. We have a lot of positions open. It is more for you. A lot of things. Engineering, capital markets, data analytics, assistant, finance. Go to marketing, marketing, operations, people, products, research, security.
00:55:21.010 - 00:56:54.570, Speaker A: So there are a lot of opportunities for you. I do not say that it's so easy like you have a long process to change chaining clubs and this is interesting because they really get the best people using this process. But I think this is the beginner's workshop. So I hope that you continue studying and prepare yourself to work your first later. It will be so amazing and let's see what more and how can you study more. I didn't prepare a slide specifically related to this, but I'd like to tell you that all the information that we have in the developer portal, the dev chain link is the best way to you to continue because I pointed a lot of material for you links and you can study a lot of it. There you have as much content examples of each services that I demo yesterday.
00:56:54.570 - 00:57:41.660, Speaker A: So I'm pretty sure that you have some stuff to study until the end of the year, including the bootcamp. I know that you must review something, understand better. And don't worry if after the boot camp you try to change some content and this is not working because probably you must have used some concept and understand better. This is normal in the boot camp you think that you have superpowers because you are copy and paste and do everything. But when we are not in the boot camp anymore and you try to do by yourself, sometimes it's hard. So this is normal. Keep going forward, keep studying because this make the difference.
00:57:41.660 - 00:58:16.120, Speaker A: The people that can't add like Elizabeth, probably be sure that we have the content. I'm not sharing my screen wait, be sure that you have the content over there. And with this content you can add it. I can edit the content again. Maybe someone updated. It seems not after ten days. The people used to maintain the pad in a good way.
00:58:16.120 - 00:59:23.570, Speaker A: Yes, the content is totally fine. So you must get the content open the content on. You must open the content on remix, then connect it to the injected provider and then use that address. Okay? Yes, I think you put a new slide at the end related to the tasks. And let's add the information here until I and I add the same at the end should be shared that you know this. Wow, 200 slides, guys. It's too much material to study.
00:59:23.570 - 01:00:01.980, Speaker A: Wow. Where is the end? Okay, it's here. So we are here the tasks until January 31 and I'm finishing the slides. And then I will invite Jeff and Javier to come here. So Jeff and Javier, you can be read on the backstage. And it is. Congratulations.
01:00:01.980 - 01:00:45.724, Speaker A: I'm so happy of you, what you learned. And I have two pages to tell what you learned. So you create your wallet in the first day, understand the blockchain fundamentals. Then the second day, you create your first match content, you understand the solidity fundamentals. And after this, in our day three, you create your token ERC 20, create the token shop and use the chain link data feeds. And the day four, you did a cross chain token transfer using chain link CCIP. So wait, that I forgot to put that.
01:00:45.724 - 01:01:32.904, Speaker A: This is a transfer token transfer. And let's go again. And also this was the day four, the day five, it was like take a break and you could understand a bit more. Talk with our community, understand the community. And then went to the second week. Second week, Monday, day six, we create our first NFT IRC 71 token. You understand how to store info on ipfs, we store the images the JSON, because we create the photo album.
01:01:32.904 - 01:02:15.432, Speaker A: And you learned how to rotate the photos in the album using the chain link automation. After this you mint. This was the other day. So this was the day seven, you mint a chain link data feed BTC priced NFT from one chain to another chain using CCIP. And then we was in the day eight. Day eight, we created the runners gaming using the chaining TVRF. And the day nine, yesterday we used the chain link functions to get weathering different cities and using arithmetic content.
01:02:15.432 - 01:03:19.790, Speaker A: And today, the 10th day, you learned how to connect the word use the chain link platform. Because I reviewed everything and it was a really great job and I'd like to invite you. We have the tasks form, but also we have a feedback tech for me to you to tell us how can we be better. I know that I must create more sessions to have sessions to solve it up. So when you be the next boot camp like it is next year, I'm planning to do once a year in January. Okay. And you have content to study out the year, but probably next year maybe are you doing three weeks and put more days in the middle with the community to have more days to solve? Dubbed can be good.
01:03:19.790 - 01:03:53.370, Speaker A: Yes. And probably the people are telling me. Wait a minute. Because the people are telling me that I must add this in the pad as well. And probably you must refresh these lights because I added after so related to jobs are here in the beginning. Not so beginning. Wait, let's add here.
01:03:53.370 - 01:04:31.664, Speaker A: Here is better. Okay. And I think that I'm ready to invite Jeff and Javier to the stage. Let's come here, Javier and Jeff. Because these two guys was with me all time in the background, helping me with all the tasks that I must do. And it was really amazing because to understand something relates to the bootcamp. Let's understand the history of this bootcamp.
01:04:31.664 - 01:05:10.880, Speaker A: Imagine that I was coming back to Brazil. I was in it. India, still in India. And I told my managers, hey, I'd like to do a two weeks boot camp in January. And the people are like, we are almost in the holidays mode because it was end of the year outside, especially me as well, but okay. And inside the chain link, we have a lot of people that can help and support, but we did this with a few people on this time. So it was Javier and Jeff with me all time.
01:05:10.880 - 01:05:34.730, Speaker A: Sophia, thank you so much that Sophia created all the stream structure to us, but these two guys was with me all the days doing tasks to the boot camp out the days. So thank you for so much, Javier and Jesh. And I'd like to you to introduce yourself to.
01:05:37.260 - 01:06:00.370, Speaker B: So. But for me, it's just words because you are the person that make this so wonderful, this experience, this boot camp. It's up to you. It's all for you guys. Amazing, the work that you did and. Yeah.
01:06:02.920 - 01:06:03.910, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:06:04.760 - 01:06:39.656, Speaker C: Yes, Javier is right. So you are our queen. You always did these crazy ideas and push us to give in, to do our best to make it happen with you. So thank you so much for being with us along these ten days to share with us that much knowledge. I'm pretty sure that we started 2024 in the best possible way. And we should say thank you for that. For you guys who doesn't know my name is Jeff Beltran.
01:06:39.656 - 01:07:21.100, Speaker C: I am manager in Brazil, also Portugal. I'm based in Brazil and brazilian, but I also support the global community and I've been working with Javier and so to make it happen for you guys. And it's a pleasure. It's a pleasure to make it, to see that much people engaged and participating with us. So it just make us even more confident that we are in the right way, that you guys want to have this content. So you can be sure that we're going to keep working hard along the year to keep providing the best for you guys. So wait the next episode.
01:07:22.800 - 01:08:05.544, Speaker A: Yes. And guys, one of you, could you open our links related to. I'm putting the padline 2009, the links related to the community advocates and developer experts to talk about them. Can you share your screen with any of you? Yes. The boot camp went so fast. Thank you. And someone in the middle was over there asking related to how long you'll be the boot camp available.
01:08:05.544 - 01:08:39.956, Speaker A: The videos will be here at least at the end of the year. And thank you so much. A lot of amazing comments. Remember that use your hashtag chain link bootcamp four. This is our hashtag Oyad. Here you can sharing the social media, everything that you did. And yes, Javier is here.
01:08:39.956 - 01:08:42.070, Speaker A: Talk about them, Javier, please.
01:08:43.000 - 01:09:18.108, Speaker B: Yes, this is a big opportunity for you. If you want to get involved more in the community of Chainlink, you can become a Chainlink advocate. Community advocates are really passionate about blockchain technology and oracles and smart contracts and things like that. And yeah, you're able to apply for being an advocate. We have advocates all around the world. We have advocates in Germany, USA, yeah, Brazil. A lot of people in Brazil.
01:09:18.108 - 01:10:07.328, Speaker B: We have advocates in Latam, in Peru, in Colombia also. Yeah, it's a big opportunity to connect with another people and create your local community. Related with blockchain technologies. I was an advocate for two years and it was a great experience for me to be part of this program and helped me a lot to connect with a lot of people in the industry and put me in this situation and that I had the chance to be part of a company in web three. And yeah, I'm part of changing labs right now. I'm part of changing labs for two years right now. Yeah.
01:10:07.328 - 01:10:46.348, Speaker B: And the other thing that I want to share with you is the developer expert program. This is similar to the community advocates, but this is more for developers. And yes, you have a lot of benefits because you can connect with people from chaining labs. And I don't know if you have some project or you have your startup or you want to build things, something. You can connect with people from chain labs, you can connect with Seoul every week. I don't know. We have weekly calls with the team.
01:10:46.434 - 01:10:50.590, Speaker A: Yes, we have calls. I don't know the frenzy, but we have calls with them.
01:10:52.320 - 01:11:28.830, Speaker B: Yeah. And we have developer experts for all around the world, like we had here, Lucas or Santiago or Gilbert that participated in our sessions of the bootcamp. We had Gilbert from Chile, Mexico, United States, France, India and all around the world. I invite you to participate. The only thing you have to do is to put click here in become developer expert and you have the chance to be one of these.
01:11:30.480 - 01:11:45.360, Speaker A: I added the links in the beginning of the pad as well. So the links are here. Chaining community advocate. Oh, let's change the layout here. Chain link Comment Advocate chain link developer expects.
01:11:47.140 - 01:12:14.756, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Well, in case you don't know me, I'm Javier Salomon. I'm the community manager for LATAM and for the spanish speaking community. And I have some words for you. This is the end of this channeling bootcamp 2024. I just want to say how amazing it has been to see the progress of everyone here. It's been a great journey.
01:12:14.756 - 01:12:57.990, Speaker B: I'm super excited about everything we have learned and done together. I hope you all had as much fun as we did and that this is just the beginning of your journey with us. I hope. I'm looking forward to see you more in our community getting involved and building amazing things together. I'm really happy about the progress you have made in this boot camp. We have grown a lot as a group and individually. Please stay connect with us in web three.
01:12:57.990 - 01:13:28.400, Speaker B: Web three. World community is everything. And follow us in social media for the lattice news, future events, more workshops, hackathons. Remember, hackathons are a great way to learn and grow. We have experience. Like Solange, you have great experience in Hackathon. I thought you won the Denver Hackathon.
01:13:29.620 - 01:14:19.680, Speaker A: Yes, now I'm not a hacker anymore like I'm in the other side. But I started to participate in Hackathon in 2018. My first hackathon in 2018, it was it Buenos Aires, and in 2019 I own my first two hackathons. It was it in New York when I creating arbitrage bot to decentralized exchanges. And then I won another prize in it, Berlin in I think August like that. And the beginning of 2019 I won a prize in ity Denver doing some application to the government of Colorado. And then I changed to the other side and I was not a hacker anymore.
01:14:21.380 - 01:14:50.652, Speaker B: I remember your experience. It was amazing. And yes, just please send a message in the chat to express our grateful to Saul because she did a lot for us. And yeah, thank you. And yeah, thank you all for this fantastic bootcamp. Let's keep in touch and keep building great things together. Congratulations for your work.
01:14:50.652 - 01:14:54.750, Speaker B: And yes, let's continue building things.
01:14:55.680 - 01:15:16.452, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you so much, everyone. I think it's this. We are finishing our ten days boot camp. And thank you. I really hope to see some messages for you in social media. You know that I'm, like, sharing out of them as well.
01:15:16.452 - 01:15:41.736, Speaker A: I'm doing a retweet. I'm trying to share everything that I found it. And you know that I'm here now, but I'm starting to travel again. I travel all the year. So if some event is happening in your city, maybe I will be over there. Come to me and tell me that he was in the boot camp. I love hugs.
01:15:41.736 - 01:15:55.480, Speaker A: You can give me a hug. And I'd like to know what is related to your boot camp after this. Tell your history to us. Okay, bye, everyone. Thank you. Bye.
