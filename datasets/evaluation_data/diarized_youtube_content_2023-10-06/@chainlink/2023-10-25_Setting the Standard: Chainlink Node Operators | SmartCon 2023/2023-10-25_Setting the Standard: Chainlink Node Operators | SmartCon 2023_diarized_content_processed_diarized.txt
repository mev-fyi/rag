00:00:00.570 - 00:00:39.782, Speaker A: Us with node operators, the people who are running the software that makes Chainlink possible, from price feeds to cross chain to automation. These are the folks who allow the space and defi to run today. So without further ado, please, guys, come on stage. Thank you. Perfect. All right, thank you all. So let's start with some introductions going from on this side.
00:00:39.782 - 00:00:45.050, Speaker A: Basically, tell us more about what you guys do and what your companies do in a few words.
00:00:45.200 - 00:00:58.990, Speaker B: Hi, everybody. My name is Eric Carlson. I'm a partner with a business called Rhino. Thank you very much. One person. We're a chain link node operator, and we also run infrastructure for a large number of l ones in the ecosystems.
00:00:59.890 - 00:01:19.080, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Kubila Chilik. I'm the CEO of Matrix Link. We are a verified chain link node operator. We run custom chain link solutions, we create custom chain link solutions. We maintain nodes for a few projects, we run infrastructure for projects, and we mainly focus on building chain link stuff.
00:01:20.970 - 00:01:40.890, Speaker D: I'm Pat McNabb, one of the co founders and CEO of Peer Two. We are a blockchain infrastructure company. Been eagerly supporting the chainlink network for a few years now, and it's been exciting to see that evolve, but also focused on Ethereum staking and validation across a bunch of other networks.
00:01:41.550 - 00:01:56.990, Speaker E: I'm Peter from Maverick. I'm the CFO nowadays of Chainlayer. We're a chainlink node operator, staking service provider, and we run a bunch of Ethereum validators. And we've been a chainlink node operator since almost the beginning.
00:01:58.290 - 00:02:10.870, Speaker F: I'm Zayle Reeves, founder of Northwest Nodes. So we are probably one of the newest node operators on the Chainlink ecosystem, and that is our focus at this time. And, yeah, we're based out of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
00:02:11.370 - 00:02:22.410, Speaker A: Perfect. I think some of you joined us a few years ago, some of you joined us more recently. Maybe you can tell us more about what inspired you to become Chenneknode operators.
00:02:24.590 - 00:02:56.740, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, for us, we won the last iteration of the Oracle Olympics, and the biggest inspiration for us was the Oracle Olympics and the very first smartcon that was ran where we kind of realized we'd been in the ecosystem for quite a while, big supporters. And we realized that there was actually an avenue for kind of more community members like us to actually get involved and have that potential to get onboarded onto Chainlink. So that was really our story, but it's been different for everybody, and we're just very excited to be here.
00:02:57.990 - 00:03:35.780, Speaker E: I think you'd like to add that we were already pretty excited about it because it was the first project that was really recognizing the need for putting data on chain, which back then was something that was in essence a really big thing, but not really actual yet because there were no users yet. In that sense, it was really visionary and we're really happy to join as one of the first and see the growth through all the networks and all the whole ecosystem kind of thing. But yeah, kind of. The past years have proven how big the need for data on chain really is and really excited about what's coming next. Basically.
00:03:37.990 - 00:04:09.100, Speaker C: We'Ve been community members since 2017 turned community node operators in 21. We've helped create the gains network, custom decentralized Oracle network, which rolled us into becoming verified Chainlink node operators and just building stuff like we mainly do, custom solutions. So we've been an OG chain link only node operator. We've been recently just expanding in the space, building real estate oracles and utilizing Chainlink technology.
00:04:11.150 - 00:04:35.640, Speaker B: Yeah, I think our story is very similar to these guys. We're working with a lot of decentralized Oracle networks that were really subpar, honestly, early on, and we ended up getting a great introduction through some networking and other types of things that got us involved within Chainlink, and we've just been just over impressed with the quality of the services that we're able to provide through the infrastructure that exists. So it's been great. Yeah.
00:04:36.490 - 00:04:37.880, Speaker A: Patrick, you want?
00:04:39.050 - 00:05:39.290, Speaker D: Not a great deal to add, but I guess early on seeing a lot of the visionary and future use cases of smart contracts, especially those that affected the real world. Sergey always went on about the crop insurance smart contracts, for example. And around those early days, we were investigating agricultural insurance smart contracts and being a part of a network that facilitated the expansion of data sets and applications was something that certainly inspired us to join the group. And it's fantastic to have just continued to see that grow. And it does still feel like we're right at the very beginning, so eagerly looking forward to what the next sort of 510 years of use cases. And if we end up in that world, or when we end up in that world of seeing those agricultural smart contracts that Sergey always spoke about in the earlier presentations.
00:05:40.270 - 00:06:41.710, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of the folks on this stage actually joined early and helped us build to where we are today. Meaning it wasn't only about running the infrastructure, it was also about giving feedback, helping us drive directions. I still remember many of you joining, still remember when you guys joined ETH USD when it was 2019, maybe back in the very early days, and we always got feedback we always got input on how to actually grow and scale, and now we are here today. And I think that was really team effort with node operators helping us build throughout these years. Now, let's discuss a bit more around the difference between running a channel link node and running other software. Many of you folks are doing validation on blockchain networks. What's the main difference between validating state and feeding data or feeding automation when you're running a chain link node?
00:06:43.170 - 00:07:12.502, Speaker E: I can have a go at that. I think for us, in the end, software is software. I think we kind of think we specialized in running software. I think you could give us any software you would want to run. Twenty four seven, and we'll be able to do it. That said, the devil's in the details. So the big difference between validating networks and something like chain link today would be with regards to staking and actually being able to lose your own money or other people's money.
00:07:12.502 - 00:08:06.550, Speaker E: Where chainlink, you secure value in a different way. So the way we secure value is defi applications using the data we are providing, which can sometimes be a bit harder to see, I guess, because there's no direct relation between the things you do and the value you secure. But it's equally important, and we treat it the same in the sense, I think another thing that I'd like to call out is the Chainlink development team, which is really great. I think Chainlink can pride themselves on having one of the best development teams in the world, and that makes a huge difference as well. The software is constantly improving. It's kind of easy to run, to keep running, and Chainlink listens to feedback, and that's really valuable.
00:08:08.090 - 00:08:09.798, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:08:09.964 - 00:09:07.066, Speaker F: I was just going to say, yeah, and it's always been with the constant reiterations and there's new products like CCIP and things like this coming out. That's a whole new stream of logs and stream of data that's going to be coming in through your nodes. And so you always have to make sure that you understand what the purpose of all this stuff is so that you can monitor it properly. And it's just always ever evolving. Blockchains, they do one thing and they do it quite well, but as long as you're keeping track of what's being done by those blockchains, then you've really got it covered. Whereas now, with a chainlink node, you're always going to need to, need to monitor your data feeds, your external adapters, the nodes themselves, the blockchain nodes. So there's just a lot more complication going on and just a lot more need to be on top of every little aspect of it to ensure that, because if we're redundant and we're performant, then we can ensure that the whole network stays in the immaculate state that it's been for five years at this point.
00:09:07.168 - 00:09:32.398, Speaker B: Right. Plus dependencies on third parties from an exchange perspective, and the bridge updaters and kind of, there's a lot of integration there that has to come together to be able to produce some valid on chain data. So, yeah, it's a lot more moving parts, I think was kind of the other area. So if a blockchain node is running, it's kind of running and it's producing, but in this sense, you have three or four different actors that are playing roles that all need to be monitored and watched.
00:09:32.414 - 00:09:33.300, Speaker A: Like we said.
00:09:35.210 - 00:10:13.678, Speaker D: I think a unique component is you're less so nowadays, but definitely back when it was kicking off, you're a gas guzzler, so you learn about the networks and congestion pretty firsthand. And that's one unique insight that I think a lot of people operating full nodes in different capacities don't really get the full extent of how a network feels and looks from a transaction perspective. So that's certainly been a great component to learn about when operating a chainlink node.
00:10:13.854 - 00:10:35.830, Speaker C: I mean, the main difference from a financial perspective is that with traditional validators, you only secure one chain or a set of nodes, but with chain link, it's so widespread across all of the DFI applications and like 15 chains and all the services. So you contribute in a way broader perspective in the whole DFI ecosystem.
00:10:37.550 - 00:11:19.238, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think there is a lot of learning experiences, for sure. Right. And another operator going through running chainlink actually goes through learning about a lot of systems, right. From data to multiple chains, the monitoring has to be on point. Maybe you guys can tell us a bit more about what were really the secrets, the main things which allowed you to keep performing and ensuring urinode is always up. Urinode is always running through all the crazy times the industry has gone on, from the gas spikes on Ethereum to the airdrops NFTs, which were spiking everything.
00:11:19.238 - 00:11:23.880, Speaker A: Also tell us a bit more about how you kept it running throughout all these years.
00:11:25.450 - 00:12:17.080, Speaker F: I mean, for us it's a constant learning and you run into new situations and that gives you the ammo and the ideas that you need to change your monitoring and observing. But really it's just trying to keep track of everything. We attach lots of monitors to just about every aspect of what we do. And so we know where the parameters and thresholds are, where something needs to get looked at, and then it's just a matter of looking at. I mean, the great thing about the chainlink software is it's very good at telling you exactly what is happening. So if you take the time to actually dig through the logs and to understand exactly what's going on, then you can troubleshoot quite quickly and quite easily, and then you understand where to set your thresholds and what you actually need to monitor for. And then that allows you to be a little bit hands off once in a while.
00:12:19.690 - 00:12:46.462, Speaker E: I'd like to add two things there. I think. The first is not sleep. That's proven to be a very successful way of running a chainlink node, which is not because of the Chainlink software, but mainly because of the ecosystem that we're living in. And the second thing I think is very pointed, is the community. What I really like about Chainlink, I've always liked about it, is the great community we have. So all the node operators kind of work together with the Chainlink team to keep everything up and running.
00:12:46.462 - 00:13:01.110, Speaker E: And even if your node might be doing something not really good, chances are that a fellow node operator is going to reach out to you and tell you like, hey, you should look at this, or can we help you with something like that? And I guess the flask is enough.
00:13:01.180 - 00:13:32.750, Speaker C: Yes, I mean, the whole Chainlink community is about being cooperative. We've now been doing monthly calls with close to all of the node operators and sharing insights and knowledge with each other, and trying to create new tooling and give feedback to chainlink to feature requests. So if the whole community of node operators just continues to work together as we are now, we can see the ecosystem evolve more rapidly.
00:13:35.090 - 00:13:37.374, Speaker A: Perfect. Go ahead.
00:13:37.412 - 00:14:18.846, Speaker F: Yeah, I was also just going to say that I think that the best part about the node operator community, and really the chain link community at large, is that we all understand that there is one overarching goal of this whole process, and that is to keep truth accurate uptime, 100%, all the time. And so if we all understand that that is the goal, then we all understand that we can just help each other. And it doesn't have to be this hyper competitive, full greed, trying to get every little bit better than the next guy, right? As long as all our nodes and we can help each other and we're all improving, then the network's improving and we have a better service for the clients and the people who use it. So it's a really refreshing place to be.
00:14:19.028 - 00:14:19.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:19.348 - 00:14:37.400, Speaker B: And even as OCR gets more mature and those types of things, I think we're starting to apply that to CCIP and other types of areas that maybe that monitoring doesn't exist yet, but we're finding different ways to do that and providing feedback. And that's really good to take that, I guess that even if for us are just less than two years, but take that experience and apply it to a whole new product set, it's cool.
00:14:38.010 - 00:15:31.526, Speaker A: Yeah. I think this alignment has always been critical for us since the very early days, actually, the mentality was always, how do we grow? Not how do we compete on this small pie, but how do we actually grow? And that was since the days we had two protocols using Chainlink to the days we are at today, where 2000 protocols are using on a daily basis. Right. And that mentality is node operators embraced it as how do we get more protocols, more usage, more chains? How do we grow the system? Because if we all grow, we all benefit, and the whole industry as a whole benefits. And I think that's been critical, that we have this hyper competitive mindset, which a lot of networks have. Yeah, perfect. Now tell us a bit more about your experience over the last several years.
00:15:31.526 - 00:15:40.230, Speaker A: Right. We've seen many things over the last years. How do you think things have changed since the day you started as a node operator?
00:15:40.310 - 00:15:41.894, Speaker B: That seems like that's directed at Peter.
00:15:42.022 - 00:15:48.780, Speaker A: Oh, that's directed. The last six months is already like 20 crazy things happening. Right.
00:15:50.110 - 00:16:37.770, Speaker E: I mean, I can go first for sure. What a question. I think change is the new constant in not just our operation, not just in the ecosystem, but maybe in the world with COVID we've seen. Well, I don't want to get into the archival thing, but the world at large is changing so rapidly that all you can do is just try to keep up with all the change, with everything. I personally enjoy that a lot, and I think our team really enjoys that a lot. There's nothing like waking up in the morning and not knowing what you're going to do the rest of the day. And I think that's kind of been the same for years.
00:16:37.770 - 00:16:54.020, Speaker E: So we've went from a direct request to flux monitor to OCR, and I loved every step of it. And it's constantly. Yeah, as long as we're doing that, I'm happy.
00:16:55.270 - 00:17:32.160, Speaker C: Yeah. The role chainlink has been playing in the whole defi ecosystem and bringing it up step by step has been pretty vital, because without Chainlink, we wouldn't have the defi ecosystem we have today. So as a community member and as a node operator, it's great to see how we went from the price feeds to automation, VRF, CCIP functions, and now the low latency oracles. So seeing how Chainlink essentially flaps its wings and becomes a more central part of the whole of Webtree is really great to see happen in real time.
00:17:35.250 - 00:17:40.080, Speaker A: What are some of the next big things coming up you're most excited about?
00:17:43.620 - 00:18:29.360, Speaker D: Pretty keen to see a bunch of innovative CCIP apps get rolled out. Certainly there's a lot of innovation that that can open up, and that I'm aware a lot of teams are building at the moment that over the next one, two years will be in production. So seeing what that does for things like DeFi liquidity, or seeing what that does for gaming in the industry as well, I think we're going to look like a very different industry in two to three years time due to some of the unlocks that Chainlink's bringing to the table through CCIP and functions and everything else. So excited to keep abreast of that and see how it evolves.
00:18:30.500 - 00:19:01.630, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't if know you guys have heard, but there was a little bit of a regulation issue in the United States. So I think that over the next. I don't know, I think it's pretty four to eight years. But I think Chainlink plays a large role in that, in terms of driving towards some sort of finality there. I think it creates CCIP, creates additional trust, it creates avenues towards some sort of answer, and I think that's an extremely positive thing. So to play a small role in that, I think that's really exciting for us.
00:19:02.080 - 00:19:26.180, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. CCIP was like the missing piece of the puzzle that essentially enables everything and starts a scale of hypergrowth. So having that cross chain governance modules, having those cross chain Dexes and thefi that can enter with their bank chains is really like kickstarting a new era of chainlink, essentially, and Defi as a whole.
00:19:26.250 - 00:19:26.980, Speaker B: Agreed.
00:19:27.640 - 00:20:22.020, Speaker F: Yeah. And I mean, really just bringing everything together where I think there was a grand vision of crypto right from the beginning of kind of maybe eating traditional financial systems. And there was a period for kind of the last few years, up until recently, where no one was really sure whether there would be the crypto world and then the rest of the world, and if these things would ever mix in any real shape or form. But I think that if you're a regulator or if you're a large institution, you can see that there is actually a way to do this, to make it secure and to make it reliable. So that opens up just a floodgate of possibilities for everyone. And like Patrick said, it's going to be way different in five years than it is today. And it's amazing to just kind of play our little part and just to be able to see that actually grow.
00:20:22.020 - 00:20:37.752, Speaker F: Because I think for a lot of people on this stage and probably a lot of people in the audience, that's what we are more interested in, is something that actually brings real value to the world and doesn't just exist in its own little niche somewhere. So that's what I'm most excited about.
00:20:37.806 - 00:20:38.410, Speaker B: Right?
00:20:39.100 - 00:21:10.452, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a critical part with CCIP. Our industry has been living in silo for a long time, and there are two goals with CCIP. First one is break the silos within the crypto industry, which is very important, right? Because if you're not breaking the silos, people are using unsafe solutions or their liquidity is siloed. So that's one thing. And the second thing is actually connect the crypto world to the outside world. And that's what really brings us to adoption. That's what really moves the industry forward.
00:21:10.452 - 00:21:59.268, Speaker A: That's why it really makes crypto go mainstream. That's the dreams people were talking about a few years ago, which you actually have an avenue to make happen now, because now people are tokenizing stuff. Once they tokenize these assets, these real world assets, they realize, oh, okay, my real world asset is on one chain, how do I get it on the other chain? And the folks who do that, institutions have very high security standards. They're not going to use a random solution, they're going to use something like CCIP, right. And that's, I think, really the opportunity for all of us on stage today. In the next five years, we might actually witness the adoption we've been dreaming about for the last five years, which is very exciting for all of us. Tell me more about how node operators are actually preparing for this future.
00:21:59.268 - 00:22:13.210, Speaker A: So for CCIP, for instance, you need to run the software of multiple blockchains, right? How do you scale your infrastructure to be able to support ten, 5000 chains in the future?
00:22:15.740 - 00:22:47.190, Speaker F: Yeah, for us, we've understood that this was the end goal from the beginning. So we've always designed our systems with scalability in mind. And whether it be a lot of horizontal scaling and having more and more blockchains, or whether you need to scale vertically and just have a ton of throughput on one area, we've made sure that right at the beginning that we're ready for all that. So bring on more chains, bring on the bank chains, we're ready. And I'm sure all these guys are as well.
00:22:47.880 - 00:23:31.280, Speaker E: Yeah, I think likewise, you can't build infrastructure like this if you don't keep those things in mind. So both on horizontal and vertical scaling, we're ready for basically anything you throw at us. That's a challenge. Exactly. And on the security side, I think one of the things that we've always believed in is physical security as well. So we personally run everything in a Dc that's behind lock and bars, which we think is a good addition to making things really secure. Whenever real banking chains are coming in, they don't want you to run their app in Google Cloud, for example.
00:23:31.280 - 00:23:39.590, Speaker E: At least I'm expecting them not to. So, yeah, also on that level, I think we're ready to play game.
00:23:40.280 - 00:24:07.710, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we chainlink node operators always align with the vision of Chainlink, of being like the industry standard and being on hundreds and thousands of chains, facilitating CCIP, running price feeds, running all the chainlink services. So we already had that in mind when we became node operators. So using that knowledge, we've built our systems to scale horizontally and grow with chaining together.
00:24:10.320 - 00:25:03.070, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the technical considerations are certainly extremely important, both from a redundancy perspective and security. It'll be interesting to see what the demands of these entities, these mythical entities, these banks are going to be with respect to things like compliance. I think we've operated in an enjoyably so wild west to many respects over the last five years. And things like ISO and SOC and certain standards of operating that are very normal for a lot of financial services industry businesses are likely to start to become relevant for groups like us that are operating on the edge. So that's probably something that's going to become more relevant. If I was to hazard a guess.
00:25:04.480 - 00:25:15.590, Speaker B: That'S a good question too. And what part of that is actually under, say, an isms? Is it each individual operator? Is it the solution? And I think those are good questions that are going to have to be answered too.
00:25:17.240 - 00:25:19.652, Speaker D: And we'll be together to figure it all out.
00:25:19.706 - 00:25:21.750, Speaker B: Yeah, on slack. That's right.
00:25:23.320 - 00:25:38.916, Speaker A: Perfect. Well, we're probably at the last question for any aspiring node operator who is looking to start running nodes, providing data, et cetera, what would be some advice you can give them to start their journey?
00:25:39.028 - 00:26:26.600, Speaker C: Well, that's a good one. That's actually how we became verified node operators. We started out in the discord and just help as many developers as you can to chain link their Sundays project and go on Testnet. Try to get on Mainnet. If you can build a track record with clients you've interacted with, and you can help them facilitate their data transactions on Mainnet, like us, you can grow and participate in custom decentralized Oracle network. Create real custom solutions like a real estate oracle for example. And then with your track record, Chainlink will notice, they will see the work you put in and all you need is a video call to essentially flow into the node operator community and start operating the OCR feeds.
00:26:28.140 - 00:26:56.450, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean we had a pretty similar entrance. We participated in the Oracle Olympics and that was what got us to where we are. But before that we were doing the same things. We tried to really support the hackathons is obviously a huge thing to do. Those guys are going to be busy building their projects. So if they have a node they can plug into, that's going to be very good for them and then you can help along with that as well. And who knows where that might end up and really just being available.
00:26:56.450 - 00:27:33.150, Speaker F: And the nice thing about when you're kind of starting off on some of these testnets and these hackathon style projects is that gives you a chance to actually battle test your nodes a little bit as well. And then you'll realize like, oh, we need to monitor this, we need to monitor that. And then when the day comes and you get a chance to compete in the Oracle Olympics, or you just get the call itself, then you're very well prepared. And like Kublais said, there's lots of custom dawns that are getting spun up for various reasons. And yeah, if you can set yourself apart and make yourself available, then I'm sure people will be inviting you into those as well.
00:27:33.920 - 00:28:10.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I get that question also about when people want to start different validators on different types of chains. And I always also give them the advice that running a node is one thing, but running nodes at 24 365 is a totally different thing. And when you don't really have an exit plan, you're not like thinking this is a five year thing, this is a 25 or a 30 or a 50 year type of obligation. It's nothing not to be taken lightly either. And so I would say on the technical side it's about automation and redundancy and really strong architecture. Start with something small and build those things out and make sure that it's something that you really want to be able to do for a very long time.
00:28:11.200 - 00:28:12.552, Speaker E: Yeah, take it seriously.
00:28:12.616 - 00:28:27.920, Speaker B: Take it seriously, because it is a real commitment. I'm sure there's pager duty. Everybody has their phone on stage. And no matter what, even if you're not on call, you're on call, right. It's a real commitment 24/7 it is. No matter what your role is, right?
00:28:27.990 - 00:28:32.460, Speaker A: Yeah. It's actually very good advice. If you want to be another operator.
00:28:32.620 - 00:28:33.584, Speaker B: Make sure you want to be.
00:28:33.622 - 00:28:34.770, Speaker A: Make sure you want to be.
00:28:35.940 - 00:28:41.364, Speaker C: You got to be dedicated, and you need to be persistent, and then it just all falls together.
00:28:41.482 - 00:28:55.000, Speaker A: That's right. Fully agree. And I think you guys have been through the whole experience and you know what it entails, right? So it's tough, but it's worth it. Well, sure. Perfect. Any last word, guys? Anything else to close this panel?
00:28:57.180 - 00:29:38.276, Speaker F: I mean, I'd just love to thank you guys for putting on another great event. Thanks for building all this awesome software that we run and really pushing this whole ecosystem forward. I couldn't imagine what the state of crypto would be without chainlink these days. I guess that eventually a good solution would arise, but it'd just be hacks everywhere, and then Defi couldn't even get off the ground, so I couldn't imagine the world any other way now. Just want to say thanks for giving us the chance to even prove ourselves as node operators as well. And the way that you guys run things has been fantastic.
00:29:38.388 - 00:29:39.880, Speaker C: We're all in this together, right?
00:29:39.950 - 00:29:55.736, Speaker A: Yeah, we're all in this together. And I think you guys can all be super proud of what you've achieved together in the last few years, because this would not be possible without you guys either. So thank you. And I think we're all growing Defi and growing the space together, and that's really for the best of everyone. So thank you very much.
00:29:55.758 - 00:29:56.152, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:29:56.206 - 00:29:56.660, Speaker E: Thanks, Joe.
