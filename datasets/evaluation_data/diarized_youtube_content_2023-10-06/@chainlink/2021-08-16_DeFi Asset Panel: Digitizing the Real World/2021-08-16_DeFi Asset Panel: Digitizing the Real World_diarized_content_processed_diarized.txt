00:00:05.530 - 00:00:55.166, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. My name is David. I'm on the ecosystem team here at Chainlink. And today we're joined by a gray panel who are each leading projects that are focused on building new ways for us to bring real world assets into the Defi ecosystem in order to provide more options and access for people around the world. So today we're joined by Ash Morgan, who's the co founder of Mycelium Ray. Fernando Verbunin, who's the co founder of Curio invest Justin Snap, CTO and co founder of Terexa, and Pascal Telerita, who's the CEO and founder of Jarvis. So, as you can see, we have a great panel here to talk about this, and I want to start by diving into the types of synthetic assets that each of you is focusing on.
00:00:55.166 - 00:01:22.470, Speaker A: So many people are familiar with synthetic assets, such as stock tokens or crypto derivatives, but each of you on this panel is really pushing the limits of these and other types of assets that can be tokenized and what can be done with these types of synthetic assets. So I want to start with you, Ash. Could you talk a bit about your vision for what you're building and what types of synthetic assets you're creating?
00:01:23.290 - 00:02:31.626, Speaker B: Thanks, David. Yeah, really glad to be here as well. It's awesome to see where Chainlink's got to. They're absolute monsters in the best possible way. Powerhouses of the space, and they're building some key infrastructure that's going to power our application and I think quite a few others in the future. Yeah, where we've got to with Tracer and where we're building is a product suite and offering that allows their users to actually manage risk in the most sophisticated way possible to date. To your question at the beginning about, and the statement around there being obviously quite a familiarity with this product and with these products, I would sort of disagree with that to the extent that of the 750,000 active users on Ethereum, a tiny subset of them are using these synthetic asset products and crypto derivatives.
00:02:31.626 - 00:03:41.010, Speaker B: So I think the big challenge that we're looking to solve for here is to put tools and derivatives that enable people to hedge their risk exposure right in the hands of the everyday user, the Defi power user, and then bridging the gap and putting it right into the hands of individuals, and then from there, small businesses. Just the same way that many big institutions use derivatives to manage the risks that they're exposed to. I think the trend around stocks and commodities being traded on blockchains, it's interesting, but it's not really a product market fit just as of yet. The owners of those markets exist, and they still exist, and they will exist for quite some time. Nasdaq trades on a daily average of about 200 billion on their stocks alone. And on a commodity front, on the gold front, the CME does 46 billion a day on gold futures. So the reality is the market hasn't even begun.
00:03:41.010 - 00:04:43.686, Speaker B: The first picks and shovels haven't even arrived. They're being manufactured, they're getting shipped in cough cough chain link. And the pioneers, the Defi app builders, are just setting up their tents and selecting their campsite. So yeah, I think the way that we're approaching this problem space is there are people, there are users that have risk. How can we provide a really easy way for them to hedge that risk and the exposure that they maintain within the market? All of these Defi power users, currently the biggest trend that we've seen with yield farming is that they're earning yield denominated in native tokens. They're exposed to these native token prices without any real sophisticated management of that exposure. So we're looking to build a tool with perpetual pools that will essentially be their sort of right hand man in that sense.
00:04:43.686 - 00:04:58.140, Speaker B: So yeah, we're looking to put these tools right in the hands of those users. Essentially we're a risk management protocol and we'll build many of these different derivative contracts out over the coming years.
00:04:59.470 - 00:05:13.120, Speaker A: Sounds great. Thanks so much for sharing that. And maybe we'll jump over to Pascal and I would love to hear you can share with the audience more about what you're building and what types of assets you're working on.
00:05:14.310 - 00:05:34.482, Speaker C: Hey Dave. Hey everyone. Yeah, so it's pretty straightforward and easy. We are mainly focusing on bringing way more fiat currencies into the blockchain. So we started with euro pound and. But you know, when you have stable coins, you have few problems. The first one is the peg.
00:05:34.482 - 00:06:14.126, Speaker C: How do you maintain the peg of your asset? So how do you incentivize arbitrary to come and to realize profit in order to maintain the peg liquidity? Also how you can easily exchange a euro synthetic asset for bitcoin or for link token, for example. And we solve this issue and also capital efficiency, of course, because if you want liquidity, you need to deposit a lot of stable coins in different amms and so on. So the way we solve this issue, it's quite easy. So you have two ways to mint a synthetic asset. First way it's easy, everybody knows it already. It's similar to maker. You deposit a collateral and you self mint.
00:06:14.126 - 00:06:49.994, Speaker C: So you borrow basically to yourself J euro or JGBP, which are two of our stable coins tracking the price of euro, of course, and the british pound. And the other way to mint, for me it's quite cooler. So the way it works is that if you want to buy J euro, you will do it at the chain link price. There is no slippage. And the way it works is that there is someone else who will mint it. We call them the liquidity providers. So whenever he wants to buy $100 worth of J euro, you buy it from a liquidity provider who will mint it himself.
00:06:49.994 - 00:07:38.682, Speaker C: So basically they will borrow, so they will deposit collateral. We work with USDC as collateral, so they will deposit for example, 125 USDC of collateral and they will mint the J euro. And in the same transaction they will sell it to you, the buyer, again at the price feed provided by Chainlink. And doing so, you can buy and sell synthetic asset without the need of going to an amm. And you have a way to maintain the peg because it doesn't matter. The volume that you are trading with, you will always be executed at the market price for liquidity. It's pretty cool because since you can buy and sell those synthetic assets without slippage for USDC, so if you have jero, you can sell them for USDC to the liquidity provider.
00:07:38.682 - 00:08:13.994, Speaker C: And if you have USDC, you can buy J euro against to the liquidity product. What we can do and what we have done, you can combine two transactions within a single one. So on one hand you have an onchain forex swap. So whenever you want to, for example, buy link token with J Euro, what you're going to do, it's first an onchain forex swap without slippage. So J euro will be sold for USDC. And then we just call a swap function of any amm, it could be uniswap, for example. And we're going to just exchange a USDC for the link token or bitcoin or whatever.
00:08:13.994 - 00:08:56.274, Speaker C: And doing so, we use a native liquidity of USDC. So we leverage from the USDC deep liquidity integration. And we do not have to create a liquidity pool for our specific token. And this helps us to be ultra mega scalable. What we just need to launch a new synthetic asset. It's just basically a chaining price feed. So if tomorrow we decide to launch, for example, the synthetic zloti, which is a fiat currency in Poland, what we have to do is just to request a price feed from chainlink to deploy the contract to add liquidity in USDC in order for people to mint the synthetic asset, and then to sell it within the same transaction.
00:08:56.274 - 00:09:45.634, Speaker C: And that's all. And then anyone in Poland will be able to exchange PLN, which is the name of the currency for bitcoin or whatever, with the same price impact as USDC. And you can only do that with synthetic assets. This is why for me, they're far more superior than tokenized assets. The only advantage of a tokenized asset is of course, a fiat on and off ramp. Because, for example, for USDC or for euro from stasis, you can send them euro and you can get at a one one ratio their tokenized assets. But the thing is that since we use USDC as collateral, since we have a way to maintain the peg, because again, all the trades are happening at the chaining price feed, we have convinced a partner in Switzerland to provide a fiat on and off ramp at a one one ratio for a synthetic asset.
00:09:45.634 - 00:10:18.430, Speaker C: Which means that you can now, with your euro, with your british pound, or with your swiss franc, you can buy the same asset, but living on the blockchain synthetic assets. So with euro, you can buy J euro swiss franc. J Swiss franc. And then using the process I mentioned before, you can exchange them for any token on USOP with the same price impact as USDC. And this partner is called Montpelran. It's a swiss regulated entity. And it's pretty cool because we have a way to onboard people within defi with their own currency.
00:10:18.430 - 00:10:35.110, Speaker C: We have a way to make those stable coins liquid by using USDC as a liquidity bridge. So the next step for us is basically to add native yields so people will be able to earn passive incomes for the stable coins of a choice. So this is basically what we're doing at gerries.
00:10:36.250 - 00:11:08.882, Speaker A: Wow, thank you so much for sharing that, Pascal. Pretty amazing stuff over there. So I want to jump to Fernando now. As Ash was mentioning, there is still a little bit of education that needs to be done as far as people's familiarity with what they can do with synthetic assets. I think perhaps what you're doing is going to require even more education, because you're really pushing the boundaries of where this can go. So I want you to talk a bit about what you're building and what we can get excited for coming from your project. Yeah.
00:11:08.936 - 00:12:02.990, Speaker D: So thank you so much for inviting me. I'm Fernando, co founder of Curie Invest and the Curiodao. Basically Curio, the word curio means rare object and curio invest basically makes it possible for you, for everyone to invest in rare collectibles via fractionalized nfts. So what we've been basically working on is how to make everything or all objects in the world a tradable asset. So curios started by becoming the first player to tokenize a rare car. This is not a normal car that you see in the streets, but rather a collectible one. So basically, by structuring, wrapping it into an offering, we make it possible for everyone to purchase a token, starting with one dollars, and basically get exposure, or in a way, a piece of that Ferrari.
00:12:02.990 - 00:13:17.126, Speaker D: And basically this place us in the map as kind of the go to place for tokenization of real world physical assets. So we started with a car, became today a story of about 500 cars in a pipeline from different collectors. And together with a new flagship product that we just launched, a roll up. Basically, we're making it possible not only for us to push to our users tokenized, curated assets, but also the users to effectively have a venue adapt for them to upload assets that they have, and in a way mean a real world asset NFT backed by the asset they own. So in the future, we see that basically the community would then start fearing what assets actually get not only tokenized, but afterwards accepted somehow within the Dow. And what this means is that once you tokenize a real world asset, basically the wall of Defi becomes available. So what this means is that you can use your minted NFT or your fraction link to that NFT as a collateral.
00:13:17.126 - 00:14:23.518, Speaker D: I'm very excited about this, because what this means is that suddenly a master class that was previously illiquid, that was previously accessible only to the very wealthy, becomes more liquid thanks to the collateralization of your NFT, or more accessible thanks to the token that cost $1. So basically, what we've seen so far is a strong traction, both coming from asset originators, but also from purchases. So basically, users exciting to get exposure into these real world assets. When you look at the portfolio of these users, you have kind of two groups. On the one hand, you have crypto investors, but then you have those who are looking to diversify the current portfolio. And while investing, as you know, in crypto can be very speculative, you go through some rights. The idea of allocating a portion of your portfolio to a rare car, to a fine artwork, or eventually even to a rare whiskey, starts to make more sense.
00:14:23.518 - 00:14:44.130, Speaker D: Basically, we're here based out of Switzerland, and you probably hear about this region. There's a crypto valley which is a hub with about 900 companies. Together with Lichtenstein, there's now even a blockchain law that, in a way protects both co founders, but also investors who acquire these NFDs backed by real world assets.
00:14:44.210 - 00:14:44.502, Speaker C: Why?
00:14:44.556 - 00:15:48.338, Speaker D: Because there's already a regulatory framework that enables us to effectively create and mean this in a compliant manner. So I think those milestones have been quite exciting to put us in the map and also to leverage the assets that we have with Chainlink. Basically, one of the initial integrations we achieved was to capture the data of rare cars linked to this Ferrari, or data from various data providers who have access to historical data points. And what you see today, and I shared today on the hoping, if you scroll, you will see a link to the roll up store. You're looking at one of the first nfts. We call it Oracle because the NFT that represents the Ferrari F twelve has a real time valuation. And I think that's really exciting, because not only do you know that there's in a way, a value linked and precisely shown to your NFT, but if you happen to own it, you can then take a loan and so forth.
00:15:48.338 - 00:15:58.640, Speaker D: So that's basically invest, roll up. And if you have any questions, feel welcome to check in or drop us an email.
00:15:59.250 - 00:16:07.380, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you so much, Fernando. And we'll jump straight to Justin. As you're also pushing the limits over there, can you tell us a bit about what you're building?
00:16:07.830 - 00:17:33.114, Speaker E: Okay, so thanks for having me and for having Teraxa here so we can talk about what we're doing. Teraxa is a layer one ledger company, but we're very interested in building a ledger and a suite of applications around that ledger for capturing basically human interactions. So informal business agreements and informal business relationships, and also social reputation and social influence are the kinds of off chain interactions that we want to capture onto a chain. And where Chainlink comes into this in a vital way, is finding ways to take this off chain worldly stuff and place it into the chain. So with business agreements, for example, one of the real motivations here is you have a lot of business relationships where you don't know in the end who's going to really have custody of the information, right? So really good example might be if you're building a property and you want to sell that property to an owner someday, there's going to be original architects, there's going to be designers, there's going to be all sorts of people involved in that project. Contractors, subcontractors, and right now, a lot of those everyday business operational decisions, who you bring in, what work they did, whether or not they filed for permits, things like that. A lot of that's done over very informal communication, text messaging, email, et cetera.
00:17:33.114 - 00:18:06.534, Speaker E: Right. And it's only the big legal documents that we think of now that we capture in any sort of permanent way with signatures and whatnot. So the goal we have is to really capture all that very basic operational data on chain. So rather than being a very blockchain aware type application, this is an application where the user is going about basically their ordinary process, like wherever they're communicating via text message or email. And we give them a very easy option for anchoring that into the chain and for effectively signing off on it.
00:18:06.572 - 00:18:06.726, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:06.748 - 00:19:16.330, Speaker E: So you can get these sign offs on records and agreements, and ultimately you build up an audit trail that can be passed on to whoever takes ownership of the property or whoever gets involved down the line. These kinds of interactions are individually, they don't seem to have a lot of value, but collectively, they represent such a huge amount of the work of business activity in so many types of businesses that they end up having tremendous value, both operationally and also for establishing collateral. So you can show you've got a business relationship, a proven business relationship with someone. And the same thing is true over on, sort of like the social influencing side, right? So right now, who is an influencer and what their influence is, and when they made an influence in the off chain real world of the Internet and whatnot is very abstract, and it's hard to peg. So by anchoring that into the blockchain, you really give a chance for a decentralized evaluation of that and assigning a value to people's influence. So those are the applications we're working on. And Chainlink provides a vital link, for example, with business agreements.
00:19:16.330 - 00:19:57.530, Speaker E: A sense of time, real world time, is vital to understanding when did an agreement get signed off on and whether or not obligations were met in a timely fashion. And you might think time is a really easily ascertained value, that everyone has it. But the key part there is to be disinterested and to not be a self interested party in terms of assigning time. So that's where the decentralization comes in. So that's just the very first use for Chainlink. But there's going to be so many more use cases for Chainlink in anchoring sort of the real world that we see around us into the blockchain for assigning value to these relationships.
00:19:57.870 - 00:20:21.634, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you so much for sharing that and well, in the interest of time here, jump into a little bit of a speed round on this next question so everyone can have an opportunity to answer. We heard a little bit about how you incorporated chainlink there. Maybe we can hear from the other panelists a bit more about the mechanism behind your design and how Chainlink plays a role in that. Ash, why don't you take it away from there?
00:20:21.752 - 00:21:20.006, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, with our first product that we'll be launching to market, it's a financial primitive, much the same as a uniswap, much the same as an ave. So there'll be no margin accounts, no liquidations, and it'll be a fully fungible, interoperable ERC 20 with a long and a short position. Chainlink will be the oracle provider for that, and essentially rebalance pools. I won't get much more into it. There'll be a white paper to come. But we've integrated the Chainlink keeper very much at the core of our product, as well as working with the head of data at Chainlink to pioneer these new markets that Pat alluded to in the tracer Dao speech before.
00:21:20.006 - 00:21:38.746, Speaker B: So we took a lot of our inspiration there from Richard Sander, the father of financial futures. And essentially, we will be deploying a number of these different markets on top of the tracer product. But, yeah, we'll leave it there.
00:21:38.928 - 00:21:42.080, Speaker A: Perfect. Thanks so much, Ash. Pascal, you want to jump in here?
00:21:44.690 - 00:22:26.746, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So for now, we are using Chainlink for their price feed. So as I said before, someone can buy or can sell any of our synthetic assets without slippage for USDC or actually for any of our synthetic assets as a chain link. Moving forward, we are deploying to multiple blockchains. But the thing is that we want to keep the liquidation and the dispute system happening on Ethereum, which means that we need a convenient way to communicate between the chains. And it happens that as you know, Chainlink will be soon releasing technology to communicate between blockchains. So this will be very useful for us and it will allow us to expand to multiple blockchain wherever chaining price feed are also possible.
00:22:26.746 - 00:22:49.730, Speaker C: And we're also considering, of course, using keepers for now. Every orders are market orders. At some point, we'll need to introduce limit orders as well. And also those keepers may be useful for liquidation. So, yeah, actually chaining start to be like a full DevOps service for us. So this is the way we are using now and how we move forward of chain.
00:22:50.470 - 00:22:58.214, Speaker A: Perfect. Thanks, Pascal. And Fernando, you mentioned a little bit about the real time data there do you want to comment on that, too?
00:22:58.412 - 00:23:51.830, Speaker D: Yeah. So when you look at the collateral, basically the idea of investing in tokens starts with the token itself, but it doesn't stop there. The question is, what do you do with token once you have it, once you have possession of it? And a current best, basically, will make it possible for you to pledge it on a vault, that it's in a way linked to chain link, and therefore knows what the value of the token is, or in other words, what the value of the underlying is and can provide you, in a way, a loan. But traditionally this was already possible, but it was a very lengthy process. Thanks to this ecosystem, you can effectively get a loan, an instant loan, backed by your tokenized asset. And this is done via this chain oracle. And basically you get a stable coin backed now by the collateral.
00:23:51.830 - 00:24:11.290, Speaker D: So, thanks. In the future, what we envision is that there will be oracles that represent various assets, classes such as red cars, paintings and so forth. And therefore, this would slowly improve the liquidity of non bankable assets or illiquid assets.
00:24:12.590 - 00:24:33.550, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much, Fernando, and everyone else on this panel. It's been a pleasure, and we can all look forward to the releases that each of you mentioned. Please check out everything that everyone on this panel is building. Thank you so much for being here. And we will hand it back over to the host from here. Thank you all.
00:24:33.620 - 00:24:35.302, Speaker D: Thank you very much. Have a nice you.
00:24:35.356 - 00:24:35.942, Speaker E: Thanks, everyone.
00:24:35.996 - 00:24:37.490, Speaker C: Have a good one, you guys. Bye.
