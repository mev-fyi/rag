00:00:19.130 - 00:00:40.482, Speaker A: Thanks again, Del. Yes, for hosting us today. Great to have everyone here. As Tatiana said, we like to do this usually on, on a monthly basis. Today we're joined by a great panel, I think to kick things off. Firstly, the focus today is web3 startups, roadmap to blockchain success. I think people say a bear market to build as market.
00:00:40.482 - 00:00:54.540, Speaker A: So I think this is an appropriate topic for today's panel. Things kick things off. We can start off by going through the panel. Maybe if everyone could introduce yourselves what you're working on and, yeah, things off there.
00:00:55.090 - 00:01:32.490, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Stefan. I'm the founder and CEO of Truthlation.com. I got into bitcoin in 2012. So over a decade of experience in crypto, I was most recently the CEO of Bitcoin.com. Scaled that to 20 million wallets and 500,000 merchants where you could actually go and buy physical products, services and goods with crypto. And in 2020, when the government shut down the money, they printed a lot of new money into the market and told us not to worry about it. They got it covered and we wouldn't experience inflation.
00:01:32.490 - 00:01:54.930, Speaker B: And that was the impetus and the genesis behind trueflation.com, where we now track 18 million items. We have three price feeds per item. We work extremely closely with Chainlink to make those available across six different blockchains. And now some 150 dev teams globally, working and building on top of inflation.
00:01:55.990 - 00:02:17.670, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you everyone. My name is Carlos Savedra. I'm one of the co founders of five treasury. We are looking to help crypto companies manage their on chain treasuries. So we're doing this through liquidity pool that we've modified to act as an onchain ETF or on chain index fund. We've been working on this for about a year now.
00:02:17.670 - 00:02:53.460, Speaker C: The idea actually started here at LBS. I was one of the co founders of the blockchain Society and I was their first treasurer. My first task was to start up their dow. So as I was researching this back in 2021, realized that, hey, Harvard and Columbia and all these other university dows have millions of dollars in their treasuries. LBS can get to the same level, but realized there's really no good solutions for treasury management, not in a way that's on chain and transparent. So we've been building this for the last couple months. We just launched our Testnet app about two weeks ago, and the goal is to launch on Mainet in the fall.
00:02:54.950 - 00:03:24.074, Speaker D: Alex Matu here. I'm the web3 team of AWS for Europe first, thanks Chenley for organizing this. It's really great to see an institution like FBS hosting a web3 event. I think it's the first time ever that there's a web3 event, so that's really good. I'm a fan of 2016 2017. In terms of crypto, I started with a bunch of friends. All my friends who started back then, 20, 16, 17, are either millionaire or in prison.
00:03:24.122 - 00:03:24.720, Speaker C: Now.
00:03:26.930 - 00:03:33.746, Speaker D: I'm neither, hopefully all weekly. I'm an ex founder. I started a company here in the.
00:03:33.768 - 00:03:35.060, Speaker C: UK in the crypto space.
00:03:35.590 - 00:04:17.630, Speaker D: Obviously didn't get millionaire in prison then. That was on crypto exchange OKX, the second largest in terms of volume. And now at AWS, we're trying to do everything that goes beyond just infrastructure and cloud. So if you're looking on three areas that can help you, it's one, how you can raise money. We help you raise money as we are collaborating with the VC. Two, how you can partner with the whole ecosystem in terms of commercial strategic partnership, and three more the marketing go to market event type speaking engagements. But maybe we can deep dive a little bit further.
00:04:18.770 - 00:04:19.278, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:04:19.364 - 00:04:52.442, Speaker E: Hey guys, I'm sit Shah. As part mentioned, I'm the incoming co president of the LBS Blockchain Society. I am currently doing a part time master's in finance at LBS and full time. I work at Motive Partners, which is a fintech investment firm. I'm on the digital assets team there. So what we do is we've got a PE arm, we've got a Vc arm, and we've got a portfolio value creation and venture incubation arm. So we build products, we incubate products, we've got a strategy and development team.
00:04:52.442 - 00:05:24.162, Speaker E: So doing quite a lot there, building out institutional grade crypto products and incubating them. And yeah, also got my own blog and podcast in the space called Genesis Block. So if anyone's interested, I can pass on the details. Little plug there and yeah, really excited about this event and all the things that we're going to do with the blockchain society over the coming year. It's been great to be involved in the last year, doing a lot of stuff in governance and delegation at Aave Makerdao, getting right into the nittygritties of the space. It's been fantastic to be involved and.
00:05:24.216 - 00:05:25.300, Speaker D: Great to be here.
00:05:26.230 - 00:05:59.630, Speaker F: Hi everyone, I'm Avas Gazmi. I'm a partner and head of Webtree at Black Ventures and co founder and managing partner collegiate Capital Invest in web3, Fintech and Climatech. Been in the space since 2014, also work on the regulatory side. So since 2018 I've been advising UAE government on their policy towards Metaverse and web3. And then last year I was asked to co found all party parliamentary group on Metaverse and web3 in the UK, advising the UK on their policy towards the space and always keen to hear from people working on interesting projects. So come find me after the event if you're working on something.
00:05:59.780 - 00:06:00.720, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:06:01.490 - 00:06:08.978, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks guys. So I think something we've noticed that's in common with all the panelists is that you all work with projects who.
00:06:08.984 - 00:06:10.290, Speaker C: Would be in early stages.
00:06:10.790 - 00:06:40.090, Speaker A: So whether it's supporting with treasury management or whether it's helping them big shots liquidity get off the ground, trueflation help sponsor Chainlink's hackathon that just concluded in the last week. So all these projects helping out kind of up and comers in the space, as I mentioned before, people talk about a bear market being a builder's market. What are some trends? Firstly, what are your thoughts on that? And secondly, what are some trends you're noticing in the current bear market? Among early stage startups?
00:06:41.250 - 00:07:30.970, Speaker B: It's definitely a lot fewer startups in the market, that's for sure. Liquidity has dried up, so it's been very hard to raise money as a startup. The regulatory framework, especially in the US, has made it very difficult for startups. A lot of investors are uncertain and then ultimately AI has shifted. A lot of the current thing is AI, right? So everybody's building AI solutions, but the great thing for products like a chainlink or trueflation is we work with data and AI agents need data. And so that plays for both parties and it has upsides. But yeah, a lot of builders and the people that are serious are still in the industry, which is great to see.
00:07:30.970 - 00:07:47.090, Speaker B: So you really know, we call them in the industry, we call them the tourists have left. And so it's now the new inhabitants and the immigrants that are now building new houses, new infrastructure to support this new ecosystem.
00:07:47.750 - 00:08:33.682, Speaker D: If I may just redound what you said about regulation and you mentioned the ATC, I think this is actually a great opportunity for Europe and the UK. I mean, you saw a couple of weeks ago, apt, they announced they're going to open the first ever international office. It's going to be in London. And guess what? It's going to be a crypto hub. ASICT, indeed, 35 billion assets under management, out of which 8 billion is dedicated to web3 and crypto. It shows the amount of traction and rich tonight, even commented on it, right, saying that we welcoming the web3 project and the web3 money. So yes, we are in a better market, but still the traction is here and it's going to be more and more visible in the next few months.
00:08:33.682 - 00:09:32.990, Speaker D: If you look at the concept side, working with a lot of crypto VCs and workplace VCs, first half of the year has been the worst half since 2020. And if we continue with that trend in next few days, June will be the worst month in terms of funding since November. So it tells you how depressed in a way we are in terms of state as well. Most of the investments, half of them are in pre CMCs, which used to be a bit more, I would say better split between the different rounds in the past. If you look at the UK, though, we're still number two in terms of countries where you see the most investment. And one interesting thing in the UK is that compared to other region, there's a skew towards financial elements and startups. So Defi and Defi are receiving more money here in the UK compared to other region.
00:09:32.990 - 00:09:39.206, Speaker D: When you make some kind of comparison, it's not financial advice, by the way, just what we observed, what country in.
00:09:39.228 - 00:09:40.280, Speaker B: Europe is number.
00:09:43.530 - 00:10:25.394, Speaker D: Between? It fluctuates between France, Switzerland and Germany. Those three countries are always leading the path, depending. But even if you add those three countries, you sometimes not even arrive at the level of UK. Depending on the horizon we're looking at now, it's a quantitative side, right? And if I may just finish on the qualitative side when we talk to those VCs. Yes, now is not the best time to invest. A lot of, I would say smart money has shift into Gen AI and LL and they don't need to wait Q four or Q one next year to redeploy that capital. And it's going to happen no matter what.
00:10:25.394 - 00:10:30.950, Speaker D: So it's a matter also of talking to the right person and keeping those relationships in the meantime.
00:10:31.450 - 00:11:09.594, Speaker C: I'll say, just like Stefan said, there's tourists that people are building. There's also the same with VCs. We've been really lucky of being like an outlier. We've done a couple of rounds, but oversubscribed every time. And I think the VCs that are staying and are still deploying, they really understand the space, they really value investors, the ones we talk to, that on the first meeting, we just know they don't get the space right. They don't know what a market maker or balancer works and things like that. Just basic stuff that they should know if you're trying to invest in Defi, those groups either don't have capital or they're just shifting good riddles probably decade.
00:11:09.642 - 00:11:56.494, Speaker F: The points made by the other panelists, I'd say actually it's a healthy correction. If you look at what was happening, the valuations and the hype, hopefully a lot of the scam project, the tourists have been flushed away and now is the time really for serious builders in the space. But also what I've noticed is that a lot of more infrastructure projects being built in the blockchain space rather than just hype projects on quick get rich quick schemes in terms of tokens, NFTs, et cetera. And it's the overlap with other industries. So the intersection between AI and blockchain, other sectors, legal tech, fintech, also the institutional interest in the space is something that's been very interesting to see. Companies like Blackrock, JP Morgan, et cetera. There's a huge increase in the amount of interest they've shown in the space.
00:11:56.494 - 00:12:11.174, Speaker F: And also from a government point of view, the rise of interest in central bankers decisions, currencies, et cetera. And more and more attention is being catered space. I think it's healthy overall what's happening, and it needed to happen. Otherwise there's an overheat and it'll be a matter of time before things get better.
00:12:11.212 - 00:13:00.086, Speaker E: Again, just to finish on that point, right, in terms of people actually building products that have real world utility, of course, there's definitely been a correction. Yeah, I agree. Needed. But some of the things that I've seen, and currently I'm working on building alongside admotive, like for example, actually things that push the space forward and they'll give real use cases. For example, at the moment we're building an institutional marketplace to source decentralized capital to back webfields. Now, insurance is one of the most underserved areas in the space. You've got institutions who are interested in putting their money on the line to actually go and build something in this space, right? You're trying to build products that make it easier for financial institutions to offer crypto products to their customers.
00:13:00.086 - 00:13:17.020, Speaker E: You're seeing a lot of innovation in actually real world asset products and projects, right? You've got people like Franklin Templeton spoke to them very recently, and they've got on chain money market funds that drastically reduce costs and make it a lot easier for people to invest.
00:13:18.910 - 00:13:19.434, Speaker C: In real.
00:13:19.472 - 00:13:43.570, Speaker E: World products and assets. So yeah, you've definitely got a lot of bad actors and everything that were essentially on the hype train flushed away and now. Yeah, the barriers for building and you see a lot of activity where people are actually building and doing things to push the space forward rather than just piggybacking on the latest hype.
00:13:44.550 - 00:14:17.520, Speaker A: Yeah, interesting. I just want to ask Carson, Sid, quick question. I know you guys obviously very close to what's going on with the blockchain set up at LBS. We talk about tourists coming and going between a bullet of air market, obviously during a bull market. Suddenly there's a wave of students who are like, oh, I want to get into web3 now it's AI. What are you observing is the difference with the next generation coming through and how I suppose current market is affecting people who want to get into the space or now don't want to get into the space.
00:14:18.610 - 00:15:01.050, Speaker E: I could start because we've tried to recruit more people for next year and yeah, it's not been that easy because you're right, people do look at what's in the news and go like, oh yeah, where's blockchain? Actually spoken about that recently or like, oh, what's happening with crypto coins? They've all failed, haven't they? And you were like, well, we're not really trying to do that, things like that. But yes, you've obviously seen less interest, I would say, for the people who actually come to you right now are like, oh, I'm interested. I've worked in the space before. Or it's people who have actually done something in web3 or understand a little bit about it rather than the whole people who would be more interested. Who were more interested at the beginning of last day, for example.
00:15:01.120 - 00:15:01.498, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:01.584 - 00:15:34.550, Speaker E: I think that I'm predicting, I guess in a couple of months when we're trying to recruit new students to join the society, to help out in covenants, to help out in a bunch of different areas. It's going to be a little more difficult because it's just that the attention has shifted away a little bit. We understand that what we are trying to build towards a lot of people in the space understand that and that's why we stuck around. It's because we have the belief, but for new people, it's just a whole new world that you have to introduce to them and when it's not top of mind, it's kind of out of sight.
00:15:35.130 - 00:16:05.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I added just different career trajectory. LBS. There's a lot of people that go into work at central banks or for governments at LBS. Right. We're consulting investment banking, these very catered paths and in blockchain. If you spend a bit of time learning, it almost makes more sense to go to your own startup, right? There's so much capital, so it's a little bit of a power law effect. In this last couple of one or two years we've seen a few startups come out of LBS blockchain site have been really awesome.
00:16:05.390 - 00:16:35.802, Speaker C: People building on Sphinx, people building like decentralized YouTube that raised a fair amount of capital and are kind of up and running. So that's pretty exciting. I think over the next year it'll be about identifying those people that really want to be founders and then trying to hedge us as much as possible because they'll really will move LBs in the whole industry forward. And that's very different than some of the other clubs at LBs that are about structured recruiting, bringing managers, and there's a lot of gatekeepers there. But with Web three there's really not.
00:16:35.856 - 00:16:36.554, Speaker B: It's a lot different.
00:16:36.592 - 00:16:42.746, Speaker C: It's a different mindset, obviously. So it's trying to shift people's perceptions about gaining experience.
00:16:42.848 - 00:16:43.114, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:43.152 - 00:16:51.646, Speaker C: People always come to me like, I don't have any experience. How do I get into crypto? Go join Discord and just join a Dow, right? It's very different than trying to work.
00:16:51.668 - 00:16:52.558, Speaker B: At a bank and you need to.
00:16:52.564 - 00:17:08.520, Speaker C: Go do all these coffee shops. But we really hope over this next year Lbs will be a really good hub. We're already partnered with ASICs and Z, we were their delegates last year and we're hopeful that they'll be really committed to helping us grow and using us as a way to really help launch startups here.
00:17:08.890 - 00:17:15.410, Speaker B: I love startups. Right. So to your point, it's so invigorating, it's adrenalizing.
00:17:15.490 - 00:17:17.000, Speaker C: You need a lot of energy.
00:17:18.890 - 00:17:38.398, Speaker B: And I've launched some ten startups or something now. Some went really well. I was down to my on one of my startups didn't work out. I maxed out all my credit cards. I was huge in debt. I had three kids in school, I had to pay rent, I went to the ATM. Nothing.
00:17:38.398 - 00:18:19.338, Speaker B: None of the cards worked. I had no money and I didn't dare tell my wife that was the case and I was pretty much rock bottom. I made all my money, I reinvested it and deployed it, lost everything again. And then you go back and some other new technology came along and made it all back again. But luckily the most joyous moment was on the Friday. This was maybe on a Wednesday or something, and then on a Friday a customer paid their bill and I could pay salaries, I could pay my rent, I could pay. So that's how quick it comes together, right? What do we say?
00:18:19.504 - 00:18:20.874, Speaker D: One year is like a dog year.
00:18:20.912 - 00:18:47.220, Speaker B: And then multiply that. In crypto, one year is a dog year. So you have two different dog years in one year, right? So it's like one year is equal to 14 in a normal bank or a big company or something like that. So just beware of that and just go, man, if you really believe this idea is going to work, you just got to go. Don't ask, don't question, you'll stumble, you'll fall. We all fall. There's no doubt about it.
00:18:47.220 - 00:19:07.900, Speaker B: You don't want to be in a situation where you have no credit cards, no money left. But what I learned from that is never again will I encounter and put all my wealth at my personal wealth, at that risk anymore. The opportunity cost is too big. And that's why your VCs who help take that opportunity cost off your back.
00:19:09.150 - 00:19:30.286, Speaker G: Hi Briggy inquiry, thank you so much for that. We briefly talked about emerging economies right now, and that's what my question is about. There's like immense research papers of the benefits of web3 for emerging economies. Especially like DeFi bring benefits to underbanked, unbanked people in these countries. But you do not see a lot of web3 startups in emerging economies.
00:19:30.318 - 00:19:31.106, Speaker F: You do not see a lot of.
00:19:31.128 - 00:20:03.530, Speaker G: Companies like Coinbase prioritizing emerging economies. I asked director of marketing of Coinbase question when they came to my university and they straight up said, we're not prioritizing on european economies. So in the way the current system is organized, GaP is organized in the west and everything, and how a lot of accelerated programs are existing in these countries and everything. How do you think we can create incentives for governments and emerging economies to focus about it, bring the benefits of treating these people? But on a second poll, how do we create incentives for companies like Coinbase to prioritize emerging economies?
00:20:04.670 - 00:20:45.066, Speaker C: I can speak to my family is Guatemalan, half my family is like indigenous mayan. So I always think about a lot how can I open up the financial system to them? But if you really look at them, a lot of them hardly have access to the Internet or like a laptop. So it's very basic infrastructure that does not exist, unfortunately. And the governments, at least for water wallets, like pretty entrenched, kind of just corrupt, happy to kind of just stay where they're at. I'm a big fan of what Jambo is doing Africa. They're actually incentivizing phones that have wallets built into them and that's how they want to onboard users just have Internet access, but then also be able to use kind of defi products. I think things like that are very interesting.
00:20:45.066 - 00:20:51.020, Speaker C: It comes down to like a hardware problem, which software and tech companies, that's just not the field of play.
00:20:51.710 - 00:21:30.378, Speaker F: I think the point you made was interesting where you said Coinbase have been looking outside of Europe and other companies. I don't think the answer is going to be western companies coming to save the developing world and shining arm. I think it needs to be local solutions being developed by entrepreneurs in those markets that understand those conditions and the unique quirks and complexities of their home markets. Whether that's founders coming from having been educated here, worked here, and then going back to their home countries or other people moving there, et cetera. There are lots of great examples. Obviously they're not as well funded or haven't received as much media attention as some of these other western companies. But give it a few years and I think we'll start to see some.
00:21:30.384 - 00:21:54.910, Speaker C: Of the rewards I will add to. Ethereum foundation is doing a great job on trying to access that, how to kind of crack that puzzle. They gave out some grants to people in Guatemala who are building kind of web3 and doing research on how to bring blockchain to that kind of edge of system. So I would definitely look into that. Thinking about brands, research topics. Ethereum foundation.
00:21:56.370 - 00:22:24.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's going to come from within. I mean, look at the chainlink hackathons we had so many different from all over the world, a lot of emerging countries too. And one of the winners was placian out of Venezuela. Right? They were building a lottery ticket scheme and they were leveraging that. You see big companies. India is huge, right? I mean, in crypto, Argentina is huge in crypto. Right? All the auditors, all the third world, decentraland, those are all out of Argentina.
00:22:24.890 - 00:22:44.990, Speaker B: Yeah. And polygon, you've got Wazirex, you can go on and on. There are lots of. In Africa, I mean jambo, I mean, Nigeria. Huge payment solutions. You pay with crypto, right? I mean, not like here. And then you have the IMF that says, no, I'm not allowed to have bitcoin as a national currency, but that's a different topic.
00:22:44.990 - 00:22:54.958, Speaker B: But yeah, so you have those elements that you see a lot of innovation where the infrastructure is there. I have enough electricity and I have an Internet connection.
00:22:55.134 - 00:23:58.906, Speaker E: And it's also about product market fit to a large extent. If you're talking about western companies or protocols or whatever, who would actually be most useful in emerging economies, right? I mean, the places which have a lot of crypto usage are actually in terms of an economic perspective, like Stefan mentioned, you've got Argentina, which huge inflation problems, turkey, huge inflation problems, where the national currencies are actually not as privileged as the national currencies of western countries. So where you've got product market fit, where you've got people who can actually benefit significantly from holding their assets in stable coins or even actually in the highest money that is bitcoin, it would really be beneficial for them. And that's where you see a lot of uptake. Now, in terms of incentives, I think it's a little bit difficult because a lot of this technology is based on hard math. It's based on computer science, it's based on infrastructural capabilities being available for the.
00:23:58.928 - 00:24:00.106, Speaker D: Citizens of that country.
00:24:00.208 - 00:24:14.426, Speaker E: And those need to be developed. Unfortunately, that's beyond the purview of other economies to be able to do that or to engender that. And that does need to come from.
00:24:14.448 - 00:24:15.834, Speaker D: Within, like Abba said, as well.
00:24:15.872 - 00:24:24.160, Speaker E: So it's a combination of some of these factors of need, but also know the grassroots taking on.
00:24:24.950 - 00:24:54.870, Speaker D: We see definitely a lot of innovation from those regions. I mean, Latam, Africa, Southeast Asia, there's a fantastic community and third world economy there. Look at two countries who took bitcoin as a digital center. El Salvador and Central African Republic. So there are definitely a lot of things. And it's also sometimes a matter of maturity of the market. Someone was asking what you learned as a founder.
00:24:54.870 - 00:25:20.994, Speaker D: As an ex founder, I failed as an ex founder. And one of the biggest lesson that I learned from it is sometimes you need to accept that as an innovator, that being told that you're wrong for a long time and go against what everybody is telling you. And maybe in those regions, sometimes the market is not there yet, but they need to be bold enough and strong enough to be told they're wrong for a long time.
00:25:21.032 - 00:25:21.282, Speaker C: Enough.
00:25:21.336 - 00:25:32.262, Speaker D: You took Amazon as an example earlier, Jeff Bezos, when he tried to raise his first amount of money, he wanted millions. He got $70 right, and look where he is now.
00:25:32.316 - 00:25:33.798, Speaker E: Sometimes you need to be bold and.
00:25:33.884 - 00:25:36.840, Speaker D: Strong enough, which I wasn't back then.
00:25:37.950 - 00:26:08.334, Speaker H: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the talk today. So I have two questions, one for Stefan and for Alex. So first, Stefan, so you say that you scale bitcoin.com to 20 million wallets. So I wanted to know what was the strategy behind that. What would you do today if you had to restart that for a lot of companies projects? And Alex, the question is about the marketing.
00:26:08.334 - 00:26:39.386, Speaker H: You said that you provide marketing for project within AWS. So I wanted to know what's the trend and how do you see the marketing in web3 and how do you use social media today? I know in web two there are a lot of new tools that we can use to promote our project, like TikTok platform, which is very trending today. So I wanted to know, what is your point about, I mean, how do.
00:26:39.408 - 00:27:13.974, Speaker B: We grow mean, we built for mobile, so we went mobile first. That was what mattered. We built a self custodial wallet. And it was actually not just a wallet, it was actually an app, a super app. And we had news in there, we had discovery, we had maps in there. We had all the chat capabilities, interaction support. And so that sort of built out more of a sort of content money for us.
00:27:13.974 - 00:27:43.860, Speaker B: And of course you could onboard, right? You could buy, use a credit card to buy crypto. And we have gaming in there too. So crypto games as well as crypto gambling. But it wasn't gambling. It was really just sort of roll the dice and luck at the Satoshi dice and Satoshi cards and stuff. And we had a very good network. We had evangelists around the world.
00:27:43.860 - 00:28:20.986, Speaker B: We were in, I think, 260 countries around the world. We had community meetups regularly and we had merchants. So our whole goal is how could we make utility associated with your coin? Because at the time, bear in mind, at the beginning, this was pre Defi summer, right? So there was no defi yet. Nobody really knew what DeFi was. It was a peer to peer electronic cash system. And so we needed to build a merchandise. So again, for mobile, all these small shops in emerging markets, they needed to receive money.
00:28:20.986 - 00:29:04.780, Speaker B: They couldn't have credit card or cash. And every time it was cash, it would get bigger, bigger piles of cash, and they would be exposed to riots or theft. They actually all opted in to have it in crypto in a wallet, and then they could have it sent immediately to a different stored address. So we built out these kind of things and went to market with that and educated everybody. Like meetups like this, exactly where you're educating, you're sharing how to learn how to distinguish from people in the industry, not from outside scammers, but from people living, breathing, building in the industry. That's the only way you learn. And we invested a lot in that.
00:29:06.430 - 00:29:41.330, Speaker D: Thank you for your question. I think there's two elements what we do in terms of marketing and how we do it with the web, three elements, which is a very good point. So what we're trying to do is really give the maximum visibility to the startups that are bidding on us. So it can be doing an event and posting on social, telling our better together story with blog posts, with articles, sole leadership. There can be some kind of speaking engagement as well at events, for example, and how we do it. That's interesting. We still use the web two tools.
00:29:41.330 - 00:29:50.040, Speaker D: Exactly. So we're not there yet where we use all the web. Three elements. I can't reveal everything, but that's something that we're thinking about.
00:29:50.410 - 00:30:13.700, Speaker B: And build, look at the build program. They give you visibility, you get marketing, you get partners, you get community, they market you as well. Right. So in addition to AWS, if you're looking to launch, you go to build, you go to AWs, you do a deal, you need liquidity pools in the back end, you go to five and all of a sudden you're four steps down the road, you're nearly launching. You just need to find the engineers to build it.
00:30:16.710 - 00:30:17.362, Speaker E: Hello.
00:30:17.496 - 00:30:20.802, Speaker A: Okay, great. So I guess this is a question.
00:30:20.856 - 00:30:22.420, Speaker E: For every single one of you, right?
00:30:23.750 - 00:30:40.890, Speaker D: From where you're sitting, whether you're VC, your project, or builder, what is one single trend in crypto that you are most excited about? And what is the biggest obstacle in realizing that particular vision?
00:30:42.510 - 00:31:39.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you look at today, we have currencies that are managed by central banks. We have a large set of stablecoins that are managed by centralized entities like a tether or a circle. And there's this whole emergence of decentralized stablecoins that hasn't really taken off for whatever reason. Trust, maturity of the software, the lack of open source software to solve and hold the coin secure and scale at global level, and a regulatory framework. Right. I mean, in essence, these decentralized stablecoins are competing against the incumbents, the regulators, as well as the central institutions that are benefiting from this centralized entity. So it's a very challenging task overall.
00:31:39.810 - 00:32:02.030, Speaker B: And what is the next defi summer to enable that? I'm most excited about inflation protected stablecoins so that you can have what we call a flat coin that keeps your purchasing power so all your hard earned money doesn't get diluted. That's mine.
00:32:02.110 - 00:32:15.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a great answer. I think in the long term I've been super bullish on dows. I'm a Dow. Maxi think it has the opportunity to really change even how I think the end game for dows are like tax collection, for example.
00:32:15.740 - 00:32:15.974, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:16.012 - 00:33:06.470, Speaker C: That's something where you came into it, you don't necessarily know where it goes into. But if you think about it, Dow and shared community treasury, that is something that could be, you can have a community be like, why can we pull money together to fix this road and ensure that it's actually being efficiently spent? I think that feature is probably two, three cycles away in the near term. It's defi, right. Existing products, there's a lot of still existing financial products that don't exist in crypto or are very efficient still. There's things that have come up just in the last year or two, like L2s work, home liquidity, for example, that now enable some of these products to really work properly. And hopefully the regulation really kind of clarifies things for the next couple of months or next couple of years so that these products can really start getting brought to ethereum or different layer ones at scale.
00:33:08.490 - 00:33:58.550, Speaker D: I don't think that we can summarize with only one use case. That's the beauty of web3. But if I have to give you three use cases, three barriers, and I'm going to more or less summarize what we already discussed, gaming NFT with loyalty programs and defi with tokenization. I think Northern Trust released a report saying that 10% of all the assets globally will be tokenized within the next five years. So potentially tomorrow you can buy a fraction of my watch, you can buy a fraction of the energy, a fraction of the building or things like that. Barriers as many. I think we already mentioned regulation, education and security, security of the code, security of the hack, and security in general within the webcam.
00:33:59.390 - 00:34:41.800, Speaker E: Yeah. So my core thesis actually, for why I believe in the space is the democratization of finance, actually. So that's why my answer would be the tokenization of real world assets. And I've said that before, and that's the reason that I'm excited for the next however many years. And it's because it actually gives people the opportunity to invest in many different kinds of kinds of assets, to actually be able to tune their portfolios according to their preferences. And I think that's very important because the reason that there's a lot of inequality in the world is because of the lack of investment opportunities to people. And it keeps on getting worse and worse because you keep on giving rich people better opportunities to invest.
00:34:41.800 - 00:35:22.338, Speaker E: And the ability to distribute products that have more fine tuned risk profiles to individuals will actually hopefully help reduce that level of inequality. And there are quite a lot of challenges to that. I mean, a couple just off the top of my head would be obviously regulation is one of them. You need a lot of laws, a lot of regulations are created for the world that we're in today, not the world that we want to be in. So a lot of that has to change. But also actually a core problem is liquidity, because if you've got an illiquid asset, it's actually very difficult to gain liquidity for that asset. Even if you fractionalize it a lot.
00:35:22.338 - 00:35:41.866, Speaker E: The solutions could be something like actually creating baskets of different types of assets with similar risk profiles and then bundling them up, things like that. And that's what tokenization and blockchain technology enables. But yeah, the use case I'm most bullish on, I'm most excited about for the next. How many decades is this one? Because it'll just help make the world.
00:35:41.888 - 00:35:43.290, Speaker B: A little bit more equal.
00:35:43.950 - 00:36:11.346, Speaker F: Yeah, all of the above. But I'd say real world assets tokenization plan, in particular a couple of portfolio companies we're very excited about want to tokenize your copyright, for example, tokenizing bank deposits, et cetera. But my answer I think for this question is what I'm excited most about the space is the diversity in the space and how supportive communities are. It's very rare to find other industries that can compete in terms of the level of support, the level of vision as well, that people kind of a.
00:36:11.368 - 00:36:12.514, Speaker C: Lot of people in the web3.
00:36:12.552 - 00:36:58.626, Speaker F: Space come across as evangelists and some people think it's too much, but actually it's people who believe in the power of community decentralization, the ability for diverse people around the world to get involved as well, which is very refreshing when you look at a lot of founders of these companies or people operating in the space. I'd say on the flip side, one of the big challenges for builders in the space and we haven't touched upon it that much, but it's the lack of shortage of technical talent. So there's a massive developer shortage. So there are a lot of people who have great ideas and they want to build and it's very difficult for them to find the talent to actually build it. And then also developers that are available are very, very expensive. So with time that will improve and levels of training programs and courses, et cetera. But yeah, that's a big sticking point.
00:36:58.648 - 00:37:16.680, Speaker D: At the moment if you want to start a startup. In tokenization, there's three barriers that was mentioned, regulation, liquidity, but the third one is education. Who knows how to trade a fraction of the watch or a fraction of the energy or a fraction of a building? Please start.
00:37:20.570 - 00:37:23.940, Speaker A: Thanks so much for the great questions. Guys, can we get a round of applause for a great.
