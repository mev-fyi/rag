00:00:01.930 - 00:00:45.626, Speaker A: What we're implementing is what we call off chain aggregation. And this works by sending a single aggregate response into the chain for every oracle update. So this feature requires a few moving parts to get right. First you need to have a peer to peer networking layer. You need to have an off chain lightweight consensus model to help Oracle networks come to an aggregate responds in a distributed and trust minimalized manner. And then you need a reliable protocol using which different nodes can take turns to post final transactions onto the multiple chains that we support. So this goal is actually really important because it's going to allow us to scale up the number of oracles per feed with.
00:00:45.648 - 00:00:46.842, Speaker UNK: Almost no extra cost.
00:00:46.976 - 00:00:47.274, Speaker A: And.
00:00:47.312 - 00:00:48.090, Speaker UNK: It'S going to provide.
00:00:48.160 - 00:01:16.690, Speaker A: Huge operational savings per feed at a time when we don't know how high certain fees in networks like Ethereum could spike. Using these savings, we could definitely increase the accuracy and frequency of updates per feed. We could set up even more additional data feeds. And I think that I like to build with a practical objective in mind. And right now that is to serve the defi demand we're seeing today. Bye.
