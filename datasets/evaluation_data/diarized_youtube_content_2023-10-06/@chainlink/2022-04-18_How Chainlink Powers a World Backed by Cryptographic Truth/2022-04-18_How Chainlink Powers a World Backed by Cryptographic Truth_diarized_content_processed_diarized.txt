00:00:01.770 - 00:00:49.420, Speaker A: The third and most important thing that I feel the chainlink network is generating is a truth machine. The truth machine is actually what I feel most excited about and what I think will create the largest impact on society and many different societies globally. And actually how those societies interact with each other. Because there is, is a deep seated problem when we as a society, or as a set of global societies cannot agree on what the truth is. And in many cases, that is not possible in agreements that fail. In many other cases, it's not possible between institutions. And I sometimes feel that it's not even possible at a societal level.
00:00:49.420 - 00:01:40.414, Speaker A: And that is a very serious problem. That's a problem that's worth solving, and it's a problem worth working on. And it's a body of work that I am personally very excited to be a part of. And I'm very grateful to be working on with the amazing people in the blockchain industry and the amazing people in the chainlink community and ecosystem. And I feel that we all have an important role to play in how we as a large group of developers, and academics, and security researchers, and node operators and data providers, and even average community members, can once again impact the world in this critical, critical way. Where we take the world from something powered by paper guarantees and no shared truth, to a world powered by cryptographic guarantees and definitive truth. That is the body of that.
00:01:40.414 - 00:01:57.260, Speaker A: All of this is about, I think, that Chainlink network, and we as a community, and we as an ecosystem have an important role to play in that. And I'm extremely proud of the immense work that we've been able to do as a large group of people working together during this past year.
