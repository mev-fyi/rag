00:00:00.330 - 00:01:00.442, Speaker A: For the next five years, probably at least five years, there will be two Internet of contracts. There will be a public blockchain Internet of contracts, which you re very familiar with. And then there will be a bank Internet of contracts, which will be separate because it has a separate set of like basically legal requirements. And we are in the process of merging these two worlds because both of the worlds are now starting to run on a single messaging system, messaging standard, which is what CCIP is. It's a messaging system to interconnect all of the chains and all of the applications on the chains, both in terms of their value and in terms of their messages. The next stage will be more overlap. So we're now in the early stage of how do you get a few banks to interact with each other about valuable interbank transactions? And we're in the stage of how to DeFi applications interact.
00:01:00.442 - 00:01:04.540, Speaker A: But there's actually a third stage of how do you get them to interact with each other.
