00:00:29.170 - 00:01:00.190, Speaker A: Well, we have a great group of guys here today. You might have seen them at a lot of other events throughout the week at NfTnYC. I'm pretty sure I've seen them on a lot of different headlighting rosters at venues across the city. So we're really lucky to have a great group of people who are, in my view, luminaries within nfts and within the industry at large. So without further ado, we'd just like to introduce Brian, Jesse, and inverted from several different teams across the chainlink ecosystem. I'll hand the mic over to Brian to give a brief background.
00:01:01.810 - 00:01:43.920, Speaker B: Hello. We have two mics taped together. Thought people might want to see that. Brian Trunzo Metaverse lead at Polygon Studios. I come to the Metaverse through a fashion lens, having done trend forecasting for large multinationals, CPG companies, fashion brands. Back in 2017, when cryptokitties had launched, I started cramming NFT information into all of my trend forecasts for multinationals, and that was my backdoor into the space, becoming more and more degenerate over time. So happy to be at Polygon, Polygon Studios, and I'll pass it over here.
00:01:45.490 - 00:02:31.998, Speaker C: Hi, everybody. My name is Jesse Johnson, Golden Cross on Twitter and in the Metaverse, and I am one of the co founders of Avagatchi. Just, yeah, avagatchi Gotchi gang in the house. If you know Ave, the Defi protocol, there's no coincidences there. We use and work with the team at Ave, but we are an independent project that basically has played with the power of working with DFI and NFts and putting them together and some really unique use cases. So our community is a Dow first and foremost, and that unlocks a lot of powerful, kind of amazing things we can do together that you couldn't do in web two. And I think that's what everybody here is about, is what we can do in web3 that we couldn't do before.
00:02:31.998 - 00:02:36.080, Speaker C: So hopefully we can get into some of that today and excited to be here with you all.
00:02:39.330 - 00:02:54.082, Speaker D: Two mics. Love it. All right, inverted Cyberkong CMO. Thank you for having us, by the way, appreciate throwing this, my entry into the metaverse. I like how you use that. 2017 crypto kitties. Having fun with that.
00:02:54.082 - 00:03:03.320, Speaker D: Came in minted some kongs. Had no idea what I was doing. Didn't even know what nfts really were. Today we're here. It's a beautiful thing.
00:03:04.890 - 00:03:05.880, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:03:08.010 - 00:03:31.150, Speaker A: It's funny that you say that because I feel like you probably were in the same discords at some point in 2017. But anyway, here we are, as they're saying. So just to get the conversation started, I think this is officially the second day of nftNYC. And again, I know you all have been all over Manhattan this week, so just to get the conversation started, curious if there's anything that's really stood out to you that you're inspired by, even just within the first day or two of the conference.
00:03:34.930 - 00:04:09.174, Speaker B: Maybe it's my background in trend forecasting. I like to take a step back and zoom out and be a little bit more macro. And it's starting to become reductive to say these words, but they're so true. I feel like everyone in this room has said this at some point in the last couple of days, that the bear is for builders and we needed to trim the trees to let them grow, and the cream is going to rise to the top and the grifters are gone and all that sort of stuff. And that, to me, is actually like, energizing and inspiring more reductive comments that are not my own, but I subscribe to them because I find them to be true. Is in the last bear markets we saw nfts and defi.
00:04:09.222 - 00:04:09.386, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:09.408 - 00:04:23.390, Speaker B: So what's next? What comes out of this bear? Zooming out from the meetings, zooming out from the hoopla and trying to read the tea leaves and understand who's building what. To me, that's invigorating, and that's what I find inspiring.
00:04:24.690 - 00:04:25.246, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:25.348 - 00:04:55.580, Speaker C: I'll just add to that there's so much optimism here at the event, which some may have questioned would be present or not. And because I think what you just said, there's so many builders here and people that are in this for the long run, like everyone probably here, there's no issues, no fud. So it's been pretty good. And always looking for surprises. And I hope I come across a few new potential integrations. We're all here working hard, trying to build things together with the money, legos. So I think we're on the right track.
00:04:56.910 - 00:05:23.460, Speaker D: Yeah, of course. Going third, he stole, you know, of course the people here, it's one of those where I was just at VCON, NFTLA, art basel before that. And it's always a different vibe. Right? Like one of my favorite things. I love the vibe check that's going on NYC last year. Super explosive, right? Everybody was just stoked to be here. Regardless if you're here to flip, to build, to whatever, by the time LA hit a little bit different, feeling going on.
00:05:23.460 - 00:05:33.320, Speaker D: We're back to kind of that feeling now. And like you talk about, I think we're getting to the point where we're back to the people who are here to be here and not just to play here.
00:05:36.170 - 00:05:58.400, Speaker A: And inverted. I think that segues really nicely. So I'll be honest with you, I was not here NFT NYC in the fall, but I know a lot has changed. I know we were all talking about before this conversation started. So I'm just curious, from all of your points of view, what were some observations you had then and what are some things that you and the teams have been observing now over the last about seven months or so?
00:06:01.810 - 00:06:03.200, Speaker C: All right, we'll mix it up.
00:06:03.810 - 00:06:05.038, Speaker A: Yeah, let's try this time.
00:06:05.124 - 00:06:47.326, Speaker C: Okay. So to me, when we look back, like the beginning of this year, the November, I would say that the biggest change for us is there's just more of an awareness that we have to do things with some more forethought and looking forward to building for sustainability. And at Avagatchi, that's something we're very proactive about. We have a fantastic community that is always looking for. I mean, literally we have wearables on our NFTs and they're trying to figure out, like, okay, can we mint more wearables or not? And what's that due for the next five years? I mean, we have 30 year roadmaps, that kind of stuff. So it's been wavy. But I think the volatility is something we're all signed up for when we got here.
00:06:47.348 - 00:06:47.582, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:47.636 - 00:06:49.102, Speaker C: So I'll let you add on to that.
00:06:49.156 - 00:07:23.340, Speaker D: Yeah. I think one of the big things for us is IRL utility. Even things like this is a utility of the space, right? Like we're here sharing, caring and being a part of each other. So, I mean, that's one thing that I know at Kong's. We've definitely hit grown and just changed as far as our place in the space, even who and where and what conferences we're at and what we're doing at those conferences. So a lot of it is, I think, just adopting to what's going on too.
00:07:25.950 - 00:08:08.550, Speaker B: On that utility front, I guess a shout out to Kong's. You guys made a game in that time, right? So to speak, on gaming for a second. We've moved into this second wave of blockchain based games, NFT gaming. And my hope is that we can drop NFT from the word gaming and just talk about gaming, right. That people just so happen to own these assets and there's on chain logic that you can do interesting things with. But I think that that's an interesting and unique difference between this nftnYC and the last one is that I don't have a memory of what was it? I think November, the last NFT NYC of seeing any games at NFTNYC. In March at GDC, game developer conference, all of the energy was around web3.
00:08:08.550 - 00:08:31.550, Speaker B: I mean, web3 gaming basically ate that conference. It had a small footprint, but the energy ate that conference. And there's a lot of that momentum here at Polygon Studios. We're actually having an event tonight right now, I think so many events you can't keep up with Dr. Disrespect, a very famous streamer who is developing his own game studio. Divisive person. So not everyone in the crowd might like Dr.
00:08:31.550 - 00:08:43.220, Speaker B: Disrespect, but his midnight society studio launching on Polygon, he's here, right? That energy wasn't here last NfTNYC, so definitely on the gaming side for sure.
00:08:44.310 - 00:09:10.300, Speaker A: And Brian, I think that energy is something that's always something that's kind of tough to wrangle, right. Because, I mean, in essence, it comes down to community management. And so there's definitely been a lot of big wins, I think, across the broader industry with novel use cases, whether it be around gaming, different types of iterations around nfts. So I'm just curious, from all of your perspectives, how are we striking the balance between these short term wins and obviously, the longer term vision that inspired you guys to get involved in the first place?
00:09:15.010 - 00:09:44.600, Speaker D: Yeah, I think for Cyberkongs, it's one of those where we kind of look at it like a chart. Right? You got green candles and red candles. There's always what you want to do and then what the community wants, and it's not always aligned. And they don't always like what you drop, or they don't know that they like what you drop until it's already out, and then they take the time to explore it. We don't like to listen, nearly read all the time, all that much. We miss instructions, things like that. But it's really just the culmination of it all.
00:09:46.410 - 00:10:21.486, Speaker C: So, in our case, we always knew, like, another bear would come, right? We were kind of born from the bear market. Zbot, my man here, he's the creator of the avagatchi artwork right here in front with the shout out to zbot. Yeah. And we hooked know really defi Summer had passed, and NFTs were just in that kind of primordial stage, and we were on a mission to just build a better crypto pet, right? We were like, I have cryptokitties. We all mentioned those, but I never took them out and checked it out every day. And I was like, well, real pet is something you should pet and care about. So that was the original goal.
00:10:21.486 - 00:11:08.340, Speaker C: Like, can we build a better one? And we got petting on chain, right? We got everybody getting their kinship score up, and then the XP came. Why I mentioned this is we understand the depths of a bear market, and we're fine with that. And the only way to address that is to build a community. And it doesn't happen in a day, right? It's like being in the discord with them, not outsourcing the work and showing up and having complete transparency through the process, so that when that bear market comes, we stick to the mission. And now there's literally thousands of us that are on that same mission, regardless of who got liquidated yesterday or whatever it may be. So, yeah, having that roadmap, and then when you complete a roadmap, make a new roadmap and make sure everybody's on the same page with it.
00:11:09.190 - 00:12:10.790, Speaker B: I think the question had something to do with community, but these guys said some awesome stuff that was community related, not community related. To think about community for a second, something I find interesting is gearing up to cross the chasm, like trying to get to mainstream adoption, and the frictions that will exist between those purists, whether they're crypto anarchists, or those who were just very early to a particular project and help foster the culture of a particular community. Continuing that with inviting new people into the space, I think that's always a delicate balance. It's very easy to be standoffish and snobbish about the community that you hold near and dear to you. And maybe you're not doing that because you are standoffish or because you are snobbish. It can come off that way. So figuring out ways to be inviting to the mainstream, to do things on chain safely, to scale in a responsible way, to understand the limitations of the technology, I think these are interesting frictions that are starting to emerge as we gear up to cross the chasm.
00:12:12.010 - 00:12:56.206, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want to add something really quick to this idea, but we've been thinking about community from day one, but a lot. Especially because you have to requestion yourself when things are on a bearish trend. So one thing is we use the word community all the time, right? When you're on Twitter, you think it gets overused, but there's no better word for it. We are a community. So the one thing that we have to think about is when we're making a web3 game or an NFT project like Kong's or avagatchi, what we are really doing, if it's just we're all on the same telegram waiting for the price to go up or down, that's not really a community. That's the shallowest community you could have. A real community has shared experiences in real life or in the metaverse.
00:12:56.206 - 00:13:31.280, Speaker C: It's got to be shared experiences, memories made, those kind of things. And real relationships built. So that's where the transparency comes in. And then maybe to segue a bit to chainlink. They've been huge for us in creating memorable things because when we have a raffle, that's one of the most popular points where you get hundreds or even thousands of people in the discord together to have a raffle event that is truly on chain and something people can get excited about, win or lose, they participate in a chain link VRF raffle. And that's making memories and experiences together. So I think that's key for community.
00:13:31.280 - 00:13:33.486, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:33.508 - 00:14:10.300, Speaker A: And I think that you bring up a great point around the immersive experiences that are now being created with this new type of blockchain based technology. Right? And so what novel things are growing to provide levels of connectivity, senses of community, through those shared experiences, as you're saying, Jesse. So I'm just curious, as you guys have been going through the iterative process and brainstorming ways to continue to push the envelope, whether it be through utility, whether it be through shared experiences, what are some things that have surprised you or maybe challenged you in the iterative process to continue to push the needle forward for you?
00:14:12.270 - 00:14:38.274, Speaker C: So we have a laundry list of experiences and things we do together with avagatchi. I mean, if it's the Dow, literally every day is something, a debate or an idea being fleshed out. And that is like, building the game is the game, if that makes sense. So we're enjoying it. We're making excel documents fun. So that's where we're at. And the other side is like, chainlink is one of our best ones.
00:14:38.274 - 00:15:19.540, Speaker C: Another example would be they're here in New York this week, is GBM is an amazing team that has basically an english auction system, but they've taken the power of web3 to make the english auction system better. So I bid on an NFT, I put 100, you put 120, I get outbid and I get paid from how much you outbid me by. I get a percent of what you outbid me by. Very powerful stuff you couldn't do in real time without web3. So we're constantly looking for new partners and new innovations in the web3 space like that. And then we're always finding ways to bring that value and that experience to the community. And I'm sure Kongs, I've learned a lot about you guys this week, and you guys definitely have some awesome things like that.
00:15:20.150 - 00:15:45.498, Speaker D: Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you. So, I mean, my background being marketing events, one of my big pushes early on was the IRL experience. So, I mean, we spend hours upon hours, sometimes on discord with either a room full of people or a room full of people or an individual in a. Right. And, like, these moments are cherished. You finally get to meet a lot of the people you've been talking to.
00:15:45.498 - 00:16:14.126, Speaker D: Funny enough, I actually just met some of the council members in New York. This time for the first time. There's nine of us all together. Been working together for 16 months since minting, we'll say. But the iterations, I mean, quality of life, just all of it, I think, comes together for what it means to be the game. Right. And also, I think why we focused on, rather than, I'll say, building our own game is more about being integrated into all games.
00:16:14.126 - 00:16:18.760, Speaker D: So a lot of it has to do with making sure that you have those touch points.
00:16:21.450 - 00:17:04.654, Speaker B: There's so many interesting projects in the space that are using technology in different ways to innovate upon NFTs. And one that came to mind while you guys were talking that Polygon studios helped usher and help build on Polygon, was a partnership between Selfridges, a luxury department store in London who, despite its 200 year heralded history, doesn't have much of a community. People went there to shop, and that was basically it. Paco Raban, a designer whose probably heyday was in the mid century, and his community is like, you know, he's no longer alive. But it's on Instagram, it's on Twitter, it's all over the place. And a museum in Austria, museum Vassarelli. And the core of this project was around dynamic nfts.
00:17:04.654 - 00:17:38.574, Speaker B: Paco Roban had made a collection in the 60s called the unwearables, and it was literally like hyper destroyed clothing. And it was on display at Selfridges. They made these into nfts that gave certain layers of utility to the members of this now Selfridges community that never existed. And the dynamic part of these NFTs was as Muse Vassarelli raised money to restore certain parts of the museum that had been distressed for years. They couldn't raise this money. The NFTs would actually beautify and restore themselves. Right? So it was this beautiful.
00:17:38.574 - 00:17:59.990, Speaker B: The word digital, I feel like it's an overused term. Maybe some people in this room don't hear that term, but for me, it's overused. But it was this digital experience of marrying the real world, allowing brands to collaborate around this new technology. It just felt like a real 360 degree experience that had never been possible, really, and kind of like a win win for the three parties involved.
00:18:01.290 - 00:18:53.400, Speaker A: Well, I'll tell you, digital is a new word for me. So I learned something new tonight. So thank you for that, Brian. But to segue off of that a little bit, Jesse mentioned a little bit around the VRF use case, but just more broadly speaking, when it's kind of like a one to many relationship in terms of managing these communities, managing this utility, managing the expectations know, broadly speaking, even outside of this industry, having transparency and trust in whatever we do is really important because it provides us a sense of assurance in a way of what's happening in our day to day lives. Like, we all seek it out. Right? And so I'm curious, as you guys are navigating these challenges, where does the verification come in? Where does the sense of true randomness come in to these experiences? From your community standpoint, and even from your own standpoint, how do you feel like that's valued by your community?
00:18:56.170 - 00:19:46.950, Speaker C: So with Avagatchi, we immediately knew as soon as we heard about Chainlink VRF, we wanted to use it. And this was before the Avagatchi NFTs had even gone live on the polygon blockchain. So at the time, we had only deployed our governance token for the DAO to kickstart the whole project on ethereum. And so at that time, basically from the six months up till the NFTs went live, it was all about outside of the Dow work, distributing wearables for your avagatchi before the Avagatchis even existed. And we would use the Chainlink VRF to do that. So if you were staking your GhST governance tokens, you had a shot at basically a lossless lottery and pool together. These kind of ideas of win win, lossless activities was very appealing to us.
00:19:46.950 - 00:20:18.658, Speaker C: So it was a single sided staking. There was no lp risk or impermanent loss or any of that. And yet you were able to participate in a three day raffle window where you could come in and cash in your points, your loyalty points for raffle tickets. NFT raffle tickets. And they are extremely popular. And it was the way we distributed the first three rounds of all wearables before the NFTs went live. In fact, the very first round, because it was a chainlink VRF use case, it was our first time using it.
00:20:18.658 - 00:20:36.290, Speaker C: We had some chainlink themed, not official, but Chainlink inspired wearables, like a blue and white plaid shirt. So there are a few avagatchis running around with the Sergey plaid on. And it is ultra rare. If you won that raffle, you're a happy camper.
00:20:36.450 - 00:20:36.870, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:20:36.940 - 00:21:07.060, Speaker C: That is one of the most sought after wearables in the Avagatchi ecosystem. We've continued to do them on polygon. In fact, as soon as you guys deployed chainlink VRF onto Polygon, that was the last step for us to deploy our NFTs on Polygon. We were waiting for that moment. So we use it everywhere we can. Our Gotchi verse went live in Alpha 60 days ago, and we're preparing different ways to integrate VRF into the in real time gameplay of the Gotcha verse. So we'll look forward to more use cases in the near future.
00:21:09.670 - 00:21:48.654, Speaker D: Yeah, very similarly, right? You have the different universes with Cyberkongs. We have our play and collect system, which is a gamified minting experience. Currently in V. One little backstory on Cyber Kongs is we have our original thousand collection. We have a collection of 4000 babies and 15,000 vx. All 4000 babies were not that randomly generated using VRF, but back in the day, generated. And those then basically are what were rewarded to our original holders as part of just everything that was going on in the community.
00:21:48.654 - 00:22:37.466, Speaker D: So what we wanted to do was continue that theme with P and K. Being that it's now today, how do we make sure that randomness is insured? Truth, not trust. Right? That's the best summarization that you can put to it. So for us, it was about if we're going to be advancing how our community is minting our assets rather than us selling them big. Part of that is making sure that there's no way that we've loaded the books that anyone thinks that we've loaded books that there's always honor in the blockchain, whether it's from the event that you get from running a jungle adventure or what item you get when you open a weapons capsule, all of that runs through VRF. And I think within a couple of weeks, we had already done over a million. I don't remember what the number was, but huge number of calls during single runs.
00:22:37.466 - 00:22:51.460, Speaker D: Anyways, it's very important for the cybercom community just because we've always been extremely transparent about what's going on, just like most blockchain stuff. But keeping that aspect is just huge.
00:22:52.630 - 00:23:27.374, Speaker C: Yeah, that real quick reminds me of the other way we use Chainlink VRF, which is the distribution of the nfTs. You want that to be. There's a lot of money at stake, depending on if you get a really rare NFT or a very common one. So you want that as transparent as possible. And VRF helps us achieve that. So the other way we did is as soon as it was deployed on polygon, we were able to use it where it's almost like a deck of cards. You actually mint a portal, you open that magic door with the chain link VRF and inside will be ten randomly generated avagatchis with different traits, and you can only bring one of them to life.
00:23:27.374 - 00:23:48.100, Speaker C: That's the trick. So you got ten choices, and they're almost like piggy banks where you deposit Ave tokens into them to bring them to life. So you get to choose literally by being like, I want the chain link themed avagatchi, and I've got to put $10 worth of link token into it in order to bring it to life. Something like that. So yeah, chain link VRF all over the place.
00:23:49.210 - 00:24:22.518, Speaker B: I just feel like VRF is going to break the brains of gamers who are so used to weird things happening in their games that don't feel all that random at times. For anyone who plays sports games, EA for years have been accused of having some sort of momentum built into their algorithm, where all of a sudden your players just started acting like idiots. And there was nothing random about. It was like programmed into the game. I couldn't smash my baby nephew. Ten nothing in FIFA. I could get to four nothing before all of a sudden my players started acting kind of stupid.
00:24:22.518 - 00:24:30.210, Speaker B: So I could imagine that this was going to be a breakthrough for traditional AAA gaming studios.
00:24:31.270 - 00:24:33.486, Speaker A: We get Mario Kart on the VRF.
00:24:33.678 - 00:24:43.990, Speaker C: Just random thought. Another game like that is Mario Kart. Every time I'm in like 6th, seven, eightharman, I'm like, I need chain link VRF in my Mario Kart.
00:24:45.770 - 00:25:04.426, Speaker A: Yeah, devs do something, right? But no, guys, I think it's just really cool to hear about how your communities are resonating with different types of use, cases of novel technology. Obviously, what it sounds like you guys are excited about as well in terms of the products you're building as well. We covered a lot of ground just.
00:25:04.448 - 00:25:05.306, Speaker B: Now in terms of some of the.
00:25:05.328 - 00:25:13.200, Speaker A: Challenges that you're going through. But I'm just curious across the board here, what are you guys really proud of and excited about right now that you and the team are working on?
00:25:16.530 - 00:26:14.898, Speaker B: I think some of the strides on the education side, at least for Polygon that have been made particularly. I've talked a bit about gaming. I didn't think I would talk this much about gaming today have been tremendous. The media loves to report just how much gamers hate nfts, and I think a large part of that is a suspicion among gamers as to whatever is good for a game studio is bad for me, meaning 20 years of being abused by game studios and they get hardened skinned to anything that seems interesting to a game studio. And I think in the last six months or so, Polygon specifically, but the industry at large has done a really good job of educating game studios and sort of helping them on board to this technology. And the amount of conversations that are happening, most of which behind NDA, of course, with traditional game studios, is just nothing short of tremendous. And it's easy to say these guys don't get it, they're behind the curve, but all of them are researching the space and getting smart to it.
00:26:14.898 - 00:26:32.490, Speaker B: And they understand that if they don't disrupt themselves, they will be disrupted. And I think there's a place for everyone to live in harmony, but it's something I'm very proud of. We hit the circuit and we really do evangelize and educate and onboard new users and new developers. Yeah, I'll just echo that.
00:26:32.640 - 00:27:10.494, Speaker C: We've been so happy on Polygon. Everything has worked out from a technical perspective and also the support you guys give when we get in tough spots or have questions about VRF and how to implement things. I mean, those days happen and it takes not just the tech, but the people working by the human side is also very important. And Polygon has that side and this ecosystem strong. Maybe I could switch instead of talking about our main dev team, Pixel craft, which is what's building out the gotcha verse, our flagship game. The one thing I'm really proud of is actually our community. Having been born as a Dow in a bear market, it takes time for a dow to mature.
00:27:10.494 - 00:27:48.180, Speaker C: We always said that at the start. We actually have a roadmap for the Dao at different phases because you need leadership to step up, you need problems to be solved and people to prove themselves before you can really let it run. And we have multiple games now being developed using avagatchi NFTs that are nothing to do with Pixelcraft Studios. And so I'm encouraging them. Now they're maturing and getting far enough along in the dev cycle where pretty soon they're going to be reaching out to Chainlink and Polygon studios for their own support and integrating some of the features that they need. So super bullish on the gotchi Dow and the community and what they're building.
00:27:49.990 - 00:28:37.186, Speaker D: Yeah, I think for me, one of the biggest things is the interest from web two. And early there was a lot of assumptions and people just kind of came in and did stuff, and now they're realizing that that wasn't necessarily the smartest. So I think the onboarding of web two brands and just IOL brands is a big thing right now. They're dipping their toes. There's a lot of just massive conglomerates that are looking at how do we, in the hotel industry, how do we work this in, in entertainment, in social media, they're all here, even if they're not announcing or on a speaker list or they're there. I think that's the biggest thing that kind of excites me most. And just the continued adoptance on that level, that's huge.
00:28:37.186 - 00:28:42.340, Speaker D: Just the Mastercard news recently was a big thing that pushes the whole space forward.
00:28:45.990 - 00:29:16.720, Speaker A: I appreciate the perspective, guys. And just to take a big step back, we got a good amount of people here in the audience today, probably at varying different levels of understanding of what VRF may be, what blockchain is. Some people may be super sophisticated, some people might be, this could be their first event. So I'm just curious, from all of your perspectives, we were talking even before this conversation, right, about how long you've been in the game for. Just curious, what steps did you take to get started? I think we were talking about 2017, so it's years ago.
00:29:18.290 - 00:30:03.050, Speaker B: I think just the technology is permissionless, but so is your access to it, meaning you could just immerse yourself in this stuff and jump right in. And I would encourage anyone in this space, no matter how deep you are, just to keep going. The rabbit hole never stops. And if you find conviction in this, and if you're in this room, I would imagine you have some level of conviction in this web3 crypto at large just to keep going and immerse yourselves. And even if you're an introverted person, force yourself to be extroverted, actually inverted. And myself, we're just talking about being closet introverts, although we look like extroverts at times. So, yeah, just immerse yourself in it and continue to be curious.
00:30:04.190 - 00:30:22.622, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you summed it up. So basically, for me, I'm always telling my friends, if you really want to check it out, start at Twitter. Actually, it won't take any of your money, and it's a free app and it has a lot of entertainment at the very least. So if you can follow a few people, that's a good spot to start. And then maybe graduate to discord.
00:30:22.686 - 00:30:23.010, Speaker D: Right.
00:30:23.080 - 00:30:24.500, Speaker C: And then go from there.
00:30:25.590 - 00:30:45.686, Speaker D: I think my big thing would be take chances. I think we're all kind of where we are here today, even being in this room today, everybody present, because you're wanting to and willing to. I mean, there's still millions of people who have no idea what most of these words are. That's part of anything. It's just like taking the rabbit hole.
00:30:45.718 - 00:30:46.300, Speaker C: Right?
00:30:49.230 - 00:31:06.900, Speaker A: And just to close out one last question, knowing what you've done over the last several years, is there anything you'd do differently? Experientially. I'm not talking about like a rug you could have avoided, but steps that you took that you're like, maybe I could have learned this a little bit quicker or in a different way.
00:31:08.390 - 00:31:27.606, Speaker B: I would have cared less about toilet paper in March of 2020 and more about buying that dip. We were staring at a global pandemic. We thought we were going to die. Right. So if you didn't buy enough of that dip, you've been forgiven by all of us, I guess. But, yeah, I'm going to stick with the joke. I'm not going to get serious on that one.
00:31:27.606 - 00:31:28.680, Speaker B: I'm going to pass this.
00:31:29.530 - 00:31:45.470, Speaker C: It's a good one. Tough act to follow. No? I don't know. Just be careful. And obviously, like all the rules, don't put in more than you're willing to lose. I think mentorship has a big place in things. So find somebody that's already in the space, maybe they're not.
00:31:45.470 - 00:32:01.060, Speaker C: First degree of separation is not your best friend, but find somebody online, even, that you can follow and ask questions to. So that applies to so many things in life. But even web3, getting a good mentor and someone who isn't going to get wrecked or get you wrecked on the first day is a good idea.
00:32:01.830 - 00:32:02.146, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:02.168 - 00:32:24.060, Speaker D: I'm going to go back to taking just more chances. I mean, it's one of those where even just before nftnyC, someone had a gallery, for example, had followed me and followed back, sent a Twitter message. We had a meeting today. The idea of just putting yourself out there more, again, talks about the extroverted introverts. Yeah, that's probably the biggest thing.
00:32:27.070 - 00:32:27.386, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:32:27.408 - 00:32:51.662, Speaker A: And all these guys, Chainlink, ourselves included, we all have great communities on Discord, telegram, Twitter to all the points above here. So if you're trying to get involved, obviously those are great platforms to get started. But just, I guess. Jamie, do we have enough time for questions? Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, we could open up the floor to questions if you guys are cool with it. Should we hand it or yell?
00:32:51.806 - 00:32:52.930, Speaker E: We can repeat the question.
00:32:53.000 - 00:32:55.940, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I guess. Okay.
00:32:57.930 - 00:33:26.350, Speaker E: My name is Richie Studios. We're very much in early stages trying to get game development with metaverse, and even when we get started in sandbox. So is there a way you guys would kind of recommend a direction to kind of have people be incentivized to earn tokens, but you also want to start mad toast tokens and then just where would you be getting the gaming process? Off the ground?
00:33:28.290 - 00:33:39.300, Speaker A: Yeah. So just for the people in the back, the question was, in short, if I got you, how do we get the game process started in the blockchain sense?
00:33:41.270 - 00:34:03.494, Speaker B: I used the word reductive a few times, and forgive me, I'm going to say it again, this might sound reductive, but make a fun game. Make it fun. A lot of games in web3 are just not fun. It's not. It feels more like a grind than a game. There are different types of games, there are different types of people who have different definitions of fun. But I would focus on the game first before you focus on the tokenomics.
00:34:03.494 - 00:34:07.420, Speaker B: That's a very general piece of advice, but I really, really believe that.
00:34:08.750 - 00:34:09.740, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:34:12.270 - 00:34:47.014, Speaker C: So, on our side, we started as a dow, so as a Dao building games, and we kind of have two products. We have the Avagatchi itself, which is like a tamagotchi. It's an intrinsic game just having, by virtue of having. That was the first game. And then now we're building out the Gotcha verse, a much more ambitious venture that's required us to hire. We've grown to over 40 people now full time at Pixelcraft. Former CTO of Coin market cap and their former CPO are building out the back end so that we can have thousands of avagatchis playing in real time across the world at the same exact time.
00:34:47.014 - 00:35:37.702, Speaker C: And that takes a huge investment on our side and the Dow. And so the reason I mentioned both in this context is if you're going to be building out and you want your community to help you build, then you have to build a game a that is going to attract the type of people that have the talent to participate and actually bring value. So they can't just be speculators, they can't even just be players, they can be in the mix. But you want to, like in our case, we don't run away from blockchain, we don't abstract it away. So we've been fortunate that we've kind of attracted a certain type of community that is full of developers and solidity experimenters and people that want to build. And so that's why we're very confident to delegate basically responsibility to the community. Like they've built over a dozen minigames, they're building out bigger games now.
00:35:37.702 - 00:35:48.806, Speaker C: And it's always a walk before you run kind of thing, but you want to set them up for success and you want to be building something that's going to attract the type of people that you need to build with you.
00:35:48.908 - 00:35:50.826, Speaker D: So that's what I would suggested.
00:35:50.938 - 00:35:51.600, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:53.570 - 00:36:17.410, Speaker D: I'm going to follow up and just say the same thing. Fun first. I mean that's the biggest thing. We all play games in some fashion, but we all play them for a reason, right? And in the end, money should not be the reason, then it's a job. So it's like you can either go to work or you can have fun. Not that you can't do both at the same time, but the mentality there, right? And you'll have people who min max. Right.
00:36:17.410 - 00:36:44.334, Speaker D: We're all, I think big on that. Right. That's why some of us are here. So the idea that if you put the focus on that, that's who you will attract. So integration is also huge, right? Like it's the metaverse, decentralized. Obviously you guys will have your own characters and things like that, but let others bring their favorites in. That's a big one that I know some companies are hesitant on, but also we want some.
00:36:44.334 - 00:36:51.710, Speaker D: In my opinion, you blow the doors wide open. You want people in your space, not necessarily in your character suit.
00:36:55.430 - 00:36:57.634, Speaker A: Awesome. Great question. Anyone else?
00:36:57.672 - 00:37:36.730, Speaker E: Yeah, follow up. Working with couple of developers and they have, and they kind of get interested in creating items. These are no capacity. What would be the step one? Would be maybe a strong path. Step one for trading.
00:37:39.330 - 00:37:44.794, Speaker A: So like the preliminary steps to get started building a game basically on chains.
00:37:44.842 - 00:37:52.180, Speaker E: And currently have a number of user base that they open and we try to scale it.
00:37:55.510 - 00:37:56.420, Speaker A: Got you.
00:38:00.870 - 00:38:01.950, Speaker E: To get to there.
00:38:02.040 - 00:38:03.590, Speaker A: So building for scale.
00:38:11.770 - 00:38:23.770, Speaker E: What would be the easy step or soft? Because they don't have the capacity to either learn if there is some sort of service or AI.
00:38:24.110 - 00:39:12.470, Speaker C: Yeah, basically, if you're a game developer traditionally, and you're saying he's asking if they can, the question is if he's got or knows of game developers that want to get into web3 and play to earn gaming, maybe something like that. But they don't have the time or opportunity to invest into learning it themselves. The web3 side. So I would just say I'm a big advocate of work to learn. We've had multiple people in our dow who were probably very basic tech savvy, and now they are learning solidity and teaching themselves and jumping in to build these minigames. And so I think just work to learn and that mentorship comes back into play. Join a team like avogadchi Dow we are building games every day.
00:39:12.470 - 00:39:17.390, Speaker C: Send them our way. We got web two gamers that are building web3 games all the time.
00:39:17.540 - 00:39:18.494, Speaker D: You kill it. Yeah.
00:39:18.532 - 00:39:19.214, Speaker E: Okay.
00:39:19.412 - 00:39:25.390, Speaker B: You could also call Polygon studios if you want to deploy on Polygon. We'll help you out and give you counsel and advice.
00:39:28.610 - 00:39:33.440, Speaker A: That sounds like a good answer for upon itself. Yeah, good question.
00:39:35.370 - 00:39:36.120, Speaker E: It.
00:39:39.690 - 00:39:40.440, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:44.010 - 00:39:52.890, Speaker E: One that's here to say one in the future. There are so many buzwords.
00:39:58.910 - 00:40:08.560, Speaker A: So like, what makes a strong business plan? Yeah, good question.
00:40:12.130 - 00:40:17.620, Speaker D: I chuckle a little bit because anyone who tells you an answer, in my opinion, doesn't know.
00:40:18.630 - 00:40:19.394, Speaker C: Oh, I'm sorry.
00:40:19.432 - 00:40:54.122, Speaker D: Yeah, the question was, it just caught me off guard. The question is, what's a good business plan for web3 and how to get into the space and things like that, if I understood right with nfTs. So for me, anyone who tells you we don't have enough data yet, there's no way to know what's going to work, what's not going to work. You can see some models that have obviously worked. There's stuff that works. But as far as duration, timeline, expiration date, nfts, crypto could all be dead in ten years. So it's one of those where it's so hard to even attempt to answer that question.
00:40:54.122 - 00:41:43.040, Speaker D: But I think the biggest things to look for is trends are always going to be popular, right? But getting ahead of the trend. So seeing where things are going, so people are talking about metaverses for Kong's, one of our big aha. Moments was everybody wants to build their own game, let them, let's put our stuff in their game instead. So things like that, I feel like, if you can kind of get ahead of the game is really the best answer, but that's always a fun one that I love to just kind of crack on just because it's like there is no real answer, there is no tried and true methods. Personally, I think there's not enough data out there yet. Right. Even if you go with cryptokitties and punks, we're only, what, seven years deep on all that and very little data for the first five to six.
00:41:43.040 - 00:41:50.240, Speaker D: I would love to see an analyst take on, like, okay, let's see which business plans work here and there and all that, but. Good question. Definitely.
00:41:51.970 - 00:41:52.382, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:52.436 - 00:42:40.142, Speaker C: So what business models work for crypto and web3, right? Something like with gaming specifically? Hard to say. I think play to earn does have some black eyes with tokenomics, so many play to earn tokens have just been decimated, especially recently. And so I think they probably, at this point, have a worse reputation than the defi farming tokens. The Gamefi farming is in a rough spot, but it's okay. It's iterative. And I think with us, we're looking at ways to design for sustainability, and I can't go into how the models all work, but there's a need to find solutions to this stuff that sustainability should be at the front of any project you're looking at. And so there's a lot of examples of things that don't work.
00:42:40.142 - 00:43:19.180, Speaker C: We all know what's not working and there's tons of red flags to look out for. And then once you eliminate that, you can shortlist down to a few things that might work and are kind of working and are working well. If I give you one example, the Avagatchi Kickstarter kick started basically as a dow using a bonding curve. So that might be another new term for some here, depending how into web3 you are. But a token bonding curve is a very powerful option to consider if you're building a community in web3. Basically, it's been one of the best decisions we made two years ago, and it works in bull markets, it works in bear markets and protects your community. So that's one thing to check out.
00:43:21.730 - 00:43:28.846, Speaker A: All right, cool. I think we could leave it there. Everyone, really appreciate all coming out today. We have to give a round of.
00:43:28.868 - 00:43:29.550, Speaker B: Applause.
00:43:32.210 - 00:44:04.086, Speaker A: And really want to thank all of the guests for coming out, evangelizing for what's really happening in the industry on the ground level. Really appreciate all the perspectives and all the insights for the audience here. So just for everyone here, we have more events. Jamie's our guy. If you're in the New York area, we'll be around foreseeably. And we have a big awesome event in September called Smartcon, so feel free to check it out online. We have a lot of other guests, like these guys and other luminaries in the space, so feel free to check it out.
00:44:04.086 - 00:44:08.280, Speaker A: We'd love to see you. And again, thanks for coming out. My name is Harris. Thank you.
00:44:10.450 - 00:44:48.980, Speaker E: You got me. Love me. Don't be happy. Don't be.
