00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.910, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:01.060 - 00:00:45.546, Speaker B: Hey everybody. I guess I am. We are live and excited to be back for hackathon chain link spring 2023. And yeah, this is our third hackathon with chain link and we're super excited. We've already had 80 plus projects building on top of truthlation and the data that we provide. Um, we are and have started off in providing real world and economic data on chain in the form of an inflation index. Today we now have a dashboard where you can go to trueflation.com
00:00:45.546 - 00:01:34.298, Speaker B: and you will be able to see all of the types of inflation calculations that we have out there. Man, my mouse is really slow. You can see this here, let me share this tab so you can see on our website what we track. We have both us data and UK data, and basically you can see all the breakdowns. We have twelve categories for which that data is available today. This is all publicly available for everybody to see. You see the breakdown on how it works and the subcategories are coming soon.
00:01:34.298 - 00:02:14.710, Speaker B: What are the subcategories? You basically then get more insights into the depth associated, let's say, with the housing inflation. How much of that is in owned and rented. So if you're renting a property, you're actually only seeing over last year, you're seeing an increase of about 1% of your rent. Obviously, beginning of the year it was much higher. But again, you just get to see all of this. On our site today in the US we have 3.9. Remember, the national BLS number is 5%.
00:02:14.710 - 00:03:13.258, Speaker B: So we differ. Why are we different? We're different because we actually have multiple sources. We are real time and we track 18 million items versus the 60 to 80,000 that the governments track manually with 477 people. And that's why we're different. And we believe we need to be different and be able to hold a different set of independent source of truth, very much aligned with the motto with Chainlink. And so we're super excited to be a partner with Chainlink. Not only do we do a dashboard where you can see what inflation is, you have a personal calculator here, so you can actually go and calculate your own inflation by putting in your income and then, or where your average expenditure is.
00:03:13.258 - 00:04:05.018, Speaker B: Our goal with this calculator, for which we launched two weeks ago and have some 4000 submissions already, we are looking to integrate credit card data with this. We're looking to integrate your zero accounting, your quickbooks, your expensify solutions, so that ultimately you can know your household inflation, your personal inflation. But even that, for your small business or your greater business. And that's sort of what we're looking to expand around that area. But the area that we're really also excited about is in this area. This is still an MVP. But here you can see our marketplace for commodities and other sort of climate related data, and you can then see how that works.
00:04:05.018 - 00:05:26.342, Speaker B: But before I go into that, yeah, welcome everybody to the hackathon. And I just wanted to reiterate for new joiners coming in that we're excited to be a partner for this. And we are looking and have put together $15,000 in prize money for developers to help with some ideas around the data that we have. If this is your first time to the hackathon, this is the first time you're here of trueflation. I walk through a bit of our site and what we do, but let me just give you a quick idea of where we're at and who truflation is. We really are believing that the data matters and how do we get this data in real time, particularly performance data associated with the economy and with our financial environment? How do we provide that in a transparent fashion, and how do we make it on chain so it becomes immutable and censorship resistant and also available to all of you to work on this. Why are we doing this? A lot of people asking us, why are we in this data space? And I don't know if you can read the font, but they're super small in my screen.
00:05:26.342 - 00:06:42.270, Speaker B: But basically, in summary today, data is just inefficient. They're built on very old models that haven't been and seen any innovation since 1950. The biggest innovation around making data available and aggregating. That has come through Reuters. When Reuters first started and they've scaled down to Thomson Reuters, they've acquired a lot of companies, but they were the first sort of idea to really innovate around data. And subsequently, you've had a lot of boutiques come up, boutique firms that have then subscribed to Reuters or tried to pull alternative data sets together, shrink wrap them into a nice report, have them sent out to the various participants or customers that pay anywhere up to $20,000 a month, or if not more, for either a standardized reporting that they get on a monthly basis, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for customized, unique research element. And this all in the sense of having a bit of a competitive advantage against your peers or against the market.
00:06:42.270 - 00:07:54.174, Speaker B: More importantly, how do I win in this market, and what can I do to win in this market and get a competitive advantage to make a bet ahead of what the market will do and what the market sentiment is. The data is historically very intransparent, so you don't know how they calculate it unless you're getting on a call with a specific analyst and going through that. They're very centralized, so they're done in cloaky dark rooms where decisions are made and set forth. And then ultimately you need at least a $2,000 a month bill in order to access some of these data sets. And in essence, that you're paying $2,000 for just the simple aggregation of that data into a shrink wrapped black screen with a funky keyboard. And so ultimately, those were all the reasons where we felt we can provide a significant improvement in the innovating in this field. We do this really targeting at three different customer segments, the tradfi segment, the DeFi segment, and the traders, day traders.
00:07:54.174 - 00:08:53.270, Speaker B: We want to have as many independent investors and participants that are looking for data and making their decisions and educating them on how the data is constructed. What are the breakdowns of those data sets, and then what is the composition of the overarching umbrella and the underlying data sets that are in there. So again, if you go back to true CPI, you will see in here that we actually have share this tab instead. You can actually see we have the overarching umbrella of inflation. How much is that? You then have the twelve categories. Underneath that, you can go to the housing sector. You see this is 23.2%
00:08:53.270 - 00:09:29.154, Speaker B: of the overall expenditure. That is 23.2% apart of the overall inflation, whereas food and beverage is 15.3% of the overall. So just trying to educate more and more, and we're getting more and more granular in this as we evolve. And we will be bringing in weather data, commodity data and all of that in here. That's sort of the sort of go to market and sort of why we want to really go after this.
00:09:29.154 - 00:11:03.146, Speaker B: And we see a huge economic impact to break away from the tradfi and really help the DeFi category as well as the day traders who want to engage in this, or some of us may call them dgens, or the distributed and decentralized generation. And so how do we work with them and how do we scale this? Yeah, and we are learning from the tradfi markets what their requirements are, how do they interpret it, what sort of data sets do they look for to be able to then offer that up through to the Defi segments and customer bases that we work with and traders, we have some really interesting customers and some really innovative developments that are taking place around this. From the last two hackathons, right, we had lottery examples associated with trueflation. We had prediction markets come up on chain prediction markets. We had the development of synthetic assets related to housing information. Just some examples of the previous participants and previous winners of the last hackathons that we've been involved with. Why is this important to us and what are we looking for going forward? A part of inflation is the cost of raw material associated with the final product cost that you then purchase.
00:11:03.146 - 00:12:38.474, Speaker B: Be it a car, be it a product that you buy in the supermarket, or even the coffee that you buy at Starbucks, or the food that gets served on the table at a restaurant. All of those elements have certain sets of ingredients that feed up into this. So about six weeks, six months ago, sort of, Joseph and Cameron and the rest of the team have really been working on bringing real world assets information onto the chain. What does that mean? That means issues like your commodities that can include soy, wheat, coffee, anything in that area that is impacted by that, when that gets shipped coffee from Brazil to the US, I need container, I need to know the supply chain. But also the crop of coffee is highly dependent on the performance of weather. How does the weather impact it? What is the wage situation now all of a sudden that coffee comes to the US? I have real estate costs that I need for the Starbucks outlets. How is real estate costs impacting the price of coffee at a Starbucks? How are the salaries impacting that cost as well? So ultimately, over time, we've started to aggregate a whole set of additional underlying fundamental information that feeds up into the components, and then feeds up into the subcategories, into the categories, and then ultimately into CPI.
00:12:38.474 - 00:15:04.140, Speaker B: What is today CPI, and possibly even what could it look like into the future? How can we leverage certain, given the historical data that we have, some ten years worth of historical data, how can we leverage that to start forecasting into the future what certain price points will look like? And how can that then be leveraged by the community to then better make investment decisions? Our goal is to enable everybody a 30 x improvement of the data sets that are out there already today. And how can you make your decisions better every single day? Because that improvement of a decision making process every single day results in a compounded benefit that has every day that adds up to being a 365 time improvement to what you have. That's sort of where we've come from, where our thinking is, and where we want and are working around this hackathon, and how we're pulling this together, but our big thing is, now that we have a lot of this fundamental data, how do we make these tradable and how do we build great price points around this? We've got an outline here in terms of what we're looking for in this hackathon. And there are sort of really sort of a couple of things where we feel, I don't know if you can see the screen, but maybe I'll zoom in a little bit so you can actually read it. We're just really looking out to help tokenize a lot of these assets. How do we create synthetic tokens associated with commodity prices? You're seeing oil is already being commoditized and tokenized, right? So the price of oil, price of shares we've seen in the past be set up as synthetics on chain. How can we build more of those? How can we create more of those with the commodity prices that we have? We see commodities trading being a very exclusive, far away, distant, highly, very complex to approach opportunity.
00:15:04.140 - 00:15:56.922, Speaker B: So how can we democratize that? How can we make that available to as many people as possible? And so we've looked at trying to offer that up. What do those look like? One of the things is how do we enable 24/7 pricing? Today the pricing associated with commodities is open during office hours, right trading days, right trading hours. It's not 24/7 in crypto. We live in 24/7 land. What does that mean? How do we make these pricing? Where the volume today is, how do we make that 24 of seven available? What does that pricing look like? Imagine you close at Friday at 04:00 p.m. And Monday at 10:00 a.m. It opens up again over the weekend.
00:15:56.922 - 00:16:51.680, Speaker B: What does the pricing look like? If we want to have 24/7 pricing, how do we make that available and how can we create that? Why is this important? It's really important. Number one is because on a Sunday, the OPEC, for example, will announce that they're reducing the barrel productions by 1 million barrels a day. They reduce their oil production. That has a significant impact on the price of oil. And the decentralized generation wants to enter in on a Sunday and buy oil futures or oil synthetics. As a token, anybody should be able to participate in that opportunity. And then on Monday or Tuesday sell that.
00:16:51.680 - 00:17:58.054, Speaker B: The flip side can also happen. And that's why the next category is really important, a delta neutral hedging for this commodities. So imagine you've actually added collateral into a trading platform. That trading platform has now got your collateral and enables you to trade, maybe even long and short. So you don't only trade spot, you also trade futures. And as a part of that trading in the future, when the market shifts significantly today, where the volume is in the fiat world, how do I make sure that I don't get all my customers get liquidated over a weekend whilst the pricing deviates between the Sunday and the Monday opening price at a significant bar or margin. And if that arbitrage is too big, a lot of the investors in the synthetic area will lose value, either be liquidated or gain a significant value.
00:17:58.054 - 00:19:09.820, Speaker B: But then the protocol loses significantly or the counterparties lose significantly. So how can we build out a delta neutral pricing strategy over weekends? So that at some point you are hedged against what you're experiencing between a real market and a synthetic market until the volume starts to balance out and then you have a sort of more equal playing field. And so what would that look like? How do we build that out and what would the thought process be? There are already a lot of thinking that has gone into this. You can check out Opyn and their squeeze protocol, s q u e e t h using opyn. Or look at the stablecoin called uxd. So UXD also has a delta neutral pegging strategy. So there are some inspirations there on how to work with that.
00:19:09.820 - 00:19:41.480, Speaker B: Why are we doing this? Why are we really excited about this? So the risk threshold of a hedge. So I'm reading some of the questions here from Yumi. Awesome. How about other currencies? Can you clarify what you mean by other currencies? You mean Fx rates? And Joseph, do we have FX rates in our marketplace as well?
00:19:43.770 - 00:21:01.070, Speaker A: We have FX rates in marketplace right now. It's one of those things is that one of the things that we're interested in is to see where the demand is, because it takes a bit of work to get data sources and to get good data sources. But if it turns out that there's a huge demand for particular piece of data that's not on there, then this is part of the reason we're doing the hackathon. So if you actually want to do FX, our system is designed so that once you've built your smart contract against one asset or against inflation, then as we add new stuff, you don't have to change your code. So if you look at the list of financial indices and FX stuff, and if it's something that we don't have, then you can build your smart contract, gets their protocol, and then we'll see about getting it. But we're really interested in seeing what the demand is out there. And if there are lots of people out there that want FX, then that's a sign for us to go out and get the data and put it on the chain.
00:21:05.110 - 00:21:22.806, Speaker B: Yeah. I hope that answers your question, Yumi. Evan Piro, you ask sort of the risk threshold of hedge contract would be provided by a trueflation oracle. Yeah, I was referring to FX rate. Yeah.
00:21:22.828 - 00:21:23.720, Speaker A: Okay, perfect.
00:21:24.170 - 00:21:58.130, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's ultimately what we're trying to do, right? Yeah. So the oracle provides and can offer the offset to a lot of that risk and that exposure and enables the hedging. I'm just going to share some links in here with Sophia just to sort of be able to give you some idea of some of the protocols that are offering this hedging and these delta neutral strategies, yet enabling upside.
00:21:59.910 - 00:22:52.850, Speaker A: So the situation with Defi and hedging and derivatives, it's really exciting because no one knows exactly how to do this, but the first person who does it right, is going to make a ton of money. So the thing that we're working on is this is a huge problem. There are lots of people that are doing different parts of it. The thing that we're focused on is providing data. So we're providing data. We've got an infrastructure for giving your data, and then we want to watch you just take the data and make money. And how the hedging strategy works or what strategies work and what doesn't, that's something that nobody quite knows.
00:22:52.850 - 00:22:57.378, Speaker A: And it's really exciting because when people don't know what's going on, then there's.
00:22:57.394 - 00:23:50.134, Speaker B: Money to be made to figure it's the we. Exactly like Joseph said, right. There's a lot of potential in this market. And if you look at what the value is of real world assets, there's a really great report out there by Citibank that have done one on the tokenization of illiquid assets. And there's another one that's been done by Boston Consulting Group where they claim it's $16 trillion by 2030. And all of those are going to be assets that get tokenized, or illiquid assets that are going to get tokenized. And I don't think any of them take into account the concept around synthetic assets in a decentralized finance world.
00:23:50.134 - 00:25:02.160, Speaker B: And if you look at the potential of DFI, DFI alone today has a rough market size of around $20 billion in market cap, sort of $15 to $20 billion all the D five protocols in terms of revenue that they're running through, not their market cap, sorry, their revenue and floats that they have on their network. That is anticipated to go to about 250,000,000,000 by the end, by 2030. And so that's a significant, that's a huge growth number. 20 x maybe? No, not quite 20 x, maybe 15 x over the course of the next four to five years. And that's the opportunity at hand. And you can see in this graph here, I don't know if you can see these logos here, but there are lots of companies building out in the perpetuals and the futures trading capability. They're building out options and derivatives, they're creating synthetic assets and they're enabling off the back of that different types of structured products.
00:25:02.160 - 00:26:35.030, Speaker B: There's a whole industry that's burgeoning and beginning to grow in this area. Right? Why? Because it's so hard to get access to it. If you're a small evanium business and you're dependent on coffee or sugar or wheat as a product for you, how do you get it? How can you hedge yourself against sways in the price or breakouts in difficulties in delivery around fertilization instrument that's going to drive up the price of wheat? And you're a bakery and you need to rely on that, or you're struggling with lithium supply for your batteries, for all the EV cars in order to maintain your supply contract for the next five years with Tesla, for example. How do you ensure what that is? And who do you call? You call your buddy, who knows somebody who's in New York, who then knows somebody who's in Chicago, who then knows somebody who has the license to trade on an exchange. So all of those become really complicated and convoluted and lots expensive processes with multiple middlemen that all want a piece of the action along the way. And so how do we democratize this, make this more peer to peer and provide a unique source of truth that all of these oracles and services can rely on and thereby creating a unique pricing feature, a hedging option? All of these things that we've been talking about are going to be really important to this ecosystem. Ultimately.
00:26:35.030 - 00:27:26.374, Speaker B: We want to make it robust, we want to make it affordable, and we want to make that real time. Right? Those are things that we are aspiring to do and our teams are working to make all of that possible. And so those are things that we really see interesting. And you can find a lot of the resources that we've made available here on this share this tab on this blog post that's posted up here, the trueflation.com blog chain link 23 hackathon. We have a GitHub repo that you can all access to be able to identify how to get started. It's a quick start guide.
00:27:26.374 - 00:27:53.570, Speaker B: You have a YouTube demonstration with tutorials, smart contracts. You have a testing environment as, yeah. So you can then just really launch this on Ethereum, Gurley, on Chainlink's faucet, et cetera. So a lot of this is already set up for you and really trying to make it easy to get started. Okay, here we go. Lots of questions. Whoops.
00:27:53.570 - 00:28:47.154, Speaker B: What's the potential? Yeah, I hope I identified the market cap potential for Defi. I'm happy to share a couple of links to the reports. One is, as I mentioned, there's a Citibank report on actually the tokenization of real world assets. There's a Boston consulting group, but if you go to Google and search those, you'll find those. And then if you do a decentralized finance market report and scope, there's one out there put together by grand view research, I think it's called, or something. But yeah, they've put out a report in terms of how big that market is. Thanks for your work triplation providing.
00:28:47.154 - 00:29:05.174, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. Palm sivet. Yeah, really cool. Yeah, we like what we do. We're really passionate about democratizing a lot of this data and making it available to everybody to build on. And yeah, we think it needs an independent source of truth.
00:29:05.174 - 00:30:20.610, Speaker B: And how do we put that source of truth on chain? How do we provide the governance and the engagement models associated with that truth on chain as well, so that people can interact with that data and build out funky cool new products. How do you build new synthetic BT? How do you build new synthetic assets with trueflation? There are a number of ways to do that. Maybe a good example would be to look at either. You can go to nuon fi, which is a synthetic asset pegged to the cost of living, where basically there's a collateral hub. You build a vault that allows a smart contract, that allows people to stake their tokens as collateral against the value associated with a synthetic. What is that synthetic? And then you take the oracle feed for the price and you do a proportion of it. You do the whole price.
00:30:20.610 - 00:31:17.734, Speaker B: What is the price of a kilogram of rice? A kilogram of rice is, let's say 100. So I need 120 worth of collateral in the vault. Why 120? Because that collateral needs to be higher in the event that the price jumps highly quickly and you do not have enough collateral backing your value of the actual synthetic, you either need to liquidate or you either need to make sure there's enough buffer in the collateral hub. People don't like to get liquidated. However, there is the opportunity to generate fees associated with liquidation. So a lot of the protocols actually generate fees associated with the collateral. Yeah, I don't know.
00:31:17.734 - 00:31:19.558, Speaker B: Joseph, do you want to add anything to that?
00:31:19.644 - 00:32:20.630, Speaker A: Yeah, so one of the nice things about Ethereum is that there's a lot of code that's out there. So a lot depends on what level you're at. And the nice thing about hackathons is that you meet other people. So what I'd recommend is try to figure out what you're comfortable with, start on discord, meet other people and start talking about ideas. So one of the things that you want to start doing, and I find this is useful, is start with a need, right? So you start with, I'm a coffee farmer, I run a coffee shop. I want to hedge the price of coffee so that I don't get hit if the price of coffee goes up. So where you'd start is you'd start with a need or something that you think would be useful.
00:32:20.630 - 00:33:50.438, Speaker A: And then you find somebody who's better at coding, and then you start creating teams, and then you build that up. So one place I'd start looking is just go on the various protocols where people have actually created synthetic assets using the Ethereum blockchain. And if you feel comfortable with the smart contract, you can adapt it to fit the truth. If that's too much stuff, then you can start with a simple hello world contract and just put in bits and pieces for where you need assistance in adding features and functionality. The mindset in doing the hackathon is the main thing that we're interested in is just new ideas and new use cases. So you should focus on that. And then one of the other nice things about hackathon is that there's some people that love coding, there's some people that hate coding, there's some people that want to learn more coding, and you get to meet interesting people, and you find people that know stuff that you want to learn, and you find that you know stuff that they want to learn.
00:33:50.438 - 00:34:09.820, Speaker A: And so that's the main thing about hackathons, is just to create communities. I approach it from that point of view. Just start with an idea and then see who in the community is interested in that idea and just roll with it.
00:34:13.170 - 00:34:34.180, Speaker B: Yeah. And then palm sivet. You're asking what's the best way for me to use inflation data in a smart contract? Should I be calling on triplation contract for my own contract, or should I be using the chain link functions to connect to your API or something entirely different?
00:34:34.630 - 00:35:02.750, Speaker A: Okay. If you start with Quickstart, Quickstart is a sample smart contract that calls trueflation data. And one of the things that we've done is behind the scenes, it's calling trueflation code. So we've put all the trueflation code in the quick start. So if you just copy that, you'll be calling trueflation through chainlink.
00:35:04.770 - 00:35:27.780, Speaker B: Yeah. And the quick start is what you're seeing here on the screen in the GitHub repo. Right. So here's a link, and then also on the blog post, you'll see a lot of references to where you can go. Here's a quick start. GitHub repo, you can do testers. So you have got all the necessary links that you need.
00:35:29.110 - 00:36:32.780, Speaker A: So the powerful thing about the truflation data system is that once you've got a contract that connects with trueflation data, then you can start using your imagination, saying, okay, I want to do something with other economic data. I want to do something with price of coffee or price of oil. And we have provided on the quickstart some existing data. But if it turns out that it's something that you're interested in and we don't provide the data, then the nice thing about our interface is that you can just put in a wish list. You can get the price of, I don't know, martian rocks from truflation, and then you can work on creating a synthetic contract on martian rocks and then contacted us, and we'll get you the data. So just use your imagination. If it's something that we don't have, we'll get for you.
00:36:35.550 - 00:37:04.174, Speaker B: Great. And Frost, Corialis, you're asking about to use dynamic NFTs for synthetic assets. Yeah, for sure. That would be an amazing feature. Right. And I think that's a visualization of your synthetic asset. What's the balance? What's the status of that every single time? And if you can do that in a cool design, it automatically becomes a tradable asset on a opensea blur or any of those platforms.
00:37:04.174 - 00:37:11.350, Speaker B: Right. And that would be amazing to see that. Yeah, go ahead, Joseph.
00:37:12.250 - 00:37:52.530, Speaker A: The amazing thing about Defi and Chainlink and all this stuff is that there's so much stuff to do. So just use your imagination, and there's so many people that will be needed in order to create. We're literally creating a new world. And I can't do it by myself, Stefan can't do it by. Well, none of us can do it by ourselves. But just imagine the new world and we'll all dig together to get to reach just. It's absolutely amazing the amount of stuff that the possibilities, the software and the new technology provides.
00:37:52.530 - 00:38:32.640, Speaker A: And one thing I love about these hackathons is that people come up with ideas. The last time I think we had a hackathon, it was really difficult for us to pick winners because we had so many amazing, great ideas. And that's the hard part about these hackathons, is that you see so many ideas that need to be pushed forward. But it's also great to just see people just run with it stuff. We'll do everything we can to help you to get to the new world.
00:38:35.350 - 00:39:01.386, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that's what we're trying to do. We need to grow a community. We need to work together to scale this, hence why we're open sourcing it. And we're working with all of you to help us scale this. Really nice to meet you. Evan Pyro, you've already done hedge contracts. Everybody reach out to him.
00:39:01.386 - 00:40:05.600, Speaker B: I've also added the link to our trueflation Discord channel, so a lot of conversations and chats will happen in there. So please not only connect with Evan Piro 700, but also sign up to the trueflation Discord channel for more interaction. But yeah, anybody wanting to work on this, reach out to Evan. So he's already got experience in this, so would love to do that here. Isaiah Fielder, what do you think about using cross chain bridges? For sure, we'd love that. Right. Our concept, and we've been talking to chainlink about working with CCIP where on the event you can provide collateral on one chain and borrow against that, or purchase a synthetic on another chain if that would be something you want to work.
00:40:05.600 - 00:40:53.550, Speaker B: And I think CCIP already have that is already running on Testnet and is in combination with like a proof of reserve, you can then manage the collateral and the amount of tokens you have in the float and try to minimize thereby the arbitrage. Rotam, is there some data about CaS vehicles, cars, cars vehicles? Yes, we have automotive data and I think the subcategories here in transportation, the subcategories are coming soon. I think the subcategories are already available so we can actually do something in the automotive category.
00:40:54.530 - 00:41:09.090, Speaker A: We've got categories, and we've got some subcategories. So I think we can do something against transportation costs. And we also have oil prices, so we can do things against fuel costs.
00:41:09.750 - 00:41:30.650, Speaker B: But I know we have a lot of automotive data, so if you really want car data, automotive data, happy to share more with you. Rotam. Please reach out in the discord. We have car gurus data. We work with Kelly Blue Book. We work with a number of. Cox with a number.
00:41:30.650 - 00:41:58.754, Speaker B: Mannheim with a number of different providers that actually have a lot of automotive information. New cars and secondhand cars in the US. And I don't know who we work with in the UK as well. Yeah, CDPs. Collateralized default. P stand for again. Yeah, I mean, definitely.
00:41:58.754 - 00:42:32.298, Speaker B: Those are definitely derivative products that are already being created in DFI on the web. So on block three. Web three. So, yeah. What could they look like? I don't know, but be creative, think what they would look like, and I'm sure we can find a market for that. Evan Pyro. Basically very similar to a maker vault with an arbitrary collateral type.
00:42:32.298 - 00:43:02.102, Speaker B: Correct? Exactly. I mean, it's very similar to maker. And you can create whatever collateral you'd like in the maker vault. However, you can get that into that vault. That could be having a physical custodian acting as the representation. That could be plugging in with specific custodian, like a copper. And copper would have accounts with their customers.
00:43:02.102 - 00:43:10.780, Speaker B: They could then plug that in, and that could be a collateral. Or you can create a synthetic vault, fork the maker vault, and then build off the back of that.
00:43:12.190 - 00:43:55.420, Speaker A: The other thing that, and again, I'm throwing these ideas out, is that you could try playing with NFTs, because what happens in a lot of, for example, gold. Gold bullion is tied to specific gold bars. And so there are commodities markets where an NFT model would work, where you'd be trading. Art is an example, where people have been doing NFT models against art. So that's another possibility of connecting that pricing data. Yes.
00:43:56.590 - 00:44:38.840, Speaker B: Great. I think that's more or less everything from our side and the material that we have. Yeah. Is there anything we need to add? Our discord channels, our chats, the chains we have available. In essence, what we're trying to do is really build out sort of a faster solution, a democratized solution. That's census available. And thanks to Chainlink, we're available on multiple different chains already today.
00:44:38.840 - 00:45:15.490, Speaker B: We track now some 50 to 60 different data sources that we aggregate information from. We want to make this much faster available. We do it already. Faster than government institutions, because they only provide this sort of data on a monthly basis. And then you need to put that on chain. How do we make this more real time so that you can make better decisions all the time? Yeah, chain link functions. Go ahead, Joseph.
00:45:17.990 - 00:46:08.434, Speaker A: We've been trying to get it, let me put it that way. We've actually been talking to people about getting not just carbon credit data, but carbon usage data. So this is one of those things where, at least for the purpose of the hackathon, just use the chain link interface and put an insert carbon credit data there. So if you can write your smart contract and then specify exactly what data that you need, you can use that to call our interface to get just test data for now. But what you should focus on there is to just decide exactly what data you need, and then we'll see about getting it.
00:46:08.632 - 00:46:55.460, Speaker B: So we already have a couple of providers for climate data, so both declimate and hyphen, who are also part of the Chainlink ecosystem. We work with them on aggregating their data, but we've also got other sort of credible sources that we've just acquired and partnered with around making their data available through the trueflation marketplace. What we're trying to do there is get companies like Regen Network, like Nori, like all infra, that have a lot of reputation around carbon data, carbon marketplaces, carbon trading, toucan, aggregating their carbon information that's already available and then making that available to you.
00:46:57.670 - 00:47:40.450, Speaker A: So the powerful thing about the trufflation data interface is the reason why it's so powerful is that if you write your smart contracts to grab inflation data, then as new data becomes available, you don't have to recode it in order to get the new data. You just change one line. You have trueflation data. You change one line, you get oil stuff. Once you get it working on oil, you just change one line and you get any data that we can provide. So that's the beauty of our system, is you write once, and once you've written it, then anytime there's new data, you just change like two lines and you get the new data.
00:47:40.600 - 00:48:50.474, Speaker B: Yeah, it's here. What's an example of product that is used in the current finance that takes into account inflation rate and what some of the current products that have been made to help us form the idea for the future? Well, the biggest products that are out there that are using inflation data are tips. Treasury inflation protected securities, those are bonds issued by the government that protects you against inflation. So they offset inflation against the nominal value. So if you sign up for ten year bond, I want a tips related bond that makes sure that not only am I earning the interest on the ten years I am retaining, and they are protecting me against the nominal value depreciation against inflation. So I'm also inflation hedged. And so those are the biggest inflation protected products out there.
00:48:50.474 - 00:49:20.670, Speaker B: The only other products are really derivatives, right. Derivatives aren't inflation protection. You're betting against the change in price in the future. And the biggest industry around that is oil. And the biggest customers for that segment are airlines. Airlines hedge themselves against oil inflation a lot because their biggest cost basis is oil. But you need to be a big airline.
00:49:20.670 - 00:49:56.762, Speaker B: You need to have the right middleman that can connect you to the right trader that has access to these marketplaces where they can buy futures. They know I will need excluding COVID and events like that, or black swan events like that, you can then sort of forecast into the future. I need oil for the next three years. This is the amount of oil I'm going to need. This is my forecasted travel schedule. And as a result, across these distances that I fly, these are the amount of oil that I'm going to need. I want to hedge myself against price swings.
00:49:56.762 - 00:50:30.620, Speaker B: So I'm going to put 30% of that into futures at today's and lock the pricing in today so that I can buy it at that price tomorrow. And there are companies out there building, doing that same thing in Cryptoland. There's Landx, they're taking wheat, soy, rice prices and they're building synthetic tokens of that. For one year you lock it up and in one year's time you buy a kilo of rice that you purchase today, you will get that one kilo of rice delivered to you. And so things like that are happening.
00:50:31.070 - 00:51:23.770, Speaker A: So one of the reasons why what we're doing is unique is that if you go in the tradfi world, there really aren't inflation protected. I mean, there aren't really any inflation derivatives. And if you go to any bank and say, okay, we want an inflation derivative. The reason why there are no inflation derivatives is that before us there was no daily index of inflation. And without a daily index of inflation, if you're just getting new inflation data each month, then you can't create a futures index off of inflation. This is the one key thing that we've provided, is we now have a daily index, inflation. And at this point it's a matter of creating a synthetic asset around that index.
00:51:27.070 - 00:52:26.398, Speaker C: I actually want to add something to this question as well, talking about thinking of products to help you form the future. When I think about what's happening, and I just think about when Defi came on the scene, it was amazing, right? It was pretty amazing. What we could do going from just BTC and now we could do all these things. But just remember, that was all mostly with just cryptocurrencies, ethereum, dog coins, whatever, and these ideas of liquidity pools and everything is. CDPS is very cool. But if you imagine that and then take the whole finance market that's happening, that's been going on forever, and think about all these things, and if you're starting to move these into DeFi, so just kind of think about what you could do with taking the benefits of DeFi and blending them with what people are already used to with existing, like commodity data, for example. Right.
00:52:26.398 - 00:52:34.370, Speaker C: I feel like the next wave could be a lot bigger than the last one, is what I'm thinking. I'm not sure if that helps.
00:52:35.590 - 00:53:49.006, Speaker A: Well, the way I think about it is that the current financial system is like VCR tapes and deFi streaming. So I'm actually thinking that I think it's going to happen a lot faster than people think that over time, because the technology for DFI is just so much better, that ten years from now, the traditional finance people will be like VCR rental stores. There's still a few around, but everyone's gone to Netflix and streaming. And so that's the future of finance. Is Defi and systems around mean? I mean, one way of thinking about it is that anybody who's ever tried to wire money between point A and point B? I mean, okay, wire money from San Francisco to Hong Kong. I mean, it takes how long to do, I mean, I can send a message in like half a millisecond. And that tells you just how broken the current financial system is.
00:53:49.006 - 00:54:17.000, Speaker A: And everything is built on top of all this old technology. And it's reached the point where people are asking if I can send an email across the world, why does it take me three days to wire money? And why does it take me like a week to open an account? I mean, it's just silly. You multiply this by all those inefficiencies and you realize just how this is the future.
00:54:23.740 - 00:55:00.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, as we mentioned, right, I mean, how big is this defi market? I think we're just at the beginning of it. Not to mention the market cap of all the companies in the DFI, the actual opportunities associated with the trading volume and the revenues obtained by a lot of these DFI protocols. Yeah, it's in the 20 billion range today. That's likely to go to 200 billion in the next three, four years, if not more.
00:55:03.180 - 00:55:19.180, Speaker A: And then you look at the size of the tradfi market. Within my lifetime, tradfi will be. DFI will become tradfi. It's happening as we speak.
00:55:19.330 - 00:55:49.924, Speaker B: Exactly. I think that's the opportunity. And if you look at it, the whole crypto market industry based on market cap is today at $1 trillion or 1.3 maybe, depending on the day. And you look at gold alone, just gold market, and the gold industry is at $10 trillion. So we got a ten x opportunity in front of us. And that would just be bitcoin, because bitcoin is the digital gold.
00:55:49.924 - 00:56:18.684, Speaker B: Then that would be the gold market. So bitcoin alone has the potential to go to 10 trillion. Now, you then look into all the derivatives market, which in Sergey's presentation, they call it quadrillion. You look at the stock markets, the commodity markets, those are all in the magnitude of hundreds of trillions of dollars. Real estate alone is, I think, $300 trillion. And the derivatives market is in quadrillions. So you look at that, all of those get tokenized.
00:56:18.684 - 00:56:57.070, Speaker B: And financial, the financing of a lot of these products get democratized. That results in a significant improvement and growth opportunity for Defi. In that case. Yeah, look, happy hacking to everybody. Thank you for your time, really. Please join the Discord channel. We'll support it over there.
00:56:57.070 - 00:57:12.030, Speaker B: Hopefully. It's a self explanatory quick start guide in the blog post and look forward to interacting with you and engaging down this path. And, yeah, thanks for your time.
00:57:13.950 - 00:57:15.218, Speaker A: Bye it.
00:57:15.304 - 00:57:20.820, Speaker B: If there are no more questions. See you, everybody.
00:57:21.590 - 00:57:22.514, Speaker C: Later, guys.
00:57:22.632 - 00:57:24.270, Speaker B: All right, bye.
