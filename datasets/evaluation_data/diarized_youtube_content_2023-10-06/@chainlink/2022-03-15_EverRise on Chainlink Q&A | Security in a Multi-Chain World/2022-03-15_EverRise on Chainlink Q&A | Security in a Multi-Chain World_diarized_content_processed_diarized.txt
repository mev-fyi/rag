00:00:07.930 - 00:00:20.090, Speaker A: All right. Hi, everyone, and welcome back to Chainlink Q A. Really excited today to get started with Everrise. My name is Zaji. I'm a part of Chainlink Labs, and I'm joined today by Jen. How's it going, Jen?
00:00:20.250 - 00:00:22.366, Speaker B: It's going good. How are you?
00:00:22.548 - 00:00:32.866, Speaker A: I'm doing good. Doing well. Really excited to see both of us on here. Two ladies in the blockchain space building. Cool things. So I'm excited to learn more about what you're all doing at Everrise.
00:00:33.058 - 00:00:57.678, Speaker B: Yeah, me too. A little bit of context about me and everize. So, obviously, I'm Jen. I'm the director of marketing over at, you know, my role really focuses on our brand campaigns, our media buying, strategic marketing partnerships, and really just bringing as many eyes to our protocol as possible. So doing things like Amas with Chainlink. So really excited to be here, too. Thank you for having me on.
00:00:57.844 - 00:01:11.940, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Honestly, not so much of a hard job. It sounds like you're having a great time, so that's awesome. Cool. Why don't we jump right into it? Tell us a little bit about what everrise is doing and how you have all come to be where you are today.
00:01:12.550 - 00:01:53.374, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think to really understand what everrise is doing, we first need to zoom out and look at the DeFi landscape overall. Right? Like, I feel like we are all in this space because there's massive growth year after year in DFI, and every day millions of dollars are pouring into the space. And for me, looking at this in the context of Internet technology, I see this as a foundational shift with web three. Like, web three is here and it's here to stay. However, as growth continues to happen in DFI and global ownership of cryptocurrency increases, so do the scams. And that's the really big, unfortunate thing we're just starting to see.
00:01:53.374 - 00:02:49.090, Speaker B: Reports come in from 2021, and the reports are showing that billions of dollars are being stolen in cryptocurrency, and that number increases year after year. And the sad reality is a lot of that is coming from DFI protocols, and that's because there is no fundamental security infrastructure in DeFi right now. And the other thing is, due to the nature of defi, since there are no centralized authorities, security becomes a really difficult problem to solve. But it's super solvable, and that's kind of where everrise comes in. We're the first to deliver multi chain security and developer tools for DeFi protocols. Like, the way to think about everrise is we're essentially a multi chain ecosystem of dapps with a common thread running through all of our products, which is security. And our ecosystem is powered by the everrise token, which has the ticker rise.
00:02:49.090 - 00:03:16.540, Speaker B: Currently, our ecosystem is live on five blockchains. We have b and B chain, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche and Phantom. And we have 5d apps that are live, that are b to b and consumer facing that solve very specific problems that we're seeing in the space. In addition to that, I know I've been on a little bit of a spiel about everize, but we do have four more d apps slated for release by the end of quarter two of this year.
00:03:17.550 - 00:03:33.790, Speaker A: That's really exciting and I'm sure we'll jump into that later. But, yeah, thanks for explaining the landscape of where everrise sits. And I think it's really interesting to talk about how you're blockchain agnostic. Why did you choose to do that? And how does that affect everyone that's building within everrise?
00:03:34.150 - 00:04:14.346, Speaker B: Yeah, I think blockchain agnostic is a really interesting term, and it's actually one that I actually haven't thought about using in our messaging, but it's very true. Right. Our architecture, the way that our protocol is set up, it actually allows us to easily expand into additional blockchains. And for us, the ultimate goal is to make our suite of dapps the gold standard for security across all of Defi. So as we continue to mature as a protocol, we have every intention of expanding to more blockchains. And maybe one day we'll sit on all of the blockchains and truly be blockchain agnostic, as you put it.
00:04:14.528 - 00:04:30.580, Speaker A: Yeah. And no, it's true. It's like once you get started, one leads to the next, to the next. I know we've seen that in chain link as well. So that makes sense. And is there a reason why you started to expand to different ones? Was it based off of maybe, like transaction time or anything like that?
00:04:30.950 - 00:05:28.630, Speaker B: Not necessarily. I think it goes back to that idea of we really want our products to be that security standard. And in order for us to do that, we have to expand our ecosystem constantly into these new blockchains to make our suite of tools available to the developers that are on that chain. Right? Yeah, and I think that's the other thing is Defi is so big. It's not just your bitcoins, your ethereums, or your BnB chain. There's so many blockchains out there and they're all growing every single day. So we want to be there as they grow and yeah, the more we can insert security at the forefront and as this industry grows, I think that's kind of when we'll start to see mass adoption of defi, like when the face value of the risk that's associated with coming into this space is significantly lowered.
00:05:28.970 - 00:05:43.660, Speaker A: Yeah. And you talk a lot about security and making sure that everrise is at the forefront of that. Diving into the integration with Chainlink, do using our price feeds affect that at all? Does it help create a more secure environment for your community?
00:05:44.510 - 00:06:07.200, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think the big thing that I love about the chain link price feeds is it allows us to bring this new level of transparency to everything that we're doing. Right. We're a multi chain ecosystem and users should always have access to the most accurate, high quality and tamper proof price feeds and stacks. And with Chainlink we're actually able to deliver that.
00:06:08.050 - 00:06:23.110, Speaker A: That's really awesome. And I think know it's something that a lot of your community will be able to actionably see. I think that that's a cool thing about price feeds is actually on the UI and people can actually go see it and it's not just behind the scenes. So it really shows what you're building and where that's.
00:06:25.370 - 00:07:09.270, Speaker B: Know, like we have a couple of different dapps, like we have Everbridge, which is our bridging mechanism to go cross chain. And it's really important that if people are bridging rise from one chain to another, that they're able to see what is the exact price of rise currently on the BNB chain, for example, versus what is the price of rise on the phantom blockchain. And so being able to bring that visibility into our D apps as well, not only one, it makes the transactions more seamless. It continues to provide that transparency that we were talking about. And it's just like one of the many ways that we're actually integrating price feeds into our ecosystem.
00:07:10.730 - 00:07:28.780, Speaker A: Yeah, that's very clear. And it does make a lot of sense that the community would be interested in seeing that. So that's awesome. And I actually checked out the recent AMA. You all did, and been watching some of your content. It sounds like a v three. Is this coming? Is there anything you want to share on what you're all building on that front?
00:07:29.230 - 00:08:29.038, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm personally really excited about v three. I think with v three it's going to introduce a whole new staking protocol that really hasn't been seen before. Especially because we're now moving from our v two smart contract which is really just something that supports our multichain ecosystem to something that now supports a multichain ecosystem but also has an integrated on chain utility NFT component. So the Everize v three smart contract will have on chain utility nfts. These nfts actually contain vote escrowed everize that act as weighted governance tokens, and that's what's going to be taking over our existing staking protocol. We're referring to these nfts as everize NFT stakes. And these stakes will be bridgeable and transferable, and they'll have inherent value because they'll be tied to however much rise is staked within them.
00:08:29.038 - 00:08:39.300, Speaker B: We haven't really seen anything like this out in the market, so we're really excited to bring a new, highly secure and innovative type of staking protocol to the space.
00:08:40.230 - 00:09:05.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I personally hadn't seen too much on this front either, so I was learning a lot while listening to all of the content. So I'm glad you have a lot of information out there, and I would definitely encourage everyone to go to the Everrise YouTube channel to learn more. But you touched on a piece there that I found interesting, the governance aspect there. So does that mean that community members will actually have governance within Everrise and that they will have a say in anything and how it's built?
00:09:06.110 - 00:10:11.280, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So one of the D apps that we have released is everone, and Everone is our smart contracts locker. Basically, developers who have smart contracts can come in and secure their smart contract within Everone. And whenever they need to make a change to the smart contract or to any of the functions, they're able to initiate a vote within their community to unlock the smart contract and receive it back. So that's Everon at the bare minimum basics, right? With Everize V three, now that we're bringing in these everize NFT stakes, we wanted to make these really like our governance tokens. Another thing that's on our roadmap with ever own, specifically, is actually building that into a full blown turnkey Dow solution. So folks who are staking everize, once we go to our v three contract, they will have the weighted governance tokens required to vote within ever own for various changes that everize will be doing in the future.
00:10:12.530 - 00:10:17.746, Speaker A: So you're truly trying to decentralize as you grow, it sounds like, which is.
00:10:17.848 - 00:11:00.480, Speaker B: Not easy to do for sure, and we're trying to decentralize as much as we can. I think the reality is, although we are in the decentralized space, and I fully believe in decentralization, a little bit of centralization doesn't hurt. A lot of folks who aren't developers may not know exactly what is the best way of evolving a smart contract. And I think that's kind of where the Everise leadership team kind of is able to come in and guide the project in the right direction. But we for sure want to make sure that our community has a say in the changes that we make and in the changes that we do and that we're fully transparent with them every single step of the way.
00:11:01.250 - 00:11:28.086, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I definitely see that. And when I was listening to the amas, it sounds like you have a really strong community that appreciates that and is always looking at where is all the information coming from and how can we make sure we have secure communication from the team. So I think you're all doing a great job on that front. And just in general, how have you been growing your community? Has it been through educational pieces? Is it more so that they're excited about certain areas of the platform, what's going on there?
00:11:28.268 - 00:11:42.266, Speaker B: Yeah, so I just want to start off by saying we have the best community. I'm sure every D five protocol that you chat with will hop on and say that. But truly with ever eyes, we do have the best D five community.
00:11:42.448 - 00:11:53.006, Speaker A: And I actually have truly seen it on social media and the comments, everybody was so stoked with your video on V three. So it definitely seems like they're really excited about what you're all doing.
00:11:53.188 - 00:12:33.710, Speaker B: Yeah. And what I will say is there's obviously a bunch of different types of projects within the Defi space. And for us, we really look at ourselves as a utility project that is solving a solution. And security isn't the most sexiest thing. It's not the easiest thing to drive what folks consider hype around. But what it does tell me is we're here to build for the future and everize is here for the longevity of Defi. And what's really incredible about our community is they see that, they see the utility that we bring, they see the use case of all the applications that we've released so far.
00:12:33.710 - 00:13:15.530, Speaker B: And so with that said, instead of just going out and shilling a project, what's really incredible is they are constantly on social media, in our discord, in our telegrams, actually educating people about the issues and problems in the space. So that way folks that are coming in leave a more educated Defi investor. And I think that's really how our community has grown in such a strong, organic way. Right when you're having really thoughtful and constructive conversations around what exactly are we seeing in the space? What problems are there? How do we solve it? How do we as a community come together and support, like, a long term vision?
00:13:16.110 - 00:13:33.170, Speaker A: Right? No, and it's interesting that you say that. Right? They are kind of empowering each other, which I think creates a really strong community, for sure. Do you feel like the users that you have are pretty crypto native, or do you have a lot of newer people in the space? What does that landscape look like?
00:13:33.320 - 00:14:36.210, Speaker B: I think it's a mix of both. I think majority of our users are folks that are very defi native or crypto native, as you put it. But selfishly, my ultimate goal for Everize is that we are the first point of contact for anyone who's interested in coming into deFi. Some of the things that our team is working on is making a bunch of educational videos. Breaking down, just, like, the foundational information that you need to understand to be able to participate in this space without having to second guess yourself. Like, breaking down. What is a smart contract? What are D five bridges? How do they work? All of these really basic things that I feel like before, you could go look on Google, but you're cross referencing 30 different links, trying to be piecing together the information of, like, okay, how does this actually all connect together? So one of the things that we're doing is we're making an educational YouTube video series that's going to be called navigating Defi.
00:14:36.210 - 00:14:40.306, Speaker B: A couple of episodes should be dropping in the next few weeks, but, yeah.
00:14:40.328 - 00:14:41.446, Speaker A: Nice. I was going to say we need.
00:14:41.468 - 00:15:27.140, Speaker B: Those links as soon as, you know, I'll send them to you as soon as have. The idea is that moving forward, as we continue to build this educational foundation, that anyone coming into the DeFi space will be able to watch these videos and Everize will be that first point of contact, and we can kind of educate them on. Okay, here are red flags when it comes to security. As you're doing your due diligence, here are the best practices and things that you should look for if you're going to be investing in DeFi protocols. And hopefully, after they go through that funnel, they're able to participate in the space in a way that empowers them to feel like they're able to take full financial control of whatever it is they're doing in the DeFi space.
00:15:27.510 - 00:15:59.920, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's really powerful to have it come from a project that you're interested in, because like you mentioned when I was first getting into crypto, I have to watch a YouTube video and then I have to somehow go back to say, the Dap that I'm trying to use and figure out how that YouTube video applies to that. Like, there's so many nuances there that you might miss out on or technicalities. And so I think the information coming directly from the team and maybe even explaining how know fits into different aspects of the Defi landscape, I think as a user experience is just a lot more mean. I wish I had that when I was starting.
00:16:01.730 - 00:16:32.300, Speaker B: Yeah, me too. As I'm making these videos, the frame of mindset that we're in is like, if you knew nothing about DeFi, is this helpful? And it's kind of like looking and talking to the team about what was everything that you wish you knew before you got into this space and capturing those little nuances and making sure that that's in there in one place so people aren't having to look at 30 million different links to figure it out themselves.
00:16:32.830 - 00:16:55.806, Speaker A: It's just too much. Yeah, no, I think building that next gen of DFI users is an amazing endeavor to take on. So I look forward to seeing how that grows. But. Awesome. And then just a few last things. What about some of these dapps that you are building? Did you want to share any more about some of the ones that are already existent or that you are going to make anything that people should be aware of?
00:16:55.988 - 00:17:07.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll talk a little bit more about Everbridge and Everswap because I do want to talk about how your price feeds have impacted those dapps so far. Awesome.
00:17:07.452 - 00:17:08.840, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd love to hear it.
00:17:10.010 - 00:17:42.910, Speaker B: Everbridge is really interesting for us because it's completely different than traditional defi bridges we've seen in the space. Right. Traditional bridges leverage a mint and burn function within their bridge. And that's what a lot of the bridge exploits we've seen are. They're exploits that come in and take advantage of this mint function. They mint an infinite amount of tokens and completely drain the liquidity. And I'm sure you've seen the headlines like various bridges have been exploited for a couple of hundred million dollars, which is not any small amount.
00:17:42.910 - 00:18:34.206, Speaker B: Yeah, a tiny, tiny amount, but it's like an absurd amount of money. And it's a single point of failure for that bridge. So instead of utilizing a mint and burn function, we've actually created a vault system that basically leverages a lock and unlock mechanism. And that lock and unlock mechanism is what allows our bridge to achieve blocked speed, cross chain transfers, and the way that Chainlink's price feed integrates into that is it actually allows us to show the most accurate gas prices for going cross chain. When we had initially released the bridge, we were kind of having to do some estimates. And so now it's really nice that we're actually able to provide users like, no, this is the gas fee that it's going to cost you, and this is the most accurate pricing you're going to get.
00:18:34.388 - 00:18:43.106, Speaker A: It's nice as a user not to have to guess either, because then you're kind of basing it off of an idea, but that's not necessarily going to be the final price.
00:18:43.288 - 00:18:57.720, Speaker B: Exactly. And then, God forbid, if you were to be like, oh, okay, I guess this gas fee looks good, and you go through with the transaction, and then you go and you check your crypto, and you're like, wait, why do I have significantly less ethereum than I thought I would?
00:18:58.250 - 00:19:08.394, Speaker A: And it's just not like a good user experience. And like you mentioned, newer people in the space, it turns people off if they're not getting accurate information. So I think, yeah, it's really interesting.
00:19:08.592 - 00:20:04.814, Speaker B: Totally. And another one of our dapps that actually leverages your price feeds in the same way is actually Everswap. So Everswap is this multi chain Dex that we've built. And within Everswap, we actually have a pretty special feature called our native coin swap. So what our native coin swap allows users to do is send native cryptocurrencies, cross chain, to all the blockchains that everizes on. And the reason why this is really important is because traditionally, in order to swap native cryptocurrencies and bridge them and go cross chain, you're like having to use a centralized exchange. And there's nothing wrong with centralized exchanges, except all of a sudden, the steps that you have to take to perform a simple cross chain swap is now, instead of, like, maybe three steps, it's now a seven step process with gas and transaction fees along the way.
00:20:04.814 - 00:20:47.926, Speaker B: So the native coin swap eliminates all of that. Like, let's say I had BnB, which is a BEP 20 coin, and I wanted to bridge that over to Ethereum for ETh ERC 20, I would actually be able to utilize the native coin swap within Everswap to do so. And it would happen. Average transaction, again, is as fast as it takes to mint a block on the blockchain. So we've seen that happen as fast as 40 seconds upwards to, like, two minutes to be able to go from b and B 20 to Ethereum ERC 20. And to calculate those gas fees, again, we're using the chain link price feeds.
00:20:48.118 - 00:21:04.260, Speaker A: Yeah. No, that's amazing. Like you said, it just eliminates a lot of intermediary steps and it really makes the experience a lot easier and faster for everyone involved. And also, then you don't have to keep leaving and going to different places. It's just all happening within everrise, which is the best and safest experience.
00:21:04.710 - 00:21:05.460, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:21:06.070 - 00:21:07.154, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:21:07.352 - 00:21:27.800, Speaker B: Yeah, I did want to call out some other highlights. You know what, I'll actually share my screen for this. So one of the things that we are utilizing your price feeds for are our stats page, which all of our community members have access to. So let's pull that up.
00:21:28.350 - 00:21:30.570, Speaker A: Very cool. It's like the anticipation.
00:21:32.030 - 00:21:32.780, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:34.430 - 00:21:37.100, Speaker A: Yes. Let me get it in here. Okay. We can see it.
00:21:37.710 - 00:22:08.086, Speaker B: Yeah. So here you can see at the top the possible arbitrage opportunities, because we do exist across five different blockchains. But all of this data is updating in real time. And it's able to do that because of the chain link price feeds. We're able to see what is the price of Ethereum in relation to rise. You can see here that, oh, Ethereum is currently down like 0.4%, but rise is up 0.1%.
00:22:08.086 - 00:22:18.358, Speaker B: And this is all thanks to chain link price feeds and our amazing team that was able to assemble all this information in a way that makes sense.
00:22:18.524 - 00:22:36.814, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a lot of data. A lot of information. So that's a really incredible tool for a community member to use. And I think if I was a part of Everrise community, I'd think that that's amazing. I'd have that bookedmarked all the time just to go look and check it out. Where can everybody find that? What's the link?
00:22:37.012 - 00:22:44.078, Speaker B: It's data. Everize, comstats, HTML. Perfect.
00:22:44.164 - 00:22:45.286, Speaker A: We'll have it in the description.
00:22:45.338 - 00:22:56.066, Speaker B: We'll get it in the description. I have one more thing that if that was intimidating, this one might be a little less intimidating. So let me see if I can pull this one up.
00:22:56.168 - 00:22:56.578, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:56.664 - 00:23:00.130, Speaker B: This pretty cool. So we actually have this thing.
00:23:00.280 - 00:23:01.990, Speaker A: I have it up. Go ahead.
00:23:02.140 - 00:23:27.870, Speaker B: Perfect. We have this thing called Everchart, which is our 24 hours, seven days a week, like live stream that's on YouTube that basically displays all of the charts as well as some of the same data that you saw off of that stat. So you can see it all live here because we are doing a live stream. I don't have the music playing, but there's like some vibe music that goes along with the live stream.
00:23:28.690 - 00:23:32.958, Speaker A: It's a good thing to keep in the background, whatever you're doing throughout the day.
00:23:33.124 - 00:23:44.820, Speaker B: Yeah. So I have a projector for my tv at home and there will be work days where I'll just throw it on the projector, turn the soundbar on and just have the charts up the entire time while I'm working.
00:23:45.270 - 00:24:08.726, Speaker A: No, it's awesome. I think all the visuals, all the tangible information Everrise is creating really helps bring all of this DFI terminology and things that I think are not always super digestible. Just brings it to life. So it's really cool to see, and I can definitely see why your community is so excited about v three and everything you're building. I think you're all doing an amazing job. Thank you so much for coming today. It's been really interesting to learn more about Everize.
00:24:08.918 - 00:24:15.790, Speaker B: Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure talking about Everize. It's all I do all day, every day.
00:24:15.940 - 00:24:37.606, Speaker A: Right. It's like once you're in blockchain, it just becomes your know, everything is what you revolve around, but that's why we love it. And it's awesome to meet somebody else who's also just as excited as I am to talk about what you do every day. So, yeah, thank you again, Jen. We really appreciate it. And if you want to follow along, there'll be more links in the description to check out Everrise. Any other links that people should be aware of? Maybe your website, your Twitter account?
00:24:37.788 - 00:25:08.320, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm not that interesting, but you can find me at Jennifer on Twitter. But the more important handles you should be looking for to find Everize would be at Everize on Twitter. And if you're looking for a community or you want to join in on the conversation and talk about the future of security in the space, check out everize.com slash community. And you can find all of our social links from telegram and discord to Facebook and Instagram. So I hope to see more of you guys there.
00:25:08.770 - 00:25:19.230, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Thank you, everyone for tuning in. We'll definitely have some more interesting conversations like this to come on the Chainlink YouTube channel. And until then, we'll talk soon. Thank you. Bye.
