00:00:00.330 - 00:00:16.570, Speaker A: You. Hello everyone. Welcome, welcome. Day three of our ten days bootcamp. Amazing. I'm so proud of you. I saw a lot of smart contests deployed yesterday.
00:00:16.570 - 00:00:48.838, Speaker A: You did your first smart contest. Congrats to you. And today it's an amazing day because we are talking about chain link, we are talking about oracles and we are creating a token, an ERC 20 token and doing selfie stuff with this token using chain link. So welcome. And this is really amazing. Yes. And don't forget to share with your friends on Twitter.
00:00:48.838 - 00:01:28.510, Speaker A: I'm part of the chain link boot camp 2024. You are starting the year so well. Let's go. I think I can share my screen directly. And let's start with the pet. So here is the pet for you and I'm presenting now like always. Put your name and city, country.
00:01:28.510 - 00:02:05.240, Speaker A: Let's try to not do a mess, to not delete everything. We are being better. And from the three sessions, the session that until now is more organized in the pad is the spanish session. Congrats, guys. And now I think day by day you are understanding how the pads works as well and you'll be better and amazing. Jiomu is from Portugal. Can repeat the session later.
00:02:05.240 - 00:02:42.260, Speaker A: I know that's a bit later for you, but you can do it. So here we are. Now the people are joining this moment. I will add some information for you here. Like the other sessions and session two if you lost it, add your name down please. Yes, thank you. Here, naming city countries.
00:02:42.260 - 00:03:29.650, Speaker A: Okay, let's get the links for you. So session one in English was this link. Session two in English was this. So it is. Let's add myself. So remember that I'm from Sao Paulo, Brazil and I'm amazing to have people from out the world. And Hassan, I saw your comment related to have some boot camp in Turkey.
00:03:29.650 - 00:03:55.580, Speaker A: I don't know if you was there. I don't remember, sorry. But I did a boot camp not in Turkey. I have again translating to me. But I was in Ankara on first weekend of December. We did an amazing boot camp over there. So we have a great community in Turkey as well.
00:03:55.580 - 00:04:59.720, Speaker A: Yes, let's wait a minute more for the people. Join and remember to join our chain link session. Chain link channel. Because on this way you will discover exactly everything that's happening, including this. Now we are live. Now here we are. Perfect.
00:04:59.720 - 00:05:46.512, Speaker A: I think we are good now. The name already disappeared here. Let's try to edit again Nami City below. It's good and interesting question here. Yes, I'm doing exactly the same content in the three language. So you can start in English and if you can understand Portuguese or Spanish you can finish in the order. If you have some problem with the timing.
00:05:46.512 - 00:06:23.498, Speaker A: Also we are sharing with you the link, the YouTube link later. So if you cannot do everything live, you can do later. And I did something wrong here because I have both the same. Let's see what I did wrong. And day one is this day two, is that okay? Here is the session two. Okay, we are ready. More than 100 people.
00:06:23.498 - 00:06:58.260, Speaker A: So good to start. Thank you. Let's go and I will talk about this in the beginning and at the end. So here is the presentation. Let's copy to you as well. I'm updating this day by day. It's here so you can read this care code some seconds to you to read this.
00:06:58.260 - 00:07:55.340, Speaker A: And like I said before, I'm updating this day by day. If you go over there now, there are all the content from today. Let's come back here. And also remember that in order to receive your certificate you must do all the tasks. And I'm adding the tasks day by day here as well. So let's copy the tasks for you. The task form and how this is working related to the task form here.
00:07:55.340 - 00:09:11.406, Speaker A: It's a form, it's a Google form and you are filling your email at the beginning. Use the same email days. If you come back to the form and fill the same email, you saw all the answers that you did and then you can update the new answers because I'm adding new questions, you being this way. Okay. And yes, I forgot to update this great question here. I'm talking about a wallet address that you like to receive your certificate because okay, we have our testnet wallet to learn but maybe you already have some poops, some nfts in another main net wallet and you'd like to receive your certificate on this wallet that you have your collection. So you can do this, you can do all the curse in a testnet wallet and receive the certificating another wallet address that you'd like to receive.
00:09:11.406 - 00:10:34.214, Speaker A: Okay great. So let's come back. We are not on session one so let's go down a lot. We are here on session three and here you are in the pad so I don't need to pass it again. Let's talk about smart content limitations and okay, yesterday you understand more related to the smart content, but the idea today is discover what we need to create better smart context and to connect the ismat contents with all the word. Here we are. Yes, I can tell you that there are limitations in ismatch context and the huge limitation is to connect these match contexts with information data that are, or in another blockchain or outside the blockchain world.
00:10:34.214 - 00:11:20.580, Speaker A: We used to say off chain. So how can we connect smart context with off chain data? This is the biggest limitation in a smart context. Here we are. Another point. Think about, okay, maybe I can create an API and access some web, choose website and get the information that I need. Yes, you can do this. But imagine that when you access an external site, this site can change the information.
00:11:20.580 - 00:13:02.206, Speaker A: So the validators are access to validate your transaction and they can get different results because the external website can change, can be updated. So in this way, if you try to access directly an external website, maybe you cannot have a consensus because the external environment, the external source is not deterministic. And when we talk about smart contracts, we are talking about a deterministic word, blockchain is this every time that you try to do a transaction, you do in the same way and receive the same result. So if you create as much content and call a function with some parameter, this must result the same in that time, that moment of that transaction was saved, was validated and included in the block, on the block. So with this chukao directly, an external API is not a guarantee that you can have the consensus that we need to have it in a blockchain. And imagine this is a big challenger to connect blockchains with market data or events data, or payments or banks. And I will talk more about chilling solvids.
00:13:02.206 - 00:14:25.690, Speaker A: To us, this is the point. In fact, the point to solve this are the blockchain oracles. And what's Oracle? Oracle is any device that interacts with the off chain world and provide external data or computation for the smart context. And imagine that when we talk about any data search, you can talk about temperature, or the information of my watch, how many steps I'm doing day by day, or the information related to sports or weather, or a lot of financial data, everything. We can use your real estate and we are talking a lot about the real world assets. And this is the point, how can we bring the real world assets to blockchains? But if you think about Oracle, assess that you create to do this connection with your off chain data. If you have a centralized oracle, this is too risk because this will be a huge point of failure.
00:14:25.690 - 00:15:29.890, Speaker A: Imagine that the oracle can get one information and manipulate this and send the other information to theismatch content. And this will be hackered forever in the smart content in order to change, you must do another transaction. So this is a huge problem and a huge concern that you must think about when you are thinking about Oracle. Centralized oracles are not a good solution and what you need, it's a decentralized oracle network. We used to say that this is a dawn and here we are. This is an example with Chainlink where we have a lot of real world data and the Chainlink network, this is a set of doms are doing the communication with any blockchain. Remember that chaining is not a blockchain.
00:15:29.890 - 00:16:56.426, Speaker A: Chaining communicates, chaining, it's a platform with services deployed in many blockchains. And in the same way that we can get information from the off chain world and bring it to as much content, you can do the opposite, like you have some information inside as much content and you'd like to share this, to use this in a real world event. So decentralized oracles are made by nodes that are runed by independent operators. The focus is the data validation to be sure that that information is right and to get a consensus, because more than one node are trying to get that information and they must get a consensus on that information. And think about chaining. The node operators have security views and it's possible to provide a history of validating the information in a correct way. And when we talk about decentralized Oracle network, this is the key points, the considerations that you must think about it to have a good oracle.
00:16:56.426 - 00:17:58.222, Speaker A: The data quality of the information, how you can have the proof, origins, the origin proofs, how the data is delivered and how is the validation. Do you have some crypto economic guarantees to be sure that this is validated in a way that you not be manipulated? And how is the privacy of the information. So these are points that we must think about when we talk about oracles. And this is Chainlink. Chainlink is the platform to connect the smart context with off chain data or with other blockchains. After CCIP, we have the cross chain communications as well. And important that remember, Chainlink is not a blockchain and chainlink is blockchain agnostic.
00:17:58.222 - 00:18:54.630, Speaker A: We have the chainlink nodes in different blockchains. And I really can say that Chainlink is the blockchain oracle with standards, because we are creating the base standard and we are used by some huge companies as well. Exactly because we have a good standard to use. So after this, the next sections, starting today until our last day, Friday, two Fridays. I'm talking about each chain link service today. I'm talking about the chainlink data feeds. And when we talk about data feeds, we are talking about DeFi, we are talking about tokens.
00:18:54.630 - 00:19:44.070, Speaker A: So first you present a bit of the chain link data feed and then we are creating, we are going to the hands on part creating first of all a token ERC 20 token. Create your token now in the way that they like to do it. Then we are creating a token shop. This will be a second smart contest that will interact with the first smart context. So new concept here, how to interact between smart context. The token shop will also interact with Chainlink because we are using a chainlink data fit. And the goal is to set up a price of our token in dollars, in USD.
00:19:44.070 - 00:20:46.880, Speaker A: But we are sending it to our concept in order to receive the token in the way that in the proportion that we define the price of that token, it will be like a fixed price. This is our hands on part that we are doing soon. First let's understand the data fits because we are using this today. So talking about data fits, we are talking about get data and assets prices inside your smart contract. And this is from external sources. And when we think about quotes, we are talking about a full market coverage using decentralized and centralized exchanges. And we also have some on these services.
00:20:46.880 - 00:21:29.744, Speaker A: We have premium data providers, aggregators, exchange and the consensus related to this is related to the volume based average method. And this is available on many blockchains. There are something here, we have more. Now I must update this image and let's understand this a bit more. For example, here we have a lot of chain link nodes. They are getting some price and you can see that the price is different for each node and we have the average of this. So we have the consensus of this.
00:21:29.744 - 00:23:04.188, Speaker A: And this is the final price here. When Chainlink is saving this information for you inside the smatch content in that timestamp and then you are consuming this inside your, okay, and think about some couriers, I don't know how it is in other countries, but for example in Brazil when we talk about stock exchange, we have only one in Brazil. And even if you have a lot of exchange or they are reporting the same price, okay, but when we talk about blockchain, we are talking about different exchange and each exchange has your own order book and can have a different price because of this, we can have a lot of arbitrage between them, including arbitrage between decentralized exchange and centralized exchanges. Okay, and with this we can say that this is some big companies that use chaining. And chaining is so important in the defi world. But this is some of them that you can take by example. Let's go here.
00:23:04.188 - 00:23:45.000, Speaker A: Let's start the hands on part. I'm hoping this for me and for you. Here we are. Where is my pet here. So let's take off the translations and if you need to put your name put obsess and here I'm starting to share the content with you. So here we are. This is the data feed.
00:23:45.000 - 00:25:03.990, Speaker A: What I have here we can see some popular fits. We can see some new feeds as well like MMA coin bones for example. This is the popular and it's interesting like let's open the BTC USD and here you can see that this exists. Should this be valid, we must have at a minimum of 21 sources reporting this information. Now we have 31 and here you can see all the 31 and the information of each of them including down. This is of interesting for you also we have this in other networks. For example let's see on arbitrary or avalanche is this you can see this but the people can ask me but why this is not update so minute by minute why this was updated 18 minutes ago.
00:25:03.990 - 00:26:26.944, Speaker A: If you need some oracle that's updated in the moment that you need, we have another service that is the data streams. You presented this later for you, but for now we are focused on the data feeds. Another let's go to the new feeds or search some feeds and you can see the feeds that have categories like the stable coins, the cryptocurrencies with USD, with eat. We have a proof of reserve that it's another point to get reserves from banks or from other chains and use it in your smart contracts. And the one that I used to search is the BRL. You can see that we have the code of the brazilian real in USD in our of these chains and this was special for me. Like I remember that I was in a class, in a live class in Bogota during the devcom week in 2022 when they launched this and it was life for me.
00:26:26.944 - 00:27:04.664, Speaker A: So it was so amazing to see this on my class. It is especially for me. Can this now you have some idea of this and let's come back to the final of the presentation. So you already have my presentation. I have some references for you and in a few minutes we are using the link token as well. Let's go to the hands on part. I'm missing some questions in the chat.
00:27:04.664 - 00:28:00.030, Speaker A: I'm not answering now because I'm focusing on the data fits today and some questions is a bit more generic. I think the best day to answer these kind of questions will be Friday with our team. If I answer all questions now, you can't finish in 2 hours. Let's go. So I think I can close this now I can close this. And we are creating our token now let's talk about token. When we talk about token, we have some partners, some standards of tokens and the ERC 20 token, it's a standard so old.
00:28:00.030 - 00:28:49.310, Speaker A: But when we talk about standards, we are talking about this is not an obligation. This is something that you decide to use in your token in your project in order to have a better communication with the market. Because if you say that your token is an ERC 20 token, it means that your token must have some functions. You can have the name of the function and don't implement the code of that, but you must have that name. This is the point. So let's share two points for you. First, ERC 20 standard.
00:28:49.310 - 00:29:50.418, Speaker A: Here, wait, I recommend you that you check this from Ethereum foundation directly. And here you can understand more related to the token standard itself and the methods you have it. So I must go here. Yes, I was looking for the at. So this is the token standard that we are talking about created in 2015. And our token must have a function called Nami with the name of the token, the symbol, the total supply, the balance. This is the definition of the function.
00:29:50.418 - 00:30:41.502, Speaker A: Like what are the returns and what is the name of the function? And you can study this better later. Are you only doing some overview of you when we talk about tokens and standards? Like I comment with you related to chainlink be the blockchain standard, the oracle standard for blockchains. We can talk about the wizard from open zeppelin. Here we are. Let's share this with you. And no, I'm not using the AI assistant. This is a good way to utilize using the open zeppelin content, the open Zeppelin library.
00:30:41.502 - 00:31:09.946, Speaker A: Open zeppelin. It's amazing company that audits smart context and they also created this library that it's so huge, use it so wide world. Okay. And you can understand a bit how this working and this is different from mine. I must update mine to use this permit. I'm using an old diversion. I just discovered this.
00:31:09.946 - 00:31:49.062, Speaker A: Okay. Imagine that you can change the name of your token, token song and the symbol and my token will be mintable. I'd like to mint tokens after I created the content. I'd like to have some permissions. So if I have some roles, it means that I have the minter role. So I can add accounts over there, addresses to mint my token and this is the basic. My token is almost like this.
00:31:49.062 - 00:32:17.774, Speaker A: But I change a bit. You can play around this later. For you, let's go to our talking. So we are going now to remix like always, all the classes you work on remix. Here we are. And remember that we must do the basic configuration first. Let me try to get in mind to help you.
00:32:17.774 - 00:32:40.678, Speaker A: Wait a minute. Okay. The most important part is to connect with your wallet. So on remix, do this first. Connect with your wallet. Let's see if I'm connected. Not sure.
00:32:40.678 - 00:33:08.210, Speaker A: And I will not be connected. This is the point. I'd like to start from zero with you. So I'm not connected. I must go to the icon five and change the environment to injected provider. And I changed my wallet. So I know that I must first unlock and then.
00:33:08.210 - 00:34:07.902, Speaker A: Okay, I'm connected and I am on Sepolia, you can see here because I am on Sepolia here. So good, this is done. Let's go to the second icon file Explorer. And now we are creating a file token. Sol, I shared the file with you, now I'm not using exactly the Open Zeppelin wizard. I started with them, but I just saw that they are using the permit and I'm not using this now. And also I changed something that I cannot change here because the default of decimal places on Ethereum and on a token is 18 decimal places.
00:34:07.902 - 00:34:43.924, Speaker A: But I decided to create my token like currency, a fiat currency with only two decimal places. Yes, perfect. I didn't know that I have this comment still yet. I forgot, sorry. So let's go here and get my content. I have my contact in another place. I just check it.
00:34:43.924 - 00:35:18.384, Speaker A: Here we are. Let's see if we don't have problems now let's go to the second icon and below the workspace, create a new file token, solve and paste for me. I'd like to see if this is good first. Okay, it's good. Now I can send it to you. Remember, don't cut the code. Don't do control x only, control c only copy the code.
00:35:18.384 - 00:36:09.236, Speaker A: Is that you can do it. Then we are deploying and let's add our name and token address here. Let's do it. Oh, by the way, maybe some of you don't have sepolia it yet. Do you have problems with this? And I'm missing some advanced questions here related to how nodes works. I'm not answering this now. Okay, I'm sharing with you a new faucet.
00:36:09.236 - 00:36:38.304, Speaker A: A new chaining faucet only to the workshop. Please don't share this outside because we prepare this faucet to you. So look, this is a new faucet. And I have some balance link in it as well. You can get ten links, 0.58. This is too much. Okay.
00:36:38.304 - 00:37:11.040, Speaker A: And I miss sharing this with you. In the pad. Only in the pad here are you putting in the beginning because maybe you can use this later. This is the workshop faucet. Someone cut the code. No, it's good. Okay.
00:37:11.040 - 00:37:57.286, Speaker A: And by the way, if you'd like to change the name, if you did it, create another. No problem. Yes, you must have your password. I know this. So don't share this password with the world, please. It's only to us during these ten days. Let's see if you can survive.
00:37:57.286 - 00:38:33.640, Speaker A: Okay, let's get the password. I did it in someplace. Wait, found it. Yeah, you get it. Here's. Wait a minute. I'm getting the information for you.
00:38:33.640 - 00:39:34.300, Speaker A: So this is the password now, probably after all the workshops you are changing this thing. The password is on my screen name. Let's share this with you. And this is the password. And get to what you need. For now you need Sepolia and you can get this. Let's see how we are.
00:39:34.300 - 00:40:10.130, Speaker A: Okay, so good. I will deploy my token now. And you can see that this is the token that I created. Being the chain link boot camp 2024 token. I will talk a bit more of the token a bit later. M. If the password didn't work, I must get a new one.
00:40:10.130 - 00:40:34.448, Speaker A: I think someone did wrong. Yes, someone is telling that it's working. Other no. So the people that's not working. Review the password. Review what you are doing. I can believe that you are Renee.
00:40:34.448 - 00:40:49.508, Speaker A: The faucet. Yes. Guys, I have six it here ten minutes ago. What you did here. Yeah, this is really amazing. I put a bit more of it for you. Wait a minute.
00:40:49.508 - 00:41:06.850, Speaker A: I have more it. I'm not putting out in the same time. But I. You get more before that. Remember that I was trying to deploy my token here. Let's do my token first. This is my token and I'm adding more it for you guys.
00:41:06.850 - 00:41:46.070, Speaker A: But get only what you need. Okay, wait, that I need to go to the right place. Here, here. Imagine that in my other screen. How many tabs I have open in the same time. So I'm sending to the faucet now a bit more. Let's see how you beat the balance in a few minutes.
00:41:46.070 - 00:42:24.590, Speaker A: Yeah, Craig, you are right. Are you asking them to send less? And like I said before, only get this if you need it. If you don't have enough. Okay, and I put a bit more, but it's still nothing. Let's add more. I do this one more time, but I will go forward. If you need more, I can add later.
00:42:24.590 - 00:42:57.260, Speaker A: Because this is only one more alternative. You have others and I must get a link with the team. I don't have the link. The link getting the official file set. In fact, for today you don't need the link yet. Only tomorrow. Let's see how we are.
00:42:57.260 - 00:43:15.480, Speaker A: Okay, I put ten. It's here. Now you can choose less. Guys, you don't need out of this. Okay, let's go forward. So we have a token. Let's understand.
00:43:15.480 - 00:43:45.812, Speaker A: What is this token? Wait, it. Oh, thank you, thank you. The four lights. Because if you choose less to get less eater, you don't need everything. Now it's better that more people can get it. Thank you so much. And here we are.
00:43:45.812 - 00:44:08.670, Speaker A: This is the token. You can see that this is almost like the open Zeppelin wizard. I'm using the open zeppelin libraries here. Okay. And my token is importing the libraries from open Zeppelin. This is the point. So everything that there are in these two contents, you be inside my content.
00:44:08.670 - 00:44:45.956, Speaker A: Then I'm defining a hash, a constant that you be the name minter row. And here you have a KC 256 hash. And remember yesterday that we learned what is a constructor. The constructor is colored. You'll be run it only when we are deploying the content. And in my constructor I'm defining the name of the token and the symbol. And here you can change it to your token.
00:44:45.956 - 00:45:03.064, Speaker A: The name of your token. You don't need to do the same token name. Okay. And then we are grating role. Remember the access yesterday. My access, my allow list here. It's a different way to manage permissions.
00:45:03.064 - 00:45:36.868, Speaker A: This is the grant role from the access control on open zapping. And this is the full role. It means that who is deploying the contact? You be the master admin of this. But also I'm granting the minted role to the token owners. Is this. And then I have the function mint. It means that inside the open Zeppelin library I have the underscore mint.
00:45:36.868 - 00:46:09.330, Speaker A: And I'm creating a public mint function. And the standard is the same like I have the address and I have the amount that I'd like to mint. This is public. It means that anyone can call this function. But in fact you will only be successful if you are in the minted role. Remember yesterday that we have some modifiers. This is a modifier as well.
00:46:09.330 - 00:46:46.190, Speaker A: And I change the amount of decimal places on my token, so the default is 18. When I do an override here, I'm changing to have only two decimal places. Okay, this is the token. What can I do now? I'd like to see my token on metamask. Let's do it. So remember, here you have your token address. I have mine here as well.
00:46:46.190 - 00:47:25.370, Speaker A: To add this on metamask, you go on metamask tokens and import something like this. Let's see. Metamask tokens import tokens. Then you paste the address of my token and you can see the symbol, the decimal places. It's so gray, but it's here. And next I'm importing. You can see that I don't have any token yet.
00:47:25.370 - 00:47:50.604, Speaker A: And if I go now on metamask on tokens, you can see my token is listed here. We have Sepolia. We have the order. And yes, today I'm prepared. I came with a lot of sepole. I can send more for you. Let's see the faucet.
00:47:50.604 - 00:48:23.144, Speaker A: Probably don't have enough anymore. Okay, you send more. I'm sending the other screen. Okay, I send a bit more. And this is. I have my token here. Let's come back to remix now and interact with our token.
00:48:23.144 - 00:48:48.980, Speaker A: Scroll down. I came into deploying different transactions. You scroll down, expand your token, and here you can see the same. The decimal places. The name of the token, the symbol, token supply, zero. Let's mint some token for you. So now on the remix mint.
00:48:48.980 - 00:49:48.020, Speaker A: How can I do this? I expand the mint function two, you be the wallet that is receiving the token. I'd like to mint tokens for myself. So I will copy my wallet address and pay attention in the amount. The amount. I'd like to have 100 tokens. So the amount is 100 plus because my token has two decimal places. Okay, if I have a token with 18 decimal places, it will be 118 zeros.
00:49:48.020 - 00:50:22.610, Speaker A: Now it's only $2. Okay, the people are talking about my sepolia. My amount of Sepolia. How I got this. I was in devconnect in November in Istanbul. And every person that was in Devconnect won a lot of sepolia and a lot of the new testnet. So if you was there and didn't get it, you can get it.
00:50:22.610 - 00:51:03.900, Speaker A: Let's mint now confirm it. Okay, so it's confirmed. I like to see my balance now. So I get my wallet came into balance off and check it. Here we are. I have this. If you go to total supply now, it's the same because it's only one.
00:51:03.900 - 00:51:47.706, Speaker A: Go to balance off later. And if I go to Metamask, I can see my token here as well. 100 tokens. Yes, it's working. There is a question here that it's interesting to respond because this is related to blockchain concepts. If you are a validator of the sepolia network, you will be rewarded with the sepolia token like the mainnet. If you are a validator of the mainnet, you own real it.
00:51:47.706 - 00:52:14.500, Speaker A: Something like that. So we can't mint sepolia? Sepolia is minted and rewarded to the validators of the network. This is a cryptocurrency. This is not exactly the behavior of your token. We can mint our tokens, but not the main token. The nativity token of your blockchain. Okay.
00:52:14.500 - 00:52:49.464, Speaker A: And great. I saw my balance here on remix. Also I saw my balance here on Metamask. And congrats for you. I'm so happy you create your first token now. This is really amazing. Now remember that I told you that we are using chain link data fit in another contract that you interact with this contract.
00:52:49.464 - 00:53:40.764, Speaker A: This is our goal. How can we do this? Let's create another contest now. Let's create the tokenshop soliciting this new token. Now where I am here IU collapse this. Go to the second icon file explorer. Create a new file. Not here.
00:53:40.764 - 00:54:09.770, Speaker A: I am in the wrong place here. Tokenshop. So here we are. Let's get the code of this for you. And I am in a wrong version. I would like to use this. Are you copy and paste for me first to be sure that this is working.
00:54:09.770 - 00:54:40.050, Speaker A: It seems that it's working. Let's see if everything is okay. I am in the right network. Great. Everything is okay. Let's share this with you and don't deploy yet. Okay, let's wait a minute because I must talk with you a bit more.
00:54:40.050 - 00:55:10.810, Speaker A: Let's understand what I have here. I'm importing the chain link service over there. Okay, I'll come back. Because this question is based and is important. What address do I putting the balance off? It's the address that you'd like to know the balance. So if you mint the token like I did here, I mint to this address. My address.
00:55:10.810 - 00:55:39.670, Speaker A: So here I delight to see the balance of my address. You can see the address of other account. But probably you don't have tokens over there. Okay, great question. I love these questions that there are beginner questions, but this is the kind of question that we must answer on this beginner's workshop. And sometime I forgot to talk more about it. Okay, great question.
00:55:39.670 - 00:56:36.330, Speaker A: And let's come back to the token shop. Here you can see that I'm importing the chain link services, the chain link data feed in the same way that I did with the open zeppelin in my token. And here I'm importing an interface. What's an interface? An interface, it's a definition of a concept without the search code. So I have all the names of the functions of that concept without the parameters that each function must have. But I don't have the search code. And remember that when we saw this, the data chain link supposed to have this here.
00:56:36.330 - 00:57:11.350, Speaker A: Each of this is a smart content. And when we are using the aggregator interface we can cow any of this with this interface. It's better to show this in another place. Wait, we have another point here. Important here. These two are important for you. IU added this in the pad here.
00:57:11.350 - 00:57:49.040, Speaker A: Someone cut and at least come back but you cut the code. Okay, let's see this. So this is the price fits that we are talking about. We have different kinds of data feeds. We are talking about price feeds and each price feed has your own contact address. And here we have the contact addresses and you can choose the network that you would like to see. Like I told you before, there are more networks here that in my slide they must update my slide.
00:57:49.040 - 00:58:16.410, Speaker A: We are on Ethereum, not mainnet. We are on Ethereum. Checking the right side, you can choose sepolia testnet. And here we are on sepolia testnet. Remember that I'm using the it in USD. So this is the address that I should have in my content. Let's see, I will copy it.
00:58:16.410 - 00:58:49.004, Speaker A: And here it's the same address. How good. So an aggregator interface. It's an interface that I will use with an address of price feed that I delight to use. Then I create another token interface. I could simply import my token, so. But I prefer to create a new interface.
00:58:49.004 - 00:59:23.630, Speaker A: Khaled token interface that has only the function mint. Because inside my Contract I will use only the function mint. And it's the same structure. This is the same structure that I have here. Mint address to integer amount. You can see here address account. I changed the name Uint, two, five, six amount and here it's public.
00:59:23.630 - 01:00:27.300, Speaker A: And when I migrate interfaces, they are external. Okay, and let's take a brief and let's see how is the faucet now guys, you are getting out the money. How is possible this? Unbelievable. Let's come back here. So now this is definition of the token shop itself and you can see that I have that interface and I create, I change this on my end for you because if it's in Terna you cannot check this later. And I prefer no, I call it more problems. No, maintain that now not create problems.
01:00:27.300 - 01:01:46.090, Speaker A: So the aggregator interface, I colored price feed, the token interface I colored minter and here are the definitions of my token shop. So this is the shop to buy my token I have the token price that I define $2 remember that I have two decimal places and I may also getting and saving on my contract the address of the owner in the way that we did yesterday, the constructor when I'm creating this token, I must pass a parameter, the token address so I can use the same token shop and create token shops to different tokens, for example. And because of this I ask you to not deploy yet. We must do this together. And here I have the minter. I'm defining that the minter is the token interface with my token address. With this I can mint tokens.
01:01:46.090 - 01:02:15.490, Speaker A: Now to review this part again, I know that someone asked me to do this. I am in the network sepolia this is a comment. Another way to create a comment. I'm using the aggregator ET USD and this is the address where this address came from. I came here and I can edit this for you as well. It's here. Let's go here because it's sepolia.
01:02:15.490 - 01:03:08.840, Speaker A: I'm not sure about this now I will go forward. Let's see if someone in this chat can help you and let's go here. So this is only a comment here. The price feed is remember that this is the aggregator interface. So I'm defining the aggregator interface with that address, the ETH USD and the owner is my content by the way maybe or you copy the content wrong or you are not on the injected provider. One of these two options, okay. And this is the token shop.
01:03:08.840 - 01:03:37.726, Speaker A: I have more things over there. So this is only the definition. This is executed when we are deploying. Let's understand more. Let's get the response from the price feed. So we have this huge naming function, but this is good. Get chain link data feed latest answer and I can get more information over there.
01:03:37.726 - 01:05:02.300, Speaker A: I only needed the price so remember that my price aggregator it's the price feed. So get the price feed latest rounded data and return the price is this token amount I'm calculating if I have some amount of it, how many tokens can I buy is this so token amount, I pass the parameter, the amount of it that I'm sending, I'd like to send to the content. And using you get the quote of eating USD and disease with eight decimal places. Then you calculate the amount of USD that I have with this amount of it. It's only multiply one by the other and divide by the 18 decimal places from it. And then to discover my amount of tokens, okay, I have this amount of it, my token price divided by the token price, and again divided by the decimal places. This is a complex part, but I will not go so deeply on this.
01:05:02.300 - 01:05:43.590, Speaker A: And finally you get the amount of tokens, okay, this is a so special function. Pay attention on this. This is a special function on solidity. All the versions don't have this function and this is the receiving function. This is a default from solidity now. And this is a payable function. It means that I'm allowing my contract to receive it if I don't have this receive function.
01:05:43.590 - 01:06:50.378, Speaker A: If I don't have any payable function inside my content, I can't receive it on my content. If someone sends it to my contact, you beverted Jesus in older versions of solidity could have and we have a lot of it. Like lost it, burned it inside contacts, because that contact receive it, but was not prepared to withdraw them. So we have a lot of it that is locked inside concepts in the past, okay? And because of this we have dispayable and when you don't have anemia function to receive some money, if you send some it directly to the address of your content. The default function, you handle this. So this receive a function, you be called. This is the default.
01:06:50.378 - 01:07:49.662, Speaker A: If I send some it directly to the address of my contact. We are doing this later. Wait, what happened when I sent? I will get the message value. Remember the message owner, the address who send the transaction. The message value is the amount of it that you send in that transaction. And you get the token amount, that calculation with the value that was sent. And then my minter, this is my token will mint for the sender who is sending the transaction, that amount of tokens, okay? My content, my token shop is receiving it.
01:07:49.662 - 01:08:39.034, Speaker A: It will have a lot of it at the end. So I prepared my contact to withdraw this it I can withdraw out the it that my contact receive. In order to do this, I uturn from the address of my contract out the balance for to the owner of the contract. And in order to the owner receive, the owner must be payable as well. We are converting here. And by the way, only the owner can do this. In fact, because I'm transferring to the owner, anyone could try to withdraw and is going to the owner.
01:08:39.034 - 01:09:38.420, Speaker A: But I prefer to be sure that only the owner can do this. So I have the modifier only owner checking if the message of sender of a transaction is the owner. If it is, continue the code. Okay, this is the token shop, I think now we are ready to deploy. You collapse this so in order, be careful here, because my token shop is not the first contract that appear here. So let's take this part off now on contract, select token shop, not token interfaces. I don't remember.
01:09:38.420 - 01:10:15.550, Speaker A: Yes, not token interface. Then the parameter is your token address and then deploy. Let's see, let's see. First you do and then you can do. Here contract. I have a list and I change to token shop. I selected the token shop.
01:10:15.550 - 01:11:03.016, Speaker A: Now in order to deploy, I must pass the address of my token. Let's get it here. Copy and paste. And now I can deploy. Confirm and I'm waiting. And you know what you need to do now? Name me and token shop address mine. This is so this is my token shop.
01:11:03.016 - 01:11:54.246, Speaker A: Let's take a look on the chat a bit. Andrea. No, the farming will be open to you until at least one week later the boot camp finished. Because you can do this later, no problem. Okay, and what more? And this is, I'm not sure. No, you don't need to change nothing inside my content. I only demonstrate to you that I'm using the right content.
01:11:54.246 - 01:12:56.210, Speaker A: Okay, don't change enough. Okay, let's see, how are you? And I need to drink thing about some address, some links at the beginning, I add here the two videos, session one, session two. The slides are here, the form are here, the faucet are here. So I think you have everything that you need for now. Hello, economic beats. You didn't pay attention on this. Pay attention.
01:12:56.210 - 01:14:10.890, Speaker A: Now you must select token shopping, not the token interface. Your problem is that you have the token interface over there. How can you do this here? Deploy and run transactions contract. Select the token shopping here. Okay, next step, you have the token shop. Do you think that your token shop is able to mink tokens just now? It. What do you think? Yes or no? Maybe? In fact, I can tell you no, the token shopping cannot mint tokens now because it is not authorized inside the token.
01:14:10.890 - 01:15:31.370, Speaker A: So I must authorize the token because remember that the token has roles, okay? And because I have the minter role in order to a wallet account, wallet, your wallet, or another smart contract, mint tokens this address must be in the minted role. How can we do this for you, Marina? Check first of all, if you have the auto compile selected. Because if not, maybe the version will be different here. If yes, you have it. Check if you copy the beginning and the end because this will be a problem for you. Okay, you have two points to check it and let's come back here. So I came back to the token.
01:15:31.370 - 01:16:02.270, Speaker A: On token, we must first understand what is the minted role. The minted role. You can get the minted role here. Minted role. You can see this hash. This is the hash of the minted role. Wait a minute.
01:16:02.270 - 01:16:47.544, Speaker A: So I have the hash of the minted roll and where I'm using this. I'm using this on grant role. On grant role. We are using the role. The role is this. And the account is your token shop address. Let's do it.
01:16:47.544 - 01:18:00.430, Speaker A: Minter hole. So expand the grant roll it to be easy. This is the role. The account is the address of my token shop. Let's scroll down and get the address of my token shop and paste here and project it. Confirming. So what I did, I authorized the token shops to mint tokens.
01:18:00.430 - 01:18:24.300, Speaker A: Okay, is this. Now I'm ready to buy tokens. I like this question. Kiss fort. I got it here. I defined it here. Wait, it was defined here.
01:18:24.300 - 01:18:44.240, Speaker A: And if I go to the token shop itself. Deploy endurance transactions. Token shop. Token shopping. Sorry. Token. If you go to the blue bottoms, this is only a view.
01:18:44.240 - 01:19:03.050, Speaker A: In fact, it's a constant. You can get the minter role here. Okay. Okay. So this was for Kisford and Daniel. I just did. Okay.
01:19:03.050 - 01:19:43.060, Speaker A: Go to your token, scroll down into the blue buttons and find the minter role. Perfect. So let's be sure that confirm it. To confirm it, I go to has rope. And this here. It's a blue bottom has hole. And it's the same.
01:19:43.060 - 01:20:02.460, Speaker A: Let's try that. The same. The result must be true. Let's see. So now I am on rest role. I'm confirming if this is working. Okay.
01:20:02.460 - 01:20:44.490, Speaker A: Minter role is here account. Remember that it's my token shop address and call. Yes, it's true. It means that my token shopping now is able to mint tokens. And so let's do it. Perfect. What do you do now? Go to Metamask and send zero point.
01:20:44.490 - 01:20:58.136, Speaker A: No, not yet. Not yet. Wait. And go to token shop. I'm anxious to do this. But let's explain a bit more. Let's go to the token shopping.
01:20:58.136 - 01:21:18.980, Speaker A: Now I can close this. Go to the token shop. And check a bit. What is the token price? $2. I am the owner. The minter is my token. And the get chain, minky feet.
01:21:18.980 - 01:21:56.220, Speaker A: This is the price of eating USD. Now. So for example, if I go here, can be a bit different, but it's something like that. And we have eight decimal places when we receive this. Two, four. So this is the Ethereum price thing. This is the price.
01:21:56.220 - 01:22:46.198, Speaker A: Okay, I'd like to send 0.1 each to my contract, but here I must prepare the amount in weight, the minimal units of Ethereum. So amount will be zero, zero, one, eat. And this is equal to some amount of weight. Wait a bit. Convey here, let's share this with you. And are you saying 0.1?
01:22:46.198 - 01:23:32.060, Speaker A: This is equal to this amount of way. And the way is the minimal unit of Ethereum. And remember, Ethereum has 18 decimal places. If it's bitcoin. Bitcoin has eight decimal places. Okay, so this is the value that I must use here. So run token amount with this value, and then you discover the amount of tokens that you can receive.
01:23:32.060 - 01:23:58.010, Speaker A: Token amount. This is a blue function. We are not changing the blockchain. Change the state of the content. It's only queries. Okay, okay, here we are. With that amount of it, you receive this.
01:23:58.010 - 01:24:47.864, Speaker A: So sending this, I will receive it. The result is this. You receive twelve point 26 tokens. Remember that when token is $2. Okay, is this. Now we know how many tokens we are receiving. And if I go to my metamask now, remember that I have you 100.
01:24:47.864 - 01:25:27.572, Speaker A: Yes, I have you 100. This must be increased at some number like this. Okay, now, yes, go to metamask and send zero 118 to your token shop address. Let's do it. First of all, get my token shop address. Copy it. You can see here that I don't have any it in my token shop.
01:25:27.572 - 01:25:57.930, Speaker A: Okay, go to Metamask and send like you did in the first class, that we send tokens to other wallets. Now we are sending tokens to a smart contract and they smart content. You do something with this. You mint tokens too. In fact. So this is the address of my token shop. I'm saying zero one.
01:25:57.930 - 01:26:30.600, Speaker A: Next. And confirm this explanation. Christopher. Yes. Way is the denomination of eater. Like we have saints to a dollar. Saints is the minimum of a dollar and the way is the minimum of it.
01:26:30.600 - 01:27:07.110, Speaker A: Great. I think it's done. I sent submit to my content. Let's see if I have more tokens now. Here we are, 1226. Now I have 112. 26 tokens.
01:27:07.110 - 01:27:40.500, Speaker A: Can I see this in another place. Yes. If I go to check your token balance on metamask or on balance off. Let's do it on balance off as well. Get my address. Go to the token. Not the token shop.
01:27:40.500 - 01:28:11.290, Speaker A: Go to the balance off. And here you can see that increase it as well. Now let's think about. Let's interact with our friends. I can't mint directly tokens in your contract. Okay? But I can buy your token. So now I choose someone to buy tokens.
01:28:11.290 - 01:28:43.180, Speaker A: Christopher, you are talking with me. Can I find your content here? Your token shop content? Are you here? Let's find it. Or no, are you doing. Yes, I found you. Let's see. I think it's this. So this is Christopher Token shop.
01:28:43.180 - 01:29:21.116, Speaker A: And now I'm interacting with his comprot. Okay, let's add something different. This is the token shop, and I'd like to get the token as well. So I think this is your token. Let's see. Token address token is this. Let's see.
01:29:21.116 - 01:29:56.310, Speaker A: What happened? Are you buy Christopher token now? First of all, I add his token on my metamask wallet. Tokens import tokens. It seems that this is not a token. Sorry, Christopher, I can't use yours. Who else? Kiss 40. Did you did it? Let's see. It seems not.
01:29:56.310 - 01:30:30.102, Speaker A: Or what's your name? I'd like to buy a token. Who did it? Let's try with someone roundo in the list. Okay. Where are you, Augustine? Yes, let's see, Augustine. Here you are. I think this is your token. Okay, I have two more over there.
01:30:30.102 - 01:30:53.630, Speaker A: Yes, I can interact with you as well. And so, Token. Great. Are you interacting with you as well? Don't worry, token shops. If you have a different name in the token, it'd be better for me. And probably. This is the token shops.
01:30:53.630 - 01:31:24.694, Speaker A: Now is the playtime. Let's be fun. So, are you at Augustine Token inside Metamask? Oh, Augustine, this is not a token. Let's try this. Who are you? TB. Maybe the problem with Metamask. I'm not sure if the problem is with you.
01:31:24.694 - 01:31:54.800, Speaker A: Yes, this is working. So, Augustine, there is something wrong in your token as well. Okay, I'm doing. What's your name here? GBG. What's your name? I'm doing yours. You can see that this is the GBG two decimal places import team. Okay, you get your team.
01:31:54.800 - 01:32:21.210, Speaker A: And you can see that I don't have any token now. So I'm buying your token now. This is your token shop. I'm going directly to send 0.1 each to you. Maybe your token. You may make me rich in the future.
01:32:21.210 - 01:33:04.758, Speaker A: I don't know. And this is interesting comment from Christopher. Christopher, I know that is hard. Out of these concepts and out of this knowledge is hard to learn and especially doing this in an intensive way. I know that your brain will be so full and don't hold if you need to watch more than once. But this is important. I'm so proud of you because you did it again and again until you could do this.
01:33:04.758 - 01:33:34.330, Speaker A: And this is really amazing. And let's see. Tim, I bought your token. Yes, I have 1226 gbg token. Amazing. And tin. If you check your token shopping now, you will discover that you have some money over there and I forgot.
01:33:34.330 - 01:33:52.486, Speaker A: Just share this with you online. Look at my token shopping now. Oh, another person buy my token. I'm rich. I have zero point 40 now because you are buying my token. I'm so happy. This is really amazing.
01:33:52.486 - 01:34:41.362, Speaker A: How can I discover this as well? This is really amazing. If we go to the token now, probably you can see that the token supply increases by 40 90 because four people buy the token. And if I know who bought the token, I can get the balance off. Or if I monitor the events of the token, I could do this. I'm not doing the iteration part today, but if we do it, we can monitor the events as well. Is that to do the iteration part, we must do some advanced topics inside iterisca. And this is a bit complex for today.
01:34:41.362 - 01:35:03.180, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah. But I'd like to buy one more. I'm so happy with you. So who is this? Let's see if it's okay. Andrea. Andrea. How you do your as well? Let's do two more.
01:35:03.180 - 01:35:30.610, Speaker A: First of all, discover if you have a token. This is the TKT token. What's your name? Here? I stopped in the middle. Let's do it again. Next, import TK one. Okay. TK one.
01:35:30.610 - 01:36:16.876, Speaker A: Are you buy yours also? Are you buy the tacta token under you? Let's buy yours as well. So I have two tokens more to buy. So I'm going to the aim token shop. Sorry if I'm not saying your name right. Please add it to me. Okay. Andrea, you did like a burner to buy your token.
01:36:16.876 - 01:36:48.448, Speaker A: So why you buy more? We have you one here painting. But I can add the next transaction as well. So let's 0.2 for you. Andre, I think metamask is low. Probably only after confirming the other transaction. I you tell Metamask guys about this? Yes, confirm it.
01:36:48.448 - 01:37:03.960, Speaker A: The one now. Probably I can do the other. Not yet. Come on. Let's see first what's happened. So I have the TK one token 1226. Let's try now.
01:37:03.960 - 01:37:46.006, Speaker A: The tacta token 0.2. I like the name of your token. Oh, come on. What happened? Sometimes this happened because sepali is trying to metamask is trying to estimate something. If I put off and one again because of this, no conversion rate available. When you have this, you close the address and paste again. Now you can do it.
01:37:46.006 - 01:38:31.664, Speaker A: Okay, this is a trick with metamask, but I'm buying only 0.2. Now it. Oh, no, I am not speed up. Let's wait. Yeah, Christopher, I totally agree with you. And I may try to be slow in the class. I know that I'm slower than other teachers, but if I go, it's hard as well to you to watch later, especially because you have this kind of interactions live.
01:38:31.664 - 01:39:12.236, Speaker A: So I must try to go in a speed that is not too fast, but not too slow as well. But in the same time, I know that you have the ability to see the video later. So if you could not do everything live, you can do later. Another big challenge that maybe you have and I don't have it. I have two screens, so I may sharing one screen and I may seeing you in the order. Okay, but if you have only one screen and you must alternate between the video, between the remix, between the pad. It's hard.
01:39:12.236 - 01:39:45.948, Speaker A: It's really hard. And I understand that we have some challenges doing our in the same time and with this huge amount of new knowledgement. So it's a challenge for our few. But we are here for ten days and you can repeat and repeat until everything is good. Okay, I'm so proud of you. All of you. Fail it angry.
01:39:45.948 - 01:40:12.176, Speaker A: You did the out of this. But probably there are some problem over there. Let's get your problem, because I tried to find the problem. This can be useful for you as well. I'm getting our token first, let's go to remix. Select the token, use the ET address with the tacta token. Close it is.
01:40:12.176 - 01:40:51.720, Speaker A: Close it is. So this is your token and you minted the first 100, but you didn't mint more. Okay, probably you didn't allow your token shop to mint tokens. Okay, let's see if this is your problem. So now you get your token shop. Andrew. Select the token shop, paste in that address and add it here to interact.
01:40:51.720 - 01:41:11.510, Speaker A: But I did wrong. You did this before. I did now I did the token interface, not the token shop. I'm wrong. Remove this, select the token shop. And now I'm doing this right. Token shop.
01:41:11.510 - 01:41:32.680, Speaker A: This is your token shop. Okay? And you have enough. What's your problem? Let's see. Let's copy your token shop again. Go to your token and see the household. This is the address of your token shop. This is the minted role.
01:41:32.680 - 01:42:04.516, Speaker A: And this is your problem, Andrew. You didn't authorize the token shop to mint tokens. What you must do now, go to your token, expand the grant role. And did the same. Add the minter role here. Add your token shop address here and authorize us to buy your token. We cannot buy now because of this.
01:42:04.516 - 01:42:32.430, Speaker A: Okay, you minted, but you didn't authorize the people to buy your token. You can't be reaching on this way. Do this part. Okay, so I think it's this, guys. Sorry that there are a lot of tokens. I will be so happy by all of your tokens. But I think it will be so long to do this.
01:42:32.430 - 01:43:05.240, Speaker A: But okay, let's. Andrew, the minter role is this. If you go to your token, scroll down here, you have the minter role. Okay, here is the minted role. And I will see what is the role. You can define your orders. In our case, you define the minted role.
01:43:05.240 - 01:43:54.756, Speaker A: So, I'm finishing today. We have some announcements for you. Like, remember to share in the networks that are you doing the chain link bootcamp 2024.
