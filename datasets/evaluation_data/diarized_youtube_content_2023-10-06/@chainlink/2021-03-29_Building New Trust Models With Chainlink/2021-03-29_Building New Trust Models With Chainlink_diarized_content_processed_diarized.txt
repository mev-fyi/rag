00:00:01.850 - 00:01:16.020, Speaker A: For the first time in history, if somebody fails in their ability to provide trust to their users, the users look for an alternative through the Internet, through YouTube, through Wikipedia, through Twitter, through all these informational channels. And what they will find increasingly through the combination of blockchain oracles and the applications that use those two technologies is an alternative. And the only thing stopping them from adopting that alternative is that they don't know about it and or that the alternative for their specific situation hasn't been built yet. But once again, the big, big difference between now and every other time in history is that it can be built. We can build a lottery that is provably fair and can't be gamed by anybody. We can build a financial product that doesn't asymmetrically benefit large hedge funds to the detriment of small holders of small asset holders, or the larger market. We can build insurance regardless of whether a large insurance company decides to provide insurance to a geography or doesn't decide to provide it.
00:01:16.020 - 00:02:00.540, Speaker A: And this is the amazing thing that I think we're all involved in and that I'm super excited to see come out of this hackathon and what you can build here. Because if somebody here can build the next generation of a vertical or of a use case, or they can improve defi, or they can improve insurance, or they can improve how NFTs are generated using VRF, then that is an important incremental step towards this alternate world that is fair and is transparent and doesn't care where you are, where you're born, or where you live. All you need is access to the Internet and the willingness to participate in an agreement which I think will level the playing field across the world.
