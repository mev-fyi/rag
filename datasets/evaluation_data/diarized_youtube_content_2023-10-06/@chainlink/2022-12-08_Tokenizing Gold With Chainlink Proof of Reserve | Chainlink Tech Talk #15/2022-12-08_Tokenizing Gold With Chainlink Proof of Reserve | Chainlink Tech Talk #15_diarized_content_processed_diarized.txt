00:00:09.610 - 00:00:35.794, Speaker A: Welcome in, everybody. Welcome to Chainlink Tech Talk 15. My name is Max Meltzer. I am the go to market lead for Chainlink proof of reserve. I'm excited to be discussing tokenized gold today with Chainlink proof of reserve, specifically highlighting cash and their cash gold token. We are a very fortunate to have Diaz Lampone, CTO of cash, to provide a deep dive into the cash gold token and specifically how they're working with Chainlink proof of reserve. Good morning, Diaz.
00:00:35.794 - 00:00:36.438, Speaker A: Welcome.
00:00:36.604 - 00:00:39.740, Speaker B: Hi, folks. How's everyone doing?
00:00:40.510 - 00:01:17.026, Speaker A: Thanks, Max, for having me. Yeah, great. Before we get into the deep dive on cash and their operations with Chainlink proof reserve, we're going to provide some background on tokenized assets. And so what I want to bring up is off chain assets that are tokenized. If we think about the tokens we interact with today, there are those that are native to the chain, like ether and bitcoin. And then there are those that are representations of assets held off chain or cross chain. So examples of this would be like a fiat backed stablecoin, where the reserves are dollars in a bank account.
00:01:17.026 - 00:01:57.294, Speaker A: It could be something like wrap bitcoin on Ethereum, where the reserves are on bitcoin and it's represented on Ethereum. And it can also be like, we'll talk about today, tokenized gold, where the representation is backed by gold bars in a vault. There's some others listed here, financial instruments, precious metals, real estate, art, sustainable assets like carbon credits. These are also known as RWAs, or real world assets. There are a number of benefits to utilizing these real world assets. There's liquidity, transparency, composability. These assets that exist in the real world can now interact with DeFi protocols.
00:01:57.294 - 00:02:37.354, Speaker A: They can be accessible to anyone across the world who has access to the blockchain. And they're most importantly, transparent. You can see who they've been transferred to, how they've been utilized, and there's a immutable record of history on the blockchain. These assets also carry risk in that many times they have a single issuer, and that issuer has substantial control over the asset on chain. You can't see natively if that asset is still backed one to one, or if there's any reserves at all. And that leads us to proof of reserve. So with any product, I think it's important that you identify the solution and the problem you're really trying to solve.
00:02:37.354 - 00:03:17.770, Speaker A: And today we've identified that there is a large reliance on these asset issuers and inherent trust assumptions. With these tokenized assets, they control the asset they can admit more, they can burn. And so, in many ways, this control and this trust devalues a lot of the security principles of blockchain and decentralized finance. So Chainlink proof of reserve aims to minimize these trust assumptions. And we do that by bringing reserve data for these assets on chain. So both the asset issuer DeFi protocols and general users can see at all times that the assets they carry are backed one to one. Great.
00:03:17.770 - 00:03:46.254, Speaker A: I think this is a great diagram to kind of illustrate what proof of reserve does. This case is an off chain to on chain use case. We can see that the chainlink network monitors the reserve balance of a given asset vault. Again, this could be US dollars, this could be gold. Could be really anything. Whenever that reserve balance changes, the Chainlink node network comes to consensus on what the new value is and updates the on chain contract. We talk about the benefits of this.
00:03:46.254 - 00:04:25.414, Speaker A: I think the last three months really give us great insight into why this is important. By putting reserve data on chain at all times, we can reduce insolvency risk. There's no waiting for a monthly audit to come out where your buddies with the auditor, it's not as expensive as a traditional audit. It improves transparency for the users, because at all times they can see on chain that the asset is backed one to one. It also prevents systemic failures in Defi. So we're going to get into a bit more detail on the three parties that are involved here in the next slide on the token issuer front with proof of reserve. What we're really trying to do is set a standard for all of these tokenized assets.
00:04:25.414 - 00:05:09.020, Speaker A: And we're doing that by having these asset issuers reference the proof of reserve feed in their minting function. So one use case is to say transparently, we can only mint what an independent set of validators says we have in our reserves. That's one use case for token issuers, for Defi app developers. If you're accepting an asset that's backed by off chain reserves, you want to know if that asset is still backed one to one. You can think of incidents like infinite minattacks, or even when assets on the reserve have disappeared and now are not backed. You don't want to continue accepting that asset into your platform. So utilizing proof of reserve as a DeFi protocol, you can verify the collateral, and you can affect your protocol's operations based on that information.
00:05:09.020 - 00:05:42.770, Speaker A: The last thing we mentioned this before is for token holders, if you're holding. I guess one of the things I like about DeFi is that it's a free market, and if you have two assets of equal value, but one of them is backed by proof of reserve, and you can see at all times the collateral back in that asset, I think it's a simple choice for users on which one they want to hold day to day. With that brief background, we're going to take advantage of our time with Diaz and get into some questions. Diaz, just to start off, I would love to know a bit more about your role at cash and what led you to working in blockchain.
00:05:46.090 - 00:06:14.606, Speaker B: Well, I take care of all the technology. I'm accountable for technology at cash and the strategy for that. Maybe I can introduce a bit about how I got into blockchain as well. So I started in the blockchain space with Balaji's course on startup engineering, because back then we had a startup and no clue on how to kind of do the engineering for it. So it was very timely, the course. And as part of the course, it was kind of mandatory that you do this project on bitcoin. Right.
00:06:14.606 - 00:07:07.294, Speaker B: So I did this kind of like crowdfunding site or something, using bitcoin to pass the course, and that's how I got in touch with bitcoin. And then I met a co founder. We actually created the first kind of like fractionalized gold system back then, and at that point, we used bitbit, which is now Paxos as the liquidity provider and silver Boolean as our storage provider. So I'll get into a bit why I talk about them, but it's kind of interesting. Back then, we used op return on the bitcoin blockchain to kind of create this fractionalized gold system. But I think we were too early back then. So that's kind of like my introduction to the space and then have been still learning, still working, still participating in hackathon, still very active, and having fun in the space.
00:07:07.294 - 00:07:08.880, Speaker B: Yeah, that's me.
00:07:09.810 - 00:07:21.074, Speaker A: That's awesome. Would love to know a bit more about cash too, for the audience as well. We know it's a token issuer of CGT, but we'd love to know, too, a bit more about the organization's. Right?
00:07:21.112 - 00:08:00.466, Speaker B: Sure, Mike. So cash was spun off from silver bullion. Like I kind of mentioned them before. So silver bullion is basically building one of the world's largest walls here in Singapore with a capacity of 15,000 tons. They're basically a boolean dealer, and cash was kind of for them at that point. It was like something that needs to be done basically into the digital space, right? Because they saw a lot of people like us trying to use it to make our own fractionalized gold. And they were the people who had the know how because they were attached to the boolean industry and they were attached to the physical asset industry rather than people who were not from this space.
00:08:00.466 - 00:08:31.146, Speaker B: So silver Boolean spun off cash in 2019. And what cash does is basically it's an infrastructure layer that converts physical items such as gold into the digital space. Right. And cash right now we have co walls. We utilize four walls. So it's not our walls, but because we are just like the infrastructure there in between, we utilize vaults across three continents. So we have vaults in Zurich with.
00:08:31.146 - 00:08:48.340, Speaker B: Right. We have a vault in Frankfurt. Again, Loomis. We have Ids from the US. Dylan Gage. So we kind of have these partner walls and then the vault operators directly operate together with us and we have instilled our software with them and things like that.
00:08:49.350 - 00:09:02.840, Speaker A: That's awesome. I think gold plays an interesting role with monetary policy in many ways. There's a strong correlation to cryptocurrency. But I'm curious, why gold? And are there plans to list other commodities in the future?
00:09:03.530 - 00:09:25.914, Speaker B: Yeah. So gold, I think, has been like the store of value for millennia. Right. If you think about it, with the changes in monetary policy, gold just came out of it into fiat currency quite recently. Right. And then it's just like in the last decade that we have cryptocurrency maybe 20 years back. We have Internet and we have virtual currencies and things like that.
00:09:25.914 - 00:09:31.600, Speaker B: So gold is trusted by a lot of people. So it's kind of, like, hard to take away the trust.
00:09:33.330 - 00:09:33.966, Speaker A: And it has.
00:09:33.988 - 00:09:46.514, Speaker B: That store of value feature. Right. The only problem with gold is that it's physical. It's really heavy in the walls. We have a lot of gold, and it's quite dense and heavy. It's not something that you can butter with or trade with. It's not something that you can carry around with.
00:09:46.514 - 00:10:13.414, Speaker B: Right. But tokenized gold, with its properties of having it on the blockchain, having a ledger that's public and that's distributed and that's immutable, I think those are important properties to make that physical asset, to kind of maintain the properties of that physical asset at the same time making it liquid. So that means in the current generation, we kind of don't even want to carry cash in our pocket.
00:10:13.462 - 00:10:13.962, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:14.096 - 00:10:55.130, Speaker B: Although I would say that's pretty good thing to do, but let alone gold. Right? Yeah. So I think tokenized gold was, like, for us, I think it's a way to go back to the basics, to have a transparent layer that kind of converts that physical asset into digital. So to, I mean, you can see in the last we had GFC, now we have another crisis coming upon us. So in all of these, where do you go back to? It's one of the natural Tendencies to go back to what worked for Centuries.
00:10:56.350 - 00:11:15.920, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think there's a lot of Ties to other Cryptocurrencies in that Respect as well. The tokenized gold landscape, it's growing. And I think a Lot of People may be familiar with Paxus's PaX G and Tether's Tether gold. What makes CGT or cash gold token different from those?
00:11:22.210 - 00:11:59.790, Speaker B: So it's kind of interesting because for me, I'm kind of familiar with Paxos. When they were early on, I had to talk to a lot of their Teams, team members. So it's kind of interesting for me. But other than that, what kind of differentiates paxos, Pax gold and tether gold from cash is we are quite simple. We use something called a cash gold explorer. What that does is it kind of creates like a real time audit possibility for anybody. It's a public system that anybody can audit.
00:11:59.790 - 00:12:35.430, Speaker B: You can see how many tokens are there. You can see how much tokens got redeemed. You can see how much actual physical gold is in which vault there, what's the brand, what's the amount of weight in it, what's the purity, what's the serial number of that specific bar? Whereas, for example, in pax g or tether gold, the touch with the boolean space is missing. Right? Because these guys, I think they're not from the boolean space. So to say they're from more like the fintech space, right. So what happens is that you don't get clarity into. You get periodic attestations.
00:12:35.430 - 00:13:09.762, Speaker B: Attestations or auditing is like a secondary thing. If you see the audit reports, you don't get to know if it's troy ounces or ounces. So there's a lot of missing links in the attestations and audits. Whereas for us it's on real time, it's auditable anytime. You can just go into the explorer, see how much gold is there, and you can tally it with the actual CGT that's minted. Right. That proof of reserve and with Chainlink's proof of reserve system.
00:13:09.762 - 00:13:25.580, Speaker B: So that kind of ties up as a completely auditable system, real time. So I think that's very different, whereas in Paxg and tether the attestations are published like days later. So it's a bit different from the very beginning, right?
00:13:28.030 - 00:13:58.820, Speaker A: Yeah, no, absolutely. That's a great answer. I'm curious because with any of these real world assets, there's clearly a cost associated with running the business, maintaining the asset. I imagine for a gold token you need a vault, need management, security, auditing costs. I think it's important that these real world assets are transparent about their commercial model. Is it possible for you to maybe give some details on how CSGT manages their finances and specifically pays for the reserve vaults and such?
00:13:59.750 - 00:14:37.226, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So for us, we wanted to make everything sustainable from kind of like the day one. So what we do is that we start storage fees at 25 basis points. We did have transfer fees, but we made a business decision to remove it for now. We had a ten basis point transfer fee as well. So the storage fee is for us the main way that we kind of see how we can monetize this, because for us, storing that physical gold, it does occupy space. You need to pay the wall providers some capital.
00:14:37.226 - 00:14:54.142, Speaker B: Right. Users don't like fees, especially today. Everybody likes to see the numbers. Very nice. But at the end of the day, these are physical items. These physical items cost storage, especially in jurisdictions that are friendly. They're even more expensive.
00:14:54.142 - 00:15:33.514, Speaker B: Right? It is expensive. We basically have the business model to charge for storage fees and transfer fees. We also charge like a 50 basis point for redemption. So if you want to redeem your bar, you have to pay a bit higher. So these are the three fees and these fees are transparent. They're visible on the blockchain. You can audit it, you can see when we changed it and everything is completely visible now just to kind of point out, because we made this decision to be very transparent about the storage piece, whereas for example, you take PaX G or tether gold, it isn't very clear how they cover storage.
00:15:33.514 - 00:15:49.190, Speaker B: Right. Or audit and insurance, because they kind of say it was free storage. So I'm not really sure about that. That's about us and how we charge fees.
00:15:49.770 - 00:16:15.758, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in light of recent events, more users are asking for what happens behind the scenes. And a company's commercial model is important to know, especially in the real world asset tokenization process. I think it'd be interesting to know if I came to you with a gold bar, if I had one. What's the process like to get that on chain? Can you walk me through the steps? Is that even feasible? How would that work? Yeah.
00:16:15.924 - 00:16:36.486, Speaker B: If we could pull up the explorer, I could kind of show you as well. Thanks. Here. Basically, this is what the cash gold Explorer looks like. It's kind of like taking data from a gram chain system. We can get to that in a bit. But what happens here is that let's say you come to the cash gold website and you log in and you can then verify yourself.
00:16:36.486 - 00:17:05.038, Speaker B: After you've done the verification, you can actually tokenize physical gold. So if you come with, let's say like 100 grams bar. So we only do 100 grams and one kilo bars. So let's say you come with one kilo bar, right? So what happens is that you take this to the partner vault, whichever one is located next to you. So the cash gold site will walk you through the steps. You come to the partner vault, you deposit the piece of gold inside the vault. Then what happens is the gram chain system kind of takes over.
00:17:05.038 - 00:17:40.730, Speaker B: So the vault operator has like an RFID scanner and a testing machine. So he tests like, is this real physical gold? Right? And each of these events, like the gold arriving has like an event broadcasted. So if you could scroll down a bit on the parcel history, you can see this, like, okay, this bar of gold has come into the vault. So there's a wall scan, right? And then after the wall scan is done, the vault operator themselves tests it and then kind of assigns it to cash, right? And in this, if you scroll up, you can see. If you scroll up, you can see like, okay, this is 99.9 grams of gold. It is of triple four purity.
00:17:40.730 - 00:18:11.662, Speaker B: And who's a refiner? All this information is stored as metadata. This metadata is then hashed. And for each of these bars, we broadcast events. All these events are broadcast onto the chain, right? So there's always like this immutable data of what happened with your gold bar or whoever brings it in. And once all this is done, what we do is the vault operator locks it to cache. From there, cache can take it forward. So now it's like we are in the infrastructure layer of cache.
00:18:11.662 - 00:18:31.500, Speaker B: So cache, we have our own backend system. So we just say, okay, lock this bar. And once we lock the bar, the gram chain system picks it up. That cache has locked this bar. And then what happens is that it emits the data to chain link. Sorry, not to chain link, but chain link nodes. And the chain link nodes pick it up.
00:18:31.500 - 00:19:20.534, Speaker B: Gram chain is an independent system. So the chain link nodes pick this up. That, okay, this much grams of gold has been allocated to cash. And after that we can then proceed to mint, right? Because now using the chain link proof of reserve, this data is in the proof of reserve and it's broadcasted on chain. Then our token using that can mint up to that amount of tokens. So we mint that amount of tokens and then in your cash gold profile you can actually then put in your ethereum address and then we can then send those tokens to you. So you would get CGT to the Ethereum address that you kind of specified on your profile.
00:19:20.534 - 00:19:30.000, Speaker B: So that's how new cash gold tokens get issued. That's the kind of like happy to take questions later on this.
00:19:31.170 - 00:19:59.686, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we may have some questions on that at the end. For me personally, you think about gold vaults and gold bars, you think about them stacked up maybe in a pyramid. I did not know until using your explorer that they're all QR code and bags. That makes a lot more sense. On that note, if I were to want to redeem gold that I say I bought CGT on uniswap, does the reverse work as well? Am I able to redeem through you guys as well? Yeah, of course.
00:19:59.708 - 00:20:42.310, Speaker B: So if you look at our chain, if you look at the data from our system, you would see a lot of redemptions, right? So people have been using gold to trade and with comparison with for example Ethereum price going up, so they would trade on uniswap and whenever they make sufficient trades they want to retrieve physical, they actually do a redemption. So you can again log into the site, do your verification. Once you're verified you can actually just deposit. So again we use the same explorer so that you can choose which bars you want to retrieve. And depending on how much cgt you have, you can then redeem the go token. Sorry, the go bar. So yeah you can.
00:20:42.310 - 00:20:47.606, Speaker B: And then we have a few options. We can ship it to you or you can come to the vault and.
00:20:47.628 - 00:20:48.360, Speaker A: Pick it.
00:20:52.010 - 00:20:57.370, Speaker B: Know, so we have it in Dallas, Zurich, Frankfurt, Dubai and Singapore.
00:20:58.510 - 00:21:20.130, Speaker A: I might have to try that out myself just to see an option. That's incredible. You touched on gram chain and how it provides real time reserve attestation. I'm curious, even in traditional finance we don't often see real time attestation. Why did cash decide to integrate chain link proof of reserve and provide this real time transparency when even in traditional finance this isn't a requirement.
00:21:21.590 - 00:21:45.162, Speaker B: Basically, I think for us it's like how to do this from scratch and to bring more enhanced transparency to the minting process. And that's why we integrated with Chainlink and the Chainlink reserve system as well. Because having this oracle, which is kind of like the Bloomberg of crypto, it gives us a strong value proposition, especially.
00:21:45.216 - 00:21:55.450, Speaker A: In the transparency we touched upon how you use the proof of reserve feed in your minting process. Can other Defi protocols use the cash gold proof of reserve feed?
00:21:55.870 - 00:22:38.586, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. You can use the proof of reserve feed to kind of verify. So let's say you have a DeFi protocol that's like a lending protocol or you're accepting CGT as collateral. You want to know that is the amount of gold actually there, and you can use the proof of reserve system in your Dap to kind of verify that. Is there enough supply? This is the supply. Is there enough gold backing that collateral? So you can actually just add this as a conditional and then you could verify it before either you have a circuit breaker or if it's a bridge, you know what to do. You can pause your contracts and things like that.
00:22:38.586 - 00:22:53.600, Speaker B: So I think it adds a lot of value for B, two B applications. And we kind of really would like to promote those applications and promote developers to make applications using CGT and the cash link proof of reserve system.
00:22:54.850 - 00:23:32.966, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for a lot of these protocols where they're multi pooled, one asset can affect the entire protocol. The ability to pause deposits based on the proof of reserve feed against the token supply is extremely valuable. You can even get into ideas where LTV ratio changes depending on your balance. So I think the opportunities are endless with this information. I want to ask about cash Gold token's future. You've integrated proof of reserve, you're on uniswap, you're on several other exchange platforms. Is there plan to incorporate with more defi? Is there plan to go multi chain? What do the next few months look like for cash gold token?
00:23:33.158 - 00:24:06.754, Speaker B: So there are a few things. One is we want to go multi chain. So we are actually right now internally testing polygon. We are already on Polygon. We're just testing it because we have our own system. We have on top of the Polygon bridge, we have kind of added some more contracts to make sure that we can do our own kind of control on it. Polygon is one we want to move into arbitrum, any chain that kind of has this kind of bridge where we can kind of have some control as a user.
00:24:06.754 - 00:24:40.000, Speaker B: So those are the main chains that we're looking at and then post that we hope to go on Zksync as well. These are some of the plans for the future as well as we want to do cash is not just about gold. We want to do other things. Like for example, you have a Rolex watch. So we want to make that into an NFT and then hopefully use the chain link proof of reserve system again to kind of like back it and then store that asset on chain. So those are some of the things.
00:24:40.710 - 00:25:14.794, Speaker A: I'm hoping you do. An airdrop with the Rolex watch Nft. But on a more serious note, I think we have time for some questions from the audience. Let's see. Okay, I see we have anonymous attendee that asked, can other companies use, I believe they mean gram chain. So can other asset issuers use gramchain? Is it exclusive for you? That's a good question, yeah.
00:25:14.832 - 00:26:02.506, Speaker B: So right now we prefer to use cash. So you'll have to ask the grandchain team on this a bit more. But for us, if you can use cache as the infrastructure layer. So what we do for queries like this is that you can lock. So if you see the explorer again, you can lock a bar to, let's say you're a company, right? Let's say you're company A. So in the explorer itself, if you see the safe house, like if you open the safe house, the first one, and if you open the first bar there, you can see on the right hand side a utilization by cash and it's locked by GSA, right. So GSA is you can go to goldsavingsaccount Singapore SG goldsavingsaccount SG if you can.
00:26:02.506 - 00:26:45.340, Speaker B: But it's basically a third company, third party company that wanted to do something similar. That means they wanted their own chain system. So what we did was they use CGT as the underlying and we can lock CGT for a particular specific bar just for you because we already built this infrastructure to use gram chain on top of cash. So instead of using gram chain directly, you can use cash as a gold bar. And we can lock particular gold bars to particular companies so nobody else can redeem it but you. So this gold bar is specifically allocated to GSA in this case. That's the way that we would kind of direct you to.
00:26:45.340 - 00:27:10.820, Speaker B: But of course you can also link up with, if you go to gramschain.net and link up with the team, there is the option that you could build on top of that infrastructure again. But again, once again we have built on top of gram chain, we have built all these surrounding infrastructure. So it might be easier and worth your time to just use cache as the underlying system.
00:27:12.790 - 00:27:38.154, Speaker A: That makes sense. No, I mean that's one of the benefits we mentioned earlier with the programmability of these off chain assets is that people can build on top of cash. It's a smart contract. Your platform could lock up cash even on chain, and build off of that. I think there's some pretty interesting ideas that could be built. I've heard some people have mentioned even like a gold backed stablecoin, all on chain. So there's one use case.
00:27:38.154 - 00:28:02.900, Speaker A: I'm curious. We have the Q a function, so if anybody has a question, feel free to use that button to submit one. In the meantime, I've got a couple others for you. Diaz, I'm curious you went through the Chainlink proof reserve integration process. We worked very closely together. If you could give some advice to someone integrating chainlink proof of reserve, what would that be?
00:28:04.150 - 00:29:02.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it was quite easy to integrate. There was good documentation, example contracts that was using it. So it was quite straightforward to integrate the proof of reserve system, and you guys were super helpful to get that done. The only thing I would advise people is that there's a lot of ancillary or surrounding infrastructure that might be required. If you want to have your own proof of reserve system, like for example, you need a dashboard to tell you, okay, what's getting locked, what's happening there. If you have multiple vaults, for example, or if you have multiple data points, let's say you're a USDC kind of a system, right? True USD, if you saw that. So you might have a lot of banks, and then those banks have to give you APIs, or you might have different things, right? And you just need to build surrounding infrastructure to make sure that you can support your own system.
00:29:02.406 - 00:29:07.670, Speaker B: So that part is harder. But I think the proof of reserve system integration was quite straightforward.
00:29:08.890 - 00:29:32.942, Speaker A: That's good to hear. We pride ourselves on our documentation, so I'm glad it was straightforward. Maybe while we're waiting for some more user questions just to open it up, I'm curious if you have any predictions on this space in the next three years? Maybe one bold prediction or thought maybe about real world assets or really anything that floors yours. Yes.
00:29:32.996 - 00:30:44.200, Speaker B: So on real world assets, because for us, it's our business model, right. So we need to figure out, and I think one thing that I think would be interesting, you have this confluence of metawers, and then it kind of died down now, but I think with anything, right. I think those things bring in some value, and that value proposition is always there. So I think if you think of something cool that could happen, is that, say, for example, you have this Rolex watch or like an NFT, right? And then imagine that you could collateralize that on Avi and then use the fees from the collateralization to do the maintenance for the watch. So something like this, I think that's pretty much feasible, where a lot of the things that are physical move into the digital realm and you can then use it without having intermediaries and then with these kind of like, proof of reserve systems so you can trust it and use it for collateralization and for different things that power defi or power the crypto system.
00:30:45.210 - 00:31:12.160, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. I think proof of reserve really stands as a trust minimization tool. All these real world assets will, in my opinion, always carry some inherent trust assumptions. But I think what we aim to do is mitigate those and limit those where possible. We have a few questions coming now. One I know you want to get to, it's anonymous that says, does cash plan to develop other vaults in other locations? Are there any new vaults coming?
00:31:15.330 - 00:31:39.186, Speaker B: We have a partner called brings. So brings does have some vaults, and then we want to bring that online. But I think at the same time, we want to get more supply up. So it's kind of like figuring out how to get more B. Two b businesses. So that's like, the walls are easier to do because we have our processes kind of like, defined. Like, the testing tools are defined, the gram gene system with our partner is defined.
00:31:39.186 - 00:31:50.042, Speaker B: So all these things are in place. I think the focus right now is to improve supply before adding more, you know. Happy to talk about it and move on.
00:31:50.096 - 00:31:56.460, Speaker A: Yeah, gotcha. I think you mentioned a new facility, one of the largest coming.
00:31:58.050 - 00:32:17.730, Speaker B: So we do have this in Changi in Singapore. So Singapore is like a friendly jurisdiction, and it has high security. So it's an interesting vault that's coming up. It's called the safe house. The safe house is building like a big vault there with silver. Boom.
00:32:19.430 - 00:32:35.818, Speaker A: Awesome. I've seen pictures. It looks incredible. Noah asks, and this is a clarifying question, is Gramchain the actual custody provider here? In that case, is CGT issuer relying on the services of the custodian for verification, or a bar storage, delivery, et cetera? Can you clarify this?
00:32:35.984 - 00:33:04.900, Speaker B: So Gramchain is basically the software. It's the asset tracking software, whereas cash is the kind of custodian. We're trying to make the UI better, to kind of make sure that's understandable, but, yeah. So cash is the story. And so at the end of the day, the goal belongs to the user. If you have CGT it means you have the underlying goal that backs it.
00:33:05.910 - 00:33:15.080, Speaker A: Gotcha. Interesting question here. Do you anticipate that any governments maybe, or other large institutions would use cash, deposit their reserves in the.
00:33:16.970 - 00:33:47.120, Speaker B: Mean? We'd be happy to get them, but we do KYC on the clients that come in to deposit. But as long as they clear that, I think we don't have any issue and I think it depends on the compliance, if they're okay with it. But if you see do I foresee it looking at the environment globally, I think it could happen. It's likely to happen.
00:33:48.630 - 00:34:13.500, Speaker A: Awesome. Let's see if we have any other questions here we can get to. We answered quite a few already and appreciate everyone who's asked a question. I guess people might want to know where can anyone, I guess, stay up to date with cash? Is there a Twitter website? Where does one stay up to date on all the new developments that you guys have coming up?
00:34:13.950 - 00:34:53.254, Speaker B: So we have the website like cash gold, and we have our Twitter feed as well. So these are where we kind of make the announcements. And the website has a lot of tools to learn and get more details about cash itself and how it works. It's all in there, it's all transparent. We also have the Explorer, which it's on the website, it shows the gold backing, and you can see from the Explorer, it links to you to the chain link proof of reserve as well. So you can kind of get the full picture. So I think the website is like.
00:34:53.292 - 00:35:04.330, Speaker A: The key cash gold. Yeah, got it. Let's see what else we have here. Feel free to submit your questions in the Q a section.
00:35:05.390 - 00:35:19.760, Speaker B: So maybe, Max, while we're waiting for more questions, maybe I can kind of ask you something, because it was kind of nice working with you on the reserve system. And what do you guys have for the future? What other potential use cases are you planning for it?
00:35:21.170 - 00:36:28.126, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think, like you, we see a range of new assets coming on chain, and I think figuring out the best way to bring that reserve data on chain is a priority for us. Proof of reserve really started with working with DeFi protocols through price feeds. And so a lot of the creation of the solution was from them asking, how do we mitigate risk? And I think the future of this product will also be driven by our conversations with these protocols who use these feeds on chain to see what they're looking for. And so I think the future for proof of reserve is largely dependent on both the assets that come online, but also the asks from the DeFi protocols that utilize these feeds to manage their risk. In terms of the think, I think stablecoins, proving reserves for stablecoins is a huge opportunity. We're working with Arminino and trust token on that. I think more real world assets like gold, different financial products, tokenized real estate is very interesting when done correctly.
00:36:28.126 - 00:36:43.450, Speaker A: And then another space I think is right. Opportunity is the carbon credit market. So I think all of these things there's great potential for and proof of reserve can provide value for. So I think that's a little sneak peek of what might be coming next. Right.
00:36:43.520 - 00:36:51.340, Speaker B: So what is your bold prediction for the next three years in the space?
00:36:52.270 - 00:37:46.054, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think we're in an interesting position right now where the space is not heavily controlled or regulated. And so it's a bit on ourselves right now to kind of self regulate and put a lot of these safety mechanisms like proof of reserve in place, but there's no one really demanding that to happen. I think the next year we're going to see more DeFi protocols due to last three to six months, really take on themselves and the initiative to include things like proof of reserve, additional circuit breakers, security checks, just because of recent events. And I think the next year is going to be a great opportunity to set a standard for how this is done. I think we're going to see a lot of trial and error. We already have seen a lot of trial and error, but I think this next year, my bold prediction is we really see this come to be more of a standard. And like the ERC 20 is the standard for tokens on Ethereum.
00:37:46.054 - 00:38:00.980, Speaker A: I think we see a standard for these tokenized off chain assets in terms of how you verify your reserves, how you redeem them, how you mint, how you burn. I really think that's what we have an opportunity to do in the next year, and I think that's going to be the biggest improvement in the space.
00:38:01.430 - 00:38:33.018, Speaker B: I think we shouldn't have any CFI without the proof of reserve system. Right. You even have the implosions that we saw if there was not so much opaqueness into that system. Right. Even other protocols, even things that kind of imploded recently. So if they could use something like this, I think it minimizes trust that's required. Because even protocols that are a lot of things are on chain, there's still some things that off chain, right.
00:38:33.018 - 00:38:52.050, Speaker B: And kind of reduce that. Like some system, if it's integrated, I think it's like a standard. I think I agree with you. I hope to see more of that. Looking forward to seeing more integrations of the proof of reserve systems?
00:38:52.870 - 00:39:10.118, Speaker A: Absolutely. I see we have an audience question to transition back. That would cash be able to provide similar services for assets such as diamonds or commodities? You hinted at this a little bit. Is there a list that you guys have and can you give us any alpha, maybe anything watching?
00:39:10.284 - 00:39:48.866, Speaker B: Sure. So right now the focus is on getting gold out properly and getting that done very well and making it the best that we can. Like as mentioned before, the reserve, which is the new large capacity wall that's been built, they have a lot of silver. Like, they can store up to 15,000 tons of silver. So silver is interesting, especially with the silver to gold ratio. And then of course, other commodities. We're actually interested in doing it like precious metals, precious stones, all these things are something that we can do.
00:39:48.866 - 00:40:18.574, Speaker B: It's just that currently for cash, the focus is on gold. And then the next thing right off this thing is NFDs. Right. And those can be powering people to create those NFDs. So cash wants to be like an infrastructure layer for other B two B's to do. Like if you want to do diamond storage or if you want to do like a Rolex watch storage, we want to be able to create that layer. So that's definitely in the next focus for us.
00:40:18.574 - 00:40:24.286, Speaker B: And besides going multi chain. So these are the two kind of like two pronged approaches that we have going.
00:40:24.388 - 00:40:25.040, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:26.370 - 00:40:28.400, Speaker B: So it's coming, I hope, soon.
00:40:29.190 - 00:40:49.160, Speaker A: Yeah, we're excited. Hopefully we can work with you on proof reserve for those as well. For one more question, Jeff is asking how much gold is in your reserve? I think this may be a good opportunity to pop up the data chain link page to answer this question, see if we can pull that up.
00:40:49.530 - 00:40:50.920, Speaker B: Let's trust the system.
00:40:54.010 - 00:40:56.034, Speaker A: Go ahead. Yeah.
00:40:56.172 - 00:41:28.340, Speaker B: As you can see, we had two months back about 100,000 grams of gold, but now a few redemptions happened and it has gone down to 78, 93 grams of gold. So this is exactly how much grams of gold is there. You can tally this with the explorer to make sure that it's not more or sorry, it's not less. Like completely no clothes. So this is how much is actually there.
00:41:29.990 - 00:41:39.720, Speaker A: Excellent. This is also available on chain, on Etherscan if you want to view it there. But the data chain link tool is a nice visualization for this.
00:41:41.610 - 00:41:56.030, Speaker B: Just to add on. Those are like. So you can see the drop, right? So that drop is basically somebody redeeming their bob. So that drop is like, I think around ten kilos of gold went out of the system or got redeemed by some users.
00:41:58.610 - 00:42:19.346, Speaker A: That's incredible. We're about out of time for today. I do want to ask, we're going to post a survey link here in the chat and if you have thoughts on how this presentation went or items you'd like to see more of in the future out of Chainlink tech talks, please let us know. I want to thank dias. I think what time was it there in Singapore when we started this?
00:42:19.448 - 00:42:27.220, Speaker B: I think it's like 630. Sorry, seven. Yeah, seven. So now it's closing to eight. You can see the sun coming up. Exactly.
00:42:27.750 - 00:42:40.250, Speaker A: Really appreciate your time and I appreciate everyone who joined today had these sectals are a lot of fun. We get to talk with projects like yourself who we think are doing a great job. So thank you for your time and we'll talk to everyone soon.
00:42:40.400 - 00:42:42.440, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks for the time. Thanks, guys.
