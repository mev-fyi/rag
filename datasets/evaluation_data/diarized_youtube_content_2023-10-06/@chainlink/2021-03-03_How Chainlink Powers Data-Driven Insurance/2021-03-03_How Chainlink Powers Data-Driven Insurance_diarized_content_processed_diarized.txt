00:00:01.930 - 00:01:03.950, Speaker A: I see Arbo as basically becoming a platform for any type of data driven insurance growing into that. And we just want to know real, live, existing businesses in each area. And the overall portfolio that comes out of it becomes more and more attractive to later securitize as we grow volumes. And for us, the opportunity set is endless. We just have to execute in each of these industries, and it takes time because we're working with a lot of old school industries. But at the same time, I think the rewards are great from a standpoint of just helping a huge number of people get coverage that just did not have before, and give them some peace of mind as to at least we can cover droughts, we can cover low wind speeds for a wind operator, or we can cover too much rainfall for a port. And so there's a lot of these markets that we are heading into.
00:01:03.950 - 00:01:27.060, Speaker A: And for us, company like Chainlink is going to be an integral part of building these oracles. That what we were discussing before with regards to having data that's objective, clear and secure, using Chainlink to essentially link these different derivatives and insurance contracts as we grow from here.
