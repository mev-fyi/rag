00:00:01.210 - 00:01:01.790, Speaker A: Chain link keepers is fundamentally the ability to give a computation to something called the keeper network, to give a computation that isn't something you can do in a contract or you want to do in a contract. For either capability reasons, the contract can't do it cost reasons. The contract would be too costly, it would be too costly to do in a blockchain, or sometimes privacy reasons. The other reason that we found is realistically, just like you had a centralization problem with data, where people would run their own oracles, and those oracles could fail, and that failure could lead to a DeFi protocol being underwater or dislocated from markets or dislocated from reality. It's very much the same situation with keepers. You have developer teams and developer communities that are building a great DeFi application, a great gaming application, but they don't want to build infrastructure and they don't need to build infrastructure. And that's the problem we need to solve for them at Chainlink.
00:01:02.210 - 00:01:02.606, Speaker UNK: And the.
00:01:02.628 - 00:01:23.570, Speaker A: Chainlink network needs to be built to solve by the larger community, by them together with us, and so on. It's a matter of providing a decentralized system that you can offload the responsibility of off chain computation to, while still having those off chain computations have a measure of decentralization and trust, minimize guarantees.
