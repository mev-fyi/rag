00:00:00.090 - 00:00:29.106, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Thank you so much for joining and tuning in. My name is Tim Kang. I'm the developer and founder of a new platform called multimedia.org. I'm really excited to present to you. And today I hope to show you guys something really cool, something that you haven't seen before. But before that, I'd like to dive into a short presentation to convey a concept around UX crypto.
00:00:29.106 - 00:01:14.862, Speaker A: Ux in its current state is not mainstream ready. I've had friends who are college educated, who are tech savvy, who have tried to just simply mint an NFT and they've just given up because it's out of just frustration and the complexity. And so there's a problem here, but CCIP, thanks to CCIP and account abstraction, things are improving tremendously. So this is the old fashioned way of onboarding a user. I wrote some steps here. You install a wallet. You write down 24 random words, you keep it safe.
00:01:14.862 - 00:01:52.400, Speaker A: You copy the wallet address you get, you download coinbase, you create an account, you verify your id. You make a financial decision on how much you want to purchase or load up. You submit your credit card information. You then send funds from there to the address that you created. And then you finally perform your blockchain action, such as minting an NFT. And then you sign your transaction. So it's very easy now with credit cards, there's a credit card on ramps for example like Moonpay, alchemy pay.
00:01:52.400 - 00:02:20.410, Speaker A: They've made it a bit easier to onboard people and start this process. But you still have to create a wallet. And this is a wallet in the ideal way where we want self custody. And so you still have to create a wallet. If it's a hardware wallet, there's more steps. And then you perform your action. You get requested your credit card information and then you sign your transaction.
00:02:20.410 - 00:03:04.562, Speaker A: So this is what I think is a bit better. It's a solution that's using account abstraction and web authent. So what that means is face ID, touch Id on Android, your fingerprint if you're on a computer, your Pin or passcode. So essentially you create an account using things that people are already familiar with on the platform that people are using. Then you can link an additional device using like a QR code or secure URL. This is to pair multiple devices just in case you lose one device. Then you can start your blockchain action.
00:03:04.562 - 00:03:41.540, Speaker A: You can mint the NFT. You can then submit your credit card information and then sign the transaction using Touch ID or Face ID, for example. And this is something I will demonstrate soon. Actually, this is what I will demonstrate the best, in my opinion. Way to onboard users, it's a three step process. You create the account, you perform your blockchain action, and then you sign. So three steps and people will do what they're familiar with.
00:03:41.540 - 00:04:19.134, Speaker A: All those complications are kind of tucked away. So CCIP has been monumental and instrumental in increasing the UX as well, and also the developer experience. Sergey actually had a talk yesterday and he kind of painted the picture of all the steps it takes to do a cross chain interaction. Mine's a little bit more compressed, but I wrote six steps. You have to go to a bridge, you have to transfer it. You have to decide how much you want to transfer. You sign it, you wait, I missed the step.
00:04:19.134 - 00:04:57.078, Speaker A: You have to switch the networks, then you start your blockchain action and then you sign. CCIAP has reduced this to just a single step. So it's like crucial infrastructure, in my opinion, for people to start participating in a cross chain multichain ecosystem. So this is just like a quick overview comparison. On your left you see around 16 steps, eleven steps if you're using an on ramp. And people have to learn a lot. They need to keep things safe.
00:04:57.078 - 00:05:27.720, Speaker A: They have to write down a sec seed phrase. It's pretty complex. And on your right with CCIP, web authent and account abstraction reduces it to around four steps. And there's nothing new to learn. So in summary, abstraction creates invisibility. We're all for abstraction. We don't want our users to face all the complications that these people that are working towards are trying to build.
00:05:27.720 - 00:06:04.946, Speaker A: The goal should be to tuck that all away. Everyone currently knows that they use the Internet, they use visa, they have credit card information, they know what money is, they know what data is. In the future, I believe that people will just know that they use a blockchain, that they know about account addresses, and then they're using money and data. And that's it. So thank you for listening to my presentation. I'm going to demo. Hopefully it works.
00:06:04.946 - 00:06:25.654, Speaker A: So here I am logging into my platform that I've created. Essentially when you register, it's the same process. You type in the username that you'd like. Oh, the audio is working too. Okay. And then you get a touch id prompt. So that's all it takes to log in.
00:06:25.654 - 00:06:51.200, Speaker A: There's no emails necessary. Of course you can use it as a backup, but all you need is just a device. So this is the platform. It's a creative content platform where people can discover things that people have published. These would be like different art pieces or something. Photos people have minted. This is like an audio section, like for music.
00:06:51.200 - 00:07:30.026, Speaker A: But let's get into the cool part that I was discussing. So this is a little cloud storage system. It's similar to Dropbox, but it's laid out as like a finder window. You can create like folders and whatnot. So let's drag a file in. So this is basically just to manage files on a very web two cloud system. But it takes care of a lot of the web3 components to it.
00:07:30.026 - 00:08:03.606, Speaker A: So I have this thing here that says ensure. I don't know if you can read it, but this is to ensure your asset to be permanent so it automatically will upload and take care of the upload process to rweave, which is a decentralized storage system. And here after it's done. So now if you copy the link, you have it on rweave. So it's very simple. And then you can actually tokenize your assets directly from here. So let's give this a name.
00:08:03.606 - 00:08:45.120, Speaker A: Random shoes meme hello. So I'm confirming it's preparing the data. It's uploading. Wait, what? Okay, sorry, guys. I thought I had it all set up. It. This is embarrassing.
00:08:45.120 - 00:09:16.010, Speaker A: So I'm going to do it again on my developer environment. Everything's, there's still some bugs, but let me do it real quick. What is going on? I'm on the wrong account. I'm so sorry, guys. It. Okay, I'm going to re upload the shoes. It's uploaded.
00:09:16.010 - 00:09:33.442, Speaker A: Should be. I'm going to upload it to. Are we again? Okay. All right, we're back. Random shoes meme hello. So it's going to upload the metadata, essentially. And the asset.
00:09:33.442 - 00:10:23.100, Speaker A: What is going on? Could I get my phone? This might. Thank you. Let's see if this workshop. Technical difficulties. For real now. The QR code isn't scanning. This is insane.
00:10:23.100 - 00:10:57.740, Speaker A: It it. We're going down. I really want to show you guys this. Sorry. Wow. Um, well, I essentially what would happen in the. That's happened, you know, for a year without fail, really.
00:10:57.740 - 00:11:20.436, Speaker A: I mean, of course there's bugs, but face like Touch ID would pop up. I would use my fingerprint and it would mint it. I hope you can believe that it works. Thank you all. Thank you all. But I think it's really cool. I'm very shocked that it's not working right now.
00:11:20.436 - 00:11:43.960, Speaker A: But it works. It's very flawless. You can really just have people participate in the blockchain ecosystem without doing anything different. The security is now on your hardware, on your laptop or your phone. So this is for low value assets. Of course. I'm not encouraging to get rid of hardware wallets.
00:11:43.960 - 00:12:13.030, Speaker A: That's for your high value things. But for onboarding and getting people started, this is, I think, the way to go because it makes it very easy to participate in crypto and blockchain. Say again how? Yes. It is also for developers. So there is more to this platform that I've built. I'm shocked it's not working. It's crazy.
00:12:13.030 - 00:13:04.052, Speaker A: But the platform itself is actually a creative suite. People can come in as a developer and you can dip your feet into creating visuals and real time audio visuals is what I really want to build this for. For example, this is a little chain link animation that I've created, and if I play some music, it should be reacting to the music. I might need to change my device. I think it's working. Yeah. So this is basically a little code sandbox for people to create whatever they would like.
00:13:04.052 - 00:13:53.510, Speaker A: It could be a 3d animation, it could be CSS 2d, but they can come into here, create some kind of artwork, it could be generative art. And then this platform will take care of all of the web, three components where it'll package it up, it'll upload it, bundle it into a URL, which then can be used to mint as like an NFT. So now here, this URL will load this right here. So it's a tool for developers, and I'm really excited to roll this out into a private alpha phase. So if anyone's interested in checking out the broken tech here, please definitely reach out. You can go online on the website and just type in your email. I'll see it.
00:13:53.510 - 00:14:22.568, Speaker A: But dang, I can't believe it didn't work. That's so wild. Yeah. I know why it didn't work. I know why it didn't work. So I was uploading to a different blockchain I was publishing to optimism. I believe this is the problem.
00:14:22.568 - 00:14:39.540, Speaker A: To optimism. And I didn't publish my public keys onto optimism yet. So each chain kind of. You need an account on each chain. So let's try this again. Shoes meme. This is so Mimi.
00:14:39.540 - 00:15:02.380, Speaker A: There we go. Okay. Yay. Thank you. Thank you all. Yeah. So essentially, it is now publishing on chain this token using just touch id.
00:15:02.380 - 00:15:38.754, Speaker A: So if you view it, view your asset, it should load. There it is. This is kind of like opensea or something, where you can see the token, but it is minted on chain using Touch ID. This is kind of the publishing tool that I've created for people to mince things. Cross chain. Basically publish onto my platform. Cross chain.
00:15:38.754 - 00:16:08.110, Speaker A: So you'll see here, like, this asset is on Sepolia. I think this one is on optimism. And it's made my developer experience much easier as well. Because I don't need to index every single blockchain. I don't need to create processes for every blockchain. I have a home chain, a base chain, as Peter CCIP lead would say. I think he would call it your home chain.
00:16:08.110 - 00:16:45.500, Speaker A: And basically everything would publish onto one chain. And then my servers would just index only on one chain. So it's made my developer overhead actually easier. So people, when they publish from any chain that they would like, they choose their chain, it'll go cross chain, and then I'll be indexing from one chain, and those contracts will show from different chains, which is what you see here. Yeah. So that's essentially the platform. This is another cool animation that I made.
00:16:45.500 - 00:17:01.180, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, I think I'm running out of time, but I appreciate everyone. Thank you for bearing with us. My name is Tim Kang. If anyone's interested. I'd love to talk to you guys, but thank you so much.
