00:00:01.770 - 00:00:46.310, Speaker A: Interfaces in solidity look like this. In this example, you want to code some behaviors for hot fudge sauce so you can make the interface look like this. Now, anyone who wants to use your hot fudge sauce understands that they can only get the quantity, increase it, or decrease it. So interfaces are structures in programming languages that define how pieces of software can interact with each other. Just like a panel of buttons in an elevator tell you how to operate the elevator. An interface is a set of method signatures that tell you what you can do with a piece of code. This effectively standardizes how the code can be used, and this standardization reduces development time, cost, and duplication.
00:00:46.310 - 00:00:57.870, Speaker A: Note that interfaces do not include the implementation logic, they just define the interactions possible. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in software development.
