00:00:05.690 - 00:00:22.766, Speaker A: Okay, thanks, everybody, for coming. I see a lot of familiar faces, which is good. I'm Jamie, one of the event managers at Chainlink Labs. Very happy to be joined by my colleagues Sina Foritan, who's director of BD, and our guest Jan Barbarou, the CEO and co founder of Autonomy. And I'll let the two of them.
00:00:22.788 - 00:00:38.818, Speaker B: Take it away if. Thank you, Jamie. All right, everyone, my name is Tina. Good to meet you all. And with me we have Jan. Barbara. So today we're going to be talking about a few different things, but Jan is the CEO and founder of Autonomy.
00:00:38.818 - 00:00:52.918, Speaker B: Autonomy, excuse me. And so today we're going to talk a little bit about. And so let's start there. Jan, tell us about autonomy and how you actually founded it in general. And then maybe if people don't know, give us a little background on parametric insurance and what it.
00:00:53.104 - 00:00:53.840, Speaker C: Sure.
00:00:55.570 - 00:01:16.866, Speaker D: So autonomy is a parametric insurance platform based on smart contract technology. So we're using Ethereum and polygon for automation. So parametric insurance in very simple, you. Let's start with an example. Right, so what do I mean by parametric?
00:01:17.058 - 00:01:18.806, Speaker C: So if you are, let's say, a.
00:01:18.828 - 00:01:39.014, Speaker D: Farmers in the Midwest and you have some sort of sensitivity to rains or any type of climate and weather event, parametric products essentially trigger on a binary event. So let's say if you're protected against certain threshold of rains, precipitations, the parametric.
00:01:39.062 - 00:02:05.702, Speaker C: Insurance is going to be wiring you the claim compensation automatically without asking why. Don't have to adjudicate. You don't have to kind of administer and investigate. So we're bringing that concept into cargo, marine and shipping. So very much like an binary event trigger. And what we're protecting here is shipment delays and cargo interruptions, which is obviously.
00:02:05.756 - 00:02:07.800, Speaker D: Like a pretty hot topic these days.
00:02:09.130 - 00:02:16.178, Speaker C: So just to summarize, our smart contract is essentially connected to chainlink.
00:02:16.354 - 00:02:17.080, Speaker D: Beautiful.
00:02:17.390 - 00:02:40.510, Speaker C: Oracle API service provider. We have direct connectivity with API service from logistics, airport and other providers. We can integrate the off chain data, our own chain data. And the smart contract is doing detection, activation, which is auto identification, and then digital payments to automatic settlement.
00:02:42.050 - 00:02:43.300, Speaker E: Sorry about that.
00:02:44.470 - 00:02:52.782, Speaker C: Thank you. And I mean, that's about it for parametric.
00:02:52.846 - 00:03:08.620, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. And then so what if we actually, how about you give us the steps and breaking down on how to actually take out an insurance policy with autonomy? And then it'd also be pretty helpful if you could walk us through how that compares to like a traditional insurance policy.
00:03:09.150 - 00:04:03.114, Speaker C: That's a good question. I just want to preface the fact that we spend huge amount of time with my engineering team in terms of kind of opening up our infrastructure with API connectivity. So we do provide very simple to onboard, very simple to communicate with in terms of detection of events, auto adjudication, dynamic coding and pricing for clients, but also like digital sentiment. So everything is API connected. And we also kind of blended very effectively into the purchase path of let's say logistics, which is the end client. And we essentially integrate to bolt on widgets or API calls with our brokers partners. And that can be essentially like one click policy purchase and you're done with it.
00:04:03.114 - 00:04:54.090, Speaker C: You don't have to call your insurance providers or try to adjudicate or try to remember what happened. Everything is set and done pretty quickly. And in terms of how we compare, these few metrics are interesting to focus on is we auto adjudicate, so administer claims, insurance claims in 45 minutes instead of 45 days. So that's like a tremendous 100 x improvement for the client standpoint. And by the same token, no pun intended, we also resolve for admin costs 90% compression in terms of the expense that's been involved into adjudicating claims and insurance operations. So this is very much like across the board, across the value chain, added value for both the clients and the insurance partners.
00:04:54.990 - 00:05:10.654, Speaker B: Thank you. I want to double click on something talked about earlier, the air freight insurance that you're doing with Nasdaq. I think it's super interesting. Can we walk through what that is? Maybe what it is, the benefits of it? I think everyone would love to hear a little bit about that.
00:05:10.852 - 00:05:14.340, Speaker C: Sure. So, yeah, we went live last month.
00:05:15.030 - 00:06:25.910, Speaker D: With what we call a cargo index. So we develop this cargo index, we pitch it to Nasdaq. They got very excited and we launched the product onto their platform a few weeks ago. So that was a great event for us, but also a great PR marketing event for us. But beyond it, I wanted to kind of refocus on our core value, right? Core value is automation of operations using smart contract chaining, detection of events, all that jazz, digitized payments and what have you. So this is kind of the core function that we servicing in the industry. But from the grim observation of, let's say, the swiss canal about a year ago, or the ramp up of the supply chain crisis during the holiday about six months ago, it became very clear that the whole underwriting model that we develop internally, which is a proprietary pricing developed by my quant team, became something that a broader audience would be very glad to look at.
00:06:25.980 - 00:06:26.262, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:26.316 - 00:07:04.466, Speaker D: Because you get a sense in terms of numbers in terms of trend, what's going on? So we developed this very unique cargo delay index based on our internal proprietary pricing analytics, and we proposed we pitch it to Nasdaq. And they get excited right away because it was versions of supply chain, Cris, blockchain, insuretech insurance technology. And I kind of rang a bell to them. And you can check it out on our website, autonomy AI. It's one of the pages, but it's very much like the starting point of more things happening in the industry where.
00:07:04.488 - 00:07:06.642, Speaker C: We want to democratize access to data.
00:07:06.776 - 00:07:08.626, Speaker D: And also access to financial products that.
00:07:08.648 - 00:07:10.630, Speaker C: Are based on our insurance contract.
00:07:11.850 - 00:07:33.280, Speaker B: So you actually spoke with some of these traditional folks about these things. Do you think these traditional insurance organizations and these traditional companies understand how parametric insurance and smart contracts work? Or is that a challenge or a barrier? What's it like? Are they accepting? Are they open to it? Or they actually more or less don't even really understand what it is?
00:07:34.050 - 00:07:40.734, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there was a rhetorical question, right. It's pretty hard to kind of explain.
00:07:40.852 - 00:08:03.170, Speaker C: What we mean by parametric insurance. Insurance. They kind of are notorious to actually kind of drag on their feet when it comes to resolving any issues. And therefore we're kind of going 180 degrees by automating pretty much everything in the stack. And the first reaction is, okay, are we going to lose our shirts overnight?
00:08:03.250 - 00:08:04.998, Speaker D: Because your robot is going to be.
00:08:05.004 - 00:08:52.694, Speaker C: Like doing the whole work and we don't even control it. Right. So obviously that's kind of an antiquated approach to the problem. But the reality is parametric insurance has been kind of existing for quite some times in the climate and weather space, as I was explaining for farmers and climate sensitive use case. So there's still like a niche market within insurance where people are kind of understanding this is kind of coming their way. They've been kind of not too happy about the fact that it's coming faster than they think. And you have to pick and choose the early adopters within the dinosaurs, right? So far I'm just picking an example.
00:08:52.694 - 00:09:39.490, Speaker C: I saw some interviews today. I heard from a friend of the founders, actually, they went pitching 60 different banks before they're getting their first partner license. And you always have to go through either fundraising or partnering with corporates to get majority of no's until you find the one that's willing to take the risk with you because they have the right vision. And yeah, that's what happened to us. Right. So we had to convince people we have to go the route of essentially explaining the methodology. But more than that, we had to kind of connect the dots in terms of the numbers, because what they care about is not the clients, what they care about is the performance.
00:09:39.490 - 00:09:47.030, Speaker C: And in order to produce the right performance, you need to have the right underwriting and pricing model on the background.
00:09:47.770 - 00:09:57.260, Speaker B: Super interesting. Any other types of insurance maybe that are interesting to you guys that are not autonomy that maybe some of us aren't even thinking about?
00:09:58.350 - 00:10:53.614, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's a lot of adjacent use cases that we very attentive to. So I mentioned climate and weather, because transportation, global trades, shipping and marine are actually affected by those risk factors, right? So that's part of the quote unquote x risk. That's what keep those insurance up at night. So climate is one thing, but when you think about it, we're going more and more after quality of data, secure data that we can rely on in order to produce those parametric products, which are data driven, fast execution, and very much like binary type of outcome. And in order to secure the data with Chainlink, the encryption is helpful, but you want to also have the right.
00:10:53.652 - 00:10:55.210, Speaker D: Data in the input.
00:10:55.290 - 00:11:16.382, Speaker C: Right. So those tracking devices, smart containers, all those data services, they prone to be hacked, they're prone to cyber threat to some attacks. And as part of our DNA is to essentially think that we could be protecting against some events in the transportation.
00:11:16.526 - 00:11:18.006, Speaker D: But we could be also protecting the.
00:11:18.028 - 00:11:29.186, Speaker C: Ecosystem, which is having a sense to be able to actually expand the product coverage into protecting API services, smart containers.
00:11:29.298 - 00:11:34.170, Speaker D: Iot sensors, tracking devices against cyberattacks and cyber threats.
00:11:35.870 - 00:11:46.000, Speaker B: Thanks for the answer. Kind of a fun question. DeFi was super popular this past year. How do you envision paramedic insurance overlapping with DFI moving forward?
00:11:47.170 - 00:12:55.234, Speaker D: Yeah, it's pretty much my favorite topic. Thanks for asking. Again, kind of going back to the origin story. So 20 years in Wall street, working on a lot of financial derivatives, those pretty well defined financial products that are kind of like based on one single event option market, swap market. My perception is parametric product, which are also very binary, are the adjacent market in the insurance space. So I'm pushing for the creation of a market which is saying parametric insurance are going to become like the next DeFi swap market of Defi financial derivatives. And what's more, the operations, the pricing, what's very salient in this space is there's a huge amount of untapped money that's just sitting on the sideline to be deployed in order to back those product.
00:12:55.234 - 00:13:35.166, Speaker D: And right now, like to give you a sense, the whole market is about $100 billion maybe in terms of crypto is still pretty big. But if you want to look at metrics on the global standpoint, global equities 120,000,000,000,000. Global bonds market is 110,000,000,000,000. Global GDP 80 trillion. And what are you looking at is a crypt market that's one to 2 trillion at that point, plus minus the volatility. So what's going to happen? My belief, I'm sure everybody could be sharing the same type of ideas. We're seeing a 20 x to 50 x growth in the space.
00:13:35.166 - 00:13:45.698, Speaker D: DFI insurance or decentralized insurance is going to be one of those nascent subsector that could be growing quite a bit.
00:13:45.864 - 00:14:10.220, Speaker C: So we betting on the fact that we have very simple product to design, simple product to adjudicate that can be very much automated through a smart contract in order to connect to the risk capital on the other side. So Defi is where it's meeting parametric insurance and they are going to be BFF to my standpoint. Thank you.
00:14:11.470 - 00:14:23.620, Speaker B: Let's say I'm a traditional insurance company and I wanted to incorporate some sort of web three model. Is it possible, do I just say no? Or is this something that's actually feasible and do we want it?
00:14:24.070 - 00:14:41.734, Speaker C: I feel like you have some experience there, so I'm going to kind of return to you at some point. I'll say something. The short answer is the understanding and.
00:14:41.772 - 00:14:45.974, Speaker D: Knowledge is very basic so far, and.
00:14:46.012 - 00:15:20.782, Speaker C: Not like in the wrong way. I'm not trying to point fingers or anything like that. Insurance is like what banks were like 1012 years ago. So you think about banks as being antiquated. So they are like antiquated squared or something to that effect. When you talk about web three, there's no real response either. It's from the smart contract automation standpoint or for, let's say the DFI standpoint, you got to be like 1000 miles from them understanding.
00:15:20.782 - 00:16:17.378, Speaker C: And then other part of web three which is digitized property ownership, right? So NFTs or whatever you want to name it, this is something that doesn't ring a bell to them just now, but everything actually makes a ton of sense for insurance contract because you could be thinking about NFTs being implemented for insurance policies where you get ownership. This is immutable, the whole nine yards. And it's also like a transferable piece of paper, quote unquote, which is not a piece of paper anymore. That makes a ton of sense. Now what's happening is while they're not understanding well what's happening is they're also very intrigued, they're very curious. I have a lot of very interesting questions and I don't doubt that they're going to have to wake up to it. They want to make it happen to a certain extent.
00:16:17.378 - 00:17:17.000, Speaker C: And essentially in the light of the fact that they're actually facing those insurance people like major risks such as climate X risk, pandemic, cyber threats. Unfortunately, the russian crisis is a tragedy. And yet again, this could be like some billions of dollars wasted because people don't know how to adjudicate any claims or protection in that case. And obviously the loss of people there, it's very tragic as well. I'm not saying it's only financial, but then I think what they need to do in this case is really take a risk of running those proof of concept with intratech startup insurance technology startups such as us and grow the portfolio. Right now the portfolio is very small. When you compare fintech and intratech, we talk about at least a ten X level.
00:17:18.810 - 00:17:39.706, Speaker B: Thanks for that. And yeah, so for context, my team works with different crypto native traditional firms, crypto native firms and traditional firms. And so there's a big difference. Crypto native firms live in this space and traditional firms are really just learning about it. And the biggest issue, honestly is there's always interest. People always want to adapt. People know they have to adapt.
00:17:39.706 - 00:18:16.970, Speaker B: There's billions of dollars in innovation arms for a reason, but they move slow and they need folks like autonomy who can step in and at least get things expedited to a certain degree. So it's pretty complimentary, which is really nice to see. At the end of the day, it's a lot of red tape that you have to deal with. But once you get through that and once you can get people like autonomy who know what they're doing and can come in and provide a good white glove solution, then it really helps get things expedited for all of us in the standard retail world. So before we wrap up for a Q and A, any things you want to mention about autonomy that people should know about?
00:18:17.040 - 00:18:18.346, Speaker C: Yeah, so kind of a follow up.
00:18:18.368 - 00:18:25.566, Speaker D: Of what you just mentioned, I think, as you said. So we need people that are kind of in between.
00:18:25.668 - 00:18:26.222, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:26.356 - 00:19:09.862, Speaker D: I've seen the corporate world for two decades, kind of made a leap of faith into this space, which is fascinating, but we also kind of like telling ourselves that we are committing to being the bridge with traditional space and this very vibrant sector, which is blockchain web three DFI. And to that effect, actually, we are working actively into a tokenized insurance model this year. It's a little stealth at that point, but we'll be present. We want to disrupt more than just operation automation. We want to get into the decentralized.
00:19:09.926 - 00:19:11.518, Speaker C: Capital side of things.
00:19:11.684 - 00:19:25.620, Speaker B: Thanks for sharing. That's going to be absolutely game changer and exciting for you guys. So thank you for that. All right, cool. Where's Jamie? Q. A. Anyone has any questions for yon, feel free to throw them up.
00:19:30.230 - 00:20:28.994, Speaker D: Do you see one form of insurance getting way more wrecked than others, like property, life insurance, phone, electronics in web two? Yes, I think catastrophe insurance, what they call cat bond or disaster insurance, it is like major concern. Global warming is not a myth. So it is impacting internationally, globally, and exponentially more severe. The other one is cyber threat. I think we're living through some moment in history now, which is very tragic. But I think it's eye opening in terms of the fact that we need cyber company, cybersecurity company to step up and insurance needs to follow suit. They need to be there to implement.
00:20:29.122 - 00:21:05.264, Speaker C: The right technology to connect. You don't want it to get into a situation where you write, let's say, $10 billion of cyber policies and next thing you know, you don't want to adjudicate, which is a good old story in insurance. So. So why did you choose the MGA model first? You just said that you're transferring to a full. You guys are going to become the insurance company after. Now, is that what I understood or no? Yeah. So I don't know if people are familiar with MGA.
00:21:05.264 - 00:21:21.544, Speaker C: So MGA is managing general agent in the grand scheme of know, you can view an MGA as a program administrator that work with insurance carriers and other distributor in terms of creating new product. Right.
00:21:21.582 - 00:21:23.288, Speaker D: So there's a little bit of product.
00:21:23.374 - 00:22:05.620, Speaker C: Innovation mindset in insurance having those mga model, except that the technology is not there. So we created that business model because we know we can be nimble. We can bring a lot of the insurance innovation and the technology at the same time. We kind of using our own software to write those product and also adjudicate, operate and whatnot and underwrite as well. But yeah, I think you're hinting at the fact that we might actually become full stack, full stack being like not only the underwriter, but also having the balance sheet on the back of it. Something that we're thinking about. It's pretty early for us to kind of speculate.
00:22:05.620 - 00:22:37.120, Speaker C: Lemonade done it. Not comparing myself to lemonade. But it's a good example where actually they grew extremely fast and they became an underwriter and providing the balance sheet as well, real quick. But as a caveat, it's very clear that tech enabled MGA is a new trend. It's very small as a niche market, so it's very interesting to get involved right now because that's going to be very democratized in the next decade.
00:22:38.820 - 00:22:56.268, Speaker F: Do you feel like you're leaving anything on the table with regard to a tokenization component by just starting as an MGA? If you owned your own balance sheet and you could tokenize the balance sheet and rate that as the transfer of risk, is that what you're considering?
00:22:56.464 - 00:23:14.892, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, give or take it is pretty much the plan. Again, I think there's a little bit of catch 22 here where you want to follow the red tape, the traditional model, but then you get yourself into.
00:23:14.946 - 00:23:16.140, Speaker D: A rabbit hole, right.
00:23:16.210 - 00:23:50.504, Speaker C: Because you cannot just get out of it if you've been following too much of the traditional model. So we want to keep a balance of saying we'll be following the red tape as much as we have to to get those MVPs and product in the market and democratize. But we want to have an eye open looking forward on the tokenized capital as well. It's almost like a separate project, but we're connecting the dots in the background and it's a little bit of an evil plan if you think about it, because they're not aware that we're doing.
00:23:50.542 - 00:23:52.632, Speaker D: It, but it could be fine.
00:23:52.686 - 00:23:53.290, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:58.700 - 00:24:23.570, Speaker E: Hi. So I think you alluded to looking to expand into the reinsurance business, like going into these data API issues, data collection, that kind of thing. How are you guys dealing with your own risk regarding data inputs and potential glitches that go into these automated systems? Do you guys have reinsurance? Is it like a Defi reinsurance? Is it traditional reinsurance, or is that just not part of your business model yet?
00:24:25.000 - 00:24:27.300, Speaker D: Yeah, kind of all of the above.
00:24:28.200 - 00:24:31.590, Speaker C: So we actually have a panel of.
00:24:32.280 - 00:24:35.200, Speaker D: What we call treaty insurance reinsurance.
00:24:35.360 - 00:24:39.304, Speaker C: So you can not the swiss re or the big names, they're more like.
00:24:39.342 - 00:24:42.904, Speaker D: Tier two, but that's why they're actually.
00:24:42.942 - 00:24:45.524, Speaker C: More flexible, because they don't have the bureaucracy.
00:24:45.652 - 00:25:18.580, Speaker D: So this is kind of the traditional bucket. We also have an amazing partner in Bermuda called Encuro, and I would recommend that you invite Marco next time. You know the guy? Amazing guy. I met him in Milan, actually in December in person. That was pretty funny. So we have a decentralized reinsurance and we also have the traditional reinsurance, and we do want to be present in both space as long as we can, but the real end game is decentralized.
00:25:22.680 - 00:25:44.590, Speaker G: So what are the limiting factors to you guys and other insurance providers in other sectors, outside of catastrophe or climate or what have you, what are the limiting factors to those sectors of insurance becoming sort of tokenized, put on the blockchain, or integrating smart contracts into how they do their business?
00:25:46.640 - 00:26:18.144, Speaker D: Yeah, simple answer is data. Right? So data quality and data security is the starting point. You just can't develop a parametric product. Garbage in, garbage out, right? So there's definitely like limitation for that perspective. And so the global insurance market is $6 trillion. So I'm not pretending that autonomy is going after $6 trillion worth of TAM.
00:26:18.192 - 00:26:19.930, Speaker C: Right. Total address market.
00:26:20.460 - 00:27:24.396, Speaker D: It's probably like a small section as of now, but it is hundreds of billions anyway. So it's pretty big in the grand scheme of things. Now in the supply chain business, what's also very clear is this kind of like subsequent innovation stack that's pushing very hard. And then you can call it like small containers, right? The iot tracking devices, the mask, CGM, MSc of the world, they're learning the very hard way right now that if they don't have the right infrastructure, the right technology, the right tracking through GPS, computer vision sensors and whatnot, they're not going to survive. I mean, they're making a ton of money because they're just surfing the inflation wave right now. But it's not going to last very long. Relying on the fact that digitization of data on the supply chain, for instance, is actually our best friend.
00:27:24.396 - 00:27:42.336, Speaker D: Because now we are the receiving end, we are the financial insurance partner, can absorb, ingest those data thanks to Chainlink, Oracle, and then creates very novel product insurance products. And I don't doubt like we have the same conversation in five years.
00:27:42.438 - 00:27:44.464, Speaker C: We're going to be very astonished that.
00:27:44.582 - 00:27:48.420, Speaker D: It is not as small as we think. It is progressing very fast.
00:27:48.570 - 00:27:50.084, Speaker G: Could you make the same argument about.
00:27:50.122 - 00:27:53.750, Speaker H: Something like Tesla taking over the world? Let's say that that's actually happening.
00:27:54.200 - 00:27:58.008, Speaker G: The similar amount of sensors and data.
00:27:58.174 - 00:28:00.424, Speaker C: That are coming off your car could.
00:28:00.462 - 00:28:07.080, Speaker G: Verify that there's been an accident, there's been an impact, and that could be the entree for the auto insurance industry.
00:28:08.380 - 00:28:10.604, Speaker C: Yes, I'll briefly talk about it.
00:28:10.642 - 00:28:13.150, Speaker D: I'm not very big in car insurance.
00:28:15.280 - 00:28:31.600, Speaker C: We had reverse inquiry from a big insurance working with a big constructor, I think it was GM, not to name it. And the first use case in parametric that they want you to think about is total car. Right. Because it's kind of like the simple.
00:28:31.670 - 00:28:32.876, Speaker D: Case, everything is destroyed.
00:28:32.908 - 00:28:54.970, Speaker C: So you can say destroyed. Yes. Then you get your money back, as opposed to more of an in between accident where you just broke your. Whatever it is, but Fender banner, so it's less clear if you get your money or not. But you mentioned you have some work. As much as you can share. I don't know.
00:28:55.420 - 00:29:32.084, Speaker B: Yeah, we work with certain consortiums that take inputs from Tesla cars that measure everything. It's not necessarily like the car parts itself. It's more like the weather, the speed of the car, elevation, altitude. We can even pull in like deforestation levels. And these Tesla cars have crazy amounts of data inside of it, so it can be piped into a handful of different things. And so there are consortiums out there in the world that exist that actually consume this data and operate like a PNC type insurance model. Yeah, you don't need a mic.
00:29:32.084 - 00:29:33.348, Speaker B: It's quiet here.
00:29:33.514 - 00:29:55.310, Speaker H: You mentioned earlier that with your technology you're able to kind of really limit the back office expenses and there's a lot of savings there. Would you ever go after industry like personal health insurance, where the demand is so high for an affordable product and even though it might not have. Right. Data inputs now, the demand is so much that if you can even lower the price by a little bit, there will be a lot of people wanting it.
00:29:56.480 - 00:30:34.280, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good use case. Many people have thought about it. Obviously, the problem with medical and health insurance is much more political, fundamentally. So then you get yourself into like a double red tape, so to speak, right. And therefore it's not as easy. Then we discussed it with this gentleman over there, actually like about half hour ago, that there's also some privacy issue. So let's say you want to create a blockchain network for EHS, right, the health records.
00:30:34.280 - 00:31:24.168, Speaker C: Then you get into a point where you cannot just implement it because of the red tape, while the technology can be implemented like in six months, whatever. So the starting point is very hard, steep curve to actually start, get started with it. And then second, I think the magnitude of dollar amount or whatever fiat currency or digital currency you're using to assess the magnitude, it is quite bigger than, let's say, the cargo insurance space, right? So all that kind of indicates that you cannot be just like a small startup and say, I'm going to be disrupting Medicare or whatever it is, right. But at the same time it is coming. Let's have the same conversation five years.
00:31:24.254 - 00:31:26.890, Speaker D: This probably going to be some great use case.
00:31:29.260 - 00:31:29.912, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:30.046 - 00:31:55.040, Speaker I: So what about decentralized credit unions in that space and the risk, like credit risk and hacking, defaulting, just general Defi banking Ave compound, things like that, and the role of insurance and those projects.
00:31:57.140 - 00:32:00.630, Speaker C: So are you referring to a credit insurance?
00:32:01.240 - 00:32:04.180, Speaker I: Yeah, like decentralized credit, yeah.
00:32:04.330 - 00:32:12.024, Speaker C: So there's other projects that are implementing mutualized insurance, which is pretty much what you think.
00:32:12.062 - 00:32:13.690, Speaker D: Are you alluding to?
00:32:14.780 - 00:32:19.288, Speaker C: I don't think we're going that route specifically because we're not too much of.
00:32:19.294 - 00:32:23.020, Speaker D: A B to C or B two B to C. We're more of a B two B.
00:32:23.170 - 00:32:27.436, Speaker C: So the capital sourcing in our case is still going to be institutions for.
00:32:27.458 - 00:32:34.136, Speaker D: The most part, and then like crypto LPs. So now there's a little bit of.
00:32:34.178 - 00:32:36.576, Speaker C: Market dynamic when you want to make.
00:32:36.598 - 00:32:42.080, Speaker D: Sure that your algorithm is going to be robust enough so that you can have enough capital and fund in order.
00:32:42.150 - 00:32:51.732, Speaker C: To back the insurance policies on the back end. Right. So this is kind of generalized concept of credit risk or counterparty risk. So this is correct.
00:32:51.786 - 00:33:11.308, Speaker D: That's part of the equation. Now, we're not there yet, and I think there's already some protocol that are doing a pretty good job at mitigating counterparty risk. So I think we'll be inspired by what's existing because this is not the core business that we're going after. We're more like underwriting insurance assets as.
00:33:11.314 - 00:33:12.430, Speaker C: Opposed to the credit.
00:33:12.880 - 00:33:14.350, Speaker D: But it's a good question.
00:33:16.880 - 00:33:38.816, Speaker F: How do you value the chain link, Oracle? You could tap into these data feeds yourself, right? But you use the oracle to make an independent validation. But you could yourself, you could manage the node, right? I'm not trying to understand the total value of it. I love chainlink, as they call them. But what's the real value of the chainlink?
00:33:38.848 - 00:34:16.656, Speaker D: Oracle wouldn't be interesting that you said you hate chainlink. Well, by the way, I hate Chainlink. The key item here, the key principle is parametric insurance, right? In this case they only legit if we can get independent, autonomous generation of truth, right? And I think that's one of the core function of chainlink in general. Like being like this more oracle means something, right? So this is like it provides the.
00:34:16.678 - 00:34:20.770, Speaker C: Truth that you don't have to subjectively decide for yourself.
00:34:21.140 - 00:34:45.816, Speaker D: And because that's the starting point of our business, we believe that Chainlink is actually a key component. Now what you're saying is also true in the fact that we're not going to be able to actually decentralize every key items of the data consumptions. Right, or the data event trigger. There's going to be some cases where we could have private API and for.
00:34:45.998 - 00:34:47.496, Speaker C: Let'S say a proof of concept of.
00:34:47.518 - 00:35:14.390, Speaker D: Six, nine months, and then we move on to kind of integrating chaining for new adapters, that kind of stuff. But we're trying to get as decentralized, as independent as much as possible, because the principle itself, first principle, having an independent event trigger decision making is very important. And Chenik also like best in class in terms of encryption and security of the data.
00:35:17.560 - 00:35:53.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if he was just single sourcing from a single point of feed or single point of failure, he is now dependent on that single source. Exactly. So we take certain data feeds, we build adapters with it, we have very strict requirements on what those APIs can be, how often they update. We decentralize it by putting with other node operators. And now he's got a decentralized data feed that has no central point, it's got a multi tier aggregation layer to it, and he's always getting the most quality answer at every given time. So that's kind of why autonomy wouldn't.
00:35:53.788 - 00:36:02.370, Speaker F: Run their own node for cargo data. It would be parcel out. Chain link kind of helps that distribution process or management process.
00:36:03.060 - 00:36:12.530, Speaker B: Exactly. Anyone else? All right, everyone, let's give it for Jan. Thanks so much.
00:36:17.260 - 00:36:22.390, Speaker A: Feel free to stick around. We have more food, more drinks. Jan will be around, Cena be around. Thank you.
