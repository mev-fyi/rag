And at declimate our skill set is about the climate data, about the different user bases, and understanding how a marketplace can be built. We didn't want to get into building or post, because Chainlink is already the expert at that. Right. We're not trying to reinvent the wheel. So I think Chainlink forms a very important base layer for us, and then we'll be unique in the sense that we'll also be using Chainlink for the governance layer. So a lot of the, on the sort of day to day side, the DAO's job will be to select different Chainlink nodes as validators.
00:00:47.970 - 00:00:55.900, Speaker A: And so Chainlink sort of starts from the base layer, but it really goes all the way up to the dial in terms of our operations. So.
