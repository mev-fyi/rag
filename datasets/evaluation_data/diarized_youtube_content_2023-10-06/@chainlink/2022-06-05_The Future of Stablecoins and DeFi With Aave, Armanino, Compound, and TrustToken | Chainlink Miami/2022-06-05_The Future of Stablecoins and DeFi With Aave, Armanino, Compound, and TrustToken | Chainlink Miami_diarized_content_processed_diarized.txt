00:00:23.290 - 00:00:43.334, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody. We're about to start the panel. Got some great guests with me today. Today is going to be about the potential in DeFi and we'll just jump right into it. So we're going to go down the line, starting with you, Raphael. You state your name, what company you're currently working on, and everyone always starts the panel. How do you get into crypto? But we're going to change it up.
00:00:43.334 - 00:00:45.778, Speaker A: What do you think the end game is for Defi?
00:00:45.874 - 00:00:49.982, Speaker B: Oh, endgame for Defi. Okay, well, wait, you got to introduce yourself first. Hang on.
00:00:50.076 - 00:00:51.326, Speaker A: Okay, sorry about that.
00:00:51.348 - 00:00:52.122, Speaker C: I'm Mike.
00:00:52.186 - 00:00:55.310, Speaker A: Mike Zaharsky. I'm with the chain McLabs business development team.
00:00:55.460 - 00:01:05.962, Speaker B: All right, Mike is the man. Thank you. All right. Hello, folks, I'm Raphael. Good to see you all. Thank you for coming out. I am the co founder and CEO of Trust Token.
00:01:05.962 - 00:01:10.834, Speaker B: Can I get a show of hands? Who's heard of trust token? Great, a lot of folks have heard of it.
00:01:10.872 - 00:01:11.074, Speaker C: Okay.
00:01:11.112 - 00:01:51.278, Speaker B: We are the makers of true USD, which is a billion dollar fiat backed stablecoin, as well as true Phi, which is a protocol for uncollateralized lending on the blockchain, have originated $1.6 billion of uncollateralized loans on the Ethereum blockchain in the last 18 months and hoping to grow that from there. So that's me. Oh, wait, what's the end game for DFI? That's the question. I think the end game for DFI is having the majority, or at some point the overwhelming majority of all of finance running on our rails. So I see this as actually early days for DFI. I think we're still sub 1% and we have several orders of magnitude growth to go.
00:01:51.278 - 00:01:58.450, Speaker B: So if any of you are not in DFI, I really think it is the most exciting part of all of crypto and would highly recommend you to get involved.
00:01:59.750 - 00:02:22.790, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, I'm Getty. I am with GFX Labs, a research and development organization in crypto. You guys probably might know me from a compound and doing a lot of compound governance. Hopefully I'll definitely be repping a lot of that tonight as I'm up here as the compound guy, but I'm just a community member. They don't actually work for the team, but I do get paid by the protocol, so that's decent as well. But yeah, I'll be repping compound.
00:02:22.950 - 00:02:24.730, Speaker A: What's the end game for DFI?
00:02:25.230 - 00:02:36.174, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the end game is like when the banks agree that these tools are better than traditional markets and traditional tools. So once we see them plugged in with uniswap v three, that's when we've won.
00:02:36.372 - 00:02:36.830, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:02:36.900 - 00:02:42.320, Speaker B: And can I ask, can people in the back hear us? Okay, can I get a thumbs up? All right, great. Okay.
00:02:42.930 - 00:03:03.640, Speaker D: Hey, everybody. Clayton Lowry. I'm a senior manager at Arminino. We are one of the top accounting and consulting firms in crypto. We've been doing it a long time back since 2014. One of the oldest and most experienced in this space. And I've had the privilege of working with true USD for a long time on a lot of their awesome transparency stuff.
00:03:03.640 - 00:03:29.870, Speaker D: Endgame for Defi. I really believe in the tokenization of everything theory that everything of value, that off chain assets is coming on chain and some representation of it. I think we are probably headed towards some sort of bifurcation of like a permissioned. Ok, kind of defi and a little more wild west one. Longer term, I don't know if I want that to happen, but I think that's kind of where we're headed.
00:03:31.010 - 00:04:02.620, Speaker E: All right, what's going on, everybody? My name is Stephen Valeri. I am a smart contract dev at Aave Ave is one of the largest decentralized liquidity protocols. So you can deposit your crypto and earn interest on it, and you can also use that crypto as collateral to then borrow against. What do I see as the end game for Defi? I think that DeFi has the potential to be the underlying infrastructure of the global financial economy. So I agree that we are early.
00:04:03.230 - 00:04:17.230, Speaker A: I think we're with a bunch of like minded individuals here. So first question, I'm going to launch your way. Ralph, what got you interested in tokenized assets, more specifically stablecoins? And how did that lead you to found Truepie and to USD?
00:04:17.650 - 00:04:52.410, Speaker B: Absolutely. So we got interested in tokenized assets and stablecoins back in 2017 when the only stablecoin on the market was tether. And my team and I looked at that and we said, okay, this is crazy. These folks have proven out that there is a giant and growing demand for fiat Max stablecoins, but they've really left the door open to competition because of the way that they've run their business and their stablecoin. So we said there's got to be a better way to do this where we actually are working with banks doing things in a regulatory compliant way, building a stablecoin the right way, and that's why we launched true USD.
00:04:52.990 - 00:05:10.810, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. So I do have a follow up question for you. Stablecoins and how they're collateralized have been a very hot topic as of late. Maybe you could share your thoughts on the current industry standards. And it might be a good time to tell everybody what we've been working on between Chainlink to USD and Armanino.
00:05:10.970 - 00:05:46.406, Speaker B: Absolutely. Okay, so we do have a bit of an announcement tonight. Very interesting upgrade to a major billion dollar stablecoin. That is something that is truly an industry first, so please pay attention. We decided this event would be the right time to announce it. I want to say the timing of this is pretty insanely lucky because this is something that we've been working on with Chainlink and with the folks at Armanino for about 18 months now. And the fact that we have the UST situation just a week ago and then we have this event where we're announcing it is pretty wild.
00:05:46.518 - 00:05:49.962, Speaker A: It's pure coincidence, I can promise you. We've been working on this for a very long time.
00:05:50.016 - 00:06:39.190, Speaker B: It wasn't me that shorted UsT and blew it up, I promise. But it does put some wind in our sales. So basically we have a product that we've developed together called proof of reserve, where we have a top us accounting firm, Armanino, auditing the banking partners that have the funds backing true USD in real time twenty four seven. And we actually host a website together where you can see the report from that audit in real time twenty four seven, all the funds that are backing true USD. So that was stage one. Stage two, we worked with Chainlink and we actually put that on chain so you can see through a chain link feed all the funds that back the stablecoin. And that means that even protocols like Ave or compound can actually react and know that those stablecoins are fully backed.
00:06:39.190 - 00:09:15.114, Speaker B: Stage three is what we're announcing tonight, which is a new feature that we're for now calling mint lock. Mint lock is basically an integration of this whole proof of reserve system directly into the true USD smart contract, such that the smart contract literally cannot mint any additional stablecoin unless it is already attested through the third party auditor, through the Oracle network in Chainlink and put on chain, unless it's already attested by those third parties that the US dollars backing those stablecoin are already in the bank. So this makes true USD the first and only stable coin to ever have real protection against an infinite mint attack, which is what protocols like Avan, compound and many others are always concerned about, that a stable coin, it inherently has some points of centralization that there's somebody who can mint it, right? And part of Defi, part of crypto is about having those checks and balances, about decentralizing a system and making it more transparent, more trustworthy. So from day one, when we launched true USD and we saw tether was not doing things in the right way, we said, okay, so we're going to have to have points of centralization because it's a fiat backed stablecoin, but how can we go above and beyond what anyone has imagined to really minimize those and build it in a trustworthy way? So now, today, with this product, even if you compromised all of the keys that control the minting of true USD, which are inherently somewhat centralized, even if you compromise all those keys, which of course has never happened, even then, you would only be able to mint as many true USD as there are dollars in the bank account, unless you also compromise the decentralized oracle network that Chainlink has in the background, that are actually attesting to those values on chain. So it makes any sort of attack much harder, makes an infinite mint attack much harder, and it provides a lot more confidence to people that really care about decentralization and transparency, that when they use a fiat backed stablecoin that has proof of reserve, that has a mint lock, that they know that they are using something that they can trust. That's what we're excited to announce. We think it's a big step forward for true USD, for the stablecoin industry.
00:09:15.114 - 00:09:47.560, Speaker B: And we think it comes at a perfect time when there is more scrutiny than ever on our industry, by regulators, by media, by banks, everyone deciding, thinking through, is this an industry that we can really trust? Is it just full of hype that's going to crash tomorrow? Or are these folks building real high quality products that are going to withstand the test of time? And our response to that is, yes, there is a right way to build these products. We can do it well. We can build things that are going to really be trustworthy, protect users, protect protocols, and push the whole industry forward.
00:09:52.590 - 00:10:08.480, Speaker A: We're very excited about it, too. So I'm going to put the next question to you, Clayton. You've been very involved with this. Maybe you can go in a little bit. What's in his role in being the auditor of this transparency? And specifically, how does poof reserve work? And what role does chain link play in this all coming together?
00:10:09.250 - 00:10:54.394, Speaker D: Yeah, so Raf and his team should get a lot of credit for really driving transparency forward in this industry. I mean, when y'all started, there wasn't, like you said, it was tether and they weren't doing anything. It's been a process from the manual monthly ones up to automating a dashboard where it was just showing the balances and then us layering on the attest and going through the standards on top of that. And now we're here at the on chain aspect, which I think is incredible. I think it's the future of tokenized assets. I think in like five or ten years, this kind of panel is going to be very famous because of what we've pioneered here. What we're basically doing is you all issue on like four or five chains.
00:10:54.394 - 00:11:27.042, Speaker D: We're running nodes on each of those chains and we're querying the balance from each smart contract on that. And then we're checking that every 30 seconds against the balances in each trust and bank account and verifying that those are backed. And then we have an API that we've exposed to a chain link oracle network and there's 16 of us on that network. We are also one of the oracles, but 15 other ones. And we're putting that on chain at a regular interval. And any deviation of mint or redemption. And like you said, every time you are going to have to want to mint, you're going to have to query our feed.
00:11:27.042 - 00:11:42.090, Speaker D: I look at it as like the ultimate control for anyone that's ever worked in risk. This is something that doesn't exist in traditional finance at all. And I think once these regulators understand what you can do with this, it's going to be a big leap forward for our industry.
00:11:43.310 - 00:11:46.046, Speaker A: All right, thank you, Clayton. So this next one, I will say.
00:11:46.068 - 00:11:55.310, Speaker B: Clayton, and you're doing this not just with fiat backed stablecoins like true USD, but with other products, other tokenized assets on the blockchain as well. Can you say a little bit about that?
00:11:55.380 - 00:12:16.390, Speaker D: Yeah, we're doing it with a bunch of carbon credits, equities that are coming on chain. We work with coin shares. They're one of the largest asset managers in Europe. So verifying that their securities are trading, they're actually backed. We have a huge problem. And anyone that trades gold knows that paper gold is maybe not really backed like they claim. And so it even bleeds into that world.
00:12:16.390 - 00:12:27.530, Speaker D: We've got that problem in gold and everyone knows banks are not reserved. So I think what we're doing is awesome because we're building a new financial system that's actually more transparent and trustworthy and it's a great thing.
00:12:27.680 - 00:13:08.450, Speaker B: Exactly. So for those of you who don't know Armanino, they are a phenomenal auditing firm, you should totally talk with them. They're exactly the kind of auditing firm that we need that can really push this industry forward, because they, of course, maintain absolute top auditing best practices, but also are tremendously innovative. They really get blockchain, they really get DeFi, and they're looking to partner with all kinds of companies that want to take trust to the next level. So it's been an absolute pleasure to partner with them on this product. And please, if you've got a product that could incorporate something like that, definitely consider working with them. Just always got a shill on Armanino.
00:13:08.610 - 00:13:23.850, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so this next one's for both you, Steven and Getty. What's the value of a transparent backed asset for somebody like Ave or compound? How do you guys decide what to list as collateral? And how do you decide the LTV for those assets?
00:13:24.510 - 00:14:01.878, Speaker C: Yeah, so a compound, when we talk about listing new assets, and obviously, much like Aave, our whole business model is assets come into the protocol. User can earn interest on them or you can borrow against them. And so when it comes to borrowing against them, we really need to know that whatever we're lending in there, whatever post as collateral has the assets there. One of the classic things, especially for centralized stablecoins, is this infinite risk. And that's been a real thing. So for folks who actually know their compound history well, we've actually never listed a stable coin on the protocol. USDC and Dai, which are the main things of the protocol, got grandfathered in, and tether is on there, QSD is on there, but none of them are actually with collateral factors.
00:14:01.878 - 00:14:12.022, Speaker C: So knowing what's actually behind an asset is really key and really the most critical thing to knowing whether or not we can support a thing as a collateralized asset on the platform.
00:14:12.176 - 00:14:20.080, Speaker B: And Getty, could you go into that just a little bit more? Why is the infinite mint attack so important for protocols like compound to think about?
00:14:20.450 - 00:14:56.940, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So what happens in an infinite attack is, let's say the keys were compromised, extremely unlikely as is. But if they were, that person can mint a bunch of extra tokens into the supply, deposit them onto compound, and then withdraw eth or whatever other assets are on the platform. So all of a sudden, what the platform was supposed to be doing, borrowing, lending, and making sure that collateral was good. This just became a really fast way to drain the whole protocol of all its funds. And so we don't have the same mechanics like Makerdao does, that where you have a debt ceiling, where we can control those things we need to know whatever supported, we could support the entirety of that supply on the platform.
00:14:57.550 - 00:15:07.662, Speaker B: So without debt ceilings, a single asset, if someone could mint it and deposit it into the protocol, they could clean out literally the entire protocol, every single penny that's in there.
00:15:07.716 - 00:15:29.506, Speaker C: Exactly. And that's why stuff like Dai makes a lot of sense to the protocol. We know what's behind Dai. We can audit that. We can see what exists there. You can't do the same for USDC tether to USD today, at least until now we can, and I think there will be a very bright future for this. I think a lot of folks are going to find this a really important thing, especially after last week's events.
00:15:29.538 - 00:15:32.322, Speaker A: Now, Stephen, you want to give your approach.
00:15:32.466 - 00:16:13.918, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure. When you're looking to list an asset as collateral, there's a lot of things that you want to consider. You want to have certain levels of volume, understand the volatility of the asset. You can run a ton of simulations to understand under different market conditions, what type of market configurations might make sense. But outside of just that numerical assessment, you can kind of take a step back and understand what are the major risks of this asset that you're adding. And if we take a look at the stablecoins, for instance, there's a broad range of stablecoins, as we all learned this week, and some of those are one to one asset backed by the US dollar. And the risk there are your centralized entity.
00:16:13.918 - 00:17:07.022, Speaker E: So if that centralized entity isn't behaving as you expect, which as we see with this solution, it's kind of changing that risk and making it and mitigating that risk to a pretty significant extent, then you have your kind of collateral backed stable coins, and that risk is that the collateral totally crashes. Right. And that's a totally different risk than the centralized entity not performing as expected. And then you have other types of stable coins that maybe don't get listed as collateral because they are very high risk. So I think those are some ways of thinking about it as well. Where you want to plot out kind of the attack vectors and worst case scenario for these stablecoins is probably the most important thing you need to understand, because in a good market, it's easy to be a stable coin. In a bad market, that's when you want to make sure the stablecoin is stable.
00:17:07.166 - 00:17:23.798, Speaker B: And Stephen Aave has an interesting model where instead of just having a single market, they have multiple markets, so they can kind of segregate risk between those markets. Could you talk a little bit about that and how that affects when you're thinking about listing potentially different kinds of stablecoins or other assets.
00:17:23.894 - 00:18:00.114, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. So we are deployed across a bunch of different protocols. So we are on Ethereum, we are on avalanche, polygon, arbitram, optimism, phantom and harmony. And all of those markets have different configurations. And based on the market, how many assets are on that, what is the volatility on that chain? You may have different configurations there. In addition to that, with our v three version, we've introduced a lot of risk assessment and risk management features. So we do have some things like supply caps.
00:18:00.114 - 00:18:20.700, Speaker E: We do have an isolation mode where you can limit the exposure the protocol has to a certain asset that's being used as collateral. So I think we're kind of growing in risk management, both on the solution that you're providing and then also in how we're building these markets to have more granular risk management control.
00:18:21.710 - 00:18:28.234, Speaker B: And question for you, Getty, so are other protocols like compound thinking about adding some of these same risk management tools?
00:18:28.362 - 00:18:57.510, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think it is a problem that infamite in general, the fact that a user can supply this, or even more generally, if we're looking at more esoteric assets along the way, if you have an infinite amount, if you could take that whole supply, that's still a problem. If there's a big token holder of a single token, even if they're not minting new tokens, that can still be very problematic. So a lot of those features that Aave has, that makerdao has had are definitely ones that we're considering implementing, but it's a big infrastructure upgrade.
00:18:59.770 - 00:19:08.710, Speaker A: All right, so Roth, I'm going to bring it back to you. What value do you see in algorithmic versus asset backed stablecoins without being overly biased to USD?
00:19:08.870 - 00:19:25.290, Speaker B: Oh, well, man, this is a little different coming a little different this week than after we planned this. I think that there's a whole range of different so called stablecoins. I think that as an industry, we may need to move beyond calling them all stablecoins.
00:19:25.370 - 00:19:25.758, Speaker A: Agree.
00:19:25.844 - 00:20:01.770, Speaker B: Be helpful if we started calling them a couple of different names. Some of them are more like bonds. I do think that some of the so called stablecoins that carry more risk really should have upside associated with them. If any sort of reasonable investor is going to want to hold that stablecoin and take that risk, they should be making something on the upside. So I think that differentiating these into many different products, as opposed to lumping them all as stablecoins, even though they're so different under the hood. Would really help. And actually, speaking of this, we just had a really interesting meeting just yesterday with SMP.
00:20:01.770 - 00:20:21.714, Speaker B: Has anyone heard of SMP? Like SMP 500 ratings agency. So they rate bonds and they are super interested in this space. They were telling me like, yo, we totally get the potential of DFI. We're all over this. Our CEO is on board. He's excited about this. We don't think that the big banks understand how important this is.
00:20:21.714 - 00:20:37.080, Speaker B: They kind of get it, but they don't really get it. And we think that folks like us have a lot of value to add here. So I would love to see us partnering with companies like that to come in and actually start doing more thorough vetting of some of these crypto products.
00:20:37.530 - 00:20:52.700, Speaker C: I feel like I got to hop in there and say, compound just became the first DeFi platform to get an S P rating of a b minus, which is a really big deal. So very exciting news that came out just, I think last week right before all the UST stuff. So very timing as well.
00:20:53.710 - 00:21:22.214, Speaker E: And I just want to hop in too. I totally agree. I think we need better nomenclature for this stuff. I think that it's putting our entire ecosystem at risk. It becomes easy to say stablecoins are a problem when something like this happens because everything's being called a stablecoin when in reality that's not true. And like you talked about earlier, the risk profiles are so totally different. So maybe that's a project for someone out here to come up with some better naming for these products that we have.
00:21:22.332 - 00:21:49.280, Speaker B: Right at the end of the day, if we as an industry, as a team can all do well at educating the world about what we're doing and what these different products are and what their risks are, this whole thing is going to go easier for all of us because we're going to get that scrutiny from regulators, from all kinds of other folks. And it's really on us to be that beacon that helps people to understand what's really going on.
00:21:50.130 - 00:22:11.958, Speaker A: Thank you for that. Steve, let's start with you, but I'd love to get your thoughts on this as well. We've had more dollars lost in exploits in 2022 than we've had in all 2021. What are your protocols, approaches to things like contract exploits, phishing? What type of things are you implementing to guard against those?
00:22:12.044 - 00:22:15.154, Speaker B: We're talking about all the fun stuff tonight. Your favorite topics.
00:22:15.282 - 00:22:30.682, Speaker C: I mean, it's after the conference, right? This is when we got to bring out everything. Compound's model has always been like, slow and steady will win the race here. We're not doing anything fast over in here. And that is a feature. Okay, like governance takes seven days. That's a good thing. Not a whole lot changes.
00:22:30.682 - 00:22:58.334, Speaker C: The protocol for the most part runs itself, which is real testament to decentralization. And just a protocol on chain itself. Like everyone loves uniswap because it just works, right. The fact that compound can just work and that, you know, how it's going to operate for the future is really important. So the biggest thing you can do when it comes to safety in these things is not changing things that work. So if it ain't break, don't fix it. But at the same time, when things do break and there's better ways to do it, there's better tooling to implement.
00:22:58.334 - 00:23:08.360, Speaker C: As Ave's done, we should definitely be looking to do more of that. So there is constant maintenance that's also required with these things and we're always looking to implement that.
00:23:08.890 - 00:24:03.158, Speaker E: Yeah, and I guess as a developer, my initial thought is just around the development process, making sure that you're doing development appropriately, internally, internally reviewing, making sure you're getting external audits. At the end of the day, you can never entirely mitigate contract risk that's going to be there. So that's kind of one aspect of it. And then the other aspect of it is to some extent embracing risk and having the ability to have control over that risk and how you're exposing the protocol. And kind of what I'm trying to say by that is for Ave, I think one of the hopes is with our new version is we can start onboarding assets that previously we would have thought were too risky. And that's not to say that we want to add a new asset and have 80% LTV and totally expose the protocol. It's saying, let's add this asset.
00:24:03.158 - 00:24:53.450, Speaker E: We'll give it maybe no collateral ability or a little collateral ability, and we'll limit the total exposure to the market. And that's what we can do through our new feature called isolation mode. So you can say we're adding this new asset token a and you can only borrow stablecoins against it. And the protocol as a whole is limited that asset to have like $50 million worth of borrowed stablecoins against this specific asset. So things like that, things like supply cap start enabling things to say like, yeah, there is risk here and we're aware of that risk, but people want to take risk, people want to potentially benefit from that. So it's really a balance between managing that risk and trying to mitigate.
00:24:54.030 - 00:25:32.950, Speaker B: Know Getty and Stephen, I want to say I respect compound and Ave both a ton. And I think it's been really interesting to see the different approaches that your communities have taken. Compound going pretty slower on the development side, but really treating that as a feature, not a bug. Some of the best stuff in crypto doesn't change all that fast. And that can make you a real institution and then ave moving a little faster in some ways, which could introduce some risk, but still being really thoughtful about how you're managing that risk and making sure that you're getting value for any additional risk that you or your users are taking.
00:25:33.100 - 00:26:04.880, Speaker E: Yeah, and obviously smart contract development comes with risk. So again, we try to hit that development process appropriately. I think we had five or more audits on v three. And as we launched it again, we had certain supply caps in place. We initially had the multisig as governance control. So again, rather than going, okay, here's v three, it's in the market and do whatever you want, it's more, here's v three. There is risk here and we're going to do kind of a staged approach in releasing this.
00:26:04.880 - 00:26:11.522, Speaker E: Yeah, that's kind of the approach we took. So yeah, there's going to be risk and try to mitigate, manage and control it.
00:26:11.656 - 00:26:43.166, Speaker D: I think a lot of this is on us as an industry, too. Both of you all are awesome, but we have some other people that are much more renegade and we as an industry need to demand transparency, wherever that is. The wormhole hack was a good example. I don't know how many days it went on, but it was already unvacked and no one was even really paying attention to it. And I think everybody here, all of us up here, need to just demand that and push this forward. I think it's really important.
00:26:43.348 - 00:27:06.740, Speaker B: That's right. Even when we're taking risks and even when we're building something that's going to create risk for our users, being transparent about that, being thoughtful about that, giving people time to react, making sure that you'll know what they're getting into, because that's when protocols and products can really get in trouble, is when they're not transparent about those risks, people lose money and they say WTF was going on.
00:27:07.430 - 00:27:14.614, Speaker E: Yeah. And maybe to pull it, know those risks. And there's the kind of the downside. There's also the positive side of where we could end up.
00:27:14.652 - 00:27:14.854, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:14.892 - 00:27:48.686, Speaker E: Like traditional firms doing quarterly reports on what their assets are. No, we can be doing live audits in traditional finance, I feel like that gets thrown around. They're like, we can do live audits, and very rarely do you actually see that. And blockchain gives you exactly that. So there's like the downside where you get bad actors and you have people performing risky things, but there's also the potential great upside where we have better audited processes than you can possibly do today. So kind of a wide array of outcomes.
00:27:48.798 - 00:28:14.438, Speaker C: I think that's exactly it. We got to give people the tools to actually go out there and look into these protocols and how they work. And I'm just a guy who really enjoyed using compound, used it a lot at a trading firm, then got involved in it through governance. And I just read through the code and learned how the system worked. I don't have any inherent connections to anyone or anything, but it's all on the chain. And if you just keep reading through it all, you can figure out how the whole thing works. It isn't that complicated in that sense right there.
00:28:14.438 - 00:28:22.750, Speaker C: People have the whole ability to go look at these systems. You cannot possibly try to do that with any traditional fintech product. And that right there is like the coolest difference to me with all this.
00:28:22.900 - 00:28:46.638, Speaker B: Exactly. I think it's important to remember, just like what we're up against as an industry. It's quarterly reports, annual audits, stuff that's super not transparent, where users are actually getting screwed on a daily basis. I like to does. Where do folks bank? Does anyone here bank with Wells Fargo? I'm a Wells Fargo fan. Okay. I hear booze.
00:28:46.638 - 00:29:10.602, Speaker B: Okay, so why are folks booing? Well, look, I'll just say, look, wells Fargo, it's a totally normal bank. They're not like a fly by wire shop. This is normal Us bank. But in my savings account, I earn, what, like 0.1% on my money? You earn almost nothing. And is it because those guys are lending at 0.1%? I don't think so.
00:29:10.602 - 00:29:23.162, Speaker B: They're not lending at point. I've never gotten a loan from that. .1% I can promise you that. They're lending it a lot more than that. Is there any transparency for me about what they're lending at? No. They're not passing the money back to the users.
00:29:23.162 - 00:29:45.506, Speaker B: I know someone's pocketing that money. It's just not me. There's no transparency about it. I, as a user, am getting a tiny fraction of what's actually being produced. And you compare that to something like compound, something like Ave. It's completely transparent. You can literally see every single loan, the compound or ave protocol has ever made since inception, and the exact terms of those loans.
00:29:45.506 - 00:30:17.170, Speaker B: And so it's a world of difference. You just imagine if a regulator went to Wells Fargo and said, hey, we want you to publish publicly, in real time, 24/7 every single loan that you've ever made, and in real time, you're going to publish all of it. It's crazy. It's a crazy level of transparent. And then if they said, hey, we want you to give 80 or 90% of your returns back to users, whereas now I'm getting a tiny fraction, it's a world of difference. And so at some level, that is what we're up against as an industry. That's the bar that we need to clear.
00:30:17.170 - 00:30:35.910, Speaker B: And in some ways, it's an extremely low bar, and we're already crushing them. And it's just overcoming a lot of the barriers to entry and barriers around trust and transparency that we're talking about here that are going to help bring in the future, hopefully hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars into this industry that I think is inevitable.
00:30:36.650 - 00:31:04.320, Speaker A: All right, thank you guys for that. One other thing. I think Defi has gotten a fair criticism in terms of, it's just been a rough user onboarding. We've seen a lot of new bodies come in the last year, year and a half, things like private key management. How many board apes do we need to lose? So maybe you can talk about, what are things like compound and Avio doing to help that user experience? And then maybe you personally, what you'd like to see to kind of help push the industry forward and make it a more user friendly experience.
00:31:05.250 - 00:31:50.160, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess it's no surprise, at least to me. I don't know how on earth my friends would possibly have bought crypto without knowing me. Like, okay, go to Coinbase, get Coinbase, connect your bank account, get a metamask, send stuff to metamask, approve a transaction, send the transaction. That's what, eight steps I just said that are like, take a long time, are not easy to do. So I think there's definitely steps within that that hopefully, whether it's aave or not, can be kind of removed through the process. I think there's some pretty cool patterns we've seen, like the permit pattern, so that removes a transaction, so it's no longer a proven transfer. It's sign a message and then said, submit one transaction for a transfer.
00:31:50.160 - 00:32:07.974, Speaker E: That's quite nice. I think also with some of these l two s, or even other chains reducing transaction time, even that's way nicer. It makes the user experience way better. You're not like, oh, I submitted my transaction. What happened? It's, oh, I submitted my transaction. I see it. A green check mark now.
00:32:07.974 - 00:32:15.880, Speaker E: Good to go. So I think there's a few things that are being worked through and we're getting there. And again, we are early, I think.
00:32:16.490 - 00:32:50.946, Speaker C: Yeah, I think when it comes to compound, it's just about making the system simple. If we can make it digestible for folks, that way they can actually understand what's going on and put in terms, use nomenclature that isn't d five specific. We don't need to have barriers that were man made and whatnot. If we can make these things as simple digestible as possible, it's easy thing to do. But in practice, it actually requires some thoughtful work to make sure you actually put it into their terms and make it accessible. But when it comes to the wallet part, to your point, I don't have friends for the most part who would be able to onboard without me. I think most of them need help.
00:32:50.946 - 00:33:01.654, Speaker C: It's still today. I mean, the metamask experience is still awful. At least you have coinbase wallet trying to do some things in rainbow, but it's still a long ways to go, so we'll see.
00:33:01.692 - 00:33:06.402, Speaker A: But Robin Hood is adding colors to the wallet now. I don't know if you missed the announcement yesterday.
00:33:06.546 - 00:33:06.902, Speaker C: Really?
00:33:06.956 - 00:33:08.594, Speaker A: Yeah, Robin Hood's doing the wallet.
00:33:08.722 - 00:33:12.300, Speaker C: All right, there we go. Never mind, I'm out of the loop. Defi moves too fast for me.
00:33:14.350 - 00:33:27.614, Speaker A: All right, so we're about out of time, so I got one last question. We'll just go down the line. What are some new or yet to come developments with each of your individual projects? And how can people get involved with your community? And are you guys hiring? So, Raphael, let's start with you.
00:33:27.732 - 00:34:04.134, Speaker B: Oh, good question. Yes, we are hiring. If you are not working in this industry and want to be, please come talk with us. Or if you are working in this industry but you're not working on the most exciting project, which is of course what we're doing here at trust token with truefi, with true USD, some very interesting stuff. Please come talk with us. But some exciting developments. So we've got a protocol that leverages stablecoins to do uncollateralized lending on the blockchain, which we see as really a huge next step beyond what Ave and compound have done with over collateralized lending.
00:34:04.134 - 00:34:27.860, Speaker B: And we think that between, with all these kinds of protocols, there's the opportunity to really gobble the entire lending industry that is currently 99% off chain. So we're very excited about that. We've got a bunch of new lending pools that are going to be launching in the next couple of weeks. Some very exciting stuff. But if it is something you're interested in, please come talk with us after. And I've got a couple of people from my team as well who are here as well. We'd love to see you.
00:34:28.790 - 00:34:57.834, Speaker C: Yeah, so I can chill compound endlessly. If anyone wants to talk compound, do come and find me afterwards and I'll tell you about the awesome things as a community member you can do. But my day job is GFX lab. So if you like the idea of a defi powered visa card, dude, come talk to me. Because we are building lots of cool stuff on that front that'll be launching this summer. And that'll be like the first functional, actual crypto card that provides an actual utility beyond just like the novelty of spending cash and coins in the real world. Or if you don't want to talk governance, come over and talk to me.
00:34:57.834 - 00:35:01.850, Speaker C: Governance, because we do a lot of stuff over at compound and on uniswap and other places.
00:35:02.190 - 00:35:03.850, Speaker A: Is GFX hiring?
00:35:04.190 - 00:35:17.330, Speaker C: Yeah, we are always hiring, especially when it comes to governance. Folks, if you know a lot about governance, I would love to talk with you. Because there is a shortage of talent in the industry. It is harder to find someone who knows about protocol governance than is it solidity developers? I kid you not.
00:35:17.480 - 00:35:19.780, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah, we're looking for that too.
00:35:20.150 - 00:35:21.860, Speaker A: All right, Clayton, how about you?
00:35:22.390 - 00:35:46.140, Speaker D: We're always hiring accounting side, finance, technical, anything. Yeah, we're always looking for great people on the kind of newer developments. I'm excited about Dow financial reporting and the standards that are going to develop around that. I mean, this technology, like you were mentioning, enables real time financials. And I think it's very early. There are no standards. A lot of dows aren't really doing anything.
00:35:46.140 - 00:36:13.780, Speaker D: Some are doing some cool stuff, like y'all are working with llama on some cool stuff. And I think that's going to be a cool thing to see unfold. And how daos, especially the bigger ones, like the bigger protocols, report financials for their token holders. And eventually we'll get to where we can do like a real time audit of that and it'll be live. And the whole, like you all said, the quarterly thing, all this stuff, Enron, it's gone as we move into this world.
00:36:14.390 - 00:36:16.306, Speaker A: All right, Steven, take us home. All right. Cool.
00:36:16.328 - 00:36:33.740, Speaker E: What am I most excited about? I guess first off, Ave V three. Some of our sick new features include isolation mode, efficiency mode portals. Happy to talk more about what those are. And more importantly, we just launched lens today, which is Ave's decentralized social media platform.
00:36:34.110 - 00:36:35.690, Speaker A: Check it out if you haven't.
00:36:36.110 - 00:36:55.682, Speaker E: Yeah, so you can go to Lens XYZ. Check that out, learn more about it. You can check out one of the community Uis, Lenster XYZ and yeah. Excited to get you guys onboarded. We are hiring. I use workable. You can check out the listings, but they're all over the place.
00:36:55.682 - 00:37:02.930, Speaker E: Or you could connect with me or some of our Ave friends in the front here to learn more about some open positions.
00:37:03.270 - 00:37:20.038, Speaker B: Well, I could just say honored to be on the panel with these four amazing gentlemen. I think this is a group that when the market goes up, we keep building. When the market goes down, we keep building. So stay strong, stay true, keep doing stuff that makes sense. Let's go.
00:37:20.204 - 00:37:22.740, Speaker A: All right, everyone, thank you so much. Enjoy the open bar.
