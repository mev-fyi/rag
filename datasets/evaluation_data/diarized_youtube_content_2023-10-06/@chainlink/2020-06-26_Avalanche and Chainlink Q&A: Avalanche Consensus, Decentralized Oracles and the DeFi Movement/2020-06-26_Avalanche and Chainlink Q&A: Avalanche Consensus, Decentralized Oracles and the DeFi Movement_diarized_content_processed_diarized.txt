00:00:00.570 - 00:00:01.310, Speaker A: Well, hello everybody.
00:00:01.380 - 00:00:13.600, Speaker B: I would like to first off, thank the avalanche, Chainlink and blockchain community in general for joining us today. In addition, I would like to thank Iman Gunsire, the founder of Avalanche, and Sergey Nazarov, the co founder of Chainlink, for joining us today.
00:00:14.450 - 00:00:15.534, Speaker A: I want to go ahead and explain.
00:00:15.572 - 00:00:58.174, Speaker B: The goal of the Q A, which is to allow the community to learn more about the integration between avalanche and Chainlink, exploring which makes this integration unique and beneficial to both the networks and the users of each product. The agenda will be a 30 to 45 minutes firechat chat structure. If you have a question that was not addressed, please feel free to drop by the avalanche social channels or the various chain link social channels after the chat, and we'll do our best to answer them. We'll also add any additional links in the description of the YouTube video once completed, so you can follow up with your research and explore further. So without further ado, I'd like to go ahead and get started with our first question here. So, Eamon, could you go ahead and introduce yourself? Maybe give us a little bit of your background and what your team has built and is currently building?
00:00:58.372 - 00:01:32.374, Speaker A: Sure. Let's see. I'm a professor at Cornell University, or I was until recently. I've worked on peer to peer technologies for quite some time. I was active in cryptocurrencies way before Satoshi. I built the world's first proof of work minted coin called karma in 2002, and since then I worked on identifying the security properties of bitcoin. I found some major flaws in the initial statements made about bitcoin, and we refined the security statements, the security specification for bitcoin.
00:01:32.374 - 00:02:32.058, Speaker A: We worked on increasing the security of coins at rest with the idea of bitcoin vaults, and we improved upon a whole bunch of things with bitcoin covenants. I worked on the Dow hack. I predicted that it could happen, that there were a bunch of flaws that could be exploited, and the hacker did end up using one of the nine flaws that I identified with my coworkers or co authors and did a bunch of other things like bitcoin next generation, which is a lightweight protocol used by waves, eternity and others. And most recently, though, I've been very excited about the Avalanche project. This is a groundbreaking new chain and it has some features not found on any other system at all. And it introduces the third big consensus protocol family to be introduced in the last 45 years. Just to orient the listeners in my area of distributed systems, there were only three breakthroughs when it comes to consensus protocols.
00:02:32.058 - 00:03:07.426, Speaker A: We initially had what we call classical protocols, and these are making a comeback. They're used in permissioned systems, but they're also being used in EOS, Tezos E 20, and so on. And these were known beforehand, and Satoshi thought they're not very good. And so he came up with this proof of work based consensus protocol in 2009. And ever since then, what people have been trying to do is go back and resurrect some of these earlier protocols. And avalanche doesn't resurrect anything. It's just an entirely new approach to the process of consensus that is far more efficient.
00:03:07.426 - 00:03:28.990, Speaker A: So we can achieve scales, we can achieve performance finality and throughput that other coins can only dream of. So I'm really excited about that. And Avalanche has a bunch of other features as well. It innovates across the board that make it suitable for issuing digital assets. We are a digital asset issuance platform, and I'm really excited about what's to come. Perfect.
00:03:29.060 - 00:03:42.820, Speaker B: Well, thank you so much for that introduction. And I know the community is very excited to hear some more details about what you're building. But before we get into that, would love to just know. Sergey, when did you first meet Eman, and how long have you known each other?
00:03:44.390 - 00:04:54.762, Speaker C: So I was aware of Eman's research for some amount of time before we met in person. I think the first time we actually met in person was back in 2016 when the Dow hack happened. And I remember going to an event where Iman was presenting about it. And I went and I spoke to him and I tried to get some more feedback on this or that point because I think at the time that that was a pretty unique evolution in what people were actually doing with this technology. And I've always really been very interested in that. And I immediately felt that in addition to Eamonn's very, very sizable historical contributions to the computer science field and about consensus and all these other categories of things which he has been doing groundbreaking research on, he always had a very practical grasp of a lot of the risks involved in these systems in a way that wasn't theoretical or academic. And so I went and I wanted to kind of see his points of view on the Dow hack, and I was very interested and kind of impressed at some of the predictions and that some of those failures happened.
00:04:54.762 - 00:05:06.700, Speaker C: There was a whole bunch of stuff going on there. But I think that's the first time that I actually in person met with demon and go ahead.
00:05:07.710 - 00:05:14.740, Speaker B: I was just saying, yeah, thanks so much for that. I think it's interesting for people to find out how far back some of this stuff actually goes.
00:05:15.990 - 00:06:26.230, Speaker A: So for my side, Rory, I remember, know, talking to Sarge, and the thing that put Sarge on the map for me was the fact that he was the first that I know a person to realize the importance of oracles for the world to come. And he was also the very first person to realize that we need to make sure that oracles are hardened, that they themselves cannot misbehave. And so his focus on using trusted execution technologies, SGX technologies, to make sure that oracles cannot misbehave, that oracles can be really made trustworthy, was what set him aside. This space is marked by people who do the easy thing. There are so many low lying fruits that are rotten, and you can always take an existing protocol, make a couple of tweaks to it. You can always take something that people know how to do, put a few little trills on it, there's just a couple of little features, and then you can serve it to the masses as if it's new. And here we had instead somebody going the extra mile and a half, developing on a brand new platform, pardoning oracles, making them trustworthy, and expanding what's known, what engineering is capable of.
00:06:26.230 - 00:06:30.540, Speaker A: And so that was a big blip up for me, and it was really great to.
00:06:32.430 - 00:07:08.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's a lot of people that see the value of oracles earlier on, and now it's only coming into the forefront. And I remember having a lot of interesting conversations about all the dynamics there. So I'm thrilled that we're finally able to work together in a very practical way. So I'm sure that folks want to know about avalanche and how that works and the unique properties. So I know you gave a brief initial historical context on that, but if maybe you could give people the fuller context about how it's similar different to other blockchains, what it is that you feel makes it unique.
00:07:08.322 - 00:07:53.890, Speaker A: So there are two features of avalanche, the system that set it aside. And I'm not going to get into the technical details, but I'll give the sort of broad brushstrokes. The consensus protocol is the number one thing that sets avalanche apart, and it's a huge difference. So as I mentioned before, there had only been two different approaches to the problem of consensus, and avalanche is the third one in 45 years of research. The previous approaches suffer from drawbacks. People understand that proof of work has a bunch of limitations. It's limited in scale that we know, and you can't arbitrarily make the block sizes bigger and bigger and bigger to scale up, because then you get decentralization.
00:07:53.890 - 00:08:49.558, Speaker A: And also there is, of course, leak of value from proof of work to people who are mining on the opposite side. What we see now is a bunch of people going back to the 80s, going back to the 90s, going back to protocols that Satoshi knew about and discarded because they're too fragile and adopting those for the basis of their proof of stake chains. And that's okay, maybe that could be made to work. But all of those protocols in their mode of operation, deeply rely on everybody hearing from everybody else. They were designed for coordinating things like parliaments. In fact, the very first paper, the very first paper with a proof in it, in the space, has the word parliament in it. Think of it as they're designing a protocol for a group of 100 senators to come to a decision, and it's very difficult to coordinate a group of 100 or so elected nodes on the Internet because they will have to change.
00:08:49.558 - 00:09:27.780, Speaker A: We know nodes die. We know there is turnover. We know what's called churn in these systems, and it becomes very difficult to coordinate what decisions were taken. All of these protocols typically involve n squared communication, and at times they might require n cubed leader election. So these are really expensive operations, and they thus are unable to scale, certainly, they're unable to scale in the number of participants. So if I look at, for example, what Ethereum 20 is trying to do, they're trying to scale to 64 validators, and that's a tiny number. Libra 28, Zuckerberg and friends.
00:09:27.780 - 00:10:01.190, Speaker A: Let's take a look at EOS 21 block producers. These are really small numbers. They're prone to cartel formation. We've already seen this happen. What would be fantastic if anybody could do it was a consensus protocol that could accommodate thousands of participants. And that's what the avalanche paper did. It introduced a new way of communication, a new way of coordinating a really large group where I don't have to talk to everybody else to have assurance that we all, as an ensemble, are making the same choices, which is the problem that lies at the heart of consensus.
00:10:01.190 - 00:10:28.994, Speaker A: As a result, avalanche is capable of making finalization within a second to 2 seconds. So think about that for a second. So that time for bitcoin is about an hour. So a lot of Ethereum people think that Ethereum finalizes in 14 seconds. It doesn't. You have to wait a substantial period of time for ethereum transactions to be permanent as well. So it's very difficult to get to about a second latency.
00:10:28.994 - 00:11:01.582, Speaker A: And that's exactly what we advertise. In reality, our testnet is much faster. Those of you who have experimented with the avalanche testnet know that it's actually finalized in about 300 milliseconds. We expect that as the network grows we'll hit about a second. But we kind of have a history of under promise over deliver here. So we're the only protocol that can promise that as far as I know without a decentralization trade off. At the same time our throughputs are through the roof.
00:11:01.582 - 00:11:31.738, Speaker A: I remember once talking to bitcoin core developers in Malta with Adam and Peter Walla and so on and they looked at me and said look, we could make the block size a little bigger, but you can't arbitrarily make it bigger and reach visa scale. And they were right. That family of protocols, you really cannot get to 5000 transactions per second. Our testnet today is capable of achieving 6500 transactions per second. So it's very, very quick. Things finalize in a second. It's very fast.
00:11:31.738 - 00:11:59.534, Speaker A: So 6000 transactions per second faster than visa and it accommodates up to a million participants or more. It can accommodate millions of nodes that actually validate, actually produce blocks. They're not onlookers. They're not just checking the blocks and saying yes, they're actually participating in the block selection algorithm. They play the role of miners and up to a million of them. Anybody could participate in avalanche. Anybody could benefit.
00:11:59.534 - 00:12:46.270, Speaker A: So that's big benefit number one, the second benefit or the second breakthrough behind avalanche is a different one. So almost every coin, and there are about 6000 of them today, almost all of them copied the network model from Satoshi. So what Satoshi did was he said, look, there's going to be a single coin, it's going to serve as money and it's going to have one virtual machine that defines how that coin operates. And it's going to have one homogeneous network that supports that coin and that virtual machine. That's the perfectly reasonable thing for bitcoin and everybody else copied it. So now where are we today? Well, we are at a point where people want to introduce their own digital assets and they want to control the full lifecycle of the asset. They want to control what happens.
00:12:46.270 - 00:13:13.958, Speaker A: They want to control what happens when unforeseen things happen. They want to control jurisdiction. Think about it from the point of view of an enterprise or a company that wants to issue assets. All of them look at the situation and they say, look, I could issue on top of a public chain, but I would lose control of my coin. I wouldn't know what performance I would get. I would not be able to make any kind of a statement. In fact, my legal department would come after me because I can't control my network that actually implements my asset.
00:13:13.958 - 00:13:38.942, Speaker A: So what's there to do? Well, then they flop to the other side and they say, okay, well, I'm going to start my consortium. I'm going to have a permissioned coin. And then they start one of these little proof of concepts within a permission system. And by now we have enough evidence that permission networks go nowhere. The consortium fall apart. Permission systems are not here to stay long term. So is there a middle ground? And avalanche is that middle ground.
00:13:38.942 - 00:14:14.106, Speaker A: That's what got us going. That's what we added. On top of the revolutionary avalanche consensus protocol is a new network model where anybody can issue a new coin, where anybody, when issuing that new coin, can determine two additional things. They determine the virtual machine that powers and defines the behavior of the coin, and they get to determine who participates in their network. They can create what we call sub networks that can communicate with each other. So avalanche is able to span that space between fully public networks and fully private permission networks. So you can have semi open networks.
00:14:14.106 - 00:14:40.070, Speaker A: You can say things like, look, you can come and join my network, except I don't want the lowest common denominator nodes. I want people with beefier, bigger nodes. This is not something you can express in a smart contract. Ethereum could not do this. And what you're saying is something out of the code. It's a meta statement. I want you to join if you have a fast network connection and this avoids the possibility of a fork.
00:14:40.070 - 00:15:30.614, Speaker A: Or you can say things that are jurisdictional, that are legal, which is really crucial when you talk to enterprises, when you talk to Wall street. So, for example, you can say something like, I'd like to issue a coin, but I want everybody who's participating to be bound by the GDPR rules on privacy. Again, not something you can say on Ethereum or any other smart contract platform or things like, I'd like to issue a coin, and I want everybody to be bound by us laws. There might be arbitrary changes in the future, and I want to have assurance that when these changes come by, my network will evolve with me. I want my legal department to know that I have full control from my asset on top down to the individual node, the smallest participant in my network. And avalanche is the only system that can do this. The OD thing is, I think you remember this very well.
00:15:30.614 - 00:16:00.874, Speaker A: Sergey when smart contracts were coming up, there was a large group of people who had essentially blinders on. They said, look, we've got bitcoin. Why do we need anything else? And they're partially motivated by the fact that there are a bunch of bitcoin clones that are useless, and you really don't need a bitcoin clone. They're right. Those things are all shitcoins. But they've missed the point that smart contracts are a big, revolutionary step. In the same vein, what a lot of people are missing today is the control over the network.
00:16:00.874 - 00:16:28.700, Speaker A: You need this level of control. We know this from the Dow hack. We know this from the various different out of band interventions that had to happen on just about every real chain. And when stuff hits the fan, you got to be able to go to your network and enact a change. When a new legal law gets passed, when a bug is found, when there is a problem in your system, you need to be able to enact those changes. And avalanche is the only one.
00:16:30.830 - 00:17:49.058, Speaker C: I think there's definitely interesting dynamics around both the scalability and the flexibility for different use cases. So I think there is a definite dynamic in our space where people latch on to a certain idea or a certain version of how contracts, smart contracts, should function, and they eliminate a certain flexibility. So I think the place where I see a lot of overlap in our architectural decisions is not necessarily that you're saying that people have to build a chain in this way or that way, and they have to follow this rule set or that rule set. They have to have this membership model, or that membership model, or these conditions or those conditions. I think the interesting thing, and I think this is what people are trying to go towards more in the blockchain space, is a flexibility for all the use cases that the blockchain space encompasses. So the blockchain space may have started out with bitcoin, and I think you're right, that bitcoin at the time when it was starting, was a very unique and amazing idea. And it's very logical that it's focused around the single token, and the single token is there to incentivize mining, and you have to kind of get it going right.
00:17:49.058 - 00:18:49.990, Speaker C: And now it's come to a life of its own, where it's this alternative asset, and that's kind of seemingly what people are comfortable with that blockchain being about. And that's fine, and that's what that blockchain can be about. And then there's people that they seek to layer on, like L2 solutions or liquid or any number of other things onto that environment. And that's one approach to flexibility, right, that we see. So there is one approach where people try to say, like, here's my base layer, and my base layer will stay focused on this category of blockchain transactions, and then here's my way to attain flexibility, which is these L2 systems. But I think that the approach that you're taking is a complete redefinition. And because of the experience that you've had in successfully doing redefinition, which not many people have had, you have a likelihood of being able to achieve redefinition rather than, as you put it, kind of copying and adding some additional twists.
00:18:49.990 - 00:19:50.682, Speaker C: So I think the fascinating thing about the redefinition that you're pursuing is the scalability. I mean, scalability is obviously very necessary, but this other flexibility is something that I'm seeing more and more environments and more and more desire for. And I think it's a very logical dynamic. It's a dynamic similar to the one that we have where people can compose these oracle networks with different levels of privacy, different levels of membership, different connections to private data sources. And even we're trying to bake in now more and more privacy at the oracle mechanism level, which relates to that trusted execution work that you mentioned, where now the oracle mechanism can also generate its own set of privacy. Like, I find that privacy in many cases is important. So I think this is where another place where our architectural kind of thinking is very similar in that you want a system that achieves, not a dogmatic like, you have to do it this way.
00:19:50.682 - 00:20:33.122, Speaker C: If you don't do it this way, then you can go elsewhere. I can't think of a better word, but that is not really very inclusive. That will naturally have limitations about the categories of contracts you could capture. And I think people are realizing that and trying to restructure their systems. And that there is a system that is from step one structured that way, is an interesting kind of principles, first principles based. This is the basic foundations of this system approach, which will have a lot of benefits baked into it. With this type of flexibility, I think it might just now be useful to think about oracles.
00:20:33.122 - 00:21:11.540, Speaker C: And how do you see oracles fitting into a system that has so much flexibility and all the different contract types that a system like this would power? Because as I see it, you would have chains about insurance. There would be an insurance chain, there'd be a derivatives chain, another defi chain, and you would have all these different environments that due to this flexibility, are focused on specific subsets of contracts. But then the oracles also, from my point of view, need to be flexible enough to meet the requirements of that specific subset of contracts. So I'd be thrilled to hear how you look at that.
00:21:11.910 - 00:21:39.098, Speaker A: Absolutely. Let's see. So let's start maybe at the very top level. So what avalanche then gives you is this network of networks, network of subnetworks, each running potentially different virtual machines with different properties. So you can have an EVM subnetwork on avalanche. You can have a WASM subnetwork on avalanche. We're, I think, one of the few platforms that plans to support both.
00:21:39.098 - 00:22:34.558, Speaker A: We support the EVM today. We plan to support wasm very shortly. We have test code starting now. So this is a brand new, very exciting world. In a similar fashion, I imagine that oracles, which are absolutely crucial for connecting blockchains to the real world, to be emitting information into separate subnetworks. You do not want to be spamming your network, your main network with oracle information rate of, I don't know, 1000 tps, because then suddenly you lose a substantial portion of your throughput to just oracle information that might not be necessary. So on avalanche, what we can do that I'm really excited about pursuing with you is the notion of graduated subnetworks where chainlink emits information at different rates and nodes subscribe to these channels at whatever level is comfortable for them.
00:22:34.558 - 00:23:17.274, Speaker A: If you find that you don't want your permanent block space filled with enormous oracle data, then you do not need to subscribe to the high throughput Oracle subnetworks. Another thing we can do that other people cannot do is that on these subnetworks you can define a virtual machine where subsequent information from an oracle outdates and deletes older information. So if your node or marks as deletable, rather let me mark it this way. So this allows nodes to follow the latest, greatest oracle information. And if they so choose, they can prune old information from their blockchains. They can keep them. The archival nodes will keep them.
00:23:17.274 - 00:24:10.066, Speaker A: You definitely need a record. This is not to suggest that we have a mutable blockchain, but I would like Oracle subnetworks to be able to prune old data that is not of use to the operator of that node. There will be archival nodes, of course, that keep the oracles accountable, that record everything for eternity. That should happen, of course, for sure, but it should be possible for your average light node to be able to prune old information. So that's the second thing we can do. And the third thing that I'm super excited about is open innovation for others to build around the information emitted by your oracles. Ava makes it very, very easy, or rather avalanche makes it really easy for other people to take oracle information and to build revolutionary new things such as perpetual swaps and so forth, directly on top of the oracle stream emitted by your nodes.
00:24:10.066 - 00:24:46.758, Speaker A: And that I'm really excited about. And when you have a scalability improvement that isn't just incremental, when you go from doing say ten to 20 tps to 6000 tps, that's a game changer. When your finality goes from always 14 seconds behind the market to right at market, that's a game changer. Right now, Dexes, as you well know, are trailing the market. You go to a Dex if you can't go anywhere else. Dexes are an exchange of last resort. But Dexes can be far better than the centralized exchanges that we've got.
00:24:46.758 - 00:24:59.820, Speaker A: Dexs can actually provide a much better user experience to regular retail users and we enable this in a way that I don't know of any other blockchain going anywhere near. So I'm really excited about what's to.
00:25:01.230 - 00:25:49.958, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I'm excited as well. I think there's these dynamics around an oracle mechanism that's flexible enough to meet all the requirements of the different subnets. So that you have an oracle mechanism that has the ability to manage credentials, access high quality external data. And also having that data already integrated is a big help. So that developers in the ecosystem where they're building those contracts like Avalanche, they can come in and they already have a large data rich environment from which to build. They don't need to go and build an oracle mechanism or worry about that whole dynamic. The second dynamic that I think is quite important is the ability to scale the security of the oracle mechanism together with the security of the subnet.
00:25:49.958 - 00:25:57.230, Speaker C: And as I understand it, the subnets will also be able to scale in security. As there's more value, you'll be able to add nodes.
00:25:59.650 - 00:26:50.382, Speaker A: Go ahead, can we talk about this? This is a pet peeve of mine. So if I look around at various different systems that have been built so far, especially at the smart contract platforms, I see a lot of innovation, but I also see some fundamental mistakes they have committed. One of the biggest fundamental mistakes is that most other chains that I know of are oblivious to the value created at the app level. So what do I mean by that? For example, we had tether on top of bitcoin, and as far as bitcoin was concerned, as far as the bitcoin miners were concerned, tether was just a hash stored on bitcoin. They didn't know that that was a valuable different asset. You had the entirety of the land records of the state of Georgia on bitcoin. And again, miners were securing something of high value, but it was just a hash for them.
00:26:50.382 - 00:27:15.602, Speaker A: Just fundamentally, by virtue of the architecture, they're oblivious to it. It wasn't exposed to them. And now you might think, well, Ethereum fixes this and it doesn't. In Ethereum, the miners are again oblivious. All they know is that there's an ERC 20 token. They don't know that this ERC 20 token is a real estate token or it represents gold or represents something really valuable they cannot partake. To them, it's just bytecode after bytecode.
00:27:15.602 - 00:27:47.838, Speaker A: They do not know the semantics of the asset. They don't even know that this bytecode implements an asset. In avalanche, it's completely different. Digital assets are a first class abstraction. You create an asset of a certain kind, it might be hard capped, it might be soft capped, et cetera, et cetera. It might be multi minted or single minted, et cetera. There are lots of different asset types, but the miners know what kind of asset they're mining, or rather the validators, the participants, the block producers, know what kind of asset they're supporting, and they can partake in that value creation.
00:27:47.838 - 00:28:25.390, Speaker A: They can say things like, this is a real estate transaction, and you have to pay a different fee structure when it comes to this particular asset. And in fact, in this subnetwork to participate, there might be a different fee structure for each sub network that allows those participants to collect different kinds of transaction fees. This creates a graduated validator hierarchy. And so we're one of the few coins that creates a rich ecosystem. It's not just an AWS node that's running on avalanche. These nodes can get to do different things for different assets. So again, for your oracle information, you would have different participants.
00:28:25.390 - 00:29:07.718, Speaker A: And depending on the value of that information, you can pay them more, or the consumers can pay them more. They can demand more creative payment structures from them. They can say, look, I'm going to give you gold information up to the minute or maybe up to the second or whatever the information is, and I want to be paid accordingly in whatever unit, whatever digital asset they want. So they're not beholden to avox, the coin that we have. They're not beholden when forcing a particular payment structure or a fee structure by exposing what's going on to every participant. We provide two things. One, a new economy to be formed, and two, a security decision to be made in an informed fashion.
00:29:07.718 - 00:29:15.102, Speaker A: You know exactly how many nodes are participating in each subnetwork and you know the security you're getting for it, right.
00:29:15.236 - 00:30:46.662, Speaker C: I think that's the interesting dynamic that I noticed in these architectural decisions where the subnetwork can start out at a more efficient, smaller size depending on the value on that network, and then that subnetwork as a collection of block producers and transactions securing independent, civil resistant entities can then grow with the value on that chain. And this fundamental decision to grow that set of block producers is something that creates a lot of efficiency because you're not necessarily taking all the data and giving it to all the people and you're not necessarily, maybe there are certain block producers that you want certain privacy guarantees from, or certain, like you put it, jurisdictional guarantees. And this architectural kind of decision making about how you compose what you call a subnet, it's actually very compatible with our model. Our model is you can choose the Oracle network composition based on all this data that's generated about oracle network nodes. And so what this means is somebody could have a subnet of chinese only blockchain nodes because that's the legal requirement that the data has to stay in China. And then they can have oracles that are also in China, or somebody else could have a requirement where they want a globally distributed, pseudonymous 1000 node subnet and they can set the rule set for that. But then the oracle mechanism should also have a way to scale with the security of the data that's triggering all of those events.
00:30:46.662 - 00:32:15.110, Speaker C: Because while the block producers are securing those transactions, I feel that if those transactions are controlled by other systems, then assuring the end to end security of the whole setup within this same kind of scale, the security as the value in the system grows model is also important. And I think this is one of the first things that when we began talking about working together in integration, that we saw compatibility in how someone in this integration, they could make a subnet, they could build some network. It could start out with, I don't know, five or seven nodes. They could have an oracle network of a few nodes, and that gives them efficiency, right? And that gives them a certain whatever dynamic they want. And then as the size of the subnet scales, the size and the composition of the oracle network can also scale. And then the important dynamic from what I've seen so far becomes how do people make informed decisions about nodes how do people decide what are the nodes that I want to compose into my collection of block producers or my collection of oracle operators? And I think both of our systems seek to give people that guidance, right? They seek to allow people to make informed decisions about the composition of these kind of separate concerns, but equally important kind of systems as they make up the end to end security of one application. Does that sound right to you?
00:32:15.180 - 00:33:01.842, Speaker A: That's exactly right. And that's why I was so excited when I first spoke to you. The thing I don't understand is why did it take ten years to realize that these are real big concerns? And it kind of makes me a little disheartened. It's like disheartened rather, that other people did not see this. They missed the importance of being able to reason about security, being able to expose what's happening at the higher application levels, to the lower levels of the system, to the nodes at layer one, and to provide composable, informed, transparent systems. So I'm really excited about what we can do together, and I'm really excited about what's to come for blockchains. These were really big roadblocks in actually deploying functional, real world applications.
00:33:01.842 - 00:33:34.590, Speaker A: Go talk to anybody. I don't know, like insiders know this. So the firm r three has done hundreds, hundreds of proofs of concept. I believe that of the Fortune 500, I would be shocked if the first 450 have not already built a blockchain solution. They've all built one, they've all tested them, they've dipped the toe in the water, and none of them deployed the thing that they actually built. And the main impediment has been this kind of lack of access. The model was not right for them.
00:33:34.590 - 00:33:40.260, Speaker A: And it's only now, I think, that we are building the right tools for them to take the next step.
00:33:41.350 - 00:34:07.660, Speaker C: I think the way I see it is there's an evolution to what people seek to solve, because the evolution of our space was people going from nothing to bitcoin. And that was great. And that was a momentous thing that changed my life. Changed a lot of people's changed your life. Huge event. It's not to be underappreciated. And it's absolutely a massive thing and it still provides and underpins a lot of value in the space.
00:34:07.660 - 00:35:27.640, Speaker C: And then I think people kind of tried to push that model to a certain point and people made decisions about where do they want to push that. Do they want to push a certain feature set and risk what they have? Do they want to evolve in a certain way. And the decisions made there then left a hole, a feature set hole, right? And then the subsequent devolutions like Ethereum and others, I think they did an amazing job of taking us towards these scriptable dynamics where they once again filled a hole, right? And that hole was allowed to form because the people that built the infrastructure that was already widely used, they made decisions about kind of what they want to protect. They want to protect a certain subset of value, a certain subset of dynamics that they want to own, right? Like they want to own digital gold. And so smart contracts aren't super critical, right? And then there's now, I think a subsequent evolution where people are trying to match up, and I think everybody in the smart contract space is trying to do this. They're trying to match up how smart contracts are built with the dynamics that web developers engage in. And they're trying to achieve the same type of efficiency between the applications throughput plus the speed at which people can build.
00:35:27.640 - 00:37:01.118, Speaker C: And I think it's these flexible systems, whether other systems will evolve into flexible systems, whether L2s will give flexibility to those systems, whether the system like yours, that has a fundamental principled initial architecture around that flexibility. But I see everybody going now towards how do we allow blockchains to reach this extreme flexibility and this throughput that's at web level and also the user experience around the developer, user experience that marries efficiency with security so that developers that aren't familiar with all the security assumptions in the blockchain space, they can kind of drop in and start engaging in the same web development kind of behaviors. But the infrastructure is so well built that it gives them kind of built in security. And that's where a lot of this flexibility, I think is critical, because if you start forcing developers to have to rearchitect their infrastructure or re architect some kind of L2. Now the developer that you wanted to be building a decentralized financial application, like a three man team or a five man team that realistically come from the web developer world and they're kind of used to composing various other systems into a working application and they're good at that and they know how to do that. Now you're taking them and you're saying, hey, why don't you learn a bunch of cryptography and private key management, security dynamics and other security assumptions. Maybe you want to roll your own crypto.
00:37:01.118 - 00:37:07.974, Speaker C: Let's take you on that adventure, which we know where that adventure goes. And that's what I've seen a lot of.
00:37:08.012 - 00:37:08.214, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:08.252 - 00:38:40.274, Speaker C: I've seen a lot of people that had a good development team that could have built a good defi application, sink massive amounts of time into solving some infrastructure problem which even though they had a solid application idea, they didn't build that as well as they could have. And the infrastructure they built because they're not infrastructure engineers, because they're not cryptographers like you, because they're not computer science experts like you, or the people on our team or other teams that focus on infrastructure. When that infrastructure either fails or is deemed by them to be inadequate, it's something that stops them from continuing to. So I think this is really the next generation of things that infrastructure like Avalanche and Chainlink are seeking to change where developers can come in efficiently, use highly secure systems at both the layer one level and also at the middleware level in our case. And I think we're both excited about seeing these smart contract developers come in with a two three person team like they do in web developer land, get their seed funding from an incubator or wherever, and knock out a world class application with these superior trust dynamics, which in the current climate, I think those trust dynamics are going to become more and more important because people are going to be depending on these digital systems for trust more and more. I think we're on the same page about a lot of this stuff. I'd also be thrilled we're coming down on time.
00:38:40.274 - 00:38:56.550, Speaker C: There's like one or two questions we still want to cover. So I think one of the questions is also what are the next big things happening for avalanche? And then we can switch to how we view success in the space. But I guess the first question is what are the next big things that are planned from your side?
00:38:56.620 - 00:39:27.666, Speaker A: Sure. So let's see. So in avalanche, we just concluded our testnet, our Denali testnet. We broke a record by having 1200 block producers in our testnet that I believe is the biggest collection of nodes to engage in a consensus protocol to date, ever. No other protocol could have achieved that. You can't get there using the technologies that other people are proposing. So I'm really excited about that.
00:39:27.666 - 00:40:07.966, Speaker A: So Denali is going to give way to our next network, which is Everest. And we have a program called Avax. And through that program we incentivize a large number of groups to build on top of the avalanche platform. Lots of exciting solutions are coming in the identity space, in the exchange, the decentralized exchange space in tokens of all kinds, nfts and so forth on top of avalanche. These are all in the pipeline and I'm really excited to see them. On July eigth, we are having our public sale, and we're having our main net at around that time if all goes well. And I'm really excited about all of those.
00:40:07.966 - 00:40:31.286, Speaker A: And after that, for me, comes a long process of slowly trickling out the various technologies that we've been building in the lab. So avalanche, the platform. I'm in a hurry to get out the door. We are probably one of the fastest moving teams. We got funded only about a year and a few months ago. We're already out there without mainnet. Many other projects take multiple years to not build anything at all.
00:40:31.286 - 00:40:50.090, Speaker A: So we're here. We have lots and lots of exciting things to expose and open up to the world. We have new digital asset types, some built around oracle information, some entirely new kinds of assets that nobody has ever thought about before. So I'm really excited about what's to come on top of the avalanche network.
00:40:51.070 - 00:41:01.550, Speaker C: Yeah, it sounds like an exciting time. I know it's nerve wracking having a main net go live and all these other dynamics. So I'm sure there's very strong coffee in that cup.
00:41:02.130 - 00:41:17.342, Speaker A: It's actually tea, but yes. No, my team is good, and it's actually fantastic. I can't say I got too much sleep in the last few weeks, and I know they didn't get too much sleep, but we're having a ball. It's just a fantastic.
00:41:17.406 - 00:41:49.182, Speaker C: It's fine. I can tell you that's completely, for people that move things forward, that's completely normal. You should tell them. You should tell them that when the main net launches that it might slow down. But that's what I was thinking. But I was like, okay, we're going to launch the main net, and it's all going to become more stable, and the exact opposite happens. So I think that you're going to see the people who can really tough it out and go through it, and those are the people that you really want on your team anyway.
00:41:49.182 - 00:41:56.880, Speaker C: But I think the way to view it is kind of just the beginning. If you make something worthwhile, because after the main net, it should really pick up.
00:41:57.190 - 00:42:22.202, Speaker A: No, I'm really excited, though. So I can see Wall street from here, and there is so much to change. And the main thing that we are focusing on, Sergey, is not Ava as money. So I think Bitcoin should be money. Bitcoin should duke it out with the dollar, and the dollar is, I don't know what it's backed by, by a bunch of guys who make arbitrary decisions. They print 2 trillion a day sometimes. Right? So bitcoin has the upper hand in that fight.
00:42:22.202 - 00:42:46.338, Speaker A: It's fantastic to see ethereum is doing interesting things. I think they captured it best when they said world computer. Even though they're trying to walk away from it, it's really the world computer. We are doing something different that these people aren't doing. And if I look at what's actually happening on Wall street, it's so backwards. And we as an area have so much to bring. We can revolutionize what Wall street does.
00:42:46.338 - 00:42:56.740, Speaker A: We can revolutionize how people buy assets, how they trade them. We can bring wealth to a much broader range of people around the globe. And this is what keeps me going through all this.
00:42:57.910 - 00:43:12.362, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. I think that brings me to the next and final question that we have is kind of, how do you define, ultimately define success in this space? I think you've kind of, kind of mentioned it here, but how do you view that?
00:43:12.496 - 00:43:45.218, Speaker A: I think if in five to ten years, what I would like to do is to have completely redone the financial infrastructure for the globe, nothing less. If it's anything less, if we are playing around in the same sandbox, we're still playing the same battles. If we are still fighting it out among ourselves, then we have failed as an area. Crypto is not a zero sum game. The great majority of wealth is out there. Just look at anybody's balance sheets. There is a lot of value out there that is not in blockchain form.
00:43:45.218 - 00:44:23.470, Speaker A: I would like to get at least some of it, if not all of it, onto a fully functioning, fast, secure, trustworthy platform. And I've done my best to build that platform. And so I will show by example where necessary. There's also, let's not underestimate this. In the defi space, there are lots of incredibly bright, incredibly energetic projects. And so for those people, we have provided the right platform to take their work to the next level. I also see areas that are free for the taking, and we will lead by example, by issuing new asset types and showing the world, hey, you can do far more with crypto than you ever thought possible.
00:44:23.470 - 00:44:29.860, Speaker A: This is not a zero sum game. It's not just a game of being money. There is so much more here. It's going to be so awesome.
00:44:31.350 - 00:45:23.458, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a very worthy goal. And I think people don't fully see the depth of the impact that can have on them in both the developed market and the emerging markets. It aligns very strongly with my own goal. And my own values of this space can really be about a lot more than it is right now. And that's not to say anything negative. The space needs to evolve, and you need bitcoin to start it, and then you need people to put value into tokens, and those tokens to create the value that we're now seeing flow into DeFi, right? Like, if those tokens weren't generated, what would be flowing into Defi? But I think we're now at a stage where the worthy goal is to take this, you could say mainstream, but not mainstream in the sense of I go and I'm using blockchain, whatever, for buying my pizza. Right.
00:45:23.458 - 00:46:47.374, Speaker C: I don't know if that's necessarily how that's going to look. I think this is really a back end problem, and it deals with how you change the systemic financial risk in developed markets, how you change people's access to various things in developed markets and in emerging markets. It's even about giving people the ability to have certain types of contracts at all, having a savings account at all, having insurance at all, which is a zero to one dynamic that technology has brought there through telecoms and then the Internet. And I think the next big dynamic is these trustworthy, financially kind of reinvention contracts that the emerging market will see replace their local dysfunctional financial systems. Right? And I think the amazing thing is that we might be in a unique time where all the crunches around people's faith and brands and whether they can actually meet their obligations means that all this digital trust that's backed by cryptography and uniquely backed by blockchains can actually get adopted much faster. And so I think it's definitely the right time to be working on it. And I feel like me and you and a few of the other people in this space, some of which you mentioned and others are all in their own way trying to move all of this forward.
00:46:47.374 - 00:46:56.282, Speaker C: And they've been doing it for years. And I think even if it happens this year or next year, whenever, we'd still be doing it for years until it happens.
00:46:56.436 - 00:47:16.946, Speaker A: We're in it for life. We're in it for life. We're committed to this. The world needs a transformation. I think we've seen information technologies transform the way we do a lot of things. The Internet, of course, was the big, big jump, and now we're seeing it. Technologies come into taxi hailing and suddenly it becomes a billion dollar unicorn.
00:47:16.946 - 00:47:56.100, Speaker A: You've got Uber, the hotel industry is disrupted, but what's the core idea? Well, they brought some computation, and they brought some little bit of a connectivity glue kind of a technology. Well, look at blockchains and look at the potential. It's thousands of times bigger than what's possible with these small, single vertical applications. The world of value ahead of us is immense, and the way that we can transform the world is huge. So this is why, yes, it's a little bit tiring to go to mainnet, but I wake up and I jump out of bed and I get really excited because there's so much to absolutely iman, great.
00:47:56.710 - 00:48:26.654, Speaker C: It's been fantastic chatting with you. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us about all these interesting topics. And good luck with the main net launch and excited that we're working together to help move everything forward in the larger blockchain industry. And I'm thrilled to see that it's kind of progressing and that a lot of your research of you and your team is being turned into reality. So thank you very much for working with us and for jumping on this call and chatting about everything.
00:48:26.772 - 00:48:31.200, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Sergey. Always great to chat with you and very excited about what we can do together.
00:48:31.650 - 00:48:33.214, Speaker C: Me too. Thank you.
00:48:33.412 - 00:48:51.794, Speaker B: Excellent, everybody. Well, that wraps up our video Q A for today. Again, special thank you to Eben and Sergey for joining us. All the community members viewing the stream. Special shout out, obviously, to Jay from Ava Labs behind the scenes, helping me put all this together as well. We're looking to do a lot more of these in the future, so make sure to subscribe. Thank you again for all your time, gentlemen.
00:48:51.794 - 00:48:55.174, Speaker B: And I look forward to seeing avalanche develop in the future as well.
00:48:55.372 - 00:48:56.646, Speaker C: Great. Thank you very much.
00:48:56.668 - 00:48:56.994, Speaker A: Rory.
00:48:57.042 - 00:48:57.334, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:48:57.372 - 00:48:58.580, Speaker B: Thank you, everybody. Have a great day.
