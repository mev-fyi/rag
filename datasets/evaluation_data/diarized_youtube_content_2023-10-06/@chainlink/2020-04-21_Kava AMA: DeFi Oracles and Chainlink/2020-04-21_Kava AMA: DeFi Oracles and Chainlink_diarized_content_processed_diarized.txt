00:00:02.090 - 00:00:29.126, Speaker A: Well, welcome, everybody, to another live stream here on the Chainlink YouTube channel. My name is Rory. Today I'm joined by young in our korean community manager Aaron Choi, the head of business development for Kava, and then Snake, who will be doing some translation, some services as well. And I'd like to welcome everybody. Young in will be hosting this live stream. We'll be doing both kind of English and korean translations throughout. So if you have any questions, I'll be monitoring the YouTube channel.
00:00:29.126 - 00:00:34.440, Speaker A: Feel free to ask them there. Otherwise I will turn it over to Young N and go ahead and get us started.
00:00:46.730 - 00:01:32.070, Speaker B: Global marketing AMA streaming project to cover down. So yeah, integration icon and Sigurd. And yeah, do people even amen? And yeah, don't email then rose and don't you live streaming as a team? But. And yeah, YouTube Young Song Description.
00:01:40.930 - 00:01:41.342, Speaker C: Please.
00:01:41.396 - 00:01:44.000, Speaker B: Introduce Kappa to the community people.
00:01:50.130 - 00:02:32.150, Speaker C: Hey, everyone. Thank you for having me, Youngen and the link team. I'm Aaron. I'm the head of BD here at Kava, and I wanted to introduce what our project is. I guess quickly in a short sentence is a built on top of the Cosmos SDK. We are building a lending platform that uses cdps collateralized debt positions that people can open and can take short term loans using our stablecoin called USDX. This system is already out in the wild.
00:02:32.150 - 00:02:53.710, Speaker C: Some people might understand an ethereum based system very similar to what we are building. That's the makerdao system. We are building it though on Cosmos, which means that it'll be natively interoperable between blockchains. And we are proud to say that we are a partner with Link and will be using their Oracle solutions as one of our providers.
00:03:19.890 - 00:04:09.560, Speaker D: Error? Tambo Tap go. Tangigan is a tetrahand postmaster SDK Entertainment solution blockchain Gunbo See Jan got finance PNB. Could you go bitcoin? Could you go depurl, CDP, Rochi Oracle pattern or so Kagokando execution? And.
00:04:23.250 - 00:04:29.730, Speaker B: Erin, I will give you the simple question. Okay. What brought you here in blockchain industry?
00:04:31.110 - 00:05:16.962, Speaker C: Sure. This is an interesting question. I've personally been in blockchain since 2012, so it's been quite a long time, I guess I started off in bitcoin before we were talking about blockchain. I heard about it from a friend and I got interested and haven't really let go of it ever since. Working in full time in blockchain industry, though I started in 2016, I had joined BTCC, one of the oldest chinese exchanges that was trading bitcoin back in the day, and I was the VP of their international exchange. And from there I left BTCC in 2018 after our acquisition. And then I started off another exchange called GJ.com.
00:05:16.962 - 00:05:37.080, Speaker C: And then after that, I sold off that exchange and found Kaba. So it's been a very good, interesting, short, I guess, career time that I've had directly in blockchain. But personally, I've been in it a very long time and I really do enjoy this space.
00:05:51.470 - 00:07:07.970, Speaker D: Chain run and go. Sir, I'll give you bitcoin industry, but internship jungyam butan blockchain. Okay, Kalia Katin open for your. So, you know, Haggisaki throw us off check in Kilobom Chungara, could you but covers but yeah, but yeah. Gay mirror pool prot tablet.
00:07:10.390 - 00:07:17.122, Speaker B: They come time without take a top on the ceremony block ten.
00:07:17.176 - 00:07:17.780, Speaker C: Okay.
00:07:25.430 - 00:07:34.026, Speaker B: Double till moon and block ten, if you don't mind. And there's a tag. Smida. Aaron, what do you think of the.
00:07:34.048 - 00:08:58.482, Speaker C: Blockchain prospects in terms of what the future? I think for blockchain, I think that there's a huge opportunity. We're all building very interesting technology that can provide a lot of different industries, not just financial, not just technical, but all the different industries out there with a lot of efficiencies, a lot of cost savings, a lot of better trustless systems, more secure. Every single one of these industries will be transformed, which is why I'm very excited and still want to keep on working in the blockchain industry. And I think, of course, specifically for what Kava is doing with Defi, with providing a decentralized service, maybe allowing more people to access these financial services that they might potentially need. Also allowing people to do things trustlessly instead of having to go to a central single organization or company in order to trade or in order to get leverage, takeout loans. I think these will also have very large impacts, particularly as now we're seeing potentially that we are entering in a very volatile economic time. So I think bitcoin was created more than ten years ago in very, very similar situations, maybe even not as crazy as now.
00:08:58.482 - 00:09:06.290, Speaker C: And I think now in these next couple of years, I think we're going to see a lot of opportunities where bitcoin and blockchain can really shine.
00:09:11.290 - 00:10:52.950, Speaker D: Up and asserted potential finance finance community. So man to the ganira Sanchez and obey so like a her so much David and so commune.

Hong Kong is sentence principle.
00:11:18.650 - 00:11:33.180, Speaker B: Yes. Mita, third question. To improve and advance the blockchain industry. What kind of things do we need?
00:11:34.670 - 00:12:27.930, Speaker C: I think to improve the blockchain industry. I think number one is time and patience. I think without these things, without actually spending the time and waiting and building good things where we're not going to have anything good and these things don't come overnight. And of course, we've been working on blockchain for over, let's say five to ten years across our entire industry. But I think there's still a lot more for us to kind of grow. Another piece is to also focus on building more secure applications, more secure companies networks. I think a lot of people, particularly over the last couple of weeks, in the last few days we've been hearing about hacks, we've been hearing about different d five projects having security problems, loopholes exploited.
00:12:27.930 - 00:12:59.800, Speaker C: And when these happen, users of crypto and also mainstream people out there that don't understand crypto might get scared. And when people are scared, they're not going to be using these products. And I think this, again only needs time for companies to prove themselves that they're building very stable, very secure products. And I see that happening over time. But I think these are something that people will still need to wait. I think.
00:13:05.210 - 00:13:47.710, Speaker D: It was again for the don't Jambando Shikani pira Shigan to remain soft and secure. You can Chapoon Chato and Kodira T five production hesito jumpers on bigger song, the blockchain of gigahertz and timbers.
00:14:21.010 - 00:14:40.370, Speaker B: Ronan Itona Days or job? The last question is, was the Kava school in 2020 and could you tell me how you envision the future for the defy and kava?
00:14:40.890 - 00:15:09.818, Speaker C: Sure. So our 2020 goals, we have a few. I think our biggest goal, in which we'll be actually doing very soon, is launching our CDP product on our main net. I think this will happen next month. And so that's our biggest goal for this year. And it sets us up for everything else that we want to do and it's the one that's closest. Further along the lines this year we want to be able to integrate many more, multiple different types of collateral.
00:15:09.818 - 00:16:18.018, Speaker C: So not just BNB, which will be our first type of collateral, but we want to integrate also with bitcoin, ripple, all the other kind of main, major assets. We just did announcement with Okex with their chain, and they're also in the cosmos ecosystem. And we'll be announcing a few more partners very shortly as well that we're all working with. And of course, further along, we really want to allow our stablecoin USDX to integrate with a lot more wallets, a lot more exchanges, a lot more places where users really need liquidity, which will be within specifically crypto applications, as well as potentially non crypto, but financially relevant companies and applications as well. So these are kind of our big three type things that we're looking. And the other question about where I see Defi and Kava, I definitely see that. First off, we really want to build a really secure kind of CDP fundamental layer system.
00:16:18.018 - 00:17:14.120, Speaker C: So that's our major, major focus. When we're finished with that, we want to be able to allow different types of developers to build on top of our protocol that we've built. So we envision building a really strong ecosystem where we have the fundamental layer of the ability to mint USDX, take USDX, and to hold it and to earn and to stake it and to earn a return. And we really envision allowing a different set of developers outside of just kava using what we've built and really allowing much more users and to see more interactions there. I think that's going to be a major focus that we want to build towards that we've seen work in our crypto industry and at the end of the day, that will actually prove out that what we're building is actually going to be useful for us, for the cosmos ecosystem and for all the partners that we are working with.
00:17:35.440 - 00:20:24.100, Speaker D: Similar hedges. Oh, done. GDP Kabab GDP guy, the Tamboy Ama element and gunian chakra but junction Okuro so is a toy guy hundred and PNB finance coinbum lost bitcoin integration. Okay.

If I think it is so kaban and then how we go Kevin, how we go parameter.
00:20:29.100 - 00:20:58.390, Speaker B: Thank you. I will ask you the other part of question which you're gathered from the both community. Okay. The first question is, as we know, kava integrates with Chainlink for trustworthy Oracle so that it makes a stable coin more reliable. Can you explain what kind of advantage kava can get from this integration and what part can be secured by this integration. Technical part can be tough for people to understand. So, can you tell me more?
00:21:05.660 - 00:22:34.592, Speaker C: Let's see. I think with Sokata has chosen Chainlink, mainly because we know that Chainlink has very high quality requirements for all the partners within their ecosystem. So all the different node operators and all the different data sources that they're aggregating, they have a very high quality and very high bar. And also on the technical aspects that they've gone to stop a lot of the different loopholes and different attacks that could happen. Like a lot of their oracles, where civil resistant, they also have security reviewed nodes, and again, they have a proven track record where they've already worked with a lot of the largest projects outside in crypto, and also just using high quality data. I think that, for us, makes us feel that Chainlink as a partner is going to be very strong for us, especially on our security side. As the question has stated, when we run our platform and our cdp, which mits our stablecoin, and when users take out loans, they want to make sure that the price feeds, that our system is looking to close out different cdps or to liquidate.
00:22:34.592 - 00:22:49.960, Speaker C: These things are very secure, that they don't have any problems. If there's any problems, then people could be losing money. And so, of course, we take it very. A very high priority on the partners that work with on this aspect.
00:22:57.240 - 00:24:23.660, Speaker D: The Kadang patano so partnership with get here and there kadang sopanza yoga so kon Saturday Chokan satira took me dudan piran Chokan sacheka doktanbasan on the Chung song for so get and company Manungo nigga cover but Chong San Hogan is a tambour bakugo in paddock price feed so much projected tending chicken like a chingo hani china krone piru and kidnap.
00:24:43.340 - 00:24:56.990, Speaker B: Thank you. And the next question is the DeFi has a hard time overcoming the regulation from the conventional financial institutions to expand the defiance domain. What should we do or what kava should do?
00:24:58.720 - 00:26:11.270, Speaker C: I think DeFi, there will always be issues with regulations, and I don't think that these are real problems, but I think that these are issues that every company will have to face. I think that DeFi, by itself, saying that it's very decentralized means that it shouldn't be in one location and stuck to kind of one set of rules. There are probably like a different set of rules that are online that you have to set for us. I would say that in order to build on top of Defi, in order to, sorry, my dog, in order to expand the RD five domain, we really need to just build more products that users really want, that users across the world really need in order to gain more traction, in order to gain more usage, in order to get more money into the system, in order to provide a lot more value to everybody. So I think that these are, you know, these, these are going to things that we need to focus on.
00:26:17.960 - 00:27:18.790, Speaker D: If I touched man today and book to help my one and if I productive blockchain take out and from projected and value. Patrick, and got to.
00:27:36.100 - 00:27:54.736, Speaker B: Thank you. I think the next question is, I think you've already answered this question, but can you answer it more specifically? Yeah, there is a lot of Oracle network besides Chainlink. Is there any reason to choose Chainlink Oracle solution?
00:27:54.928 - 00:29:17.488, Speaker C: Yeah, so we did take a look at other Oracle solutions, and of course, we've also worked with a few of them as well, but we ultimately chose to be a really deep partner with Chainlink. Number one. The number of partners that Chainlink has is number one. I think with the more partners and also the more nodes, the more data partners that an Oracle provider has is always going to be one of the most important things from a partner standpoint, that they want to be able to trust and look at the quality, the availability and that are we able to kind of get the type of performance that we need. Of course, Chainlink ticks all those boxes again, I said earlier that Chainchenk nodes have a very rigorous security review process. A lot of the partners that Chainlink uses for their nodes are also our own nodes as well. So that also kind of makes us understand that the security model and also that the partners that we've chosen to have as nodes, they've also gone through our own rigorous security process.
00:29:17.488 - 00:29:52.270, Speaker C: And the fact that they've been able to pass ours and chain links makes us feel pretty confident that this will be a very worthwhile partnership. And also, again, having many, many more different data feeds, data partners, it just makes them more decentralized. And I think that's what we want out of a partner that is dealing with data, that it doesn't rely on just one or two sources, centralized sources, that they're able to find the different types of prices and to filter out all the different noise that can be from that.

00:32:16.150 - 00:33:21.574, Speaker B: Thank you. I think this ama takes a long time because of translation, so we should end this ama right now. So I will send all questions to the Kappa team so that community people can get their answers. Okay, then. Thank you, everyone.
00:33:21.692 - 00:33:23.622, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you, everyone.
00:33:23.676 - 00:33:40.490, Speaker A: Thank you, Aaron. Thank you, Snake, for joining us again, everybody. If you'd like to see more of these in the future, just make sure to subscribe to the channel again. Special thanks to the kava team for making this happen, and we look forward to working together in the future. Very excited about what you guys are building. You're moving very quickly and looking forward to following your progress.
00:33:40.650 - 00:33:42.186, Speaker C: Thank you so much, Rory.
00:33:42.378 - 00:33:44.320, Speaker A: Thank you so much, guys. You have a great day.
00:33:44.690 - 00:33:45.418, Speaker B: Bye bye.
00:33:45.514 - 00:33:45.806, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:33:45.828 - 00:33:46.890, Speaker C: Young end. Thank you. Bye.
