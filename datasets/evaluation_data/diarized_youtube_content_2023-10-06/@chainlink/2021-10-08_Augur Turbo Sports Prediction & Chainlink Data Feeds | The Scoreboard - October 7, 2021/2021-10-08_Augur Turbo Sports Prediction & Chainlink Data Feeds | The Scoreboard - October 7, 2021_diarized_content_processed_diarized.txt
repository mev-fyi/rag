00:00:00.090 - 00:00:14.334, Speaker A: Um, you're watching the scoreboard presented by Auger and Chainlink. I'm Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. This is Chewy from Auger. Friday, October 8 how you doing, man?
00:00:14.452 - 00:00:15.358, Speaker B: Doing great, man.
00:00:15.444 - 00:00:21.710, Speaker A: We swapped sides. I hope you don't mind being on a different side of the screen. You know, it's a little uncomfortable, but you know, I like to change things up a little bit.
00:00:21.780 - 00:00:26.600, Speaker B: Hey, don't miss on my rhythm here. I mean, I've been winning this week. We're going back.
00:00:27.130 - 00:01:07.630, Speaker A: If you're just joining us, this is a football show. So why are we on Chainlink YouTube? Well, sports data delivered via the Chainlink Oracle network is used by Auger to settle their permission lists. No limit prediction markets. So chewy and I maybe a future celebrity guest, we'll see if we can pull somebody in. We'll take a look at NFL and NCAA football data and prediction markets on Auger and we'll talk football data supplied by Premium chainlink data providers like the rundown sportsdata IO and sportsmonks. So if you're a developer and you want to use Chainlink sports data in your smart contract, check the links in the description. And if you're a football geek and you want to hear more of my terrible speculation on football and Chewy's thoughtful insight on data, let's talk some football.
00:01:07.630 - 00:01:24.438, Speaker A: I did terrible last week. You did pretty good. I was running down the list and it's like every x is a bad choice. Oh, that's Andy's and every circle is a good choice and oh, that's Chewy's. So Chewy knows data. A few of your great picks. I don't want to go through all of them because there were too many good ones but a couple of the really good ones.
00:01:24.438 - 00:01:28.440, Speaker A: Cleveland over Minnesota was a great one last week. What happened there?
00:01:29.530 - 00:01:36.780, Speaker B: Just Cleveland's too good all around in my opinion. And Dalvin Cook being know he's a stud so you lose your.
00:01:37.630 - 00:02:01.380, Speaker A: So that was a notable pick because the crowd was picking Minnesota to cover and it was only a one and a half point spread. So that's basically picking them to win. But Chewy saw through that and picked Cleveland. Another one, the terrible Colts over terrible Miami. But you said this is the time for the Colts to shine and they absolutely did. So good call there as well. Even though Miami was favored by two.
00:02:02.550 - 00:02:12.278, Speaker B: Yeah. Colts defense needed to step up. They did. Their defense is just, they have too much talent on that side of the ball and the Miami offensive line is just awful bad.
00:02:12.364 - 00:02:32.622, Speaker A: And getting worse. Green Bay over Pittsburgh. The crowd had 90% of its, you know, of the money. Like there was a really big crowd sort of prediction on the Vegas markets, on the Steelers. But you picked Green Bay to cover. I believe that was so that was a great pick. Yeah, the spread was six and a half.
00:02:32.622 - 00:02:35.694, Speaker A: You picked them to cover and they definitely did that.
00:02:35.732 - 00:02:49.140, Speaker B: What happened there again, same thing. Pittsburgh might actually have the worst offensive line in the know. And Ben Roethlisberger injury. Their stud wide receivers banged up. Yeah.
00:02:49.670 - 00:03:05.654, Speaker A: So nice calls, nice predictions. And these are things that for Pittsburgh at least, you've been calling since week one. I remember. So a lot of credit due there, but I'm going to bring up some bad calls as well. Chewy, this time I'm holding your feet to the fire. Anytime you sided with me, you lost. Any time.
00:03:05.654 - 00:03:21.022, Speaker A: You agreed with my assessment. So that's a little bit of bad call there. You want to stick with the data. Not with Andy on these. Know Georgia. I said, Arkansas can't be that bad. Georgia can't be that good.
00:03:21.022 - 00:03:30.718, Speaker A: And Georgia proved themselves. They are one of the only teams in college football. They're a professional team. They look fantastic. They stomp Arkansas. What a game.
00:03:30.884 - 00:03:38.174, Speaker B: Yeah. To my defense, I will stay away from college football, stick with the NFL.
00:03:38.222 - 00:04:00.102, Speaker A: And stay away from me. I also need to stop picking games with teams from the state of Michigan. I just saw interesting stuff for they. They got the over. I had picked the under for Michigan State. They ended up blowing out, kind of blowing out western Kentucky. I thought western Kentucky would keep it closer and the Lions we thought would do a little better than they did.
00:04:00.102 - 00:04:13.366, Speaker A: But no, they were all unable to. So I'm just not touching the state of Michigan anymore. I'm done with it. Bye. You're done, Michigan. Sorry, Mitten State. I'm going to wave bye to you with the Mitten Auger used sports data IO via Chainlink to settle those prediction markets.
00:04:13.366 - 00:04:32.738, Speaker A: And coming up, we've got new set of games, markets and ODs to look at for this coming week. It's the week. Five games in the NFL. There's a bunch of really interesting games here. I'm going to start off with the headliner because to me the headliner is the Bills at Kansas City. Two killer teams. The Bills are rolling right now.
00:04:32.738 - 00:04:45.640, Speaker A: Kansas City has had some troubles, but they got it together last week. The spread is Kansas City is favored at two and a half at least when I saw an over under was 56 and a half. Chewy, what are you seeing? What are you thinking on this?
00:04:46.410 - 00:05:07.918, Speaker B: Kansas City favored by two and a half, all offshore books and sports books, they're showing 69% favored on the Chiefs. Auger right now is a little different. Line came out three and a half and 57% is taken. Buffalo. And the discrepancy actually is because of that line, that extra point right there.
00:05:08.084 - 00:05:15.460, Speaker A: That's really interesting. So wisdom of the crowd on Auger is giving more points to Kansas City. Is that right?
00:05:15.990 - 00:05:22.626, Speaker B: Yeah. Buffalo plus three and a half. And that's where the betting's been leaning so far.
00:05:22.728 - 00:05:28.242, Speaker A: Okay, so the Auger is leaning Kansas City, but even more than the other books.
00:05:28.386 - 00:05:29.986, Speaker B: No, they're leaning bills.
00:05:30.098 - 00:05:31.926, Speaker A: Oh, leaning bills. Okay, cool.
00:05:32.028 - 00:05:34.342, Speaker B: They're getting that extra point I got.
00:05:34.476 - 00:05:43.580, Speaker A: Oh, interesting there. All right, cool. So that's a really interesting one to compare. We're going to see where that goes. Where do I side here, Chewie? I don't know what to do. What are you seeing?
00:05:47.230 - 00:06:01.920, Speaker B: I'm probably taking the other part of this bet where over under 56 and a half. Olga seeing it pretty split. The sports books are leaning over and I too am probably leaning the over on this one.
00:06:03.890 - 00:06:17.558, Speaker A: The way the bills have been scoring, they've got, as you like to say, a lot of weapons. They're going to get 30 points. Kansas City as well. Right. This could be a really high scoring game. I like that pick as well. Yeah.
00:06:17.644 - 00:06:27.430, Speaker B: Chiefs defense is atrocious. Buffalo actually has a great defense, but I still see Kansas City putting up pretty close to 30. They've been averaging 30 for a game.
00:06:27.580 - 00:06:51.710, Speaker A: Looking forward to that game. Two early favorites for Super bowl contenders, so we'll like to see how that one plays out. Next game I got is San Francisco at Arizona? Is Arizona as good as they seem? They seem really great and they keep winning. Arizona is favored by five over under at 49 and a half. What are you seeing here, chewy?
00:06:54.630 - 00:07:10.840, Speaker B: The over is being bet heavily, 49 and a half. I would take that as well. Kind of agree with that. I think they just have so many weapons. I know DeAndre Hopkins still a little banged up, but Kyler Murray has been awesome.
00:07:11.370 - 00:07:13.110, Speaker A: Can San Francisco score?
00:07:14.090 - 00:07:26.522, Speaker B: Yeah, they've actually been putting up points. Devo Samuel, he's a monster. I know they're banged up at running back, but their coaching is too good. They can still put up some points.
00:07:26.656 - 00:07:43.226, Speaker A: All right, cool. I'm going to pick Arizona to win this one. I don't know about the spread, but they just look too good. I don't know if they're going to have an undefeated season but they just look like they've got a lot of wins in front of them. Don't see them losing anytime soon, just from my view. Of course. Take that with a grain of salt.
00:07:43.226 - 00:07:44.782, Speaker A: You saw how well I did last week.
00:07:44.836 - 00:07:49.586, Speaker B: Well, so Vegas is leaning San Fran plus getting those five and a half points.
00:07:49.768 - 00:07:50.930, Speaker A: Oh, that's interesting.
00:07:51.080 - 00:07:51.780, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:52.630 - 00:08:06.210, Speaker A: All right, I'm going to take note of that. We're going to compare. I like breaking these down and seeing how Vegas does compared to you. Compared to Auger. We don't even need to throw me in this equation. I'm bad enough. The Colts, who came back and turned it around at Baltimore.
00:08:06.210 - 00:08:19.500, Speaker A: Baltimore was favored by seven points with the over under at 47. The Colts aren't necessarily that exciting, but Baltimore has really been putting on a show lately. They've kind of gotten the wheels back on, doing very well. So what do you think about this?
00:08:20.830 - 00:08:39.860, Speaker B: 84% is actually bet on the Colts. It's a lot of points. Colts are just banged up and I'm leaning Baltimore if I had to choose, going to my head, I'm leaning Baltimore in this.
00:08:42.390 - 00:08:59.026, Speaker A: You. So Colts have a good defense. Baltimore's running a lot, which can stop it. But, man, Baltimore feels like they got things right to me as well. So I like this. It is a big line, too. So maybe that's just why people are a big spread.
00:08:59.026 - 00:09:06.298, Speaker A: A lot of points, but still, I think that's a touchdown. It's not that much. Win by ten points. That's not too bad.
00:09:06.384 - 00:09:15.290, Speaker B: So if you get the line at six and a half, I take Baltimore. If you're getting the line at seven and a half, I go, I lean the Colts.
00:09:15.370 - 00:09:35.442, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Cool. So keep an eye on your books and see how those lines change. Although it's Thursday now, when we're recording, it's Friday, we'll be a little bit of change. There still might be some change over the weekend. Cleveland Browns at the Chargers. Chargers are favored by one and a half with an over under at 46 and a half.
00:09:35.442 - 00:09:39.960, Speaker A: These over unders are getting progressively lower just as I go through the games. I don't know why.
00:09:41.530 - 00:09:52.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is actually one of my favorite bets of the week, taking the over on this one. Chargers have looked awesome the last two games.
00:09:55.070 - 00:10:11.710, Speaker A: Yeah, really coming through. But you're not really ready to pick a winner. You've liked Cleveland a lot. We just talked about at the top of the show now the Chargers. This one's kind of a coin toss game. Looks like the spread is picking the home team, basically. Yeah.
00:10:11.780 - 00:10:24.942, Speaker B: Public on sportsbooks are 57% leaning on Cleveland. With that point and a half. On Auger, it's slightly lower, 53% leaning on the Chargers. So a little bit of, little bit of a flip there.
00:10:25.096 - 00:10:46.182, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if crowd doesn't know much from that data. That's not statistically significant in my mind. But really interesting on the under over there. Your New York Giants at Dallas. Dallas has been rolling and playing really well as well. Dallas favored by seven over under at 52 and a half. Wait, the Giants won last week in overtime.
00:10:46.182 - 00:10:55.390, Speaker A: Sequan comes through at the end there and takes over. So finally his nft luck followed through. But can they do it again with Dallas?
00:10:56.130 - 00:11:13.300, Speaker B: Yeah, my boy won me fantasy last week, so that was, you know, normally I'd say Dallas should destroy the Giants. This is pretty heated rivalry, so I'm actually going to take the Giants to cover the seven and a half points.
00:11:14.070 - 00:11:21.126, Speaker A: This sounds like a heart instead of a head just where you're coming from. But hey, once in a while you take one. Right?
00:11:21.308 - 00:11:25.346, Speaker B: Let's see, 89% is also leaning on the Giants.
00:11:25.458 - 00:11:48.426, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. All right, cool. Well, we'll see if the crowd knows what they're doing on that one. Miami at Tampa Bay, I went through and I just kind of picked the leading teams and did them in order. So Tampa Bay has been playing well as well. Tampa Bay with a favored by ten over under 48. A little low, but it's at Tampa Bay.
00:11:48.426 - 00:11:50.430, Speaker A: I mean, Tampa Bay will clearly roll.
00:11:51.090 - 00:12:15.682, Speaker B: But ten, I know a lot of points. Yeah. If you get that line at ten and a half, I don't know if I'm taking that game over under. Yeah, I think they should cover this. Let's see. Tampa, I expect to be running all over Miami. Miami actually has one of the better defenses, first receivers.
00:12:15.682 - 00:12:18.310, Speaker B: They've been atrocious first running backs.
00:12:20.490 - 00:12:30.266, Speaker A: So a lot of runs, potentially some points, but ten is a little bit of a ten and a half. Definitely not a good number ten. It's reasonable. So we'll see. Yeah.
00:12:30.288 - 00:12:34.410, Speaker B: The only thing, knowing Tampa's offense, they're still going to be passing the ball.
00:12:34.490 - 00:12:48.820, Speaker A: Yeah. Denver, who has also been playing very well at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh favored by one point over under is 40. I think this is the low over under of the week. Really low scoring game is expected. What do you see here?
00:12:49.270 - 00:13:11.242, Speaker B: So Denver's starting quarterback got a concussion last week. I haven't looked at his injury update, so I'm not sure if he's back. Looking at that line, it looks like he's not going to be back. Ben Roethlisberger is banged up, too. Yeah. Just two injured teams right now. I'd probably lean Denver, though.
00:13:11.242 - 00:13:13.414, Speaker B: I'm not a big believer in Pittsburgh.
00:13:13.542 - 00:13:30.750, Speaker A: Yeah, Denver's been playing very even. You know, defense can definitely hold Steelers to over. I like this total points. Maybe the under. That's kind of my instinct if nobody's going to be scoring, going to be a boring game to watch.
00:13:30.820 - 00:13:31.998, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I think, too.
00:13:32.084 - 00:13:38.100, Speaker A: All right. Green Bay favored by three at Cincinnati over under a 51.
00:13:38.550 - 00:13:44.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I love the over on this. I mean, I just think they're going to keep putting up points both ways.
00:13:45.670 - 00:13:52.054, Speaker A: High scoring teams and a lot of fun to watch. It sounds like hopefully it's a primetime game. We can catch that.
00:13:52.172 - 00:13:52.840, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:54.810 - 00:13:57.240, Speaker A: What's good about Cincinnati? I don't know as much about them.
00:13:58.730 - 00:14:19.386, Speaker B: Their defense has actually been much better this year than last season. Nothing to write home about. Not top ten in my opinion, but much better. Their offense has a ton of weapons. They're getting t. Higgins back. Only issue is Joe Mixon, really good running back, is actually going to most likely be out with ankle injury.
00:14:19.386 - 00:14:31.262, Speaker B: He was working on the side riding the bike yesterday. I don't think he's actually going to be ready this week. But they have Tyler Boyd's a stud. Jamar Chase, who they first round draft pick in the draft.
00:14:31.326 - 00:14:31.554, Speaker A: Stud.
00:14:31.592 - 00:14:34.638, Speaker B: T. Higgins stud. Yeah, they're pretty good at wide receiver.
00:14:34.734 - 00:14:50.300, Speaker A: Awesome. We've got the La Rams, who've been playing well, favored by two and a half at Seattle. The over under here is 54 and a half, which is again a pretty high set of points there. What do you see in this game.
00:14:50.910 - 00:14:56.620, Speaker B: Again, I'm leaning over in this one. Both these teams can put up points.
00:14:58.590 - 00:15:04.160, Speaker A: This looked like a really fun one, too. I was thinking over as well, just because of.
00:15:05.250 - 00:15:06.330, Speaker B: We're doomed.
00:15:06.490 - 00:15:37.400, Speaker A: Yeah, I know you're picking with me or you said first and I said I'm picking with. So I'm starting to lean your way a little bit more here and there. But I got my eye on a few of these things and that did seem like one where there could be a lot of points. Matthew Stafford's just throwing the ball incredibly well for the Rams, so they're going to be able to score for sure. The Lions at Minnesota. Minnesota has been playing well, favored by nine over under of 49. I'm not touching this because it's got a team from Michigan, but what do you see here?
00:15:39.310 - 00:15:54.046, Speaker B: Again, this comes down to Dalvin Cook. He tried to play last week was rather ineffective. He's dealing with ankle injury again. I'm staying away from that spread and I take anything. I'm probably leaning the over on this one too.
00:15:54.148 - 00:16:11.650, Speaker A: Just stick with me and avoid teams from Michigan. They're cursing me and maybe you by. Um, all right. Those are a good look at some of those top games. At least know sort of the leading teams. Any other games or points that you've got a particular eye on or the Augers noticed?
00:16:15.190 - 00:16:25.926, Speaker B: Yeah, New Orleans, Washington. Okay. Over under on that I think was 44 and a half and seeing 84% bet on the over. And I'm probably leaning that as well.
00:16:25.948 - 00:16:36.954, Speaker A: On this one for New Orleans and Washington on the over. So you're expecting good Jamis to be.
00:16:36.992 - 00:16:40.726, Speaker B: Back, average James to be back, average.
00:16:40.758 - 00:16:48.880, Speaker A: James to be back. 44 is a bit low, so we'll keep an eye on that one as well. Awesome. Anything else?
00:16:49.890 - 00:16:55.490, Speaker B: No, the other one was the Cincinnati one, which I liked. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
00:16:55.560 - 00:17:12.434, Speaker A: Awesome. I've got some college games. I don't know if I'm going to do picks here, but some college games that are really interesting this week. Oklahoma at Texas. Classic rivalry game. A huge rivalry game. Oklahoma playing very well, favored by three and a half at Texas.
00:17:12.434 - 00:17:37.998, Speaker A: Over under here, 63.5. That's a massive amount of points. So you said you're staying away from this. So here's some interesting things I like about this game. Because it's a rivalry game, there will be some hype and these players will be ready to play. I actually like the under for this because I think that defenses can come and play harder. And 63 and a half is a tremendous amount of points, even for the big twelve.
00:17:37.998 - 00:18:01.160, Speaker A: I don't think these are the same teams in the big twelve that people remember from 10, 15, 20 years ago where it was like 70 to 60. It was like these insane big games. They're different teams and they do play spread and they do play high passing offenses, but there's a lot more cover two and people are playing to stop it and it just slows the game down a little bit. So I think this over is a little bit high for me.
00:18:01.690 - 00:18:24.198, Speaker B: Yeah. Oklahoma hasn't been playing a normal Lincoln Riley offense that we're used to. That offense just doesn't stay down for long. And Texas has given up 6.1 yards per play on the season. Overall, 34 points per game. It's right around there.
00:18:24.198 - 00:18:28.590, Speaker B: I could see 60 points put up. I could see 66 points put up.
00:18:28.660 - 00:18:49.540, Speaker A: Yeah, I see it. I like the defenses coming for the rivalry game. That's my story based, not data based. Pick other interesting game. Penn State at Iowa, two top five teams. I think Iowa is number three and Penn State's five and eight people. Iowa favored by one and a half points over under 41.
00:18:49.540 - 00:19:08.860, Speaker A: I like the over for this for the same reason. I don't think this is the big ten that people remember from the past. People are thinking this is going to be a nine to six game. I don't think so. These are two teams that can score and have scored and will be able to put up points. I think it'll be a great battle and find out really what's going on in the Big Ten.
00:19:09.550 - 00:19:26.020, Speaker B: I'm looking for this game. The total to be right around that 43 number. Both teams, they're averaging less than four yards per carry. Both run defenses are really good. To me. It's going to come down who handles third down the best.
00:19:28.150 - 00:19:53.340, Speaker A: And then of course Iowa is going to have that home crowd hyped up for this as good as they've had in years and years. So a fantastic looking game. Georgia at Auburn is the other game that's interesting to me just because I picked against Georgia last week. Georgia with 15 and a half points over Auburn over under at 47. I think I'm going with Georgia just because I want to redeem myself and believe in something.
00:19:53.870 - 00:20:12.590, Speaker B: So this game is actually really interesting. This line opened at ten. It's all the way up to 15 and a half. That's a huge betting world. Also, the over under opened at 44 and a half and it's up to 46 and a half. But I'm going to go with you on this one. I just think Georgia is too good.
00:20:12.590 - 00:20:17.346, Speaker B: I'm going to take Georgia even with the juiced up line at 15 and a half, but I'm going to go.
00:20:17.368 - 00:20:25.300, Speaker A: With the under in this one under. You like the under crowd taking anything on this? Is there any action on there yet?
00:20:26.010 - 00:20:27.910, Speaker B: I actually have not checked.
00:20:29.610 - 00:20:31.878, Speaker A: We'll take a minute. We'll check. We got time.
00:20:31.964 - 00:20:41.382, Speaker B: Yeah, it looks the crowd is leaning. They're leaning. Georgia and the under as.
00:20:41.516 - 00:21:08.114, Speaker A: All right, well, we'll see if Auburn can pull something off. I don't know anything about Auburn this year, but I know enough about Georgia now. I've learned that lesson. Week five and I guess it was week six and a half for the NCAA. This time of year is really interesting to me. All of these games you've got some injuries, you've got people settling into their new schemes. Like if they're on a new team.
00:21:08.114 - 00:21:31.946, Speaker A: You've got coaches really hitting the rhythm of that weekly practice, and you start to see who teams really are in college. You start to get a lot more division games where they're playing for a title. So things start to matter a little bit more. The weather turns cool. There's literally leaves falling in front of my window right now. This is the time of year for football for me. So I'm really excited to see this week kind of going forward.
00:21:32.128 - 00:21:35.180, Speaker B: Hey, I am totally shocked you did not bring up our.
00:21:38.670 - 00:21:46.382, Speaker A: So, uh, I'm a Michigan state guy and you're a Rutgers guy. We got a little head to head action. It's at Rutgers. I have not seen the line on this.
00:21:46.436 - 00:21:47.294, Speaker B: Five and a half.
00:21:47.412 - 00:21:50.958, Speaker A: Five and a half. And I'm assuming Michigan State has it.
00:21:51.124 - 00:21:53.486, Speaker B: Yes. Michigan State's favorite by five and a half.
00:21:53.588 - 00:21:58.818, Speaker A: Well, I say I don't want to touch any teams for Michigan. That's why I don't want to jinx myself.
00:21:58.984 - 00:22:05.074, Speaker B: I was actually surprised it was that low after Ohio State's abuse of Rutgers last week.
00:22:05.192 - 00:22:06.950, Speaker A: You guys got banged up, too, right?
00:22:07.100 - 00:22:07.794, Speaker B: Awful.
00:22:07.922 - 00:22:45.006, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, this is the only reason I have any confidence in Michigan state for this game, because Michigan State is still kind of this unknown entity, even to themselves, even to its fan base. So two weeks ago, Michigan State played Nebraska, scored, you know, got like, five yards total in the second half or something ridiculous. Last week against Western Kentucky, 42 points in the first half, six points in the second half with two field goals. Had a really hard time on that second half. So what team is this? Is my question. It's not a super great, necessarily a championship team.
00:22:45.006 - 00:22:59.814, Speaker A: I'm looking for a bowl. I'm really happy with that. But going into records, you guys have been playing really well. You held Michigan tight. Right. You've been hanging really well with teams and playing super aggressive, too. It was like a fake punt on the first possession against Ohio State.
00:22:59.814 - 00:23:10.630, Speaker A: Maybe that doesn't work against Ohio State, but stuff like that can work against a team who's feeling cocky after a first five and season in a little while. So I'm super nervous about this game as a fan.
00:23:11.450 - 00:23:15.930, Speaker B: Yeah. So you know who we're going with. Got to stick with the team.
00:23:16.000 - 00:23:34.222, Speaker A: Got to stick with the team. Five and a half. Yeah. I think Michigan State will run over them by 21, and that's the scoreboard for the week. Don't stick with me. I don't know how to pick these. Anything else you want to cover this week before I bail? With a desperate homer pick.
00:23:34.356 - 00:23:38.338, Speaker B: No, I wanted to end with Rutgers. We're good.
00:23:38.504 - 00:23:57.366, Speaker A: All right. Well, good luck to know. When it comes down to it, I just love football and that's fun to hang out and chat with you.
