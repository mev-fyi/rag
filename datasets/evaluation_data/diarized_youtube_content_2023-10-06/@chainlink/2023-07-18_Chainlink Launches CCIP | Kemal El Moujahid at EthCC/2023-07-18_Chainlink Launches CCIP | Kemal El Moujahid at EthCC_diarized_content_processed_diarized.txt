00:00:05.290 - 00:00:36.086, Speaker A: All right, well, look, I feel so privileged to be here today and drop such a huge announcement. Series of announcements, actually. And this will really mark a new chapter for Web three. So, as we all know, we live in an increasingly multichain world. More private chains, more public chains. And the problem is that those chains don't talk with each other. And that creates a series of much bigger problems.
00:00:36.086 - 00:01:13.538, Speaker A: The first one is that liquidity is fragmented. So trading across chains is painful. Using collateral in one chain to borrow in another chain is painful. Governance is painful, and users have to jump through some crazy hoops to circumvent this problem. Second, this is much, much bigger than DFI. They're close to $900 trillion of assets just waiting to be tokenized. And there's a huge need for this huge pressure to do this.
00:01:13.538 - 00:01:24.774, Speaker A: And the big bottleneck is cross chain communication. If you think about it, why would you put an asset on chain for this asset to be trapped on one chain instead of being able to move.
00:01:24.812 - 00:01:28.250, Speaker B: Freely across chains right now, think about.
00:01:28.320 - 00:01:37.114, Speaker A: Just a few percent of this 900 trillion dollar value amount number flowing into web three and the impact this would.
00:01:37.152 - 00:01:38.330, Speaker B: Have on the industry.
00:01:39.470 - 00:02:02.910, Speaker A: And third, the lack of interoperability is just killing innovation. You can't mix and match contracts. You can't compose contracts. I think there's someone on Twitter said that blockchains without cross chain communication is like computers with no Internet. And I think it's very true. This is how web two works. Developers.
00:02:02.910 - 00:02:19.194, Speaker A: Someone creates something really great. Another developer who doesn't know them from Adam or Eve just goes and uses it, and then the whole ecosystem grows that way. We can't do this in web three, right? So this problem is holding us back. It's holding the whole industry back.
00:02:19.232 - 00:02:20.540, Speaker B: So how do we solve this?
00:02:20.910 - 00:02:46.174, Speaker A: Well, the first thing that we have to recognize, this is an extremely difficult problem to solve. It's very, very difficult. Technically, chains are all very different for all very good reasons. And then security is super important. Just last year, and even recently, we've seen some crazy numbers. I think there's. Last year, it was close to $2 billion worth of fund that were stolen.
00:02:46.222 - 00:02:50.098, Speaker B: So security is super important, which makes.
00:02:50.184 - 00:02:51.940, Speaker A: This product very hard to build.
00:02:52.310 - 00:02:54.238, Speaker B: But the second point is that it's.
00:02:54.254 - 00:03:10.780, Speaker A: Not just a product. What we need to create is a standard. Think about it. It's like a language, like TCP Ip. Everyone needs to adopt it. For this to be valuable, everyone needs to speak the same language, and that's what we need to create a standard.
00:03:11.950 - 00:03:13.660, Speaker B: So how do you build a standard.
00:03:14.350 - 00:03:21.900, Speaker A: Well, first it needs to be secure. This goes without saying, going to keep repeating a lot of secure, secure. It's very important.
00:03:22.750 - 00:03:25.038, Speaker B: It needs to be flexible and then.
00:03:25.044 - 00:03:28.878, Speaker A: It needs to have community security because the name of the game you're going.
00:03:28.884 - 00:03:35.666, Speaker B: To move assets across chains has to be highly, highly reliable, flexible, because we.
00:03:35.688 - 00:03:55.720, Speaker A: Need to accommodate all the different use cases that developers are going to come up with. It needs to be able to accommodate all these ideas that the standard is going to have to welcome. Right. And the third one is community, because the standard is only as valuable as the community that uses it, that adopts it.
00:03:56.250 - 00:03:58.954, Speaker B: It turns out chain link, and thanks.
00:03:58.992 - 00:04:05.162, Speaker A: To our users and our partners, has created the industry defining standard for data.
00:04:05.216 - 00:04:08.860, Speaker B: In web three and has built an incredible community.
00:04:09.390 - 00:04:16.006, Speaker A: This is why Chainlink is uniquely positioned to solve this crosschain problem by extending.
00:04:16.038 - 00:04:19.998, Speaker B: This standard to crosschain and unlock a.
00:04:20.004 - 00:04:20.954, Speaker A: New wave of innovation.
00:04:21.002 - 00:04:21.454, Speaker B: Web three.
00:04:21.492 - 00:04:26.254, Speaker A: And so no wonder that this moment has been so highly anticipated.
00:04:26.382 - 00:04:30.206, Speaker B: And so it is my absolute pleasure.
00:04:30.318 - 00:05:15.694, Speaker A: To announce that the wait is over. CCIP is launching right now on Mainnet, early access for Synthetix and Aave. And all developers are going to be able to use CCIP on testnet in three small days on five different testnets. So we're building CCIP with security first. We take no shortcuts here. We have a defense in depth strategy. We're using the same time tested node operators and infrastructure that have secured our data business.
00:05:15.694 - 00:05:42.486, Speaker A: And security is really what will create the standard. And then the standard is what's going to unlock this whole innovation. Now, it's also super flexible, as you will see. The docs will be available. Actually, I think they are available. And you'll see that we have many different layers that you could use. We have simplified token transfer, we have smart transaction execution for gas efficiency, and then it's very easy to integrate.
00:05:42.486 - 00:05:50.846, Speaker A: It's something that we spent a lot of time working on. And I want to thank again all our beta partners who have given us so much feedback on how to make.
00:05:50.868 - 00:05:56.302, Speaker B: This product what it is. And as I mentioned, well, Chainlink already.
00:05:56.356 - 00:06:22.630, Speaker A: Built a web three standard, thanks to all of you, with $8 trillion worth of transaction value enabled, with 9 billion data points delivered on chain, working with all major chains, all major Dapps, working with Swift, working with twelve of the biggest banks in the world. And what we want to do is we want to bring all this community to solve the cross chain problem altogether.
00:06:23.290 - 00:06:29.766, Speaker B: And because we're building chainlink as a platform, using one product makes it easier.
00:06:29.798 - 00:06:31.098, Speaker A: To use another product.
00:06:31.264 - 00:06:36.394, Speaker B: And this applies to CCIP. So if you're using data feeds well.
00:06:36.432 - 00:06:43.070, Speaker A: It makes it super easy for you to use CCIP because you're not introducing any additional trust assumption.
00:06:44.850 - 00:06:47.194, Speaker B: So we're excited to partner with synthetics.
00:06:47.242 - 00:07:19.994, Speaker A: And you'll hear from Kane right after this. The synthetilla porter is using CCIP to burn and mint tokens across chains safely and accurately. And this burn and mint method is actually way more capital efficient because it doesn't require liquidity pool. We're also working with ave to power cross chain governance. So the governance v two was expensive, and so the ave community voted to integrate CCIP to power governance v three. Since CCIP is more gas efficient and.
00:07:20.032 - 00:07:23.754, Speaker B: It'S flexible and secure and all the.
00:07:23.872 - 00:07:44.446, Speaker A: Many other things, all the wonderful and unexpected things that all of you developers are going to come up with with CCAP, this is really the moment that I think we unlock Web three interoperability. We want to unlock all of you in the whole ecosystem with this launch. And I know it took time to.
00:07:44.468 - 00:07:51.040, Speaker B: Build, but we wanted to build it right, and we wanted to build it with you.
00:07:51.650 - 00:08:13.240, Speaker A: And this is going to be a whole new chapter in web three. Sergey is going to talk about how this is enabling an Internet of contracts with a single connectivity standard, similarly to TCP IP, where you could just seamlessly reuse any components you want to build the best experience possible. So join us and let's build this standard together.
00:08:13.610 - 00:08:14.100, Speaker B: Thank you.
