00:00:09.210 - 00:00:37.574, Speaker A: Wow. Well, first, thank you all for being here to our first in person, smart con. It's absolutely incredible to have met so many of you here for the first time in real life. And that's why we actually put this together, because many of these colleagues of mine I've actually never met in real life. And so you can think of this panel as a proof of life. We exist. We are here.
00:00:37.574 - 00:01:12.894, Speaker A: Sometimes you may not see us all the time publicly speaking and at events, but that's because we're behind the scenes building. And at Chainlink, if you've been here and part of the community, you know that at Chainlink, we build and we get stuff done. So that's why you don't see us all the time. But we did want to give you a chance to meet the folks behind the scenes and get to know some of these amazing colleagues of mine. So with that, I would love to. Maybe if you guys can just introduce yourselves, your name, your title, so some folks who might not know you yet, and then we'll dive into future questions. So, Dahlia.
00:01:13.022 - 00:01:17.582, Speaker B: All right. Hi, everyone. I'm Dahlia Malki. I'm chief research officer.
00:01:17.646 - 00:01:19.720, Speaker A: I think this sounds a little low.
00:01:20.570 - 00:01:22.920, Speaker B: That's nothing I can do about it.
00:01:24.330 - 00:01:28.466, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Kamal, chief product officer at Chainlink Labs.
00:01:28.658 - 00:01:32.054, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Mike Jarrison, Coo at Chainlink Labs.
00:01:32.182 - 00:01:35.478, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Steve Ellis, chief technology officer at Chainlink Labs.
00:01:35.494 - 00:01:57.234, Speaker A: All right, well, you have their names, but I'd like to dive in a little bit more. Some of you have joined us recently in the last few months, and some of you have been here since the very beginning. So maybe we'll start with Steve, you've been here since the very beginning. Maybe tell a little bit about the founding story of Chainlink and how you got into web3 and came up with the idea.
00:01:57.352 - 00:02:21.162, Speaker E: Sure. Yeah. I think the idea of a distributed ledger was always very powerful to me once I started to grasp that beyond monetary purposes. I think common problem in history is that the winner gets to rewrite history. And so the idea that there's sort of this immutable record seemed extremely powerful. It's something that never existed. So was excited to dive into that.
00:02:21.162 - 00:02:59.522, Speaker E: And then pretty early on, we recognized that oracles were going to be extremely powerful, so we decided to focus on that. There was sort of first version. We were an oracle providing it, and it doesn't take too much feedback to recognize that in a distributed system, you want many different. If it's purely decentralized, why would you trust a centralized oracle. So we ran, then we had an open source implementation that anybody could run. But we pretty quickly saw the problem of, you don't want your counterparty to run an oracle because you don't necessarily trust them. You don't want yourself to necessarily run an oracle.
00:02:59.522 - 00:03:09.990, Speaker E: So we wanted to find how do you incentivize unbiased third party oracles to provide secure data? And that was how we landed on Chainlink.
00:03:10.150 - 00:03:13.340, Speaker A: And that was now six, seven years ago.
00:03:13.790 - 00:03:21.962, Speaker E: Chainlink 2017. But I think 2014 is when I officially started working with Sergey.
00:03:22.026 - 00:03:34.400, Speaker A: Very cool. Wow. And then in the last year and months, we've had a few other amazing new people join. Mike share you came from a decade plus at LinkedIn to join the space.
00:03:35.730 - 00:04:31.250, Speaker D: Yeah. So I've been here now almost about a year, and what happened about a year ago was I just got hooked on Web three, and I just had that light bulb moment that many of us in this room probably have, where you start to see, wow, this makes sense to have cryptographic guarantees, to have a more deterministic world than a probabilistic world. And I just felt like this was something that was just getting going in a really meaningful way. And also, for me, it was a bit of an interesting journey because I started my career back, believe it or not, the mid ninety s. I had an Internet company in Web one that was around data, and it was emerging markets data. And I remember at the time, in the late 90s, how lucky am I, this moment of the birth, really, of the Internet? And as I dug more and more into web3, like, wow, it's happening again. How lucky to have a second shot at it.
00:04:31.250 - 00:04:35.906, Speaker D: And then, of course, in the middle, I was in web two, where I was at LinkedIn for a decade.
00:04:36.018 - 00:04:44.230, Speaker A: We forgive you for the web two. And, Kamal, similarly, you were also from web two and to the side.
00:04:44.380 - 00:04:44.694, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:04:44.732 - 00:05:38.202, Speaker C: I think for me, the notion that you could build an app that can't be shut down, I think this notion is just so powerful. Like, if you believe in sort of the power of the builder and their power to change things and the fact that now builders can create things that can't be shut down, that's such a powerful idea. I've always sort of known that I was going to do something in the space. So I've been watching the space for quite some time, and I felt probably last year that things were really accelerating, that the community was coming together, that the building blocks were starting to be in place. And so I thought, okay, that's probably the moment to jump in. I think that I love working on transformative technologies. I had the privilege to lead the tensorflow team at Google.
00:05:38.202 - 00:05:55.280, Speaker C: Tensorflow is the number one machine learning framework in the world, and I feel that altogether, we could really provide so much change in the industry and society with, again, this premise of apps that can't be shut down and that are provably fair.
00:05:56.210 - 00:05:58.320, Speaker A: Cool. And you, Dahlia, too.
00:05:59.250 - 00:06:54.990, Speaker B: So, for me, it's sort of different. What I'm excited about now and what got me first now with slightly more insight, the main thing that excites me about the field is inclusion. Financial inclusion, inclusion of private sector allowing initiative and entrepreneurship, not just at the periphery of the financial system, but really deep down into the foundations and financial system I refer to as the more general what platforms allow. This is really what drives all of the use cases and applications on top of it. But this is an insight that I came to a little later in the process, I have to admit. So I started my interest in the field mostly in the technology. The technology was in the field of expertise that I was already in, and I thought it was fascinating.
00:06:54.990 - 00:07:04.930, Speaker B: And the thing that drew me the most was an article in 2017 by Marco dresen where he said bitcoin solved the byzantine general's problem.
00:07:05.080 - 00:07:06.082, Speaker A: I was like, what? Really?
00:07:06.136 - 00:07:34.602, Speaker B: That's interesting. I'm not sure bitcoin did. Let me look into this a little deeper. And together with other experts in the field, we did a lot of work to bring the technologies from the academic world and the rigorous foundations closer and bridge this understanding between what's happening technically in the web3 space compared with what academic and scientific community knew about.
00:07:34.736 - 00:07:53.730, Speaker A: Yeah, many of us all came from the web two space, but we found that web3 is where all the action is at, where the future is at where the inclusion and where we all wanted to be. But within web3, though, there's lots of different projects and protocols and things like that. So maybe starting from this side. Dahlia, how did you decide Chainlink?
00:07:56.490 - 00:08:42.946, Speaker B: Well, it's the only project that put me through a rigorous screening process. They might think really well of themselves if they're putting me through such a rigorous screening process. But going back to the technical side, I think that the real challenge for industry right now is beyond consensus. And I say this as a consensus expert. There's always going to be ways to improve layer one chains and do more performance throughput this that. But really, the challenge is to bridge between what blockchains cannot do. And let's face it, smart contracts as much as Kamal likes them are very limited in what they do.
00:08:42.946 - 00:09:11.142, Speaker B: Did you ever program in assembly language an 80 86, of course processor yesterday? Well that would have been a better experience than programming smart contracts today. So I think that the real challenge our industry faces is really beyond consensus, is bringing capabilities and bridges, cross chains and to the world and to the real world into smart contracts. And that's why Chainlink.
00:09:11.206 - 00:09:15.486, Speaker A: But really because of the interview process. No, it's really because of the interview process.
00:09:15.588 - 00:09:18.830, Speaker B: Yeah, they grilled me. No, totally.
00:09:19.170 - 00:09:20.846, Speaker A: And Kamal, what about you?
00:09:20.948 - 00:10:17.858, Speaker C: Yeah, so I agree I have not coded in assembly yesterday or nor for a long time, but I agree that I think right now the biggest hurdle I could see for massive adoption, I'm talking about like ten x 100 x 1000 x more developers and more application, is the ability to bridge all these different pieces together. Assets, smart contracts, web two data, web two resources and provide composability. I mean in web two this is really how ecosystem take off when you could take the best component to do something and you just know the API for that thing and just compose it. And I think chain link solves this problem. So that's first reason. Second reason is I love working on developer platforms. I think there's something magical about taking something that's very complex, very hard, and only some very smart people can figure out.
00:10:17.944 - 00:10:19.380, Speaker B: And you're looking at me.
00:10:21.670 - 00:10:24.478, Speaker C: And I'm looking this way as well, and I'm.
00:10:24.494 - 00:10:25.620, Speaker E: Looking at you too.
00:10:28.090 - 00:10:45.450, Speaker C: And just wrapping it up in an API, that's easy use. Some magical things happen because developer communities, they go do incredible things that you would never have imagined when you were actually designing this API. And that's magic. And I'm addicted to this. So that's why I joined.
00:10:46.110 - 00:11:21.622, Speaker D: Yeah, for me I'd say it was probably two things I'd say one is vision and two is variety. So the vision at Chainlink is essentially Chainlink Labs is to build a world powered by truth. And you think about how many things are not going well in the world, and a lot of it's due to disinformation, misinformation. And so this whole set of proving all of these things that happen in the real world is something very meaningful and something that I wanted to be a part to help shape. So that was probably the biggest thing I'd say. The second thing is I'm a generalist by nature. I just love variety of things.
00:11:21.622 - 00:11:39.770, Speaker D: And just where Chainlink's position, we help enable so many different applications. And so the conversations, the things to think through are very diverse. And wide, and I just love that. And so it's a very unique spot where we are in the landscape.
00:11:40.750 - 00:12:09.080, Speaker E: Steve, want to answer I think, a little bit more on what we're just. This is one of the biggest problems as a smart contract developer. When I started to get involved, how we saw Oracle problem as a problem is just that there's so many limitations and how do we help deliver blockchain and make it what everybody thinks. This was just a big missing piece of the system that we wanted to focus on and thought this is how we can make the most impact and help the whole ecosystem grow the most.
00:12:09.850 - 00:12:29.610, Speaker A: This question is a bit more for Maya Kamal Udalia, since you spent a long time at the large tech companies. Right. I'm really curious from more of an operator perspective, how has operating in this web3 space been different than operating back the large techs? Kamal.
00:12:31.890 - 00:13:37.518, Speaker C: I think the decentralized nature of things is both. Sometimes as an operator it's like surprising, but it's also exhilarating because really what you want to do with a community is unlock it, unleash it, enable it, or pick your fancy term, but really you want to just give them the tool and see them run with it. And I think the decentralized nature of things, you really have to just accept and let go and be like, you know, we're just going to put these things in and all those things are going to happen. So I think for me this has been one of the really interesting learnings and obviously I'm still learning and would love to meet all of you and learn from where your use case is and how we can work together. But I think this is really where the world's going. We're going from smaller team who are centralizing ideas or certain access or privilege to actually really decentralizing and providing. Getting back to your point of global accessibility.
00:13:37.518 - 00:13:54.470, Speaker C: Right. I think we're lucky also to work in an industry which North Star, again, another marketing term, sorry, but is providing banking services for the unbanked. It's really nice to know that this is something that we're all enabling.
00:13:55.450 - 00:14:42.754, Speaker D: Yeah, I think for me it's probably common for most startups, is just the sense of urgency is much different. Right. You're not living necessarily, of course, you have longer term strategies and visions, but most of your time is spent. Okay, how do we get something done quickly? I think we're all in this room. We all sense there's something we're all building here that's going to be historic and you don't want to waste those moments. And so what I've experienced at chain Lake Labs, which is just awesome, and I imagine many of your startups and your companies that are in this is a sense of urgency also. I'd say ownership, just in a smaller company, you tend to have more ownership where there's just a lot less layers, a lot less things going matrix.
00:14:42.754 - 00:14:51.740, Speaker D: And so you can actually get in there and actually start making things happen and moving quicker. So I've really enjoyed that part of it.
00:14:52.430 - 00:14:53.702, Speaker A: What about you, Dahlia?
00:14:53.766 - 00:15:50.794, Speaker B: Well, they kind of stole everything that I want to say, so let me just double click on size and speed. Before I joined Chainlink, I thought, looking at the technology that Chainlink has out there, that it must be a 10,000 people company, 10,000 engineering company, not counting overhead like me and the guys here, it's just staggering to see how much a small team like the one we have at Chainlink, but there are also all the other ecosystem and community projects out there. It's just staggering to see how quickly and how much we achieve even looking at this event. I've experienced such events at previous companies that I worked with in Microsoft. This is a phenomenal achievement. Look at this community. Look at how many interesting presentations there are.
00:15:50.794 - 00:15:57.680, Speaker B: Just look at the size of this event. Would you have imagined that a couple of hundred of engineers have brought this to happen?
00:15:59.570 - 00:16:14.930, Speaker A: And you guys all do have tons of experience from web two? What kind of advice would you give, actually, for people now building in web3? What can we learn from you guys from that experience to help us make Web three move forward faster?
00:16:18.010 - 00:16:22.210, Speaker B: Document. Start with a design document.
00:16:22.290 - 00:16:23.510, Speaker A: Write it really well.
00:16:23.580 - 00:16:35.900, Speaker B: It doesn't have to be 20 pages. It could be a one pager document. Write it, share it with your team, go through some internal review, auditing, discuss it, maybe present it before you rush and build?
00:16:38.110 - 00:17:24.310, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say I'm going to answer your question in a slightly different way. I think we've been talking a lot about how do you start with smart contracts and how do you augment them. And I think the next evolution is going to be thinking about a web3 app more generally, and thinking that, okay, some piece of it, it's okay for it to be sitting on a server because it's more efficient at doing something, or it's accessing some kind of data that's not on chain yet. And some pieces absolutely need to be on chain, and on chain A, then on chain B. And I think this idea of composability is going to be even more important. And we're seeing this in all the modern web3 apps. Right.
00:17:24.310 - 00:18:09.750, Speaker C: And obviously we're building the services to help you connect it all. And maybe that's even more important to have a design, an architecture in mind when you do that. So for me, I think I'm both very excited to have seen all the birth and all this activity around exploring all these different directions. But now I feel that the next evolution is to start thinking of a holistic web3 app and think of trust, minimization and decentralization as a spectrum, that it's okay to start on a certain place on the spectrum and then go increasingly more decentralized as chains get more capabilities.
00:18:11.210 - 00:18:41.522, Speaker D: Yeah, I love that we've talked about that, about the spectrum, and I think that's absolutely right. You're going to have a lot of these hybrids where they have some components that are trust minimized. I think one of the things we can learn from web two is scale. Some of obviously the largest, most well known tech companies have scaled massively. And actually it's a balance because I was just talking a few minutes ago about the sense of urgency, right. That you need. But if you're urgent and just constantly putting out fires, you're also going to go in circles, right.
00:18:41.522 - 00:19:00.950, Speaker D: So there's this tug that at certain moments you actually have to slow down and go, okay, wait a minute, where is this going to net out? But you can't do too much of that or you're going to miss your moment. So I think finding that right balance is most critical to operate and then eventually get to scale.
00:19:01.110 - 00:19:47.414, Speaker E: Yeah, I like the point about slowing down. I mean, we definitely move quickly, but sometimes security is a big problem in the space. And so a thing that I saw more often before, but we're changing is people don't always go through writing tests. I think there's a rush to get out there, and obviously there's more and more hacks, more and more stuff like that. And so I think we need to really focus on security, because if we want this to be sort of the long term, people treat it like a sprint, it's more of a marathon. And we really need to invest in the long term in terms of tests, security, because there's a lot of excitement and it's hard, I think, to incentivize that. It's a little bit on the community to push back if you don't see good practices there.
00:19:47.414 - 00:19:49.430, Speaker E: So I'd recommend trying to do that.
00:19:49.580 - 00:20:18.194, Speaker A: It's not easy right here. We're trying to move really fast, because the space is moving fast. It's like if you take a week long vacation, you come back and there's like 50 new protocols and the world's change web3. Just every day is different, but at the same time it's immutable. So we can't just push. If you make a mistake, there's a hack and then your whole protocol can go kerplunk. And so I think that's one of the challenges that we here have to work and operate under.
00:20:18.194 - 00:20:28.710, Speaker A: It's like, how do we move fast and scale, but at the same time, make sure that products that we put out there can be reliable and secure and trusted by all of our users?
00:20:29.290 - 00:20:31.110, Speaker C: Move fast and secure things.
00:20:31.260 - 00:20:32.200, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:20:32.810 - 00:20:34.822, Speaker D: Not move fast, not break things.
00:20:34.956 - 00:20:52.880, Speaker A: No break in. Yeah. We're building mission critical things. Right. If your like button doesn't work, it's fine. But if something goes down here, it's your billions of dollars of assets under total value, locked and secured, that can all go down.
00:20:53.330 - 00:20:54.606, Speaker D: No back button.
00:20:54.788 - 00:21:11.300, Speaker A: Exactly. No backplay. And then, so we mentioned, a few of you mentioned about, hey, what this industry needs. I'm curious to maybe dive in a bit more like Dali. What else do you think the industry needs to move forward to get to the promised land that we all here see.
00:21:14.550 - 00:21:16.980, Speaker B: I presented earlier today.
00:21:18.010 - 00:21:21.320, Speaker C: I think I know what you're going to say. Go ahead.
00:21:22.650 - 00:21:25.410, Speaker A: We work so close together, we can read each other's minds.
00:21:25.490 - 00:21:27.480, Speaker B: Shall we say one word each, then?
00:21:27.850 - 00:21:29.398, Speaker C: No, go ahead. Sorry.
00:21:29.564 - 00:21:30.534, Speaker D: Yeah, let's try that.
00:21:30.572 - 00:21:36.490, Speaker C: Let's see how it goes. Let's try to guess what the other person is going to say. I think the guy's going to say, deco.
00:21:37.870 - 00:22:45.970, Speaker B: Yeah, we need Deco. No, I really think that as a community, one of the biggest problems that we still need to solve is the privacy preserving identity problem. Without, and I would expand even more privacy preserving privacy enhancing identity, but also bridging to compliance, to regulation and to the web two world. And the reason is no financial platform, no financial foundations can really scale and reach massive use and adoption without solving this problem. And until we solve this problem, we will be this esoteric industry, which is extremely exciting. But it's exciting to what, 50 million people who really take their chances or take the risks or think that they know what they're doing. We have to address this problem.
00:22:45.970 - 00:23:09.850, Speaker B: We have to be able to bring, I don't know, your aunt or your neighbor or your grandmother. We have to be able to bring them to enjoy the benefits of this technology and to bring everybody along with us to the ride. In order to do that, we have to solve the financial identity and credentials problem without compromising privacy.
00:23:11.230 - 00:23:15.850, Speaker A: Yeah. Don't want everyone knowing what purchasing.
00:23:16.350 - 00:23:20.358, Speaker C: Yeah, okay. That's right.
00:23:20.464 - 00:23:21.120, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:22.130 - 00:23:26.990, Speaker C: No, I agree. I think this is one of the big problems to solve.
00:23:27.810 - 00:23:32.750, Speaker B: Can I guess what you're going to go ahead? Usability.
00:23:33.430 - 00:24:08.780, Speaker C: Usability is a good guess. Okay, I'm going to go with usability then things have to be usable. I was actually going to go back to the connectivity piece. I think we need to. As we're thinking of designing those web3 apps, we really have to make sure that when you're thinking, okay, I have this bit on web two and I have this bit on this chain and this bit on this other chain that the connectivity piece is really working well and that the API for the developer is really usable. So you did guess.
00:24:14.430 - 00:24:20.126, Speaker B: Wait, how come nobody's. What is Mike about to say?
00:24:20.148 - 00:24:21.166, Speaker E: Oh, what's Mike going to say?
00:24:21.188 - 00:24:22.000, Speaker D: You're going to guess.
00:24:24.050 - 00:24:24.910, Speaker E: Bridges.
00:24:27.730 - 00:24:47.366, Speaker D: Close, actually. All right, I'll go with bridges. No, I just am excited, like many of us here for use cases that just hit the masses. Right. So where this just becomes something that most of us in the world start to use. So I'm inspired by. I don't know if you heard the talk of with lemonade, for example.
00:24:47.366 - 00:25:29.320, Speaker D: That's a use case. I think they had billions of farmers, many of them subsistenance farmers. How do you get them? Crop insurance and blockchain is a great way to do that because the way you can do that through reducing cost now makes it possible. And is that one going to hit? Hopefully, but we'll see. There's a lot of shots on goal now. And who knows? Maybe it's like a silly app that just captures the world. Maybe it's a game, but I'm just excited when family members, friends aren't asking all these questions are actually in there now and users and part of adopting web3.
00:25:29.320 - 00:25:32.818, Speaker D: So I guess this is the term where I have to guess what Steve's.
00:25:32.834 - 00:25:33.800, Speaker B: Going to talk about.
00:25:34.810 - 00:25:38.280, Speaker D: Well, since I didn't take bridges. Security.
00:25:38.890 - 00:26:05.486, Speaker E: Yeah, pretty much. I feel like better developer tooling. We build a lot of it, but there's even some that we rely on. So there's things like fuzzers, lots of different tools that make it easier and more accessible for the builders out there to get out and build other products securely. So I think there's a lot of space left for that and it's still in its infancy. And so I really think in general, we're going to speed up if we can continue to focus on that.
00:26:05.668 - 00:26:16.390, Speaker A: Got it. And so then a lot of people here are curious how to get into web3 or how to be a founder. Web three, maybe. Steve, actually, from you, how can they be the next Steve Ellis?
00:26:17.770 - 00:26:48.558, Speaker E: I don't know. Patience is good, but perseverance and determination. But I consider it a lot of luck. And, yeah, find the places where you think it's going to be really impactful and try to focus on that. The things people aren't doing yet because there's tons of opportunities popping up constantly. The space moves so quickly, so just look for sort of where there are new openings as these new tools pop up.
00:26:48.644 - 00:27:11.638, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember when I first joined Chainlink, like four and a half, five years ago, I was boothing at these hackathons and no one knew what Oracles were. They're like, why do you need Oracles? I'm like, because all this and people didn't quite believe. And now, years later, we had that head start and we started building, and now all of a sudden it was like, oh, my God, Oracles are so critical. Right? And you saw that even before everybody else.
00:27:11.804 - 00:27:22.410, Speaker E: Yeah, there was a long time where it was hard to even talk to people about it. Like, people weren't even interested and it could have died on the vine. I was scared of that, but, yeah, glad I stuck with it.
00:27:22.480 - 00:27:45.730, Speaker A: Perseverance. Any other tips? Mike, you had a great article on LinkedIn about how to get into web3, right, and why you chose it.
00:27:45.880 - 00:27:46.580, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:27:47.670 - 00:27:49.618, Speaker D: So the question is like, how do you get into.
00:27:49.704 - 00:27:52.500, Speaker A: Yeah, for those who aren't, how do they become you guys?
00:27:55.670 - 00:28:39.422, Speaker D: I'll maybe ask a question for those who aren't yet formally in, have a job or full time in the industry, and I'm speaking from more of a non technical background. I think the most important thing that I found was just to get in there and experiment. I mean, I'm surprised how many people I'll still interview. And have you done a defi transaction? No. Have you bought an NFT? Have you minted an NFT? So, I mean, those are like a starting place, pretty basic, but you'd be surprised how many people are reaching out, wanting to get into the industry. And the first place, of course, to start is experimenting. I think the next thing, and maybe this is a little bit similar to Steve, is that you got to have conviction or a thesis, in my opinion.
00:28:39.422 - 00:29:17.070, Speaker D: When people look for work, I find that on average, the average person is a bit reactive. It's like a couple searches or someone reached out to them and instead pick your thesis. Right. So maybe if you're not going to start a web3 business like Steve, but you want to get into one, well, what are you passionate about? What do you have conviction that you think is an area that's going to drive it? So I was very targeted. I had a very small set of companies I was interested in and projects I was interested in and went directly at them versus just starting to scatter interest all over the place.
00:29:17.220 - 00:29:30.450, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, let me, time for one last question, and I really want to know this. You guys are all brainiacs. So what is one book that you will gift to somebody? We'll start with you, Dahlia.
00:29:30.790 - 00:29:31.858, Speaker B: One. Not two?
00:29:31.944 - 00:29:34.610, Speaker A: Just one? Just one and maybe why.
00:29:34.760 - 00:29:42.760, Speaker B: All right, so I'm thinking of two. So I'm going to take a vote. How many people here are interested in cooking? Raise your hand.
00:29:43.690 - 00:29:45.640, Speaker A: A good 25%.
00:29:46.490 - 00:29:50.890, Speaker B: How many people are interested in finance and macroeconomics?
00:29:51.790 - 00:29:53.318, Speaker A: I think finance.
00:29:53.494 - 00:30:02.886, Speaker B: All right, I will go with the cookbook. Seek me afterwards if you want some cookbook recommendations. You're not allowing me to.
00:30:02.928 - 00:30:05.246, Speaker A: Okay, maybe I'll give you two.
00:30:05.268 - 00:30:25.710, Speaker B: I think anybody in the field that wonder understands how the system of central banks have emerged in response to the large financial crisis of the last century and how they dealt with that financial crisis, which is not a great timing to talk about that. Absolutely. Has to read Lords of finance.
00:30:25.790 - 00:30:27.874, Speaker A: Okay, Lords of finance.
00:30:28.002 - 00:30:32.934, Speaker B: Cool. And it's a fascinating book. It's mesmerizing to read.
00:30:33.052 - 00:30:35.270, Speaker A: Very cool, Kamal.
00:30:35.850 - 00:31:10.318, Speaker C: So my book would probably be 4000 weeks. I don't know if anyone has read it, but it's actually 4000 weeks is the average lifetime of a human. It sounds kind of crazy when you put it that way. And it's not one of these books like, oh, you don't have a lot of time, just go do something crazy. It's more about like, obviously start with this premise. Right. But it's like, what do you do once you know that? I think it's getting back to the notion of urgency.
00:31:10.318 - 00:31:33.434, Speaker C: I think for me it was a really interesting book reflecting on what I wanted to do next, what I wanted to spend my time on, and just picking something that I felt was meaningful. And so I find it. I mean, I'm not going to do justice to the book. So I would encourage any one of you who's interested in that topic, in reading it.
00:31:33.552 - 00:31:46.620, Speaker B: That reminds me thinking about my own life. I did edit a book and I do get, I don't know, like two bips of a cent on every copy that, you know.
00:31:47.010 - 00:31:50.830, Speaker A: Do you want to plug your book? Can I make a. Yeah, you can make a plug.
00:31:52.130 - 00:32:01.346, Speaker D: So actually I was going to use a different book, but real quick, I just finished a book called Lifespan, which actually is interesting, I guess. How many weeks did you just say the book was?
00:32:01.368 - 00:32:02.002, Speaker C: 4000.
00:32:02.136 - 00:32:33.626, Speaker D: 4000. So this maybe would double it. There's a lot of great research and science happening now to extend longevity. They're starting to be able to reverse aging in certain areas. So hopefully that his book will be updated and doubled for all of us in our lifetimes. But the book I was going to recommend I've sent out to people's book called Range. And so what range is about is generalists and end up doing a lot of the most valuable things often in the world because they connect dots.
00:32:33.626 - 00:33:11.994, Speaker D: They've had different industries or different functions or different places they've lived. And I guess it speaks a little bit to how I've lived my life, which is not this straight line following these passions that sometimes may seem zigzaggy, doing what might be considered random things. But over time, I feel like it's really created a much more enjoyable life. And so that's what his book argues. They'll give the example of a lot of people think like, say, Tiger woods and golf. Like you started at what, three, four years? That's the way you're great at something. I'll turn him as like Federer, who didn't pick up tennis till teenage years.
00:33:11.994 - 00:33:24.080, Speaker D: He was a general athlete. So I just think it's an insightful way to live your life and have a growth mindset and explore a lot of different things, even if you don't know ultimately where you're going.
00:33:24.770 - 00:33:25.520, Speaker C: Nice.
00:33:25.970 - 00:33:32.160, Speaker E: I was going to say Dahlia's book on the work of Leslie Lamport. But since that's already been taken, I'll go with.
00:33:35.030 - 00:33:38.114, Speaker B: I only have 4000 weeks to live according to.
00:33:38.152 - 00:33:38.946, Speaker D: That's true.
00:33:39.128 - 00:33:41.234, Speaker B: Please buy the book 8000.
00:33:41.352 - 00:34:02.650, Speaker E: But there's a book called the Systems Bible that I really like. It's got kind of an intimidating name, but it's nontechnical. It's about building systems, like organizations, technical systems, all kinds of systems. And it's sort of a philosophical, playful look at sort of the problems that come up in problem solving. So it's a good one.
00:34:02.720 - 00:34:36.610, Speaker A: Very cool. And I'll add one final book that I actually love is called how do you measure your life? It's a book by Clay Christensen, who was a business school professor, and he took economic models and applied them to life. So how do you find a job that's going to fulfill your passion? Or how do you measure what's important to you to have a fulfilling life? So that's one more to add to your list. And now you have a range of books. Well, with that, I just want to thank you, panelists and colleagues, for being here, and thank you, everyone, for being part of Snarkon.
