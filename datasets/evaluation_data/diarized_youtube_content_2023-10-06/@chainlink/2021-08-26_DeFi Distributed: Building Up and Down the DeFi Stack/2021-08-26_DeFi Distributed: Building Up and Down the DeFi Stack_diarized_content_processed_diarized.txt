00:00:05.850 - 00:00:43.366, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. My name is David. I'm on the ecosystem team here at Chainlink. We are joined today by another fantastic panel of guests who are each building unique Defi projects that are using the new building blocks of Defi in new and interesting ways. With me here we have Yan Wen Feng, who's the co founder of Perpetual Protocol. James Chu is a CTO of platon young El Kim, who does business planning at Pay Protocol, and Nick Ravenbach, who is the co founder of Base Protocol. So let's dive right in into how each of you is utilizing some of the building blocks of Defi.
00:00:43.366 - 00:01:01.520, Speaker A: I want to start first with the idea of composability. So please talk a bit about how your project takes advantage of composability and how Chainlink plays a role in your underlying architecture. And we can start with young Wen Fei Feng. Do you want to jump in?
00:01:03.270 - 00:01:48.478, Speaker B: Sure, of course. I'm Yang Wen. So I'm the co founder of Perpetual Protocol. So perpetual protocol is on chain perpetual swap protocol that we provide decentralized perpetual swap on for us because we're on sky. So it's a little bit hard to compose with others, but we do use a lot of other protocols, like Chain link. So Chainlink is one of our basic PI feed. So we get the chain link PI feed as our index price to calculate the function rate.
00:01:48.478 - 00:02:36.030, Speaker B: So that's very important to us. There are also other projects that built on top of us, even if we are on sky, but there are a lot of coach that you can utilize. So projects like Lema finance, they built on top of us. They provide basic trading protocol that you can kind of have a piece of asset on spot market, and also you short that on our platform, and then you can kind of earn the funding rate through that. So I think that's how we try to be more composable. And we are actually working on a v two. So the v two of perpetual protocol will be on Arbitron.
00:02:36.030 - 00:03:08.540, Speaker B: I believe that there will be a lot of new opportunities for us to compose with others. We are actually talking to lots of other projects, like charm, like others, they can either build on top of us or we can use some of their component. So, yeah, really looking forward to kind of moving on a new layer to arbitron or optimism and compose with others.
00:03:10.270 - 00:03:20.730, Speaker A: Great. Thanks so much. And that's really exciting news about arbitrum there. Looking forward to that. James, how you use composability.
00:03:21.550 - 00:03:59.786, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you for having me here, James, from Platon. So regarding the composability, because Plateau is quite unique on this. It's not a pure kind of blockchain, technology driven stuff. On top of it, we are focusing on privacy and focusing on AI. So at the end, we will form a distributed privacy AI network. So protected data, protected AI model, protected computing power, all kind of working together with each other.
00:03:59.786 - 00:04:45.826, Speaker C: So regarding chainlink, because the financial data is the most simple, straightforward one. And that's also why the blockchain is quite successful on this field. So platinum will also start with digging and working with this DFI and financial related stuff. We will announce the cooperation with chain link. Last year when the sandbox called ally went live on October 24. It stands for remember. By that time I was kind of tried to express my expectation to chain link as the data provider, as the market data provider.
00:04:45.826 - 00:05:36.946, Speaker C: There are real time market data, historical market data, evaluation model, et cetera, et cetera. All this kind of stuff could be privacy protected and could be a data asset platform. And there will be the so called privacy economy. So based on this privacy protected algorithm, then there will be a new type of how to cooperate with each other, how to settle with each other. So Pluton has this kind of three layer. The fundamental one is blockchain with the automated settlement clearing, trustless with native like fundamental privacy supported. And then there will be another layer, the DaO style of privacy economy.
00:05:36.946 - 00:06:38.858, Speaker C: And then there will be the privacy AI network. Recently we could call it AI brain or artificial general AI, et cetera. So it's a very important first step to work close with Chainlink on the data as a data provider side. And there's a long way to go. I hope we can cooperate more in the long run, can empower the existing Defi, this composability defi, et cetera, to empower it with privacy preserving capability. And then there is a lot of, I could explain later on, like the manner can front run for something, right? So we could still have your business down there, have a very simple result there. So the data are real in it, but the manner cannot see it.
00:06:38.858 - 00:06:50.990, Speaker C: Then it will theoretically prove in the front run from the data provider side as well. There are a bunch of thread we could work together. Thank you, David.
00:06:51.490 - 00:07:05.182, Speaker A: Thanks so much, James. That's super interesting. And Nick, you're building something incredibly exciting over there that's pulling together a lot of different things. Do you want to talk a bit about your project and how you think about composability as well?
00:07:05.336 - 00:07:44.114, Speaker D: Yeah. So I'm here representing base protocol. For those who aren't familiar, it's a synthetic asset whose price is pegged to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. So if the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is $1.5 trillion, the price of base is pegged at a dollar 50. If it's 1 trillion, base is one dollars, if it's 500 billion, base is base price tracks the overall cryptocurrency market cap, and it does so through a process called rebasing. I'll kind of get into that in a second.
00:07:44.114 - 00:08:54.114, Speaker D: But on the question of composability, when you aim to create a token whose price tracks the overall cryptocurrency market cap, you're going to ask yourself the question, where are you deriving that data from? Who's saying what the total crypto market cap is? Because that number is going to vary widely from different sources. And so for this project ever to exist, we knew that we needed resilient, reliable oracles. And so from the beginning, we've really always been sold on Chainlink as kind of the leading provider for oracles in the ecosystem. And so long before we formally engaged with Chainlink, we were really consuming a lot of the chainlink documentation and YouTube tutorials. And we actually set up a chainlink node of our own just to kind of work with it and use as sort of a proof of concept. And I think that's really where composability came into play here because we were kind of able to use that as a building block. And then we more formally reached out to Chainlink and went mainnet with you guys in that respect.
00:08:54.114 - 00:09:52.742, Speaker D: And it was really great that we were able to build that proof of concept before again formally engaging and then having those things work, I guess, formally. So that's one way that we've been kind of taking advantage of composability is obviously our integration with Chainlink. And on one side that's for oracles, and then on a new side now we've really been able to take advantage of composability by integrating the chainlink keeper network. So the way that base works is through these supply adjustments that then affect price. To create that price peg to the total crypto market cap, to execute that rebase, there's a daily transaction that has to happen. And historically, up until recently, we've had a developer sitting there every day at 04:00 p.m., CST, clicking the rebase transaction function.
00:09:52.742 - 00:10:27.842, Speaker D: Every single day. He's just got to be awake, and that's what he's got to do. And we never knew that there was going to be a solution to this or when that solution would come. But then we saw that Chainlink was working on the keeper stuff and we reached out, and now those rebase transactions are completely automated. And it was a great feature that we were able to again introduce without anticipating that it would ever be a solution. But as it emerged, we were able to really bring it in. And it's an awesome attribute of composability in cryptocurrency that we were able to do that.
00:10:27.842 - 00:10:35.320, Speaker D: So two of my favorite examples of composability are really the work that we've done with Chainlink on the oracle side and on the keeper side.
00:10:35.850 - 00:10:49.320, Speaker A: Thanks so much, Nick. And I'm glad we were able to save your engineer a little bit of sleep over there. So now let's jump right over to pay protocol. Youngil, why don't you describe a little bit about what your team is building over there.
00:11:07.570 - 00:11:10.046, Speaker E: Andy beside me will be translating what.
00:11:10.068 - 00:11:11.360, Speaker C: I say for me.
00:11:39.890 - 00:11:51.470, Speaker F: Protocol young girl. Tori Haguin.
00:11:53.670 - 00:11:54.610, Speaker C: Status.
00:12:02.550 - 00:12:55.730, Speaker E: Yeah, so what paycoin is currently doing is that we provide a payment service that is based on virtual assets, crypto assets. We have a 2 million user base and we have partnership with franchises like Domino's Pizza. One of our service that we'll be providing is DFI. Our goal is to make DFI easy even to those who doesn't really know about crypto assets. We will be integrating various blockchain networks into our paycoin network, which means that we will need to constantly check each blockchain's network status, transaction status, and so on. And in order for us to deliver friendly use are friendly.
00:12:55.810 - 00:13:19.670, Speaker F: Uximida Iran Chimney Price Pidoa Shishai Pina solution pay Quintimon Saiyunjai Chazan Pyongyogue.
00:13:30.450 - 00:14:04.138, Speaker E: So it will be very inefficient for us to check and process all these data by ourselves. In this respect, Chainlink's price feed and CCIP are considered a very efficient solution for us. We plan to leverage Chainlink's price feed for the conversion rate between different assets and evaluating our users asset value, and we plan to leverage CCIP in connecting with other blockchains. That's it, Dave, perfect.
00:14:04.224 - 00:14:41.080, Speaker A: Thank you so much and for diving into that. I think it would be super interesting for everyone to hear a little bit more about the infrastructural challenges that everyone has building on this new frontier of Defi and how these building blocks are being incorporated. So I want to go to yen Wen again. Can you talk a bit about just some of these infrastructural challenges that we're facing and how we can overcome some of these from a technical implementation standpoint to really extend perpetual protocols capabilities. And I'll ask the same thing to the other panels as well.
00:14:42.730 - 00:15:24.498, Speaker B: Sure, yeah, that's a good question. So for perpetual poll, I think we have been actually launched over eight months right now. So we do have a lot of transaction happening on the poker. We have been processing like over 20 billion for the Toko trading volume. So we do have lots of volume on sky. But at the same time I think the first thing that we are not there yet is the bandwidth. So I think at some point of time we still take probably 30% to 40% of the bandwidth on sky, which is a really high number.
00:15:24.498 - 00:16:18.326, Speaker B: Sky have been doing a really good job. They don't really have any kind of outage during the last, I think a year, which is amazing. I think because they have us, they have the forest like the game on them, on this guy, which is working really well. But to be honest, I think that we still need another scaling solution, even if we are based on the sky. I'm really looking forward to the new technology like Rops ZK row ops or Miskix rops. So I do believe that although bandwidth is still the biggest concern that in everyone's mind, but it should be able to. Personally I really think that it should be able to serve like maybe in a few months I think.
00:16:18.326 - 00:17:11.334, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's definitely the first thing like bandwidth. The second thing definitely is the UX. So because we are doing this perpetual contract, a new financial instrument, so there are lots of people who are on central change, they want to come to us, try to try out this new DeFi protocol, but it's really hard for them. The first thing is that they have to install extension and then this extension actually holds all their funds. I think that it will be impossible for them to really believe in this. I'm not really saying that makeup mass is doing something wrong. I'm not saying that.
00:17:11.334 - 00:18:16.380, Speaker B: I'm just saying that we need more options, we need more ways for people to trust, especially when they kind of first come into this DeFi world. We just need to have a better way for them to understand the whole architecture, what options that you can do to keep your fund safe. Lots of these kind of concerns. So definitely I think that's that part that we already have a lot of progress, but still more. The last thing is that I would say is that for us, we are gax we have been compared to centralized change a lot, but to be honest, feature wise, I think we are far behind them, especially for a more complex derivative like perpetual protocol. So that's actually our responsibility to do a better job. I think.
00:18:16.380 - 00:19:14.094, Speaker B: At the same time, I think actually training help us a lot. The thing we can do is just to a certain degree, there are lots of infrastructure things that have to be mean at first, but I think changing has this mean they are actually pushing out a new thing that kind of like index or registry for price mean. So people who want to launch a market can check if the price feed there, and then we can kind of do this automatically. I think that without any manual process. So I think that's really cool. So definitely we need more infrastructure built by Chango others, and then we can have the features on central exchange that we can implement. So, yeah, I would just stop here.
00:19:14.212 - 00:19:24.580, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you so much. It's very interesting to hear how one project can take up so much bandwidth still on one network. So very good to hear. James will jump to you.
00:19:25.830 - 00:20:06.238, Speaker C: Thank you. So platinum is kind of open source. Try to build up infrastructure for starting with Defi, and then eventually get the AI brain or a data market, et cetera. So we are more focusing on the very fundamental stuff. So this famous FLP trilemma, or this AP trilemma, right, all this kind of applied to this. We call it trustless computing. I think back in 2018 when we reached this concept, privacy preserving, trustless computing, et cetera, we are kind of failing along.
00:20:06.238 - 00:20:50.570, Speaker C: Not many people echo what we are doing, and now there are so many people doing. I'm very happy. So looks like this is right approach, but we do facing a huge challenge on the infrastructure side. For example, blockchain natively is immutable, all the data, once added, you cannot remove it, et cetera. It will carry over like a train. If you add one kind of box, it will adding forever. Right? So how to draw a line, put what kind of thing off chain and what kind of thing on chain, but those things still can be trustless.
00:20:50.570 - 00:21:55.614, Speaker C: This will require pretty good privacy preserving technology, like we call it, must be veritable computation. So like ZK snarks is very successful right now, ZK rollops, et cetera. It will resolve certain disability issue. So what we could do is to provide pretty good research and come up with a very good engineered, time efficient, very good algorithms, so we could protect or compact, make those transactions, et cetera, in a package, and then you could quickly verify by your nodes on chain that will provide a very good trust and fast infrastructure. So this is the kind of fundamental. Also another one we are challenging is everything. DeFi is very smooth, very good, all transparent.
00:21:55.614 - 00:23:10.306, Speaker C: But if you really add this privacy preserving stuff, like the privacy decks related stuff, it will become slow. So that will against the user experience. So how to make a trade off on this? For example, I do not disclose everything I'm trading. If I trade a huge amount, I want to buy something or sell something with a huge amount I may got front run by mana or by others. There's a flash long, a lot of things may happen, right? I really want to hide a certain information away from the audience or from the blockchain. Only when my trade got executed, then I disclose by that time nobody quit front. So this kind of in the real traditional industry, actually we spend lots of like a cost, high cost, you see the bankers high salary, intensive regulation, third party or government office focus on auditing, et cetera.
00:23:10.306 - 00:23:20.762, Speaker C: So there is super high cost on this one. But DeFi with privacy preserving computation could resolve this one. Thanks so much James. Yeah, thank you.
00:23:20.896 - 00:23:27.358, Speaker A: And we are running short on time here, so we'll jump to nick and youngil for some final comments here.
00:23:27.444 - 00:24:02.230, Speaker D: Yeah, real quick, I'll just say for base protocol in terms of infrastructure challenges, just being a rebasing token with a dynamic elastic supply, there are a lot of challenges with integrating with different platforms. Uniswap V three is currently not supporting rebase tokens, but optimistically, Ampleforth has now just been approved for lending on Ave. So that's really great. So I'd like to see more things addressed for elastic supply tokens and in a more general sense, I would like to see a better UI for cross chain token bridges. I think that'll be really important in Defi.
00:24:02.650 - 00:24:06.840, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. Nick and Young El, closing thoughts from your side.
00:24:34.890 - 00:25:12.080, Speaker F: They talk the talk so to chai tongue cross chain, cross chain solution at the and sugar cross chain solution at the and young guru cross sing Kizuri Palsanzo, Iran service.
00:25:16.150 - 00:26:12.260, Speaker E: So yeah, quickly wrapping it up. There's a lot of Defi being released on various blockchain networks, and digital assets such as nfts are being used for Defi. We believe that in this regard. So currently the challenges are the compatibility between each networks still is an issue and there's a risk associated with transferring assets between the networks. So we believe that in the future there will be more demand for cross chain solutions and we're currently looking into how to solve this kind of issues. The paycoin team. And once we do have solutions to hatch these risks, we expect that we will be able to cover more digital assets in our services.
00:26:13.910 - 00:26:31.046, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you so much. And as you can see, we really could have gone for an hour or two here. We just scratched the surface of what is possible, and so we'll be glad to have everyone back here. So thank you so much for joining us. To all the panelists for making the time, and we'll hand it back to you.
00:26:31.068 - 00:26:45.680, Speaker G: Andy, thank you so much to all the panelists. Sometimes it's great to hear people's visions kind of come together, and the conversation that emerges, very valuable, not just for the audience, but hopefully for the presenters as well. So thank you all very much for your time.
