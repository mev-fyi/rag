00:03:26.120 - 00:04:31.180, Speaker A: You. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the fall chain link Hackathon 2021 closing ceremony. We are incredibly excited to be having this closing ceremony after such a long hackathon. About a month, a little bit more than a month here. It's been an absolute wild ride watching all the developers build mind blowing, incredibly creative, powerful, unique applications that are going to power the future. I've said it at the beginning in the opening seminar, but these hackathons are these stomping grounds of innovation. It's at these hackathons, it's at these cultivations of ideas and community members that we build the future of technology and of web3.
00:04:31.180 - 00:05:23.028, Speaker A: We have an amazing and absolutely amazing lineup for you today where we are going to be going over the winners of the chainly hackathon. And I am incredibly excited for this because these projects were fantastic. So let's just jump right into the presentation because we have a lot of projects to go over. Let's do it. So before we actually jump into all the projects and all the different amazing winners here, let's just talk a little bit about what happened. Who came here, who was here, who was at this hackathon. Now, we had over 7800 registrations, nearly doubled from the last hackathon.
00:05:23.028 - 00:06:06.470, Speaker A: We had 989 insane projects. Amazing. Absolutely fantastic. We had 92 people using chain link API, 90 people using chain link VRF, 64 people using chain link data feeds, 46 people using chain link keepers. We had an absolutely insane amount of projects using all these different chain link tools to build these incredibly powerful hybrid smart contracts. Right? And one of the things that's also fantastic is the vast majority of people here were new to blockchain. I think it was about 50% of the people here are new to blockchain, they're new to engineering, and they came and they built something and they submitted something and a lot of them might have won, which we'll find out in just a second.
00:06:06.470 - 00:06:57.908, Speaker A: So with that being said, we absolutely amazing turnout here. This is more than double what we saw at our hackathon in spring. In just in six months, more than double the size of this hackathon, more than double the projects came here and just built amazing things. So again, before we jump into the projects, we have to, have to, have to give a major thank you, a major shout out to all the fantastic sponsors who were a part of this. There are so many wonderful participating technologies here. If you see any of these, definitely 100%, be sure to give them a thank you. And additionally, not only the sponsors and participating technologies, but a major thank you to all the hackers and all the community members and everyone who came to the sack on that and made this a massive success.
00:06:57.908 - 00:07:26.268, Speaker A: Of course, this includes a lot of the people at Chainlink Labs who I've given a shout out to before. I'll give a shout out at the end of this presentation as well. Thank you all so much for being here and being a part of this. It's an absolute ride, and we are so excited that you're all here and you all decided to take part in this hackathon together. So with that being said, let's just jump into it. Let's jump into the prizes. So I know I said in the calendar invite that this is going to be about 2 hours.
00:07:26.268 - 00:07:57.268, Speaker A: I think we're going to make it a little bit shorter than that. We're going to get right through these. So there were $550,000 in hackathon prizes here. An absolutely insane amount. Just pinging somebody who can't get into the studio here that we will let them in shortly. We will let the winners in shortly. 550,000 in hackathon prize winners.
00:07:57.268 - 00:08:24.464, Speaker A: And we are going to be announcing at this presentation to all the major prize winners. So everyone else will get notified of their winnings next week via email. Not all the prizes are finished judging. This is just all the major prizes. It's the vast majority. As we go along, we'll tell you which ones we did and then which ones we haven't yet. Again, the sponsor prizes are going to be handled by their respective team.
00:08:24.464 - 00:08:56.500, Speaker A: So if Avalanche has a prize, the Ava Labs team will be the one to give out the prize. And the chainlink prizes, the grand prize, et cetera, that will be handled by Chainlink labs. So let's just jump into it. So our first prizes on the list is going to be the chainlink on the rise winner. These are projects that were absolutely phenomenal. They came into this space, they built something really cool, and we wanted to recognize them for that. So we have 45 of these projects.
00:08:56.500 - 00:09:29.424, Speaker A: Don't worry, we're not going to go through all of them. 45 of these projects, $500 in link to each one of these projects. Absolutely phenomenal job to everyone here. Everyone on this list that showed up, made something really cool, learned a ton, and then additionally they're going to get some money, right? And that's a blast. So I know there's a ton here, but this is the list of the 45 products that won this prize. We will be emailing you, we will be sending some communications to give you the prize. Here of $500 each in link token.
00:09:29.424 - 00:09:59.324, Speaker A: So this is the list. I'm not going to ratle off everyone's name here because there is a massive amount, but if you're kind of curious, feel free to pause the video and see if you're on this list. Additionally, we will go back and we will email you so you will get communications from us saying that you won. Congrats to everybody on this list. Everybody on this list had a really fantastic project and they deserve recognition. So huge congrats to everybody here. Additionally, we had what we called top quality winners.
00:09:59.324 - 00:10:30.280, Speaker A: These were also projects that did fantastically well. We thought they were like just below. We thought that they weren't going to win one of those major prizes, but they were still absolutely phenomenal prizes. They could have just as easily won, but unfortunately you can only choose one winner. So these were the top quality winners. So there were 20 of these prizes of $1,000 and huge congrats to them as well. These are the projects that we consider the top quality projects.
00:10:30.280 - 00:11:11.764, Speaker A: For the $1,000 link prize we have block reg, strong incentive, homepage, dow, obey, alchemist, war, dropshop, fantasy campaign, hourglass, satellite, broadband, service, chain, waygold, steadydal, daily, stacker, net zero, builder, rig struck, finance, easel studio, Swapvall V, tsunami protocol, and hacka link. Absolutely fantastic job to everybody on this list here. $1,000 each and you learned a ton. You networked a ton, you met a ton of new people. This is absolutely phenomenal. Huge congrats to everybody on this list and really excited to see what these projects build in the future. Their journeys are just really, just getting started here, right.
00:11:11.764 - 00:11:34.920, Speaker A: This is really just the starting points. So huge congrats there. Now we're going to go over the sponsor prizes. And this isn't all of the sponsor prizes. This is going to be some of the majority of them. Some of them still haven't finished judging. 300 projects is a lot to go through in about a week and a half because that's how long we gave them to judge.
00:11:34.920 - 00:11:56.900, Speaker A: So some of them are still judging. We'll let you know at the end which ones have not been judged yet. Let's go ahead. First off, the woman led winners. So originally there was just one prize of $10,000. We actually ended up splitting that into two because there were just two absolutely phenomenal projects. Figma and crick NFT.
00:11:56.900 - 00:12:16.088, Speaker A: Really cool projects. Congratulations to the two of them. MGD was the Dow behind this to help bring this to light. So these projects absolutely knocked it out of the park. Huge congratulations to Figma and crick, NFT for $5,000 each. Huge congrats. Moving right along.
00:12:16.088 - 00:12:48.304, Speaker A: And again, I'm going to be a little bit quick here because we have so many products to get through. And there's a couple of projects waiting to present. The Morales winners is regalis. I hope I'm saying that right. Huge congratulations. That's a $10,000 prize from Morales. And additionally there was a pooled prize, something like 30 or $40,000 for the rest of the protocols that used Morales, which is absolutely exciting that you all use MorAlEs and you all literally get to take part in a prize simply by using the technology, right? These pool prize are so fantastic.
00:12:48.304 - 00:13:20.076, Speaker A: So huge congratulations there. UFO gaming has three absolutely massive prizes. Space tumble wins first place of $30,000 in the UFO token. Second place is going to go to plantation. Third place, Pika place, Pokedex of $5,000. And for those of you who are here who are watching this right now, you can also check all these out in the project gallery of the chain link hackathon. So for those of you who are like, oh, that sounds like a really cool project.
00:13:20.076 - 00:13:35.968, Speaker A: What is that? What does it do? Go to the chain link dev post and you can see every single one of these projects in here. Every single one of them. You can sort by prize. You can sort by what they did. You can search, like I said, an absolute massive. I got it wrong, 280. Not 280.
00:13:35.968 - 00:13:55.032, Speaker A: Um, but you can check out all these projects. You can contact them, you can ask them about their projects. They all did a phenomenal job. Really fantastic job to everybody in this project gallery here. But in any case, yes, these are the three winners for the UFO prize. Huge congratulations here. This is a massive prize here.
00:13:55.032 - 00:14:17.968, Speaker A: So awesome. Moving right along, next is Filecoin. The Filecoin winners. So Filecoin had a couple of winners here as well. D social net, first place of $15,000 in filecoin. Huge congratulations there for their social media prize. Dapro, I hope I'm saying that right.
00:14:17.968 - 00:14:39.732, Speaker A: Of $8,500 in filecoin. Nftwebstorage. There were two of those. Nft bingo and Ecoshift. Both won $4,250, which is fantastic. And Filecoin additionally gave out pooled prizes. So when people were like, hey, should I do a hackathon? The answer is like, yes, go to a hackathon and just use one of the technologies.
00:14:39.732 - 00:15:03.584, Speaker A: Because all these pooled prizes exist where they'll just reward you for just using the technology, which is fantastic. Huge congrats to everyone on this list as well. Let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Polygon. Polygon had a ton of prizes. Gaming dap Chestlink, $3,000 Dow tooling governor C $3,000 NFt Maddox Mike, $3,000.
00:15:03.584 - 00:15:36.604, Speaker A: Chainlink, VRF chain rand price feeds, space tumble. Each one of these projects won $3,000 in Polygon, which is absolutely fantastic for building these really cool projects. And again, if you haven't checked out these projects after this presentation, after this closing ceremony, go to dev post and check out some of these projects because they are absolutely insane. And who knows, maybe these are the next billion dollar protocols, right? 100%. Go check this out. So huge congrats to everyone on this list here. Polygon additionally had some runner up prizes here.
00:15:36.604 - 00:16:00.204, Speaker A: Seven runner up prizes of $500 each. Token rage Space Tombow Bee plantation fantasy campaign, hobbits of polygon and punchable. Each won $500 from the Polygon protocol. Fantastic. Awesome job. Awesome job, everybody. Ampleforth Hourglass fellow class 7500 ample and 2500 ample.
00:16:00.204 - 00:16:35.048, Speaker A: These protocols really understood the Ampleforth technology, which was really cool to see, right? So if you want to see some protocols and some engineers that really understand what Ampleforth is and what it does, definitely check out their projects because they did a beautiful job here. Congratulations to both of those moving along. Salana, the tsunami protocol won first place there, which I believe was $10,000. Sorry, I don't have the number on here. Congratulations to the tsunami protocol. Next, we have ceramic in three box. This was a pool prize, so anybody who used them wins.
00:16:35.048 - 00:16:54.292, Speaker A: Congrats. Congratulations to anybody who used ceramic and who actually used three box in their prizes. In their projects. You win a prize. Congrats, Harmony. Harmony had a couple of different prizes here, a couple of different projects. For the gaming prize, peak a place.
00:16:54.292 - 00:17:15.032, Speaker A: Pokedex won the prize there. For the composability award. Nft lift. And for the best, Harmony and Chainlink integration swap vault. Congratulations to the three of you there. Alchemy pooled prize. What? So if I just use alchemy, I win? Yes, spot on.
00:17:15.032 - 00:17:32.176, Speaker A: Yes, you did. Alchemy also had a main winner. They have not finished going through the projects yet because again, there were a lot of protocols that used alchemy. Makes sense because alchemy is a phenomenal tool. So a winner will be announced soon. But anybody who used alchemy in their projects, you win a prize. So huge.
00:17:32.176 - 00:17:56.628, Speaker A: Congrats to everybody who saw this, who took advantage of the generosity of the alchemy team, right? They gave two months of free node use, which was absolutely fantastic. So thank you so much, alchemy and huge congrats to everybody who used the alchemy tools here. There were a couple that have not been judged yet. The list is here. Avalanche, heco ens near seven ventures. I have three box on here, even though that is incorrect. Apologies.
00:17:56.628 - 00:18:37.904, Speaker A: Sushiswap, binance, superfluid and NFT port have not been judged yet. Additionally, the educational winners of eat the block, step university and chainshot have also not been done yet. We're still working on them. We will email you, we will connect with you if you want one of the boot camp seats, which is incredibly exciting for all the new engineers who want more informational on how to actually move forward and how to learn more about this web3 space. Awesome job. Now let's get into the chain link winners, shall we? I mean, let's get into the chain link winners. It's a chain link hackathon, right? It's a chain link hackathon.
00:18:37.904 - 00:19:15.824, Speaker A: Let's do this. So first we're going to talk about the 30 welcome nfts. This is another one that's going to be to be determined. So we had the welcome track for this hackathon where we have these prizes like the boot camps that we just went over for new projects coming into the space. So we have not gone over the welcome NFTs yet. We will do that and we will email the winners there, which will be incredibly exciting for the new projects to get that kind of push saying, hey, you're a new project and that's great. You're welcome here.
00:19:15.824 - 00:19:51.676, Speaker A: You did a great job. Welcome to Web three. And now let's get into our first, let me switch screens here real quick. Let's get into our first major prize, right? So we had a number of major prizes in this hackathon here, right? And again, you can check those out on the dev post, what those major prizes are. If you scroll down, you can see them all there. We had the grand prize, $30,000 in link. We had the chain link social impact prize of $15,000 in link, the NFT and gaming prize, $15,000 in link.
00:19:51.676 - 00:20:16.564, Speaker A: The d five prize, $15,000 in link. The Dow prize, $15,000 a link, chain link services three of them. One was $15,000.01 was $7,000 and one was $3,000 for anybody who builds a really cool chain link service. And those are going to be the major prizes that we're going to go over now. So these are the big ones, right? Really excited for this. Really excited to announce these.
00:20:16.564 - 00:20:33.690, Speaker A: And again, everyone who didn't win a prize here, I'm still so proud of you. All right. For submitting, for coming to the hackathon, and for learning. There are a couple of people I talked to and they literally get. Yeah, I don't even care about the prize. I've learned so much from this hackathon. I'm ready to go on and do the next thing.
00:20:33.690 - 00:20:50.408, Speaker A: So huge congrats to everybody who said, I'm going to take this hackathon and I'm going to be committed. This is where I'm going to start my journey. This is how it starts. This is where it is. Huge congrats to everybody who's been a part of this. And even if you didn't win an award here, that's okay. Huge congratulations.
00:20:50.408 - 00:21:13.160, Speaker A: Huge round of applause. You should give yourself a huge pat on the back because you are welcome here. You are a part of a fantastic community and we are going to do fantastic things. 2022 is going to be insane. It's going to be insane. And you're along for the journey. So with that being said, let's jump in to these major project winners.
00:21:13.160 - 00:21:35.804, Speaker A: Are you ready? Because I'm ready. Oh, I'm ready. Let me switch back to stream mode here. All right. First is the social impact winner. This is the project that built something to help humanity. It built something to have social impact to help the world.
00:21:35.804 - 00:22:05.876, Speaker A: They built something that using blockchain, using smart contract is going to transform the world to be a better place. And that winner is solay with $15,000 in link to soleil. So I believe soleil is here. I believe soleil is here. I got. Is your, is your budy here, too? I'm not sure. He's called Sam Humby.
00:22:05.876 - 00:22:30.904, Speaker A: If he's there. I don't know how I see who else is here. He might not be if he's in the comments section. Please go ahead and message something in the comment section. I only realize now that twelve people can be backstage at a time. So if you're here, post a message. Otherwise, Matt, we will turn it over to you because, huge congrats.
00:22:30.904 - 00:22:55.208, Speaker A: And we're going to have all these winners do a quick demo of what their project is. A quick five minute demo so that we can get through all these fantastic projects. Right. Also. And then we'll do a quick q a about the project because again, these are the projects that go off in the launch and they do the next big thing. So, Matt, without further ado, we'll turn it over to you, give a little demo of your project here. Awesome.
00:22:55.208 - 00:23:28.618, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Am I okay to share my screen? How do I do it? Yes, there's a share screen button at the bottom. Here we are. I've got it. I think I have to add it to the stream. I got it right here. Perfect.
00:23:28.618 - 00:24:05.074, Speaker A: All right. Awesome. I'll just quickly run through little presentation then. So, yes, the lay is basically a project that aims to help fight climate change by building two services for everybody to use. Little emojis here. So first service, sorry, is to provide a way for people to incentivize the entire solar industry with one transaction. And the second is to provide a free public feed of solar energy data aggregated from a range of providers.
00:24:05.074 - 00:25:37.010, Speaker A: So here's roughly how it works so users can pay Dai into our pool manager smart contract. So, for example, that would look like this from the user's perspective. The dye is then distributed to solar panel owners that have registered with the system proportionately, depending on how much energy they've generated that day. Also, when the users, they schedule how long they'd like that die to be paid out over, as well as a reward for incentivizing solar panel owners. The users are then rewarded with soleil tokens, like native token uses of that token, undetermined as of yet, but because it kind of represents that the user's done a good thing, it's kind of like a pseudo carbon credit, hoping that other people will be able to kind of build an economy around this token and indirectly fight climate change by incentivizing people to use the soleil platform. So because the DIA rewards act as an incentive for solar panel owners to scale up or get set up in the first place, and they also incentivize them to provide their data to us as well. So we can build up a large public data feed of solar energy generation data across loads of users, across loads of different providers.
00:25:37.010 - 00:26:52.300, Speaker A: And we used ceramic to store that on. Ceramic is kind of built on top of IPFs, but lets us create kind of mutable data streams on top of it. It's also a lot cheaper than storing it on chain. See, we made three data feeds. So we've got a data feed for the energy generation per site that's registered, a data feed for the dye earnings per site, and a data feed for the soleil rewards per user to make the payments gas efficient. We've looked to a cumulative Merkel drop solution. So instead of sending transactions to all of the users and all of the sites, we've got a chainlink node that will analyze the data feeds and calculate the Merkel route of that submit the Merkel route on chain, and then users are able to make claims through the website to claim their tokens when they're available to them, and they can do partial claims on that as well.
00:26:52.300 - 00:27:46.110, Speaker A: Yeah, the government grants already exist for solar panel owners in a lot of countries, but not in every country. But this is potentially much more efficient. It's completely transparent and it's easy to analyze the growth of the network and the solar industry. You don't have to be a government to participate in this, but you could be, you could be like a company, individual, anything. And the data feed that we generate as part of this could be used in loads of other projects as well. So next steps would be to work on decentralizing this. There's a few centralized steps at the moment, so we could decentralize that at the data source level.
00:27:46.110 - 00:29:08.166, Speaker A: So as well as comparing API monitoring API data, we can compare that with satellite imaging data and weather data to kind of verify that it's true. We can also have multiple chainlet nodes collaborating on maintaining the data feeds, and we can add governance into the system as well. So some examples of things that we could add to improve the platform as well is that you could have users being able to direct their funds to sites in a certain location. So we might want to fund sites in developing nations, for example, or incentivize new sites or pay sites more if they're giving more back to the grid, rather than just using the energy themselves, stuff like that. So to grow the network, we'd obviously support more monitoring APIs. At the moment, we're only supporting one and look to kind of kick start the network with incentivizing initial users as well. But yeah, beyond the cellar industry, this kind of pattern could be used for a different range of things.
00:29:08.166 - 00:30:09.980, Speaker A: Anything where you have a lot of people that are contributing to a common goal and their progress towards this goal can be measured empirically, you can reward them all in the same kind of way. So yeah, just some other examples where this could work is other sustainable energy sources. You could do one for open source software because you can measure the number of GitHub stars and forks. You can kind of get a judge of how useful a project is to people rewilding, reforestation using satellite data. If you've got a landowner, they might register to the system and say, I'm going to rewild my farmland or something and funding aid in developing nations. So you could have somebody say, I'm going to go and build a well. And you can verify that with satellite data.
00:30:09.980 - 00:30:38.594, Speaker A: You can measure the progress basically towards helping a big goal, whether that's energy as well or immunization rates in that country. That's it. I can show a quick bit of the web app, but yeah, just a big thank you to chainlink and all the sponsors. Some of the sponsor prizes are absolutely huge. It's insane. Matt, in the interest of time, it's so cool. Your front end is so cool, though.
00:30:38.594 - 00:31:10.174, Speaker A: In the interest of time, I do got to move this along. But I do want to do one question, Matt, especially for you and your teammates. So you're a hackathon veteran, right? This isn't your first rodeo. You've done a couple of these. What have you learned? What's the main differentiator between this hackathon and the last hackathon? And I think you won a prize two hackathons ago. Was that it? You won the main prize two hackathons ago? Yeah. So it was in the first hackathon, which was really my first time doing any kind of blockchain stuff at all.
00:31:10.174 - 00:31:33.294, Speaker A: That was only a year ago, but I was mostly doing the front end for that one. Didn't really understand. Well, I didn't know any solidity or anything back then. And since, well, over the past year, I've kind of gradually learned it in my own time. The last hackathon, did some solidity. Done more in this one. Yeah.
00:31:33.294 - 00:31:48.150, Speaker A: Just learning more and more. Learned about ceramic, this one, which is really interesting. I didn't know anything about them before, but yeah. Awesome. Absolutely love it, man. Yeah. So a year ago, didn't know anything about solidity, was new to blockchain.
00:31:48.150 - 00:32:08.234, Speaker A: And now you and your team, you're winning prizes, you're building these really cool projects. And Soleil, right? It's this fantastic tool that can help the world, right? Using blockchain. Absolutely phenomenal job. Matt, to you and your team. Your teammate is not here at the moment, unfortunately. What was their name again? Sam Humby. Sam Humby.
00:32:08.234 - 00:32:27.814, Speaker A: So huge shout out to Sam Humby for those of you in the comments saying, hey, where can I see a demo of this? 100%. Go to the dev post, the chain link hackathon, dev post for fall 2021. Look up Soleil. They have a link to their working demo and it's really cool. So definitely be sure to check it out. Thank you. So much.
00:32:27.814 - 00:32:50.142, Speaker A: Matt and the soleil team and huge congratulations again. All right, cool. Matt, if you could drop off the studio just so that other people could join. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. So awesome job. And that's just our first one, right? So a couple of people in the comments I see going, oh my goodness, look at that UI, look at that use case.
00:32:50.142 - 00:33:16.726, Speaker A: Really fantastic. Join web3, join blockchain. Right? In a year, you learned slidy building these awesome tools, all these awesome protocols. And something I forgot to do was I forgot to talk a little bit more about why these winners are such a big deal. Right? So just quickly looking back at the stream, our last hackathon winner, bridge, raised $5.5 million. Right? So these protocols, yeah, they're cool.
00:33:16.726 - 00:33:42.080, Speaker A: They're hackathon winners. They also go on to build fantastic things. Right? Vulcan exchange from the hackathon back in spring brought on Mark Cuban as an investor, which is absolutely massive. And a lot of projects actually do start from hackathons. For example, one is dot exchange. You might have heard of them. They also started off as a hackathon, as a hackathon project.
00:33:42.080 - 00:34:48.898, Speaker A: And additionally, all of these projects that are participating here are going to be eligible for all these projects that win here are going to be eligible for the VC pitch day, where they get to pitch their projects to venture capitalists to get some funding to take their ideas from idea to full blown protocol. So who knows? In a year maybe these are going to be the protocols that are dominating the web3 that are dominating the block space. And we are just so excited for all these projects in general. But in any case, let's move right along, shall we? There are so many phenomenal products that we have to talk to. Additionally, be sure to reach out and say hi to these teams and ask them questions. Just really fantastic, really cool products, right? Soleil is really cool, helping the environment using blockchain, but moving right along, as I've said, like 15 times now, we're going to go into the services category now. So what are Chainlink services? So Chainlink services are anything that helps the chainlink ecosystem grow better, grow stronger, and do something, right.
00:34:48.898 - 00:35:21.520, Speaker A: So these are the projects that enable developers to build more of these hybrid smart contracts in an easier way. And that's what these chainlink services are. And that's exactly what the winners that you're about to see have exemplified. So let's jump right into the three winners. So we have kotal adapter JS and Chainlink Iris. So total first place with a $15,000 prize adapter JS with a $7,000 prize and chain link iris with a $3,000 prize in link. I believe we have some of them here.
00:35:21.520 - 00:35:42.982, Speaker A: I would love to start with chain link iris. Chain link Iris. Are you in the chat here? Let me find you here. Ethan. Yes, ethan, hi, how are you? Good, how are you? Welcome, welcome, ethan. All right, so five minutes on the clock, my friend. Okay.
00:35:42.982 - 00:36:10.910, Speaker A: Tell us about chain link Iris. Yeah, let me see if I can share my screen. Yes, there's a little share screen button at the bottom. All right, there we go. Can you see my slides? You're in, my friend. Awesome. All right, well, I just want to say thank you first of all to all the sponsors into chainlink.
00:36:10.910 - 00:36:39.960, Speaker A: Super organized this hackathon. Super impressive and a lot of great resources. So thank you. I guess I'll get right into it. My project is called Chainlink Iris. My name is ethan Bond. So basically, the problem that I set out to solve was when I was researching and brainstorming, I found the whole purpose of Chainlink is share data between oracles and everything.
00:36:39.960 - 00:38:21.482, Speaker A: It seemed if you don't have a specific knowledge base to be able to interact with existing APIs or know how to make custom solutions for certain iot devices like seen on this slide, or certain sensors, for a nontechnical person to be able to get data, real analog data, that's in the world of atoms rather than the world of bits, onto the blockchain, there's not a whole lot of solutions that I found for that that are really broad and could fit a lot of use cases. And so I thought a lot about that and how could you make it so that there's already an adapter in place and what could people use? And the solution that I came up with, I called Chainlink Iris, and basically to go through an example I think would be the best, it uses computer vision. So the example here would be, say you have a local sporting event. So in this slide, it's a hockey game, and you want to take data about that event and get it onto the blockchain for whatever you use case, whether it's betting or just keeping a record of some kind. And if it's a local hockey game, you're not going to have ESPN or Fox Sports recording those scores or the data about that. So the thought is that someone could register the event with Chainlink iris and with it they register a data policy. So there would be a big set of data policies that say, hey, use this specific computer vision algorithm to extract this kind of data, this is what we want from the frames that are sent.
00:38:21.482 - 00:39:13.180, Speaker A: And then anyone with a camera or like a smartphone would be able to, through the Chainlink Iris endpoint stream, video stream the frames of the event to Chainlink Iris, which would then implement that data policy and extract clean JSON like seen here. So that it's very simple, this example, score home in a way. So there's that. I was going to do a demo and I'll give it a shot here, but my computer is running really slow, so I already have this event registered here. And the data policy, I call it that I have for it is just to read text so you can see me there. It's very rudimentary. I just have this piece of paper that says chain link on it.
00:39:13.180 - 00:39:59.686, Speaker A: So let that register on there and it's been recorded. And now if I go, I don't have the local node running to call this from a contract or anything, but I'll just show you at the endpoint the API if it loads. It's very basic get request that just has the data. Yeah, see that's running slow. So while that's loading, I guess one of the other cool features when thinking about this is if it were democratized, you could have all sorts of people, anyone who they wants to could upload, stream video and it would be kind of trustless. There would be no single person streaming the video. Here we go.
00:39:59.686 - 00:40:52.370, Speaker A: It loaded. So we have chain link, we have the date, and I'll go over this. So one confirmation here means that only one person, only I right now, am the one uploading this specific state of this event. Right now, one person has confirmed it, and this time off is something else I wanted to go over was thinking about how could we make it. So it's really hard to take over and hack this and have people send data about other events. And the person who's putting on the event could use something like this. I called it time auth, and basically it's just a bunch of boxes that have different colors, it represents binary, and it's a mod of the timestamp from when the event has started.
00:40:52.370 - 00:41:22.574, Speaker A: And obviously this isn't random, it's just incrementing by one. But ideally, if this is in the frame, it would be another step to make it harder to fake what's going on in the frames. And you could be able to show, have more people submit data and have it all confirmed and synced up by time. So that was really the idea there. And that's about all I've got. So I'm going to stop sharing there. Ethan, fantastic.
00:41:22.574 - 00:41:35.986, Speaker A: Yeah. When I saw this, I was absolutely blown away. The demo that you did was really telling. Right. In the video for everybody who wants to go check it out, go to the chain link dev post again. He does a video where he shows a real time. He holds up little flashcards.
00:41:35.986 - 00:41:52.982, Speaker A: They have, I think it was numbers or something. It interacts, right, with Chainlink dode. And this is the power that we really have. Right. It's truth, not trust. That's what we're looking for with blockchain. So Ethan, with something like this, which is so, like, I feel like it's like, cool.
00:41:52.982 - 00:42:31.702, Speaker A: This is cool. What is an application that you're most excited that would use chainlink iris? I think the example I gave in there would be sports related, and not just for betting or whatever, but for data analysis and anything. Sports. Having a decentralized sports API, I guess you could have like a casino with that or something. Just sounds like fun to have that and have no single authority that's determining where that information comes from. Absolutely. Well, phenomenal job, ethan.
00:42:31.702 - 00:42:51.386, Speaker A: Congratulations on being a chain link hackathon winner here. Thanks so much. Yeah. All right, great. We're moving on, right? I'm seeing some humorous comments here, but massive. Absolutely massive. Right? That fulfills kind of this ultimate vision of these smart contracts.
00:42:51.386 - 00:43:25.674, Speaker A: Really doing anything, taking in this iot data and being able to do really anything. Right. So this is really phenomenal, giving developers the ability to build more applications. So, speaking of which, that leads us to our next winner, our second place services winner, adapter JS. Adapter JS, are you here? I believe you are. Maybe you're not here. Adapter JS might not be here, which is okay.
00:43:25.674 - 00:43:47.986, Speaker A: Adapter JS, if you are here, just post in that private chat. If you're not here and you come on later, we'll have you present a little bit later. So it looks like adapter JS is not here. No worries. I'll do a quick explainer of what adaptive JS was. So for those of you who know Chainlink nodes are 100% customizable, you can make them do whatever you want, as we just saw. Right.
00:43:47.986 - 00:44:24.234, Speaker A: We saw Ethan build Chainlink iris, which customizes chainlink nodes to be able to take in iot data to build these decentralized smart contracts that use data that it sees in the real world. Now, building these external adapters can sometimes be a little bit tricky. They can be a little bit hard. You can be a phenomenal smart contract engineer and maybe need an external adapter to do something, and maybe you don't know how to build that external adapter. So adapter JS is a no code solution to building external adapters. It's a no code solution to customizing your chainlink node to be able to do literally anything. So adapt Js really blew us away.
00:44:24.234 - 00:44:50.758, Speaker A: It was a really fantastic project to give developers this tool to make it easier for them to customize their chainlink nodes without even having to code. Right. And some people who might be a little bit technical might be thinking, oh, well, they're engineers, why would the coders not code engineers are just like the rest of us. We want the easy solution. If there's an easy button, I'm going to hit it right. So this is an easy button for spinning up these external adapters. So awesome job to adapter JS again.
00:44:50.758 - 00:45:11.914, Speaker A: Definitely go check them out on the dev post for this hackathon. And for first place, we have koto. Koto, I believe you are here. I see your screen share and I see you. Hello, welcome. Hi Dotik, how are you? How are you doing? Thank you for the amazing event. Thank you so much for being here.
00:45:11.914 - 00:45:42.210, Speaker A: I'm really excited to hear about Kotal. Yeah, I will start presenting now. So hi everyone. Kotal is a Mustafa kali, founder of Kotal. Kotal is an open source company with a vision of simplifying blockchain DevOps. So using Kotal, you can deploy nodes, you can expose and you can stake across multiple protocols with little or no blockage in DevOps experience. Currently we are supporting Ethereum, one Ethereum, two IBFs, Filecoin and Bulkhode protocols.
00:45:42.210 - 00:46:29.720, Speaker A: And during the hackathon, within few weeks I and my team made Ahmed Salah. We have added support for a chair link to Kotal. We love open source. Kotal source code is published on GitHub. So you can use our dashboard, SDK, ABI and you can read our source code, you can contribute fork and you can support your protocol, you can even deploy it in your own infrastructure. Kotal is working on Google Cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, AWS, Digitalocean, Alibaba Cloud, or any environment where Kubernetes is available. So the core component of Kotal is blockchain, Kubernetes operator, and we are building abstractions around it like ABi, SDK, dashboard and others.
00:46:29.720 - 00:47:25.350, Speaker A: Here is an example of depending on centralized, closed, closed source infrastructure as service like Infuria. So Infuria goes down for more than 8 hours back in the end of 2020, and the big exchanges like finance stopped Ethereum transaction processing because they are depending on this provider. The same happened with Uniswap. Uniswap user wouldn't be able to access uniswap to swap tokens because you are depending on the centralized closed source Cloudflare IB phase gateway. You can think of quotal as an open source alternative to centralized API, gateway and node as service companies. You can think of Kotam as like GitLab to GitHub. It's open source, you can download it and you can deploy it in your own infrastructure to manage your nodes and manage the whole lifecycle of your blockchain ops.
00:47:25.350 - 00:48:07.406, Speaker A: After the Hackerson we will continue hacking and we'll continue developing our product. You will support more protocols like Polygon, graph, binance chain, Solana stacks and others, and you'll continue building a managed hosted service of Koto. Thank you Patrick and I'm ready for answering any question. Awesome. Yeah, this was another project that I watched the video and it was literally just like click OK, the chain link node spun up and I was like I need this, I want this. Absolutely fantastic. What was alternative is reading tons of documentation and what was that? Tricky and hard it can be, right? It can be a little bit tricky.
00:48:07.406 - 00:48:53.474, Speaker A: And just having an easy button again, like I just said for developers is fantastic. Let me ask you a quick question here. What was the inspiration behind doing kind of this node as a service here? What got you into this? Yeah, the inspiration is that in every ecosystem there is a closed source node as a service and API gateway that is consuming the majority of DaPs traffic like infuriates. For example in ethereum ecosystem more than 90% of traffic is flowing through infuria and when infuria goes down, all daps goes down. The same with cloud filler, RBFs and with services like Binata and others. So we are providing an open source alternative to the solutions. Awesome.
00:48:53.474 - 00:49:13.474, Speaker A: Absolutely phenomenal here. So any developer for your next project maybe take a look at codal, right? It may give you that edge. So thank you so much for being here and huge congratulations for being the first place winner of the services award. Thank you, thank you. Bye. All right, great. So we have adaptive JS here.
00:49:13.474 - 00:49:27.966, Speaker A: Thank you so much everybody in the comments for mentioning that. Again, apologies, there's a cap to the number of people who could be backstage. Wasn't aware of this previously but Morgan, you were with us. Hello. Hello. Welcome to the stream. Thank you.
00:49:27.966 - 00:50:24.366, Speaker A: So yeah, a little difficulty there but we are ready to better explainer of adapter JS than I did. Excited for. Yeah, so what adapter JS is, is it's an external adapter, which makes it much easier to add customization to your chain link request. So right now you'd have to build your own external adapter if you wanted to have custom functionality to your chain link request. And so why did I make adapter JS? Because smart contract development is honestly hard enough already. And so if we can limit whatever difficulties are there while developing an external adapter, I'm all for it. And so basically for other hackathon participants, you may have had difficulty setting up an external adapter yourself, either like getting the code to run or finding a node operator to host your adapter for you.
00:50:24.366 - 00:51:19.442, Speaker A: And it's also a struggle for node operators because every time someone wants to add new functionality to a chain link request, they need to create a new bridge and a new job. And this is the problem that adapter JS is trying to solve. So instead of you needing to create your own external adapter to make a customized chain link request, you can just send a custom request, right to adapter JS. So here's just an example of what a request would look like. So as you can see, it's just got some filler data in here, but basically whatever code you send as a string to the external adapter will get executed, and the return value of that code is what is going to be returned on chain. So an additional thing that external adapters do is they let you access authenticated APIs. Think like Twitter, for example.
00:51:19.442 - 00:52:07.574, Speaker A: You need an authentication key to be able to get data from Twitter. And adapter JS actually also allows you to do that while maintaining privacy of your authentication keys. And this is accomplished by essentially uploading your keys to the adapter JS database. And then when you make a request on chain, you can reference those uploaded keys and make the request without actually exposing those API keys in a public on chain request. So I've kind of got a demonstration of how that would be accomplished here. So in this example, we're actually going to be making a call to Twitter and just checking a boolean value. Did Elon Musk's latest tweet mention bitcoin? So one of the cool things that I developed with this is this simulator.
00:52:07.574 - 00:52:49.610, Speaker A: So this is the kind of no code part that Patrick is talking about. So instead of you needing to write solidity code, for example, you do need to know JavaScript. So it's not completely no code, but JavaScript is fairly easy to learn and that's really all you need to know is just a few lines of JavaScript. So what you would do here is you'd go to adapterjs link and then you get this really easy to use menu where you put in everything that you want. So first you put the URL that you're trying to hit, you've got your authentication token. Thankfully this is cut off so you are not seeing my whole token there. And then you can actually go ahead and upload this to the external adapter.
00:52:49.610 - 00:53:21.606, Speaker A: So this authentication header is not included in your on chain request. And then you actually put the address of the smart contract which is allowed to use this authentication header. So not just anyone can use your private tokens in a request and then just a reference Id to reference that. And then we can send a test request first just to make sure it's working so you don't have to test on chain. As you can see, false. Elon's latest tweet did not mention bitcoin. And then finally here we can click the generate code button.
00:53:21.606 - 00:54:43.378, Speaker A: And what this will do, this will actually generate the solidity code and it's got just some instructions here for a little bit of setup, but really you can just copy and paste this whole thing right into your smart contract, deploy it and you're good to go. So you can see an example of that right here. This is the string that's going to be sent to the external adapter in the chain link request, and it's got your custom code right there. So we'll go ahead and check this out. So the initial value we set to true, and then after we actually get the response from the chainlink node, it will set to false. There we go. So then they've got one other feature that I do want to go over with this, and in addition to being able to access any authenticated APIs, if you have a really large bit of JavaScript code, say like 5100 lines, maybe 1000 lines, you can actually upload that JavaScript file to IPFS instead of sending all your code as a string in an on chain request.
00:54:43.378 - 00:55:21.806, Speaker A: Then you'll just send the content id of that JavaScript file where the external adapter will now download that file and execute it to process the data that was fetched during the HTTP request. I do have a quick example of that. So again, make it as easy as possible. You don't have to know how to even write solidity. So you come into this tool we got here, paste in the URL. In this case we're going to go to an altcoin news page and just return back the most mentioned top 50 altcoin on that page. So it uses web3 storage to upload the JavaScript file.
00:55:21.806 - 00:55:35.862, Speaker A: I've already got it all loaded. We'll send request. I'd already sent it before. So Luna looks like it's most mentioned. It was mentioned four times. And then finally we generate the code. So this code can then be paste into the smart contract.
00:55:35.862 - 00:56:16.340, Speaker A: I've got an example of it here. And then we'll run it and it should let us know that same value on chain. So it should say an initial value here in a second. You want to zoom in just a. Sure, sure. Yeah well you can see it's Luna there, not too interesting. So we'll keep it moving here.
00:56:16.340 - 00:56:55.790, Speaker A: So as for future plans for this project. So the future goal is to actually deploy this external adapter for nodes for Ethereum, polygon, binance, smart chain and avalanche, and also any other chains where users think they'll might actually use it. Anything that supports chainlink. I also want to add support for long strings. Currently it only supports the basic Ethereum types, bytes, 32 ints, bool, et cetera. I guess those are all of them. And then also support multivariable responses, which is something that Chainlink has fairly recently added as an ability.
00:56:55.790 - 00:57:34.278, Speaker A: Then also I want to add the ability for users to import kind of more common node JS modules. So instead of having to pack everything into a single JavaScript file and upload it, you can just import things. For example axios if you want to make multiple HTTP requests and maybe combine all that data and do a single post of all that data on chain. That's going to be possible very soon. And then also just continuing to add functionality like I mentioned, the modules and then expand documentation as well. So I also do have an ask. I would love people to join the adapterjs link discord.
00:57:34.278 - 00:58:13.174, Speaker A: So just go to adapterjs link, click the contact button and you'll be able to join our discord. I'm currently seeking some feedback on what blockchains people would like deployed to and just kind of what people are looking for for new features. Awesome. Well Morgan, this is fantastic. I'm so excited that you did get a chance to present apologies for the little technical difficulty there. There are so many developers in the chat and this is one of the things I love about this is you can tell there are developers watching this, right? Because you had so many people being like I need that, I want this for all these services, right? And for this one in particular, too. So I do have a quick question.
00:58:13.174 - 00:59:06.546, Speaker A: So what's your background? How did you know and how did you learn to use all these tools together? What's your background? What are you expertise in? Actually, robotics has been my main focus, but I kind of fell in love with blockchain shortly after I got my degree. So graduated in December with robotics and then kind of realized like, wait, blockchain is really cool and I can much more easily work from home if I'm doing blockchain stuff. So got super passionate about it, just started researching. And one of the things I really am interested in is the oracle problem. I think it's the most interesting part of smart contracts and I really want people to be able to access just any data on the Internet very easily. And that was kind of something I've always been passionate about. And once I started, actually, I kind of started off going a little bit of a different direction.
00:59:06.546 - 00:59:54.438, Speaker A: When I started the hackathon, I didn't 100% know I wanted to do this, but as I started making an external adapter, I realized it's not super hard, but it is a little bit more technical. And if I could just build something to make that easier, well, that would improve the ecosystem and just make blockchain that accesses data from the real world much easier for developers to actually make a reality. Absolutely. I love the mission, love the philosophy, love the mentality. I feel like the three of you should all just get together and just build it. The sky's the limit. When I saw the chain link Iris project, especially because that was the first one I saw, yeah, I was like, I really want to get involved with that.
00:59:54.438 - 01:00:20.560, Speaker A: I'm hoping we can connect because I think that you can make a larger vision of making these customized chain link requests much more accessible for people and super powerful Ethan and Morgan going to do great things in the future. Awesome. Well, fantastic job. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for presenting and showing us that huge congratulations. Thanks. All right, great.
01:00:20.560 - 01:00:44.242, Speaker A: So that is the services track. Amazing projects here. And we have a couple more. Right, what do we have left? What do we have left here? We have gaming, DFI, Dow and grand. And we are going to go in that order. We're going to go right to the NFT and gaming. This is another $15,000 prize in link token.
01:00:44.242 - 01:01:17.602, Speaker A: The NFT and gaming winner is space Tombow. Huge congratulations to space tombow. Hopefully I'm saying the name of your protocol, right. I'm going to pull all of you up on now? I have one space tombow. Where's the rest of the space tombow? That's the share screen. We have two. Hi, Patrick, how's it going? Good.
01:01:17.602 - 01:02:14.040, Speaker A: It's actually my screen. That's micro. Yeah, the rest of the team was supposed to be there, but they couldn't make it. So they had a bit of a presentation made, but I didn't pick it up. So I'm going to improvise a little bit on this. So basically for a space tombow, the idea was to, when you want to donate some money to a charitable organization, most of the time the process to do it is very formal. You donate the money through PayPal or some kind of regular banking system, and then you just go through and great, you're participated into the event, but you don't feel like so rewarded as much.
01:02:14.040 - 01:03:30.454, Speaker A: And so we were like, okay, how can we use blockchain to secure a way to get into people, into lotteries? That would help. Great social project, but at the same time, how can we bring more people? Well, let's implement gamification. And that's the whole idea behind Spacetombo. So basically what you do, you create a lottery for a specified charitable organization, which has an Ethereum address, and then you push the lottery events and all the parameters of the lottery on chain, and then everyone can participate to it. And once you participate to the lottery, you get a ticket back, and that ticket is an NFT. And what's the most interesting part is that this NFT is actually dynamic. What does that mean? That means that the lottery has many, like all the money raised through buying those tickets are handed to one pool, one specific pool that's called the Herth pool.
01:03:30.454 - 01:04:09.354, Speaker A: And so every funds in the hearth pool will go into the charitable organization address at the end of the lottery. And there are multiple periods that I will just come here. So it's kind of a technical diagram, but it's a good way to understand. Hey, I'm not sure if there's a setting you can adjust. Your mic is given some serious feedback. Okay, let me see. Is it a bit better? No, sorry about that.
01:04:09.354 - 01:04:49.490, Speaker A: No worries. Yeah, we'll just keep going. I'm not sure I can improve that. Okay, so sorry, everyone, for the quality of the audio today. So basically, you just create the lottery and all the parameters of the lottery. The parameters of the events are sent on chain, and so each event will basically pick some NFTs down the line. So let's say you have 100 person participating into the lottery at each event there is a 50% halving.
01:04:49.490 - 01:05:36.358, Speaker A: So let's say event one, you only have 50 people remaining. And actually we modify the NFT by modifying the image of the NFT. And so we can do that. And it's randomly picked using chaining VRF, which is awesome. So each event just triggers a VRF command that with a callback calls the event. So once the lottery is created, we have to fund the lottery with links in order for it to just be able to start. And once it's funded with enough links, the participation period starts so everyone can get in.
01:05:36.358 - 01:06:16.340, Speaker A: It's very easy for anyone just to buy a ticket. Then the participation period just ends at some timestamp defined at the lottery creation. And then we have the preparation period. So during this period, you can do a bunch of marketing about the lottery, just telling everybody about the lottery and getting some hype around the lottery, and you can modify your NFT. And I will enter into, I will just show a use case real quick after that. And then the preparation period ends, and then you get all the events. And for now anyone can trigger them.
01:06:16.340 - 01:07:01.730, Speaker A: But we are planning on implementing chain link keepers to just trigger those events. And I forgot to mention, but the price of the tickets are set in a fixed price, in USD, and this is made possible through chaining price feed. So really fast, I'll show you a use case. That's the name comes from there. It's space Tumble. So it's a lottery that happens in space. Basically you get your ticket as an NFT and so you can mint it, let's say here, I can choose and pick my ticket.
01:07:01.730 - 01:07:41.386, Speaker A: I will pick my little spaceship here, mint it, then I can confirm. And then I have right now my lottery ticket. And then during the preparation period, I will be able to add some shields, basically bonuses to this spaceship. And then at every event, the spaceship will evolve. So let's say there is a storyline. All the spaceships just take off from Earth at event one and they reach the atmosphere. And so a good portion of those spaceships are just destroyed.
01:07:41.386 - 01:08:25.082, Speaker A: And so at the end of all the events, you only have three winners. And again, these three winners, this is programmable. At lottery creation, everything is set on chain at the beginning, and the three remaining NFTs are the one who keep their image actually clean. All the other ones just have a wreckage of spaceship remaining. So that's pretty cool. And the last event triggers the release of the funds from the earth pole to the. Yeah, really quickly.
01:08:25.082 - 01:09:07.898, Speaker A: That's a very important point. All the funds raised during the preparation. So which is here goes to another pool that's called the moon pool. And all the moon pool funds will be released. So there is a percentage for the charitable organization, a percentage for the winners. So actually getting in to speed up a little bit just because basically it's just a win win situation in which you enter the lottery, but you also have a chance to get some money back and it's fun at the same time. Awesome.
01:09:07.898 - 01:09:20.314, Speaker A: Yeah. This project is so cool. Right? And the thing is, I think you won a couple of other awards as well. Just an absolutely phenomenal at this hackathon. Yeah. Really cool project artist. Fantastic.
01:09:20.314 - 01:10:09.194, Speaker A: The code was really clean. What's next? What are you looking to do now? Well, the next thing is to implement keepers, just continue to develop the project. We have an idea of creating a dow that will enable people to get involved and actually help choosing what is the next charitable organizations we want to pick for the future of our spaceships. So this is what's up for the future. And I invite everyone to just go on the website and look at the white paper. There's going to be a v two version that's going to be available soon. And I just want to give a huge shout out to the team.
01:10:09.194 - 01:10:24.194, Speaker A: So Sox and juicy, they made an awesome work. So props to them. Awesome. Well, thank you so much. Huge congrats to you and your entire team. Really fantastic project. All right, cool.
01:10:24.194 - 01:10:41.640, Speaker A: Well, moving right along here. Just really cool project. Again, if you want to go check it out, go onto the chain link dev post there and play the game right. It's fun. The graphics are really cool. Definitely be sure to check it out. Huge congratulations there.
01:10:41.640 - 01:11:15.762, Speaker A: So where are we at now? What are we doing now? Oh, Defi. Defi. Do people in the chat know what DeFi is? Do we know what DeFi is? I think we do. DeFi, or decentralized finance. This is the project that built a DeFi integration with Chainlink. As a lot of, you know, Chainlink is the backbone for, I want to say, the majority of D five protocols, or a large quantity of D five protocols. I think it's helping secure some like 60, 80 billion total value locked right now, something like that.
01:11:15.762 - 01:11:47.530, Speaker A: So these are the projects that took that and said, we're going to go further. We're going to integrate chain link and DFi as well. This project is going to win $15,000 in link as well. So the DFi project winners are actually two trade board and krypton. We actually had a hard time picking just one. So we ended up doing two, which is going to be trade board and krypton. Huge congrats to both teams.
01:11:47.530 - 01:12:15.654, Speaker A: Both of you are going to win $15,000. So huge congrats. First, we're going to have trade board. Go trade board. Which one is trade board? Looking in my chat here, let me switch back to the stream trade board. Is Mike okay? We have Mike. Mike, is your teammate here too? Hi, Patrick, can you hear me? I can hear you loud and clear.
01:12:15.654 - 01:12:45.018, Speaker A: We can all hear you. My teammate is just listening to us. So thanks for the introduction and choosing us. I can't express how happy and honored I am. I know it's a cliche, but I want to thank my teammate Giri and everyone who helped us during this journey. So without further ado, let's get started. You have probably heard of index funds.
01:12:45.018 - 01:13:36.858, Speaker A: Basically, index funds are a basket of stocks like SNP and in blockchain world, it's a basket of cryptocurrencies which everyone can invest into. But there are some problems with current index funds. They need some kind of management because index funds should always keep a balance between a volume of assets. Let's say we want to always have a ratio of one to five between Ethereum and chain link. And keeping this ratio while allowing everyone to invest and redeem with their favorite asset is a challenge. Okay, I'm seeing that you are showing our project. I'm going to show the slides.
01:13:36.858 - 01:14:33.570, Speaker A: Don't worry. Give me. A secondary challenge is keeping the portfolio balanced while making it easy for the investors to enter and exit. And this is a trade off. You cannot have both at maximum. So we made some kind of index fund with a little bit flexibility. This flexibility allows investors to enter and exit with lowest possible fees, even though they are investing with only one asset.
01:14:33.570 - 01:15:13.738, Speaker A: If they want to invest balance, there would be no fee for them. So we have an example here. We wanted to make a motion graphic, but it was too hard for us. So we made a couple of slides and I'm going to go through them fast. So you can pretend that it's a motion graphic. So we have initialized index fund and as you see, we have token B and C and they are balanced. And anyone can invest in balanced form without any fee.
01:15:13.738 - 01:15:43.490, Speaker A: And he gets his shares, as you can see, or he can redeem his tokens and get the shares back. And it's a real estate. Everyone is happy. Now, let's say someone comes and he only has the coin B. He adds the coin B to the mutual fund and now it's unbalanced. He gets the shares, but he also has to pay a small fee. And this fee goes to a price pool.
01:15:43.490 - 01:16:31.282, Speaker A: And this price pool will incentivize anyone who wants to take opportunity to get these price pool. And by doing that, he will make the mutual fund balanced again. We'll see how it happens. Now, let's say we have an unbalanced index fund and someone comes and redeems the tokens B. Right, and he gets the reward. Or someone can come and add some C to the index fund and it's going to get to the balance form again. Now we have some definition.
01:16:31.282 - 01:17:07.010, Speaker A: It's a slip age and that's the flexibility I talked about. We can set a maximum slipage on an index fund and the index funds portfolio would not go further than this slipage. Okay, let me show the website. It's tradeboard IO. I encourage you to go and check it and give us feedback. I don't know why this image is gone. Okay, we have an index fund here.
01:17:07.010 - 01:18:09.782, Speaker A: I'm going to show how it happens in action. As you can see, the index fund started with some money and someone invested unbalanced and he had to pay some fee, sixty seven cents. And someone else came and redeemed some coins. And because he made the index fund a little bit more balanced, he gets some incentives. As you can see here we have some bigger players who invested and invested and make it first unbalanced and then again balanced. So here it was the idea and we implemented an MVP and we wanted to make it even cross chain using chain link. That's it.
01:18:09.782 - 01:18:53.730, Speaker A: Do you have any questions? Awesome. Thank you so much. Yeah, I feel like I'm saying it over and over again, but all these products are so cool. This is one of these products where I saw this and I was like, oh, I want to use this like ASAP. So I guess that's what going to be my next question. What are your plans on rolling out and moving forward? Okay, as I said, one of the plans is to make it cross chain. Imagine you have an index fund from ten different chains and you only have to invest with one of chains and you instantly access to assets from ten different chains.
01:18:53.730 - 01:19:25.790, Speaker A: And the other one is to apply this idea also to mutual funds. As you can see, we are planning to apply the same idea to mutual funds. So mutual fund. The differentiate between a mutual fund and index fund is that a mutual fund has an active manager who will manage the fund and we also can apply this and reduce the costs of mutual funds. That's it. Love it. Awesome.
01:19:25.790 - 01:19:45.060, Speaker A: Fantastic. Well, thank you. Huge congratulations to you and your teammate, who's listening, who is not sharing. Really fantastic job and really excited to see the future of this project. Thank you. All right, great. And with that, we're going to move on to the other defi winner, which is going to be Krypton, who is also here.
01:19:45.060 - 01:19:51.174, Speaker A: I think it's Michael. You're here. Yes, Michael. Hey, Patrick. Nice to meet you. Yeah, hello. Nice to meet you as well.
01:19:51.174 - 01:20:18.586, Speaker A: And I believe you're sharing your screen. Oh, yeah. So let me just move over to the slides and I'm going to talk a little bit about it and then we get into some questions later on. Awesome. I'm going to stop the camera, if that's okay, and then just talk about it. And so, first of all, I want to say that thank you so much for putting together this hackathons, everyone, the judges, the sponsors, the organizers, these hackathons are really an amazing opportunity for people to learn. That's what I did when I participated in the hackathon, I think six months ago or something in the spring.
01:20:18.586 - 01:20:50.746, Speaker A: I didn't submit anything. Basically, I spent all my time learning about chainlink technology, learning about blockchains and so on and so forth. I'm actually quite recently into blockchains. Took my first validity course in January and realized there's just endless possibilities, endless opportunities. You can build and invent anything you want and nobody could stop you. So blockchains are really a way to solve some of the society's biggest problems. And none of the centralized incumbents can do anything to prevent you from doing what you want to do.
01:20:50.746 - 01:21:36.646, Speaker A: So what I think is that looking back, the landscape, the technological landscape in blockchains just changed significantly in the last couple of years. So if you go back to things like Uniswap, synthetics, other, the first wave of D five protocols, which essentially came out, I think, of 2017, 2018, they didn't have the technology we have today. And so Krypton would not be possible if we did not have high performance blockchains like avalanche, if we did not have chainlink's technology. So Chainlink is quite integral to what we're doing with Krypton. And so Krypton is trying to solve an age old problem, which is that in all of trading, there is losses to toxic traders. So in defi, you know, there's front running sandwich attacks. In classic markets, there's front running, too.
01:21:36.646 - 01:22:15.798, Speaker A: But there's typically something called adverse selection that you trade against someone who knows more than you do. And adverse selection is the reason that bid ask spread exists. So, a market maker doesn't want to be taken advantage of by an informed trader. They put up a bid ask spread and make back the spread from the regular traders, the uninformed traders in amms. That's basically the price impact, or the slippage to some extent. Also, the fees that you pay, like the 30 basis points that are paying uniswap. And what sets blockchains and DFI apart from centralized finance, is that everything is public, right? All the transactions that are going to happen, all the trades that are public.
01:22:15.798 - 01:23:24.102, Speaker A: And so a toxic trader, a hedge fund, a high frequency trader, doesn't even need to pay a retail broker like Robinhood for order flow. They can just look it up publicly, but they need a way to implement their trades. So this leads to a certain race to be the first. And what you see in centralized markets is that HFTs, high frequency traders, try for very low latency, so they go to absurd lengths to just beat everyone else to market, right? So whoever is first will win the price, so to speak, so they will be able to buy or sell the entire quantity that's available at a certain price before everyone else can. And that is in some sense, the fundamental reason that a lot of these toxic trading schemes, like front running, like advertise selection, like sandwich attacks and so on and so forth, they exist because existing trading systems like amms and limit order books, they work on a first come, first serve basis. If you're first, you are able to buy whatever you want at a certain price. If there's a misvaluation, you can just arbitrage to the max.
01:23:24.102 - 01:24:09.766, Speaker A: Now, in decentralized systems, the way this works is to basically collude with a minor. So, in the past, you would have had to set up a mining operation, or you would have had to win a priority gas auction. Now, as of this year, there's something which is called flashbots, and it's essentially, I think, an Airbnb for toxic traders. So they can just rent out space in the next block to arrange existing trades and fill in their own trades the best way they want. And so this toxic trading through flashbots has led to almost three quarters of a billion dollars in value lost to DeFI users. So that's huge. And it's getting bigger and bigger.
01:24:09.766 - 01:24:55.030, Speaker A: There has been exponential growth this year, which is mostly due to the growth in flashboards adoption. Now, as of a few months ago, the growth rate is still exponential, but at a lower rate. That's because you can't grow by more than 100%. So they have to find other ways to grow. If you look at the breakdown by protocol, where are traders losing the most? And it's obvious that it's in DFI, but it's actually in decentralized exchanges. So it's no surprise that most of that happens on amms because they are the most popular protocols and their mechanisms are not very economically efficient. But a significant amount happens on a limit order book, DYDX, which actually did not become very big until a few months ago when they moved to their own L2.
01:24:55.030 - 01:25:32.766, Speaker A: And so this graph is directly from flashboards. They're very open about what they're doing, and it is since the beginning, cumulative, since the beginning of 2020. And so it's quite remarkable that a limit order book is already such a big place where toxic trading takes place. But of course, just like in centralized finance and decentralized finance, limit order books don't protect regular traders. They don't protect the little guy, so to speak. And the little guy can actually not just be retail investors, but they can be pension funds, they can be mutual funds. So you're kind of all paying for the winnings of a few very, very sophisticated, very fast, very well capitalized traders.
01:25:32.766 - 01:26:09.390, Speaker A: So what Krypton tries to do is essentially to level the playing field. So Krypton has a mechanism where a latency advantage simply does not matter. Right. It counts for nothing. And so the way that is implemented is that rather than executing orders or trades in single bursts, like concentrate a certain finite quantity in an infinitesimal point in time, it executes orders as flow over time. And everyone who trades at a certain point in time trades at the same price. So it is very, very difficult to get a speed advantage.
01:26:09.390 - 01:26:33.190, Speaker A: Two orders arriving in the same block, they start at the same point in time. So if you want to be first as a toxic trader, you would have to buy out the entire block on flashbots, which is expensive, and that would only give you a one block. Michael, I know there's a lot to go over for this, but in the interest of time, I'm about finished. Thank you so much, Patrick. Thanks. I was curious if you're going to do a demo. Yeah, no, we're not going to do a demo.
01:26:33.190 - 01:27:05.406, Speaker A: I mean, you can watch the video, you can check it out for yourself, which I actually encourage you to do. So if you have one block time advantage, which is 1 second on avalanche, and your trade goes on for maybe 1000 seconds or something, a thousand blocks, there's not much they can take advantage of. So it doesn't pay for toxic traders to be on Crypton. So in the interest of time, I'm just going to skip that. You can please check out the demo. So I want to say a few words about the protocol architecture. So of course this protocol is, I think, fairly economically efficient.
01:27:05.406 - 01:27:54.366, Speaker A: There's very little that sophisticated traders can do to take advantage of ordinary people, but that comes at the cost of very high computational complexity for the matching engine, for order crossing, so on and so forth. So what we're doing is we are putting all of the computational intensive code off the blockchain and onto decentralized chain link oracle nodes. This way all that the smart contract on chain does is to process transfer of tokens, which is order settlement and kind of update order structs. So it's very, very gas efficient. And once again that's enabled really by the decentralized network and external adapters. And so in Danish for time, I'm not going to go into detail on how this works. It's essentially, I think, a hybrid smart contract we use, you know, just like the Soleil projects.
01:27:54.366 - 01:28:19.430, Speaker A: I was very happy to see that these projects are getting more and more technically sophisticated. There's certainly a lot of opportunity. And so let me just close by saying that if you're interested, if you want to stop being canon fodder for toxic traders, please check us out. Our website is WW dot crypton exchange. We have a testnet which is really just an early proof of concept. So no great graphical user interface. If you want to get in touch with us, join us on Telegram.
01:28:19.430 - 01:28:47.026, Speaker A: Our channel is called Crypton exchange and here's the invite link. So once know, thanks to everyone. Congratulations to the other winners. Thanks Patrick. Awesome. Yeah, I saw this. And for those of you who are kind of like kind of trying to follow along and maybe it's a little bit too technical, basically exchanges get front run a lot and so this is an exchange where you can be protected from a lot of this latency issues, right.
01:28:47.026 - 01:29:18.586, Speaker A: So you're not going to get screwed over using some of these exchanges, which is awesome. It's all powered by kind of this super innovative technology using chainlink as a backbone here. So Michael, so my question for you is simply when can I use this? Oh yeah. So there's still a lot to do. So we want to add some more functionality. We need to get the contracts audited, which is probably a much bigger deal since there's also this off chain code in python, then we need to strike some agreements with node operators. So this is really as decentralized as possible.
01:29:18.586 - 01:29:36.766, Speaker A: That's the promise. My hope is that probably in the first half of 2022, this should be going live. That is incredibly exciting. Incredibly exciting. Well, thank you so much, Michael, for being here. Huge congratulations and really looking forward to the future of your protocol and what you're working on. Thanks, Patrick.
01:29:36.766 - 01:29:49.110, Speaker A: I truly appreciate it. Thank you. Awesome. And so that was another one where he know, you heard him speaking a little bit. He was like, yeah, I kind of showed up to spring. I didn't really know what I was doing. Blockchain's kind of new, and then he just built this better, Dex.
01:29:49.110 - 01:30:18.046, Speaker A: Absolutely insane. Like, in six months, or maybe he's been around solidity a little bit longer, but he's learning solidity. He got into this, and now he's building these amazing protocols. So this is absolutely something that you can do as well. So we have two more prizes, which is dows and the grand prize. However, we have a surprise new category that we introduced a little bit late called the off chain compute. And don't worry if you didn't apply for it.
01:30:18.046 - 01:30:49.610, Speaker A: We basically looked to see what type of off chain compute functionality your projects use. Did they use keepers? Did they use VRF? Did they use some kind of really cool off chain mechanic that does something really unique? And so we added this new category called the off chain compute category. And this was another $15,000 category that we added, but we didn't tell anybody. So, sometimes this happens in hackathons. We add new categories. It is what it is. And the off chain compute winner is going to be the protocol NFT meltdown.
01:30:49.610 - 01:31:01.226, Speaker A: So. NFT meltdown. Congratulations. You also have won $15,000 in link. And I believe you're here. I believe it's Caleb, if I'm not mistaken. I think it's Caleb.
01:31:01.226 - 01:31:08.622, Speaker A: And Caleb. Is there anybody else on your team here? Yeah, we got Vasili, as well. Vasilia. That's right. Okay, great. Let me pull. Hello.
01:31:08.622 - 01:31:15.860, Speaker A: Hello. Welcome. Patrick. Hey, Patrick. How are you? Well, huge. I'm doing fantastic. I'm doing even better, though, now that you're here.
01:31:15.860 - 01:31:30.680, Speaker A: Congrats on your project. Really cool project. Five minutes on the clock to tell us about it. Thank you. What a surprise. All right, let me try and get this going here. I will share my entire screen.
01:31:30.680 - 01:32:03.858, Speaker A: All right. Can you guys see that now? So, yeah. Hey, everyone. My name is Caleb and I'm here with Vasili. We're presenting meltdown, an NFT candle auction platform. On the blockchain. So why did we create another NFT auction platform? Right? There are auction platforms that already exist, and how are they different to existing solutions? Well, back in March of 2021, people auctioned off everydays as an NFT at the Christie's auction house.
01:32:03.858 - 01:32:56.766, Speaker A: If you guys remember, this artwork actually sold for a record breaking $69 million. However, shortly after the auction was finished, billionaire Justin sun claimed that his bid of $79 million was not accepted on the website due to a glitch. But as it was sold on a centralized platform, it's difficult to verify and audit this missing bid. But this might have cost people up to $10 million. And this problem of transparency and auditability on these really expensive and high stakes auctions is what inspired us to make something better. Today, NFTs mostly represent just artwork and digital assets, but we believe that in the future there's no reason why they can't represent the right to any high value property. So this could be land or houses.
01:32:56.766 - 01:33:44.478, Speaker A: So it's quite important that we actually figure out how to sell these things trustlessly and fairly as well. Current on chain systems are inefficient and also vulnerable to front running and MEV extraction. And as we discussed, centralized solutions. Although they're efficient, they have counterparty risk and they're also opaque. So we created meltdown as a fair, efficient and decentralized auction protocol as our solution to the growing needs of NFT buyers and sellers. So the question may be what is a candle auction and how they help us solve this problem. Candle auctions were originally used in the 19th century as a fair way to auction ships.
01:33:44.478 - 01:34:29.450, Speaker A: A candle was lit and bids were placed as the candle burnt down. When the flame went out, the person with the highest bid at the time would win the auction. So we have developed the first NFT candle auction system made possible by Chainlink. Here's how it works. An NFT owner can create an auction and specify the time at which the auction will end, as well as the length of the closing window, so the auction can terminate at any point during that closing window. The actual termination point will be decided retroactively using Chainlink's verifiable random functions. Whoever is the highest bidder at that point will win the NFT.
01:34:29.450 - 01:35:21.066, Speaker A: The loser bids are returned so the users can withdraw them, and the NFT seller collects the highest bid. Candle auctions have several advantages that are especially useful in a blockchain environment. Since nobody knows exactly when the auction will end, nobody can snipe the auction at the last minute and candle auctions are efficient as they finalize in a finite amount of time. Also, meltdown is a non cryptographic auction system, meaning that smart contracts themselves can also place bids on auctions. This means that candle auctions are more fair, more decentralized and more transparent than other types of auctions. So all of these advantages increase confidence for buyers and lead to higher revenues for sellers. So I think we're going to show you a quick live demo of meltdown.
01:35:21.066 - 01:35:43.302, Speaker A: Now. Here you can see it. The DAP is actually live, so you can access it at app nftmelt.org on the coven testnet. As you can see, there are already a few auctions that have been created. These two have already been finalized. And this, yeah, this one over there is still running.
01:35:43.302 - 01:36:22.158, Speaker A: So let's take a look at the one that is still live. Here we go. So this is what an auction page looks like. As you can see, we have the NFT on the left, on the top left, and we've got the bid chart on the right. You can see that we also have two bidders represented by these lines and also down at the very bottom. And the winner will be decided in about 4 hours, 28 minutes and 8 seconds. So the red part in the graph is the closing period we talked about earlier.
01:36:22.158 - 01:36:51.082, Speaker A: And the auction can end at any point in that red section. When the auction ends, the chain link keeper nodes that are watching our contract will generate a random number using Chainlink's VRF service, and this will be used to fairly determine the winner. Awesome. So let's actually try and place a bid on this auction live. Let's see how this goes. So we'll just press add to bid. I've already got some ETH in my coven account and I quite like this NFT.
01:36:51.082 - 01:37:15.174, Speaker A: So I'm going to try and bid 0.1 ETH. I'm going to hit update bid and we can confirm this transaction. Coven has been a little bit funny recently, but let's see if this goes through. We should be able to see that bid pop up on the bid chart here. While that's confirming, shout out to Morales and Dap tools. So those are the two frameworks we use to develop this.
01:37:15.174 - 01:37:46.720, Speaker A: And here we go. So we can see here that we now have. This is us 0.1 E and hopefully we can win this NFT so we bid before the closing window. So this bid is guaranteed to actually count for this auction. Yeah, that pretty much wraps us up in terms of our presentation. Just like to say a massive thanks to Patrick, especially, I think your enthusiasm definitely made this a very enjoyable experience.
01:37:46.720 - 01:38:02.802, Speaker A: As well as everyone in the chainlink discord and the community. Me and Vasili, we actually met in the chainlink discord. So, yeah, we are definitely meltdown. Wouldn't have been possible without all you guys. Yeah, that's it. Thanks a lot. Awesome.
01:38:02.802 - 01:38:22.762, Speaker A: Absolutely fantastic meeting friends in the community. Welcome to blockchain. Welcome to Web three. Absolutely fantastic. Yeah. And this is one of these projects that's really cool, right? Because as you said in the beginning, you were like, oh, we've seen candle auctions before, but this is much more fair and actually truly decentralized. Right.
01:38:22.762 - 01:38:54.790, Speaker A: It's all about truth as opposed to trust. So really cool job here. So it's live on COVID right now. I think you kind of mentioned you were alluding to some next steps. What are those next steps for you here? So the next steps would be l two, of course. Everyone loves lower fees, faster transactions, and in addition to that, just getting the contracts to the point of being really compatible with other protocols. Interoperable.
01:38:54.790 - 01:39:13.338, Speaker A: Awesome. Absolutely. Well, huge congrats once again, congratulations on winning the super secret new surprise category. Yeah. Thank you, Patrick. And really excited to see what you both do in the future and really excited to see the future of this project. Awesome.
01:39:13.338 - 01:39:37.806, Speaker A: Have a good evening. You too. These products are so sick. They're so cool. They're all so cool. And they all do fantastic things and they provide these services and they give more and more and more utility to this world that we absolutely love and we need to make a build a better future. So we have two left, two projects left, Dow, and then the grand prize.
01:39:37.806 - 01:40:17.246, Speaker A: And I know the people behind stage, I didn't tell them who wins, so they're a little bit nervous as to what's going to win what? So let me jump back to the stream real quick. I guess this will be a quick screen anyways. But the Dow winner, the winner of the Dow protocol, another $15,000 prize in link token goes to the Governor C project. I'm really excited to hear Governor C talk because when I saw this, I lost my mind. I was like, this is super cool. The governorcy team here. Team is here.
01:40:17.246 - 01:40:40.114, Speaker A: I'm going to be grabbing them, adding them to stream here. I think this is the team. I think it's the three of you. Am I missing anybody or did I add somebody incorrectly? It's okay. I'm going to present. Perfect. Well, welcome to the stream and huge congrats.
01:40:40.114 - 01:41:12.286, Speaker A: Oh, my God. It's a really great honor to present today. Yeah, hi, this is Ellen park, the member of Team governor C and we have four members in our team including me. So other team members are Sangham Park, Ingen King and Jumuli. And all of them are really good blockchain developers. So in this project, in this hackathon, our team developed a smart contract named Governor C. So this is a fully decentralized CB resistant quadrialtic voting system based on Chainlink VRF.
01:41:12.286 - 01:42:04.580, Speaker A: So recently, as you all know, Dao has emerged as an innovative organization system for the healthy community governance. And our team believes this is a new governance system for the coming web3 ecosystem. The key for building successful DAO is making fair governance systems so lots of community members can make their voices and lead the group to the better direction to build better dow environment. Many Dow participants try to develop governance voting system in better way. So quadratic voting method which make codes of purchasing tickets increase exponentially has emerged to compensate for the weakness of existing methods like $1.01 vote. However, this alternative, this new method is also exposed to risk of civil attack.
01:42:04.580 - 01:42:56.610, Speaker A: By creating multiple accounts, several voters with bad intentions can show inappropriate voting power. So our team would like to suggest improved voting system smart contract governor C this is a fully decentralized civil resistance quadrialtic voting system based on Chainlink VRF. So we are going to release this smart contract as an open source to make our solution fully decentralized. We use a lot of existing blockchain services as you can see on the screen, to make CB resistance quadritic voting system. We suggest a new voting method called probabilitic quadritic voting. So in this hackathon, in this chainlink hackathon, we developed three things. First, the PQV method to improve existing quadrialtic voting system.
01:42:56.610 - 01:43:47.662, Speaker A: Second, voting contract system called Governor C based on PQV method and Chainlink VRF. Last, we built a service by using governor C contracts we developed. So first, PQV is a civil resistance quadrialtic voting system. This team developed this method make it always a loose to do CB attack by applying probabilitic element and quadratic voting. So this team did a simulation based on pareto distribution. High similarity with quadratic voting and CB resistance have proved and we also found the most optimal hyperparameter based on the simulation. The Governor C Charlie is a smart contract for voting system based on PQV.
01:43:47.662 - 01:44:52.518, Speaker A: We suggested we use Chainlink VRF to implement the probability factor of PQV to make this open source solution more scalable. This contract follows the compound governance module standard which is one of the most widely used standard in DAO ecosystem. Even the biggest DaO service, Sushiswap follows this standard. Current DAOs using compound module based on governor B can easily apply our new solution, governor C which is developed under the same standard. Finally, we develop a service based on the Governor C smart contract. So by providing the scalable and decentralized open source solution, the goal of our team is to activating the entire DaO ecosystem based on fair decision making system. So before we conclude our presentation, finish our presentation, we want to show next steps of our project.
01:44:52.518 - 01:45:38.934, Speaker A: First, we are going to upgrade our governor c contract to the next level. Our open source project improved compound governance module Governor B based on PQV and Chainlink VRF. So this team is going to study other methods which could be Governor D to improve governance system. Second, this project wants to expand the uses of PQV to other areas. We show the demo which apply governor C contract on governance. So our demo is on the devil website. So we want to use PQV in several other areas like quadratic funding, quadratic ranking and also quadratic attention payment.
01:45:38.934 - 01:46:24.626, Speaker A: So due to the time constraint, we just delivered just simple ideas about our project. So if you want to see detailed information about our project, you can check our dev website. So in the website you can check the demo video and also our detailed code about the governance C. So this is the end of our team governance C's presentation. So thank you a lot for listening and thank you a lot for all of the sponsors and organizers of Chainlink Hackathon. Thank you and thank you so much for participating. Yeah, this was one of those products that I looked at this and I was like, wait, what are they trying to do? And then I was just blown away.
01:46:24.626 - 01:47:04.340, Speaker A: I was like, okay, all my dao tutorials are now useless. I need to revamp everything so I can use this new governor c contract to make them even fair, even better. So that's actually going to my question here. When can we start putting these in tutorials? Does it make sense for us to wait for Delta for the next one? I know for those of you who are watching, they have like a UI where you can kind of go through the service doing it. Should we wait for Governor Delta? Is Governor C good to go? What are your thoughts? Also, also after the hackathon we are going to develop more about Governor C. So it might take about one to two months. Yeah.
01:47:04.340 - 01:47:30.620, Speaker A: Awesome. So building governors need to be even cooler. Okay. So we need to connect soon so we can talk about getting this in the hand to all the dows in the space so they can have provably fairer, cheaper, just better governance. Really exciting and some big brain stuff here. So thank you so much for being here. Huge congratulations on your $15,000 prize and just building this really cool thing here.
01:47:30.620 - 01:47:48.430, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. Awesome work. All right, so that means. Well, actually, just another huge shout out there. I want to get my hands on that. I need Governor C adapted. Toros in 2022 are all going to be Governor C.
01:47:48.430 - 01:48:23.580, Speaker A: That's the plan. So with that being said, this means, I think we are at almost the end of the closing ceremony. This means there's one project left. This means there's the grand prize winner left. This is the project that we thought was just kind of showed the ultimate chain linkiness, the hackathoniness. It's just an absolutely phenomenal project here. We are so excited to show to you what the grand prize is.
01:48:23.580 - 01:49:09.080, Speaker A: Who won the grand prize here, and let me pull this off, I've got a little drum roll thing that I wanted to play, but I already kind of ruined it by showing the video. So the grand prize winner of the chain link hackathon 2021 fall edition is. Drumroll, please. The music team. $30,000 in link token to the music team for their music bonds. And they are all here. I'm going to pull them on stage, pulling you all on stage, one by one.
01:49:09.080 - 01:49:20.560, Speaker A: Hello. You're all here. Welcome, grand prize winners. Music thank you. You were backstage for, like, an hour. Appreciate the wait. Yeah.
01:49:20.560 - 01:49:59.640, Speaker A: And that was also. We just met for the first. The whole team just met for the first time immediately prior to jumping into the green room. Amazing. So you just met. How did you coordinate? How did you talk before? Mean, five different time zones, right? So we've got rob in Philadelphia, so I'm in the UK, and Zeeshan's in Karachi in Pakistan. Lagesh is in Chennai in India, and Sharon's in Melbourne in.
01:49:59.640 - 01:50:19.854, Speaker A: Insane. Insane. But we kind of stuck to a more like, Asia centric time zone. And then Rob was able to. We. Lagesh also met Rob together and he was able to contribute kind of without attending the regular standups. Right.
01:50:19.854 - 01:50:41.960, Speaker A: So we were doing basically daily standups throughout the hackathon. Awesome. Absolutely. And for those of you who came to the speed coding event, yes, that is sean as well. Clearly he was a phenomenal coder there, and they built a phenomenal project. So just huge congrats to all five of you. Just really cool project here.
01:50:41.960 - 01:51:22.082, Speaker A: Let's go ahead. And give you the floor and tell the world about what you built. Great. Yeah. And thank you so much, Patrick, and thanks for the whole, I mean, thank you so much to chainlink. I think the validation here, this is a vote for the future of music, right? I think that musicians have been left out in the cold by the industry for so long and this is music coming back, baby. Napster kind of cannibalized the industry somewhat, but it gave us all access to all of the music in the world.
01:51:22.082 - 01:52:37.990, Speaker A: Right? And our vision is that web3 music is a foundational building block of web3 as an asset that has real value that we all love. Here we go. This is us NFT music bonds, and we're enabling the creation of non fungible music bonds to empower artists with financial freedom. So there's actually more money locked in DFI than every music streaming service in the entire industry made in 2020. So our vision and what we're doing is building the decentralized infrastructure to power the next generation of music, enabling music rights owners to get financing from their future income, and establishing digital music as a building block of web3. So what does that mean? Well, we're here with the music bonds. So David Bowie back in 1997, was not only like musical, musical pioneer, but he pioneered the Bowie bonds.
01:52:37.990 - 01:53:14.040, Speaker A: And this was an instrument that packaged up, I think, 26 of his albums. And then he issued them as a bond for $55 million and those sold to prudential insurance. And this enabled David Bowie to buy back the rights to his music. So 50% of his music was owned by his former manager. Right. And by issuing this bond, he was able to go and buy back his music. So it's getting late for me here anyway, so here we go.
01:53:14.040 - 01:53:58.506, Speaker A: This is the demo. So you can choose a marketplace. And we've conceived this as a chain agnostic standard. So for now, we've just zeroed in on. You can, you can go through to mint on opensea and now I'm just going to give a shout out to the audience or Patrick or whoever. Can you guys give us an artist? Who do you want us to demo? Right, I'm watching YouTube now in the comments, so if anybody wants to shout out an artist, then we can test it out, we can try it out live, we can see how the. Okay, it's print.
01:53:58.506 - 01:54:37.234, Speaker A: Okay, that's. It's on. Cool. So this is where as an artist, you put in your NFT bond information. And basically what we're going to do is we're going to set this up so you need to validate this through your Spotify for artists account. So I'm just going to search for Prince here and. Yeah, this is Prince, but what we need is Prince's ID.
01:54:37.234 - 01:54:57.914, Speaker A: Right. So we're going to have. That's him there, isn't it? There we go. Cool. I've got kind of an interesting set up here. So here you go. So we pull out Prince's ID and we can stick this in the Spotify artist ID here.
01:54:57.914 - 01:55:30.600, Speaker A: Right? And you see it's pulled up his monthly Spotify listeners straight away. And let's search for print. Print. There you go. It. Here we go. So we're going to grab the URL from print and boom.
01:55:30.600 - 01:56:01.246, Speaker A: And we're going to give it a name. Let's call it print and a symbol. Well, what was that? Oh, it doesn't have a. Let's just go. I think we've got my YouTube is just playing the music. Right. So what you can do as an artist, you can come in and you can provide a collateral deposit.
01:56:01.246 - 01:57:02.606, Speaker A: And this collateral deposit enables the engine to rate the bond based on the number of listeners and it's a median of the number of listeners and the number of subscribers. So I'm just going to go in here and I'm going to add, let's go for one e and let's look at the individual bond value. So we can use this to determine the amount of bonds, individual bonds that are issued. Right. So rather than setting up like a fractionalized NFT, we've set this up so it can be minted as a collection. So we're actually going to be minting individual NFTs. This is because we started off minting on Opensea and it's just nice to be able to see everything as a collection.
01:57:02.606 - 01:57:48.610, Speaker A: Right. So I'd just like to hand over to Sharon, who was responsible for this fantastic UI and UX design, and maybe she can talk a bit about her process. Yeah. Thanks, Adam. So for the UI, we drew inspiration from the image that we had on the landing page for branding and color and use existing UI design systems like material UI for quick prototyping. And for the UX, it was an iterative process for the team. We made many changes along the way as we needed to adapt to how Dapps function, such as waiting for transactions to be processed and waiting for on chain data to come back and then displaying it for our users.
01:57:48.610 - 01:58:41.650, Speaker A: Besides getting their input, as we can see before, we needed users to also connect their wallets at the right time. So we didn't want it to be premature. As you can see, we didn't connect. We will connect a bit later on in the next step when we deposit the collateral. We wanted it to be a seamless and logical process as everything in blockchain will eventuate to some sort of monetary involvement. We wanted the experience to be trust filled and more straightforward for potential mainstream users. Yeah, thanks Adam and Sharon.
01:58:41.650 - 01:59:35.858, Speaker A: We have started out setting up a chain link node with XML adapters to take advantage of this online request for YouTube and Spotify data. So collateral pool, or an asset pool, is the contract where an artist will transfer the collateral amount for every quarter starting with first quarter collateral amount deposits. Right now, the collateral amount could be calculated from the revenue of these YouTube and Spotify page streaming service that you saw in the previous page. The collateral deposit is necessary. Here, artist determines the rating for the bond. So rating and dynamics will be explained by Sean in the next module. But yeah, once the asset pool is set up, artists can then mint NFT bonds as per their number of bonds configuration.
01:59:35.858 - 02:00:37.058, Speaker A: Once these NFT metadata are stored on IPFs and pinned to Pinata, the art for the NFT will be available on Opensea for the fans or the investors to join the collection. Now I would like to invite Jisan to explain the further process in detail. Okay, so basically, when artist is done with the depositing the funds and the minting of the bond, what our bond do is our NFT bond draws the streaming data from external sources like YouTube and Spotify using the chainlink's oracle. So we are using Chainlink Oracle to extract the data from the different external sources. And that data is being used by our rating engine, which actually applies the rating on NFT bond. Generally when you go in the financial market and see a bond, you see the rating of a bond. And that rating identifies either that bond is an investment grade bond or a speculative bond.
02:00:37.058 - 02:01:32.780, Speaker A: Or the riskier the bond is, the speculative the bond is, the lower the rating is, the higher the interest rate you will get. So that's how the complete process is being built. And for that, what we need to do is basically we need to collect data or information from all different sources, which is external service like YouTube and Spotify. That needs to be done in a decentralized way. So our idea is the plan and what you say final implementation is to create a complete decentralized oracle network for music streaming data like Chenlink is doing for Ethereum price or different cryptocurrency prices. So prices are coming from 30 different sources for the Ethereum and then they got aggregated at a single place. From that single place.
02:01:32.780 - 02:02:16.162, Speaker A: When you get the pricing feed, you get the data which is coming from 30 different sources. So it is not a single source, it is decentralized. So this is what we trying to do with music, that we are getting the streaming data from different multiple sources, and we will aggregate it in a single place. And then the NFT bond and the rating engine will use that information for that. We had did the quite bit of digging into how Chainlink is aggregating using the flux aggregator and the OCR. So we actually had to implement flux aggregator by ourselves, obviously using the chainlinks implementation, but it was the previous version of implementation. So we tried to implement.
02:02:16.162 - 02:03:24.720, Speaker A: But definitely we will need chainlinks team help to finalize and implement in a production. So that this needs to be done with the help, because it's not supported out of the box. So Chainlink teams will be helping us in integrating and creating this off chain reporting for these systems, and that these will be integrated into our rating, the DAO and the NFTs, and all this information will be coming here. So complete decentralized network for the, what you say, streaming data, which will be additional category for chain link as well. That's completely protocol how we work. Okay, so I worked on the visual representations of the actual NFT bonds. And after some brainstorming, we thought that it would be appropriate to use fractals to represent our idea.
02:03:24.720 - 02:04:57.130, Speaker A: Because at their essence, a fractal, the visuals are really just driven by the numbers and the formulas underneath them. So we thought it would be appropriate to use the same concept here, in that the various iterations of these bonds are driven by what the artist chooses and how many streams they're getting, and basically all the numbers and the data underneath them. The challenge, of course, was to come up with a way to visualize this, because an actual fractal is very complex. So we came up with a simplified version using just a simple piece of music notation, in this case, just a treble clef. I basically created something that's representative of a fractal based on a treble clef. And our idea is to represent the different levels of bond collateralization using a color scheme, with red being bond that would be like a D rating that isn't very collateralized. And then as it transitions to green, a green bond would be one that is fully collateralized.
02:04:57.130 - 02:05:47.540, Speaker A: And we were also playing with the idea of using a pixelation mechanic to further exemplify that. And it's also a subtle nod to the whole crypto punk NFT pop culture thing. And so we're still sort of tweaking this and fine tuning it. But the final version of this would be what you see on the right or something like it, which will be a cool little animated fractal that will sort of spin and vibe with the artist. Music. Awesome. Yeah, thanks.
02:05:47.540 - 02:06:24.670, Speaker A: I've just been going through. I just took you out of kind of the permissions hell, but we're still on this demo. But I'm just getting to issuing the NFT bond itself. And just so you guys. There we go. Just so you guys can understand the rating engine and what the bond ratings mean. This is basically inspired by the work of Moody's and standard and pause.
02:06:24.670 - 02:07:24.450, Speaker A: And basically by calculating the median of the Spotify and YouTube, the Spotify listeners and the YouTube subscribers, then all of the A ratings reach the investment grade. And these are all over collateralized. Right. So the point is we've kind of taken these ratings that are recognized as a standard in the traditional finance world and adapted them for DeFi, right. So by over collateralizing, then we're basically sure that the repayment is going to happen for the NFT holders. And then the other ratings, actually these are based on. This is based on the Sanskrit vowel Alphabet.
02:07:24.450 - 02:08:14.866, Speaker A: So treble I and the I ratings are for a speculative U and are also speculative, but still a cool asset to hold. Right. And there's a market for junk bonds in itself. So yeah, I've got through and I've just got some of these available and let's have a look. So you can see that we've got the various ratings available and this is how they're visualized. And we take these right through to Opensea. And you can see them listed on OpenseA as well.
02:08:14.866 - 02:09:15.294, Speaker A: Right. But I think for the consideration of time, I'm just going to pull up what's next for music. Basically, there were a lot of really cool ideas going on in the hackathon itself. And I think at the beginning we were thinking it was going to be more about building out the Oracle network itself and spoofing the Oracle network, which we could have burnt like a hell of a lot of time on. And we did burn a hell of a lot of time on. But then through some advice from Zach, we ended up just using the NeAPI function to bring the data into the contracts. And towards the end we realized that really the next step is the yield maximizer and enabling these artists and the holders to maximize their yield through DFI protocols.
02:09:15.294 - 02:09:47.600, Speaker A: Right. So initially we were looking at sushi and we were looking at the bento box protocol, but then doing a bit more digging and looking at some of the concepts from DFI 2.0 and setting up a community owned Dow that's enabled to incorporate a music backed rebasing currency. So right now, even the best D five 2.0 projects are still backed by Dai, for example. Right? So still being beholden to the fed. Right.
02:09:47.600 - 02:10:44.302, Speaker A: Whereas if through the Dow, we can purchase an evergreen catalog from a legacy artist, then this can be used to back the currency itself in order to ensure a floor price. Right. So immediate next steps, minting a genesis bond, which is the first bond, the first NFT bond with an established artist, and getting this Dow going. Right. So really just thank you so much to chainlink. It's been an amazing opportunity and we've all learned so much. And I really take my hat off to the idea of truth and transparency and being able to introduce this to the music industry is so overdue.
02:10:44.302 - 02:11:03.042, Speaker A: So it's really my honor to be here today. And Patrick, I salute you. And I think the rest of music, we are all stoked. Absolutely. Well, I'm absolutely stoked. Thank you all so much for being here. And I know we gave you a little bit more than five minutes here because you're the grand prize winner.
02:11:03.042 - 02:11:38.466, Speaker A: Why not? Phenomenal job. I saw this and the first thing I thought I was like, oh, so this is like Defi meets music, but also kind of wrapped in this really cool way. I mean, the fact that you had the bonds be nfts and you can see them on OpeNC, I thought was really creative. Right. Because that's like a way for bringing a lot of people into this space. Right. One of the biggest challenges that we as a web3 community are facing is just how do we get more people into the space? How do we get more people to understand the space? And using something like an NFT, where you have that piece of art, it makes it a little bit easier to visualize what's going on now.
02:11:38.466 - 02:12:07.318, Speaker A: It's not some random contract on chain. Okay. My bond is kind of this image, I thought that was really creative. Having the investment grade, having the different ratings in the bonds, I thought was brilliant. It's a perfect use of chain to bring in this new kind of rating estimator, which is totally transparent, which is phenomenal. Bring all this data in to kind of create this new defi vehicle. Absolutely blew us away.
02:12:07.318 - 02:12:44.866, Speaker A: Fantastic protocol. You pretty much laid out your next steps and kind of what you've done. And I know I spoke to Zeeshan really briefly over the duration of the hackathon. I feel like I don't have any questions because you all went through anything. I mean, I'm just crazy stoked. You all did phenomenally. Are there any last things that you all want to say before we jump off here? Well, I just like to say that I think that in some ways, this whole hackathon, this project, is like a proposal for Chainlink.
02:12:44.866 - 02:13:30.950, Speaker A: Right? Can we crunch music streaming data? We need music streaming data for our bonds. Let us crunch music streaming data. I think you guys agreed that this is the next step for Chainlink, and I think this is the next step for the web. That's all I wanted to say. And it's just been fantastic to get to know you over the course of the hackathon and, yeah, I mean, I just can't wait to roll this out properly in 2022. And please join up. Join our discord.
02:13:30.950 - 02:13:41.130, Speaker A: Get on Twitter, all of the good stuff. Music FM. It's there. You're welcome. Right. This is a community. This is for the community.
02:13:41.130 - 02:14:08.194, Speaker A: This is dedicated to transparency in music, and we are moving the industry forward. So please join us. Awesome. Well, thank you all so much. Absolutely phenomenal job here. I'm going to slowly close you off one by one because that's all I can do. But really excited to see everything the rest of you all do know just one more time.
02:14:08.194 - 02:14:30.314, Speaker A: Congratulations. Thank you. And thank you for channeling, for providing all this support and the ecosystem for this hackathon and everything. That's to channeling. And you guys, and especially Patrick, you were super crazy doing managing the hackathon. You were a savior for us. We were stuck into a lot of issues.
02:14:30.314 - 02:14:47.070, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you so much. I'm glad the tutorials were helpful to. Excellent. All right, well, slowly going to pull you off one by one. Oh, my goodness. What a ride.
02:14:47.070 - 02:15:07.270, Speaker A: So that is the conclusion of the chain link. Fall 2021 hackathon. Absolutely phenomenal. Phenomenal team music. They built something really innovative there, right? Like, that's a crazy innovative product. It's this music meets d five meets nfts. Absolutely phenomenal.
02:15:07.270 - 02:15:45.010, Speaker A: So, sadly, this means the hackathon has indeed come to a close. But the good thing is that's really just the beginning of a new chapter. Right? All these projects are wide eyed and the future is ahead of them and they're striving for it, really. This is kind of the beginning for a lot of these projects, and we are all glued to the screens, excited to see what they come out with next. Excited to see the future of blockchain because these are the engineers that are building the future, right? It's you, you who is here. You're building the future. You're part of the community.
02:15:45.010 - 02:16:18.202, Speaker A: Those of you who aren't building anything, you're a part of the community. You're a part of this future that's being ushered in by events like these. And I just want to give a huge thank you once again to everybody who attended this hackathon, who showed up for the closing ceremony, who maybe even just jumped to the discord, say hello. Maybe you just answered a stack overload question. Maybe you wrote some code that somebody used. Thank you. There's a massive community of friends, a massive community of people who are building this better future, who are building this kind of insane highway to this new world.
02:16:18.202 - 02:16:38.354, Speaker A: So huge. Thank you. Thank you so much for being with us on this hackathon journey. Can't wait to see where people go. And with that being said, I think that just means. Until next time, my friends. Looking forward to seeing you all in the next hackathon, in the next event.
02:16:38.354 - 02:16:42.640, Speaker A: Looking forward to see what everybody builds. Take care, everybody, and good night.
