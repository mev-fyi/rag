00:00:00.570 - 00:00:21.200, Speaker A: Cool. Well, we'll go ahead and get started then. Amazing. So for everyone tuning in, we are doing Chainlink live today with depot. We have TJ here today, so let's go ahead and jump in. Yeah. What is depot? What have you guys been doing that makes you so special?
00:00:21.570 - 00:00:47.980, Speaker B: Heck yeah. So depot is a multi market aggregator and not just like one facet of the market. We aggregate everything from sexes to Dex protocols to NFT marketplaces and all blockchains and L2s. And I honestly just think what we're doing is really exciting. I think we're bringing a fresh, new feel to the space and there's just a major use case for sure.
00:00:49.150 - 00:00:59.760, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. And I know when I was looking at your site and everything, you really focused on encouraging new users to jump into defi. So how is depot helping new people in this space?
00:01:00.130 - 00:01:33.580, Speaker B: So our community is honestly really special. Every single person there, it doesn't matter if you just heard about crypto, period. If you're in that group, we're going to help you out. And honestly, it's really great how supportive our community is. And then just past that, we have all kinds of guides, all kinds of moderators that will help you out as well. And I mean, just hitting critical mass, that's what we want to do with depot. Our product is focused around that and our community has definitely been helping there as well.
00:01:33.950 - 00:02:14.850, Speaker C: Something interesting about crypto space, especially in the last year or two, is as NFTs have taken off, communities are this really core part of spreading the word and helping people understand. Having a solid discord sets projects apart. That's pretty different from fintech, right? Like PayPal, it was just like, does it work? Does it talk to my needs to, I just need to be able to figure out how it works. And I could never figure out how it worked anyways, but that's kind of a major difference, like having that community in place. Is that something you guys knew from the onset, like, okay, we got to get this set up, we got to be super welcoming? Or did that emerge as people kind of found your protocol?
00:02:15.010 - 00:02:44.478, Speaker B: So I sort of knew that from the onset and I wanted to build my community out. But just as we evolved, we started to really attract people just because of the word of mouth around our project. And that's when we really started to scale our community, and especially our interns and moderators. And from that you can just kind of see the culture that has emerged out of everything we've been doing. And it's been amazing. People are super supportive of each other, so love to see it.
00:02:44.644 - 00:02:54.014, Speaker C: I see. One question. How do you get to the discord? Zaji, I'm going to let you take over. I'm going to go find the link to the discord and get it in the YouTube link so that people can find it. I'll be right back.
00:02:54.132 - 00:03:09.498, Speaker A: I'll drop that in. Yeah, you already can see there's so much community we have, like hashtag depot. We have depot community vibing in the discord. So yeah, this is going to be a fun one. It sounds like your community is super stoked, which I love. Yeah, amazing.
00:03:09.584 - 00:03:10.346, Speaker B: I love it.
00:03:10.448 - 00:03:20.798, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So talking more about depot, are there any arbitrage opportunities between centralized and decentralized platforms that depot can identify to date?
00:03:20.884 - 00:03:22.400, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, for sure.
00:03:22.770 - 00:03:23.840, Speaker A: Jumping, right?
00:03:24.530 - 00:04:02.730, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's actually in our back end currently and we're developing the UI right now, but there's absolutely going to be one click arbitrage opportunities. Since we're already pulling in all these data feeds and these prices from CFI, DeFI, even NFT marketplaces, we might as well throw arbitrage opportunities on top and then guide the entire user through the process with that one click, charge a fee and share revenue with their users. So we're absolutely going to take advantage of that. And I think we're going to see the initial version of that here within the next two months, hopefully.
00:04:03.470 - 00:04:09.226, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah, that'd be good to know what you've been working on over the past quarter or so, just so everybody can.
00:04:09.248 - 00:04:10.640, Speaker B: Get a lot.
00:04:12.530 - 00:04:13.550, Speaker A: Highlights.
00:04:13.970 - 00:04:47.490, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So we just came out with mobile compatibility. Our bridge is just about to come out. Bonds are just about to come out. Really pioneering the space there. We're going to have a two layer system with bonds, which is going to be amazing. And then as far as the sexes that we've aggregated, those have just come out recently, we've done a UI overhaul and now we're doing a refactoring on the back end, which is going to make the platform like two, three times even faster or two, three times faster.
00:04:47.490 - 00:04:52.486, Speaker B: And there's just a ton going on.
00:04:52.588 - 00:05:03.342, Speaker A: No, and that's a good point too, talking about being faster and everything with gas fees. How have you been addressing that on the depot side? To make sure that you guys are being the fastest as you can be in this space for sure.
00:05:03.396 - 00:05:43.100, Speaker B: So we're already utilizing you guys in the back end, which has definitely helped us, but then we're taking advantage of current liquidity pools. So uniswap one inch we access the same liquidity. And as far as gas fees, I mean we're on average like 30% to 40% cheaper than most people in the market with the same rate of finality. I think right now it takes 1015 seconds for our swaps to go through with that cheaper gas fee. And yeah, I'd say we're definitely leading the market in some aspects there.
00:05:43.870 - 00:05:44.620, Speaker A: Nice.
00:05:45.390 - 00:05:54.522, Speaker C: A super technical question. Is ginger ale your go to? I like that you're drinking. Yeah, I just don't see it all the time. It's fantastic.
00:05:54.586 - 00:05:57.950, Speaker B: Is that okay? I don't want to do like any product placement.
00:06:01.090 - 00:06:03.600, Speaker C: I'm a verner's man myself, but.
00:06:06.370 - 00:06:09.598, Speaker A: I have a green juice. So yeah, we're all in the same boat.
00:06:09.694 - 00:06:27.186, Speaker C: I'm going to shout out this community again. There's a ton of people here. People are hyped to be there. I dropped the link in the chat. If you need to find the discord link, you can refresh the video and it'll be down in the description. Now I dropped it in there as, oh, we got a great audience question. Can we do this one? Saji?
00:06:27.218 - 00:06:28.426, Speaker A: Yeah, I see it right here.
00:06:28.448 - 00:06:34.780, Speaker C: Right, right. If you could describe depot in five words, what would those words be?
00:06:36.510 - 00:06:45.710, Speaker B: Transparency, accessibility, prosperity, variability and generosity.
00:06:46.370 - 00:06:59.026, Speaker C: Exciting. Those are really cool. Play it safe sometimes too. Fantastic. You got some fans in here as well. We got romaine in here helping out as well. Romaine, I see you.
00:06:59.026 - 00:07:02.180, Speaker C: Thanks for moderating. That's awesome. Appreciate having you here.
00:07:02.710 - 00:07:03.700, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:07:04.470 - 00:07:10.518, Speaker A: Great. And you were talking about how you're using Chainlink in the background. Let's jump into that. Yeah. How are you guys using Chainlink in.
00:07:10.524 - 00:07:49.140, Speaker B: Your product for sure? So Chainlink is going to power a lot of our product because since we're aggregating all these different data feeds and prices around the market, we need a baseline. We need someone that can say what the market average is and truly have that be completely accurate. So whenever users are searching for a certain asset, they're able to see how far above or below the market it is and then from there they're able to see what's competitive and how much money they're going to save. And honestly, I'm really grateful for being able to integrate with you guys. It's going to be huge whenever we release that for sure.
00:07:50.950 - 00:08:10.890, Speaker C: I'm curious, you're an aggregator across L2s and chains. What are these L2s? How does that work? Are you off chain and then you pull and kind of do all this? How does that aggregation work for you. She's got to take a break for a sec. Her dog is having an adventure. So pardon her, but this is real. This is live. You all.
00:08:10.890 - 00:08:13.738, Speaker C: That's all you know. That's all you know. Not a pre record.
00:08:13.904 - 00:08:49.700, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, currently our process right now is just looking at where the users are, where the volume is in the market. And that's kind of how we're targeting the l two s that we're bringing on right now. We have polygon, arbitrum. Arbitrum is going to be coming soon and then we're targeting several others. It's essentially like up to our community. We stay really active asking people what they're on, what they want to see depot on, and then from there we aggregate that. Not a super technical answer, but that's right.
00:08:50.890 - 00:09:04.362, Speaker C: What about your team? Part of your sort of value is you're fully doxed. You got a fully doxed team. I've seen your team page on your homepage. Who are the folks building that besides TJ? People love TJ, by the way. You got TJ fans in here.
00:09:04.496 - 00:09:32.100, Speaker B: I love you. You know, we have a massive team and honestly it's been amazing. I'd say the people on our team are definitely servants. There's just tons of generosity and they're giving a lot of their time to the project. Our Coo, George, he's been amazing. Been with me for almost the whole time. Hank Ashley, marketing he's been doing a great job.
00:09:32.100 - 00:10:10.894, Speaker B: Alex Hong, our CTO and then just all the developers that we brought on have just been an amazing part of the team. Recently we onboarded Henry, which I'm not sure if we could drop the link here in the chat, but he's been amazing. He's overseen like 150 Fortune 500 developers in his career. He's published several academic papers. He's been really helping us build out our back end and just our community too. I consider our community part of our team. They've been amazing and they've been spreading this project like fire.
00:10:10.894 - 00:10:13.840, Speaker B: So it's been great.
00:10:14.770 - 00:10:53.120, Speaker C: I want to dig into a little bit of aggregators and where aggregators are in the market and in market cycles. In 2019, no one ever heard of a DFI aggregator as a term. In 2020, kind of yearn blew it up as a place where like, okay, well, we can do different sort of yield farming things on behalf of other people in a decentralized way. But then after yearn there were a bunch of sort of competitors or different kinds of offerings, different sort of things. And that DFI boom in 2020, attention has waned, the total value locked has increased. Right. It's just kind of still gone bonkers for sure.
00:10:53.120 - 00:11:03.826, Speaker C: What's the value in a new aggregator or a newer project? Do you have a new take on things? Are people just looking for different experiences? Where do aggregators fit right now?
00:11:04.008 - 00:11:42.870, Speaker B: So I'd say we definitely have a new take on things. And we're not necessarily just an aggregator. Every single aspect of the platform I want to build to be without peer. And the way we do that is we aggregate like 99% of the volume. So like finance, top five centralized exchanges and then we're going to come out with a sex in the future that can meet the best prices in the market and cut the fee. Same thing with the dexes, same thing with NFT marketplaces. I know when we launch we're going to have opensea rarible, looks rare, nifty, like everything aggregated.
00:11:42.870 - 00:12:16.440, Speaker B: But then we're going to have an oracle on top of that to where people are able to arbitrage NFTs. People can have all kinds of data attached to the NFTs and then just what powers the platform in general? There's going to be a dashboard where you can access everything within three clicks. And the tokenomics behind our token, you're literally paid to hold it. Over 50% of the revenue generated by our platform will be airdropped and hand delivered to every single person that holds depot. And then depot itself will be pegged to an index of bitcoin gold. And the.
00:12:20.090 - 00:12:30.090, Speaker C: You got, you got a lot going on. And it's more than an aggregator. It sounds like a full product roadmap. Daji's back. You can jump in when you're.
00:12:33.470 - 00:12:35.740, Speaker A: Know, we love working from home.
00:12:36.110 - 00:12:38.022, Speaker C: Yeah, it's reality.
00:12:38.086 - 00:12:40.240, Speaker B: I know how it's good.
00:12:40.610 - 00:12:47.074, Speaker A: It sounds like you guys were getting into some stuff. Have we also seen any other questions come through from the community? Let's see what's going on in here.
00:12:47.112 - 00:13:13.500, Speaker C: You look for there. Sorry, I was going back to my question as well. So you've got a lot of these different kinds of products. You're building out the team. Oh, a centralized exchange. That's what I want to talk about is like you have this vision of building your own centralized exchange. Where's that domicile? Or is that still like a roadmap thing yet? And you guys are still figuring it out.
00:13:13.500 - 00:13:44.946, Speaker C: The reason I'm asking is it's a really interesting, we've seen FTX, they're a centralized exchange. They're regulated around the world, and then they kind of have their fingers in a bunch of defi projects that they're closely related to binance. Same thing. Right. Okay, well, once let's launch, they launch binance chain and they kind of have these sort of different levels of decentralization and relationships. And yours seems a little bit like the other way. Like, okay, well, let's start some decentralized type services and then move back and build a centralized exchange, which is cool.
00:13:44.946 - 00:13:52.482, Speaker C: I think that's really novel and curious as to how that'll go, but do you have thoughts on that or how that'll work or any more details?
00:13:52.626 - 00:14:43.526, Speaker B: Absolutely. So we're currently looking at where that's going to be based out of, and there is a few things that I can't drop now, but it's essentially going to be like a centralized exchange in essence, to where the order, depth and the volume and everything will be there. But it won't necessarily be like a centralized entity in the fact that it can be sued and regulated by governments around the world. I call it a centralized exchange, but it's most likely right now it's going to be decentralized. It's just going to provide the sort of volume that you get on those exchanges without the other side of it and the KYC and all of that. Definitely pretty far down the roadmap, though. So I'm going to be putting more thought into it for sure.
00:14:43.628 - 00:15:10.110, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really interesting when you think about decentralization as a principle. I mean, to me, decentralization is security. Decentralized for security. You don't just decentralize for fun. You can, but it's faster to go many centralized routes for computing and such. You do it for security. But when it comes to things like providing liquidity, that's the brilliance of an amm, is it lets anybody be a liquidity provider, even if it's this tiny, tiny sliver?
00:15:10.450 - 00:15:11.006, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:15:11.108 - 00:15:28.150, Speaker C: To massive market makers. And in the past that's totally gated. Like if you want to be a market maker on FTX or whatever, on Nasdaq, right. You got to come with some serious, serious money. It starts with a B money. And by opening that up and democratizing it, it's a really interesting change, for sure.
00:15:28.220 - 00:15:37.640, Speaker B: And we'd be aggregating all that across the market. And we're going to have dual treasuries. So we definitely have some of the tools required to build that.
00:15:39.930 - 00:15:55.600, Speaker A: It looks like our community is jumping in. We do have an interesting question coming from Tradfi what do you think about what is lacking in Defi and what opportunities can depot capitalize on? I do think this is interesting because we were talking about coming from the traditional space here. What do you think on that?
00:15:56.610 - 00:17:28.794, Speaker B: Just DeFi is so new, and because of what we have to build everything on top of within the smart contract, we see a lot of fragmentation. DeFi is sort of bringing that tradfi feel over, in essence, because we have all the tools, we're going to have all the data feeds, we have everything aggregated out of the top 99% of the market. Our platform is going to be like a Bloomberg terminal, but you can access and manage hundreds of trades across all different blockchains, decentralized protocols, NFT, marketplaces, sexes, all within three clicks, all on the same dashboard in the same page. And I think that's what Defi has been lacking. Obviously, it lacks a sense of centralization because it's decentralized, but it's almost too decent centralized to the point right now to where you have to have 50 different tabs open and all kinds of attack vectors on your computer. And it's hard to truly manage a portfolio in a professional sense. And I think what depot is doing is it's really building that foundation for the next generation of people to come into crypto and provide that feel that we get from traditional finance, but much faster, much more agile and able to access all these different protocols from one place.
00:17:28.992 - 00:18:00.614, Speaker C: Do you have a sense of your users yet? Is it people who've been on chains who are now coming to look for a solution? I'm on multiple different chains and L2s. Right? So is it people like me who are just sick of shuffling between metamask and figuring where it is? Where is that? No, that one's on BSc. No, I moved that to last on. Did they launch on avalanche yet? I don't know. Or is it people who are brand new, who are just like, don't even want to deal with all that nonsense and are like, okay, I just need one thing, or is it both, or do you have a sense yet?
00:18:00.732 - 00:18:52.520, Speaker B: I'd say it's both, but with the ratio of 70 30, we haven't really hit that paid marketing or that word of mouth level to where we're getting people that aren't in crypto completely to get into it. But people like you, Andy, that it's a major pain point that we're solving, and our community is full of those guys, and that's why they're so passionate about just we're doing some amazing things. And as far as, like you mentioned, metamask here, within two months, we're coming out with a wallet that's going to bridge and route everything in the back end from sexes to NFT marketplaces to Dexs and all the different blockchains. You're going to have that dashboard, but now it's going to be in like a chrome extension. You're going to be able to access everything from right there, all the different blockchains, and we're just making things more accessible and seamless for everyone.
00:18:58.410 - 00:19:08.618, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it seems like it's really interesting for your community. I mean, they're jumping and talking about how it's more user friendly. Mobile depot, is there something going on on mobile there as.
00:19:08.784 - 00:19:18.560, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we definitely. We plan to come out with the apps on the Apple and Android store here within two, three months.
00:19:20.370 - 00:19:36.962, Speaker A: So it's all making it a lot more accessible for everyone, which is really. Yeah, I mean, I remember when I first started getting into know, it's all mobile browser based and it's also very complicated terminology and everything. It's just not as easy for new people to jump in. So I feel like Depot can really specialize in this space.
00:19:37.096 - 00:19:42.454, Speaker B: Oh, for sure. That's a lot of opportunity there and then.
00:19:42.572 - 00:19:53.340, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is a good question, but is there any plans for depot to create a product where users can get collateral for NFTs they own? You might have talked about this a little bit, but it's good to bring it up.
00:19:53.870 - 00:20:37.846, Speaker B: So basically, where they could pull out a loan against that sort of not currently, but I mean, if it's a popular feature, we could definitely plan on aggregating that. And that's kind of like why our platform is able to just continue to grow and it's able to provide so much value because not only can we take these unique and revolutionary features from any product out there, but we aggregate them all in one place. So we are looking at NFT staking, obviously having NFTs across all blockchains and platforms in one place, but collateralized loans against those. I could definitely check that out. Please drop that in the discord and we'll do some research on it.
00:20:38.028 - 00:21:03.278, Speaker C: So using NFTs as collateral is challenging. It's a new sort of thing that I've seen a couple of projects try to do in the past couple of months or talk about. So jpegged is one just comes off the top of my head. They're using a chain link feed for getting average punk floor prices. I don't know if we're doing board apes, but there's a couple of major NFTs and it's really hard.
00:21:03.364 - 00:21:05.090, Speaker B: If you look at it fluctuates so much.
00:21:05.160 - 00:21:27.574, Speaker C: It fluctuates so much and the supply is tiny compared to tokens. If you think about where do you sell 10,000 jPegs? Right? 10,000 NFts. It's such a small volume of thing that if one sells per week, that sets the floor price compared to tokens, which are on centralized exchanges, hundreds of them, decentralized exchanges, thousands of them. Yeah.
00:21:27.612 - 00:21:28.706, Speaker B: They're not very liquid.
00:21:28.818 - 00:21:47.534, Speaker C: No, because of the lack of liquidity, finding that price is really hard, which we can find a price. Right. There's a price feed for it. There's a punk's price chain link punks price feed. But those aren't the only NFTs that people want to collateralize. You want to collateralize all your little things that are worth .5 ether, small amount.
00:21:47.534 - 00:22:07.306, Speaker C: That's a lot harder to do. So I suspect we're still going to be working towards that as the NFT space matures, as the NFT marketplaces mature. But you kind of got to start at this granular level. By the time you get up to a depot where it's aggregating the stuff, you kind of have that granular stuff in place. That's just my first instinct. I'm not saying it's impossible.
00:22:07.438 - 00:22:16.502, Speaker B: Well, yeah, and then the loan wouldn't be very competitive with just having it collateralized against Ethereum or BTC or. Yeah.
00:22:16.636 - 00:22:26.810, Speaker A: Finding those best opportunities. No, that makes total sense. And then I don't want to get too into it, but there are some questions on security. Do you want to cover at all how depot is focusing security within the platform?
00:22:26.960 - 00:23:10.280, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So every single big update, which is know, every three, four weeks we have a different audit and with different third party security vendors. So right now we're working with Biosyn for our initial bonds release. We've worked with safe solidity and Cyberunt in the past and we're just going to continue to work with these guys. And then our own internal QA processes are extremely robust. We're very careful with our security because we know that if one hack happens, it can completely change the outlook and future of that project. And we don't want to take anything away from what we've been building.
00:23:11.770 - 00:23:37.282, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is really serious. And I'm sure as you get more and more users, you just continue to think about it more and more. So that's totally. And then we do have stereo has just been asking about scalability throughout this chat, so I want to make sure to shout them out. But could you talk a little bit about scalability and how routing takes a lot of processing power? How is it going to be easy to increase demand and keep up with demand for sure?
00:23:37.336 - 00:24:54.294, Speaker B: So right now we're actually partnering with Infira and we are also refactoring our back end. So currently we've been averaging like 12 million different requests every single day. We're refactoring that, so we'll have about a third of that. And then with our partnership, the pricing works a little bit differently and now there's incentive on both ends to keep the platform up and running. But as far as the routing, I didn't even mention this earlier, so whenever you're going from Tradefi to Defi, obviously there's a lot more complex mechanisms within tradfi that allow for institutional level traders to just track the entire market and kind of dominate the entire market with all the different tools they have in DeFi, we don't really have an infrastructure built up there. So as far as a bridge and routing mechanism, like you mentioned, it's really cool to see what we're doing with that, because right now you want to go to a bridge, you type it in, and then all you can do is bridge. It's not very complex, but since we're aggregating everything in the one place, our bridging mechanism will connect CFI wallets with DeFi.
00:24:54.294 - 00:25:17.966, Speaker B: And then since we have every single platform encrypted into the dashboard, it'll be like an automatic routing process where you can pull from like four, five, six different accounts on the deck side of things and move it into sex at once, or it doesn't matter how many accounts you have, the entire back end will be connected. And I kind of went off on a whole nother tangent there. I'm really excited.
00:25:17.998 - 00:25:24.290, Speaker A: No, but it's good to highlight that for sure. And especially sharing things that make you unique is always exciting for everyone to listen in on.
00:25:24.360 - 00:25:35.990, Speaker C: I'm aggregating. I was thinking about the bridge. I'm bridging that meme. But that's all you're doing. You're just bridging. You're doing one thing, but aggregating.
00:25:38.490 - 00:25:58.030, Speaker A: We're having a mean. What I've loved of what you've talked about this whole time is just talking about how this is giving more accessibility to know. You were talking about how tradfi is so much more closed off and you do have to have an institutional background and things like that. And so everything is building feels just so much more open, for sure.
00:25:58.100 - 00:26:30.360, Speaker B: And that's definitely our philosophy. I want millions of people around the world to use our product and I wanted to provide for tons of people. I want all the revenue on our end to be used to build hospitals, feed children around the world, and just even donate against childhood cancer, climate change, stuff like that. And then the other 50% would just be going towards people keeping that buy pressure and eliminating almost all sell pressure on our tokens so we could just continue to grow and be in more people's hands.
00:26:31.050 - 00:26:40.780, Speaker A: I love it. And that's a perfect segue into just closing out. Is there anything else that you want to share about depot? What are you guys up to next? Anything coming up that we should be aware of?
00:26:41.150 - 00:27:16.870, Speaker B: Well, there is something exciting happening in our discord here after the call, so definitely tune in there. But as far as what's coming up, we have that wallet. And when I say wallet, I mean dashboard that's going to be accessible in a chrome extension. It's going to connect everything in crypto within three clicks. We have the dual layer bonding system coming out soon, we have mobile apps coming out soon. And then we are looking at a tier one sex listing here by the end of the month. So really excited about market.
00:27:16.870 - 00:27:20.310, Speaker B: There's literally so much. And then our NFC marketplace.
00:27:20.750 - 00:27:26.122, Speaker A: Amazing. And you were talking about the discord a bit. Where else can people find you, for sure?
00:27:26.176 - 00:27:31.206, Speaker B: So then there's our Twitter. It's depot. D E P o underscore IO.
00:27:31.318 - 00:27:33.258, Speaker C: Everything's down below. They can all find it.
00:27:33.264 - 00:27:34.182, Speaker B: We have down below.
00:27:34.256 - 00:27:34.880, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:27:36.210 - 00:28:00.054, Speaker C: It sounds like there is something exciting going on in the discord. So there are a few questions in the chat that we are unable to address here on the chainlink YouTube. But you can head to the depot discord, get some more details on those questions. Yeah, I think you guys know kind of what we're talking about. Yeah, it's the Snyder cut. Yeah, head to the other spot for that. But it sounds like there's a lot going on there.
00:28:00.054 - 00:28:07.446, Speaker C: So that discord, actually, I'll drop it again in the chat to make sure that you guys have it as Zajir wraps up here.
00:28:07.548 - 00:28:21.914, Speaker A: Yeah, no, thank you so much, TJ. It's been really awesome having you on the stream. I'm so impressed with this depot community. We don't always get so many comments and engagements, so this is super exciting. And we're really grateful to have you today. So thanks so much for coming.
00:28:21.952 - 00:28:24.714, Speaker B: Yeah, super grateful. Thank you. Bye.
00:28:24.842 - 00:28:42.460, Speaker A: All right, everybody, we are closing out. It has been awesome having you all on the stream today. Please do tune back in for our next live stream, which I'm sure we'll announce soon. And if you have any other questions, feel free to throw them in this chat and we'll be sure to send them over to TJ and the depot team. All right? And we'll chat soon.
