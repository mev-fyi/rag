00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: Ahead and get.
00:00:01.250 - 00:00:02.750, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, great.
00:00:02.900 - 00:00:21.920, Speaker A: Perfect. So, first off, I just want to thank the Force protocol, Chainlink and blockchain community for joining us today. Obviously, special thanks to David Lee, the CEO of the Force protocol, for taking time out of his day. I believe it's evening in China. So thank you so much for staying up with us and sort of joining us for A-Q-A. Really appreciate it.
00:00:22.370 - 00:00:23.550, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you.
00:00:23.700 - 00:01:00.510, Speaker A: Absolutely. I just want go over. The overall goal in this Q and A is really just to get the community more familiar with what the Force protocol and chain link is building, exploring what makes this integration unique and why it's ultimately beneficial to both teams. So this will be for about 30 to 40 minutes, kind of a question and answer structure, or I'll ask some questions, David will certainly answer them and kind of go into some detail about the force protocol. If for some reason you have a question that wasn't addressed again, feel free to stop by any of either the force protocol or Chainlink social channels. I'll have all of those in the description below if you'd like to join. And then basically we'll go ahead and get started.
00:01:00.510 - 00:01:04.660, Speaker A: So, good morning or good evening, David, where you're at? How are things for you?
00:01:05.830 - 00:01:09.380, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you very much. I'm here.
00:01:09.990 - 00:01:19.400, Speaker A: Excellent. So really to start us off, would love if you could maybe introduce yourself, give us a little bit of your background and kind of what you're currently working.
00:01:20.090 - 00:01:52.318, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Hello Roy and hello everyone. I'm David Lay, the CEO and the co founder of the Force protocol. I'm very happy to be here with all of you in this AMA today. So first let me introduce about myself. I was engaged in bitcoin mining for about one year between the year 2011 and the year 2012.
00:01:52.318 - 00:03:01.414, Speaker B: So that is when I was in graduated school. And after my graduation I worked for several leading companies in healthcare, Internet finance and software development. And then I began the research on blockchain and crypto since the year 2017 and after two year research and study, I founded the fourth protocol with my friends in my business school and they are Alan, Lewis, Michael and we all built this project together and to aiming at the crypto finance. So the name of our project is origin is from the movie Star wars. So in the movie the force is a very important concept. It is the most important power to secure the love and peace in the universe in that movie. So joining from this important concept, we named our product.
00:03:01.414 - 00:03:57.990, Speaker B: So the force, this is what our name come from. And our project is building the DeFi service infrastructure based on blockchain systems. And the protocols products include DeFi technical components and multiple tokenization protocols based on DeFi technical components. That is from our project. So our chain integrates the bound financing protocol, the crypto loan protocol, and the decentralized stablecoin protocol to form the fortube deFi service platform. I think that's the introduction of myself and my project. Thank you, Roy.
00:03:58.330 - 00:04:15.200, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Thank you so much for sharing. I'd love to get a little bit more into Fortube and really the three products. So if you could maybe explain a little bit, maybe what Fortube is in a little bit more detail and then maybe getting into what those three products are in.
00:04:16.130 - 00:04:59.606, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, yeah, no problem. So Fortube is the short version of, you know, the YouTube, right? So people are a video site. However, we are not. We wish our users can make a great fortune through our defi service on the fortube platform. So the fortube will provide individual and enterprise users with crypto asset investment, financing and trading services to meet different crypto financial needs of these users. So Fortube has three functional components.
00:04:59.606 - 00:05:59.866, Speaker B: They are the fortube bound fortube bank and chain stable coin. First, the Fortune bond is a bound bonding protocol of the crypto asset loan service with fixed term and interest rate. So the term and the interest rate is fixed, it's about maybe 50 days and 30 days, 60 days, something like that. And users can issue their crypto bound on the fortune platform. So the whole process is totally decentralized. Each term of crypto bond is issued in a form of ERC 20 and we call them bound tokens. So each term of the bound tokens has its own ERC 20 contract which contains all the necessary information and related operations of the bond.
00:05:59.866 - 00:06:38.534, Speaker B: So the bond tokens are indivisible and their face value is usually 100 us dollar. So the bound tokens can be transferred freely. So I can send my bound tokens to you directly. And the person who holds the bound tokens is a creditor in a debt relationship and can use the bound token to redeem the principal and the interest on the fortune platform. Yes. So that is the fortune bound. And the fortune bound is now fully operational on the Ethereum mainnet.
00:06:38.534 - 00:07:46.494, Speaker B: So everyone can try our bound service. So the fortune bank is the second component is a lower service protocol, provides token deposited under the lower services with algorithm driven current and variable interest rate. So I think people are very familiar with compound, right? So we will provide a similar service like compound. The difference of us between compound is we will focus on asian market first and support the crypto assets such as HT, the OKB and the HBTC, IBTC and other crypto assets. They are issued by the Asia crypto projects. And we also introduce different interest rate. The interest rate algorithm of ourselves is different of compound.
00:07:46.494 - 00:08:33.698, Speaker B: So we use three segmentations functional model to calculate the interest rate at different lending ratio. So this can make our adjustment of the interest rate more precise. And the most important point is the code of our products. Yes, the code, every single line of our code is developed by ourselves, not fork or copy from project. So with respect, current DeFi players, they are doing a great job, so we will never copy them. We will create our own project to engage in the competition. Yes.
00:08:33.698 - 00:09:40.600, Speaker B: So the third component, the Chan stablecoin, it is a decentralized stable coin and is designed for everyone to mint and use. So the crypto assets holders, they can lock their assets to the chain smart contract to obtain the amount of chance stablecoin that is equivalent of the fiat currency without having to pay any interest. So there is no interest in the Chen stablecoin system. It is a very big difference between Megadao and Chen. So the stablecoin Chen is regarded as the currency exchange proof issued by the smart contract to the holders of crypto assets. So you can imagine Chen is the next generation of the decentralized stablecoin, not like McDowell currently. Yes.
00:09:40.600 - 00:10:45.430, Speaker B: So Chen introduced the innovative price stabilization mechanisms. We have different price stabilization mechanism such as we have zero holding cost, the volatility index and the smooth arbitrage liquidation of the crypto assets. So there are a series of the mechanism in the stable coin. Yes. So this stable coin can be used for investment in the fortiff bond, for deposit in the fortiff bank for interest. So it may be used as a payment tool in transactions of our partners in different DeFi projects or crypto wallets. So Qian will pack the RMB because we're based in China.
00:10:45.430 - 00:11:15.722, Speaker B: So we focus on RMB. So that is also a difference between Dai. Yes, because Dai is packed on USD. So our market strategy is focusing on the asian market. Currently, a lot of the crypt holders have the need of chinese yuan in the stablecoin. So these people will be our first users. So I think, yeah, that's the introduction of the fortube and the three components.
00:11:15.722 - 00:11:17.110, Speaker B: Thank you. Awesome.
00:11:17.180 - 00:11:51.680, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you so much for that detailed description. So it really sounds like you're really taking kind of some of the best parts of Defi and kind of really combining them essentially into almost one protocol or one marketplace that kind of works seamlessly together for users. Yeah, very cool. So love to get. So I know you said the bond is live. Interested to know what's kind of the next thing on your product roadmap. What do you expect to go live next?
00:11:52.630 - 00:12:36.540, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. The next step of us, right. Our future development milestones will be in July. In next month we will finish the integration of the lower stablecoin and bond into the fortube platform. And then we wish to create a one stop DeFi platform users. So also in the July 2020, we will initiate the launch of Stablecoin, the Chan 2.0 version, the second version of Chen, what I introduced just now.
00:12:36.540 - 00:13:22.240, Speaker B: And in September we will officially launch the Defi application security protocol component that can used by other DeFi projects, which include our understanding of the security protection in the DeFi industry. So this year we will also trying to collaborate with finance Chan Polkadot Cosmos so this grid project in the Portugal business, so that is to introduce our service to more users worldwide and in different grid projects. So that is our roadmap in this year.
00:13:22.610 - 00:13:38.180, Speaker A: Awesome. So supporting kind of a multi chain DeFi protocol. Okay, very cool, very interesting. I think that's a unique approach in this space and it sounds like you've got a lot of work ahead, but it also sounds like you're working pretty quickly at the same time.
00:13:38.630 - 00:13:39.380, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:13:40.230 - 00:13:51.830, Speaker A: So getting into kind of chainlink and the integration here, could you maybe briefly explain what you're using kind of the Chainlink Oracle network for in the force protocol?
00:13:52.970 - 00:14:00.454, Speaker B: Okay, so first, why we need to use Oracle service in the DeFi product?
00:14:00.572 - 00:14:00.866, Speaker A: Sure.
00:14:00.908 - 00:15:48.970, Speaker B: Because we all know the oracle problem of the DeFi, right? So a smart contract is only as good as its data source, but however, the data in a completely open decentralized network isn't necessarily reliable, so you can't trust just a decentralized price source. So people, if we want to use the decentralized smart contract every day, but if the Oracle are usually centralized, so it's not only safety but also the necessity of the smart contract existence will be challenged because the oracle is centralized, but your smart contract is decentralized. So why I just directly use the centralized service? That's enough, right? So the Oracle opportunity is where the project like, right. You are stepped to this problem to try to solve it and by use a valuable token to let participants get rewarded for providing good data to your oracle system. So how to protect the security? Make sure everything is correctly operating in a blockchain system. So you need to put some crypto or token behind it to play the governance role. So there's some kind of governance token to make sure all the players are behaving so that data quality can be assured.
00:15:48.970 - 00:16:13.460, Speaker B: And this is exactly what Channing has done. So the Chenk team has done it in an open and extensible fashion. So in that you have a technology solution to make the price source decentralized and reliable, that's also the reason why we are seeking for the integration. Yes.
00:16:14.070 - 00:16:49.870, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, no, I think that makes perfect sense. I think you did a good job of explaining. You build all these decentralized kind of mechanisms, services, and then if you turn around and use a centralized oracle, essentially that becomes the weakest link or that becomes maybe your biggest point of failure. So yeah, I think that makes perfect sense. And then for the price feeds, what are you planning on using? Are you planning on using it for the interest rate or for the stablecoin? What's kind of the use of the price feed here for force protocol?
00:16:50.370 - 00:17:26.874, Speaker B: Okay, just like I said, we have the fortune platform and the have different components. So we firstly want to use the chain link price feed into the bank protocol. So the bank is, I just said it relies on the price feed of the different crypto assets like ethereum and bitcoin. And so we will first to integrate channing, the price feed service into the bank service. Guys, awesome.
00:17:26.992 - 00:17:41.680, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah, thank you so much. Would you explain maybe how was it like working with the team behind Chainlink? What was the integration process like?
00:17:45.030 - 00:18:47.010, Speaker B: So firstly, just like I said, our smart contract needs reliable price source. So to challenge team, you also need to expand the market sharing in the decentralized oracle service. So that's the beginning of the two teams. Yes, we both agree to have the price feed into our platform. So by doing so, we know that the chaink is decentralized Oracle network that currently provides decentralization at both the Oracle and the data source level. So the first step of our two teams is to use the data directly from. No, not the data, the price data from your oracle.
00:18:47.010 - 00:19:12.860, Speaker B: Yes. And we get a lot of help from the technical team to make us quickly integrate your service into our platform. So before we launch the bank service officially and we finish that work. So it's really a channing speed. Yes, very quick.
00:19:13.650 - 00:19:34.994, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Yeah, I know. That's a big thing is trying to work quickly so that you can focus on building all the other things that are very important inside your protocol. Perfect. David would love to get a little bit kind of explore a little bit about yourself. Do you do anything? Obviously you're very busy and I'm sure you're working on this night and day.
00:19:34.994 - 00:19:47.320, Speaker A: Do you have any interest outside of blockchain that you pursue when you're not working? Any hobbies or anything of that nature? Or are you just working on the first force protocol all day, every day?
00:19:47.950 - 00:20:39.098, Speaker B: Okay. As a co founder of this project, maybe for every day I will work over hours, maybe. But actually, yes, I have some spare time of myself. So when I was not working, I usually go to watch some Sci-Fi movies just like the Matrix. I love the movie very much and I will read some Sci-Fi novel also. So there is a very famous book in China named the three body problems. Maybe you have already heard of it because Barack Obama has already also recommended of this book.
00:20:39.098 - 00:20:59.120, Speaker B: So I also recommend everyone to read it. Yes, the movie and the book will take my spare time. And also I have a little girl, my baby, so I will go home and to spend the time with her. Yes.
00:20:59.490 - 00:21:02.030, Speaker A: Awesome. How old is your daughter?
00:21:02.550 - 00:21:05.540, Speaker B: Yeah, less than one year.
00:21:05.910 - 00:21:06.674, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Okay.
00:21:06.712 - 00:21:06.866, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:06.888 - 00:21:40.026, Speaker A: So that's a lot of work. So work all day. So you're a very busy man, David. I have two daughters that remember what it was like when they were under one year old and it was a lot of time and effort and a lot of love. So I definitely understand you're a very busy man right now. Yeah, perfect. Well, I guess kind of the next thing is, is there anything kind of upcoming that you want to make kind of users aware about? Obviously they can start interacting with the platform.
00:21:40.026 - 00:21:53.570, Speaker A: Now you have some components, I know that are live, but just interested to know is there anything people should look out for and then what's kind of the best way to follow you or to follow the development of the force protocol?
00:21:54.390 - 00:22:50.270, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we are building our community on the telegram and on the Twitter. So every step of our project we will share to our community in the community channels. So if people are interested in our project and our services, first I recommend them to use fortube for the first step to become our user to try the cool defi service. Yes. And after that, if people think we are really good and they really recognition to us. So I recommend people to join our community on Telegram and to follow our Twitter account. We will share every interesting step of our project to our friends.
00:22:50.270 - 00:22:51.120, Speaker B: Yes.
00:22:51.490 - 00:23:07.560, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Well, thank you so much for that. We'll put those links in the description option as well. So anyone viewing the video can certainly watch that and then kind of the last thing. Is there anything else that you wanted to share before we kind of wrap up the Q a here today?
00:23:08.970 - 00:23:14.746, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'd like to share about the security of our product.
00:23:14.928 - 00:23:15.706, Speaker A: Sure.
00:23:15.888 - 00:24:25.378, Speaker B: Yes. Because before we launch our product officially, we will first to make our code be audited by the tier one audit audit team. For example, before we launch our bounce talk protocol, we had the slow mist audit team to audit our code together with us, we make sure every code is safe and then we launch our product, but the audit is not enough. So when we are running our service and we have a bug bounty program currently operating. So if you find a bug on our platform. Yes. Just send the information to us and we will give you rewards of it.
00:24:25.378 - 00:24:30.018, Speaker B: Yes. To join our bug buggy program. Yes.
00:24:30.184 - 00:24:57.980, Speaker A: Well, I definitely respect and appreciate that you kind of audited your code prior to going live. I'm sure you're aware that sometimes people create a DeFi product without auditing their code and just going live and then kind of hoping everything sort of works out. So I definitely think that was the right approach. Could you explain a little bit, maybe kind of how long that process is? How long does that auditing process usually take for a team like yourself? From the beginning of the audit to the end?
00:25:00.290 - 00:25:21.460, Speaker B: Take the bound audit process as an example. We take about three weeks of the whole audit process, but if we add the discussion of our process, so it takes over one month of the total audit process.
00:25:22.470 - 00:26:00.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I know that's a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of investments. But I think if you want to make something that's going to be here for years, which is the goal, you've got to have a strong foundation. So certainly understand that. But yeah, I'm aware the auditing process is very long, but at the same time very necessary. Yeah, that's perfect. Well, I want to say thank you again, David, for joining us. I think you're creating something that's pretty unique and interesting in this space where you're really combining maybe some of the best aspects of some of the kind of DeFi protocols that are there and putting them in one place, in one location.
00:26:00.762 - 00:26:20.326, Speaker A: So I think that's very interesting. As I mentioned before, we'll share all of kind of your website, all your social channels in the description as well. I know that you're very busy. I know it's the evening there in China. So I want to say thank you again for joining us. Thank you again for all the community for joining us. In a few hours, we'll just have kind of the new uploaded version onto YouTube as well.
00:26:20.326 - 00:26:37.160, Speaker A: I'll share that with your team as well, David. And then anyone who wasn't able to join us here because they were busy can always watch this video and really looking forward to following your progress, seeing how you continue to build things out and excited to see what the future brings for you.
00:26:37.610 - 00:26:39.334, Speaker B: Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
00:26:39.452 - 00:26:51.006, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody, for joining us. Hopefully, David, we'll be able to do this again maybe in six months when you have some kind of more updates and developments and we can let everybody know all the cool things that you've built since our last.
00:26:51.188 - 00:26:52.942, Speaker B: Okay? Okay. No problem. Yeah.
00:26:52.996 - 00:26:57.598, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Thank you so much, David. You have a great day.
00:26:57.764 - 00:26:58.782, Speaker B: Thank you, everybody.
00:26:58.916 - 00:26:59.386, Speaker A: Bye bye.
00:26:59.418 - 00:27:00.890, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you, everybody. Bye.
