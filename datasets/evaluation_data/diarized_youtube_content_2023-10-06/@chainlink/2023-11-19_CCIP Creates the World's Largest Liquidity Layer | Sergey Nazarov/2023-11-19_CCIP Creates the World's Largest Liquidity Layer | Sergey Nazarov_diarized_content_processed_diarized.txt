00:00:00.170 - 00:00:46.634, Speaker A: The real plan for CCIP. Not to say that it's a secret, I think you've probably heard this plan before. But more accurately, the whole plan for CCIP is to have it adopted as the messaging and value transfer standard in public chains, and the messaging and value transfer standard in the capital markets. So basically, all the banks and asset managers that have all the money, you get all of the application nations that are able to move quickly and innovate and build exciting new versions of the world, and then you connect them with all the money that can use them. And I think you get a world where there's a lot of applications with a lot of usage over CCIP. Basically, that's the world that we're working towards. And it can all actually work on the same messaging system.
00:00:46.634 - 00:01:20.660, Speaker A: It's actually better if it does, because as the public blockchain folks adopt CCIP and the capital markets folks adopt CCIP, they'll both start to realize more and more that their way to transact and their way to interact with each other is through CCIP. That's kind of the final part of the plan. And then that will also have this immensely powerful effect of creating the world's largest liquidity layer. So the place where the most banks, the most apps, the most wallets, the most asset managers are connected with their users value.
