00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.200, Speaker A: We go ready?
00:00:04.450 - 00:00:32.870, Speaker B: Welcome everyone. Really excited. Preston and Christian joining us today of the Cryptex team. Cryptx is a fascinating protocol getting built. They have a TCAP token that's tied to the toll crypto market cap. Explain a little bit about their project and what makes this relationship unique with Chainlink and how they're using decentralized oracles. To start off, Christian, you want to maybe just introduce yourself and a little bit about your background?
00:00:35.930 - 00:01:03.120, Speaker C: Yeah. I am from Honduras and currently living here in Tuisi Alpa Hondras. I started my first company on 2013. I studied computer science. It was mobile payment systems for sms. So in the US you got square, you got PayPal, you got braintrine, a lot of libraries, but here in Honduras you don't have anything. So that was the reason to start this company.
00:01:03.120 - 00:01:38.518, Speaker C: And it really sucked. I mean the company died horrible and we had a lot of trouble from finance institutions, banks, communications. And I say that I will never work on fintech again. Lately I had some research on bitcoin at the start of that year, but I actually got interesting at the end of the last bubble on 2017. 2018. And from that I started reading about Ethereum and got really excited about it and started coding some DFI stuff. Went to a lot of hackathons.
00:01:38.518 - 00:02:01.954, Speaker C: That's where I met another fellow underrant. That is Raul Hordan from the prismatic team. And he introduced me to Preston and from that I started working. Well, Preston called me and asked me if you were interested in building some smart contract for a different product and that's how I got over here.
00:02:02.152 - 00:02:19.418, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. I know the pains of startups, especially when you're first beginning Preston, I know that you're working on some really cool things as well and we're kind of working on s 2.0. Do you want to give a little bit about your background and what your role is?
00:02:19.584 - 00:03:03.282, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm a career software engineer. I've been working on software ever since high school. It started with video games and hacking and scripting things and it progressed into just everyday trying to find the hardest problem to solve. So right now I work at Prismatic Labs building e two and also working with Cryptex to try to build the new and novel products for the d five space. Yeah. I met christian at a hackathon.
00:03:03.282 - 00:03:24.202, Speaker A: He offered me a bag of coffee for one of his startups. Thank you again. It's great coffee. And ever since then I've always wanted to work with Christian and I was really happy to be able to work with him on TCAP it's been great.
00:03:24.336 - 00:03:40.370, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds a cool story to meet your other partners in this. So let's kind of break down cryptex and what your goal and vision of building this is and where you are currently within the product roadmap.
00:03:43.110 - 00:04:39.080, Speaker A: Sure, I can start with that. So cryptex is aiming to build some really exciting products for defi space. So our first, I guess, flagship product is called tcap, which is the total market cap token. And the point of this token is that it has a price that is tightly coupled or pegged to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. So what we see out there today is we see token baskets and these kind of like collections of cryptocurrencies, but we don't see anything that's, I mean, those might be capturing the top ten or maybe even top 100 if you're bold enough, but nothing is capturing everything or cassie as wide of a net as what TCaP is aiming to do.
00:04:41.290 - 00:05:03.710, Speaker B: Got it. Okay, yeah, that sounds fascinating. And so with this, what really makes it unique compared to some of the other, there's rebase models and I was reading your white paper, and there's a few different models of kind of capturing this whole market value. What makes TCAp unique compared to some of these other versions?
00:05:08.170 - 00:05:59.330, Speaker C: We're using collateral in order to actually create this value of the TcAP token. This actually allows us to create not only tcaP, but multiple strategies. We, for example, are focusing right now on the security of the users. And you ask about our roadmap. Right? So we have been developing cryptic from a year and we were ready to launch like October, November last year, but we decided that we needed create a more secure. We want to prevent blacksmung. We know that blacksmith are really hard to spot, but we wanted to create something really secure.
00:05:59.330 - 00:06:21.402, Speaker C: So we are right now on the reconv testnet trying to squash those bugs. But we feel like really confident that once we launch, it's going to be that time that the user are more secure to stake collateral and use it to mint TCAP.
00:06:21.546 - 00:06:49.400, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And security is sexy. You got to definitely be careful with everything, especially in this crazy market. So definitely appreciate that and having the user interest first. So that's actually really cool with this. Where do you see the grander vision? I see. Okay, maybe the total market cap is going to keep going up, but what is the approach to Defi for cryptex as a whole?
00:06:51.690 - 00:07:07.414, Speaker A: So one of our founders, Joe Staco, is a big finance guy. He works in trading all the time. So he's got a lot of ideas on what some of these investor type people like him want. So I'm a developer.
00:07:07.462 - 00:07:08.470, Speaker C: I'm not an investor.
00:07:08.550 - 00:08:14.420, Speaker A: I suck at trading. I can't think of these things, but I know how they work and how to build them. And so Joe has some ideas, like looking people want to trade on the bitcoin dominance. So how much percentage of the total market cap is bitcoin versus everything else? You could imagine a token that trades on that, perhaps something that trades based on the number of transactions per day or even the gas fees. Joe has a lot of ideas like that. And what we're really trying to do is just to bring some, I guess, financial instruments or different types of trading that just aren't really out there yet and that are interesting for some people who are kind of borderline on gambling, but also smart enough to read these charts. We really want to help bring some really unique products to the Defi space.
00:08:15.430 - 00:08:47.440, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely see it also almost being a stairway to get more people involved in the space that they're seeing in the index. That's a lot more clear than having to sit there and pick out which one of their favorite might be. So, yeah, I love the concept and definitely see everything continuing in this direction with it. How does Chainlink and decentralized oracles fit into TCAP and the cryptx of what you were building?
00:08:50.930 - 00:10:03.390, Speaker C: So Chainlink, actually, at the start, we started creating all oracle network ourselves. And when we got in contact with Chainlink, actually, it makes a lot of sense to us in the sense that it actually allows us to save some time on the development because you guys already have all the network and developing costs and a lot of stuff related to that. And something that it was really impressive to us is that if we had finished our Oracle network and launched it with it, we will have only like one provider. I mean, a lot of effort to just have one provider really centralized initial project, some proof of concept. And with Chainlink, we actually have five providers and different nodes, like eight nodes I think we have right now. And that allow us a much greater decentralization and saving a lot of cost on creating that network. It was really easy to launch.
00:10:03.390 - 00:10:19.500, Speaker C: I mean, the Oracles were the first thing that got us really worried at the start of the project. Right now, it's like, okay, we know chainly can handle that, so we can focus on adding security on other layers, like on the collaritization and stuff like that.
00:10:20.510 - 00:10:39.360, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, I'm curious, what were the worries of the Oracles, when you're first starting out and what were you kind of considering from a developer mindset? What was that thought process going into? Okay, I have to find the data sources or where was the questions coming from?
00:10:41.990 - 00:11:38.654, Speaker A: Yeah, so we saw the oracle as a critical piece of infrastructure for our software, but also saw it as this huge undertaking and also then maintenance burden. So we know that where we want to source the data from. But of course, each of these top rated exchanges have a different API format, so we'll have to basically writing these data ingestion pipelines for each individual exchange. So it doesn't scale very well. So it'd be a lot of work. And then also in terms of putting the data on chain, that costs gas, it costs a lot of money. And with Chainlink, we're saving a ton of money on that and I guess a shared oracle.
00:11:38.654 - 00:12:07.306, Speaker A: So other people can benefit from this work through chainlink, not just us, because it is public data, it's open source data that everyone can access. So we're really happy to leverage this existing framework and use chainlink to get the data that, to get real world data for our application. That's literally referencing all of the data of the world. It's a total market cap.
00:12:07.488 - 00:12:59.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's really fascinating, something that not everyone sees too. The more people that are using this network, the more it becomes better for every single other person involved and more people can begin using it and it lowers the cost for everyone. It's really interesting to hear the thought process that goes into the design mechanics of what you're trying to build all the way from whatever kind of application. So definitely appreciate that response. And so with this, you're on Rinkbeat testnet now, and I see that you have vaults. Do you want to talk, Preston, maybe a little bit about how the collateral works with TCAP and some of the different strategies that are going to be involved with cryptx for the collateral backing.
00:13:00.610 - 00:13:44.940, Speaker A: Okay, so one thing that we thought about when we were designing TCAP is we can say that this token is worth $105, but what is actually going to give us some value. So you can't just take our word for it. And we're not just printing money here. So what we came up with is very similar to the Makerdao dai model. You're having. Some users who want to create TCAP into existence at a certain pegged price based on the oracle can do so by providing some type of collateral. Right.
00:13:44.940 - 00:15:00.290, Speaker A: What they would do is they open a vault, they put in some backing collateral, and then from there they can issue TCAP tokens against their collateral. So in the testnet currently we're supporting ETH as collateral and then wrapped ETh by proxy for that Dai wrapped bitcoin. I think that's it for now. But the protocol or the way the contract is designed is that future assets can be used as backing collateral at a later date. So we could see very interesting things with other types of defi tokens being used as collateral. Yeah, we just wanted to make sure that TCAP had something backing it and it's not the rebaser model, which we found to be not very feasible. So the price of TCAP moves so much that rebasing once a day or even once an hour is not enough to provide that arbitrage that's needed to keep the price stable.
00:15:00.290 - 00:15:04.100, Speaker A: So we went with the collateral backing model.
00:15:04.630 - 00:15:36.400, Speaker B: Yeah, fascinating. And there's nothing else like that out there. So really exciting from what you see, that's what you're starting with with maker. You see them exploring different real estate backing and all the way to synthetic assets. What are some of the stuff that you see out in the market right now that you're really excited about as potentially being brought on chain that are off chain assets at the moment? Christian too, if you have anything that you're really excited about that you see.
00:15:40.370 - 00:15:57.462, Speaker C: So actually the first thing is that people are saying, when are we going to launch? That means that there's a lot of interest on that. I personally, when I first hear the idea of TCAP, it was like, hey, this is a good idea.
00:15:57.516 - 00:15:57.638, Speaker B: Why?
00:15:57.644 - 00:16:45.478, Speaker C: It doesn't exist, right? And I'm not a trader, I am a developer like Preston. And there's a lot of people with a lot of ideas or discord that are like saying, hey, I want this, hey, I want that. So we build cryptics and TCAP in order to create something that is reusable. So like pres mentioned, we can add any ERC 20 token as collateral. Of course, it has to be like the community has to be the one that chooses which collateral they want. It's the same for the vault and for the TCAP token that represents. I mean, we can create easily new PTC dominance and new products that we as developers don't really know what create.
00:16:45.478 - 00:17:18.394, Speaker C: I mean, it's like the community of traders, of Defi power users that know what they want and we can easily build mean. What is really exciting is seeing how much people is helping and talking on the community side. Sometimes I don't even have time to respond all the answer. But there's another community member that is helping and they are really engaged. So it's really exciting to see how these products connect people and that's what we want. We want to be a decentralized protocol.
00:17:18.522 - 00:17:35.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. That's great. It's exciting to see your community grow and your baby grow like that. So that's really cool if people want to join the community and where are people talking? Do you have a discord telegram? Where's the best place?
00:17:37.290 - 00:18:11.970, Speaker A: So we have a discord right now. I think we can drop you a link for that for YouTube. We don't have a telegram right now. I think we have an announcements channel. But we found the telegram chat was kind of difficult to manage where Discord is something better for us as moderators to be able to use and it has supports like channels and stuff like that. Discord is the best way to connect with us. We are also on Twitter as cryptex Global and our website cryptex finance.
00:18:12.950 - 00:18:30.840, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. I'll make sure to drop all those links for everyone in the description afterwards. Yeah. And then I guess also to follow up with you, Preston, with your work at epismetic labs. And congratulations on the start of the launch of f 2.0. And how is all that working as well at the moment?
00:18:31.370 - 00:19:11.742, Speaker A: Thank you. That was a really huge hurdle for us. It was almost three years in the making for us. The idea has been going much longer, but for prismatically, we worked on it almost three years and it's gone extremely well. So it kind of far exceeded our expectations in terms of community confidence. If you look at the deposit contract, it has something like $2.7 billion of locked up Ethereum, which is huge, something like 2% of the whole circulating supply, which is great.
00:19:11.742 - 00:19:42.190, Speaker A: We knew that the community was confident in us, but that's a huge amount of confidence. But 2.7 billion on this really radical redesign of Ethereum being Ethereum 2.0. So it's so far great success with switching or starting bootstrapping proof of stake, which is hard to do. And then in the future we're migrating to full proof of stake and adding shards and all that other stuff.
00:19:42.340 - 00:20:00.594, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, it was really exciting to see the total value, lock it in. And then I don't think there was ever a question that is going to happen, but yeah, congratulations. And it's really exciting for the entire space. And I know you guys have put a whole lot of work into it, so it's really exciting. Yeah.
00:20:00.632 - 00:20:01.460, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:20:02.330 - 00:20:13.080, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. And anything else with cryptex or anything else that you want to let the community know about before we wrap up.
00:20:16.010 - 00:21:06.150, Speaker A: So we would like to see people try out the application on rinkby. It doesn't cost anything. We're looking for any kind of user feedback. So if it's confusing, uncomfortable, or doesn't work the way you expected it to work, we really want to hear that feedback. Best way would be to join our discord to get in touch with everybody, try out the app, cryptex finance, read the documentation. We need things like people to build arbitrage bots and to have these automated market makers. That's something that we're going to work on, but we would love for it to be hands off on and be a truly decentralized protocol because it's going to be public on the blockchain.
00:21:06.150 - 00:21:32.560, Speaker A: And writing these type of software can be profitable. And we're not really interested in making money off arbitrage. We're interested in providing new and novel products to investors. So reach out on discord. You can talk to me and Christian directly about different ideas on what you can build on top of TCAP or using TCAP, even if just on the test network. We'd love to chat about that.
00:21:33.090 - 00:21:49.960, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds really exciting. And again, I'll make sure to drop all those links for everyone. But I think this is really what makes TCAP and what you're working on. So fascinating posability of how this can fit into so many different defi protocols and really bright future and really excited to see it grow.
00:21:51.530 - 00:21:51.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:52.060 - 00:22:05.410, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, sweet guys. Well, I appreciate you coming on and thanks everyone who's listening in. If you have questions, definitely join the cryptex discord and feel free to ask questions to Preston and Christian.
