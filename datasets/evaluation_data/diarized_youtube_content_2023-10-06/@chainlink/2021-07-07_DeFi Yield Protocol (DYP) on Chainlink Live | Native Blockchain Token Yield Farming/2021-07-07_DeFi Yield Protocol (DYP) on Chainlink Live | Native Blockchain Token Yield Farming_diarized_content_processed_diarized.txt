00:00:00.330 - 00:00:04.782, Speaker A: Mihai, what do you see as some exciting stuff that's going on in Defi right now?
00:00:04.916 - 00:00:14.506, Speaker B: Right now I see a lot of development on multiple chains. You know, I mean, first it started with Ethereum, but right now we see Defi everywhere.
00:00:14.618 - 00:00:29.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. Almost everybody I talked to in these sessions, these series are building on multiple chains. And they're different chains too. It's not everybody on Ethereum and poly. It's some people aren't BSc. Some people are going avalanche. Some people are getting ready for Cardano.
00:00:29.810 - 00:00:45.322, Speaker A: And I feel know a couple of years ago people were talking multi chain. Now people are still talking multi chain. But I can go on metamask and I can flip around and transact on different chains. And it's not hard. It works. Defi works multi chain. Let's do it.
00:00:45.456 - 00:00:46.140, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:52.350 - 00:01:12.478, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs and I'm here with Mihai from DYP. That's Defi yield protocol. We're going to be talking about DYP, what they do about yield aggregators, and of course, how Chainlink plays a role. Mihai, it's great to have you here. Lead us off. What is DYP, what are you guys all about and what sets you apart?
00:01:12.654 - 00:01:35.014, Speaker B: Okay, so hi again, Andy. Thank you very much for having us tonight here. And let me tell you a few things about. We are, I'm happy to say that we managed to build a complete ecosystem. I mean, we offer a lot of solutions for any user, for any project. And the most important thing is that we offer unique solutions. And I'm going to give you some examples.
00:01:35.014 - 00:02:12.710, Speaker B: Let's say you are a user and you are looking for a way to earn a passive income, because this is what Defi means. Let's say you choose the yield farming. Everyone knows the yield farming. You can go for Ethereum or for binance, smart chain. And pretty soon we are going to also have yield farming on avalanche. But let's talk first about Ethereum, because it was our first product and why it is unique and it is better than most of the yield farming aggregators. So first of all, any user that is providing Liquidity is getting the rewards in Ethereum.
00:02:12.710 - 00:03:28.746, Speaker B: So I think this is a big change because let's say you join a new project, you are getting good rewards. But when you want to sell the rewards because you want the USDT, for example, or the Ethereum, you cannot sell it because there is no liquidity. Also, there is the risk that someone, an investor comes with a very big amount of money. They get a lot of rewards and the price of the token can go down 50%, for example in just 24 hours. And this is bad for the rest of the investors with UIP, all of the users, like I already told you, are getting the Ethereum rewards on the Ethereum network. And we use a future that we are calling it antimanipulation future. So if the slippage is too big when the smart contracts are changing the rewards into Ethereum, that part of the amount from the rewards is going through the governance, and the governance can decide after seven days, after ten days, after one month, I don't know, they can make a proposal and they can burn the undistributed rewards or if they burn to distribute them again they are going distributed automatically with the slippage.
00:03:28.746 - 00:03:50.550, Speaker B: So there is no risk of the price going down. And this is very important. I mean since we launched the yield farming pool we paid almost just one moment. I can give you the exact number from our website, more than 8500 ethereums to the liquidity providers. This is a big amount for a new project, even for a big project.
00:03:50.620 - 00:04:29.010, Speaker A: I think so yield farming on its own. Let's look at yield farming for a second. So for a lot of yield farming I got to provide liquidity two different tokens for the most part on an exchange somewhere. And then I take a token and I deposit it into another protocol and I earn rewards on that. That gives me kind of exposure to these yield farming tokens in a couple of different places. So a yield aggregator, which is what you guys do or one of the products that you guys do is pretty different. How does it take away some of my risk or what kind of value does a yield aggregator really give to me?
00:04:29.080 - 00:05:04.522, Speaker B: Okay, so the main risk that we are taking care of it is the part of the rewards that nobody can take. All of the rewards sell the rewards and crush the token price very fast. I think this is one of the most important ones. Another one, for example, you are getting directly Ethereum so you no longer need to do another transaction to swap your rewards or something like this. So you end up paying less money. Also the process can be hard for most of the users because this is the beginning of this. These are two of the risk.
00:05:04.522 - 00:05:33.670, Speaker B: Also we have different lockup times. For example, you can go for three days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. All of these are meant to protect the funds of the users in order to help the contracts for some bad scenarios. This is how we help the investors. The main things that we are doing for them.
00:05:33.820 - 00:06:09.262, Speaker A: So a lot of times like a whale investor will provide liquidity, earn rewards and then in that native token and then just dump it right away because that's what curve suffered from a while, right? Is like they would get rewarded in the curve token and it was just dump dump dump, dump curve created this other staking mechanism to kind of offset some of that. And then different yield aggregator protocols have taken advantage of that in different ways in an interesting way. So it sounds like you guys are providing a solution for other protocols that don't have that sort of native staking necessarily. And lockup.
00:06:09.406 - 00:06:34.650, Speaker B: Yes, we can provide this. And also with us, it doesn't matter if you are a small investor or a big investor, it's the same thing. You cannot manipulate or have any advantages from the system. This is also available for binance marching and this is also be available on avalanche. It's going to be launched this week. The first product with avalanche.
00:06:35.070 - 00:06:41.050, Speaker A: Are all of the yield aggregator rewards in the native token or can somebody choose to take it in the.
00:06:41.120 - 00:07:02.782, Speaker B: For example on Ethereum all of them are getting ethereum. But on Bina smart chain they can choose, the users can choose between BNB, between Ethereum or DYP. And on avalanche the users are going to be able to choose between Avax of course between DYP or ethereum if they want Ethereum. So they have three different type of rewards.
00:07:02.926 - 00:07:05.022, Speaker A: Oh, that's wrapped Ethereum on Avax.
00:07:05.086 - 00:07:05.700, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:07.030 - 00:07:37.454, Speaker A: That's cool, man. This is a really cool project. And it's an interesting take on guild aggregators. I've seen a couple of different ones that are trying to take a different perspective. Can you talk a little bit about how, here's one thing that you said, it's an anti manipulation feature. So how does that work? Because you're selling rewards without affecting price too much. So what is that? How does that work? Let us get our heads around that because that's the secret sauce, right?
00:07:37.572 - 00:07:58.898, Speaker B: Yeah. We have a 2.5 slippage first. And after that for each of the contracts, based it on the number of the tokens, the rewards, the current liquidity. From that moment we have a number. It's called magic number. And this is done based on all of the things, on inflation, on the rewards.
00:07:58.898 - 00:08:09.100, Speaker B: And all of these numbers create the magic number. And when the swap happens, we have this number in consideration and the flippage. So this is how it works.
00:08:09.470 - 00:08:15.862, Speaker A: So it's built in to protect that price. So it's not just a super dump right away, it's not impossible.
00:08:15.926 - 00:08:35.178, Speaker B: No, it's impossible. You can even add 10 million of liquidity, for example, and the impact will be the same. It's not going to be bigger based on rewards. Okay. We cannot control the market because nobody cannot control the market. It's impossible. But we can control the part of the rewards distribution.
00:08:35.178 - 00:08:53.670, Speaker B: And this is the most important thing when it comes to yield farming, because even so, lately, I mean, after one year since this started, a lot of projects have this problem. They have a big apy, and in one, two days, three days, the price is down. And who is losing? The investors.
00:08:54.890 - 00:08:56.230, Speaker A: Well, and the projects themselves.
00:08:56.300 - 00:08:57.014, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:57.212 - 00:09:12.538, Speaker A: You get liquidity for two days and then you don't have any more. And then how do you incentivize your devs and your community as well? Yeah, we've got some great user questions here, so I'm going to start popping a couple of those on screen, if you don't mind. Is that cool?
00:09:12.624 - 00:09:13.782, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:09:13.856 - 00:09:27.074, Speaker A: All right, so I'm going to bring up what's the minimum amount of eth one can invest in? It's not a mining pool. So we should clarify that these are not mining pools, they're yield farming pools. Yes. So how does this work?
00:09:27.112 - 00:09:39.620, Speaker B: Can you address this question? Okay, so first of all, there is no minimum amount that you can invest. You can invest any amount. And secondly, it also works with Trustwallet. It works.
00:09:40.390 - 00:09:43.166, Speaker A: So you can connect trust wallet just like you can connect to metamask.
00:09:43.198 - 00:10:15.738, Speaker B: Yes, you can connect trustwallet just like you connect Metamask. But we had some users that, for example, when they are using from a mobile, they need to open the browser from inside the application, for example, from inside the metamask browser. And I think for Trustwallet on iOS, there is no browser available, only for Android, there is a browser built inside of the trustwallet application. So this could be an issue. The user said about the trustwallet users.
00:10:15.834 - 00:10:18.990, Speaker A: If people have problems with that, they should probably go to your discord or your telegram.
00:10:19.070 - 00:10:21.026, Speaker B: Yeah, of course we can help them.
00:10:21.128 - 00:10:47.878, Speaker A: Fantastic. And I also want to point out for this question, the minimum amount of ETh just for yield farming in general, something to be careful of is sometimes the gas fee to deposit into a smart contract can be high. And so if you're depositing $10 worth of ETH and the gas is $20, and you got to think sometimes there's like multiple steps you have to deposit and then stake. So just be aware of those sorts of things before you get halfway through your transaction.
00:10:47.974 - 00:11:01.040, Speaker B: Yes. But for example, this is why we offer the yield farming on binance marching, because the fees are low. And also the same thing will be on avalanche. So if anyone wants to invest a small amount, it's going to be okay.
00:11:01.730 - 00:11:09.300, Speaker A: All right, great. I've got another question. Somebody asked about an NFT. Are there?
00:11:10.310 - 00:11:29.270, Speaker B: Yes, yes. We have launched the NFT application, the first version I think one week ago or two weeks ago, something like this next Monday we are also going to launch a campaign for the users that are creating nfts on our platform and we are going to provide rewards.
00:11:29.950 - 00:11:33.690, Speaker A: So there's a big rewards component. What chain is the NFT platform on?
00:11:33.760 - 00:11:39.238, Speaker B: Right now it's on Ethereum, but it will also be available on binance marching and avalanche.
00:11:39.414 - 00:11:39.898, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:11:39.984 - 00:11:40.234, Speaker B: Cool.
00:11:40.272 - 00:11:53.262, Speaker A: See, I didn't even know about nfts. Thanks digital Babbitt. I appreciate that. I've got a couple of questions about the APY percentages. I'm going to send you guys to their website and to the communities to ask about specific financial numbers.
00:11:53.396 - 00:12:31.580, Speaker B: Also it's very easy when you go to our website on the homepage you can see the maximum API from that moment on the main page. Also they can see the total amount of Ethereum and BNB paid to the liquidity providers and the value in USD. And for this we are using Chainlink to show them the actual value, the real value in know because in the past we were using other aggregators, for example, not an oracle, we are using an aggregator like coingecko for example. But the price can be manipulated. Right now they can see the real value.
00:12:32.030 - 00:12:39.402, Speaker A: Awesome. Well that was my follow up question is how are you using Chainlink now? We know it's the price, your assets and your rewards in USD.
00:12:39.546 - 00:12:57.540, Speaker B: Yeah, other integrations are going to come in the future, but this is the first one. And this is very important because if a user comes to the website, they want to see the real value and they need to be sure that this is the real value because anyone can say, okay, we paid the 20 million, but how can you check that there are 20 million?
00:12:58.650 - 00:13:10.778, Speaker A: Fantastic. Okay, I've got another good question here. You covered this a little bit, but you mentioned there's not really a difference the way small depositors and large depositors are treated. How does that work?
00:13:10.944 - 00:13:35.362, Speaker B: It's the same thing. It doesn't matter if you are putting a low amount or a big amount, the staking or the yield farming. Because we were talking about the Yield farming works in the same way. It uses the same contracts, the same mechanisms. So it's the same thing. You cannot lose money because you invest a small amount and another user who invests a big amount. No, it's the same thing.
00:13:35.496 - 00:13:50.678, Speaker A: Yeah. So for yield aggregators, if the yield aggregator contract is farming one particular yield farm, all of the depositors are in the same pool, essentially, then that pool is used to farm that liquidity. So large and small investors are treated the same way.
00:13:50.764 - 00:14:13.230, Speaker B: Yeah. And right now, for example, on Ethereum, we have four pools. I mean, if you want to come with Ethereum, we have DYP. Ethereum, if you want to come with BTC, we have repBTC with DYP. And we also have USDC and USDT if you want to come with a stable coin. And sometimes it's better because the impaired money loss is lower when you add liquidity to stable pool.
00:14:14.450 - 00:14:33.342, Speaker A: All right, I got another question, Robert. This is a good one to, so I want to get this one out. It's. He asks, are we loaning link as a user? Are the users loaning link and earning eth? And what is it that you're depositing? It's not lending. Right. It's depositing liquidity, which is a different thing than lending.
00:14:33.486 - 00:15:07.074, Speaker B: Yeah, we also have lending. We can talk after that. We have a vault that it's working with compound protocol. But for the yield farming, they are just adding the liquidity on uniswap. The liquidity is used on uniswap and we have our own strategies and they get the rewards from us. So they are not lending link, loaning link and earning ethereum. But for example, I told you another product, it's the deepern vault and it supports Ethereum, BTC, USDC, USDT and DAI.
00:15:07.074 - 00:15:47.820, Speaker B: And it works directly with compound protocol. It is integration with compound protocol, but we are using some extra strategies and they can earn up to 23% per year. So it's much more than they would earn if they are putting the money directly to compound protocol. But it's the same thing. All of the funds are going to compound protocol plus our extra strategies. So this is another way of earning a passive income. If you just have USDT, for example, and you don't want to have the impermanent loss from money swap, you add the dollars, the USDT to the vault and you get the interest.
00:15:48.270 - 00:16:10.946, Speaker A: Yeah, these are sort of single sided staking vaults that are really interesting. If I'm a liquidity provider, I have to provide, let's just say link, for example, and ethereum in a pair to uniswap. And so if the price of either one of those shifts and is volatile. That's what's called impermanent loss. I'm subject to some risk there. There's all that. If you just deposit a stablecoin or one asset, you just deposit one thing.
00:16:10.946 - 00:16:28.738, Speaker A: And so some yield aggregators are doing that. And it sounds like DYP. This one is a question about yield farming in general that I think is a really pretty important one. Not just about DYP, but when more people are farming, does it affect the percentage of total earning?
00:16:28.914 - 00:16:42.686, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Because let's say you are in a pool and the pool has, I don't know, $10, the total reward. And we are ten people, we get one dollars each. But if we are 20 people this.
00:16:42.708 - 00:17:14.182, Speaker A: Is important because it's different than lending. In DFI lending and traditional lending, if there are people out to borrow then the demand of the borrowing for the funds, it doesn't matter how many the demand determines the rate. If people are willing to pay 20%, they're going to pay the lenders a premium for that. In yield farming there are rewards. There's usually a discrete amount of rewards. There's a pool of rewards and some protocol will say I've got $10 or a million dollars I'm going to give out to people who lp. If a million people join there's far fewer people.
00:17:14.182 - 00:17:22.246, Speaker A: If few people join there's a lot more to access that pool. So this is a really important distinction across different DFI primitives and protocols.
00:17:22.278 - 00:17:36.574, Speaker B: Yes. Also for the deeper vault that I told you, it doesn't matter when more people are, it's better because from our strategies they are earning more. But for yield farming it's different when they are more, they are earning less.
00:17:36.772 - 00:17:53.662, Speaker A: Oh that's interesting. It's better for yield aggregators to have more because you're pooling funds and so your stake in that is getting larger which lets you pay out more rewards to your users. Oh, that's cool. I hadn't thought of it in those terms. Hey, I haven't even reintroduced. We got really into this. This is fantastic.
00:17:53.662 - 00:18:21.514, Speaker A: Everybody, I'm here with Mihai from DYP. Really cool project. We jumped into the deep end of yield aggregators and why they work. I hope some of this has been educational for you. We've done some clarification as well. So I got a few more questions here and so if you have more questions go ahead and drop them in. Mihai is being kind enough to address those talking about them because they have integrated Chainlink to provide pricing information on their page.
00:18:21.514 - 00:18:33.070, Speaker A: So people know what their rate is in USD. And also there are cross chain and a bunch of places where chainlink is as well. Ethereum binance smart chain. And coming soon on avalanche.
00:18:33.430 - 00:18:34.180, Speaker B: Yes.
00:18:34.870 - 00:18:39.650, Speaker A: Here's a good question again from digital Babbitt. What is the DyP bridge?
00:18:40.150 - 00:19:04.970, Speaker B: Okay, so let's say you have tokens from binance marching and you want to move them to Ethereum. In this case, you need to use the DyP bridge and also vice versa if you want to move from ethereum to binance smart chain. And we have our own bridge. And this is also going to be available on avalanche. The same thing can happen. They can switch it between Ethereum and avalanche. And avalanche to Ethereum.
00:19:05.790 - 00:19:25.922, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. If you want to move tokens from one chain to another, it doesn't actually move them. It holds them in one place and opens them in another. That's what those bridges are doing right now. There are many solutions out there for proposing something slightly different. Is Chainlink fully integrated? So this is a great question to talk a little bit about how Chainlink price feeds work.
00:19:25.922 - 00:19:49.346, Speaker A: So the price feed oracles are native on Ethereum, they're native on binance smart chain. They're coming to mainnet on avalanche. And so a protocol such as DYP can go and access those contracts and make essentially like a call to the Oracle, what is the current price of ETh? Or what is the current price of BNB? And those are live on ETH and Binance.
00:19:49.378 - 00:19:49.960, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:50.510 - 00:20:05.066, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. Great questions. Juan knows this is a great audience and a great crew. I've got one more good one here. Is there an NFT marketplace coming? Is that something on your roadmap?
00:20:05.178 - 00:20:23.726, Speaker B: Yes, we already have it for Ethereum. They can find it on our website. It's very easy on the homepage. And pretty soon we are going to have it on avalanche and Binance smart chain. And if we are talking about our products, I would also like to talk about another product. It's one of my favorites.
00:20:23.918 - 00:20:29.814, Speaker A: Yeah. Please give us a little snapshot of the products and the roadmap, what's coming in a couple of months as well.
00:20:29.852 - 00:21:15.758, Speaker B: Okay, so we have the DYP tools. I don't know, if you check, it's, you can find any info about any DeFi project, but in a fully decentralized way. I mean, let's say you saw a project on Uniswap and you want to check it out. I don't know. It doesn't matter the name of the project. It can be a new project, an old project, you check it on DYP tools and you will see everything regarding liquidity transactions, a trust score, base it on a couple of things. And another important thing, for example, you go on, I don't know, coin, market cap or coingecko, and you search for link and you want to make a vote.
00:21:15.758 - 00:22:08.918, Speaker B: You can make a positive or negative vote, but anyone can make that vote. And lately I saw, and I think you also saw a lot of campaigns on Twitter, for example, they are running giveaways and they say, okay, you can earn $500 if you make a positive vote for this coin, something like this. And you like a new user or even an old user, you are checking that project and you see all of them positives, it's manipulated. For example, on DYP tools, if you want to make a vote for any project right now it's available only for Uniswap. For all of the projects from Uniswap, you can make a vote for that project, positive or negative, only if you are holding that token. We have a smart contract that is checking the metamask wallet, and if the wallet is holding that token, they can make a vote. It's free.
00:22:08.918 - 00:22:18.840, Speaker B: But you need to hold that vote because in our opinion, why should you be allowed to make a vote about a project that you're not holding? You have nothing to do with it.
00:22:19.850 - 00:22:50.690, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really interesting. Thinking about reputation. This is how governance works too, is you don't want just anybody voting on your protocol. You want people who have a stake in your protocol voting if you token holders, at least that's how governance is designed right now. So that's really interesting that you're doing it with sentiment. Can you bring that screen up, the DYp tools, just to show us real quick? And then while you get that ready, I'm going to address a question that Dina Carr's asked me. Well, hey, this is Andy Chainlink Labs.
00:22:50.690 - 00:23:05.830, Speaker A: I like a lot of defi protocols. I've been in the space for quite a while. I think the yield aggregators, farming, just the concept behind that, really changed the game last summer. I love what Dyp is doing with it. And Mihai and his gang.
00:23:07.450 - 00:23:08.614, Speaker B: Can you see the screen?
00:23:08.732 - 00:23:12.826, Speaker A: Yep. All right, bringing you up right here. So this is tools, right?
00:23:12.928 - 00:23:22.800, Speaker B: Yes, this is dyp tools. Let me show you something. This is the pool explorer. You are seeing all of the pool from uniswap in real time.
00:23:24.930 - 00:23:25.920, Speaker A: It's cool.
00:23:26.370 - 00:24:14.962, Speaker B: And let me show you, for example, let's search, I don't know, let's search for compound. For example, okay, I have my wallet connected. I'm not holding compound and I want to make a vote for compound. And you see here, buy some compound to vote. The voting process is free, but available only for compound holders. We have the DyP score right now the Dyp score is 100% decentralized and it's based on information on liquidity, on daily volume, liquidity provider holders, and the number of the transactions here, which is pretty cool.
00:24:15.016 - 00:24:24.920, Speaker A: This is a really nice tool. I had not seen so to the question earlier. I really like this tool. Dina Carr I like people voting with some stake in it.
00:24:27.130 - 00:24:43.130, Speaker B: The most important thing is that the voting, it's available only for that project holders. Here we can also see the big swap explorer, the latest big swaps.
00:24:46.430 - 00:24:48.250, Speaker A: These are large transactions.
00:24:48.690 - 00:25:36.886, Speaker B: Yes. The larger transactions. Here, for example, we can see again in a decentralized way the projects that were searched the most here when someone search on paid Explorer, we see here the most search project. Another unique product future of the DYP tools is the DYP locker. And I will give you an example. First, when we launch our project and we added the liquidity on Uniswap, we used another platform to lock the liquidity for the confidence of the users. And in our case we had four pools.
00:25:36.886 - 00:26:12.998, Speaker B: We paid one Ethereum for each pool. That means four ethereums and we paid 1% from the total value of the liquidity. So for Ethereum and 1%, they are last forever. We paid them to the protocol that we used to lock the liquidity in December, I believe it happened. Yes, in December. But with DYP locker it's free. And why do I say it's free? Let's say you want to lock 1 million liquidity, 1% from that.
00:26:12.998 - 00:26:25.180, Speaker B: Liquidity is going to be used as Ethereum to buy DYP. But when the liquidity gets unlocked, you get back the duip and you can sell it so it doesn't cost you anything.
00:26:26.430 - 00:26:27.226, Speaker A: Interesting?
00:26:27.408 - 00:26:28.458, Speaker B: Yeah, cool.
00:26:28.624 - 00:26:31.630, Speaker A: It's a different take on a buyback mechanism.
00:26:31.970 - 00:27:04.680, Speaker B: Yes. You get back everything. You don't lose nothing. Who knows, maybe the DYP tokens go up in one year and you also make some money, but you are just paying the transaction fee. That is almost zero. Also, all of the products from DYP tools are going to be available also on avalanche and binance smart chain here for example, any user can see all of the funds, they can find it here, it's easier and they can go directly, they can click and they can go.
00:27:07.390 - 00:27:08.140, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:27:08.510 - 00:27:25.360, Speaker B: Here is their account. Here we are going to have the launch pad that is also going to be available for avalanche and binance marching. And here we have for new projects. If they want to submit some info about their project.
00:27:26.690 - 00:27:27.102, Speaker A: Great.
00:27:27.156 - 00:27:31.578, Speaker B: Here you can buy DYP if they want. And here you can change the temp.
00:27:31.674 - 00:27:51.974, Speaker A: There we go. There's dark mode. I knew it was coming. We are running out of time. So we got a couple more great questions that I'm going to direct people to the discord and to the telegram. I've included the community channels for DYP down below in the description. So please go and join those and also join the chain link ones.
00:27:51.974 - 00:28:14.766, Speaker A: They're down below. Make sure you join the discord, join the telegram. There's always conversation about this going on, and there's lots of conversation about hackathons when they come up and how different protocols can integrate new strategies and things like that. So that's really how to start getting involved. For those of you who are here viewing with us today, and I appreciate you all being here. What a great crew. A bunch of really awesome questions as well.
00:28:14.766 - 00:28:23.342, Speaker A: Mihai, anything else from you? Thank you so much for being here. This has been a fantastic chance for me to get to know you and the protocol a little bit more.
00:28:23.476 - 00:28:38.754, Speaker B: Thank you very much for having me. It was a pleasure to have this chat with you and with the community. We had good questions and hopefully in the future we will have other chats. It was really nice.
00:28:38.952 - 00:29:05.642, Speaker A: Well, let's do a follow up once you integrate a few more chain link things, because I see a bunch of opportunities for that. And we talked at the beginning as well. There's an opportunity for keepers and more price feeds and all sorts of things. So we'll punt this conversation down the road for more integrations. That way, Robert, you can get your question answered and others of you as well. Hey, everybody, do me a favor, like and subscribe to this channel and this video. I do these videos chain link live a couple times a week.
00:29:05.642 - 00:29:22.130, Speaker A: I've got another one. No, I got two coming up tomorrow. So come in the morning and stay for the afternoon. Noon, hang out with me and the other chain link lab crew, Labs crew here on Chainlink Live. All right, everybody, that's it for me today. I'm out of here. We'll see you next time on Chainlink Live.
00:29:22.130 - 00:29:22.350, Speaker A: Bye.
