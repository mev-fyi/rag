00:00:02.970 - 00:00:47.670, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. William Riley, head of centralized finance partnerships, and very happy to bring on an excellent panel today of some elite actors in the liquid staking space. So with that, would you guys join me up here? Excellent. Excellent. Well, yeah, thanks for coming out. For starters, how about we just go down the line and do just a brief intro about yourself and the projects you work. Ernesto?
00:00:47.750 - 00:01:04.160, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm Ernestoado, I'm co founder of BGD Labs. Before I was CTO at Abe. And what BGD Labs is basically, we are developing. We are one of the main development contributors in the Abe protocol. So all things around Abe at the moment.
00:01:05.330 - 00:01:16.820, Speaker C: Awesome. Hi, my name is Marshmeet. I'm the co founder and CEO at Alluvial. We're the software development company behind the liquid collective protocol, a solution that's focused on bringing enterprise grade liquid staking to the market.
00:01:18.150 - 00:01:29.020, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Marin TVrdic, master of protocol relations, contributing to Lido Dao. Lido is ethereum liquid staking protocol for everyone.
00:01:29.790 - 00:01:44.750, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Omar Goldberg. I'm the founder and CEO of Chaos Labs. We do risk optimization, economic security and mechanism design for Defi protocols like Aave, Uniswap and Curve. Prior to that was a tech lead at Facebook and Instagram.
00:01:45.810 - 00:02:14.520, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. So, yeah, let's get into know liquid staking. Very hot topic in the market these days. And so let's start by diving into what makes liquid staking such a compelling cornerstone in Defi, and what kind of unique advantages is it really unlocking in the market? And I'd love to start with Lido and Alluvial's perspective here. Sure.
00:02:15.690 - 00:03:07.750, Speaker D: Obviously it had a perfect product market fit because for native staking, you need 32 eat. So it removed that barrier where you don't need to calculate each time for 32 eat. Then 32 eat, you can stake any amount you want, which is really good. And then ultimately it gives you ability to do two things at the same time. You can stake and still not lose liquidity of your eat. So it really gained traction because of that. Also, in terms of integrations, it helped to actually build on top and get cross integrated across multiple projects, basically where we all somehow met one way or another when we're trying to expand the access of the asset.
00:03:08.510 - 00:03:10.358, Speaker A: Perfect, Mara.
00:03:10.454 - 00:03:57.190, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah. I think of liquid staking protocols as actually two types of innovations. So the first one is issuing receipt tokens. You're just creating receipts on a staked position that comes with obvious benefits when you think about just a maturing financial ecosystem and the things that we use in day to day life as titles of ownership to be able to facilitate better capital, efficiency and other things. And so the token part itself is really something that we view as receipt that becomes accessible and tradable, that can be leveraged in both centralized and decentralized finance. And so that is obviously a significant and important primitive, I think as we look at the future of this innovation and the things and use cases that can come out of it.
00:03:57.190 - 00:04:38.100, Speaker C: The second part is the architecture around the protocol. And so you can think of this as staking pools that have any type of configuration or selection criteria, in most cases across a number of different node operators. And so when you think about the evolution and the design of protocols like Ethereum that actually have been designed to support anticorrelation strategies or move away from centralizing forces, I really think of this as a significant improvement to the security profile and accessibility that stakers have to using great solutions that have a diversified set of operators that they can stake their tokens through.
00:04:38.870 - 00:04:58.378, Speaker D: Also, one more thing, basically that we forgot. You need zero technical knowledge, right? You don't need to know how to run validators, how to set up your nodes, you don't need to have hardware at home or you don't need to rent it, you can just participate. So that's a major point there as well.
00:04:58.464 - 00:05:42.620, Speaker A: Yeah, excellent point. And with that, I would love to kind of dive into the difference in dynamics and perspectives when engaging the retail market as well as the institutional market. I know Lido has been in the space for some time now, very DeFi focused, alluvial is entering the space catering towards institutional folks, and I know Lido is doing the same. So I'd love to kind of explore the dynamics there and then with that, go into what are the kind of demand perspectives that we're seeing from folks like Ave and the folks that you work with at BGD. So just kind of open it up to that topic. Sure.
00:05:43.070 - 00:06:39.930, Speaker D: So that's actually a good standpoint to look at it from individual or retail perspective. You're targeting as many use cases as possible, and users are the ones who actually decide how exposed to risk they want to be. It's all up to them. When you look enterprise or institutional, it's completely different narrative. Enterprises need to have additional business models on top of the asset. Institutions need to have models how to actually gain rewards and make it sustainable, because end of the day they need to occur some revenue around it to be able to cover base cost, but not only that, to be able to expand the businesses and to be able to actually invest in research, for example, or growth. So those are completely two different narratives.
00:06:39.930 - 00:06:56.290, Speaker D: What is the cool part about it? That with Lido protocol, it somehow found fit in both? True, it started as a DeFi retail product, but over time it really evolved into institutional grade protocol.
00:06:57.430 - 00:06:59.918, Speaker A: Thank you, Mara.
00:07:00.014 - 00:08:15.302, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think liquid staking from a research perspective came to be around 2019, 2020. I think Rocket pool was the really early starter there. I think you guys launched in December 2020, January 2021. And of course, I think as most things in crypto, or just in general, new evolving technologies enthusiasts were, I think some of the first adopters. And I think Lido's done an incredible job bringing on know crypto native retail participants and giving them access and opportunity to partake. As someone who's actually been building a lot of enterprise grade products for the market for the last couple of years and working within Coinbase, I actually realized we were running into some issues, figuring out how to build a standardized, scalable, liquid staking product that would take into consideration the needs that we would have as a publicly listed us business and the needs that our customers would have, registered institutions, hedge funds, structured product providers, atps. And so the biggest barriers that we saw were the solutions that were available in the market were challenging for us to implement.
00:08:15.302 - 00:09:15.120, Speaker C: From a commercial standpoint, we found it very difficult to reconcile the permissionless architectures of a lot of these protocols with the compliance department's requirements that we had to observe things like sanctions compliance and all that good and boring stuff. And last but not least, it felt really important to have observability into counterparty risk, and so understanding where node operators are based, what security posture they hold, really having more visibility into how the configuration of an active set works. And so, coincidentally, at the time when Coinbase started thinking about this, a lot of other players in the market also started thinking about this, including companies like Kraken and Figment, and a lot of other partners I was working with at the time. And we actually decided to partner to build a product that was going to be able to meet a lot of these requirements. And that's really how we came to be. I'm really excited for us to hopefully build solutions that help us expand across loads of different segments in the market.
00:09:15.650 - 00:09:26.320, Speaker A: Excellent. Thank you. And then Ernesto over at BGD, what kind of demand signals are you seeing in regards to adoption of liquid staking on platforms? Like.
00:09:28.290 - 00:10:24.382, Speaker B: Think it's more. I will go more high level on that. At the end of the day, a protocol like Ave gives kind of superpowers to tokens, because it gives immediate liquidity when there is transitions, like as important as from proof of work to proof of stake. On Ethereum itself, a protocol like Apple needs some kind of middleware, which will be the lsts. And that basically unlocks all this potentiality, like in the underlying new consensus mechanisms. So I think that is just the key of the lsts. It becomes like the use case appear by itself, because your eth needs to be validating, at least in a big percentage, so that by itself is like what creates this demand on the lsts.
00:10:24.526 - 00:10:41.382, Speaker A: Excellent. Thank you. And then, Omar, over at chaos, we can't forget about risk, and I know that's your ballgame. So can you dive into what type of primary and secondary risk that folks should be aware of and how you approach that over at chaos?
00:10:41.526 - 00:11:52.298, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. So, just to add to what Ernesto said and what everyone else on the panel has said, the launch of velsts from a financial perspective, and in a second, I'll talk about risk, was pretty big, because what it introduced was essentially the closest thing that we have today to risk free rates. Now for investors or people trying to understand what to do with their capital, since this is risk free, this becomes now the benchmark to measure everything against. And I'll speak about the risks that we perceive when we go about setting risk parameters and protocols like Ave. But we'll also say that the market prices these pretty safely, as you can see, in the exchange rate. Now, let's break down the risks and the type of things that we look at when we decide whether or not to onboard an LST token onto a borrow lend protocol, or to any other type of defi instrument like perps. The first and foremost, there's a counterparty and regulatory risk that varies by the entity running the protocol, and you need to look at each case individually.
00:11:52.298 - 00:12:48.770, Speaker E: But in addition to that, you have kind of the primary and secondary risk. So the first risk here is redemption, I would say. I mean, before that, you also have smart contract risk and whether or not you can actually redeem them. But putting that aside, you have redemption risk. So when there is a rush to redeem lsts at once, the queue and the time to redemption gets longer. Now, the longer that that time is going to be, it stands to reason that the LST is going to trade at a negative premium. Now, this is potentially problematic because a lot of DeFi protocols, price lsts, at least the widely accepted ones in rap, staked eth at a constant or close to constant exchange rate, and it can have ripple effects on the ecosystem, like cascading liquidations and so on, depending on how you're setting those liquidation thresholds.
00:12:48.770 - 00:13:31.120, Speaker E: We haven't actually seen this because since, I guess, LSTs have been released to the market, we're seeing the inverse. People are depositing, depositing, depositing. So we haven't seen many stress cases or have many historical events for reference to help and build data driven statistical models. So right now, the approach from a risk perspective is very exploratory. We're trying to understand this instrument, the risks. We want more data points on what redemptions and the premiums that these tokens trade at. So it's very much working closely with the protocol developers and the protocols who are accepting the LSTs as liquidity in the protocol and thinking about the best ways to onboard them.
00:13:31.570 - 00:14:06.060, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, great perspective on that. Now, something I'm clearly passionate about is how Chainlink really enables services within the market. And I've been working closely with a number of liquid staking providers such as you folks. We'd love to just kind of get your perspective of what type of impacts chainlink services have in the market from your point of view. We have data feeds, proof of reserve, CCIP. So maybe current day impact, and maybe how you see evolving with these new products.
00:14:08.750 - 00:15:21.982, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's quite interesting case, because at the very beginning of LST, when the full transition to proof of stake on ethereum didn't happen, Chainlink was really fundamental and price oracles in general, really fundamental for the reusage of these tokens in platforms like avid, because there was a really big asymmetry on the asset. So the way that, for example, price oracles update how the chain link technology works really help to protect DeFi protocols and not be submitted to, for example, really aggressive market movements on decentralized exchanges and so on. Now we enter a bit different stage on where everything is more symmetrical, which is in general better. But the new challenges are things like Omar mentioned, that we maybe are getting a bit too overconfident about the price of the asset because it feels really safe. And what I think is that in the future, Chainlink will play quite big role on more sophisticated pricing mechanisms.
00:15:22.126 - 00:15:28.690, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you. Yeah, we'll just go down the line. Mara, do you have any thoughts on this topic?
00:15:28.850 - 00:16:08.946, Speaker C: Sure, yeah. I mean, we're still seeing it today. I think Oracle support and integrations are quite fundamental in supporting different adoption use cases, particularly in DeFi. I think for us, it's been really interesting to configure sort of our environment against the most prominent use cases that we're supporting today, which I would probably classify as enterprise institutional, getting ready, but not super ready to act in DeFi yet, and building the railways to support that, and support more and more flow and accessibility in that side of the market.
00:16:09.128 - 00:16:11.090, Speaker A: Excellent. Thank you, Mark.
00:16:11.240 - 00:17:09.906, Speaker D: I mean, price feed wise market leader that actually kick started the growth of St e or repstact eat. Essentially, if you observe the timelines, true adoption of repstate eat or state Ethereum happened when it got accepted as a collateral on Ave, because it started to be part of much more capital efficient strategies compared to plain stake and hold. And it was the beginning. From there, things started to be more exploratory, but then riskier. Obviously, as with each layer, you add additional risk and there's where a good and high quality oracle is really important. But to put it out there, obviously with your conservative approach, I think you did well to limit the growth, because it really was true. Everyone was just staking, staking, staking.
00:17:09.906 - 00:17:19.030, Speaker D: No one cared about withdrawals. So in combination, I guess we can say we are achieving high level of market maturity.
00:17:20.090 - 00:17:23.030, Speaker A: Thank you. And then, Omar, from the risk perspective.
00:17:23.110 - 00:18:31.630, Speaker E: Yeah, first of all, second, everything that was said here, I think from a more technical perspective, we spend a lot of time with Chainlink on understanding what is behind the actual prices that are reported on chain. So, to Ernesto's point, early on, before the migration to proof of stake, essentially what we were seeing in most of the largest DeFi curve pools was a DPEG in the staked ETH price in comparison to wrap staked ETH, and that would be considered the secondary market price. When we work with Chainlink Oracles, we use the primary market price, which basically looks at the issued staked ETH in circulation against the used staked ETH with the rewards. And that gives what you could call like the real price. So even if there are momentary dpegs in secondary markets, it's not going to be the accelerant to cascading liquidations unnecessarily if we see a dip in a pool. So that's been really big. The other thing is proof of reserves, which is something new that we're seeing become a best practice and standard in the industry.
00:18:31.630 - 00:19:07.670, Speaker E: Essentially what I said, looking at the issuance and circulating supply of an LST or staked ETH, is one step in getting that real price feed. But what Chainlink is also offering with proof of reserves is actually querying all the nodes and ensuring that the amount reported in circulating supply matches the amount that has been deposited to be staked, essentially, which is another layer of security guarantees. So, yeah, Chainlink has been huge in allowing us to be less conservative in the risk parameters across DeFi, to allow adoption while still protecting the users.
00:19:07.830 - 00:19:24.594, Speaker D: But it did level the playground in terms of proof of reserve with DeFI and CFI, because in DeFI, everything is transparent and on chain. And then when in CFI, you have that ability to go under collateralized and be more riskier, but now everything is more transparent. So that was really good.
00:19:24.712 - 00:20:07.274, Speaker A: Yeah. Amazing. Thank you. And personally, I'm very excited about cross chain interoperability as well. CCIP coming to market as the gold standard of security for bridging and creating unified liquidity across chains for native asset minting. So I'm very excited to see that and be a part of driving that into the market. Now, we have a little bit of time left and would like to kind of dive in with chaos and bgd around any type of happenings around creating a standardized framework and more specifically a framework for lsts and risk.
00:20:07.274 - 00:20:15.700, Speaker A: And should there be a standard or should there be more bespoke approaches and kind of, why should we go down one path or another?
00:20:16.870 - 00:21:01.354, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I can go first. I don't know if I agree with Omar on this or not. I think it's pretty difficult to say at the moment. Like almost always, if there should be or there will be a standard or not. Because to put as an example, like the way Abe prices, like certain lsts, is just different compared with other protocols which are kind of similar. So I will say that at this stage, it's even a differentiation point, because you need a lot of analysis, you need contributors to dows, you need a lot of work to actually design the best strategy for the particularities of your protocol. So I think it's ideal.
00:21:01.354 - 00:21:35.818, Speaker B: Yeah. For the sake of the scale of lsts, when that is going to happen, it's a bit difficult to predict, because also lsts, we tend to think that it's just the eth lsts, but it's not the case anymore. There is pretty big native assets of other networks which have their equivalent lsts, and they are pretty different in substance compared with others. So hopefully, yes, there will be a standard. I would like that. But difficult to say when or how.
00:21:35.984 - 00:21:37.350, Speaker A: Thank you, Omar.
00:21:37.510 - 00:22:35.294, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree. So I'll just say this. I think that there are some things which should be standardized and should be considered a best practice, but there's no silver bullet and you can't capture everything because ultimately the underlying protocols behave differently. Like even on the panel we have here, alluvial and Lido, that if we were speaking about regulatory or counterparty concerns, they're very different because the protocol's mechanism and underlying operating structure is different. So there's no rule of thumb that you can use for everything. On the other hand, there are heuristics that you could use not only for lsts, but start to say things like, we don't want more than 10% of any token being deposited directly in a protocol like Ave, let's say 70% or 60%. The number can fluctuate because we want to have some upper bound to the protocol's exposure in the case that one of the risk vectors that we discussed earlier goes wrong.
00:22:35.294 - 00:22:45.040, Speaker E: So I think it can be delineated into things which should be standardized and best practices. But obviously there's a lot of nuance that's needed here because there's a lot of nuance to each of the protocols that are being built.
00:22:45.490 - 00:23:48.210, Speaker C: And just to hop in here too, I mean, we're spending a ton of time on this topic. The more time we're spending on it, the more clear it's becoming to us that we actually don't yet have a suite of standardized metrics, which is like phase one of even being able to compare risk across different protocols. So while I definitely agree on systemic risk, best practices considerations around exposure, I think fundamentally one of the biggest risks that everyone is really trying to mitigate is smart contract concern and then issues around potential flashings. Right. And so one of the things that is emerging now as a comparable metric so that we can back into things like a risk adjusted reward rate equivalent would actually is going to matter eventually. Are things like, what is the distribution of clients, what is the distribution of geographical regions, what is the mixture of on prem to cloud deployment so that we can effectively mitigate correlated slashing. So some of these things are, I think, fundamental in shaping everyone's understanding and being able to make educated decisions about when they want to participate.
00:23:48.210 - 00:23:57.430, Speaker C: And for what it's worth, I think restaking and other innovations only make that even more important for us to understand and make an educated choice around.
00:23:57.580 - 00:24:14.858, Speaker A: Very good. Thank you for that perspective. And as we kind of close things off, I think I'll just toss this one to Marin. But what's next on the horizon for liquid staking? If you're going to look into the future for the next few years, where do you think we're heading?
00:24:15.034 - 00:25:13.486, Speaker D: So I think it will start the domination against the native staking because of all that we discussed today. I think it will start to have threat tech adoption because it simplifies entrance to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. You don't need to be vastly knowledgeable. You can just interact through a more web two and traditional experiences that everyone is familiar with. I also think that a lot of cool things will happen because DFI ecosystems can't depend on validator emissions. So we are seeing a huge amount of research efforts into restaking sourcing rewards from alternative angles, and LSTFI that's being built on top of the assets will be the future. We can look at liquid stake tokens as primitives now.
00:25:13.668 - 00:25:24.890, Speaker A: Amazing. More users sound better to me too, as well. Well, I had a great time. Thank you for joining me today on this panel. And yeah, that was the future of liquid staking.
