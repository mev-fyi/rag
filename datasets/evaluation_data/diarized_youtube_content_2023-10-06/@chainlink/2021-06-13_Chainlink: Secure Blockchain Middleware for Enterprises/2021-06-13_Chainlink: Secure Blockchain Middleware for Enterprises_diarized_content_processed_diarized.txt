00:00:00.330 - 00:01:50.060, Speaker A: And if everyone's going to want yield, if everyone's going to want to use DeFi, then the next logical step for all the banks and fintechs and everybody who's involved in custody right now is to be thinking about, well, how will I interact with DeFi protocols? And how will I interact with various DeFi protocols on various chains? The answer we have to that is that they should acquire a secure blockchain middleware that's integrated with many different chains and can give them easy access to many different DeFi protocols from one integration. And that's actually what Chainlink is for enterprises. So for public blockchains and for issuers, for creators of smart contracts, whether they're on public or private blockchains, the Chainlink network creates these decentralized Oracle networks, each of which creates its own singular decentralized service for enterprises that don't necessarily want to issue things, but they do want to connect to various blockchains and various DeFi protocols. Chainlink is actually a secure blockchain middleware that allows them to interact with the various chains. And the fascinating thing is actually how this dynamic works together. If the initial dynamic of our industry was custody and ownership and acquiring tokens that people feel have value, and the next dynamic is various fast moving fintechs and crypto startups building advanced financial products that then put pressure on banks and fintechs to also build financial products, then the third dynamic is the enablement of the various institutions and enterprises that actually do want to use the Internet of value and Internet of contracts to successfully generate not only custody, but financial products for their user base, which, which once again is something that they're primarily driven by.
