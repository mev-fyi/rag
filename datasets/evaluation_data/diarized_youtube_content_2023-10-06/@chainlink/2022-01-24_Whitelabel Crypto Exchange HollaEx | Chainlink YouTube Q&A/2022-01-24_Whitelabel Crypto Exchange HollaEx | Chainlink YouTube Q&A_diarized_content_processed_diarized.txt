00:00:06.730 - 00:00:15.710, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, welcome to Chainlink Live. We're talking Defi with Holla X. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs, and I've got Ali from Holla X here. Ali, how are you doing, man?
00:00:15.860 - 00:00:19.326, Speaker B: I'm doing good. Thanks for having me. Pleasure to be here.
00:00:19.428 - 00:00:40.700, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited to talk to you. I said little at the top in the intro. I used to work for a white label fintech company, and so I'm kind of aware of the space. It's been a few years and we were not in crypto. So I'm really interested in learning more about Holox and kind of how you guys position yourself, what that market looks like. So let's get started. Just tell us, what is Holox? What kind of makes it special? How do you guys stand out?
00:00:41.470 - 00:01:36.300, Speaker B: Well, so Holox is a technology allowing businesses to run their own crypto exchange. It's a white label solution based on an open source software called Holox Kit, which is essentially a suite of tools and really important essentials for doing anything crypto related, put all together in this kit that allows you as a business to get things started, get your hands dirty, and basically ultimately be able to run a crypto exchange with all the features and trading and all that sort of stuff. So we pretty much put it all into one nice suite of software, consolidated a lot of different interesting features that are pretty common for businesses, and built that over time. So it's been around about five years, been developing it to get it to where we are today.
00:01:38.190 - 00:02:00.820, Speaker A: This is really for developers ctos to kind of look at and say, hey, if we want to build this product, we can build it from the ground up, or we could use kind of some training wheels and get started. Let's say I'm a developer. I am not, by the way, but as a developer, what's sort of the real value add that I'm looking at as using a holox instead of building something on my own.
00:02:01.670 - 00:03:06.950, Speaker B: Well, as a developer, you pretty much, you could go to GitHub, to the GitHub repository and clone the repo, and then you've got these beautiful set of tools as a software that you can utilize for building crypto related stuff. So we kind of try to keep it very simple and very sort of flexible, very developer friendly, because that's where really the real value is. And as a developer, you can take those features and functionalities and instead of starting from scratch, you don't have to really reinvent the wheel with Holo X. Pretty much. And you can get to a pretty close production level by just doing few commands here and there. So developers in general find it very interesting because it's kind of built with that mentality. I mean, I'm a tech guy myself, and we come from tech background, so we really wanted to make sure that developers get really what they want and be able to build on top of it.
00:03:06.950 - 00:03:11.690, Speaker B: That's the whole point of these types of solutions.
00:03:13.790 - 00:03:33.594, Speaker A: That's cool, man. It's always really interesting to me. I'm a writer, I'm a content creator. And so I think about like, I'm going to invent my own thing, this brand new original idea. But really, if I really want to ship something, I use an outline. I use like a format that somebody's used before. This is how to do an AMA, this is how to do it, this is how to write a novel.
00:03:33.594 - 00:04:06.380, Speaker A: Like if you're doing that, is like, there are pathways set that people have figured out this is just a smarter way to go about doing so. It makes a lot of sense to use a base of code that's already there to get to where you want to go faster and do kind of then those unique things that you want to do to stand out, you do those on your own. You use your developer resources there as well. Bhakti is asking a good question about why Chainlink? Let's dive into that. So I work for Chainlink Labs and Chainlink and Halax, did an integration announcement a little while ago. How are you using Chainlink in?
00:04:08.590 - 00:04:58.566, Speaker B: I mean, with all the sort of exchange and trading and stuff, one important thing really is the price. Where do you get the price source? And it's a challenging question. It's kind of a simple thing to think about. You're like, well, get the price. What's such a big deal about? Why are you making a big deal about it? But in reality, you need different price sources and you need to find ways where you can get a price of an asset. And with chain link, I mean, connected to all these different, having all these tokens and all these defi coins and things integrated, it's just pretty much a simple one interface for getting prices of these different assets. So that's primarily the usage of it in different places.
00:04:58.566 - 00:05:16.340, Speaker B: Like for example, you want to see your portfolio. How do you calculate what is the price of these assets? And then they tend to change very dramatically. So you kind of want to have a pretty decent prices to feed to your customers, essentially. And that's the primary use case.
00:05:18.070 - 00:06:31.834, Speaker A: I love this use case for Chainlink, for our white label a lot of times. So Chainlink price feeds, they're oracles and so they can trigger smart contracts, but we're seeing more centralized exchanges or white label exchange models in your case, adopt these price feeds not because they trigger a smart contract, but because they're super well aggregated. They access an incredible amount of price feeds across hundreds of exchanges and they're aggregated by dozens of nodes and then they come to an aggregation and submit that price. Which if you're like a startup exchange and you're using a white label and you don't have a lot of liquidity right now, maybe your prices aren't representing market average, right? Your bitcoin price maybe is just trading off compared to some of the major exchanges that have a lot more liquidity. And so to access price feeds that are grabbing, chain link feeds are grabbing from all sorts of decentralized exchanges centralized all over the place. It could be a real game changer and give people those accurate prices because if your prices are way off, then who's trading on you, right? Like, oh, I'm not getting a good price here, or it's way too volatile or something like that. That could really impact your clients who are now adopting Holox in that way.
00:06:31.834 - 00:06:34.742, Speaker A: So I really like that use case totally.
00:06:34.806 - 00:07:19.894, Speaker B: I mean, it's also a matter of reliability. You need a reliable source of these price oracles, as you said, primarily you use it in smart contracts and stuff. But having a reliable source of price feed is actually a very useful thing. I know that I can call that query and I can get the price immediately and that's reliable. I mean, that's a huge deal. So it can be utilized for a lot of different services, including ours. So we want to make sure that the prices that people see or by any forms, as I said, even my wallet, what's the estimate value of my coin or whatever, these are some basic simple examples.
00:07:19.894 - 00:07:39.482, Speaker B: And obviously we use different aggregate of different price sources to make sure the prices are pretty close to the average. But I mean, Chainlink has a pretty reliable price source for us that we integrated with. So that's a pretty good thing to have essentially for a white label exchange solution.
00:07:39.626 - 00:08:07.426, Speaker A: Yeah. When I first got link build, I learned about the reliability and it's like this subtle thing you don't think about unless you're a developer and you've experienced API outages or whatever it is. And then there's this core user interface element or this corporate element to your product that just is gone. Sometimes it's not there. It's like you can't run a product that way. And so, yes, absolutely, we have hyper reliable feeds here. There's a really good post about data quality from Chainlink.
00:08:07.426 - 00:08:30.634, Speaker A: I'll look it up and drop it in the chat in a minute for y'all. Hey, everybody, we do have a number of people here. My name is Andrew from Chainlink Labs. I'm talking to Ali from Holox white label crypto exchange product. They've integrated Chainlink price feeds and we're just kind of getting into why and what it's all about. I've got a number of other questions, too, and I will get to your earlier question as well, bakhti, later. If you guys have questions, feel free to drop them in the chat.
00:08:30.634 - 00:09:10.090, Speaker A: We'll go through them. Let's talk a little bit about white label solutions because are there a lot of white label solutions in crypto? Most of web3, it really feels bespoke. A developer just gets an idea. I'm still remembering DFI summer when it was just like, we're going to make mushroom DFI, we're going to make Badger DFI or whatever it was. And people kind of just got on this food kick for a while. But the tech industry historically shows us there is a demand on the long tail for platforms and white label solutions for fintech apps. That's clearly a market kind of differentiator as the industry matures.
00:09:10.090 - 00:09:15.470, Speaker A: So what's kind of the story of white label solutions in crypto? What does that look like right now?
00:09:15.620 - 00:10:17.566, Speaker B: Well, I mean, there is definitely an increasing demand for white label solutions. Like, people want to utilize well made, solid technologies that are already out there instead of really reinventing the wheel. White label solutions in crypto, they've been around for a very long time, and over time it got more and more mature, that the needs requirements got clearer, people want really clear things and really solid infrastructure. And that sort of stuff led us to where we are here now. I'd say one thing that is really interesting about crypto is unlike traditional finance because it was sort of like it was a used one, is kind of closed. Like, there are few gatekeepers. Most of the software you see in the traditional financial space with fintech apps and stuff, they are all based on integrations or there are a few gatekeepers.
00:10:17.566 - 00:10:45.110, Speaker B: So you can't really do much. You can't really dig deep enough to create some cool stuff. But that's not really the case with crypto. We have this open infrastructure with different crypto assets and blockchain and stuff. And you can really do different things. Like sky is the limit when it comes to ideas. So that kind of gives a very fresh view over things that you can do, like different use cases.
00:10:45.110 - 00:11:38.154, Speaker B: And people get really creative so that creativity and all these ideas are cool, but you need to be able to execute. And that's where the sort of white label solutions and stuff comes in. And that really gives the edge. I can easily execute. I can actually build something. I can build my idea without a lot of trouble. And that's kind of interesting, I would say, because of the open sort of nature of crypto, we have a pretty growing demand for solid software solutions, that people have these variety of different ideas that didn't exist before simply because they couldn't really have access to that.
00:11:38.154 - 00:12:06.926, Speaker B: So that is something really refreshing. And I think it's kind of new for the whole financial sector moving forward. All these open protocols and open source software, even open source software, I mean, just think about it. An open source software like in a traditional finance, it just doesn't make any sense. They typically tend to secure their software and secure their services by obscurity. They didn't want to share that. But we have a totally different approach in crypto.
00:12:06.926 - 00:12:42.720, Speaker B: It's like everything is open. You can build the stuff on top of it and then people do reviews and check the code. That sort of stuff really helps building this sort of infrastructure. So as a result of that, we are definitely seeing a very growing demand, particularly from a lot of businesses after last year and all these new use cases that came out with nfds and things like that. So people are really pushing different fronts and are looking into creating different things, which is quite interesting.
00:12:43.170 - 00:13:24.406, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look at Bloomberg terminals. That model is based on sell you like a piece of hardware, and then there's this proprietary software infrastructure background and information aggregator. And that was the standard model. And that's just for information, right. Not the platforms themselves. And this open Internet standards, open source information coding, all of that kind of leans into that and pushing that and challenging that. One of the other things I was thinking of with having a white label as I was wondering about as different regions kind of come, like if a spark, one region says, okay, we're going to allow crypto.
00:13:24.406 - 00:13:54.262, Speaker A: Now we weren't before India, right? Like we weren't sure about it, now we're allowing it. There can be like a burst of activity in some of these regions all of a sudden. And so for somebody to make a crypto exchange, for example, okay, now that we have clarity, let's start. And then you build for twelve months. Come on, you want to start and be ready to ship as fast as you can to kind of be a market leader there and you don't want to ship janky software. It feels like it's an opportune moment to have stuff that's kind of out of the box. Excuse me, still early for me.
00:13:54.262 - 00:14:22.010, Speaker A: Stuff that's out of the box and ready to go, because so many of these different jurisdictions are like switching on a dime. And if I'm, I'm based in the US, and so my banking infrastructure for a crypto exchange is very different than somebody in India and Korea and Qatar, Qatar and wherever it happens to be. And so each different place might need to have a different sort of backend ready to spin up at any given moment. Do you see a lot of that differentiation among jurisdictions?
00:14:22.170 - 00:14:57.130, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, each country is sort of different. There are different crypto regulation, crypto mandate, there are different things going on everywhere, and they have different infrastructure. In fact, some countries don't have much of an infrastructure. I mean, a lot of countries in Africa, there's not much that is already built from the traditional financial sector. But time to market is a really important thing. You mentioned that it takes minimum, like a year to really develop something that is presentable in the market.
00:14:57.130 - 00:16:04.362, Speaker B: And then you add all the security, you add all the tests and all that stuff. It's literally something that takes years to develop a solid infrastructure and connecting that with existing systems and infrastructure, all that integration, it's kind of a really challenging thing to actually do. But over time, because we work with a lot of different companies, different businesses in different countries, you get a lot of experience, like, how do people do stuff? And one interesting thing is with crypto, there's a pretty clear open protocol. You essentially use that as the standard protocol infrastructure, and then you build on top of that. So all these additional features, we call them plugins. Like, we created a marketplace for plugins and development. There's like an open community of developers who utilize and develop these plugins, some of which are like, you have to pay the developer to give you the plugin that is developed and that sort of stuff.
00:16:04.362 - 00:16:54.098, Speaker B: It kind of creates this open environment and allows you to add these plugins on top of that infrastructure. So the traditional finance, I think when you think about the infrastructure, it's kind of like unclear. Like each country has its own thing, but with blockchain, with crypto, you've got a very solid ground that you can build upon. So now you can start adding really cool stuff on top of it. So what we did is we have this open plugin marketplace and a pretty interesting developers community where a lot of these features are done, for example, like different languages. Holox kit already supports like 15 different languages by default in the kit, so you can do all that. And that access is something really interesting.
00:16:54.098 - 00:17:28.140, Speaker B: So you kind of don't have to go through all that process from scratch. You can use a lot of things and features that are already thought out, and a lot of it is common. I mean, you'd be surprised. There are different countries, they do different things, but at the end of the day, the core of what people want and businesses really want is quite similar. So that's definitely something that we look very closely and provide services around that.
00:17:28.990 - 00:17:49.362, Speaker A: What does the addressable market look like right now? What do you guys have in mind? Everybody has a hal x exchange, of course. But is it five exchanges per country? Is it people just spinning them up for just, what does it look like a little bit as you guys move forward and really come to market?
00:17:49.496 - 00:18:09.382, Speaker B: So, I mean, initially it used to be called bitcoin exchange. We didn't have a crypto exchange. It was just a Bitcoin exchange. It was only bitcoin. And that was it like bitcoin. And then maybe like a fiat currency or something. Over time, we had all these other coins and all these other assets, and then we have stable coins.
00:18:09.382 - 00:18:39.042, Speaker B: And then it just grew and became way more mature. And now it's like a crypto exchange. But with that, there has been a lot of different demand in different sectors. It's not just a crypto exchange. So when we think about a crypto exchange, it's not just a crypto to crypto or crypto to fiat, like exchange. It's like tokens. If you're a company, you want to offer some interesting fan token or something, you could utilize this.
00:18:39.042 - 00:19:53.850, Speaker B: If you have an NFD and then you want to put bids and asks for your NFD, you want to sell it like an auction, for example, or that sort of stuff, you could utilize the exchange. So the number of different sort of use cases, it's just pretty much like a sky is the limit. We just see some interesting use cases. Some people come to us and they have these different ideas, and then we're amazed by what are the things that people could actually make. It's really beyond just like countries, and it's very global. So there are a lot of different sort of ideas initially, we're thinking just like that, this is going to be like one or two exchanges per country, and then how many exchanges can we have? But as we saw it sort of growing and then looking at it now, it's really way beyond just like a crypto fiat exchange. And people really push it into different directions, which is what makes it really special and unique.
00:19:53.850 - 00:20:23.906, Speaker B: So I don't think there is any limit to that. You could get really creative and then come up with all these different ideas, and whatever you can think of, you can somehow create sort of an incentive model around it, put it in some kind of a fungible or non fungible with nfds, form of a token or something, and then have it traded one way or the other. And that's how truly open the market is.
00:20:24.088 - 00:21:00.000, Speaker A: Yeah, markets are one of these social laws that keep emerging. Markets exist, right? The way people kind of organize in social structures, markets are one of them. And they happen kind of no matter what you do. And so to enable a place for people to have markets that fit in with people's technology needs and understanding, and the way you access everything, I think is really fantastic because markets are going to happen, right? They're going to come to life, where are they going to happen, what kind of infrastructure are they going to use and let people do whatever markets they're going to make on there? I think that's cool.
00:21:00.370 - 00:21:35.578, Speaker B: It's like a venue, right? Like people gather and then they do something. Whatever it is, I can't tell. People do all sorts of different things, and that's really what an exchange is. And now that's automated. And whatever that they're doing, it can be put in a digital form in a very global way that is very easy to use and utilize. So that's what really an exchange is. So sky is the limit when it comes to different things that you can build around it.
00:21:35.744 - 00:21:51.360, Speaker A: That's awesome. I've got one question from our audience. Bhakti has an idea, and so wants to ask a little bit about Hallx. Do you provide grants, or do you guys have some sort of organizational community outreach system? Give us a little insight into that process.
00:21:52.370 - 00:22:29.418, Speaker B: We definitely mean we support really interesting ideas, and we've had different projects where they had different sort of interesting ideas. It really depends on what you're looking to get. I can share the links, and you can directly contact the team, and then we can help you basically build around the idea. And we definitely do do that stuff. And there's a pretty thriving community. We have a community on discord there are a lot of developers. Everyone is looking for cool stuff.
00:22:29.418 - 00:22:36.240, Speaker B: You can find other people that actually are willing to even help you. So there's also that that could be interesting.
00:22:36.850 - 00:22:55.140, Speaker A: All right, cool. I'm sure we have the link to the discord down below. If we don't, I will double check and get it there for sure. So Bhakti, head there and start making friends. Aliyah will be there and maybe he'll guide you or somebody there will guide you to find the right people to talk to for grants and getting set up. What's on the roadmap for Hallx? What do you guys have coming up in the next few months?
00:22:56.250 - 00:23:43.118, Speaker B: So, I mean, we are pretty feedback driven. We're at the stage that we have. A lot of these businesses have been growing and they build like a pretty thriving business around their model. So we're very feedback driven to the features and things that a lot of businesses want, the features that community wants. Crypto is like, it always has something new to offer. So we're just trying to always stay out of the game, make sure that we fulfill things that new cutting edge tech and stuff that comes in. We have constantly new blockchains, new things happening in the crypto space, new integrations, different features.
00:23:43.118 - 00:24:00.566, Speaker B: And one really big area that we've been really putting a lot of focus on is the plugins and creating a lot of helping businesses, basically building plugins, making it as easy as possible for developers to be able to create these different ideas that they have.
00:24:00.588 - 00:24:04.250, Speaker A: Can you give me an example of one of these plugins? Just to kind of give us some context.
00:24:05.550 - 00:24:33.746, Speaker B: Something really simple is like, I want to, for example, have a SMS verification for my users, or I want to add a KYC feature, which is really important for fiat exchanges. You definitely should have a Kyc AML sort of service. So you need to integrate this. You need a really nice user flow for doing that stuff. These are just some simple examples, but.
00:24:33.768 - 00:24:49.718, Speaker A: I mean, it can go, here's an idea for me. I don't know if you have this, but dusting, like if you're doing trades and you've got like this tiny, tiny amount, some feature that kind of collects and dusts and does that and aggregates, oh man. I don't know if you guys have.
00:24:49.724 - 00:25:16.670, Speaker B: That, but that'd be a good one built in. We have minimum orders and that sort of stuff that the exchange operator can set. You don't want to, for example, trade below this number because that's a dust. But actually we have the exact feature you said people have dust in their wallet. How do I convert that? I want to put all of it together. It's been a very requested feature from a lot of businesses.
00:25:17.030 - 00:25:37.282, Speaker A: Crypto is so interesting, right? All this. Anyways, fantastic. You guys got a lot of great stuff on your roadmap. People came in, asked some good questions and I appreciate that. Ali, it's been awesome to meet you and chat a bit. I've got links to all your properties down below, so everyone, we know how to get a hold of holox. So please go follow them and join those communities.
00:25:37.282 - 00:25:39.190, Speaker A: Ali, it's been nice talking to you, man.
00:25:39.340 - 00:25:40.870, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks for having me.
00:25:40.940 - 00:25:42.618, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll talk to you another time.
00:25:42.784 - 00:25:43.530, Speaker B: Cheers.
00:25:44.270 - 00:26:00.542, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. That was cool. That was a great little insight. I don't talk to a lot of white label projects, and so to kind of reset my brain a little bit and think about those, really fantastic. Hey, I'm Andy from Chainlink Labs. Like, and subscribe if you want more videos like these. We do them a couple every week.
00:26:00.542 - 00:26:11.054, Speaker A: I got a pretty cool one tomorrow. It's an NFT project. It's at 09:00 a.m.. Eastern. It's with a guy called Maddok Mike. He made his own game. He came out of hackathons and is like a solo developer who's launched a ton of projects.
00:26:11.054 - 00:26:36.700, Speaker A: And so we're going to get another developer on to make sure the conversation is a bit technical. So if you have questions, if you're a developer, please join up. All right, we got a couple more questions. So, bhakti, do I hold or buy any nfTs? I got a couple nfTs. Yeah, man. You got to kind of understand the communities to be a part of this. I don't got any big ones, but I got some fun nfts that I like to hang on to.
00:26:36.700 - 00:26:56.130, Speaker A: Got an interesting question here from Robert Kirby. My goal by this decade end is to work for chain link Labs. It's just the beginning of the, I mean, that's eight years. You got a long time. Why don't you do that sooner? Chainlink Labs is hiring. Go to the careers page on chainlinklabs. I think it's com.
00:26:56.130 - 00:27:23.190, Speaker A: Let me see chainlinklabs.com. And then there's careers there. Chainlinklabs.com is like the organization that does the hiring for the official Chainlink labs. A lot of different organizations build Chainlink protocol, but Chainlink Labs is the organization that I work for. For example, there's a Chainlink discord. There's Chainlink telegram, those are the places to join.
00:27:23.190 - 00:27:54.094, Speaker A: The discord especially is where to find more developer resources and other folks for things like hackathons and building nodes and data feeds and all that sort of stuff bakhti so that should be down below as well. Chainlink discord is the place you want to go. That's for developers to really meet up and get to know folks. You can also follow at chainlink on twitter. That's kind of where the official announcements come out for product updates and major news. At smart underscore contract is where to find announcements for events like these and come do more. Q.
00:27:54.094 - 00:28:06.038, Speaker A: As like I said, we do a couple a week. I actually have three this week. I got a surprise one coming up on a Wednesday. I don't know when it is. I think it's going to be later in the day. But it's with a pretty big organization so I don't know. We're figuring that out.
00:28:06.038 - 00:28:23.482, Speaker A: And you can always follow me at andy Boyan on twitter if you want to. I post about non chain link stuff sometimes as well, but that's up to you. Hey everybody, I appreciate your questions very much. Come back tomorrow, 09:00 a.m. Eastern time. We're going to talk to maddok. Mike, here's a good question.
00:28:23.482 - 00:28:44.770, Speaker A: Okay, so before I sign off, Bhakti says, how decentralized is chain link? Chain link is really interesting. What I want you to do is I want you to go to data chain link. That's how to figure out how each oracle is decentralized. Each chainlink oracle is decentralized. And so you can go, and you can go to see like Btc USD. That's a price feed. And when you click in on that, it'll show you.
00:28:44.770 - 00:29:17.006, Speaker A: Here's the nodes. There's a bunch of them. There's two dozen nodes that are getting those prices and submitting them into an aggregator contract as a price feed. Each one of those nodes is getting data from multiple three, four, five more data sources that are themselves aggregating from hundreds of feeds. How decentralized is it? You go look data chain link, you can go find that out. Got a bunch of other products and solutions as well if you guys want to check out chain link for the main page and information there. Anyways, that's enough for me.
00:29:17.006 - 00:29:28.554, Speaker A: Thank you for coming to learn about Holox and a bit about chainlink. Bhakti, join those communities, man. I know you're interested. We're going to link pill you. Come on down the rabbit hole. You're welcome. All right, everybody, I'm Andy.
00:29:28.554 - 00:29:31.690, Speaker A: Thank you so much. I'm going to play my little outro here. We'll see you next time. Peace.
