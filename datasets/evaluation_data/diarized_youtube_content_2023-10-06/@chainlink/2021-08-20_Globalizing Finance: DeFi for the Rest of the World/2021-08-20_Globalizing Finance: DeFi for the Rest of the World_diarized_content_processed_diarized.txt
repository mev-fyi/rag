00:00:05.210 - 00:00:40.780, Speaker A: It's great to be back, as Andy said, globalizing finance, defi for the rest of the world is this panel. It's early here on the east coast, incredibly early on the west coast, but a much more reasonable hour in Europe and Asia, which speaks to the nature of our panel itself, where we're going to talk about how we're bringing people into the system, how this is truly global, and how it is more inclusive. So, everyone, I was hoping we could just go around very quickly. Just give us your name and your company, and if you would, the country that you're from. Hal, let's start with you.
00:00:42.990 - 00:00:52.110, Speaker B: Yeah, hi, everybody. It's my great pleasure to be here. I'm from SNZ and I'm managing SNZ pool. And personally, I'm based here in Shanghai, or China.
00:00:52.530 - 00:00:54.430, Speaker A: Shanghai. Victor.
00:00:55.090 - 00:01:05.506, Speaker C: Oh, guys, I'm Victor from Shaman. It's chinese city. Shaman. So see you.
00:01:05.688 - 00:01:07.410, Speaker A: Welcome, Diane.
00:01:08.150 - 00:01:26.470, Speaker D: Yeah. Hi, everyone, I'm Diane Dai, the co founder of. Yeah, you can call me Dai. Dai. And I personally based in Beijing, but my team members are just globally, in different countries, like Singapore, Canada, Australia.
00:01:27.850 - 00:01:29.430, Speaker A: Marvelous. Joyon.
00:01:30.010 - 00:01:38.118, Speaker E: Yeah. Hi, I'm do Hyun from Bifrost, and by five, I'm CEO and co founder. I'm based in Seoul, Korea. Nice to meet you.
00:01:38.204 - 00:02:01.300, Speaker A: Seoul, Korea. Excellent. So, everyone, maybe if we could just give a bit of an overview. One of the challenges with a panel like this, we have a short period of time and a lot of guests with a lot of information is to get the 50,000 foot overview of what you guys do. So if we could go around again in the same order, and you could very briefly tell us about your project and why you think it's significant. Hal, let's start with you once again.
00:02:02.390 - 00:02:03.140, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:02:05.270 - 00:02:48.980, Speaker B: Well, actually, SMZ, we have a couple of different activities of inns. Firstly, we've been in the investment activities for a couple of years in this blockchain industry, and then we've been working as a consultant as well for a lot of our partners. And then we have the mining pool as well, business, which I'm personally managing. And then with changing country, we've been working with the Changing as a strategic partner here in China for roughly two years. So it's my great pleasure to be here at the panel of changing summit for the second.
00:02:49.670 - 00:02:53.140, Speaker A: Thank you. Victor, tell us a little bit about your project.
00:02:55.370 - 00:03:50.374, Speaker C: Okay. Our project is VPD. I think most people know that VPD is open source, non custodial lending protocol, so users can deposit their money in our market and borrow others just paying some interest. So we have launched on Ethereum network since this year, January 18. And we now has been deployed on Ethereum oks, chain, bit finance, smart chain, polygon, and heckle. So around the TVL, around 80 to 100 million. We also enable our lending protocol, I'm sorry, liquidity mending program for a long time.
00:03:50.374 - 00:03:53.782, Speaker C: So you guys can also join in to have fun.
00:03:53.916 - 00:03:58.570, Speaker A: Okay, great. Diane, tell us a little bit about your project and why it's significant.
00:03:58.990 - 00:04:59.990, Speaker D: Sure. So, Dodo is a decentralized trading protocol built on Ethereum finance, marching polygon and soon on arbitrage, these different blockchains. And Dodo is ranked top ten and sometimes top five on each main chain by trading volume or by transactions or by trading address. Yeah. So on dodo, you can trade any crypto tokens at the best trading price. And if you are a liquidity creator, you can use various tools to create a token to create a liquidity pool and can start your own liquidity mining, give your own token rewards to your liquidity pools. I think DAX is one of the most important infrastructure in crypto space.
00:04:59.990 - 00:05:03.390, Speaker D: So I'm happy with a good career here.
00:05:03.540 - 00:05:05.150, Speaker A: Yeah. Joya.
00:05:05.970 - 00:05:49.446, Speaker E: Okay, well, actually, I have two to explain. Bifrost and Bifi. Briefly, Bifrost is a multi chain middleware platform that connects multiple protocols for dapps. And Bi Fi is the first DeFi solution based on Bifrost technology. Using the power of Bifrost multi chain technology, Bi Fi does not only connect Ethereum and BSc as it is right now, but also connects Polkadot, Clayton, and ultimately bitcoin without wrapping or bridging. So our goal is connect the entire fragmented DeFi ecosystem. And I hope that I can tell you more on this session.
00:05:49.638 - 00:06:33.500, Speaker A: Yeah, so one of the first questions that I have for people in this space, whether it's during a panel or whether I meet them socially, is, why did you guys get into this space? So, in other words, people who are doing things in the D five space have tremendously sophisticated backgrounds in technology, in finance, they have a tremendous number of other opportunities. There are a lot of other things everyone on this panel could have done professionally with their lives other than participate in DFI. What was it that drew you in? What was the powerful pull that got you guys working 40, 60, 8100 hours a week doing just this? And jump in, please. Anyone.
00:06:37.630 - 00:06:38.874, Speaker E: I can start first?
00:06:38.992 - 00:06:39.660, Speaker A: Please.
00:06:39.970 - 00:07:44.090, Speaker E: Yeah. All right. I have experience in the financial sector for ten years as a derivative trader and derivative fund. Well, actually, I got phd in financial engineering from the University of Michigan in the United States? Well, after working several years, like decades of years in financial sector, I realized that finance cannot really help people, really cannot help all the people in the world. As you know, we have more than thousands of years of financial history, but still, we have more than 20% of all the people who cannot use real financial services nowadays. And I realized that DeFi can really help this kind of problem to solve. And that's why I jump into the DeFi world, and I'm trying to make a real change for the financial industry.
00:07:44.250 - 00:08:08.070, Speaker A: Yeah, very happy for me. Very well said, and a great point. I believe right now, depending on the statistics you look at, they're between one and a half and 2 billion people in the world who are unbanked. That's a pretty staggering number. I'm curious what you guys think. Did anyone else get into this space for similar reasons, or do you have different reasons why you got into DFI? How about you, Diane? What are your thoughts?
00:08:08.510 - 00:08:54.040, Speaker D: Sure. Yeah, I think I have a different story. Compared to Dang Yun. I was born in 1997, so I think the youngest one in this panel, and for our generation, I really think crypto is the best job for our generation could ever get. Your time is pretty free. You can manage your own time, and most of the teams are just working remotely from home. And actually, you are joining a movement that kind of rebuilding the whole financial system.
00:08:54.040 - 00:10:14.494, Speaker D: So I think for people like me personally, before I graduated from college, I took an internship at a blockchain company, and that is decentralized exchange. So one of the first exchange I have ever used is not Robin Hood, and it's not Coinbase, not even finance. It's a decentralized exchange that running on blockchains. And that was in 2017. And by then, I'm just totally attracted by this kind of technology because it's totally free and equal to everyone, no matter where you work and no matter where you live. So I think it's kind of the freedom spirit attracts me to just totally interdisciplinary industry. So last year, when my last company kind of didn't do anything more about DeFi, but I and my ex colleagues just decided they still are very into DeFi, and they want to have the whole of our career here.
00:10:14.494 - 00:10:16.160, Speaker D: So we founded our own.
00:10:18.930 - 00:10:47.434, Speaker A: Know, Diane raises some very interesting and important points. First, this idea of generational shift. I think I was actually working in a bank in 1997, Diane, which is depressing to think about, but I'm curious when talking about another point that Diane brought up that I think is so important is the inclusivity and access to this. We all know that there are barriers. We mentioned the statistic before, 1.5 to 2 billion people in the world who are unbanked. I think it's 1.7
00:10:47.434 - 00:11:10.100, Speaker A: billion. If you look at the World bank statistics, these are huge numbers of people. And the promise, of course, of DFI is that we can have a system that's more inclusive, that brings more people in, and that empowers more individuals. I'm curious if that speaks to anyone else on the panel. Perhaps Victor. How do you guys think about how this system is empowering individuals around the world?
00:11:13.510 - 00:12:31.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I can share my idea about that DeFi. Actually, we think that it's going to be changed the world, the financial world, because with the current financial system, there are a lot of problems. I used to live in Europe, and I still remember how difficult that time for me to send my own money from Europe to China. It takes a lot of time and it costs a lot, and it's not transparent at all. And with the DeFi, and we are amazed by that, because it's building on the code, it's building on the technology, and it's just less. That's why we could have get rid of the middlemen and we could have the low cost service for ordinary people to get access to this new financial solution, new financial world. And besides, another thing which is quite interesting or amazing, that with Internet, we could have the information, global information work.
00:12:31.180 - 00:13:01.874, Speaker B: I mean that there's no board, there's no country for information to move from one place to another place. But it doesn't work for the assets, for our assets. But with DeFi, which is called the topic is global finance. It means that we are not only physically based in different places of the world, but we could move our assets from one place to whatever on the blockchain network. There is no physical bar for our asset. And it's part of the global finance.
00:13:01.922 - 00:13:04.440, Speaker F: And which is amazing for me as well.
00:13:04.970 - 00:13:21.280, Speaker A: Yeah. So, globalization and transparency, always very important issues in this space. Victor, what are your thoughts? Anything you'd like to add? I don't know if Victor can hear us. Go ahead, please.
00:13:21.810 - 00:14:53.818, Speaker C: Okay, so I just noticed, actually we should tell this story by our background. So before the DeFi, I invest a lot for the stock market or something. Also after that I worked with the CFI works and also some self software. But I think DeFi is just young thing. So we participate in DeFi last some defy summer. So we just know that not quite a long time, but by my opinion, it gave us totally transparent space to the finance before the market is controlled by a lot of companies. So we can protect our money, I think, from the shrinking of the currency depreciation or something.
00:14:53.818 - 00:14:59.242, Speaker C: So that is important for us. I think so, yeah.
00:14:59.296 - 00:15:50.960, Speaker A: I think a lot of people in, around the world and even here in the United States agree with that sentiment and find real resonance there. Since we've set up a little bit of the framework here, gotten a little bit of a sense of where everyone on this panel is coming from in terms of why you got into the space, why it was important to you. I'm curious if perhaps we could flip the lens around a little bit and talk a little bit about your views of the future. First, what does everyone here think are the most important ideas for bringing new people into this space? This panel is about inclusion, diversity, and globalization. In order to reach scale in this space, what do you guys think needs to happen in DeFi as this ecosystem continues to mature? Go ahead.
00:15:51.330 - 00:16:26.600, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll start very briefly. The most important thing I think is the defi system should be easy to use and easy to access. Right now, defi system, you know, there are only few people, comparing to all the population of the world, very few people use defi system because the wall is too high. It's really hard to use and hard to access. So if you put that on the subject, it should be very easy to use and easy to access. That's the first thing that we should be aware of, I think.
00:16:28.910 - 00:17:09.782, Speaker C: I would say, as a lending protocol, I would say you must show the new guys the higher Apy for stablecoins than banks, Alipay and Wechat or something else. Just like our slogan in pigeon, we get rich. Most of people get in this area, even me, from any money here. So after that, we'll start thinking about the future step by step. And I'm very fortunate. So I joined in this part, join defi. So I think get a lot of money here.
00:17:09.782 - 00:17:48.340, Speaker C: But to new users and normal users, it's same. We must give them profits. That is very important, no matter the western or eastern. Same. I think we have seen many new things here, like NFT or something recently. But there's the same reason users why they choose to join the NFT or anything, just because they can earn little money or something like that.
00:17:49.510 - 00:18:20.426, Speaker A: Well, I agree with Victor. East or west, everyone wants yield. And I also think Joyan makes an important point. My mother is not currently participating in the DeFi space. I feel like a lot of folks out there, parents are probably not participating in the DeFi space. As Diane pointed out, I think there is this intergenerational issue that we're thinking about right now. And for things to become truly broad based, truly accessible to the masses, those are problems that are going to need to be solved, challenges that are going to need to be worked out.
00:18:20.426 - 00:18:44.580, Speaker A: Diane, I'm curious. Your perspective on this is very much, as you say, being born in 1997 from a different generation. What do you see as the challenges that need to be solved? Or the flip side of the equation? Maybe spoken in a more positive way? What are the things people need to do to get a more global and inclusive vision of people in the DeFi space?
00:18:45.530 - 00:19:32.610, Speaker D: Sure. First of all, I agree with Victor. That way, the builders should make some features that could potentially help people to make some money. Right? Just like in the last DeFi summer. Before that, people just can hold token and do nothing. But now they can take their tokens and do the yield farming, right. Absorbing to some classmates, some of my classmates and friends, they are still in study or just enter a new work.
00:19:32.610 - 00:20:30.762, Speaker D: And I found that some of them enter defi because of two things. One thing is, like I said, they can buy some stable coin and they can your farming. And the second thing is about the animal tokens. So they just ape into a lot of animal tokens and imagine they can get real rates. I think the whole point is when you design a new product, you have to keep that in mind. Your mechanism should have some financial effect for people to easily to access and can potentially make money. So they will start to learn how to use different crypto wallets.
00:20:30.846 - 00:20:46.540, Speaker A: Yeah, great points. How. I know this is going to be hard for you because we've probably covered a great deal, but if you could maybe in just the next 30 seconds or so, because we've got to move on. We've got one final question, but any quick thoughts that you have about making the space more inclusive and pulling more people in?
00:20:47.310 - 00:21:38.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I tried to add on something different, actually. I totally agree with other points mentioned by other guests. And I think there's one thing which is kind of necessary or even mandatory for way to see Defi go to mass adoption is the regulation. And firstly, if we want to play the Defi game or your farming, we need to have the crypto assets. And without regulation, I think it's very difficult for ordinary people to get access to the crypto world. And once they have their crypto asset, and then they can think about DeFi or your farming. And if there is a regulated way for them to pay the Defi and then that's perfect.
00:21:38.570 - 00:21:43.722, Speaker B: And then that will be the moment when they imagine the mass adoption of Defi.
00:21:43.866 - 00:22:14.386, Speaker A: Yeah, great points. So we've only got about three minutes left here. I know it's shocking. We blew through this 25 minutes in this session incredibly quickly. It went by in the blink of an eye. But the final question I wanted to ask everyone is this is coming to us from the sponsors of this conference. Chainlink is interested to know what role Chainlink specifically plays in your underlying architecture and the importance of Chainlink products and services in your smart contracts or protocols.
00:22:14.386 - 00:22:23.420, Speaker A: Perhaps we could go in the order we reverse order. So maybe it would be Victor first, what role does Chainlink play in what you do?
00:22:24.190 - 00:23:22.234, Speaker C: Well, Chainlink, I can tell the long story in short. So firstly, for the Oracle networks and the price fees, you know, the lending protocol for the price fees is very important. Many lending protocols get problems, even compounds, they meet accidents. So just because they don't use chain link and now they start to learn for this and they will choose the chain link for the press with. That's very important for the safety of the learning protocol or other protocols. Also, because we have deployed on many trends, so maybe we will deploy on ten public trends and that trending can give us all of them. So that is very important.
00:23:22.234 - 00:23:25.758, Speaker C: And others like keepers, we will also.
00:23:25.844 - 00:23:38.850, Speaker A: Victor, unfortunately, we've got to move on because we've only got about 30 seconds for this question per guest. Yeah, I'm going to throw over to Diane really quick, if you could, in 30 seconds, what role does chain link play in your protocol or architecture?
00:23:39.190 - 00:23:39.554, Speaker C: Sure.
00:23:39.592 - 00:24:07.486, Speaker D: So the dodo exchange is built on PMM algorithm, proactive market making algorithm, and this algorithm is to gather liquidity around some price guide. And for the price guide, we use chaining Oracle for some of our liquidity pools. For the mainstream trading pairs like WBtC Ethernet, stable coins.
00:24:07.618 - 00:24:15.578, Speaker A: Right. So the oracle function, I apologize for the short time. We only have a few moments left. Julianne, really quickly, what role does Chainlink play in your protocol?
00:24:15.754 - 00:24:27.870, Speaker E: Yeah, of know Chainlink price Oracle is very reliable and most secure, I think. So we are very lucky to have Chainlink price Oracle, especially when there are numerous hacks on DeFi.
00:24:28.310 - 00:24:38.950, Speaker A: So that's it. A perfect and short answer. Finally, we're going to get this done on time. How to you? Final question, important significance of chainlink in your protocol?
00:24:40.410 - 00:25:14.538, Speaker F: Yeah, actually we don't have our own protocol projects, but actually we've been working with Chainlink from the first beginning of the mainnet launch as a node operator, and we've been working together with Chainlink to provide the infrastructure, a stable and secure price feeding infrastructure for all other protocols. And then looking forward to the channeling 2.0. And we're going to provide all the data feeding, not only the price feeding, but data feeding to all other protocols.
00:25:14.714 - 00:25:26.280, Speaker A: Another perfect short answer. Security and stability seems to be the common theme there. Thank you everyone on this panel. It's been a great conversation, and thank you to everyone watching at home.
00:25:28.970 - 00:25:40.340, Speaker G: Thank you to our panelists. It's great to hear from around the world different DeFi protocols and projects, the differences and many more of the similarities that we actually have together. So thank you all for being here.
