00:00:05.490 - 00:00:26.114, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Welcome, welcome. Sorry about the delay. I have problems in my connection. But let's start. I'm so excited with you and with amazing Hackton. And I'm here to teach the basics.
00:00:26.114 - 00:01:09.702, Speaker A: I know that you already know a bit about Chainlink, you already know about hard hat. Amazing tool for developers. But I love to take care of the beginners. So let's start with the first concepts like create a wallet, understand remix that is online environment to deploy and to create smart contracts. And is this starting about me? My name is Solenzi Garos. I am a developer advocate at chainming clubs. And you can see that I'm watching for this side or this side because I have two screens.
00:01:09.702 - 00:01:42.454, Speaker A: My camera is in the middle, but I am a few all time probably looking one of the screens. Let's share my screen. Before that I uninstall my wallet because I'd like to start with you from zero. This workshop is for beginners. Totally beginners. Let's see if it's okay. Yes, it's good.
00:01:42.454 - 00:02:31.380, Speaker A: So I share my screen now. Here we are. And why something is bad. Yes, because the string art is in the wrong place. Now it's good. Okay, so what do you do now? I will invite you to go with me to this file. Are you posting this chat as well? It and to be sure that you are here with me, let's add your name and country.
00:02:31.380 - 00:02:52.460, Speaker A: I'm from Brazil and you. Welcome. Come here. Let's learn together. Let's be together in our workshop. Yeah, the people are joining. Great.
00:02:52.460 - 00:03:17.314, Speaker A: Only an S. Wow. Where are you? Yes, I'd like to have more people with me. You'll be more fun. Welcome Adgar. Amazing. Oh, this is not here.
00:03:17.314 - 00:03:41.638, Speaker A: Yes, we are here. Let's see. Yes, you received the pet again if you need it. Hey, Edgar from Venezuela, from India. Okay, I don't know who is you. Great. We have some names.
00:03:41.638 - 00:04:18.754, Speaker A: Feel free to add your name later. So the people are adding the names, hearing the chat in YouTube chat. But I'm asking you to go to this collaborative pad. We can write together, we can delete everything together. So be careful. But the idea is that we are interacting with the pad. Like if you know how to copy and paste, you can do my workshop because I will copy and paste the smart context here in our pad, our collaborative pad.
00:04:18.754 - 00:04:58.558, Speaker A: And then you will be with me copying and paste in your own computer. And welcome all the people that are putting your name, your country in the YouTube chat. You can use the pets to be together with me. Welcome. Great. First thing that I do, I don't have a wallet, so I install a wallet with you. Probably if you already did the other sections, you have your wallet, but I know that the beginners don't.
00:04:58.558 - 00:05:22.330, Speaker A: So let's do it together. We used to use metamask. This is a nice wallet. So what I did. Now you can see here in our collaborative path, the metamask IO. So open this in your computer and I am on Chrome. I will download and install metamask for Chrome.
00:05:22.330 - 00:06:33.454, Speaker A: And welcome people from Uruguay, Germany, Morocco, Lushenburg, India, Japan, Turkey. Wow, Peru. So I'm installing my wallet now and talking about wallet and talking about the first concepts of web three. It's so important that when you have your wallet, you have some words that we call it the seed phrase, backup phrase, or minnemonici. And for metamask it is twelve words. And this is the most important part of your wallet. Be careful, you cannot lose these words because if you lose it, you cannot access your tokens or cryptocurrencies anymore.
00:06:33.454 - 00:06:55.450, Speaker A: So be careful with this. Another important point. Don't share these words with anyone. I will share with you. I know, but teaching you. So I need to share any wallet and agree. Okay, now I will add a password.
00:06:55.450 - 00:07:20.370, Speaker A: And again, this is not a bank. If you forgot your password, you can't recover. Be careful with this. You don't have a person to ask to reset your password or the wallet. The metamask don't have your password. It's yours. Be careful with this and create a new wallet.
00:07:20.370 - 00:08:02.800, Speaker A: Now is the important part that I told you related to secure my wallet. The secret recovery phrase. This is the twelve word phrase that we need to get now and again, don't share these words with anyone, but copy this for you. You need to have a copy of this and don't lose it anytime. Okay. For now, I will show my words for you because I'm teaching you. And here you are.
00:08:02.800 - 00:08:32.102, Speaker A: Only I can do this. You cannot. And this is the words I copy and paste in another place. Yes, I have it in another screen. Another part. And here it was. Okay.
00:08:32.102 - 00:09:05.922, Speaker A: And I need to close some windows here, especially the WhatsApp. Now it's good. Okay, next, what will happen now? I need to paste or to write some words again. The third and fourth and eight. Here. Yes. And.
00:09:05.922 - 00:09:23.030, Speaker A: Okay, this is the most important part of my wallet and your wallet. Be careful. And yes, I have a wallet now. Done. Let's close this. And here we are. This is my wallet.
00:09:23.030 - 00:10:03.510, Speaker A: Next step. My wallet is on Ethereum mainnet but we are learning. So let's do it in a testnet. Let's go to Ethereum testnet. Here I enable the test networks and to you be with me, you must do this. And here show test networks and IU enable this and scroll up to close this part. Now I can select the sepolia test network.
00:10:03.510 - 00:10:30.254, Speaker A: Let's close this and this. And probably I need to refresh my pet and. Wow. Now I have a lot of people. Amazing. But someone I read, copy and paste that everything is in the same color now. So select Sepolia, one of the test networks from ETU and.
00:10:30.254 - 00:11:07.830, Speaker A: Okay, we are on sepolia. But I don't have iters yet. And I need iters to publish my smart content to interact with any smart content in the network. So how can I get this? Let's go to our faucet. In the chaining faucet you have the option to connect your wallet and get some tokens. Here we are. I'm connecting my wallet with metamask.
00:11:07.830 - 00:11:29.722, Speaker A: It means that this website, this app can interact with my wallet. In fact, for now it will only get the address. And here we are. This is my wallet. Iu request 20 link. The link I will not use in this session. Okay, but it'll be useful for you and 0.1
00:11:29.722 - 00:11:52.966, Speaker A: test it. This is the most difficult part for me to prove that I am a woman here. But because I'd like to have it, I need to log in via Twitter. If I only needed the link. Test the link. I don't need it. Okay, but for now we need this.
00:11:52.966 - 00:12:18.878, Speaker A: I will give you another option. If you don't have. Wait a minute. Faucet. If you don't have a tweak, for example, you can try this. Now this faucet is good as well. Welcome.
00:12:18.878 - 00:12:39.880, Speaker A: We have more people joining. Amazing. I do my logging via Twitter. So I am on the faucet. I connected my wallet. Now I'm doing a logging via Twitter and I need to check if I am a human. Let's see if I can do this.
00:12:39.880 - 00:13:09.582, Speaker A: Casino tokens. It seems that I got it. Yes. So I miss sending a request to the network. In a few minutes you have the transactions. So remember that we are in a blockchain networking the test network. And I have this hash that the faucet sent some it for me.
00:13:09.582 - 00:14:14.198, Speaker A: Here we are. The value and when this transaction now is in the main pool, it's a waiting area. When this transaction is in a block in the blockchain, you become firm it in the blockchain. So this is for the e and this is for the link. And here is the atriscal it's an application that has his own nodes and a database where all the information in the node is indexed. And then you can query this so fast and you can see that I already have the transactions confirm it and I can close this close this and if I go to my wallet probably your wallet is already here. Mine is not because I need to pin and you can see that I have 0.1
00:14:14.198 - 00:15:16.554, Speaker A: sepolia next step, where is my link? Because I'm sure that I got the link as well. I need to add the link token in the wallet. How can I do this? The best way go to the documentation of chainlink and get the address of the link token. And this is so important and this is to add link to metamask and it's so important to you to go to the right place. Don't only ask or search in the google because can appear another token with the name link that is not the real link token. So be careful and always go to the right website for any protocol when you need the token. When you need the token address and here I am.
00:15:16.554 - 00:16:01.960, Speaker A: I am in the documentation of the chain link the official site and I came into the link token content and I can see here the sepholia and here you are. Let's edit this for you. Oh I don't know why the pad is so heavy today. Come here Sephola testnet I will add to wallet so it will be added to my metamask wallet in an automatic way. Here we are. I already have it in tokens add tokens okay amazing. Welcome all the people that join later.
00:16:01.960 - 00:16:48.194, Speaker A: And here we are. 0.1 Sepola and twaint link then we have our wallet here. And remember that if you couldn't get the tokens directly with the sepolia, I will give you two options more like the alchemy has a faucet as well. So you can get the alchemy but here you need to do a login. Maybe you can do later but just another faucet. It's a kind of mining to get tokens.
00:16:48.194 - 00:17:29.970, Speaker A: So if you copy and paste your address prove again that you are human. But this is not so easy. I don't know if this is a letter or no. Let's try only this. Yes and it's a kind of mining. And this is. We are already installed metamask got tokens in the change to the testnet sepolia and got tokens now we are done.
00:17:29.970 - 00:18:09.162, Speaker A: We are ready to the next step that will be remix. So let's add this in the pad for you. This is remix. Okay, and what is remix? That remix. It's online environment to develop concrete. And when we start, probably you will start here and here with the file explorer and in the home. The first thing that we will do now is configure remix to us.
00:18:09.162 - 00:18:38.220, Speaker A: We need to do two points. First we go to the fourth icon. Let's see. 1234. This is the solid compiler and you will enable the auto compile option. Enable autocompile. Then we are going to the.
00:18:38.220 - 00:19:20.962, Speaker A: And you can see here that mine is already enabled. Enabled. Okay, next step we are going to not this but to the next icon. And this is the four five deploy and run transactions. And here I'm going to environment here. 558 icon environment in the beginning. And I need to change the environment to injected provider.
00:19:20.962 - 00:19:58.450, Speaker A: So I'm connecting this environment to develop context the remix with my wallet, which is metamask. So I need to approve your metamask that remix same transactions using metamask. Let's do this. What is happening with me now? Probably not with you because I uninstalled my metamask and I already have remix. Open it. I need to refresh. Wait a minute.
00:19:58.450 - 00:20:27.390, Speaker A: Here we are. And let's go again. Environment and injected provider. Yes, now it's working. I need to approve it using my wallet in my metamask. Wallet. Next connect is this.
00:20:27.390 - 00:21:28.574, Speaker A: You can see now that I am on Sepolia network. And if I open my wallet also you can see connected here the green sign. Everything is good now. Okay, let's edit this for you. Injected provider. It's time to go to the second icon. Here we are.
00:21:28.574 - 00:22:02.780, Speaker A: And where is the create a new file. I go down workspaces, default or wherever, it doesn't matter now. And here below I have a create new file. Okay, I created the register saw because I already have you one here. I created the register one saw, but it's the same for you. Next step. IU copy for you our code.
00:22:02.780 - 00:22:27.380, Speaker A: And with the slash this is a comment. Okay, are you copy and paste our code between the comments. Let's get our code. It will be this. And here we are. You can copy the code. Be careful to not cut.
00:22:27.380 - 00:23:03.038, Speaker A: Be nice with the other friends that are here. And yes, Edgar, this is the same class of the boot camp I used to do. This being the first class, the most didactic. Here we are. I copied and remember that this is mine and paste. And I know you can trust in my code. Now what I have here, let's understand our code.
00:23:03.038 - 00:23:39.706, Speaker A: First line, I have a comment with the license of my code. I'm using open source license mit after I have a comment called pragma that define the version of solidity. So I'm using the solidity version 0.8.918. This is the latest. Then I have the word, the comment contract. This is to define much content. So what I have here is defining my content.
00:23:39.706 - 00:24:35.498, Speaker A: I have the name register and inside the brackets are my content. In my content, I have a variable, it's like a box that you can put something inside and this variable is of the string type. I can add any number or character here, any word. And this is private. It's private, but not so much. It means that private, when a variable is private, I can access only inside my contract. But when I may sending some transaction to save information here, for example, here in the set info in this moment, you can see this transaction, it's public.
00:24:35.498 - 00:25:25.686, Speaker A: So you can see what is the information that it saved in the private variable. So because of this I can tell you that it's private, but not so much because you can monitor if you have a function like this that it's setting the information. Talking about that first here I have a function, it's the same concept. What is in the bracket inside the function colored setting for IUpass, a parameter that it's the information that I'd like to save in my variable. This is publicly, anyone can account this. And I'm saving the information because my variable is private. I have another function colored getinfo.
00:25:25.686 - 00:26:22.430, Speaker A: This is public as well. It's a view because I'm not changing nothing in the blockchain, I'm only querying information and it will return to us the string that save it in the variable info. Okay. In fact, if I put this being a public variable solidity, for example, you create for me this and it's possible to get the information, we call it gitter directly without need to create this function. But remember that I prefer to do this in a didactic way. I'd like to teach you how to create a view like this. So I decided to make my variable private.
00:26:22.430 - 00:27:02.052, Speaker A: And is this our first smart context is already explained. Let's deploy it. We need to go now again to the fifth button. Deploy endurance transactions and we are click on deploy. Here we are. I'm going to the deploy button. You can see here that the name of my file is register one.
00:27:02.052 - 00:27:41.724, Speaker A: The name of my content is registered. I only have this now, but I can have complicated or a concept that is importing other libraries other content and I can have a huge list here. So be careful and pay attention. If this is the name of your content, let's deploy it. Okay, here we are. Are you confirming my transaction? So remix is sending a transaction to Metamask. Are you confirming Metamask? Metamask.
00:27:41.724 - 00:28:33.680, Speaker A: You add this transaction to the network in his node and you'll be confirmed by the network confirming and you can scroll down and in the deployed context part. My contact will be here in a few minutes and iOS queue to put here your name and register address. Let's do it. Yes, I have mine. How can I copy it in the right side of my content? I can copy it and claim it here and add it. You can do this as well. I'd like to know if you are doing with me and I need at least one person to do this to help me in the class.
00:28:33.680 - 00:29:17.920, Speaker A: Okay, here we are. I will expand the register now and I have the get info. I click on get info and I have nothing because I didn't set any information in my content. So I use the settings to save something. Let's save it. Chainlink at info here we are. I'm sending another transaction by Metamask from Metamask confirming.
00:29:17.920 - 00:30:02.740, Speaker A: And when this transaction is confirmed, it's here. I can see in the right path bottom as well what's happened with my transactions. Now if I go to get info, I can see the chain link over there. Like I said before, I can monitor this transaction and because of this I can say that my variable is not so private. Let's understand this better. Here we are. This is the last transaction iu c on the explorer and if I go to more details, I call it the function set info.
00:30:02.740 - 00:31:18.900, Speaker A: Okay, I cannot see the information now, but I can try to decode the information. And here we can see that the parameter info that is a string received the information changing and okay, my variable is private but the transaction is public key. And you can see this here. If I change my information in Nikki hackathon this so now I'm saving another information. And this is another so interesting point to you before I show that I changed because we used to say that smart contexts are immutable and what this means, I cannot change the code, I cannot add a new function. Now if I need to add this, if I'd like to change something I need to deploy again. I'm creating a new smart context in the network to have a new address, so I can update the same.
00:31:18.900 - 00:32:00.510, Speaker A: But if I have a function inside my comfort like this, where I'm changing some information that is stored in my content, yes, this is possible. So I can change information inside the contract, but I cannot change the code. This is immotatable. Let's see now. Yes, I have the chain link, hackathon 2023 here. And if I check the second transaction. Not here, here, it's another fat info.
00:32:00.510 - 00:32:40.250, Speaker A: And if you show more, and the code here is the information. What I'd like to to tell with this, when I'm changing some information on blockchain, I can audit this. I can have the history of our transaction that's changing this information. So this is an important concept to you. And thank you, Edgar Rose Consti and for doing with me. I will use one contact of you in a few minutes. This is my transaction.
00:32:40.250 - 00:33:20.154, Speaker A: If you'd like to see mine. But here you don't need to put yours. What do you do now? Remember that we are in a network and we are around the world. Let's see, where is Edgar? Edgar is from Venezuela. Hola, Edgar. So how you interact with Edgar's contract, how you do this, you use the at address to interact with any conflict in the network. You need two things.
00:33:20.154 - 00:34:07.420, Speaker A: One, the address of this content. Two, the Abi of discontent. It means the functions, the definition of the function that you'd like to interact with. In our case, I already have the source code is the same source code. So if I use that source code with the Edgar address, I can interact with his content to interact. So I'm here, I have the code. I you go to Etsy address and paste the register of our friend.
00:34:07.420 - 00:34:57.770, Speaker A: And now you can see that I have two instances. The second is not mine is from Edgar. And yes, it's from Edgar. I'm sure this because he had his name in get info. Edgar, I'm sorry, but I change your information for chaining hackathon 2023. Let's go ahead and please, Edgar, please change it. Let me know when it's changed.
00:34:57.770 - 00:35:15.646, Speaker A: It's pending. Not changed yet. Remember, I send the transaction, but the transaction is not in a block yet. It's not confirmed. We are waiting a bit more now. Let's see. Yes, it's confirmed now.
00:35:15.646 - 00:35:54.446, Speaker A: So I'm checking the information inside the Edgar's contract. And now it's changing. Hackathon 2020 Z. Hey, Edgar, is it changes now? Let us know when you can. And this is what message I like to pass to you. Now, if we have complex and variables that don't have any access control. Anyone in the blockchain can change this, can use this.
00:35:54.446 - 00:36:30.130, Speaker A: And this was already used in a lot of hacks in the past. So be careful with this. And yes, Edgar told us that the smart content changed. And it changed to everyone because we were in the network. In the same way. If one of you would like to change my content, you can do it, feel free to do it. But talking about the access that I was talking before, in a few minutes we are creating another conflict with some access roles.
00:36:30.130 - 00:37:16.840, Speaker A: With a white list. Exactly. To understand this better. But before that, another useful concept to you is how to verify your smart context on at risk and why we are in a public environment and our code is open source. It's like to the people trust in your comfort. It's good to you to publish the source code of your comfort. How can you do this? And Edgar told me that change.
00:37:16.840 - 00:37:35.342, Speaker A: Let's go, Edgar. The first is mine. You remember? Oi, Edgar. He adds oi, Solange. Hello, Solange. So, so nice. And is this.
00:37:35.342 - 00:38:07.778, Speaker A: Come back here. Now I came to wrong place. I'd like to verify the source code of my content. To prove that the byte code that is. That is the same from my source code. How can I do this? First I will get my complex address copy. Then I came into the sepolia editorscan and I search for my contract.
00:38:07.778 - 00:38:41.460, Speaker A: It's here. And you can see that this is a contract. And we already have some transactions. It was created and then the settings sometimes. But let's go to Tabi contract and here we will verify and publish your contract. Okay? And you can see this. This is the byte code.
00:38:41.460 - 00:39:07.702, Speaker A: We cannot understand this, but the EVM, the Cheerio virtual machine can. So let's change this to the code. This is our goal now. Verify and publish. Here we are. I go to verify and publish. This is my concept, the compiler.
00:39:07.702 - 00:39:33.280, Speaker A: It's a single file and the version is the latest 0.8.918. Then the license is open. Cersei meat. So here we are. You need this information. Let's see if I can copy this for you. No, not.
00:39:33.280 - 00:39:52.994, Speaker A: No problem. Let's continue. Let it. And then I need to paste the code here. So you come back to remix. This is my code. Copy it, select it.
00:39:52.994 - 00:40:12.506, Speaker A: Control A to select it. Control C to copy and control V to paste here. And here we are. This is the code. I don't have any arguments in the constructor. We are talking about this in the next contract. And I'm not a robot.
00:40:12.506 - 00:40:40.102, Speaker A: I can verify and publish. And here we are. This is the content is verified. Now if I go back to my content. You can see here that now I have a green sign here. This is my content. And I can interact with my content here as well.
00:40:40.102 - 00:41:12.130, Speaker A: Not only on remix, I can read the get info. For example, I can write information if I connect the iter scan with my wallet like we did with remix. I am not this now. I not do this now. So is this. Let's create the next contact. Now that the other concept that I'd like to tell you related to access and ropes.
00:41:12.130 - 00:41:47.906, Speaker A: And we can use this exactly. Using some libraries. You talk about opening Zeppelin at the end, but let's do this in another way so you understand better. We are creating now a new concept that is not here. I need to get from another place. But create register access. This is the next conflict.
00:41:47.906 - 00:42:13.640, Speaker A: I need to create it. I don't have it. And why I can't create a new file it here. Okay. I need to get my content in another place. Wait a minute. That you find him.
00:42:13.640 - 00:43:11.720, Speaker A: Okay, let's see the last time that I did it. Okay, here we are. Access the concept. Are you first cop for me? Let's see if it's okay. Here we are. And then I can give you the COVID that you will copy what is between the begin and end. And someone just arrived in our workshop, so you need to go.
00:43:11.720 - 00:44:42.080, Speaker A: Sorry, I was muted. Yes, I hope that is not so long that I did this. Yes, it was me. Thank you for letting me know. So only to be sure that you are with me. I just shared the remixing the pad again. And then I ask you to create this second conflict called the hashtag access.
00:44:42.080 - 00:45:19.542, Speaker A: Copy and paste this code for you. And here we are. And I started to teach you no sound. Now I think you have sound. And I know that we have some delay in YouTube. So what I have here, I have the variable string that it's not only one information, we have a list of information. This is an array.
00:45:19.542 - 00:46:07.000, Speaker A: This is a new concept for you. And this is colored info as well. Let's see, where are you? And we have another kind of information. Khaled, please, someone can let me know if now you can hear me. We have a second kind of information of a second type of variable. Call it address that it's used only to store address. And this is.
00:46:07.000 - 00:46:37.700, Speaker A: I have this. This is a public variable. And this is the owner of the content. And I will tell you in a few minutes how I am using this. Here I have a new kind of variable as well. This is mapping. The mapping has, it's a value.
00:46:37.700 - 00:47:20.322, Speaker A: We can say that's a key value. For each key we can have one value. In our place we have the address. So for each address we will have a boolean type, it's true or false type. And our variable, this list, it's a white list. This is public and I will use this like only the people who are in the whitelist now will be able to change the information in this contract. Now this is a new concept for you as well.
00:47:20.322 - 00:48:17.902, Speaker A: This is the constructor. The constructor is used only to initialize the variables. It will be colored only when you are deploying the conflict, not anymore, only during the deploy in the call structure, I mean initializing the owner using the message sender. The message sender is like when you send a transaction, it's like a message for the blockchain. So message sender is the address who is sending this transaction. In the same way I have here the white list. Remember the white list where my address will be true.
00:48:17.902 - 00:49:14.840, Speaker A: It means that I am in the white list. Edward is asking to zoom in, but I think my code is big. Let's see if this is better now for you, Eduardo. Okay, after the constructor I have a new concept for you, a new solidity concept. This is the event. Events are not stored inside the blockchain, but they are sending with the transaction and you can have services to monitor the events. In our case, I have an event called info change and every time that I change the information iu emit this event and here I have the old information and the new information.
00:49:14.840 - 00:50:21.546, Speaker A: This is another concept that I'd like to tell you. The modifier modifier is like conditions that you can have in your smart content and you can attach the modifier in functions like I'm equating the modifier only owner. Then I have functions that can be executed with only owner because they use this modifier. Let's come back to the modifier what I have in the modifier, I have another concept for you. The requires. So I'm requiring that the person, the account who is sending the transactions, the transaction is the owner. If it is not, I will send the message only owner in the same way I have the modifier only whitelist where I require that the account who is sending the transaction is in the white list.
00:50:21.546 - 00:51:18.110, Speaker A: It means has the whitelist true? If it's not Iu sent the message only whitelist. Then our function get info is changed a bit because I have a list of information, array of information. The first index is zero. Remember this and I need to pass the index to get the information here I'm getting the information of one box, one index in my list. Okay, the setting for now is used to change some information. To update the information, I need to pass which index I'd like to change in the list. And then what is the new information then first I'm emitting that event that I created before.
00:51:18.110 - 00:51:55.898, Speaker A: Remember the event here. First I will emit this. So emit info, change with the old information, the information that is now over there and the new information. And then I'm updating the information. Next step, I have the one point I cannot forget this. Who can set information now? Only who is in the white list. In the same way, I have the adding food to add the new information in the array in the list.
00:51:55.898 - 00:52:37.110, Speaker A: In the same only white list. And the info push, it's adding the information the end of the array and I'm returning the index of the information. If the user would like to know. After this, I have a function called list info that will return out the array of information. Be careful because if you try to use this kind of function with array so big, it will not fit in the blockchain. Like you cannot return the values anymore. Be careful with this.
00:52:37.110 - 00:53:13.570, Speaker A: Like if the list is so big, you need to create range. In our case, it's good to use only this way. And I have two administrative functions to manage the members. Only owner can add a member or delete a member. What means add a member? Are you add some address in the whitelist saying that it's true. You can use if you are in the whitelist or I use say that it's false. The default is false.
00:53:13.570 - 00:54:00.174, Speaker A: So is this. This is our contact. Our contact. Let's deploy it and understand it. So I'm going to deploy and run transactions again. Register, access, deploy and confirm. And please add your name and register access address like I do mine.
00:54:00.174 - 00:54:20.750, Speaker A: I will be so happy if we have more people doing with me. Deploy. Let's see. I think I have in mind now. Yes, here we are. This is the address. You demonstrate first and then you try to interact with other comrade.
00:54:20.750 - 00:54:58.944, Speaker A: Here is that info. Are you added the chain link over there? Here we are. Let's see when I have the chain link here, I think yes. Are you going to list info? Not yet, probably I saw now is I have this. If you'd like to see this index. This is the index zero. It's over there.
00:54:58.944 - 00:55:13.240, Speaker A: Index one doesn't exist. I can. Got an ahold here. Okay. Ah. So let's add more information. Hackathon.
00:55:13.240 - 00:55:48.834, Speaker A: And now I'd like to show you that another account cannot change or add information here. Let's wait this second. Yes, it's confirmed. If I go here. Chain link hackathon. Try the get info index 10 one. And I have the hackathon here.
00:55:48.834 - 00:56:14.970, Speaker A: Amazing. Let's see if I can include this pack as well. Chain link hackathon. Okay, perfect. Now remember that I'd like to show you that another account cannot interact with my conflict. I will create another account on Metamask and you can learn how to create another account. I have this.
00:56:14.970 - 00:56:47.000, Speaker A: My account. You go to the colored circle and create account. Now you have your second account. Here we are. And remember that I don't have ethers in this account. So I need to do two points. I was mining, but this is going to my first account in a few minutes.
00:56:47.000 - 00:57:23.970, Speaker A: What do you do first? Are you not waiting this? But I. You go here to metamask again. Come back to the first account, come back to the second, copy the address of the second account, go to the first account and send some iters to the second. No, I'm so rich now. It's perfect. So what do you do now? Hey, so happy that we have a lot of conflicts and Etikada. I will interact with you in a few minutes.
00:57:23.970 - 00:57:54.442, Speaker A: Okay? Wait for me. So what do you do now? Are you send like 0.1? Not here. This is the address. You send 0.1 to my second account in order to do this test with you. And I'm waiting here after this.
00:57:54.442 - 00:58:13.170, Speaker A: I will try in the second account. Anyway. I try with Edgar Edigar. This is your comfort. Let's help me again. Thank you. What do you do? I create another instance here using the Edigar comfort.
00:58:13.170 - 00:58:35.658, Speaker A: And I try to add some information. Let's see. Yes, I am in account one. You added a saw over there. I can do this. I cannot do this because I'm not in the right list. And this is good.
00:58:35.658 - 00:59:18.630, Speaker A: You can see now that we can control who is sending transaction or modifying the information. Our contract. So Edgar, could you please add my address? I will copy my address for you here. And in the same way I will do this in my second account. Account two. I will connect remix with the second account. It's connected.
00:59:18.630 - 00:59:48.240, Speaker A: So in the same way, my second account can't interact with my content. I create in the first account, not in the second. If I try here to add the solve, I can't and I receive a message here directly. I'm not authorized by the user. Maybe when I change over there. I didn't change here. Let's see.
00:59:48.240 - 01:00:12.920, Speaker A: 50, 81. Yes, maybe I can do nothing. Let's see if I authorize this user. Because I like to receive the message like I received before. And I don't like to refresh my remix. Now this is my account. Let's come back to my first account.
01:00:12.920 - 01:00:50.180, Speaker A: How can I approve someone to interact with my account? I go to add member and I wish that someone add my address to be a member. And shink. I don't know if I may pronounce your name right. Sorry, I'm trying. Shinkahad, I will do with you as well. Okay. First I'm adding my second account.
01:00:50.180 - 01:01:30.820, Speaker A: Then I add Shinkahar. Yes, this is mine. This is from Shinkahar. And Shinkahar, you can try to add some information in my concrete. Feel free to do this. Probably you can do it in the same way Edgar told me that I can interact with his concrete. Now let's do it.
01:01:30.820 - 01:02:01.580, Speaker A: Let's see what Edgar has in his contract. Edgar from Venezuela. Okay, so from Brazil. No, I'm not in the whitelist, Edgar. I can't yet. Let's see if my address is in the whitelist before. Remember that this is my address.
01:02:01.580 - 01:02:20.770, Speaker A: I'd like to see if I am in the whitelist. Here we are. No, I'm not in the whitelist, Edgar. You need to add my content. Let's see who is the blue that add. Me. Yes, it's you, Edgar.
01:02:20.770 - 01:02:55.094, Speaker A: Maybe I use your contact wrong. Is this yours? E 60. E 60. It just happened another day with me that I try to interact with another comfort in the network. Sometimes I get. Sometimes. No, I'm not sure if it's a problem with the connection with metamask, with remix, but it's a bit strange.
01:02:55.094 - 01:03:26.470, Speaker A: Now what can I do? I have another idea because I'd like to try this. I don't know, Adega, if you did the iterisca part. Probably not. I can do it for you because we don't have any restrictions with this. So I verify the editor's concept. Let's see if I can do this the same way. It's a single file.
01:03:26.470 - 01:04:01.060, Speaker A: It's latest version. It's Mh. Continue. And you go here and I try to interact, not using remix. Because this is not the first time that I can't do this. If Inadigar's content has one line more or less than mine, it's a problem. But not amazing.
01:04:01.060 - 01:04:30.186, Speaker A: So this is agar content. I'd like to try to write in his content here. So I connect my wallet with iteriscan as well. Yes, it's a beta function. So amazing. Metamask connecting and let's try here add info first. Let's see if my address is here.
01:04:30.186 - 01:04:58.100, Speaker A: Let's get my address. My address whitelist. Is my address in the whitelist? No, Edgar. Even here I'm not in the white list. So I can't interact with your comfort. So you need to add G's address in your white. Let's see what's happening in my bed.
01:04:58.100 - 01:05:26.990, Speaker A: You need to add my address that is here in your account. Shinkahar. Could you interact with mine? Or someone else could try to add G's address in your content. Shum interactive fuel content. Shinkahar. Okay, so I try your content. Your content is not here.
01:05:26.990 - 01:05:48.260, Speaker A: Is this? Yes. Let's try it. Iocrate a new instance. Deter this from Shinkahat. Here we are. Let's see if I am in the whitelist first. This is my account.
01:05:48.260 - 01:06:10.122, Speaker A: This is the whitelist. Yes, I am in the whitelist. Let's see what he has here. But you don't have any information or list. Shinkahash. Wow. Are you at changing Kyongi? Yes.
01:06:10.122 - 01:06:37.280, Speaker A: And I can. I'm so happy. So you can see that now I am interacting with this concrete from Shinkahar. Not my concrete. Because he allowed me to do this and end. I add you an information over there. Now, Shinkahar, you must add another information.
