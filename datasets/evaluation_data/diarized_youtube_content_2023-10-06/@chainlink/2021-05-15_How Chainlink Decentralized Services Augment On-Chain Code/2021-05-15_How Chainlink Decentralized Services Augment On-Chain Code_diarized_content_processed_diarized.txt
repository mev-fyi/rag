00:00:01.370 - 00:01:22.534, Speaker A: I think the fascinating thing about this meta layer and the compiler that would turn whatever form this definition of a hybrid smart contract had, I think the fascinating thing is that it would actually really orchestrate the use of a blockchain. So I think it's very important to keep in mind that the blockchains and the L2s and all of these system will have a very critical place as the places where the primary kind of smart contract code will continue to live. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to accelerate the amount of contracts and the advanced usefulness of those contracts, right. So I think at the end of the day this meta layer and the ability for people to have all these services and to configure them around a primary piece of core on chain code more and more efficiently is really a win win situation for everybody. It makes the developers much more productive and able to achieve their goals. It enables more smart contracts with more useful functionality to make their way onto various blockchains and L2s. And it also creates a virtuous cycle, more demand for decentralized services because more people are building these smart contracts because they can build them.
00:01:22.534 - 00:01:33.940, Speaker A: And so I think it's this kind of change in our industry that I'm very excited about and I think we're all looking forward to as a result of this body of work. Thank.
