00:00:08.330 - 00:00:22.480, Speaker A: Hi, everyone, and welcome back to another Chainlink q A. Today we're here with Panche from Chromatica Finance. He's one of the lead developers and the founders, and we're really excited to have him here to share more about what Chromatica Finance is building. So, Panche, how's it going?
00:00:22.850 - 00:00:32.102, Speaker B: Yes, hello, everyone. Welcome. Fine. The weather is getting better. We're going towards summer things, so yeah, everything's great here.
00:00:32.156 - 00:00:34.258, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Staying positive.
00:00:34.434 - 00:00:43.530, Speaker B: Yes. Glad to be here to the listeners and to the viewers to actually present about the Chromatica and what we are actually doing here.
00:00:43.680 - 00:01:00.894, Speaker A: Perfect. Well, we're really excited. I'm Zaji. I have Harris here as well from Chainlink Labs, and we'll go ahead and dive into something. So, learning a little bit more about Chromatica finance, how is it that you are considered the next generation of Dex crypto trading? We'd love to learn some more about that.
00:01:01.092 - 00:02:11.720, Speaker B: Exactly. Well, to actually start about why Chromatica is the next generation Dex, we need to start a bit like there are a lot of dexes out there and we need to start and answer the question, why Chromatica? Well, first, all the dexes more or less provide the very basic features, which is kind of swap and potentially limit orders. And Chromatica, Dex provides both. I'm going to start with the very important feature, which is the limit order feature, because usually limit order feature is not available on the taxes. You can really find the limit orders on any centralized exchange, but when it comes to the centralized exchange, it's pretty tricky to implement. And this is actually the first feature or the major feature which Chromatica tries to implement, which is the limit orders. And for the viewers that do not know about it has actually started on a Chainlink hackathon event last fall.
00:02:11.720 - 00:02:51.650, Speaker B: So this whole project actually was, we applied in September or October on the Chainlink hackathon event with this exactly feature, which is implementing limit orders on a decentralized exchange. And we joined it and we were like one of the Rice winners announced. And this is how it all came up since then, since I think December when it was announced, we started building it and adding more features around Chromatica.
00:02:54.940 - 00:03:39.400, Speaker C: That's awesome, man. It's also great to see hackathon projects come to life as well. And it's great to see that the combination of all of the people coming together is now building great products for all of these users to use. I think in looking into you guys before this conversation, noticed a lot of interesting features in terms of how you guys are differentiating yourselves in terms of being that next generation Dex noticed specifically enabling no swap fees, particularly, I know as a user of Dexs and maybe some people who are viewing this now, there are some fees, small fees in terms of how these swaps go. But from your perspective, how does that work? From your perspective, how do you guys enable no swap fees?
00:03:40.060 - 00:04:46.856, Speaker B: Well, the point is that we are enabling no swap fees by replacing a swap with being a liquidity provider. So I'm going to go back to kind of a very basic concept, especially about the limit orders and about the swaps. So we have two features in chromatic swaps and limit orders. I'm going to talk about the limit orders features because this is what does not have any swap fees, does not have any slippage, and it's not sustainable to front running bottom attack, usually how limit orders are implemented on decentralized exchanges? Well, there are two ways how limit orders are implemented. You just specify when you want to buy or sell a certain token at a given price, and then they're kind of bots or whatever monitoring that price. And whenever that price is reached, someone does the swap. So it's actually a market swap at the time when a price is reached.
00:04:46.856 - 00:05:39.070, Speaker B: So it's actually a swap underneath and then you're paying swap fees and there is all those slippage stuff and so on. What Chromatica does is something different. Instead of placing a limit order and executing as a swap, we are placing a limit order in an order book like way. So that means whenever and by being that we are placing that limit order as a liquidity provider. So underneath, when user place limit order on Chromatica, they're actually a liquidity provider around the target price. So I'm going to say a very simple example. I want to sell one ether for any stable coin, let's say at the price of $3,000.
00:05:39.070 - 00:06:38.908, Speaker B: So what usually on other exchanges or other dexes, when you place limit order, you just place a limit order at that price. And then there are some monitors, some bots that actually monitors when the Ethereum reaches 3000 and when the price is reached, the bots execute the swap on your behalf and they are just sending you the money. But that means there will be a slippage, there will be a swap fees base and so on. Chromatica does very differently. You want to sell one ethereum for 3000, but instead of us executing a swap, we are actually adding a liquidity at the $3,000 mark. So whenever the price increases, you are actually a liquidity provider at the $3,000 mark. So when someone is buying your ethereum, they are paying you the swap fees.
00:06:38.908 - 00:07:01.400, Speaker B: So you're actually getting the swap fees from the other, essentially earning what we are calling a liquidity provider fees. So just with Chromatica, not just you're not paying any swap fees, you are getting fees, or you're getting swap fees from the others, which are essentially what are called liquidity provider fees.
00:07:02.780 - 00:07:13.260, Speaker A: That's super interesting. So yes, it sounds like you figured out a way to use the community to help each other, essentially to work within Chromatica, which is really interesting.
00:07:13.410 - 00:07:57.240, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Like most of the community are interested in swaps and limit orders, swaps are pretty basic. However, limit order are not so more of an advanced feature here. And usually when there are a lot of funds to be bought or sold, people are actually placing a limit order so that they don't bother of the time whenever a certain price has been hit and so on. And chromatica scales well with the amount that you're placing. So the bigger amount, the more fees you're earning from your limit trade. So essentially what we are calling is you place limit order on Chromatica and you're earning a yield.
00:07:59.180 - 00:08:36.070, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, you've hit on the limit order piece a couple of times. And I think from a swapping mechanism perspective, it's a really important piece of infrastructure for defi. Right. Because in a traditional financial perspective, of course, you could place like stop loss orders, limit orders, things like this, so that things execute to your example when certain prices are met. So I'm just curious, from your perspective as a lead developer on this team, what is some underpinning infrastructure that enables it? I've heard some chain link keepers use cases. In this case, how has keepers in this instance, enabled some of these functionalities to take place?
00:08:36.860 - 00:09:42.750, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So essentially, I'm going to, the point is when placing a limit order on chromatica, you're a liquidity provider, essentially. So you're earning liquidity provider fees. And that's what's different with the other dexes, because on the other dexes, you pay a swap fee, your subtails to slippage and so on, even when you place inventory. But then the point is that that liquidity needs to be removed at certain point, so that when the price surpasses $3,000 for this case, someone need to remove that liquidity, basically, and send it to the user. So the smart contract cannot automate themselves, does not have a scheduling mechanism. So we are relying on external scheduling mechanism to trigger this removal of the liquidity when the price is above the mark.
00:09:42.750 - 00:10:22.410, Speaker B: And this is where the chain keepers is helping us or enable this, because from our perspective, we have built a set of smart contracts, set of features, but we are relying on the decentralized bot network that chain keepers provides to execute our smart contracts at a given time. What that means is that essentially we remove the liquidity and send the money to the users at a certain point of time automatically. Right.
00:10:23.580 - 00:10:35.068, Speaker C: So it's like automating that process, right, where things that you would probably have to do manually before it just streamlines, it makes it more intuitive to the user without having to think about it.
00:10:35.154 - 00:11:17.960, Speaker B: Yes, from a user perspective, everything is automated, so they just place the order. Then we are kind of there waiting for the price to get hit. And then once the prices get hit, the chain link keepers start to kicking in and they are actually sending the money to the users and basically removing that liquidity which was sold and sending it to the users. So the users, from user perspective, they just place limit order and they get their money. That's it. They don't bother what is behind it. It's us and chain linkers that integrate it and enables that.
00:11:17.960 - 00:11:21.660, Speaker B: So that from user perspective it's seamless integration.
00:11:22.800 - 00:11:42.640, Speaker A: Very nice. Yeah, thanks for explaining all that in detail. It's really good to hear how keepers ties into all of that. So thank you. And I know that with this integration you were expanding onto new blockchains and when you look on your website you're building on a few different blockchains. So do you want to talk about how being crosschain is important for Chromatica finance?
00:11:43.160 - 00:13:33.412, Speaker B: Yes, well, we have started initially on the layer one. Everyone is kind of familiar with that and so on, and we have started there and this is where the proof of concept was built and this is where we got deployed and integrated first with the chain in keepers. So I would like to thank the Keeper team because we were very much closely working for a few weeks and integration and creating some question answers and calls. And we have successfully integrated the change in keepers back in January and since then there were a constant back and forth and some communication with the team. We have been founding some issues here and there and discussing with the Keeper team. And after some time we have figured out that the fees or the gas fees on the main net were too high for our users and even for the keepers, because keepers are automated bot network that needs some gas fees or in this case some link tokens so that they can automatically execute our smart contract function and send the money to the users. And from their point on, we were very glad to find out that the keepers were available also on Polygon, which was very kind of interesting for us because polygon gas fees are very cheap and it will require us to a lot less link and a lot less fees in order to run it.
00:13:33.412 - 00:14:18.420, Speaker B: And that's how we ended up deploying our DAP. And we have integrated the chain link keepers as well on Polygon, which was kind of very interesting things. And now we have integration with the keepers on two networks. And to add on top of that, we are also deployed on two other chains, which are arbitrary and optimism, and we are very eager and looking forward whenever Chainlink decides to deploy keepers there. And for us, the sooner the better because that will ease off the burden for us having to manage an automated bot network ourselves on those two networks.
00:14:20.200 - 00:14:48.270, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely, man, so really cool to see, obviously moving from the genesis of the hackathon and now moving across to what you're saying now, four different chains. Curious how you're managing a community across all of these different networks. Was the idea to go cross chain generated by the community or how do you guys determine what you're kind of doing next? How do you manage the relationship with the community?
00:14:49.460 - 00:15:54.816, Speaker B: Well, as I mentioned, we have started the chain hackathon and all this proof of concept was started on the main net, but from very start we wanted to cover as many layer two chains as possible because at that time of the launch, the main net gas fees were pretty huge. So we need to find a different solution. And that's why we went to even from the start we said, well, it's not just going to the main net that we're going to be deployed. We're going to go to as many layer two chains as possible from the beginning. So usually the projects, what are kind of doing, they're focusing on one chain and developing the product on one chain only. We are trying to think differently and say, well, we're going to go cross chain from start and we're going to deploy on as many chain as possible. And right now we're on four chains and Chromatica has been there since November.
00:15:54.816 - 00:16:18.730, Speaker B: So already in six months, we are on four chains already. And we are now having kind of good thing and a bad thing. Good thing is we are huge and on four chains, but the bad thing now we kind of need to manage four chains and add features there and so on. But it's actually a good problem to have.
00:16:19.740 - 00:16:41.090, Speaker A: Yeah, it could be worse, right? And to see the success, I feel like we keep saying this, but of a hackathon project, getting this far is really impressive. So congrats on all of the work that you've been doing and the success thus far. And just to close things out, why don't you share what's on your roadmap? Is there anything coming up for Chromatica finance that the community should be aware of?
00:16:42.120 - 00:17:38.160, Speaker B: Yes, of course, the roadmap. The interesting thing is that when we started this on November, there was just roadmap for two months. We said we're going to deploy it on the main net and on one of the layer two chains and that's it. But after this kind of success, you're kind of pushing yourself to start expanding the roadmap and start adding more feature, more chains and so on. And now basically in January we came up with the roadmap for the whole year till q three of the year. And right now we are in our q two roadmap and we have, as I mentioned, already deployed the DaP on Polygon, but we are now stopping here. So we are now on four chains.
00:17:38.160 - 00:18:45.480, Speaker B: And as I said now it will be the interesting thing of keep adding more features to the Dap on all four chains at once. And those features are some features that are pretty interesting, which are the gasless feature, for example, like usually whenever you interact with the Ethereum network, with the blockchain, you need some ethereum, right? Well, we are kind of a little bit tried to modify that so that instead of paying with the gas with Ethereum, you are paying it with a different token, which is a chrome token, which is the protocol token that the Chromatica uses, which that fuels the protocol. So that means you don't need Ethereum anymore to swap and to limit rate on Chromatica. So this is our next big feature that is coming up nice. And I can just now say that it will come to Polygon first because it has the cheapest fees.
00:18:45.900 - 00:19:16.020, Speaker A: That makes sense, yeah, and that's huge news. I'm sure the community is going to be really excited to test that out. So thank you for sharing that and continue to update us on what you're building. We're really excited to be working with Chromatica finance on all of this, and I really appreciate you breaking down some of these defi terms and integrations for everyone here today. So Ponche Harris, thank you so much for being here. We'll definitely share some links to Chromatica finance in the comments below. And if you have any questions for the team, share them, and we'll make sure to get back to you all.
00:19:16.020 - 00:19:17.830, Speaker A: So thank you for being here today.
00:19:18.280 - 00:19:21.170, Speaker B: Thanks, Patrick. Yep. Thanks. Thanks, everyone.
