00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.560, Speaker A: On today's episode with we piggy of Chainlink Live. Welcome to Chainlink Live. It is D five, powered by Chainlink. My name is Andy Boyen. I work for Chainlink Labs, and I'm here talking today with Victor from Wepiggy. Victor, tell us a little bit about wepiggy. What do you guys do? What makes you special?
00:00:25.370 - 00:01:01.150, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. That's my pleasure. VPK is an open source known custodial crypto asset lending market protocol. In VPK's market, users can deposit their crypto assets to earn interest or borrow other crypto assets by paying interest. So compared to other lending protocol, VP gifts has many characteristics. Here I'm going to share with you three of them. First of all, safety is our first priority.
00:01:01.150 - 00:02:01.294, Speaker B: The safety is not only for technical issues, of course. All our smart contracts have been and will be audited by professional security companies before going line, but also for many other conditions like assess, evaluation, front end attack, oracle attack, user metrics and rest from regulators. To help users to deal with all the trouble, we launched an enhanced security solution. We call it Arc operation. Yes, obverse is the name from Noah's Arc from Bible. Secondly, we have paid great attention to governance since the first day we went online. We have designed our scientific governance framework.
00:02:01.294 - 00:02:46.334, Speaker B: Sit down. The values of the community, governance process, governance integration notes, and the corresponding basic principles. In the early stage of VPG. Yes, we learned a lot from the Michael Dow. They do a lot of things, and actually, we like the style. We want a scientific type, so we just don't need everyone write a lot of words in foreign, but not too much useful message. So we should do something like McDowell.
00:02:46.334 - 00:03:42.690, Speaker B: So by laying a good foundation, the follow up governance work can be justified and has a soul. That is our thinking about the governance. Thirdly, VPG is a protocol dedicated to multi chain lending and provide users with a full range of service. From Ethereum, VPC has successfully launched on OEC, BSc, Polygon, Heko, Arbitron, optimism, and Moon river. Totally eight networks in this year. I think that's three of our protocol. I think that's just some simple introduction.
00:03:44.070 - 00:04:23.070, Speaker A: So when I first started to learn about Webiggy, I went to the front page and it has all these blockchains listed, and you can flip between them with your metamask. And that's really impressive because we talk about multichain. There's a lot of challenges in making sure your protocol works for each different blockchain. It's the same for wallets, right? If you go to adapt and they have support for ten wallets that dev team has worked so hard for. That wallet support is very hard. It's just expanding your product to be available for more people in one way. So it's important for many projects.
00:04:23.070 - 00:04:39.474, Speaker A: I do see your comments in here folks as well, David. Yeah, I got some marines in here watching to get up and this ain't a zoom. I want to tell you, we are live right now. I see your comments. More people have come in. Welcome everybody. I'm talking to Victor from we Piggy.
00:04:39.474 - 00:05:02.814, Speaker A: My name is Andy from Chainlink Labs, baby. I see your question as well. It's a good security question. We'll get to that one later as well. But first, on this idea of cross chain and multi chain, this has been a topic I've been very interested in lately. Eight blockchains or L2s. That's a tremendous amount.
00:05:02.814 - 00:05:11.390, Speaker A: Why this strategy? There's multiple different strategies when a product launches. And why multi chain? Why is that important to Wepiggy?
00:05:12.310 - 00:06:12.180, Speaker B: Well, the multichain deployment plan is our co strategy. During the process we can get traffic pose from the different communities, gain greater influence, user base and capital scale and increase vp gives reputation and brand value. Actually someone may say the general lending protocol based on compound modes itself does not have many technical barriers. Yes, if they don't change any, they don't change even one line of compounds code. Maybe they are right, but it can now last long. As more and more logics will be added, the barrier becomes much higher. Like us, we have eight and we are going to do a lot of things like posture, everything.
00:06:12.180 - 00:07:02.338, Speaker B: Also compounds just gave you a smart contrast. There's a lot of front end work and a lot of risk control works to do and liquidators and a lot of things. The important thing is the brand and the community are difficult to replicate. That is why we need more users. We need to reach more users. That is very important for this part. In other words, brand value and trust will make running a lending protocol more and more difficult.
00:07:02.338 - 00:07:39.022, Speaker B: Even VPK is a project guided by long term mission. If we miss the good timing, the loss is incalculable. Therefore we must expand to so many networks repeatedly at this stage. Eight for now and five more in the schedule. Actually, we already have a plan for five more. That is for the multichain deployment. What we are doing, fortunately for now we at least did not miss it.
00:07:39.022 - 00:08:17.020, Speaker B: We don't miss the timing. And here we would thank all our users for their campaign company during this year which has allowed us to build up our brand and to prove ourselves with time. So it's also important for the time you will have experience and users, they know us. We've been running for over one year. No accident, I think. Little good. Okay, so I think that is what I mean.
00:08:17.630 - 00:09:02.154, Speaker A: The users, they're here. People are very interested in this. Airdrop people have been participating for a long time as well, so it looks like that is in the works and we probably won't get into the details. We may save that for your telegram, chats and info, but clearly that's on the roadmap for you in being across so many blockchains, trying to get different users. Have you noticed? Are the users different across different blockchains? I use different blockchains for different reasons, but I'm on multiple chains. But I've also heard that some people, they'll get on one. They're newer to crypto in general or Defi, and so they'll stay on one and only be on there for small amounts or things like that.
00:09:02.154 - 00:09:07.900, Speaker A: So are you noticing differences across users and how you need to develop the product for them?
00:09:08.430 - 00:10:04.154, Speaker B: Yeah, some users they are same and some of them, not some user only care about making money. So they will use the old chains. They get news fast then fast, don't need much help and guide. But some users get message from the influencers and media. Therefore the public chains influence in different region determine where its users come from. For the public chain themselves, of course they want to hope to serve as many global users as possible, but based on their influence. The reality is there are often more users in some regions and few of almost no users in other regions.
00:10:04.154 - 00:11:15.540, Speaker B: So regarding the user experience, the technique part, I think I can share something with you also true L2 network like optimism and arbitrage are still being optimized, but at present the cost is still high compared with the public chain which are using said chain solutions. This will seriously affect the user acquisition, but of the technique metro, the true L2 network will be more popular with the majority of users in the future. I think the side chain solution are transitional at this moment. Although they are slightly less secure and decentralized. Their user experience is quite good in the early stage and they can serve their existing users quickly. Like BSDA, Heckle and OEC. They can serve their users immediately, they just quick.
00:11:15.540 - 00:11:51.834, Speaker B: But there's also a concern with the sidestream solution when the user's value and the transaction value become larger will make it hard to effort. May the same problem of ethereum from my personal experience, BSC is now becoming more expensive and contrasted. But I don't think that is a big trouble. It just proved they are now on the right way and they will start to deal with this and push the development of the whole crypto industry. So I think that is my opinion.
00:11:51.962 - 00:12:26.426, Speaker A: There are some core, I mean, limits with the EVM, the computing interface on top of the blockchains, that is slow, it has some bottlenecks in it, and there are some solutions to that. And faster consensus helps and bigger blocks helps them. But there are some fundamental limits as well. But then of course, if you're a new blockchain or newer blockchain, a side chain, if you don't do EVM, there's a whole different challenge, right, where you don't get developers. And so there's this balance right now. And I agree. I think we're still working towards solving that.
00:12:26.426 - 00:13:00.866, Speaker A: But at the same time, there's different places for different users. So that's really interesting to see. And I think places like Wepiggy, especially because you're on so many blockchains, is a really interesting place to learn about where users are adopting, what they care about, from what regions as well. Like you mentioned, I think that there's a lot of really valuable information in your community. Wepiggy has integrated chainlink. We had an announcement a little while ago that you use Chainlink price feeds. Can you talk a little bit about how do you use Chainlink in Wi piggy?
00:13:01.058 - 00:14:19.738, Speaker B: Okay. I think it's simple. Integrating the most security and reliable defi infrastructure to optimize the operation of VPG lending protocol has always been an important goal for us. One of the critical pieces of VPK's success is a good price oracles. So by integrating Chainlink, the industry leading decentralized Oracle network, VPG has access to high quality, temper proof price fees which are needed to price crypto assets in our lending market. When the proto is issuing loans and checking collateralization, this will provide our user with strong assurance that their collateral assets will consistently track global markets and won't be affected by price manipulation. Technique ensures that VPG always insure loans at an accurate market price and keep the protocol over collateralized.
00:14:19.738 - 00:14:21.920, Speaker B: So that is important.
00:14:22.450 - 00:15:11.114, Speaker A: Some users will come up or people will come up to me when I see them at events and ask about what makes Chainlink different. And there's a number of differences, but one of the main ones is when you get a price into adapt, it's not just a market price, it is an aggregate market price. So there are actually hundreds of prices that are aggregated via dozens of nodes to come to one price that is then submitted on chain and that adapt. We piggy in this case calls to get their pricing for lending rates, for collateralization rates, for all the things that kind of underpin that Defi system. Yeah, JC knows he's in the comments. You don't use chain link oracles, you're going to have a bad time. So this actually addresses Babe's comment a little earlier.
00:15:11.114 - 00:15:53.870, Speaker A: There's many different hacks and exploits that can happen in DeFi, but a flash loan attack and some of these price oracle exploits. Chainlink is really strong against these and you don't want to change the prices, you don't want somebody to manipulate your prices. That's one of the worst things that could happen in there. It looks like wepiggy integrates Chainlink and goes live on a blockchain. Wherever Chainlink oracles are live, pretty much anywhere Chainlink price feeds are available, wepiggy seems to go does this impact your plans when you consider adding another chain? When you're looking to other chains, how do you think about integrating another chain and how does Chainlink play into a role?
00:15:54.210 - 00:17:06.610, Speaker B: Okay, so yes, for all our listed assets, as long as Chainlink provides price feed service, we will choose to use Chainlink's price feed first. So the impact is huge for us on adding a new chain or adding new assets. VPK regards Chainlink as the primary oracle network provider because of the mutual trust between Chainlink and VPK. Actually we regularly share the development progress of each other's projects so that we can match trending's pace as much as possible. And we find that we are very much in line with chain link's pace because we both have high standard of trend selection, clear sop and strict risk control. The priority of cooperation partners are similar. So unless when we want to lenture a certain trend or certain assets and the training cannot provide service in the short term.
00:17:06.610 - 00:18:12.300, Speaker B: So we will consider to use other third party price feed service, but usually not. Finally, what I must say is even we trust Trendlink, but for the safety of users funds to avoid any value. VPG's price fee system also includes a pre warning system. It will give feedback on abnormal situation to the risk control team so that we can make timely judgments based on change in the market environment to minimize the loss of users assets in extreme environment. Actually that is what we are doing. As you said, there's a lot of hackers in DeFi, you know, many people, I mean many projects, they don't choose Chenlik, even compounds get some problem before they use Chenlik. So we trust Chenlik a lot.
00:18:12.300 - 00:18:42.690, Speaker B: But we also have our own solution. Actually, we have a lot of technical results before. We have done cx and desk before. So we have a lot of experience. We know how to aggregator works and how to make the price much strong. Cannot be manipulated.
00:18:44.630 - 00:19:12.000, Speaker A: Even if it's not manipulated. This is crypto and sometimes the prices are just volatile and you still want to alert your users, hey, prices are going down fast. Be careful. You are in danger of liquidation, right? Because you want to give people a good experience. And liquidations are a part of Defi, that's part of collateralization and risk. But you do want to give people as much informed consent, right? Knowledge about that as possible. That's just part of transparency there.
00:19:12.000 - 00:19:43.506, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, I just want to give you a reminder. My name is Andy Boyne from Chainlink Labs. I'm talking to Victor from large, very large defi protocol that's integrated chainlink across eight different blockchains. Ethereum and Heco and BSc, and a whole bunch more optimism. Arbitrum L2s as talking. We've been talking a lot about multi chain and cross chain strategy. Victor, I wanted to pick your brain.
00:19:43.506 - 00:20:14.958, Speaker A: I wanted to get your thoughts on this. Some projects find they get really deep connection with a community on a single chain. But others, like you, like we piggy, seem to find success across many different chains. If you're a new Dap, how do you think your strategy would differ? If you're going to come out and you want to go multi chain eventually, but should you start on one or should you start on three? Or what are your thoughts there around for new projects when they launch? For developers?
00:20:15.134 - 00:21:34.380, Speaker B: Yeah. So I believe that every project team should start from the BP stage, I mean, the business plan stage, to think about its own positioning, what kind of users needs they want to meet, what kind of users needs they want to meet based on this, choose which chain to start from and then how to scale their users, how to achieve growth in the future and where. So on the other hand, a project team should understand their team's advantages. Market resource, I mean, marketing resource. Maybe a technical team may not have a lot. They should ask for the VC or some media for marketing resource and the market sentiment, and plan their own roadmap. This will enable them to leverage their strengths, make good use of the funds that the market can provide, response to the market's voice, and finally strengthen their team and achieve success.
00:21:34.380 - 00:22:45.090, Speaker B: In VPK's case, we are lending protocol and there are already some projects in the market before us which are focusing on the Ethereum ecosystem, like compound, karim, everything. So obviously we have to work hard on people that they cannot reach or they don't want to reach. So multichain development plan is clearly viable option for us. So at that moment, one years before, zero months before, we know that we will start this plan. Of course, the most important reason for us to choose a multichain development plan is the rising gas cost of Ethereum will inevitably cause more and more new public chain and new network solution to come out. In this way. There will be a large number of users that can now be served by the Ethereum mainnet.
00:22:45.090 - 00:23:04.710, Speaker B: That's our judgment. So we regard the multi chain deployment plan as one of our core strategy, which is surround the cities from countryside, in Defi field, you know, there is a policy from Mao.
00:23:06.090 - 00:23:26.030, Speaker A: I don't know that policy, but it makes sense, right? You've got a city. Ethereum may be like the largest, and now around there, the sort of suburbs are growing, maybe BSc and Polygon, some of the larger ones and then rural. But you're seeding users, you're seeding liquidity and providing products further out that help those cities grow.
00:23:26.180 - 00:24:16.910, Speaker B: Yeah. And the key point is how to use our tokenomics to guide the users. Finally go back to Ethereum. That is key point. That is our strategy part, and we will do something and users will see in the future. Through this strategy, the project can reach more users and expand our brand influence. When VPG becomes a key infrastructure for a large number of high quality public chain L2 networks, we will also realize the transformation from the lending protocol to the lending network.
00:24:16.910 - 00:24:40.966, Speaker B: The influence of our brand and the scale of our community will be our mouth and help us achieve our goals. So that's something I can share with the new beast and just VPG as an example, so I think you can understand.
00:24:41.068 - 00:25:20.254, Speaker A: Okay, that's fascinating. I think it's really fascinating. And we're in a really interesting time right now when it comes to multi chain, where we're still, as an industry, figuring out what do users care about, how many can we support? We're in almost a dozen now. Is it dozens? Is it hundreds, maybe? Is it thousands? Is it two? And we have to go back and forth. We don't know yet. As an industry, experimenting with that and figuring that out is very interesting to me. I have a question before we're going to wrap up soon because we're getting near time, but the name we piggy.
00:25:20.254 - 00:25:23.780, Speaker A: Is this about a piggy bank. Is that the idea?
00:25:24.390 - 00:25:43.158, Speaker B: Yeah, actually we piggy. Firstly, we think we are piggy bank or our piggy bank. Because you know, in the world everywhere we know the piggy bank. What is piggy bank? Very easy to understand. We are bank.
00:25:43.254 - 00:25:50.742, Speaker A: That was my question. Does that translate? Is it the same? Does everybody use a pig for a piggy bank? Or have that mindset?
00:25:50.886 - 00:25:54.058, Speaker B: Yeah, you just put that cone in the piggy bank.
00:25:54.154 - 00:26:06.370, Speaker A: That's global. And you guys are clearly a global chain, global community, global blockchains. Fascinating. I think I might still have a piggy bank. We might have broken it a little while ago.
00:26:06.440 - 00:26:07.106, Speaker B: We'll see.
00:26:07.208 - 00:26:24.870, Speaker A: Anyways, as we wrap up here, let us know what's coming up for wepiggy on the roadmap. Maybe in the next quarter or so or maybe even longer. What do you guys have plans? It seems like you're very ambitious and so I'm very curious what you're planning, Victor.
00:26:25.290 - 00:27:05.230, Speaker B: Actually VPX Romat can be roughly divided into four stage. The first stage is general bank. Actually we have complete almost like 80% of the first stage. And the second stage is cross chain branch. So we are doing now and we focusing on this stage. And the third stage is private bank. We will provide a lot of tools to users similar like yield aggregator, like something else.
00:27:05.400 - 00:27:06.662, Speaker A: Like a managed fund.
00:27:06.716 - 00:27:54.274, Speaker B: Yeah. The fourth stage is investment bank. Maybe I can little introduce just give you a sample like Conleys or this is CS tap, centralized tap and maybe some others like cake. They have if or something. They have a decentralized tab. So we will do something CDFI or DeFi. We don't have a clear plan, but we will do after we move to maybe next year, next two years we will start to consider how to achieve this.
00:27:54.274 - 00:29:21.550, Speaker B: At present we focus on the cross chain. As I said, after the VPG cone WPC is open for clam, the code development team will continue to focus on the expansion and iteration of the lending protocol and strengthen the business. We plan to start building and incubating more lending protocol, which technology starts such as rust. And we are also do something research and my colleague almost write a lot, maybe half or 70% of the new style and enter Solana, polka dot and ethereum 2.0. And also the anti volume ability of the protocol is something we have been hoping to improve. So we will promote VPG to move forward a serverless and web3 based protocol and bring in the form of Dow to deal with various extreme situation. You use Dow to discuss a lot of things and deal with a lot of things.
00:29:21.550 - 00:29:55.098, Speaker B: This includes a number of improvements such as decentralized domain name storage, oracles APIs, notifications, and full onchain governance. After the cross chain infrastructure has merged, VPG will evolve from a multi chain deployed lending protocol to a cross chain interoperable lending network. As I said, lending network, not just lending protocol. It's our plan.
00:29:55.264 - 00:30:41.458, Speaker A: I'm really excited to learn about that and I think once we learn more about how these networks are going to interoperate where those bridges lie, Chainlink is working on a bridge protocol solution as well with CCIP. Then we'll see more of these lending networks. And so Victor, when we get to that phase, let's touch base again and maybe I can have you back on, maybe have you on a panel and we'll learn how you guys plan to collateralize cross chain. I think there's some really interesting stuff there, especially across all these different networks, maybe global regions as well. But it's been amazing having you on and learning a lot more about Wepiggy. Thank you for the questions from the community and for showing up. Share this one because this is early in the states and so if you're in the States, you're a marine.
00:30:41.458 - 00:30:56.480, Speaker A: Share this around as well. We'll give it a retweet a little bit later this morning and make sure that people have a chance to see it. Victor, where does your community mostly hang out? Like where can people find you if they want to join? Are you mostly telegram or website or what's the best place?
00:30:56.930 - 00:31:25.046, Speaker B: Of course you can visit our website, vpiggy.com. As a bolton of our website we have discord and WeChat and Twitter and telegram everything. So you can just visit our website, wepiggy.com.
00:31:25.228 - 00:31:40.554, Speaker A: Okay, that is down below in the description links to a couple other things as well. But you can find Wepiggy down there and please go check those out. Victor, it has been awesome to meet you and awesome to get to know you. Thank you for coming on. I'll talk to you again another time.
00:31:40.752 - 00:31:42.220, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
00:31:43.710 - 00:32:05.746, Speaker A: Hey everybody, I want to talk to you for just a minute. Thank you, Victor, again, that was really great learning about wepiggy and thank you to the community for being here. My name is Andy from Chainlink Labs and we do these a couple a week. I was going to have two this week, but we had to drop one due to rescheduling. So this week we only have one. But you can check out my back catalog, man, we get a bunch of these amas with cool defi projects.
00:32:05.778 - 00:32:05.974, Speaker B: Cool.
00:32:06.012 - 00:32:42.062, Speaker A: NFT projects, all sorts of stuff. Next week we have a really big NFT project that is a very popular musical community. I don't know if they're launched, announced with us yet, so I can't say who it is yet, but they will probably announce today and then we'll do an AMA with them coming up soon. So I'm pretty excited for that one. And we're going to do a bunch more panels and things like that as well. We've got a whole bunch of stuff going on. So because of all that stuff like and subscribe like this video so other people can see it and subscribe so that you get notifications when these things come up.
00:32:42.062 - 00:33:05.814, Speaker A: If you want to follow a Twitter account that lets you know about when these are smart, underscore contract. That's kind of the Chainlink Labs brand. We do announcements on these events, all sorts of other events. So be sure to follow that. You can follow at Chainlink, of course, for official updates on product and other sorts of ecosystem, big ecosystem developments. And then. Hey, JC, I see you.
00:33:05.814 - 00:33:25.626, Speaker A: Thank you. You can follow me. I'm at Andy Boyan on Twitter and I tweet about these sometimes. And I tweet about chainlink because I'm a chainlink fanboy like many of you. Fanboy and Chainlink Labs employee, but still fanboy nonetheless. So feel free to follow me if you want the occasional dad joke in your feed. Thank you for coming.
00:33:25.626 - 00:33:40.754, Speaker A: Thank you for your questions. Share this with your friends. I'm going to get to the right thing that I got to get to here my animation so I can do an outro properly. Oh, okay. One more thing, one more thing. Since I have a few of you here later today. 04:00 p.m.
00:33:40.754 - 00:34:11.774, Speaker A: Every day this week, we are doing a holiday coding, crypto coding. End of year wrap up. It's me and my boy, Patrick Collins from Patrick Alpha C, who's a Devrel extraordinaire. And we're going to get guest developers coming on as well. And we're going to chat about coding. We're going to have a little bit eggnog, and we're going to maybe even sing a Christmas carol. Who knows? If we do that, we're just going to do a year end wrap up of Chainlink developments and web, three developments on all this sort of stuff.
00:34:11.774 - 00:34:25.450, Speaker A: So come check that out. That's 04:00 p.m. On this YouTube channel every day this week. The five days of chain link Christmas. Maybe we'll call it, who knows anyways, we'll talk to you guys later. Thank you. This has been chain link, powered by chain link series.
