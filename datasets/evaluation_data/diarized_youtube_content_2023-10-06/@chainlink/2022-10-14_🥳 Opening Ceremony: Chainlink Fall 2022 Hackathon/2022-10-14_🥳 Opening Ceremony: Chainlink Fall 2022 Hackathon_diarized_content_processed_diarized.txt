00:00:00.410 - 00:00:25.638, Speaker A: Hello, hello and welcome to the fall 2022 chain link hackathon. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, wherever you're tuning in from. Welcome, welcome to the stream. Welcome to the Hackathon. I hope you have your giant, you know, half gallon water bottles. Hope you got your coffee. I hope you've got whatever beverage that you want to watch the stream here.
00:00:25.638 - 00:00:45.834, Speaker A: And welcome to the hackathon opening ceremony. We have a lot to go over today, so I want to see some GMs in the chat. I know that we're not all, it's not morning where everybody is, but let's see some GMs in the chat. Welcome. Where's everybody from? Hello from Nepal. Welcome. It's 08:30 p.m.
00:00:45.834 - 00:01:06.130, Speaker A: It's North America GM. Some people are writing Gn in the chat, which is fine, too. Welcome. Oh, look at all these GMs coming in. Welcome, everybody to the hackathon. Oh, I love hackathons. Hackathons are near and dear to my heart because it is at a hackathon where I learned how to code solidity myself.
00:01:06.130 - 00:01:17.238, Speaker A: It's these events that build web3 up. Welcome. New York. Welcome. Nigeria, 02:00 a.m. In Australia. Welcome, welcome.
00:01:17.238 - 00:01:42.062, Speaker A: Nigeria, Sydney, Thailand, India, oh, my goodness. London, Harlem, NYC, Caribbean. Welcome, welcome, everybody. Welcome to the stream. Welcome to the hackathon. If you're not in the discord, if you haven't registered, you can still go to hack. Chain link register right now, jump into the chain link discord and be a part of this.
00:01:42.062 - 00:02:00.594, Speaker A: So let's just jump into the presentation. What are we talking about here today? Let's jump in. That's such a cool transition there. All right. Chain link fall 2022 hackathon. What's going on this year? How are we doing? What's going on? What are we doing for this hackathon? So here's the agenda. Here's what we're talking about today.
00:02:00.594 - 00:02:30.982, Speaker A: So little welcome. We're going to talk about some of the past hackathons, this hackathon rules, schedule and eligibility. And then, of course, we're going to talk about the prizes. What are we building? What are we doing here? And of course, we want to give a major thank you to Melody and her team, Melissa and Agnes as well, for being the ones to organize and put on this hackathon. They are the brains behind this. And I asked Melody to make a quick video for you all. So let's turn over to Melody.
00:02:31.046 - 00:03:05.458, Speaker B: Hi, everybody. I'm Melody, head of developer marketing here at Chainlink Labs. I just want to say that I am super excited to have you with us. This is our biggest hackathon yet. We have so many people registering across the globe and I know I can never match Patrick's energy, but I just want to say that we have prepared some great technical content for you and some really fun team formation events. So I just hope that you enjoy this journey and then build some really cool stuff. We are super excited to have you with us and good luck.
00:03:05.554 - 00:03:20.730, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Awesome. Thank you so much, melody, for those words and let's keep going. Yes, I'm loving all the comments rolling in. Very exciting. So thank you so much, melody and her team, for putting this on. It's all the work that they do that makes this come to life.
00:03:20.730 - 00:04:03.980, Speaker A: I'm just really here to host and help you all build really cool stuff. So let's talk about chain link hackathons over the past three years. Wow. I've been doing this stuff for quite some time now. Over the past three years, chain link Hackathons have had over 40,000 developers sign up, have paid out over $1.5 million, and there's been hundreds of developers who have been recruited, who've built million dollar protocols, who've leveled up their skills, who've met, networked, et cetera. There are so many developers who've gone on to do amazing things and then, well, actually, I should have just put 40,000 developers have leveled their skills up because everyone who's comes to these hackathons learns something new and levels up.
00:04:03.980 - 00:04:31.282, Speaker A: But yes, there have been many, many people who have been recruited, who've built their own protocols from these hackathons with these being the stomping grounds. So if that's what you're looking for, you are in the right place. If you've watched any of my videos about learning how to become a web3 developer, you know that this is the next step. This is the step applying yourself, getting out there, taking what you've learned and putting it to the test. You are in the right spot. You are welcome here. Welcome to Web three.
00:04:31.282 - 00:04:45.720, Speaker A: Even if you've just started coding web3, even if you've just started with blockchain, you're welcome here. Do not feel imposter syndrome. I know. We all do. Even I do sometimes. Don't let it stop you. Push past it and just go.
00:04:45.720 - 00:05:18.686, Speaker A: Anyways. Yes, there's been a lot of alumni success from these hackathons. We have DBridge, who's now processed $75 million in volume on their exchange. We had vulcan exchange bring on Mark Cuban as a strategic advisor, we've had $7 million raises, $3.9 million raises, $5 million raises. Tons and tons of protocols have come out of these chain link hackathons and gone on to be successful. We've also hired a lot of people from these chain link hackathons, and I know a lot of other companies are sitting watching, looking for the developers here to hire to bring onto the protocol.
00:05:18.686 - 00:06:06.786, Speaker A: So there's so many success stories that come out of these hackathons, which is why I'm always so excited to do these, because these really are the stomach grounds for innovation. These really are places where you can network, you can level up, and you can have all these successes. Not only that, but we have industry leading workshops. We have some of the most talented, most intelligent, best smart contract engineers and presenters give a lot of these workshops and can help you along the way in your journey building some really cool stuff. And we'll talk a little bit about this more when we get to the schedule. Countless others have used this hackathon to kickstart their web3 careers, be it their own protocol, getting hired. I'm kind of in the way, sorry, but one thing that I always encourage people to do is to make the commitment right now.
00:06:06.786 - 00:06:26.034, Speaker A: Make the commitment. I'm going to switch, I'm going to go just to me, ready? Make the commitment right now. Say, I am a developer. Put it in chat. Actually, put it in chat. I am a developer or graphic designer or a project manager or whatever you are. I'm an X and I'm going to submit a project to the chain link hackathon.
00:06:26.034 - 00:07:01.330, Speaker A: Make that commitment. Why? Because just you making that commitment and forcing yourself to submit something is going to give you that push, give you that deadline to finish something. Being able, being able to ship code, practicing shipping code is almost more important than having a creative spark or having. I've got the million dollar idea, whatever. Being able to execute is probably the most important skill, more important than having that creative idea. So make the commitment there, no matter what, you're going to submit something good. We're on the same page.
00:07:01.330 - 00:07:31.754, Speaker A: I see a lot of people posting in chat, so we're all on the same page. Excellent. Moving on. So far at this hackathon, there are 6000 developers signed up, over $300,000 in prizes, and 70% of the people signed up here are new to blockchain engineering. So if you're a little nervous that you might be not good enough, you might be not ready, I'm telling you right now, you are you're in the right spot. Okay. And the 30% who have some familiarity have some engineering experience.
00:07:31.754 - 00:07:49.182, Speaker A: I know you're going to do amazing things as well, and even if you don't, you just use this as a learning opportunity. Fantastic. These hackathons are for whatever you want them to be. Excellent. So here is a quick view of some of the prizes. Just the chainly prizes. This is actually not including the sponsor prizes.
00:07:49.182 - 00:08:11.338, Speaker A: We have grand prize, defi prize, social impact, NFT and gaming. If you've been to any of these other hackathons before, you know what's going on. And welcome back, of course. So here's a quick look. We're going to talk about those more in a little bit, if you haven't already. And I know I'm kind of like in the way. Be sure to go to hack chain link and hit that button, that add to calendar button.
00:08:11.338 - 00:08:36.398, Speaker A: Add these workshops where you can interact with presenters, interact with people who know what they're talking about, know what they're doing, ask a lot of questions. It's that superpower that makes these in person, these live workshops, so powerful. So be sure to go to those. There's a fantastic schedule. You can definitely check it out. Like I said, hack chain link. We have introduction to a lot of the tooling, building, external adapters, front ends.
00:08:36.398 - 00:08:55.270, Speaker A: Build a raffle code along Solana NFTs. Just be sure to check out the schedule. Okay? It's fantastic. Oh, and a random clue. Wonder what this could be for. I don't know. Random clue.
00:08:55.270 - 00:09:10.842, Speaker A: It's not like I ever do, like any weird games or scavenger hunts. No, that's not something I do well. I guess I'm just going to blow by this unrelated slide. All right, submit your project no matter what. There's so many prizes. This is how you'll learn. This is how you connect.
00:09:10.842 - 00:09:25.780, Speaker A: It's a resume builder. Get noticed, et cetera. Sorry, my quality keeps dropping. My wifi is a little spotty today. Or, excuse me, my Internet is a little spottier today. So apologies, the quality kind of keeps dropping a little bit. But submit your projects no matter what.
00:09:25.780 - 00:09:52.170, Speaker A: Like I said, make the commitment here. Okay, now let's talk about why we're here. Why are we building? What are we doing here? And I think it's important to talk about why we're here because sometimes we lose focus. We don't really know what we're building. We don't know what we're doing. Right. If you haven't checked out some of the content that we've created about why Web three is so important.
00:09:52.170 - 00:10:23.902, Speaker A: Be sure to check that out. Okay. We're building these trust minimized agreements to build a completely new landscape for us to interact with each other. One of the biggest places to interact with each other is in DeFi. We finally have the chance to build financial systems and financial applications. Where there's transparency, there's accountability, there's way less information asymmetry, and it gives everybody a better chance to participate in these markets. Whereas nowadays, a lot of the information and technologies are gated.
00:10:23.902 - 00:10:49.514, Speaker A: Right. You have to be a $20 billion hedge fund to have access to financial tools that we all should have access to. Now we finally have the ability. So DFI is absolutely massive for building these trust minimize agreements. We're here because of NFts. NFts are really cool, right? These are these new way to interact with art, interact with artists, to build communities. NFTs are another massive, massive proponent of what we're doing.
00:10:49.514 - 00:11:13.182, Speaker A: We're here because of DAos. We're here because of governance, because we have a more transparent way and a more accountable way to live society. Right? And to have these structures. We're here because of gaming. Gaming is getting more and more popular. And I probably should have put this on here, too, but I forgot to. We're also here because of social profiles and social networks.
00:11:13.182 - 00:11:40.874, Speaker A: If you haven't been checking out lens protocol, you should definitely check out lens protocol. It is the latest hotness, if you will. And we should give a huge shout out to all the amazing speakers and sponsors who are at this hackathon. But I just want to reiterate, the reason that we're here is because we are builders. We are building solutions to problems. And that's what we want to focus on here today. Build or this month.
00:11:40.874 - 00:12:11.430, Speaker A: We are building solutions to problems. We are finding problems that blockchain solves, and we are building really cool things around it. Now, another huge thank you to the sponsors for this hackathon. We have quicknode, Filecoin, IPFs, Polygon, Trueflation, and the Solana foundation. And we will talk about some of their prizes in just a little bit. So huge thank you to the sponsors for being a part of this hackathon as well. It is the sponsors, it is the speakers, and it is also you who make this hackathon possible.
00:12:11.430 - 00:12:34.014, Speaker A: So thank you, everybody who's here. Thank you everybody who's networking, who's being a part of this, who's taking the plunge going into web3. Thank you to everybody that makes these hackathon possible. I can't stress it enough how big of an impact these hackathons can make and how near and dear to my heart they are. So thank you for being here. We're really excited that you're here. Thank you to the sponsors, thank you to everybody who put this together.
00:12:34.014 - 00:13:14.934, Speaker A: Huge thank you. Now, with that all being said, with all these thank yous, with a little bit of understanding of what we're building, what we're doing, let's jump in. Although I said let's jump in like three times, let's talk about some rules and eligibility here. So everybody who is wanting to check out how they can submit, if they can submit, definitely be sure to check out the dev post and the main site that is hack chain link. Please see the overall rules for participation. This is an incredibly inclusive community. Violence, discrimination will not be tolerated.
00:13:14.934 - 00:13:44.146, Speaker A: So sorry, that's not the full link. It's not devpost.com. It will be on hack chain link, or we'll announce it in the discord if it's not already there. But you only need to go to the dev post when you are submitting. So a lot of people have asked, hey, do I need to register it as a team? Do I need to register as individuals? Just register as an individual. And then when you go to submit, that will be when you say, hey, here's our team, right? And speaking of teams, we're going to have some team building events, and I'll talk more about that in a little bit. But for the full list of rules, go to dev post.
00:13:44.146 - 00:14:26.850, Speaker A: And like I said, we will have that link up either on discord or the main site very soon. And for those of you who want to know the rules right now, they're right here. So November 18. So you have a little bit more than a month to build everything, right? So hopefully plenty of time to get something together. And you absolutely 100% need a five minute video. All the source code, ideally like a GitHub BitBucket source three, radical link to your code, a description of what you're doing, and then optionally a link to a working demo. The description is incredibly important, right? Focus on here is the problem that we approached, and here is how we solved it.
00:14:26.850 - 00:15:02.730, Speaker A: Because that is probably more important than all the cool little technical things you did, is what is the problem that you're looking to solve? Because that's what we're doing here. We're solving problems. We're problem solvers. What's the problem you're looking to solve and how did you solve it? So focus on that, and that makes it a lot easier for the judges to understand your tool. So I've judged tens of thousands of these at this point, which is crazy. And that makes my life a lot easier, telling me what problem you're solving, why it's such an important problem, and then, of course, how you solved it. We are problem solvers here.
00:15:02.730 - 00:15:42.780, Speaker A: And again, for products working with Chainlink, they must make some type of state change based off of a chain link interaction. Data feeds, Chainlink VRF, chain link automation, chain link API. So an easy way to do a little lithmus test there is. Okay, did I make a transaction that interacts with one of the chainlink services or protocols? That's it. And you must explain why you choose a layer, one that you worked on and why it was the best choice for your project. Right. So if you're saying, hey, I'm going to deploy this to Solana or arbitrum or avalanche or polygon, explain why that was the chain that you wanted to deploy to.
00:15:42.780 - 00:16:18.920, Speaker A: Makes sense, great. And of course, for getting help, go to docs, chain link docs getting help. And there's a ton of resources here. Okay? We have the smart contract kit, starter kits, which if you haven't checked them out, you absolutely should. They are boilerplate repositories for working with solidity, viper, hard hat, truffle, brownie, foundry. Pretty much everything that you can think of, right? You can fork it, clone it, use the template, get going. Docs are chain a link, of course, and the discord chat as well.
00:16:18.920 - 00:16:53.890, Speaker A: And for those of you who have been around for a little bit, you know, asking really well formatted questions on stack overflow, stack exchange, Ethereum are the best places to ask your specific questions. Right. Okay, great. So now, we have a couple of sponsors here that we'd love to have present. We have Quicknode and Filecoin, who sent in a submission. So let's hear them talk about their prizes, talk about what they're looking for you to build, and let's jump in. We will start with Quicknote.
00:16:56.950 - 00:17:33.758, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. I'm Radek, and I'm a developer advocate at Quicknote. It's great to be a part of Chainlink Hackathon. Now, what's Quicknote? Quicknote provides blockchain infrastructure for everyone. We make it simple to connect the blockchain, to build blockchain apps, and to scale up as you grow. But it's not just about simplicity, it's also about speed. On average, we are two times faster than other RPC providers, and depending on the blockchain or location, it could be even much faster than that.
00:17:33.758 - 00:18:09.942, Speaker C: It's also about reliability, 99.99% or more of uptime, no matter the volume, we can easily handle that. It's also multichain. We have 15 chains right now and we add more regularly. And our main goal is to make developers lives easier, to make your life easier. This means that we have done everything possible so that it's very easy for you to get up and running. And then once you are up and running, to make your life comfortable.
00:18:09.942 - 00:18:57.080, Speaker C: We have great documentation whichever blockchain you choose. Now for all chain link hackathon builders, I have an awesome gift. It's three months of our highest plan for free. It's $299 per month. So essentially you are getting $900 worth of blockchain goodness just for being builders during channeling hackathon. To get this, just go to quicknote.com, create an account, choose the highest plan, and then at checkout, use the coupon code hackfall 22 small letters, no spaces, Hackfall 22 and you get the plan for free.
00:18:57.080 - 00:19:13.710, Speaker C: To recap whether you are building DFI, gaming, NFTs, or social impact apps, Quicknote helps you read and write to blockchain easily. So good luck with your project and happy hacking.
00:19:16.370 - 00:19:40.600, Speaker A: Absolutely insane. Amazing. So all the hackers here who are watching this, you can get that three months of free Quicknode, that RPC provider for your hackathon products to start building for absolutely free. Go make sure to use that checkout code, sign up for Quicknode, get that RPC provider and build some really cool stuff. So thank you so much quicknode. And like I was saying, they are one of our. Let me just switch back over.
00:19:40.600 - 00:19:52.780, Speaker A: They're one of the flagship sponsors of this hackathon. So a huge thank you to Quicknode for helping sponsor this hackathon. Now, the next one is going to be Filecoin and IPFs, and they have a video for us as well.
00:19:56.670 - 00:20:36.520, Speaker D: Hello hackers. I'm Dawn Kelly, your friendly neighborhood developer advocate from the IPFs and Filecoin universe. The calendar says it's October, which means it is fall and my favorite time of the year here in the US for so many reasons. We have pumpkin spice everything. Football and hockey are on TV, the stores are full of tiny candy for Halloween, and it's time for the chain link. Fall 2022 hackathon. This is one of my favorite hacks of the year because fall brings that great back to school vibe and the folks at chain link always put together an amazing educational platform to help us all learn the latest in what is going on across the space.
00:20:36.520 - 00:21:33.462, Speaker D: You'll have access to awesome workshops to learn about essential tools like hard Hat remix, Brownie, Truffle, and Foundry. There will be code along sessions to help guide your development process. I'll be presenting my workshop on winning ideas and how to share them on Friday, October 21, so make sure you get that on your calendar so we can hang out. Speaking of some new things, my personal, admittedly biased, favorite new thing this fall is w three UI from our team at web3 storage. The gang has created headless typesafe UI components you can use to build production ready apps or awesome demos for hackathon projects. These components use the web3 storage service for storing content address data on IPFs and Filecoin. Current supported frameworks include React, solid View, react native and svelte.
00:21:33.462 - 00:22:37.790, Speaker D: These components include a wallet UI for simple authentication and delegation, a file uploader to enable fast uploads from within your app, and an uploads list which helps to simplify accessing and analyzing data once it's uploaded to web3 storage. These components can give you a jump start for leveraging decentralized, verifiable and censorship resistant data storage in your hackathon builds, and I'm really excited to see them in action. You can get a look at them over at beta UI Web three storage if a look at new tools isn't enough to get you motivated, this event has up to $300,000 in prize money on the line. We have tracks ranging from social impact to women in tech, dow tooling, DFI, NFT, gaming and more. Whatever you are thinking of building, there is a prize track to fit your project. If you are not registered, get yourself to chain link hackathon and take care of that right now. Go do it.
00:22:37.790 - 00:23:04.440, Speaker D: Get signed up and let's get to learning and building. As always, if I can help you at all, you can find me on twitter at runforpancakes and my DMs are always open. I'll have a chain link fall hackathon segment in the next biscuit bites Twitter space on Thursday, October 20. So if anyone is struggling with forming a team, coming up with ideas, or just needing a bit of support, please drop by and see us and let's go build.
00:23:09.720 - 00:23:45.810, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much filecoin IPFs for that I dropped a link to that in the chat web3 UI beta storage, so be sure to check that out. And again, for people who are looking for that quicknode promo code. It is hack fall 22, so be sure to use that at checkout when you go grab that free quicknode sponsorship here. So thank you so much to the different sponsors who are having prizes here. All of these prizes will be on the day of post. Like I said, we're going to have that link in the discord very soon if it's not up already.
00:23:45.810 - 00:24:05.610, Speaker A: So thank you so much to the sponsors here. And we're already getting close to the end of the opening ceremony. For those of you who have been to some of these, you know, this is about to be the fastest opening ceremony we've ever had. We got a lot of feedback that people are like, hey, wrap it up, let's get to building. And that's what I want to give you guys. I want you guys to get to building. I want you all to start building.
00:24:05.610 - 00:24:43.264, Speaker A: So communications for all this are going to be through the discord and via email. So if there's an update, be sure to check your email if something's happening on discord or if there's some workshop happening on Discord, maybe any games, maybe that clue has something to do with that. I don't know, maybe. But be sure to check your discord and your emails for updates here. Let's talk about some prizes. Let's talk about some more prizes. Okay, so the chain link grand prize for the tackleton is $25,000 in length.
00:24:43.264 - 00:25:24.156, Speaker A: This is to the overall best project. Well, not necessarily best project, but the project that we thought was the most technical, was the most original, had some wow factor, right? This is going to be the grand prize winner of the chain Link hackathon. So that's the grand prize there. The chain link D five prize, $15,000 in link. This is the best overall project that uses, that is a d five project. Right? So we're talking stablecoins, we're talking money markets, amms, exchanges, whatever. You want to do something really cool in DFI, $15,000 in link for the DFI prize, the chain link NFT in gaming prize.
00:25:24.156 - 00:26:12.544, Speaker A: $15,000 in link for this as well. This is any project that is an NFT that does gaming. I mean, it's pretty self explanatory. So $15,000 in link for the chain link NFT and gaming Hackathon prize, Chainlink Services prize. Now, a lot of you who have been to these hackathons are aware of the services prize. This is very different than other hackathons than other non Chainlink hackathons so this is going to be a prize to a protocol or a project that improves the life for Chainlink developers, or is a new chain link service, for example, like a chain link VRF, chain link automation, et cetera. So this thing is going to be a tool that will help builders build more stuff.
00:26:12.544 - 00:26:36.330, Speaker A: So there are prizes, $7,000 a link, $4,000 a link, and $2,000 a link. There are three prizes adding up to $13,000 in link for the Chainlink services. And here is a quick list of services idea. I would take a quick little snapshot of this, although I'm kind of in the way. Let me remove myself. Take a little snapshot of this if you're looking for services ideas. Now I'm back.
00:26:36.330 - 00:27:22.344, Speaker A: I'm like in the way of all these chain link Dow prizes, $15,000 in link. This is just some type of protocol that builds a Dow, that uses a Dow, that does some new interesting thing in DAos using Chainlink. And of course, I've said this a number of times, if you build a snapshot, IPFs voting integration with Chainlink, with some type of optimistic oracle build, you're probably going to do pretty well in this category. And then finally, we have top quality prizes or top quality projects. This is just a 20K pool of around 40 projects are going to get $500 in link for this 20K here. And again, this is just kind of the normal criteria here. Just build a really cool project.
00:27:22.344 - 00:28:00.000, Speaker A: Use chain linking at some point, and you have $500 in link up for grabs. Yes, definitely smash that like button. So these are the different prizes for the chain link hackathon, as well as the sponsor prizes for you here. Now, again, I want to give a huge thank you to all the developers who are here or all the project managers, all the graphic designers, anybody who's here. And for this hackathon, normally after the opening ceremony, we'll do like a gather town where people kind of hang out, meet up. This year we're doing something different. If you go to the calendar, you'll see on the calendar there are two team building events.
00:28:00.000 - 00:28:32.540, Speaker A: We're going to make it a little bit different, almost like a speed dating but speed team building thing. So it's not today. Those two events are both going to be Sunday. So if you're around Sunday morning or evening, because they're at two completely separate times. So the different sides of the world can be a part of those. If you don't have a team, if you want to expand your team if you want to meet other people, definitely on Sunday, head over to those team building events so that you can build a team, you can network with people, you can meet a lot of new people. And that's how we're going to be doing team building here.
00:28:32.540 - 00:29:10.420, Speaker A: So with that being said, let me move back over. With that being said, I want to give another huge thank you to everybody who's here and who's going to be building. We are about to embark on the hackathon. Your time actually starts right now to start building, start growing, start learning, and begin your journey with the chain link 2022 fall hackathon. So like I said, go to the hack chain link right now. Add that calendar to your calendars. Add the chain link calendar to your calendars.
00:29:10.420 - 00:29:38.752, Speaker A: Go to the team building event on Sunday and begin your hacking. And with that being said, the opening ceremony has already come to a close. It's the fastest opening ceremony ever because we want to give you more time to get out there and start building. We will see you all. Let me switch back over to me. We will see you all in about a month, and we'll see you along the journey. Of course, we're in the discord in that hackathon support channel.
00:29:38.752 - 00:30:13.800, Speaker A: That's where we'll be answering a lot of the hackathon questions. We'll be in there guiding you along the way, and we'll see you very soon. And remember, like I've said this whole time right now, make a commitment, not to me, not to your friends, to yourself. I'm going to submit something I am going to take this time. I'm going to do 1 hour, three days a week, 1 hour, five days a week, 1 hour a week to work on this, to build something cool. Because I know that's how I'm going to learn. That's how I'm going to grow the quickest.
00:30:13.800 - 00:30:37.524, Speaker A: I know other people have been successful here. I know people have built million dollar protocols from this hackathon. I know people have gotten hired from these hackathons. I know some people have just showed up just to learn. So make the commitment to yourself. That's the only way this is possible. That's the only way that you'll get anything out of this is if right now, you say myself, I'm doing this.
00:30:37.524 - 00:31:01.000, Speaker A: So I am beyond excited for web3. Web three is the most exciting, most interesting thing, I think, that's happening on the planet. I'm addicted to coding, and I know you will be, too. Maybe not addicted coding, but I know you'll be addicted to web3 with me and with us. So come along on this journey. Best of luck to everybody and we'll see you in the discord.
