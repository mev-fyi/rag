00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.782, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:00:00.836 - 00:00:20.334, Speaker B: Right on. Let's do it. Cool. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're really excited to have you. And we're really excited to have Charlie Smith, the head of business development from Reserve Protocol, joining us. Before we get started, I really just want to again thank the reserve community for all your support and excitement around this event.
00:00:20.334 - 00:00:45.114, Speaker B: The chain link community for all your support and excitement. We just celebrated one year on Mainnet. Definitely could not have done it without each and every single one of you. Really makes my day. Being able to work with everyone and see the excitement around everything that you guys are doing. In addition, I really want to thank Charlie and Rory for helping put all this together behind the scenes over the past few weeks. It's really exciting to see.
00:00:45.114 - 00:01:41.054, Speaker B: So the goal of this Q A is to allow the communities of both reserve and Chainlink to learn more about the integration between reserve and Chainlink, explore kind of what's been happening on reserve side. They have a lot of new, exciting announcements and things that they've been working on and to just inform the community and educate a little more about the way that we both work together and maybe what some future plans might be. The Q and A is going to last about 30 minutes, give or take. And afterwards, we'll be putting in the description, any links that we talk about, all the links to join reserves communities, to join Chainlinks communities, and anything that will help you research both of our projects a little bit further. So, to get started, Charlie, how about you maybe just introduce yourself to everyone and give a little bit about your background, what your team is building, and what you're currently working on?
00:01:41.172 - 00:02:13.270, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So I'm Charlie. I head of business development for reserve. So I cover everything from sort of stewarding the RSR community, handling all integrations and listings that we do with other crypto companies. And then I also do some kind of work on our go to market strategy. So that's like high level strategy, and then also assessing new markets that might need, have a need for sovereign money and permissionless payments. So I wear a bunch of different hats and.
00:02:13.270 - 00:02:44.346, Speaker A: Yeah. So in terms of what reserve does, for those of you who aren't familiar, we're a decentralized stablecoin protocol, but we're doing quite a bit more than that. So you can think of as a sort of end to end solution to bring crypto to emerging markets, to markets that lack kind of reliable financial intermediaries. So we currently have an app that's live in Venezuela. It allows people to trade between RSV, our stablecoin, and bully bodies. We brought that up to Colombia, and we're bringing it to Argentina soon, too. And there's several other markets that we're actively assessing.
00:02:44.346 - 00:03:33.854, Speaker A: But the way it works is that we have stablecoin protocol that you can think of as a piece of open source software that sits on top of all the other kind of stable assets and other crypto assets that exist in the space. And it means that when one of those is potentially shut down or faces any issues with censorship in the future, we're able to rebalance that basket and keep the stablecoin kind of consistent over time. We have the decentralized stablecoin protocol. We have our app, which is powered by a sort of novel set of fiat onramps. So you can kind of think of our app as something that is aspiring to have the user experience of something like Venmo while leveraging the sort of decentralized nature of a service like local less. That's more or less us.
00:03:33.972 - 00:03:40.850, Speaker B: Right on. So is your app available to download on the iOS and Android stores then?
00:03:40.920 - 00:03:54.402, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's on the Google Play store right now. We have it region locked for now, but it's available in Colombia and Venezuela. And most of our users, there are Android users. There will be an iOS app in the future, but right now it's Android.
00:03:54.546 - 00:04:14.646, Speaker B: Cool. So when you guys are going to these new countries, do you see that people, do you go into a new market by people requesting you, or are you kind of identifying these markets that maybe have instability within their own financial markets and kind of just try to find people, or how do you go about the go to market strategy?
00:04:14.758 - 00:05:32.498, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. So I think it started off for us, and I think this is how it is with crypto for a lot of people. Is this sort of like high level intellectual analysis where we were looking at lots of different markets and thinking, where is there significant volatility in the local fiat currency? Where are there significant frictions on sending money abroad and receiving money abroad? Where is it that people opt out of the formal financial system in large numbers, for example, looking at, quote, unquote, unbanked people? But in many cases, people are choosing to be unbanked because the existing system isn't meeting their needs. So that we'd look at large kind of macro factors and then drill in a little bit deeper in speaking with people and in many cases, hiring people in the markets that we go to to get more familiar with. So there is that sort of like Venezuela was on our radar from the beginning for then, you know, when it comes to other markets, especially recently, given all of the sort of macroeconomic instability that we've seen, we've been getting a ton of inbound interest. So there are markets that we're having conversations now, and it's because just there are people reaching out and just looking at the website and saying, this isn't just a sort of abstract utility for us. It's not like an intellectual debate of whether crypto makes sense or will be adopted.
00:05:32.498 - 00:05:45.660, Speaker A: It's just very obvious that having a sovereign USD denominated account that enables international payments is really valuable if done right. So we've been getting lots of inbound interest now, but it's been us selecting in the past.
00:05:46.110 - 00:06:02.766, Speaker B: And so you kind of have, like, that chicken and egg problem. So if someone's requesting down and say you're in Venezuela and you have reserve, you download your app. Do you onboard other businesses so that they can accept reserve protocol, or is that kind of like the intermediary within the app or how does that work?
00:06:02.948 - 00:06:38.342, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's something we are working on is like merchant. You know, it's interesting. I think the merchant acceptance side of crypto has come a lot slower than people expected. And I don't think that's, like an absolute barrier to mainstream adoption. But I do think it's an enduringly tough problem to get lots of businesses to accept crypto. It's, like, really resource intensive, and a lot of businesses don't want to do it because it complicates their lives. Basically, the kind of main way we've gotten around that is trying to be as liquid as possible with lots of exotic, high volatility fiat currencies.
00:06:38.342 - 00:07:06.270, Speaker A: So you can imagine, for now at least, crypto can serve as a sort of safe or vault denominated in USD. And when you need to spend, you can really easily move into local fiat currency. That's sort of like the dream for now. It's like an intermediary stage, and in the long run, yeah, I think people are going to want to spend this directly, and there are ways that we can do that. But for now, the priority is achieving really high levels of liquidity against local fiat currencies in tough to reach markets.
00:07:06.430 - 00:07:24.410, Speaker B: Got it. Okay, interesting. That's really cool. And so what has you seen as the adoption of reserve within this? Is there more liquidity, like the more that you go in? So are they taking their native currency and then how does that exchange?
00:07:25.870 - 00:08:19.210, Speaker A: Yeah, we've been seeing steady growth to give people a sense of where we're at. We're very much taking seriously the process of achieving really strong product market fit before we do any sort of major marketing blitz. But I think we've made really good progress on that front. So in Venezuela, we've been operating since something like in the mid fall of last year, and since then we've done something like over half a million dollars worth of transaction volume without any marketing spend just to make sure that it works and that users are happy with it. And that's been totally organic. And then we'll do like hundreds of transactions a day on some busy days. And we think that once we start marketing, we'll be able to scale that up, but to give you a sense of the flow and how that works.
00:08:19.210 - 00:09:05.340, Speaker A: So if you're using a service like local bitcoin, basically it's purely peer to peer. You're going to find a seller of bitcoin, you're going to wire them money, and then you're going to receive BTC on the other end or vice versa. And with reserve, we're kind of taking that model, but we are creating an environment that's more user friendly and then also relies less on the sort of reputation and trust that you have to rely on with local bitcoin. It's a pretty uncomfortable experience for most people outside of hobbyists using that service. And so we're trying to create something that is like local bitcoin, but it's familiar. It's using a USD denominated currency and you don't have to worry about whether or not you have to contrust the counterparty on the other.
00:09:07.070 - 00:09:28.878, Speaker B: So that's really cool and I think thanks for sharing that. So South America is obviously a high target. You see a lot of high inflation within those economies. Are there other ones throughout the world that you guys are also kind of identifying with some of these similar traits and that you might see as maybe like the next place that you're really looking to go once marketing and everything really kicks?
00:09:29.054 - 00:10:26.260, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So definitely Latin America is a really interesting case because it in many ways has really well developed financial infrastructure. A lot of good number of people have bank accounts, not everyone, but they're there. There's some burgeoning modern fintech apps that can operate. It's higher friction than doing business in the US or Europe, but it's doable. But those institutions have become largely pretty know, you'll go to Argentina and people have lived through the experience of not being able to withdraw money from their account, like in the early 2000s, when El Core Elito occurred and people were unable to pull money out of their account, and they lived through massive inflation due to kind of mismanagement of the local fiat currency. So it's sort of an interesting one where it's a market that we feel like we can go to at this stage because there is enough infrastructure, but that infrastructure is pretty politicized and functions worse than it should, meaning that there's really a lot of room for crypto to do some good.
00:10:26.260 - 00:11:00.910, Speaker A: The other markets we're looking at, definitely there's some in the Middle east that are really interesting. I think Turkey has had prolonged currency volatility, and there is a really interesting peer to peer crypto market that's growing over there right now. And so if you go to Istanbul, you can buy bitcoin on the street pretty easily. And so I think some of those, like Turkey is really interesting. I think other markets in the Middle east are interesting. That we're looking at Nigeria also is one we've been looking at, but we're going to be expanding more in Latin America. I think that's the top priority.
00:11:01.330 - 00:11:29.560, Speaker B: Right on. Cool. Yeah, that's really exciting, maybe to kind of take a different turn at this. I know that there's been a lot of questions and that the whole stablecoin field in general, there's a lot of new stablecoins that are coming. And so what makes reserve different? And what's the advantage of someone in one of these lower economic countries using reserve based upon something else that might be out there and might come in the future?
00:11:29.930 - 00:12:07.874, Speaker A: Definitely. I think I saw one of the responses to one of your tweets, which was like, why in the world would someone use this in a sea of other stablecoins? And I think that's exactly the right question to ask. And I actually would paint the picture maybe even a little grimmer, that you don't have. Just like, it's not like there's a sea of thriving stablecoin projects. There's basically tether, and then there's lots of people sort of biting at it, but generally not with a lot of efficacy. And so you have, like, USDC that has gotten some real traction by spending a lot of money and having the backing of some really reputable institutions. I think they've made a go at it, but tether is just overwhelmingly dominant.
00:12:07.874 - 00:13:09.362, Speaker A: And the sort of meme of tether being defunct has really not held up too well over time. And I think the reason for that is that tether developed a network effect within the exchange infrastructure, and it's been really hard to dislodge that. And so when you think of reserve, I think we're going for a totally different market. So we're not like a direct tether competitor one day, yes, maybe. We would certainly love to have some market share in the exchange realm, but we're trying to do something that appeals to people who truly need crypto in a permissionless manner, that need to use it for savings and payments in the real world, in emerging markets. And we think that's a much bigger market than the exchange market for crypto. I guess the reason why someone would use us, it's partly that we think the stablecoin protocol, the way it's designed, will make it enduring and will make it last much longer than any of our traditional custodian backed stablecoin competitors.
00:13:09.362 - 00:13:29.246, Speaker A: And then we also think that we're building liquidity and network effects in a totally new market. Like it's very much a blue ocean strategy where we're going places other people aren't willing to go and we're building infrastructure that just doesn't exist yet. So that's like the sort of local bitcoin like infrastructure that you just don't see too much of yet.
00:13:29.348 - 00:13:45.310, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, thanks for that answer. So with that, do you guys use oracles and how do you kind of determine the prices when you're using multiple different coins and kind of piling those together?
00:13:45.480 - 00:14:40.002, Speaker A: Yeah. So the way our development timeline looks is we're kind of dealing in phases. So right now our main priority is growing the market cap of RSV through the adoption of our mobile app. And to that end, we've been able to keep the stablecoin design pretty simple. We have a bunch of additional functionality we're going to add that will require a price Oracle feed. But right now our stablecoin is a rigid index of USDC, Paxos and true USD, which we think is like a very reliable stable structure for our end users and allows us to focus development resources on building a really great mobile app experience. But when we move on to the next phase, which we expect to do kind of around the end of this year, we're going to add a bunch of functionality where basically the collateral assets that back reserve will be able to be managed more dynamically.
00:14:40.002 - 00:15:26.930, Speaker A: So rather than the stablecoin being a rigid index where it's redeemable for like one third USDC, one third true USD, one third Paxos, it'll be that you can have a more diverse basket of assets that maybe some of them have some volatility to them. And that means that the reserve vault manager has to be able to actively say, okay, how much are the collateral assets worth? And what does that mean? To what extent is the reserve stablecoin backed? As those prices all fluctuate, the Oracle will inform the way the reserve vault manager changes the composition of the vault assets and sends out a message as to whether or not the vault is fully collateralized.
00:15:27.430 - 00:15:52.300, Speaker B: Cool. And so I know I have this question. I think some others, probably in the communities do as well. So you have reserve, which is RSV, and then you have reserve rights, which is the RSR, which is. You kind of see people talking about it. So what is the relationship? And how does this work between reserve rights and then the reserve, which is the stablecoin peg, what is the relationship?
00:15:54.190 - 00:16:43.338, Speaker A: So RSV is the product, as far as we're concerned. It's the stable asset that powers the mobile app and it's what we want to grow. RSR is essentially like having a stake in our network. So it's our governance token, our secondary token. And the way you can think of our business model is that it's a lot like PayPal, where PayPal makes money because they bring as many assets under management as possible. They have users holding large balances in PayPal, and they have users transacting and they're extracting a small fee on those transactions, and they're also potentially making money on the float as well. Just having user funds under custody with reserve first, very conservatively, we're looking to generate revenue through a small transaction fee, which we think we can do in the market that we're going to.
00:16:43.338 - 00:17:40.074, Speaker A: Again, it's like a different market than the crypto exchange market, where if tether had a fee, that would be like a serious, a native fee that was significant. You'd be like, I don't want to use this, but if you have kind of a unique network effect in some markets where there's not a lot of where you are by far the best option, you can do that. You can charge a fee on stablecoin usage, and then in the long run, we think you have the vault. If it has volatile assets in it, which you can get some yield on, that's another way of generating revenue. And then in addition, if you have stable coins in the vault and there's DeFi lending protocols, can you generate yield by lending those out in a way that has virtually no counterparty risk? That's also super interesting. So in the long run, you have all these different revenue streams, and essentially, as RSV grows and is used more, those funds are used to buy back and burn RSR, shrinking its supply. And there's some kind of specifics as to the mechanisms of how that occurs.
00:17:40.074 - 00:18:03.480, Speaker A: But basically the idea is as RSV generates more revenue, the supply of RSR shrinks. So that's, in short, that's it. And then in the future, too, we'll be doing some sort of decentralized governance where we'll suggest changes to the protocol, like changes to the composition of the assets, that back RSV and the token holders will be able to vote like yay or nay. Do they want that to go through?
00:18:04.810 - 00:18:17.530, Speaker B: Sweet. Where would you send someone if they're maybe just getting into the space and wanting to learn more about reserve, where's the best place to find good educational content from you guys?
00:18:17.680 - 00:18:44.466, Speaker A: Yeah, so I would say definitely check out the site. No one really wants to read a white paper, so we have lots of short versions of everything. Like we have a short depiction of the protocol on the website. So that's WW dot reserve. I'd hang out in the telegram as well. We have team members there several days a week. I'm there on Mondays usually, and then we have our engineers come in other days and you can really get under the hood and we're happy to talk with anyone about it.
00:18:44.466 - 00:18:52.870, Speaker A: And then the Twitter, I think, is really good. I think that's a good way to stay up to date. The medium as well. Solid. Cool.
00:18:52.940 - 00:19:04.138, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we'll drop those links for everyone after this gets done, after it gets published, we'll be able to drop those in there. So reserve right now it's built on Ethereum, correct?
00:19:04.304 - 00:19:05.020, Speaker A: Yes.
00:19:05.390 - 00:19:14.174, Speaker B: Plan to stay there? Do you have plans to. If there's other stable coins within other blockchains or. What's kind of your strategy around that?
00:19:14.372 - 00:20:17.426, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think we try to stay pretty pragmatic on this front today when it comes to the core infrastructure, like management of the collateral backing for RSV and that smart contract infrastructure that really, it needs to have a really robust consensus mechanism that guarantees that it functions properly. There's just nothing, I think, that's on the level of Ethereum right now. It may be that something else emerges, but for now we feel pretty confident that that's the way to go. And we haven't seen any other viable competitor, but it's something we are open to and have looked at and had projects approach us about has been. Do we want to issue a version of RSV on another chain where, say, you lock up the ERC 20 RSV in a smart contract on Ethereum, and then you issue a corresponding amount on another chain through, like a two way peg. That's something we're open to. We haven't done it yet, but it's not a development priority right now.
00:20:17.426 - 00:20:33.174, Speaker A: But it's something we're open to. But I do think it's most likely that for scaling purposes, we'll end up using an Ethereum, if they're even still called a side chain or something like that. But it could be that we do something else. But I really think it will be all Ethereum based. Right?
00:20:33.212 - 00:20:40.342, Speaker B: Yeah, just kind of the engineering and taking the steps of where you need to be and where the priorities are. Yeah.
00:20:40.476 - 00:20:40.822, Speaker A: Cool.
00:20:40.876 - 00:21:04.974, Speaker B: Thanks. And so I know that the chain link community, we're big fans of reserve. We're one of the first. We both announced with each other about working with each other and integrating chainlink oracles over a year ago. So it's been a while and a lot of collaboration between us. From your point of view, how's it been working with the chainlink team? And kind of where do you see this progressing and where is it at?
00:21:05.172 - 00:21:50.560, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think it's been great. We were glad that we kind of were in touch with you guys and kind of knew of each other early on, before the sort of chain link wave came to be, like what it is today, which is just awesome. And, yeah, it's been great working with you guys. I mean, your BD team and kind of like engineering support are extremely active in reaching out. And although it's not time for us to do the integration yet, they're constantly sending over resources, and it's pretty high touch. So I think that's been interesting because I don't think that I've come in contact with too many other projects that are trying to cater to people doing what we're doing, where there's just that level of follow through. So that's been really good.
00:21:50.560 - 00:22:26.406, Speaker A: And, yeah, I think we feel like a strong sense of camaraderie with chain link, and that Sergey was thinking about some pretty, at the time were really obscure problems years ago, like 2014 or something. He's thinking about the oracle problem when Ethereum isn't really even a thing, which is pretty ahead of the game. And I think at least we like to think that we're also really thesis driven project that's had our take, that it's going to be like a decentralized stablecoin for emerging markets. And we've stuck to that and we think the world will catch up to us too, in the way that it has for Chainlink.
00:22:26.518 - 00:22:38.510, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. Is that why you think that you see so many high profile backers on reserve is kind of just the thesis driven of your team? And can you maybe just talk about that a little bit?
00:22:38.660 - 00:23:19.066, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. So we have a bunch of the investors from PayPal who invested in our seed round, including Peter Thiel. And I think those guys are just like really thesis driven. That is how they operate and that's how our team is, too. It's very much like explicitly being. Trying to be as explicit as possible about these strategic assumptions we're making and then ensuring they're correct, testing them constantly and sticking to it, and being willing to do things that are potentially seem kind of contrarian. Like who starts a fintech mobile app in Venezuela? That's like a pretty out there move.
00:23:19.066 - 00:23:50.134, Speaker A: But we think it's sort of like that's exactly where you're going to find out how to make crypto work in the conditions that it's always said it should work. And so it's like, you build it there, and the idea is that it's battle hardened by being able to function in those markets. And then suddenly when crises crop up elsewhere, reserve will be this very clear and obvious solution that's been tested in some of the toughest. So I think it's basically, it's like the thesis driven approach. I think those guys have it, the PayPal mafia guys. And I think we try our best to have it as well.
00:23:50.332 - 00:24:06.554, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, it's really exciting, everything that you're working on, and it's big problems and problems that need solved. So always appreciate other teams that are really trying to solve real problems and put their head down and actually put out code and work really hard.
00:24:06.672 - 00:24:08.780, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%.
00:24:09.630 - 00:24:21.840, Speaker B: Cool. So I think we're about at that time. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about? You have a few minutes? Anything else that you want to add or maybe that we didn't touch on?
00:24:22.390 - 00:25:12.930, Speaker A: Let's see. I don't think I have anything really to plug too much. I think basically, I'll say this, that we really value kind of the constant interaction with our community. And we try to be really active in the telegram, and we've had so many times where people have come out of the woodwork and been like, I live here in this corner of the world, and we have this very specific problem with payments here, and we love having those conversations. So definitely jump in the telegram at me. The admins are really active in passing questions along, and yes, that'd be great. So if you live somewhere and you're like, there's this really insane specific payment problem that we're facing here, or I really think reserve could be useful here, that's the beginning of how we end up places sometimes or end up considering a market.
00:25:12.930 - 00:25:28.102, Speaker A: So definitely do that. If you have any questions or definitely skepticism towards what I'm saying. Also, I very much encourage you to air that. Throw it in our telegram. We're happy to talk about it. Cool.
00:25:28.156 - 00:25:44.780, Speaker B: Right on. Yeah, we'll definitely show those links again. And then I guess one last question. What are you most excited for in the next few months? I know it's been crazy times right now, but what are you looking forward to and where do you see things happening?
00:25:45.150 - 00:26:34.460, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really excited. We have a ux revamp of the app coming out, and then I always get in trouble for saying dates, so I'm not going to say anything too specific, but I think around early fall, somewhere in there, that's when we're going to be doing kind of our full fledged wallet experience, where it's going to be sort of a new form of self custody that we think is super interesting and user friendly. And I'm just super excited to see the bets we're making on our user learnings translate into the app. And I think people are going to start to see that pretty soon. And I'm excited because I'm hoping and we think that it's going to kind of come out of nowhere for people, which will be cool. I'm excited doing the chain link integration, too, when that comes down the line. So, yeah, that'll be.
00:26:34.460 - 00:26:39.462, Speaker A: That's. That's. So we're pretty pumped.
00:26:39.606 - 00:27:21.814, Speaker B: Right on, Charlie. Yeah, this is really exciting. That wraps up our video q A for today. Really want to thank you, Charlie and the reserve team, the reserve community, as well as the Chainlink community, for all your support within this AMA itself, as well as just supporting both these projects. Really trying to make a big difference within the world, which is very important right now. And then all the other team members, Rory and Nevin, and everyone else at that reserve that was able to make this possible and make this happen. We're looking to do a lot more of these in the future, so make sure you subscribe to the channel, and we'll be able to put all the content, all the links that we spoke about.
