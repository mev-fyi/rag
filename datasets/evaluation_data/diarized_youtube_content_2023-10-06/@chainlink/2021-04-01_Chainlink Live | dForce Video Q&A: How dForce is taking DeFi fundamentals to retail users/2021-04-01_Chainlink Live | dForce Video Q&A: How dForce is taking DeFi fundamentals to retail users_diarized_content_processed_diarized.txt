00:00:03.200 - 00:00:23.136, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome to Chainlink Live. I'm here with Mindao Yang from Deforce. My name is Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs, and we're going to be talking today about Defi and the Deforce platform. We'll get started here in just a few minutes properly, as people come on into this live stream. Glad to have everybody here for me. It's morning, Mindow.
00:00:23.136 - 00:00:30.110, Speaker A: I'm not sure what time it is, where you are. You're background says San Francisco. Where are you from? Where are you broadcasting from?
00:00:30.800 - 00:00:33.790, Speaker B: Actually, it's about evening time now.
00:00:34.320 - 00:01:09.656, Speaker A: Evening for you, morning for me, who knows where. For our audience, it's part of the fun of a global conversation. So again, people who are just coming in, my name is Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs, and I have Mindao yang with me from Deforce. We're going to be talking about Deforce's Defi platform, their recent integration with Chainlink, price feeds, oracles, and a few other things on their roadmap. He's got a lot of really cool things to talk about today, so why don't we get started? Mindow, tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get started in the space? Like, what's your background? What got you interested in this?
00:01:09.678 - 00:01:46.800, Speaker B: Sort of? Sure. Sure. So first of all, I'm very happy to be here today, actually. This is my first sort of AMA in the chaining community and joining with Andy for this event. I actually been crypto for very early 2013. At the time, I was trading bitcoin, mainly doing a lot of upper charge. And then in 2014, I invested in Ethereum ICo, and then subsequently invested in a number of other D five projects and also public blockchain projects.
00:01:46.800 - 00:02:44.840, Speaker B: And my background actually from traditional finance, I was mainly engaged in private equity distress, direct investment, so basically all covered traditional finance investment when I was doing crypto. And then I went fully in crypto in 2017. And at the time, it's mainly on the investment side that we invested in Ficoin, Cosmos and a number of other projects. And then in late 2018, I founded Deforce. We are actually the very first sort of d five project coming out from China. And at the time, there's only a few d five protocols in the west as well. And luckily, we invested and backed by China Merchants Bank International, which is the fifth largest commercial bank in China.
00:02:44.840 - 00:03:41.412, Speaker B: And I think that we probably the only sort of d five protocol that invested by commercial bank. And then earlier last year, we invested by Multicoin and also be capital and we launched our first protocol, actually in July 2019. It's a stablecoin protocol. So we actually started as a stablecoin protocol and then we expanded to lending and trading. I think that for the audience that familiar with some of the counterpart DeFi protocols in the west, I think what really distinguished deforce from the other protocol is that we actually designed very early on to do a protocol matrix. So it's not like we just do lending or trading or asset. We want to be horizontally and vertically do several core protocols.
00:03:41.412 - 00:04:23.220, Speaker B: So now you look at our protocol matrix, we have our yield markets, which is very easy for people to deposit stablecoin into the protocol, and they earn secure and high use. And actually, the capital in the yield market will be supplied to our lending protocol. So it's all integrated. And I think that that's also what is going to be the trend in DeFi, is that protocols will integrate with third party protocols or integrate with some of the in house protocols, and that's the way to achieve the maximum capital, efficiency and performance as well. So, yeah, I would like to share more about what we're doing in our products as some part of the related conversation.
00:04:23.560 - 00:04:50.024, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. That's really interesting, the idea of horizontal integration. The success of APIs in fintech has been a lot about that, where you can just do a lot of different products in one platform, even if you don't make them yourself, you can bring them in. And certainly ethereum and blockchain composability lends itself to that model. Yeah. So again, welcome, everyone. If you just tuned in, I'm here with mindau yang from Deforce.
00:04:50.024 - 00:05:08.070, Speaker A: My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink Labs. We're talking about Deforce. It's a very broad DeFi platform that does lending, it does synthetics, it does yield aggregation, it does a bunch of things. Why don't you walk us through some of the products and just let us know what sort of things are on there? What kind of yields are people looking at, what kind of synthetics, those sorts of.
00:05:08.680 - 00:06:07.412, Speaker B: I think, you know, we have several protocols already been in the market for the while. We're talking about, for example, the yield markets. We already deploy on ether, Mainnet and also binance, smart chain as. And for the yield market, it's very simple, actually catering to the users that's only interested in deposit stablecoins or ETH or BDC to earn high yields. And basically we deploy a set of strategies underlying protocols where the capital deposit in the smart contract will be relent into lending protocols to earn high use. And also we actually help you to mine some of the governance tokens in the background. For example, the stablecoin will be supplied for example to compound and it automatically mine comes and then sell into the stablecoins and then put it back to the pool.
00:06:07.412 - 00:06:53.776, Speaker B: So you will be able to very easy to earn a yield that is actually comprising of a governance token and stablecoin yields. So the users don't need to actually manage the process of interacting with the lending protocol. I think it's also very gas effective as well. This is the asset protocol and also we have our Gox which is a go token. I think this is also probably the only go token that is compatible with the DeFi protocols. Now our lending protocol support Gox as collateral, so you can basically supply that into a market and borrow stable coins at the same time. The go token is actually generating a very good yield.
00:06:53.776 - 00:07:34.348, Speaker B: It's about 16% APY at the moment. I think it's probably the only d five sort of yield go token in the market. And what is more fascinating is Gox is actually a wrapper of pexel gold. So anyone that own pexel gold, you can very easily convert it and wrap it into Gox and then deposit into our lending protocol to earn yields or use that as collateral to borrow stable coins. And the reason we wrap PexelGo is because Pex of go have a very tricky design. They have a transaction fee for every sort of transaction. So in fact it's a deflationary token.
00:07:34.348 - 00:07:50.250, Speaker B: So basically it makes it very incompatible with all the existing protocols. That's why we wrap it into goax and then users can actually interact with the DeFi more easily without any trouble. So I think that's also the asset part.
00:07:50.940 - 00:08:11.980, Speaker A: Our chainlink community is familiar with Paxos. They're a chainlink user as well. So that is a familiar name brand. I was reading about your gold x token. Is it denominated differently than other gold tokens? One of them was in ounces, but not the gold x. It's denominated differently somehow.
00:08:13.280 - 00:08:43.988, Speaker B: Actually go x is 100% comprised of pexel gold. Right. The only difference is we get rid of the onchain transaction fee, which is making it totally incompatible with the protocol. That's why we get rid of it. And the other one is we denominated in gram. So I think that will be making it easier for some of the users to acquire a small quantum of gold. For example, they're interested in buying like 1000 us dollar.
00:08:43.988 - 00:09:25.440, Speaker B: They can do that in the small quantum, it's thermometer in gram, but it's 100% backed by peso gold. As Andy has mentioned, peso gold is one of the, I think probably the only highly regulated physical gold token in the markets, and it's regulated by New York sort of financial services department. So I think it's a highly regulated gold token. And I think that bringing a yield to go, I think is a very attractive thing that we can do in DeFi. Because up to today, the majority of a TVL in DeFi is mainly crypto assets, which is highly correlated. Right. When the market falls, everything just collapse.
00:09:25.440 - 00:09:38.104, Speaker B: So I think we need more uncorrelated assets in DeFi to make it more robust in terms of volatility. So I think the next step is also we would like to borrow more real assets into DeFi as well.
00:09:38.222 - 00:09:45.484, Speaker A: So is that why you guys are starting to move into synthetic assets soon? Is like to bring more of those real world assets in?
00:09:45.602 - 00:10:38.380, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that we look at the whole crypto space because I was from traditional finance background and look at the asset class, crypto as a whole is about 2 trillion us dollar asset and it's rather small comparing with some of the major asset like real estate, fixed income, or maybe equity. But I think that in order for DeFi as a whole to actually break through the gas fluting of so called asset bottlenecks, I think it's very important that we own more assets. And of course there will be like hundreds or thousands times more real assets comparing with the crypto. That's why we do synthetic asset protocol where we can actually basically can mirror any asset that has a price. Oracle, for example, a price feed that providing by Oracle. Like chain link. Right.
00:10:38.380 - 00:10:46.652, Speaker B: For gold, silver, Tesla stocks, Amazon. Anything that has a price feed. That feed by the Oracle.
00:10:46.796 - 00:11:24.940, Speaker A: Yeah, we're starting to see a fair amount more interest in that. I see it over the space as people are just trying to figure out different ways. How do you get these real world assets onto the blockchain? How do you represent those? Fairly fascinating conversation if we have people who just joined. My name is Andy Boyen from Chainlink Labs. I'm talking to Dao Yang from Deforce. We're talking about their Defi platform, came together. Sounds like it was inspired from your background in traditional finance and some fintech in China, and then launched 2019 with a couple of products and now has a variety of products with more on the roadmap as well.
00:11:24.940 - 00:11:36.992, Speaker A: If you're listening in or watching and you've got questions, feel free to drop them in the chat. Guys. I'm monitoring the YouTube so I will keep an eye out there. But if there are not, then I will keep asking my questions too.
00:11:37.046 - 00:11:41.140, Speaker B: One moment, I've lost my doc.
00:11:44.520 - 00:12:03.290, Speaker A: Can you talk a little bit about. I read you were talking a bit about how chinese users differ in Defi from what they prefer from western users. Is that still the case? Do you still see that happening in terms of integrated products versus going site to site to site for yield aggregator and lending and these different products?
00:12:03.980 - 00:13:02.152, Speaker B: I think that the users definitely is very different in China comparing with some of the western markets. For example, now everybody knows that in China the DeFi is actually attracting a lot of retail users, actually not from Ethereum blockchain, it's from finance March and hackle, which is a hobby exchange chain. The reason for that is very simple, because it's much cheaper to use these applications on these platforms, right? I think it's like maybe for finance March and it's like 1% of the gas fee comparing with Ethereum, or several hundred times gas fee savings. And hackle is even more dramatic. I think it's like 0.1% of the gas fee comparing with Ethereum. So there's a lot of retail users because they're very price sensitive.
00:13:02.152 - 00:14:04.364, Speaker B: So actually they intend to use a lot of these exchange chain applications. And that's why we see a lot of DeFi protocols who used to be deployed on layer one, Ethereum layer one. Now consider migrate to finance smart chain, because that's where the users are. And actually the users also not really care too much about decentralization. That's something that I think is very different perspective comparing with the developer or project team. Like us, we definitely care about decentralization, but I think the users, wherever they can get a better sort of transaction fee savings, they will go. And I think it's a positive thing for the whole d five, because for these retail users, they probably will never use Defi if actually it was on layer one and cost like $5000 to use the transaction lending or you markets where they can try out everything on finance smart chain.
00:14:04.364 - 00:15:03.360, Speaker B: So I think it's a very good way to onboarding these otherwise just impossible DeFi users into the ecosystem and when they get used to it, and when L2 solution is ready, and probably they will migrate to L2 and to use all these d five protocols. So I think that exchange has done a very good job educating all these CFI users to use all these d five protocols. And I think it's fantastic. And you can see that all these infrastructures, including oracles, are also supporting multiple exchange blockchain related as well. So I think this is absolutely fascinating thing because otherwise these users would just probably just use centralized services and now we have a lot of capital actually getting into the space. Exactly, because there's so many of the retail users that are using all these applications and not on Ethereum. I talked to quite a number of users in China.
00:15:03.360 - 00:15:19.560, Speaker B: Their first experience when using DeFi is actually on binance, smart chain or heckle, not on ethereum. So I think we will see a lot of retail users that actually have the first time experiences on these low cost platforms.
00:15:20.380 - 00:15:54.870, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm thinking back to 2017 and 18, going to conferences and hearing people talk about it's going to be a multi chain world, we're going to be interoperable and we were ready for it then. Okay, let's see it in a month. And of course it took much longer, but today you can just go on your metamask wallet or whatever wallet you use and switch from Ethereum to binance, smart chain to avalanche to whatever. There's just a ton of options now you can really do it. It's pretty amazing. And that's got to help user onboarding to all the ecosystems. I would.
00:15:54.870 - 00:16:07.652, Speaker A: Fantastic. So deforce uses Chainlink oracles as well. Can you tell us a little bit how the Chainlink Oracle integration works and how you guys rely on Chainlink?
00:16:07.796 - 00:17:00.568, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we built one of the early version of landing protocol before and at the time we're actually running our own oracle services and we have the hard lesson. It's very difficult to build a oracle. Of course, if you actually look at a standalone basis, it's not that difficult. Right, standalone basis. But when you actually look at defaults where we have asset protocol trading and lending and also not just on Ethereum and also binance marching and maybe on Heckle and maybe later there will be a problem on scalability and reliability. I think for a team to actually build an oracle service that can reliably scale up to supporting multiple protocols on multiple platforms, I think it's just impossible for a DeFi project. It's almost impossible, I could say.
00:17:00.568 - 00:18:31.536, Speaker B: And that's why when we are researching third party oracle service in the market, I think Chainlink stand out because one I think know there is also big protocols already using Chainlink like Avi synthetics, and they are very heavily relying on chain link to explain beyond the platforms. And I think the lock value is almost crossed, like more than $10 billion already. So I think that this is a very sort of very good sort of vote of confidence on a third party oracle, because actually we've been talking to a number of them, including all these existing oracle services providers in the market. And also I think that Chainlink is also very good at expanding beyond just. And I think that's very critical because for the new DeFi protocols, particularly for those that require high frequency tradings or high frequency transactions, basically they can only deploy on binance, March and heckle or some of the L2 platforms, it's just impossible to actually use those products on layer one. And we need infrastructure, particularly the Oracle infrastructure, to support this chance for us to make our lives easier. And I think that Chainlink probably is the only one that support so many of the other platforms.
00:18:31.536 - 00:19:50.500, Speaker B: And of course, we intend to just use one because we can basically don't need to worry about scalability because we scale up beyond ethereum. So I don't think that we have much choices because chaining already been providing all these reliable services for a long time. I think a very positive sort of impression about Chenning is I think you guys are very responsive to the market demands. Right? If there's a new platform or new chain emerging, and I think that you can consider the app support for that. And also, when we're talking about synthetic assets, I talked to the team regarding our intention to offer, like stocks and commodities as well, and you guys are very willing to provide those kind of services. And, of course, cost is also a very good sort of consideration in the equation because the gas fee on ether is very expensive. And the upside for using a chain link is because you guys are really supporting providing services to multiple DeFi protocols.
00:19:50.500 - 00:19:56.512, Speaker B: So I think from a gas cost perspective, it's also more, you know, again.
00:19:56.566 - 00:20:01.570, Speaker A: From the fintech world, they played this out in terms of, if you want to provide a good banking application.
00:20:03.700 - 00:20:03.968, Speaker B: And.
00:20:03.974 - 00:20:29.432, Speaker A: You want KyC, you have to understand your customer. You could build it yourself, but then you got to hire a team to build a KYC. You got to hire product designers, you got to do this, or you can port it in and get it from somebody else. You pay a fee. And that's the model that's like, how you build these out is you specialize in services. And so, I mean, that's what the Chainlink protocol is. It's a specialized service that gets data into your smart contract, whether it's computational data or price data or whatever that happens to be.
00:20:29.566 - 00:20:56.260, Speaker B: I think that's the same kind of analogy when people asking that, do you guys want to build a blockchain for an application? I think the same kind of analogy say, okay, we don't do that because we want to run a noodle franchise. Right. We only want to run those transfanches. We don't want to build a police department, a government, and then build a military. Right. And these are some of the infrastructures that you guys provided. And then we just build our noodle franchise and expand it and maybe expand to coffee and the other things.
00:20:56.260 - 00:21:07.140, Speaker B: I think that's exactly what DeFi protocol like Laza are doing. We definitely would not like to just do infrastructure thing because that would be too heavy.
00:21:08.440 - 00:21:46.484, Speaker A: Yeah. And so for small teams, especially teams like you want to pivot. You said Chainlink is responsive to the market, but all these Defi apps have to be responsive as well. And so that's sort of why chainlink engineers are trying to create these price feeds that work in demand to the market, that serve real market needs, is because crypto moves real fast. If you want to build fast and you have a team of ten people, I mean, what are they going to do? You're going to dedicate half the team to rebuild your oracle infrastructure. It's just not financially feasible, and you can't train people in time to do that according to market demand. But you guys have been around for a while.
00:21:46.484 - 00:22:05.112, Speaker A: One question I was thinking of when you were talking about your launch in 2019 was, did you start as only lending, or was it always this big vision, domino effect, lending, yield, synthetics sort of thing. The early days of DeFi are just really interesting to me. How did that inspiration come?
00:22:05.246 - 00:22:34.804, Speaker B: We actually planned it out very early on. We do asset, we will first launch our stablecoin protocol, and then we do lending and then trading. So I think our protocol matrix strategy is very thought out early on. And the reason we start with asset is because we look at whole Defi spectrums. Asset protocol is the most sticky one. They have the strongest network effects. You see all these crazy yield farming over the past year.
00:22:34.804 - 00:23:01.196, Speaker B: Who get the most benefit in DeFi? It's Makerdao. Right? Everyone used Dai, everyone use USDT. Everyone use USDC and they didn't pay anything. They have no liquidity minings, right? And this asset port have no liquidity mining. They enjoy all the network effects and the network thickness. That's why we're looking at synthetic assets and stablecoin assets. Why we start from there, because we believe that was where all this liquidity will go.
00:23:01.196 - 00:23:58.812, Speaker B: You have to have to actually exist in the form of asset protocol, stablecoin or synthetic assets. And the second one is lending portal. Because lending is basically a very fundamental infrastructure in DeFi. The reason the growth is so exponential is because in the first time in crypto we actually have an interest rate in yield markets where people don't need to actually look beyond crypto to find the opportunity to earn the capital because they can deposit in a DeFi bank to earn yields. So basically you don't need to rely on traditional finance for finding the yield or convert it into fears and then sitting in the bank to earn interest rate. So I think that the yield market and lending protocol is a milestone. It's the most significant milestone in defi development, because in the first time we don't need to move out to the traditional world.
00:23:58.812 - 00:24:32.872, Speaker B: Fine, yield. And that's why we do lending. And you can look at all the TVL chart on DeFi policy. Bank makerdao is the asset protocol. And second is compound is a lending protocol rv and all the synthetics, basically all these why the TBL is so large. I think it's absolutely for a very logical reason, because these are the fundamental money Lego within the whole DeFi. So that's why we don't do all the other fancy things.
00:24:32.872 - 00:25:06.564, Speaker B: We just want to do a fundamental protocol. Because I think it's very early on in DeFi, just like for know, traditionally oracle just providing price feed for crypto assets, now they aggressively are sending to other real assets. I think the same thing. DeFi is still very early on. I think that we definitely need to focus on more fundamental piece of the DeFi Lego. And that's also where the most value will be captured. It definitely will be captured on asset protocol and on lending and trading as well.
00:25:06.564 - 00:25:36.540, Speaker B: But trading is more competitive because you actually have a very strong competitor from the centralized exchange. They all have deep pocket money. So I think it will be a difficult, it's a very difficult race in DAX and Amm space. That's why we really not spend too much efforts on those, we just focus on asset and lending. I think it's easy to build competitive advantage in these two verticals.
00:25:36.880 - 00:26:18.924, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, yield aggregator is the next product that combines those things. Right? And so that again simplifies that process of using these really basic legos. And somebody was asking me just recently, what is farming? How do I start farming? And I started explaining like, oh, you got to get LP tokens and you got to deposit them and you got to find the interest rate and then you got to put those in as collateral and withdraw this. And then I just said, just go to a yield aggregator and they do that for you. Essentially saves on gas. It does all of this together and it really simplifies that process. I got a couple of questions from the chat, so we'll ask this one and then I've got a couple of follow up questions as well.
00:26:18.924 - 00:26:23.260, Speaker A: So can you explain what is the use of the deforce token?
00:26:23.840 - 00:27:22.940, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I think Deforce token have several sort of utilities, and particularly because we are launching our things added asset protocol. So basically what you can do, of course governance is the most common utility. You can use that to vote for all the risk parameters within our protocols like collateral ratio, which asset to list and what is the fee charges, interest rate, reserve ratio. And all these financial parameters are governed by the token holders. In addition to that, I think one of the sort of, we haven't announced our token economic 2.0 yet, but I think going forward you'll be able to use DF token to stake into the contracts and then you can earn systematic use. In addition to that, you can also use that to ming all the things that asset that was supported like stable coins in us dollar in Europe and maybe in chinese yen or japanese yen.
00:27:22.940 - 00:28:06.300, Speaker B: And also you can use that to mings, Tesla stocks, apple stocks, gold, silver, et cetera. So it will become a productive asset. It's just not a passive asset. And the reason you mean that is because you can use that to provide liquidity on AMM and you can earn trading fees, liquidity rewards. So there will be multiple rewards that will be accrued to the DF token holders. And of course we have also interest rate reserve on the lending protocol that will be used to periodically purchase DF and then redistribute it to the stakers. So at the end of the day, we want to ensure that all the economic values and value captures will actually flow to our token holders.
00:28:06.300 - 00:28:13.440, Speaker B: And that will be a very significant upgrade of our token economics in the coming sort of launch.
00:28:14.900 - 00:28:35.050, Speaker A: So thank you for that question. So one of the things you mentioned is so you can use the token as collateral for synthetics and you've got an upcoming platform. We talked a little bit about this before we started the live stream. Can you tell us a little bit what does this synthetix protocol look like? How does it add to your platform?
00:28:35.420 - 00:29:27.416, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we are the only sort of protocol that doing building a synthetic asset or stablecoin protocol natively on a lending protocol. You look at Megadao, Megadao is actually a non pool based lending protocol. So it's not very capital efficient, because everyone that want to Ming Dai, you have to put in your collateral in a silo CDP and then Ming Dai. So your collateral in the CDP cannot be reborrowed, right. There's no U there. And also there's a output scalability issue for DAi is that you can only mink us dollar stablecoin, they don't support Europe or the other synthetic asset. So I think they have very limited outputs, even though they can actually use a lot of collaterals to do on the input side.
00:29:27.416 - 00:30:27.468, Speaker B: And you look at the other one is synthetics, which is a very dominance of synthetic asset protocol. I think the issue with synthetic is that the majority of the collateral that you can use to ming things is SNX. It's basically 98% of the collateral is the platform token. And that created issue, because one is that the market cap of thinkthatics will have a huge constraint on the collateral that you can use to Ming think that assets, there will be a natural sort of gas ceilings, even though they actually trying to remove that, because now they supported ETH and also the other assets as collateral. But I think that as a matter of fact, 98% of the assets still on SNX, and they have a very high cartridge ratio. It's 500 times five x of cartoon ratio. So you can think of the capital efficiencies is very low.
00:30:27.468 - 00:31:15.530, Speaker B: And what we are doing differently is that we're basically supporting you to use all the lending portal collateral to mint stablecoin and synthetic assets. And what is the upside of that one is that because the lending portal is a pool base. So basically all the collateral you put there is natively earning you all the time, right? For example, you use USDC to Ming x USD. Our stablecoin, USDC probably is earning like 10% yield. And then you ming a stable coin, maybe just paying like 3% yield. So it's very easy for you to actually do a lot of yield arbitrage across the platform. And this is impossible in makerdao, because all the collaterals are in a single position.
00:31:15.530 - 00:32:27.570, Speaker B: And also it's very easy for us to scale up the input, because we are not only supporting stablecoins and also the other crypto assets, and also you can use the synthetic assets you just mint to report into the collateral pool and then to mint more assets. So I think it's inherently more scalable sort of platform that will be able to allow more natural arbitrage between general crypto assets and the synthetic assets. You look at all these synthetic asset platform now in the markets, I think they are very much isolated. They have their own ecosystem where it's very difficult for this closed ecosystem to communicate with the external world because they have their own system depth designs, or you have to use their platform token to ming a synthetic assets. So I think there's a lot of scalability issue for these synthetic protocols, and we want to do something differently to actually improve both the scalability on the input and also on the output as well.
00:32:28.020 - 00:33:12.912, Speaker A: Yeah, I love to see slightly different takes on a variety of products and see what the market chooses. Different people have different risk profiles, different people have different preferences. And so it's fantastic to see additional competitive offerings with different parameters that people can choose and evaluate for themselves. Because the DeFi space is really pretty small still. It's still growing, and with this incredible growth that we've seen in the past year, still the market is still so much bigger. You touched on this a little bit earlier. What are some of those challenges that new users are coming into defi facing? What, as an industry do you think we need to focus on to make sure they stay? They try it and they stay.
00:33:12.912 - 00:33:17.340, Speaker A: What's kind of like the top two goals in your perspective?
00:33:17.500 - 00:34:16.928, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that the most significant one, I think the first one is regulatory. I think the second one is the entry barrier. The entry barrier, I will tell the second one first. I think the entry barrier is still pretty high because as a typical user that you have to remember seeds, passwords, and you have to use different wallets, and you have to actually just interact with a bunch of protocols where you don't know where the money are going. So I think the barrier is not just like intellectual, right? It's more like psychological. I enter my money and bomb, we go, where is it going? I think it's not like a centralized exchange where you have a very high confidence that your money will be sitting in Coinbase and is secure, and they probably have insurance that can insure against some of the potential losses. So I think that the psychological barriers and also the user behavior barriers is still very high for DeFi.
00:34:16.928 - 00:35:08.388, Speaker B: And I think that gradually those will change, because you look at some of the wallets in China, they integrated very well with the DeFi protocol, so you can use those products quite seamlessly, just like you use some of the CFI products. It's very good. So, Uiux, comparing with some of the other products. So I think that gradually, I think will be greatly improved. And on the regulatory one, I think it's more difficult and long term one, because we know that the regulator around the world is already catching up on the learning curve. Right. They used to be like, know nothing about DeFi, and now they know paying a lot of attention on stablecoin regulation, and not just in the states, I think in China as well.
00:35:08.388 - 00:35:59.750, Speaker B: So I think in the long term, this is a huge barrier for the new users to come into the market because they don't know whether this is regulated or not, and they don't have a clear guidance interfacing with these protocols. I think that's a huge setback for some of the new users. Particularly, there was a lot of scammy projects that actually use the name of DeFi to raise money and do all this kind of scammy, high yield products. I think it's the biggest challenge, I think, for the industry. We actually want to go to mainstream, onboarding more real world assets. I think it's some of the hurdle we have to overcome in order to actually bring the Defi to the mass.
00:36:00.840 - 00:36:34.796, Speaker A: I think it's almost the same problem the retail users have. It's an intellectual barrier of, you can be smart, but there's so much information you've got to process and go through and figure out, okay, what's a scam, what's not, what's an amm, what's not private keys. There's just a lot of information that if you've been in the space for a few years, it becomes a second language. When you move that over to regulators, it's the same thing having regulators try to understand. And you see in places like Nigeria and India, just a ban, like, oh, no, we're just going to ban it. And then they backpedal. And then there's mixed messages.
00:36:34.796 - 00:37:09.100, Speaker A: And of course, governments, just like organizations, are made of many people and different things. So I think those are kind of similarly tied together, although one is a little bit more closely tied to user experience and the other is on the regulatory side. Mintao, this has been a fantastic chat. I've enjoyed getting to know you and learning a lot about deforce in the past couple of days, and especially today. I did my reading yesterday as well and previously. Where can our users follow your progress, ask more questions, and get to know your project a little bit better?
00:37:09.250 - 00:37:47.732, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that for the audience or users in countries other than China, because in China we are quite visible, we have very robust WeChat communities. I think it's very easy to find us. And actually for the global community, we're definitely more active on Twitter. So just follow the default network Twitter. You'll be able to share or have the latest updates regarding protocols and also Telegram group as well. So we also have community managers managing those channels. And of course you're actually more tech savvy.
00:37:47.732 - 00:38:14.080, Speaker B: You can go to the GitHub because we also have a lot of technical upgrades and protocol upgrades on GitHub as well. And I think there will be a big launch by end of April on data asset protocols and also there will be a rewamp of the tokenomics. So I think that if actually anyone interested, I think that you can keep an eye on our developments.
00:38:14.820 - 00:38:48.568, Speaker A: Fantastic. So if you're new to defi and the community in general in crypto, go to these discord channels, have conversations, meet people, ask questions, follow projects on Twitter and come to YouTube, amas and Q A's just like this. We appreciate that you came. You can find d force at all of those locations and we'll put them down in the show notes as well for later if you want to come back and find those. Of course, you can also join many of the Chainlink social media properties as well. We've got discord with the hackathon going right now. Crazy activity.
00:38:48.568 - 00:39:00.732, Speaker A: We've got our Telegram, our website chain link, and of course you can like and subscribe to this channel. And we appreciate you coming today. Mindow, it's been a pleasure. Good luck to you.
00:39:00.866 - 00:39:04.730, Speaker B: Yeah, it's my pleasure as well, Andy. Thank you. Very good. Right.
