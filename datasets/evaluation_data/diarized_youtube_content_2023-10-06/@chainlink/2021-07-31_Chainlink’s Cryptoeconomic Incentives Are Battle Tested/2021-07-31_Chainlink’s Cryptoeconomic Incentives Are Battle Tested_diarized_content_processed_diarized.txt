And it's really this continual growth in security that I think is already driving a lot of the ability of the chainlink network to provide highly reliable price data even through market crashes. Right? So recently there was a correction in the market and things substantially changed in terms of prices. There were a lot of updates by Oracle networks. There were multiple oracles that didn't perform and didn't put updates on chain as expected. But the chain link networks that are relied on by DeFi continually provided updates as expected, even at gas prices as high as 2500. So at the end of the day, whatever you have to say about this, the system is fundamentally working because the incentives and the greater and greater incentives of more and more users is properly incentivizing Chainlink Oracle networks to reliably deliver data accurately under pretty much all the market conditions and all the congestion conditions and all the difficulties that other Oracle systems can't handle and haven't handled as recently as a few days ago.
