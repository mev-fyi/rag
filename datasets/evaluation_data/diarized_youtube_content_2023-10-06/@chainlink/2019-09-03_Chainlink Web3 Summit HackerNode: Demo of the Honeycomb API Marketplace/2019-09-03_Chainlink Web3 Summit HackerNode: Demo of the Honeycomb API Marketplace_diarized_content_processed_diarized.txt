00:00:08.340 - 00:01:08.576, Speaker A: Listing for those. And what we are not going to do is just put up the APIs and wait for people to build on them. We are going to start building on them. We are going to teach people how to build this app and then we hope that people are going to build these thousands of micro devs that are going to use our data services and some of them will stick and be actually used. A lot of the first one is a weather insurance demo, but it is not the traditional agricultural youth chain, but rather for an outdoor event. So let's say we have an outdoor event in Berlin between these dates and I have bought a ticket before the starting date. And then what the contract does is if it rains between these dates and if I have not yet entered the joint, the event then I can get defunded if I can show that it has rain.
00:01:08.576 - 00:01:39.670, Speaker A: So let's say I see that it's raining right now, which is probably not. So I can create a changing request. So what this does is this is asking for a 0.1 e deposit and if it is actually raining it is going to refund that back to me. So if it is raining and I want to get refunded I can take the deposit asking because I'm going to get paid back. But in this case I won't because it is not raining. It is sunny outside.
00:01:39.670 - 00:02:31.110, Speaker A: So basically I'm creating this like in most cases you wait for the chaining cookies to be fulfilled and you just cook away on the button. Instead what I'm doing here is I'm listening for the event, for the chaining fulfilled event. And then the aggregator aim is another event when the aggregator is done. So basically right now this is just creating the request. So we are waiting for confirmations and they're going to be individual oracle fulfilling this request and they're going to present like zero. And when the aggregation is done right now the request have waiting for responses. So where are we getting this response from? There are five node operators right now in this demo.
00:02:31.110 - 00:03:19.536, Speaker A: Two of them are searches, one and Linkforest which are right now listed on our marketplace. Like you can buy these jobs from them right now with real link on maintenance and the other two are linkful and other staking codes and fuse, the guys that are providing ethereum service to a lot of chain codes and the fifth node is ours. So there's a lot of decentralized in the form of nodes. And also we are using two weather APIs for this, Aries Weather and worldweather online. They are both on our marketplace. So we have provided decentralized decentralization in both APIs and node operators. So what we're offering here is that if you are looking for a kind of data as a smart contract developer, you don't have to go look out for node operators and API providers.
00:03:19.536 - 00:03:57.010, Speaker A: We can just gather them for you. We have connections, we already have established partnerships. And if you have not yet partnered with an API provider or a node operator that you want to get third from, then we can go over to them and say, hey, we're already working with these APIs, would you like to join? And they will most likely join. So we can get any kind of data that you want. So basically, there are some problems with Robson. So we may or may not get the answer API. This is real.
00:03:57.010 - 00:04:27.130, Speaker A: It is calling for the current condition to burn it. And one of the fields that it returns is the precision in millimeters. So basically how much it rains in height. So then I threshold it at zero. So if it is larger than zero, it is raining. Or you can of course put a high pressure threshold. So I have some videos in case this kind of stuff happens with Robson, you can fall back on that.
00:04:27.130 - 00:04:58.580, Speaker A: And the good thing is, in the video it was actually raining, so I got refunded. So basically the same thing. We are waiting for responses, but for example, it should actually get fulfilled in like a minute or so, normally when the optical network is working. So it says transportation of 0.2 mm quite low. But since I threshold at zero, it says, yes, it is raining. True.
00:04:58.580 - 00:05:25.096, Speaker A: And then when I click refund, I get it right now my balance is 1.88 and when I get refunded, it is 2.0. So basically 1.1 for the ticket and 1.1 for the deposit that I made to check the rest. So basically I got my money back and also got my ticket money back. So this is one of the cases.
00:05:25.096 - 00:06:02.484, Speaker A: So what is interesting about this is this is right now financially feasible with the current gas prices and current gain fall prices. So we made five calls to the note. So you can say that that will take approximately one lake. So $2.5 and the gas cost for clicking that button is 10%. So basically, checking the train cost me half dollars. And if you insure like 100 event scores and you are probably going to be profiting that amount from a single person and the rest of the profit.
00:06:02.484 - 00:07:07.752, Speaker A: So although the current gas prices are a bit high, we actually got the real results here in the background. So aggregation is complete and this is not raining. So if I click refund here, it's not going to refund me because, well, this is not raining actually. I'm also going to try the second demo live because I guess it's probably like nothing you have seen. So basically we have an API endpoint. We have an API endpoint that can send SMS messages, also send security codes, verify those security codes. So we thought about like in which use case can we use this? And we thought, yeah, this might be oracle certification.
00:07:07.752 - 00:07:55.004, Speaker A: So basically what this does is it associates a phone number to an ethereum address and that address can be an oracle address. So what this does is you can phone like infinitely many oracle contracts and no one would know that it is all you. So you can use those in civil attack, which means like explosion of multiple oracles. But when the owner of the oracles are all the same, it is quite easy to do that. So we are looking for a way to make it more difficult. So let's say I'm just going to copy paste my metamask address here. I'm checking if this is certified and it is not certified, obviously we haven't done yet.
00:07:55.004 - 00:08:46.300, Speaker A: So I'm entering my phone number here's, so this is symbolic cost of. .18 it actually costs like 50, $0.60 here. So what I'm expecting is that's my phone, I'm expecting to receive an SMS and I'm going to have a code here. Then I'm going to enter this here and click verify code. And then the contract is going to associate my phone number to the Ethereum address.
00:08:46.300 - 00:09:29.660, Speaker A: Then I will not be able to associate this phone to another Ethereum address. So that if I want to, for example, deploy multiple oracles, then I'm going to have to buy more call numbers. So basically this is basically an API call. So a chain interface. And this is done with a single node because there's not really any reason to trust the node here because they don't see the security code itself. They're just saying the API sends a security code to this phone number, but you can do the verified code part in a decentralized way with multiple oracles. But in this demo I'm just using our single node.
00:09:29.660 - 00:10:25.644, Speaker A: So again, I'm going to fall back to the video and it will or will not work in the background video. So I have received the certification code here and I have entered it, I have clicked verify code and I'm waiting for it to go through. Then we see, sorry. So we see same oracle address. I'm going to click check certification after I have verified my code and now it says true. So someone else can go to the contract and just ask, is this address associated with a phone number? And it's going to say yes. And it's not going to say the phone number.
00:10:25.644 - 00:11:06.168, Speaker A: It is somewhat private, not really because they can go to the history and check where you send it. My phone number right now is stored on the blockchain forever. I thought, I've regret that, but for the demo. So basically what I do here is I enter another orcl address and I try to send another code but it is going to revert because this phone number is already associated. This numbers have already been used. By the way, I repeat the SMS. I'm not going to do that.
00:11:06.168 - 00:11:44.688, Speaker A: I'm just moving on to the third demo here. So the third one is patting on sentiment. So here we are using two different APIs, but we're doing a single change request. So basically the problem is doing this is you have to pay twice a lot of just cost. And another problem is in this case we are making a call to a news API. We get the article, we send the article to a sentiment analysis API. So it's a language processing and it returns a score like between minus infinity and infinity representing the sentiment.
00:11:44.688 - 00:12:39.048, Speaker A: So the problem here is you cannot just write all of the article on the blockchain because chain itself can write 32 characters. So we should be doing the off chain and it is also more economic, economical. Here, for example, I can enter any story here, I'm saying bitcoin and I'm betting 0.2. So this is a double or nothing bet and I'm betting positive. So basically you would do this for a future date. So you would bet that seven days from now the sentiment for this is going to be positive and you would deposit your bet now and then you would check that a week later. So this doesn't really make sense because this is checking the current news and you can check the current news yourself and decide that the sentiment is posted on the game.
00:12:39.048 - 00:13:28.810, Speaker A: So this is in any obvious case this would be bet on feature news. So I'm placing my bet on post assessment. So basically, again, making a chaining request. And so basically when the event is limited, the chain request is fulfilled. So we click check results and if we are right, it is going to give us back double the amount that we have back. So basically the sentiment for bitcoin are positive and, and she got double our stick. So that's a lot.
00:13:28.810 - 00:13:37.460, Speaker A: I mean, if you have anything to ask about if they want right now, I guess we have any more thoughts.
