00:00:05.570 - 00:00:51.150, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone very much for coming. We appreciate it and for having an interest in our work. So I think the goal this evening is to have a candid conversation with Tom and with you folks about what the future of our space is, that being the smart contract space, which is an important subset of what blockchains and that technology does. So I think we're just going to give a quick intro of who we are, just in case, for the folks that don't know. And then we're going to jump into some of the more meaningful questions, which me and Tom discuss. And we thought it'd be great to share some of that conversation with all of you. So I'll let Tom introduce himself.
00:00:51.150 - 00:01:39.570, Speaker A: Well, actually, I'll introduce myself and then Tom, because Tom's way more impressive than me. So we'll transition on a high note. I'm Sergey. I'm one of the founders of Chainlink. And what Chainlink does is provide data to smart contracts and allow smart contracts to get connected to payment systems. And basically what it allows smart contracts to become is something that goes beyond tokenization by connecting them to the real world, which is a very meaningful step forward, because right now what smart contracts do is they move tokens around because they can do that out of the box, which is great. Tokens are great, and ownership and cryptographically provable ownership and private key based holding of assets is very exciting.
00:01:39.570 - 00:02:01.930, Speaker A: But expanding beyond that to contracts that can actually react data send payments, affect real world systems, do something beyond token movement is, in my opinion, the next step. That's what Chainlink focuses on, building in an open source and security reviewed manner.
00:02:03.310 - 00:02:12.270, Speaker B: Great. So I'm Tom Donster. I started docusign. Gosh, 1617 years ago up in Seattle. Anybody use docusign?
00:02:13.410 - 00:02:13.870, Speaker A: Good.
00:02:13.940 - 00:02:30.562, Speaker B: Hopefully you'll have it on your phone, too. No. Starting a company in 2003 in Seattle. 2003 is a long time ago. If you think about the technology was available back then. We basically just. We made what was already in place.
00:02:30.562 - 00:02:49.660, Speaker B: There were electronic signature tools out there, mostly PKI tools that were actually pretty complicated, and we just took it a different direction. We took it to the web. We made it simple. We tried to hide the complexity, make something that was actually usable across a bunch of different markets. And last year we went public. So we had a good run.
00:02:51.630 - 00:03:40.730, Speaker A: Yeah, Tom was underplaying it a little bit. It's like the leading esignature company that got the industry basically off the ground. So the reason I've always found Tom very insightful is that he's been able to get industry like his signature off the ground and see through to a successful, widely adopted, widely used technology product. That wasn't obvious back when he began building some of the first actually useful solutions. So it's very similar to the position that many blockchain companies like us find themselves in, that we have a very great forward looking perspective. But there needs to be a lot that happens today, and Tom has done it all.
00:03:40.800 - 00:04:08.100, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's really interesting. There's a lot of parallels here in the early days with electronic signature. It was really about focusing on getting a signature to happen. That was a thing, just trying to get a signature. And we spent a lot of time, actually spent the first two years of the company just trying to make it easy enough for a regular person to get through the process in a way that wasn't confusing. And we got it going. It took three years before we tried to sell to anybody.
00:04:08.100 - 00:04:40.410, Speaker B: And we were really looking for that first market where this solution can have a big business impact. You really need that first use case that really demonstrates the thing you're doing. And so we were always looking for, in our case, where a phrase we used to use all the time until FedEx told us not to. We were looking for that place where when overnight is absolutely, positively way too slow. And we used that a bunch. And then they finally gave us a season desist letter, which I really just wanted to let them sue us. And it would have been a great lawsuit.
00:04:40.410 - 00:05:05.730, Speaker B: But those Markets where overnight is absolutely too slow became real estate. Because you think about a real estate transaction, FedEx is too slow for real estate. I'm going to get in my car and drive across town. And so that was our initial target. And we did a deal with one of the leading companies in the real estate space to try to ignite that. They do all the forms for real estate, 65% market. And we built it into the product, into their product.
00:05:05.730 - 00:05:24.634, Speaker B: It's like, okay, this is going to go crazy. And then it didn't. What's going on? This is like right on the bar next to print, it says, you can send it for signature. And it wasn't going on. We actually did some private or some focus groups to begin with to find out. This is the coolest product in the world for your industry. You tell me it's great.
00:05:24.634 - 00:05:59.806, Speaker B: Why aren't you using it? We had people come in, real estate agents, mortgage people, just small business people, and we would take them through the product and explain how it worked and say, that is so cool. That would change my business that would just change everything. So awesome. How many of you are going to use it? Nobody. Okay, why aren't you going to use this? Well, something might happen from a legal perspective that might not be okay. Some technology might not work correctly, somebody's identity might be stolen. Well, no, we've taken care of all of it.
00:05:59.806 - 00:06:36.494, Speaker B: What technology can I tell you we've used or what laws can I tell you we adhere to so you don't have to worry about that. And they said, we're not lawyers or technologists, so you can tell me all that stuff you want. It's not going to make any difference. It turned out, and said, okay, what if the bank of America uses this, or Microsoft or some big company? They said, well if that were the case, then we would totally use it. The company in the early days, from selling to small businesses to selling to large enterprises, which was a humongous shift. It turns out that's where the money in the market is. Bigger companies that write bigger checks, et cetera.
00:06:36.494 - 00:07:12.254, Speaker B: But it was a cultural shift away from the way we've been doing things for 4000 years. And so it took big indicators in the market to let the market know it was okay. And so it was a big shift and it actually changed. The reason it sort of dovetails in our conversation tonight is it changed through that phase from getting a signature to automating a business process, because that's really the problem. The problem isn't that I have to sign a piece of paper. That's pretty easy. The problem is because I have to sign a piece of paper now I have to rekey that whole thing or I have to physically move that document someplace else.
00:07:12.254 - 00:07:57.930, Speaker B: So the real problem is I have this business process that's not automated and I need to automate it for my business to speed up. And as you can see, the company grow over time. It went from signature to digital transaction management, which is the phrase we used four or five years ago, which is all around data and data management. And then now it's blossomed into something bigger, which is a system of agreement, which is the way your company manages their agreements. And as you can see, the company grow. We actually talked about something early days called cloud contracts because these contracts are fundamentally different than the paper ones, right? They're connected to the identities of the people who are executing them. They're connected to a payment, they're connected to a process.
00:07:57.930 - 00:08:17.780, Speaker B: And if you print that out, you broke all of that. So as soon as we started looking at that and started hearing about some of the work on smart contracts like, whoa, this is actually a thing. The business world has been trying to go here for a long time, and I think some of the work that you're seeing Chainlink doing is super important to that end.
00:08:18.870 - 00:09:14.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been very lucky to have this conversation once or twice with Tom. And the thing that I've taken away from it is that at the end of the day, what esignature did, there's just a useful parallel here where it automated a key part of how contracts work a single stage. Right. And what smart contracts, generally speaking, are trying to do is they're trying to automate many other stages. They're just trying to take a bunch of things about dispute resolution and contract management and settlement and all these different steps of a contract that aren't automated today. Now, one of the things that me and Tom also discussed is why maybe that isn't an obvious problem. It's a big problem if you think about how industries actually function.
00:09:14.680 - 00:09:57.938, Speaker A: So it's not an immediately obvious problem in that it doesn't create like a whole new interface, but the way that things actually function, the way that the world actually works on the backend, is in these digital agreements. So what I think is really impressive to me is that Tom and companies like his, they were the first step in automating a portion of digitizing and cryptographically securing a portion of legal agreements. And now, like these cloud contracts that he's describing, one of the open questions is whether there's going to be an open source standard. Maybe we talk about the database thing.
00:09:58.104 - 00:10:00.100, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good analogy, I think.
00:10:00.470 - 00:10:39.790, Speaker A: So the cloud contracts and all that type of stuff. Me and Tom, I've had the good fortune discuss these things with him already as well. The insightful idea, I think, is that since the 80s, people have been selling a shared database. Like, this is what Oracle and SAP and all these people, this is what these companies were built selling is like a shared contractual record. And their pitch was the whole world is going to run an oracle. The whole world is going to run an SAP. And in companies like Tom's, they also have a structured process, and in other companies, they have a structured process for defining contracts.
00:10:39.790 - 00:11:34.320, Speaker A: But now we're going towards the next iteration of that story. And the next iteration is possibly the final one, where there's a single open standard by which contracts function. And then if contracts function through a single open standard, then you open up an entire back end. So you basically have like pieces of code that somebody can take and it can be the back end of an insurance company. And that back end can be better than the best insurance company. To start an insurance company today, you need a massive investment in a back end that manages all the contractual obligations you have. If you have an open standard.
00:11:34.320 - 00:11:50.630, Speaker A: I mean, that's essentially what smart contracts are. So I think I skipped ahead to chain link because I think about that all day, but I'd be thrilled to hear what Tom thinks about how smart contracts will get adopted and this path that we're on.
00:11:50.700 - 00:12:46.518, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think I look at things from a business impact perspective first, and I think if you look at what a smart contract, what does it mean to a business to have a smart contract, regardless of the technology or anything behind it? It's a contract that actually, first of all, sort of an execution engine really is better word than smart contract in this case, because what's happening is we have this agreement to do some work, to sell something, to move something, to ship something, whatever, and we've agreed that certain payment terms will be made, et cetera, et cetera. And a smart contract actually will just do all of the contract maintenance by itself. So if I have a smart contract, I don't have to worry about having a contract maintenance group going through these reams and reams of agreements and making sure they're actually paying things on time. We're taking care of things, making sure, well, ten days late and we have a penalty to pay. Human beings can go out of that loop so much, much more efficient. You also can't not perform.
00:12:46.518 - 00:13:14.162, Speaker B: So we have an agreement that if I do this, you'll give me $10. It's going to happen. Someone can't say, oh, I don't have $10. No, it will happen that way. So if you think about the business impact of smart contracts and you sit down, I did this in Lisbon, actually. I sat down with a bunch of people from all around the world and talked about the business value of smart contracts. They all came away saying, I have to have that, because that would fundamentally change my business.
00:13:14.162 - 00:13:47.946, Speaker B: It would make it much more efficient. And in my kind of business, you're an insurance company, you're a registered investment advisor or whatever. If your contract all of a sudden gets ten times easier to manage and much more reliable, you're much more competitive. We saw this with electronic signature in real estate, you're not competitive. If you can't do an electronic signature, it's not, you will lose. Same thing goes with these smarter and smarter contracts. So what's going to happen here is as these things go out in the world, they are going to give competitive advantage to some companies, and we've already seen that play out before.
00:13:47.946 - 00:14:40.030, Speaker B: It makes it a mandate. Other companies in that space have to adopt it. One of the biggest challenges with smart contracts is they're not very smart right now because they're not connected to the stuff they need to manage. Some of them are somewhat smart for some things, but there's not this robust set of APIs that could connect these contracts to the rest of the world. This is why I was so excited when I started talking to Sergey about what you're doing with Chainlink is that that is super important for the future of this whole industry, that these really sophisticated and reliable oracles get built to tie the fabric of smart contracts to the things that they need to make decisions. Super important evolution in this space. And I think why I'm here tonight is really exciting.
00:14:41.890 - 00:15:58.600, Speaker A: Thank you, Tom. I'm just going to mention what I think is really insightful about Tom's perspectives because I think it's very obvious to him because he's done it over the course of 16 years. But to me, as somebody who hasn't lived through the entire lifecycle of an industry from making it happen to where it is now, I think the really interesting thing is that in the smart contract space right now, we're talking with a lot of companies, banks, insurance companies, a lot of other people are implementing things. And the idea that I've had has been that once a competitor implements a smart contract, once a competitor implements smart insurance or smart derivatives or smart trade finance, or some very competitive, well, some better version of the contract where that contract guarantees payment, that contract guarantees performance. I mean, to me, intellectually and just theoretically, logically speaking, that's an obvious and obvious improvement. If I just draw it a lot on paper, it's just that obvious that that's a ten x 20 x 100 x improvement. It's infinite x improvement if it's the difference between getting paid and not getting paid, right.
00:15:58.600 - 00:16:41.410, Speaker A: And a lot of people are waiting for the space to go beyond tokenization. So to me, email tokenization is like email, and all the use cases getting built right now are the things that came after email. In the initial Internet, they call them marketplaces and e commerce and all that stuff. And I think Tom's experience here is very valuable to take note of. In mean, this is what I think will happen. There will be one or two insurance companies that will go all in and make a great smart insurance product, and the rest will run to catch up. That's generally how insurance has adopted technology.
00:16:41.410 - 00:16:56.780, Speaker A: It's generally how a lot of other industries have adopted technology. And I don't know, it makes me feel more sane that Tom has seen that happen. That's all I'm trying to say. That Tom has seen that happen in real life makes me feel like I'm not crazy.
00:16:57.310 - 00:17:38.110, Speaker B: Well, it's almost obvious that if you have this capability in smart contracts, contracts that can be self executing, and there's a gap in the market for all the connection points that they're going to need to make decisions, it's a huge opportunity. If I'm a developer and I know a particular industry, a particular type of system that would have useful data for a smart contract, it's a humongous opportunity for somebody to actually start building that. We talked about it earlier. I think you think about really successful enterprise software companies, open source versus not set aside for a second. But Salesforce is a very successful company. They've done incredibly well. I would say a big part of the reason Salesforce is so successful is because of the app exchange.
00:17:38.110 - 00:17:40.194, Speaker B: It's because you can take your instance.
00:17:40.242 - 00:17:41.766, Speaker A: Of Salesforce and connect it to a.
00:17:41.788 - 00:18:23.918, Speaker B: Whole bunch of other stuff that other platforms just don't have. I think the same thing plays out here. I think the platform that has the most robust oracles has the most infrastructure, it's the most trusted, has a humongous opportunity to be the platform that people turn to. And I would even say I'm not a purist in any regard. From a technology perspective, I think permissionless distributed networks are fantastic, but I think oracles could be used. I think the docusign platform could use oracles if it's got good data to make decisions. It's a closed system, at least today, but it could use those oracles to make decisions, to make contracts in that system smarter.
00:18:23.918 - 00:18:37.260, Speaker B: I think other applications out there could actually rely on these oracles for reliable data. So I think it's beyond just smart contracts in terms of the value of these oracles. I think it's going to be much bigger than that.
00:18:38.750 - 00:19:38.510, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you, Tom. I guess I can just share my opinion. I obviously have a very long winded opinion about oracles that goes off into like 15 different directions simultaneously. So I guess I will say that the points that Tom made I think are absolutely right. That if you're a developer or whoever's making smart contracts, whether it's developer or somebody through some interface that combines various inputs, somebody makes that easy enough for people to do that, the smart contracts that they'll be making will need various inputs and they'll need various mean that to me and Tom at this point is pretty much obvious. And without that existing, it's not clear to me or Tom or a number of other very smart people like Tom that I've spoken to as to how this space is going to move beyond to organization.
00:19:38.510 - 00:20:07.080, Speaker A: And I mean, that really sucked. We were just stuck in tokenization for another four years. What would be really cool is if all of a sudden the whole world just runs automatically and people keep their contractual obligations because they're cryptographically enforced against data feeds that automatically tell people what happened.
00:20:07.930 - 00:20:18.380, Speaker B: So I'm curious with that. I'm curious, what's your history in starting Chainlink? What was the initial idea and how's that changed over time?
00:20:19.310 - 00:21:02.280, Speaker A: Yeah, so actually, when we started building smart contracts about four and a half, five years ago, we initially thought of smart contracts as these smart contracts. So we initially thought of them as these contracts that know what's going on. I mean, this is before Ethereum, this is before many of these protocols. So we just started out thinking this way just from step one. Just like what is a smart contract must be a contract that knows what happens and automatically executes a reliable outcome for people. Sounds, that's what it is. And so we built a full stack around that.
00:21:02.280 - 00:21:50.550, Speaker A: This is before we had other people building parts of the stack for us, right before we had Ethereum doing smart contract stain and other people doing other parts of the stack. And then essentially what happened is smart, competent folks like the Ethereum foundation and others, they came along and they took a piece of the stack and they said, I'm going to build the smart contract state storage piece. And we looked at that and we said, okay, great. I mean, that seems like something that you guys have the right perspective on. Let's work together. Then we just focused on oracles. So about something like a few years ago, we just went all in on oracles because that's just how we thought about the world to begin with, probably.
00:21:50.700 - 00:21:54.774, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, that's the big puzzle piece to fix.
00:21:54.972 - 00:21:56.262, Speaker A: The other thing is, I think, interesting.
00:21:56.316 - 00:22:53.690, Speaker B: To point out is with digital agreements and smart contracts, there are some core fundamental building blocks that need to be in place for this whole thing to work. And as an adventure investor, I'm really interested in finding those early stage technologies that are going to form this bedrock for this new segment. But there's a lot of other things that wrap this up that we learned along the way, especially when it comes to agreements, literally, we've been scribbling on paper for 4000 years across the globe and there is this cultural aversion to changing things we've been doing for so long. And there are some cultural differences depending on where you are in the world. In Japan, you don't write a signature, you have a hunk out. And I don't know if you knew this, but if I'm signing an agreement and I agree, I just put it in squarely if I don't really agree, but I'm not going to complain too much. I'm going to put it in a little bit of an angle to kind of know that, okay, Tom doesn't like this, but he's not going to get in the way.
00:22:53.690 - 00:23:38.774, Speaker B: If I'm really upset, I'm not going to stop it. I'll put it in almost upside down. So if culturally, if you say we've got this new smart contract, that's just better than the other one, but it doesn't have any of the cultural attributes that lets it smoothly go into that space, it's going to be dragged, it's going to slow down. So part of the trick with all this is taking this incredible new technology that can literally make things ten times faster, ten times cheaper, ten times easier, and then feather in the cultural reality of the world so that it's actually a product people can adopt. And that's the trick when you're fundamentally shifting behavior. There's lots of things you learn along the way. Lots of cultures are different around the world.
00:23:38.774 - 00:24:16.050, Speaker B: There's a lot of legal differences around the world. Even in the US, when we got started, there was one federal esign act, but a lot of the states didn't really recognize. Each state might have its own opinion about whether something's legal or not. So there's still a lot of areas that need to be thought of in a complete solution. A lot of that work has been done. I think in the US, the federal East act does actually contemplate a lot of the activity of an automatically executed agreement. I'm of the opinion we don't need a lot of new laws for smart contracts to have legally binding effect.
00:24:16.050 - 00:24:28.230, Speaker B: I think we've already got them. There are some people who are looking at new laws. I think they mean well in some cases. Some states are proposing new legislation for smart contract, which is good on one hand.
00:24:28.300 - 00:24:30.454, Speaker A: But then if that state says it's.
00:24:30.582 - 00:24:48.400, Speaker B: Flavor a and then the other state says it's flavor b, that's friction. So I think we want to do is leverage as much as we can with the stuff that's already been built here and get a uniform legal framework that makes smart contracts work across the whole.
00:24:49.970 - 00:26:35.700, Speaker A: I mean, one of the other things I've taken away from my conversations with Tom and on this point is that I think that there are already a good amount of interfaces, high quality interfaces like docusign, like other vertically focused interfaces in very specific industries that own a customer and that provide the necessary user experience, the necessary legal compliance, necessary partly and possibly soon, the necessary private key management capabilities in order to quickly get that customer onto a smart contract enabled back end. So I think one of the nuances of our space that's nonobvious is that when people look at iterations of the Internet, they tend to try to look for some kind of new interface. They tend to look for, like, okay, we went from no Internet to Internet, and the Internet from Internet to mobile, and now we're going from mobile to blockchains. And what's the blockchain interface? Right? Like, how do I get a blockchain to press a button up to get my coffee blockchain? And I'm not sure that that's how that's going to work. I think it's more likely that companies that own a customer, that have an interface that already own a type of contract, adopt a smart contract back end once that back end provides enough value to their end user. And I mean, that's. That's very possibly how a lot of this is going to go.
00:26:35.700 - 00:27:39.746, Speaker A: Now, the thing that we need to do as a space is to make that technology good enough for those companies, make that technology accessible enough, and make sure that that technology can compete with their other options. Right? So if Tom's company or other companies like Tom have an option to use some form of centralized agreement, and I don't know what docusign is going to do or not do or any of these types of things, but the goal of our space should be to make a digital agreement that is so fantastically competitive, so much amazingly better, that for them to take that form of digital agreement and make that their back end is a no brainer. If our space can achieve that, then our space can become the dominant form of digital agreement on this planet, probably soon. Mars, if everything works out as planned.
00:27:39.858 - 00:28:04.574, Speaker B: No. And I think from a domain perspective, I think we've picked up a platform here. We built our own. We have a closed system, a trusted network, if you will. We crank billions of contracts a year through that thing. And as we have expanded into more smart activity. I think in my mind it's sort of a question that we don't have to answer yet.
00:28:04.574 - 00:29:30.634, Speaker B: We can kind of watch the industry evolve. I think you'll see we've already done some work with visa and some others in terms of example, integrations of blockchain, smart contract interfaces to the docusign system, to ether, et cetera. I think the question is, what is the most likely way you get a rich network of oracles and other components out there that can actually span all these different markets? Is it proprietary or is it not? And I think in this case it might not be because these have to talk to each other for one thing. So if this involves sort of like IFTTT where there really aren't any interfaces, it's going to be kind of a cluster. I mean, it'd be messy. If, on the other hand, these components were actually built on an open standard where there was intercommunication possible, then I think companies like Domusign should be able to adopt that and help it grow, help it grow even faster to the point where the distribution mechanism for a contract and the security mechanism, the identity mechanism on the docusign platform is all flexible. I don't care what identity tool you use or what identity proofing tool we offer, lots of them.
00:29:30.634 - 00:30:20.700, Speaker B: I don't care what communication is used to tell people about contract status. I shouldn't care which chain is being distributed. If I want an identity or a security thing, I can use my own closed DKI or I can put it onto a blockchain and have it happen that way. So I think from our perspective, a docusign perspective, it's whatever is going to give the business value faster. That's what people pay for and then coaching along the way. Whatever is going to elicit the largest number of components that can be used for these smart contracts. I think it's obvious that if you had a developer network of thousands of developers building very robust oracles, that is the catalyst actually making smart contracts happen, whatever network it is deployed on.
00:30:22.670 - 00:31:13.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Generally speaking, me and Tom have talked. Tom just said exactly what we're doing. Yeah, me and Tom have discussed this at just. It makes obvious sense that companies like Tom's that manage complex contracts through a user interface that orchestrates that contract. Basically it wants to orchestrate more complex contracts and it wants to orchestrate them in whatever infrastructure is the better infrastructure. Then the first question is, is smart contract state stored in a blockchain, a better form of digital agreement state? The answer is probably, yes, because it's very secure, very reliable, and is deterministic.
00:31:13.830 - 00:32:04.810, Speaker A: So that state, once given the right inputs, will definitely change to provide guaranteed result to the appropriate contractual party. Right? So it is a huge difference. We live in such a different world that we don't realize what a huge difference that is. Right. The world we live in is a very probabilistic world where I have a contract with you and maybe I don't fulfill my end, maybe I don't pay, maybe somebody doesn't pay me, maybe something happens, maybe somebody changes their mind, maybe, who knows, right? That's like literally the world we all live in. And the better world is the world where if somebody performs, they get what they're due. If somebody makes a commitment and certain things happen out in the world, then they fulfill that commitment automatically.
00:32:04.810 - 00:32:18.960, Speaker A: That's a fantastic world from a contract perspective, when you can have complete contracts basically in as many places as. So then the first question is.
00:32:20.850 - 00:32:21.214, Speaker B: Do.
00:32:21.252 - 00:33:16.900, Speaker A: Blockchain based smart contracts enable that? I mean, they do. They're the only infrastructure that has that property. So that really is to believe that Tom's end users would want that. And then if Tom's end users want to do something with that other than move tokens, then it makes sense that they need reliable inputs that reliably trigger that contract in a way that maintains that determinism, that maintains that property of, you will definitely get what you're owed if you do what you said. You mean essentially, that's where oracles come in. That's where Chainlink comes in. That's where the ability to reliably trigger and reliably conclude a contract that's stored in this different blockchain based format is what's needed and what's missing and what needs to exist for the types of contracts we're all interested in to move forward.
00:33:16.900 - 00:33:23.686, Speaker A: Tom, I think maybe there's one or two examples. You had an interesting example earlier, this.
00:33:23.788 - 00:34:12.930, Speaker B: Sure, sure. So a couple years ago I was talking to the California Department of Transportation. They manage long haul trucking, and you drive a truck into California, you end up with a piece of paper that you're siding on depending on how heavy the truck is, like six or seven different places. And their problem was they have a form and they have a promise to pay from the trucking company, and they have to go through this process where literally the driver signing off to wait, different weights, they go through the state. The business problem was they were six months behind getting paid because it took a long time for that, actually, to get happen and then gets filed, and then the proper person to make sure the company is paying and blah, blah, blah. And this also talks to the term smart contract, because on one hand, I'll tell you, it's a terrible name for what is actually happening. It's more of an execution engine.
00:34:12.930 - 00:34:51.946, Speaker B: On the other hand, I'll tell you, the term smart contract is actually brilliant. We used to talk about templates. Templates is a really bad marketing term because people have no idea what that is. So if you tell this customer, hey, you could make a template that would actually do all that work for you. They kind of glaze over. But if you say, hey, if you actually turn your contract into a smart contract that'll actually do that work on the fly so you don't have to follow up and make it happen, then the first thing they say is, okay, how do I build a smart contract? What's involved in that? They may have, well, been asking, how do I build a template? But the word smart contract just made more sense. So basically, in their case, you say you have this thing that needs to be signed.
00:34:51.946 - 00:35:37.070, Speaker B: We can do that electronically. You have a payment that needs to be made based on weight. That's a formula you can actually build, and you can actually preset this so that as this digital form goes through the process of following the truck around the state of California, it's automatically making payments. And this is pre ether, pre anything. This is just solving a business problem. But it's a good example of an area where the overweight follow up and contract administration is actually costing the state of California six months, being late to getting paid and having to hire hundreds and hundreds of people to try to manage it. You can see how crystal clear a smart contract, in that case, just makes so much sense for that business problem.
00:35:37.070 - 00:35:58.230, Speaker B: And there are so many business problems that they don't seem obvious because we've accepted that that's just how it works. Well, you have to just take three weeks to do this because it has to follow this arcane path. So that's why it's kind of hard for people to come up with. Here's all the great examples for smart contracts. We've already accepted stuff that we don't have to accept anymore.
00:35:58.890 - 00:36:51.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this example, when Tom shared with me earlier, was a very interesting one, where you literally have thousands of these truck drivers with data coming off of their vehicles. You literally have all these stops recording their weight, and you literally have a simple formula to decide how much they should pay. The state of California all of that can be made programmatic, all of that can be made secure and tamper proof so that nobody can collude or game how much somebody should be paying. And it could all be made to work completely automatically. But it just doesn't. I mean, it just doesn't, because for whatever reason, the confluence of centralized technologies that exist today to solve that problem, they don't solve that problem. They don't solve that problem in a way that people have adopted a solution.
00:36:51.362 - 00:36:54.614, Speaker B: And in so many cases, they don't really even know that's a problem.
00:36:54.812 - 00:38:17.090, Speaker A: Yeah. This is the thing that I don't think is obvious to folks in San Francisco, in places where a lot of people work on consumer mean. I think the reason Tom and I and some folks in the smart contract space really appreciate the impact of the space is because we've ended up talking to the end users, we've ended up talking to the people who manage how an agreement works today and how its failure means that truckers don't get paid or something else doesn't happen, or maybe somebody can't have insurance or some other real world problem exists. And I think this is the slight disconnect that exists in certain people's minds. Like, they can't see the exact connection between. How does changing the way all digital agreement works change how something works in a better way? I mean, I can, I can understand that. Me and Tom, we work with people every day that they have digital agreements and they don't work, or they have paper and they spend three weeks mailing paper to each other, and then something gets lost and somebody loses a few million dollars.
00:38:17.090 - 00:39:09.522, Speaker A: And then that means 20 people got fired because the company lost money, and then there's 20 people that are fired. Okay. Not good. Right? So I think, I think the, the place I was going with this was that if, if you really want to understand the value of smart contracts and the value of the more complex smart contracts, in my experience, it's useful to find a use case or two that you can understand why it's important, because those use cases are very important, but they're not as immediately intellectually accessible as I can now send my photo to my friend. They're a little bit more complex. They require a little bit more kind of like, let me really think about what this does.
00:39:09.656 - 00:39:32.346, Speaker B: It's also really fun, I think, too, because a lot of people talk electronic signatures. That's a really boring industry. You're going to fall asleep crazy. But what's interesting is we're taking something that was really frustrating for people and actually making it simple. And with smart contracts, it gets even simpler. And the impact of that is very interesting. I talk to customers all the time.
00:39:32.346 - 00:39:41.500, Speaker B: Like, I love docusign. It's so cool. It's like, I love the fact you love it. That's really cool. But that's not really that cool. Why are you so happy?
00:39:42.430 - 00:39:43.806, Speaker A: And we did some research and we.
00:39:43.828 - 00:40:05.350, Speaker B: Found out we were getting credit for what they were actually accomplishing. I love docusign. My kid got into university with docusign, like, no, your kid did really well in school. I bought my house because of docusign. No, you bought your house because you had money. And we made it a lot easier. And it was really frustrating for you before, and now it made you happy.
00:40:05.350 - 00:40:37.466, Speaker B: So you're really super pumped about it. And so I think from a product person and developer, when you hear that kind of feedback from people, it's super energizing. And I think we're not done in the automation of this. Obviously, smart contracts are going to get smarter and smarter and smarter. The oracle is going to be brilliant, and then we're going to have to think about what's next after that. But the cool thing about this particular space is you're taking something that's super frustrating to a lot of people and making it easy. And the feedback you get is just really empowering.
00:40:37.466 - 00:40:38.480, Speaker B: It's really fun.
00:40:39.490 - 00:41:30.850, Speaker A: Yeah. I think at the end of the day, this just goes back to one of the points we touched on earlier. I think one of the big beneficiaries of this technology are going to be the people who have a front end that allows people to benefit from a better contractual relationship, that allows people to go from, I always used to do these business deals where I would promise some kind of service, like a marketing service, other service, and I would constantly not be paid. I wouldn't get paid for my service. I would have spent 20 hours that week and I wouldn't have gotten paid. And then Docusign or a company with an interface came along and gave me a smart contract that got me paid. And now I do my work and I get paid and I can pay my rent.
00:41:30.850 - 00:41:55.640, Speaker A: I think at the end of the day, I think it's a seismic shift in how the world works. And then people probably attribute the actual change to the interfaces they end up using because that's what happened with the esignature. That's what's happened with a lot of things.
00:41:56.890 - 00:42:08.060, Speaker B: So, Sergey, tell me how we get there from here. What are the things that need to happen in the industry, in the market for thousands of oracles to get out there and use?
00:42:09.230 - 00:43:00.030, Speaker A: Well, it's the cycle, so it's a shaken and egg problem. So on the one end, you need users that use the oracles, and then for the users that use the oracles, they need oracles to exist to build the contracts they're going to use. So it's essentially what's called the chicken and egg cycle. And you have to solve one side of the equation. So in order for the types of smart contracts that people want to buy, there need to be the oracles that allow those contracts to exist. So that's the end of the equation that we're just approaching it from, of kind of, let's make all the inputs and outputs somebody would need to build the types of contracts that Tom's users would want to consume. Let's allow people to slowly build those contracts until they hit on 510 15 world changing great smart contract use cases.
00:43:00.030 - 00:43:18.770, Speaker A: And then that cycle will just continue. It'll just continue to the point that those 510 15 great world changing use cases, those will change how industries work because anybody in that industry who doesn't provide that type of contractual guarantee will no longer be competitive.
00:43:21.270 - 00:43:22.980, Speaker B: Where do you think it happens first?
00:43:25.210 - 00:44:12.098, Speaker A: I think realistically, in my experience, it's much easier to take people from, I already have a digital agreement of some type to, I have a better digital agreement which is essentially with smart contract. So I think the places where it'll be difficult is places like, or take longer, even though it'll have huge impact, is places like trade, finance, where people are still using paper. They're literally still using paper and byte message of couriers. So it's very difficult to take you from that to digital contracts to super digital contracts in the form of smart contracts. It's much easier to take really just the way of thinking about it. So it's kind of like what industries already use digital contracts? Okay. Derivatives and insurance.
00:44:12.098 - 00:44:45.360, Speaker A: Okay. What categories of digital contracts in these industries would benefit from the unique properties of a smart contract? Yes, there are many different categories in these industries. Right. Insurance has a huge trust problem where people don't get paid. Derivatives has a huge problem where they don't settle, they don't do what they're supposed to do. And these people are already using digital contracts. So I think it's going to be in an industry like that where we're taking them from simple digital contracts to more complex ones.
00:44:45.360 - 00:45:10.950, Speaker A: I think we have a little bit of time left. I think we can go for some questions if that works. Okay, this might take a moment. We can get this question out. So we're going to run. Thanks after. First of all, thank you for doing this talk and it's been very helpful.
00:45:10.950 - 00:45:43.486, Speaker A: So I think I want your opinion on what you feel the relationship between public blockchain, which is I think what everyone thinks about when they hear about blockchain versus private blockchain, the communication between those two and how we prevent this kind of walled garden effect of happening of we have apple products and Google products and they have their own ecosystem, they don't intercommunicate well. And in the case of a smart.
00:45:43.518 - 00:45:45.486, Speaker C: Contract, if you have these little walled.
00:45:45.518 - 00:46:56.658, Speaker A: Garden, private chain blockchains don't interoperate well, you have to be more active with smart contract oracles implementing zero knowledge functions and so you're going to be more proactive chasing down. Okay, well, how do we implement a zero knowledge function in these? I think I understand your question. The way I view public and permission chains, it's really just a spectrum. So the permission chains, as they grow, if they succeed, if a permission chain is always going to have five participants, then fine, then it's some kind of Internet. And whoever's making that Internet for you, you better really cross your fingers that that Internet that they sell you is going to be compatible with the Internet of contracts of tomorrow. Because if it's not, you're going to throw it all out. Now, if it's not going to stick with that five person group, if it's like a bank consortium chain, then that permission environment will just grow right as it succeeds.
00:46:56.658 - 00:47:30.500, Speaker A: Say we have some kind of vertically focused derivatives chain and it just wins. It just becomes the one. So now there's ten banks, 20, 5100, 200, 300. And so the more it succeeds, the more it looks like a public chain is basically what happens. Sure, but from a privacy standpoint on a public chain you can see whatever the hell is on it. And I don't necessarily want people to know what is in my bank account on a public chain. I would much rather a smart contract saying, okay, well I'm going to communicate with this private chain which has my bank information via a zero knowledge function.
00:47:30.500 - 00:48:31.042, Speaker A: Yeah, that'll make sense. Assume that private chain can process that and verify that, and that can be the role of an oracle. Essentially the more detailed answer to your question, I think you have a slightly more detailed question than I understood, is that you can have oracles that orchestrate the relationships between the private and the public chains and the way an oracle network, like Chainlink views, that is, where is the data? Where is the payments? So if the payment event or the data event you want is in another chain, then chainlinks can get that. Now that we've established what that idea is, I want to know what you're going to do about it because as the person is providing oracles, you're going to probably be the one that has to orchestrate between these walled gardens who don't want to talk to me anymore. Yeah. So what that really hinges on is on the private key on two things. Well, it hinges on the private key management capabilities of an oracle because essentially what that'll mean is that an oracle.
00:48:31.042 - 00:49:28.602, Speaker A: Well, depends if you want to broadcast or just process things. If you just want to process things, well, then the public key needs to be permission. Long story short, it comes down to the private key management of the oracle and its ability to interact with multiple chains. So as long as you have an oracle that can securely maintain a private key through security procedures like trusted hardware or other procedures, maybe snor signatures to multiple signers, whatever other procedure you want to implement, then that's key step number one. Key step number two is that you have an Oracle network is you have a place that you can go to that will integrate with all the different spaces you want to use. Like as a developer, you don't want to be building an app and then realize, oh, I want to do something over there in that part of the world and oh, no, I can't, right, I can't talk to that chain or I can't talk to that API. That's the world developers live in all day.
00:49:28.602 - 00:49:58.180, Speaker A: Smart contract developers, that's like their world today. The first piece of it is a secure, actual oracle, a secure oracle, not a piece of junk, a good secure oracle. And then the second piece of it is a wide breadth of all the connectivity you would find useful is the general answer. Okay, yes, sorry.
00:50:00.710 - 00:50:57.430, Speaker B: So when it comes to binding legal contract to a smart contract, where does that relationship become fuzzy and where is it clear? I think this gets to what a lot of people have said, that smart contracts will get rid of lawyers. I don't think that's actually going to happen. I think it's going to change what attorneys actually can do because at the basis of an agreement it's something we intend to happen. And right now that's captured by an attorney writing words on a piece of paper and they spent a lot of time and a lot of money doing that. We need to now translate those words, those intents into code. So I think to that end, you're going to see lawyers having to understand code in a way that they've never had to before, because your smart contract is going to be based on something you want to happen, and there's going to have to be a one to one connection between that legal agreement and the code that gets executed.
00:51:00.250 - 00:51:46.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Tom knows a very big deal about mean. At the end of the day, I think it'll come down to there may be specific clauses that reference smart contract systems, like they reference centralized systems. So you already see this in certain use cases like derivatives. So derivatives, they reference the DTCC or other repositories that store the state of the derivative in digital form. And so what you'll see is you'll see those same clauses, except they won't reference a DTCC repository. They'll reference the smart contract infrastructure under the namex. That's how I think it'll evolve initially, but then over the long term, it'll probably go through just like core precedents, is my guess.
00:51:47.370 - 00:52:37.154, Speaker C: Andrew on the blockchain spices. And that actually is a beautiful lead into my question, that because smart contracts are auto executing, you have the problem. One of dispute resolution, reversibility, and two, jurisdictionality. If I've got something that's tracking spices coming in from India and my counterparty in Tamil Nadu records something there, the smart contract executes when it gets Elizabeth, New Jersey. Turns out it's not what it's supposed to be. Now I've got to unwind physical code and transactions as opposed to before in a trade system where I don't pay until I receive. My lawyers can say the contract was established in New York, state of New York, and that's where it's going to have ADR resolution.
00:52:37.154 - 00:52:53.580, Speaker C: And so I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you handle the actual legal nuts and bolts of a smart auto executing piece of code that can wreak havoc in the 90 days it takes to have the physical object catch up to it.
00:52:55.790 - 00:53:34.280, Speaker A: Yeah. So wreak havoc is not what we're going for. If you've written a smart contract that's wreaking havoc on your transaction, get somebody else to write that one for you. I think your insight here and your accurate point here is that these contracts have fewer fallback systems. And essentially that is the case. Essentially what you're doing is you're saying, I'm going to front load 10% more time to get rid of 90% of the management headache related to a contract. Sometimes that results in non payment at all.
00:53:34.280 - 00:54:29.270, Speaker A: I'm basically going to make it so that this contract happens efficiently. So efficiency doesn't allow 16 fallback triple checks by some guy who gets paid thirty k or whatever, doesn't care. Right. You can't have both. So you can either have a well written contract that's very efficient, has reliable data feeds and those data feeds are good and the way it's written is good and it's not a rehab contract and it actually provides that efficiency, then great. If your smart contract, let's make a smart contract that you paid in my house the right shade of blue, that's a wreak havoc. Don't turn that into a smart contract.
00:54:29.270 - 00:54:45.120, Speaker A: Let's do a contract that the truck the state border via gps, the truck weighs this much at stop one, two and three from very secure cryptographically proven data feeds. That's a good one.
00:54:46.130 - 00:54:57.426, Speaker C: I think that just to follow on on that, that works well in advanced economies. If you want to see actual penetration, especially in emerging markets, you have to.
00:54:57.448 - 00:54:58.542, Speaker B: Deal with the uncertainty.
00:54:58.606 - 00:55:02.050, Speaker C: And so I would encourage you to think about that as you build your systems.
00:55:02.870 - 00:55:42.142, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean one way to do this is you build exit patches and you have people with signatures say that we're taking the contract to state x or statewide. You can always have an oracle as part of a multi signature where it's one of the signatures. Then you need an approval from another person. You can do that? Yeah, you can do that. Realistically in the emerging markets is where I think a lot of this efficiency will have the biggest impact. Because in the emerging markets is where a lot of people end up not getting paid because they can't come to the US and sue somebody. Even though the container ship arrived and it cleared customs, border protection and 50 other wacky things.
00:55:42.142 - 00:56:03.720, Speaker A: Just like the person over here can't go over there. Well the person over here can go over there and sue. The person over there can't come over here and sue. So the person over there goes from not probabilistic, they go from unreliable to liable. So it's big. Thank you. You're welcome.
00:56:03.720 - 00:56:07.400, Speaker A: Yes.
00:56:12.750 - 00:56:14.806, Speaker B: Question for docusign.
00:56:14.918 - 00:56:17.386, Speaker A: So you're a trusted company in that.
00:56:17.408 - 00:56:24.720, Speaker B: Space and now you're offering blockchain. So if you have a blockchain offering in your portfolio, how is that going?
00:56:26.050 - 00:56:27.870, Speaker A: How do you sell this?
00:56:27.940 - 00:56:29.022, Speaker B: Any tips you can give?
00:56:29.076 - 00:56:30.986, Speaker A: How this blockchain?
00:56:31.098 - 00:56:56.438, Speaker B: Yeah, it's still experimental. The platform itself isn't built on blockchain. It's built on a trusted network. You set up a contract. It executes based on the rules you put in the contract, but it's not on a distributed network. What is on a distributed network is you can actually have the results of the contract data go into the Ethereum blockchain today and build applications on that. That leverages the ethereum cryptographic functions, et cetera.
00:56:56.438 - 00:57:28.386, Speaker B: But it's all very experimental. We put it out there for our customers of app to be able to use this technology to start experimenting with it. But there's no, the best example we did, we did a car leasing and insurance app, demo app with visa to demonstrate what it might be like. And there were a lot of people who were really interested in that. They actually thought we built it, so they wanted to buy it after we showed it in money 2020. But it was just sort of a concept thing. But there's a lot of promise there.
00:57:28.386 - 00:57:59.920, Speaker B: It's just, look, these big companies that build these big it projects are just kind of slow. They're dealing with thousands of customers, and the last thing they want to do is break what they already have. So they're just notoriously slow. I think you'll find in some developing parts of the world where there's a bigger need for that, where it might happen faster, and there'll be some markets where this actually has such a fundamental improvement in business that it'll become a mandate. I just haven't quite seen that yet.
00:58:04.130 - 00:58:11.246, Speaker A: So this question is for you, Sergey, as far as the network of nodes goes beyond just competition and just like.
00:58:11.268 - 00:58:13.506, Speaker B: The rating of the reliability of the.
00:58:13.528 - 00:58:25.830, Speaker A: Nodes, do you have any plans to have a mechanism or a system by which you discourage monopolization of the network, where you get sort of like a bit main of chain link nodes.
00:58:27.610 - 00:58:27.974, Speaker B: Just.
00:58:28.012 - 00:58:32.294, Speaker A: Like encourage diversity in the network? And do you plan on needing to step in or you think that's something.
00:58:32.332 - 00:58:35.720, Speaker B: That could be solved by the system itself?
00:58:37.050 - 00:59:17.030, Speaker A: Yes. At the end of the day, our system can be viewed in two ways. One way to view it is the way I think you're viewing it, and it's an appropriate way, is that people are essentially, it's a new form of mining. So they're mining inputs into various chains. So it's a way to mine inputs and outputs out of whatever chain needs inputs and outputs, which, if smart contracts go somewhere, is going to be pretty much a lot of not all of it. So that's one way to view it. Another way to view it is a marketplace where essentially the end user makes a decision about the security they're purchasing.
00:59:17.030 - 01:01:19.434, Speaker A: So that decision goes along a few dimensions. One dimension is how many independent node operators do I need? Do they run sgx? Can they provide me some version of zero knowledge groups? Do they use some homomorphic encryption? Whatever other layers of security might be offered? And so the answer to your question is that unlike other networks where people are forced into a predetermined mining scheme, in a marketplace scenario a user can determine essentially the type of nodes he wants. And in that case, if an important dimension of that becomes I want assurance or I want different node operators, or I want assurance that different data centers are being used, or we're not just using AWS, I have a node that's on AWS, I have a node that's on azure, I have a node that's on Google. If these types of assurances become important to people, then the flexibility we luckily have is the ability for them to say, to just choose those mean, how would that look? I mean, that would look like probably certification of certain facts about that oracle cryptographically or through some other means, and then people would purchase that and those oracles would be able to charge a premium for mean. The answer to your question is what people want to pay for is what oracle node operators will eventually mean. Does that answer your more or less. But if there's one particular really necessary data feed that only one node or group of nodes has access to, could they theoretically kind of like guard that data? Oh yeah, if it's your data, it's your data, there's nothing you can do about that.
01:01:19.434 - 01:01:56.886, Speaker A: You can get multiple nodes to verify that one source. But if an official data source says, I'm selling my official data only this way, and they sell it that way, I mean, it's their data, what can we do, right? That's fine if you need redundancy. If people are willing to pay for redundancy of data, then there are probably other places where they can get the same data and that could work. Can you talk a little bit about who's buying from Chainlink today? We're all linked as we're here, and it looks like there's a lot of.
01:01:56.908 - 01:01:58.742, Speaker B: Activity going on on the supply side.
01:01:58.876 - 01:02:02.874, Speaker A: But I view you guys as kind of a leading indicator because of the richness that you can bring to this.
01:02:02.912 - 01:02:05.098, Speaker B: So as a leading indicator, where are.
01:02:05.104 - 01:02:06.214, Speaker A: You guys getting attraction?
01:02:06.262 - 01:02:10.240, Speaker B: Where are people? What industries are people buying from you guys right now?
01:02:11.730 - 01:03:02.394, Speaker A: So there's a few categories. I think it splits between, it focuses on the folks that have digital agreements already, so derivatives and insurance, and then there's a number of on chain financial products or various on chain kind of crypto startups. So a, there's a multitude of different crypto startups that are building various contracts that need data feeds to function, and it's unclear as to which of them will succeed. And then after that, it's various industries where this technology is going to take off. First it's going to be derivatives and various, just so you know, derivatives and prediction markets and betting it's all the same thing. It's all different words from the same thing. Yeah.
01:03:02.394 - 01:03:48.560, Speaker A: So it's basically on chain financial products, which is also the same thing, and then insurance. Those are essentially the categories where I think adoption is going to happen soonest. I mean, you can see that from a lot of our announcements. And then there are a number of platforms like Openlaw and like others that are building interfaces where people construct the contract themselves. And then that's completely left to the success of those platforms. Right. It's kind of like if people go to that platform and they build a lot of contracts, and those contracts need market prices or something else, that's one of those things that can just come out of that field and be a huge success.
01:03:48.560 - 01:04:03.150, Speaker A: It's difficult to predict. So it's really in three categories. Derivatives, insurance, and then people building platforms where that need data. People can build various contracts. That was the last one.
01:04:03.220 - 01:04:04.302, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
01:04:04.436 - 01:04:48.606, Speaker A: So just one last thing first. I mean, I'd really like to thank Tom also. I mean, I think you guys have some slight clarity on what we're trying to do at Chainlink. We are growing our team, and we are looking for developers and a product manager. So if you folks have anybody who wants to get into blockchains and crypto and smart contracts with the team that's going to win, then I think they should talk to. You'd be doing them a favor, put it that way. Come back to you in a few years.
01:04:48.606 - 01:05:07.718, Speaker A: But thank you so much. If you'd like to talk to us now, I'm here. There's a few people from our team running the chain link shirt. If you're a developer or CTO, Steve, he's back there. You're welcome to chat with him. And this us, finer details if you'd like, and I'll be around as well. Thank you.
01:05:07.718 - 01:05:10.130, Speaker A: Thank you all very much. Bye.
