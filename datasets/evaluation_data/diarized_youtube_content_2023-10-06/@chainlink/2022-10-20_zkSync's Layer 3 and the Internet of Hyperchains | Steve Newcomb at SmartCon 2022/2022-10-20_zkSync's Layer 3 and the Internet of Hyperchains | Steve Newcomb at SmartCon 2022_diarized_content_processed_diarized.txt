00:00:10.170 - 00:00:13.280, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, thanks for coming to today's talk.
00:00:14.690 - 00:00:16.078, Speaker B: We're going to talk today a little.
00:00:16.084 - 00:00:43.402, Speaker A: Bit about layer two, but mostly about layer three. And it's an exciting time to talk about layer three. But what I want to do is perhaps capture some of the ten x moments that are going to be happening so you can kind of get that roadmap in your head, because we at ZK sync are the ones working on infinite scalability. And I want to kind of give you guys a little bit of insight into what we're seeing. One of the things that's really important.
00:00:43.536 - 00:00:45.066, Speaker B: To do is to have a bit.
00:00:45.088 - 00:01:14.046, Speaker A: Of a frame of mind in terms of these ten x moments. Because the success of technologies that affect billions of people, they don't happen smoothly. They tend to happen in fits and spurts in these ten x moments. And generally what they do is they happen either in the areas of performance, I. E. Scalability, trust, customization, cost ease and composability. And this isn't true for just us in crypto.
00:01:14.046 - 00:01:17.186, Speaker A: It has been true in the past, and I want to kind of give.
00:01:17.208 - 00:01:18.818, Speaker B: You a little bit of a walkthrough.
00:01:18.914 - 00:01:47.162, Speaker A: And an example where this has happened in the past, so we can kind of frame that as we think about what's going to be happening with Ethereum. So let's take you to 1995. There was about 25,000 websites in 1995. Internet speeds were around 10. We were at the moment where nobody trusted the Internet. Nobody said that they wanted to use their credit cards on the Internet. I remember people saying, oh, there's no real use cases for the Internet.
00:01:47.162 - 00:02:29.382, Speaker A: It's just going to be a fad and we're going to move on past this. Go fast forward ten years later. Average Internet speeds are now sitting around 1 mb. So scale has happened, ease of use has been impacted. We have things like Javascript to jQuery, to WordPress, so things got easier, things got more trusted. We saw SSL come along, we saw that little lock icon appear up in the browser, and suddenly everybody did trust the Internet with their credit cards. And then we finally get to 2005 where I was working on a project called Powerset that eventually became Microsoft Bing, the search engine, and we had to index the Internet.
00:02:29.382 - 00:03:46.310, Speaker A: And one of the things that I was astonished by is that we were looking at 60 billion websites when we had to index the Internet in 2005. So the lesson to learn here is when you have those ten x moments in technology, the impact or reaction from the ecosystem isn't just ten x. In many cases, it's 100 x, it's 1000 x in new use cases that we never thought of and the amount of users that we never thought of. So when thinking about Ethereum and scaling Ethereum, it's amazing. We only have about 3400 projects in the space right now, and our transactions per second, there's a lot of reports on this, we're averaging around 15 transactions per second. But what happens when we get transactions per second up into 100,000 tps or a million tpS? What will then be the ripple effect and reaction from the ecosystem in both use cases and users? Can you imagine a day in 2030 when that little lock icon in the top of your browser switches from a lock icon to an Ethereum icon? And that's what we're after at Matterlabs. Infinite scalability creates infinite use cases.
00:03:46.310 - 00:04:30.594, Speaker A: So Vitalik was on bankless earlier this week, and he gave us a really, really interesting and fascinating quote. He said, I don't think there's one vision for Ethereum, I think there's many. And it's scaling that unlocks all of those different visions and versions of Ethereum. And the other thing that Vitalik has said in the past is that at the end of the day, ZK roll ups will win and be the end game for scaling Ethereum. That's when we can replace the lock icon with the Ethereum icon. So a lot of folks are saying, well, like, well, tell me why? Why are ZK roll ups really the end game? And it's fascinating because it starts with.
00:04:30.632 - 00:04:32.866, Speaker B: Layer two, but the real place it.
00:04:32.888 - 00:04:48.454, Speaker A: Exists is in layer three. Layer two offers a single instance of a ten x moment. When we launch layer two ZK roll ups, we will be about ten x faster than Ethereum. We might grow that to 100 x at layer two.
00:04:48.652 - 00:04:53.034, Speaker B: But what I'll show you today is that layer three is a Starfield of.
00:04:53.072 - 00:05:48.822, Speaker A: Ten x moments across all six vectors of the things that matter and bring new use cases and new users. So let's just talk about layer two for a second. There is a lot of light being shown on ZK sync right now because we are 29 days away from launching the first EVM compatible ZK roll up out there that has the five magic ingredients that the ecosystem has been looking for. It is a generalized ZK roll up. It is EVM compatible, it is solidity compatible, it's open sourced, and we put the word decentralized up there. But I think a more important view on it is that the way we intend to decentralize and the way we intend to serve. Our tokenomics model is in alignment with the values and mission of Ethereum.
00:05:48.822 - 00:06:17.330, Speaker A: So this long awaited ZK roll up is 29 days away, and it's an exciting, exciting moment. We'll wait for you to answer the phone. Now here's my favorite tree of life slide to start describing what's going to be happening in layer three. Think of Ethereum. The next big ten x moment that I want you to put on your roadmap, put in your head, is EIP 4844.
00:06:17.480 - 00:06:18.726, Speaker B: There's a lot of stuff out there.
00:06:18.748 - 00:06:40.138, Speaker A: That says it's 100 x moment. I would urge you to maybe tamp your expectations down to maybe ten to 20 x moment. That's going to be huge, though. Then ZK roll ups launch. So ZK sync 20 is going to launch. We'll be another ten x on top of that. So we get 100 x and then we get into layer three.
00:06:40.138 - 00:07:30.102, Speaker A: And I want to talk about layer three. I described it as having a Starfield of ten x moments cutting across first scalability, but also the other ones. So security, usability, composability and customization. And so I want to walk you through how that plays out and how it works. How does the scaling work? Why has Vitalik Buterin said this is the one possible future that could be the end game? And how this is perhaps different than optimistic rollups, which a lot of people ask? So, first and foremost, infinite scalability and infinite customization are the two keywords, the two watchwords to think about when you're thinking about layer three. Number one, when you get up into layer three and you're building a fractal blockchain, we call it a hyperchain.
00:07:30.166 - 00:07:32.566, Speaker B: Up there, you'll have three structural choices.
00:07:32.598 - 00:08:07.746, Speaker A: When you build out your blockchain. And this is important because a DFI company, a gaming company, and all the different use cases are going to want to customize their blockchain for their own specific use case. So let me talk about that for a minute. You'll have three options. A ZK roll up, a ZK porter, and a validium. ZK roll ups will be ZK rollups recursing inside of ZK rollups to the base chain. This is what a DFI company would choose if it's trying to maximize its security, because you'll be able to inherit the security of Ethereum into that layer three solution.
00:08:07.746 - 00:08:10.962, Speaker A: A second solution you could choose is ZK Porter.
00:08:11.106 - 00:08:12.474, Speaker B: This is where you could split your.
00:08:12.512 - 00:08:45.038, Speaker A: Data and say, I want this data on Ethereum for max security, but this data, I want on a validium, because I want max performance. Imagine a gaming company where I'm saving my financial data onto Ethereum to protect it. But the fact that my sword of Elrond is green for me as a character, I can do that on a validium. And I want that to be super fast, super cheap. 100,000 transactions per second, million transactions per second. Or you can do a pure validium where everything is off chain and you're absolutely maxing out for million transactions per second, super low gas fees, and you're.
00:08:45.054 - 00:08:46.406, Speaker B: Willing to do that trade off of.
00:08:46.428 - 00:09:05.014, Speaker A: Having a little bit less security than Ethereum. Further, and this is a big one. When you are building out your fractal hyperchain in layer three, we will allow you to secure your hyperchain with your own token. We all remember when DyDX left starkware. It was a big moment for Ethereum.
00:09:05.062 - 00:09:06.582, Speaker B: We lost DyDX.
00:09:06.726 - 00:10:07.518, Speaker A: We can now bring DYDX back because they can decentralize and have their own token, yet be native on Ethereum, which is a very, very big moment for Ethereum. Second, you can choose that your fractal hyperchain can be private or public. And that topic right there is probably worth about a month of discussion, but that will be an option up there in layer three as well. And the last and most important feature set, and this is what really differentiates this method from optimistic, is regardless of how you customize your fractal hyperchain, how you're scaling it, you're getting infinite scalability, infinite customization. But what's amazing is no matter what you do up there, all of the fractal hyperchains in layer three are connected through the same circuit infrastructure. Why is that important? And this is huge for security. This is probably 100 x moment for security in layer three.
00:10:07.518 - 00:10:57.498, Speaker A: When we bring people onto layer three, there are no more bridges. That is where all the hack points are in non native bridges from when talking from one bridge or one blockchain to another, this is what's going to really change the game for security and trust. It's a ten x trust moment, and that's a huge impact for the ecosystem. So that's how layer three works. Now let me talk about some other types of ten x moments that could occur in one possible future of Ethereum. One of the amazing things that has happened out of this is we begun talking to ecosystem projects and saying we have realized there are new use cases that we maybe didn't even see when we started building out this technology. For example, all of the Alt L ones that are not Ethereum.
00:10:57.498 - 00:11:59.300, Speaker A: They want to have a close tie with Ethereum so that they can stay and live and breathe and be the ecosystem that they want to be. There is an amazing paradigm shift that could be happening in one of these possible futures where the Alt l ones become l three validiums and therefore get a native bridge to Ethereum, instead of dealing with a non native bridge to Ethereum. So that alone is probably worth talking about for a month. Further, imagine if the entire l two space gets together and standardizes on our prover, much like we standardize on Ethereum's EVM. So imagine now we have a standardized EVM and a standardized prover. Imagine a world in which all of the alt l two s can also come in in this system and be a validium on Zksync's l three. And so this world where we used to talk about saying it's a winner take all or winner take most system doesn't have to be true.
00:11:59.300 - 00:12:49.714, Speaker A: We at ZK sync, our primary mission is to scale the values and technology of Ethereum. We are not here to compete and kill our competitors in the l two space, nor are we here to compete and kill companies in the l one space. We are here to provide a solution that perhaps can provide an alternate future, an alternate option that's possible where these communities, like, say, you are a big believer in optimism and the values that it portrays. It does great work in governance, it does great work in public goods work. Imagine a world in which we can have a native link between optimism and Zk sync. If optimism is something like a layer three validium, and this is only one possible future that I'm describing with this technology. The importance here is that this is.
00:12:49.752 - 00:12:52.434, Speaker B: So broad, this is so adaptive, there.
00:12:52.472 - 00:13:09.226, Speaker A: Could be other possible futures in here as well, all of which are aimed at supporting Ethereum's values and Ethereum's technology. And that's sort of the magic of this. And I have more slides, but I really wanted to just leave it on this slide just so that we can.
00:13:09.248 - 00:13:12.486, Speaker B: All absorb, like, this is why ZK.
00:13:12.518 - 00:13:17.500, Speaker A: Rollups are the end game and other approaches are not the end game.
00:13:18.510 - 00:13:20.186, Speaker B: If you would like to see a.
00:13:20.208 - 00:13:30.606, Speaker A: Much more detailed explanation of this and a very much longer discussion about this, I just did an hour and a half with David and Ryan with bankless that we just posted on Tuesday that.
00:13:30.628 - 00:13:32.494, Speaker B: You please feel free to watch.
00:13:32.612 - 00:13:53.762, Speaker A: It's a very, very good episode that describes this in much more detail than we have time today. And additionally, we are launching our l two solution in 29 days. And one of the things that's going to be a fascinating realization is that l three will come much faster than l two took to come to the table.
00:13:53.906 - 00:13:55.606, Speaker B: It took us four years to build.
00:13:55.628 - 00:14:15.614, Speaker A: The first evm Zk roll up. It will take us much less time to be able to announce to you it's not going to happen today, but very soon to launch, that we will have l three on testnet already. And the beauty is, once you are adapted onto the Zk bus, once you get on the bus, you get l.
00:14:15.652 - 00:14:17.306, Speaker B: Three for free because we are dead.
00:14:17.338 - 00:14:34.418, Speaker A: Equivalents to our l three solution. So with that being said, if you guys want to follow along and follow the updates to this, join our testnet, sign up to join and port over to zksync so you can join the bus. And if you want to watch the detailed look, go over to bankless and.
00:14:34.424 - 00:14:35.522, Speaker B: Take a look at that.
00:14:35.656 - 00:15:00.734, Speaker A: And as well if you want to talk to me in person, or our co founder that invented it all, who's sitting right there? Alex, we're throwing the big ice cream party tonight. I think we already have like 900 people signed up, so please come to that. Please talk to us in person.
