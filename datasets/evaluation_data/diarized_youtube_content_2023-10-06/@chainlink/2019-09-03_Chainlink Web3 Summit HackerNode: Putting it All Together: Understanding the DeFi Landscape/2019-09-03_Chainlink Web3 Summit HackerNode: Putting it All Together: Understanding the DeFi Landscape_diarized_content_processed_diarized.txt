00:00:07.720 - 00:00:47.592, Speaker A: I'm going to make a brief presentation that's kind of like an overview of the entire DeFi lending ecosystem. A lot of people found this helpful. Finance included it in their DeFi report. And maybe some of you have already kind of read this already been passed around by a lot of teams, Keith and Zerox and Citibank and a lot of people. But I'm going to present it here, hopefully for you. It's not a rehash. I'm just going to kind of set out a framework for understanding the DeFi lending space and how all the projects kind of approach the different problems.
00:00:47.592 - 00:01:26.352, Speaker A: I'm going to break down each component of those protocols and kind of put it on a spectrum for everyone. So framework for classifying DeFi lending protocols. So over here, you have completely centralized lending platforms. You got salt, Celsius, Nexus, blockfi. As you work your way down, you get dorma yuo expo, which has been sunset. That was project by Dydx Eastlen compound maker Dydx. Our products, fulcrum and BZX.
00:01:26.352 - 00:02:16.144, Speaker A: At the end, we were incentivized to create this and talk about it because we did go through a lot of pain to decentralize. So it's not a coincidence that we're talking about it and we happen to be quite decentralized. So there's a number of different components. You have custody, you have the price fee, you have the margin call. You have where the margin call liquidity is coming from. You have how the interest rates are determined, and you have, of course, how the platform is developed. Is it developed centrally by a company? Is there centralized control over a wallet that can modify codes, all of that? So as I mentioned, salt, Blockfly, Nexo, Celsius, they're all completely centralized.
00:02:16.144 - 00:02:53.040, Speaker A: So like traditional companies, all of that. And then you have Dharma. So Dharma is pretty interesting. They recently kind of closed down a little bit, but their general system was that they were noncustodial. They have a watcher contract that you submit your transaction to them. They have a watcher contract that watch your contract forwards your funds into their main smart contract. And they centrally handle the liquidations.
00:02:53.040 - 00:03:49.890, Speaker A: They centrally handle the price feed. They source all the liquidity. Recently, they've been trying to decentralize more, and they've been working more towards the Makerdao liquidation model. The ecosystem, in a general sense, has been kind of converging on the Makerdao liquidation system. So you look at UIDX, compound, dharma, makerdao obviously have all kind of been converging on this sort of model where you have centralized price feeds and then you have people come in and bring liquidity. Dharma has a particularly centralized version of this dharma out online right now. They're retooling and probably going to come out with something different pretty soon.
00:03:49.890 - 00:04:32.940, Speaker A: Tier two, you have duo, you have YDX's expo, which has been sunset. You have Eclen Aabe as you might know it in other circles. Eclend has recently been retooling to have lending pools, to have both fixed interest rate loans and variable interest rate loans. They're moving towards compound automated market maker model. And you got nuo. So to just explain a little bit about nuo, how newell works, they're non custodial. They have margin calls that only they can initiate.
00:04:32.940 - 00:05:06.200, Speaker A: So it's whitelisted. That can potentially cause issues compared to community liquidation models because they're one address trying to do it. They're not too high. They don't have multiple wallets. This has led to at times newo failing to liquidate in time and lenders suffering losses. Their margin call liquidity comes from Kyber. Their price feed comes mostly from Kyber, but they also pull from binance coinbase.
00:05:06.200 - 00:05:55.160, Speaker A: Their interest rates is basically industry standard at this point, algorithmic. When they pull kind of like compound like ByDX, like Fulcrum, and Nuo centrally develops their contract expo. It's been sunset. They did dutch auctions in order to liquidate. This turned out to be not a great idea because they would get slippage of like 20%. They would kind of centrally do it, go to radar relay and do it over the course of hours so they could expose the lenders to a lot of risk. They didn't have any price fees because it was a dutch auction.
00:05:55.160 - 00:06:21.910, Speaker A: And the interest rates, they were just like checked. They're like, hey, you get 5% for this, you might get 8% for this. Didn't move around or anything like that. And of course CyDx controlled it with Ethland. So Ethland kind of like puts it in the hands of the lender. So this was how it originally was. They're moving towards a more compound ish model.
00:06:21.910 - 00:07:10.204, Speaker A: But they had some UX issues where lenders would lend out and they would have to make the margin calls themselves, they would have to monitor the positions themselves. And this is not a very favorable user experience for people. So the lender also had to provide the liquidity, so they incurred capital carrying costs. East lend also took a fee on top of that from the trader. The interest rates were completely market driven. Both the lender and the trader kind of negotiate that sort of order book style. And of course equin centrally develops these contracts.
00:07:10.204 - 00:07:59.280, Speaker A: So like degree three, we have compound and makerdao. There's a lot in common people call compound, kind of like the early multicolateral die, of course, so lets you get a lot of that functionality. But they use these algorithmic automated market maker lending pools. So like with compound, it's non custodial. Anyone can initiate a margin call, anyone can bring margin call. Liquidity in compound has their own price feed that they centrally administer via a smart contract. That smart contract has a sensitivity parameter which prevents compound from moving it around too much within a given time period.
00:07:59.280 - 00:08:36.616, Speaker A: The interest rates are set by their interest rate model. So they set the parameters centrally and presumably target some kind of utilization. Their development is of course centralized. Makerdao has some similarities to compound. So anybody can initiate a margin call with makerdao, the liquidity, anybody can bring it in. The pricing makerdao kind of has like this sort of consortium. It's kind of decentralized, but also not really completely decentralized.
00:08:36.616 - 00:09:35.244, Speaker A: Their price fees are decentralized in the same sense that EOS is decentralized. Maybe a lot of you don't feel like EOS is decentralized, but they have 14 people or so that are closely related who know each other for setting the prices. And this does provide some. It's better than one person, right? It's just like, it's better than EOS is better than 16 people or whatever they have are block producers rather than just like one person who essentially administers the database. Their interest rates are set by governance, so they have the maker token holders set what the stability fees are. Again, in our framework here, we consider this kind of on the border of decentralized. It's not market driven.
00:09:35.244 - 00:10:18.456, Speaker A: So truly decentralized interest rates would be like lenders, borrowers kind of meeting in the middle and figuring out like, okay, here's what I'm willing to pay. In an order book model, this is more centrally said. It doesn't always hit the market clearing rate. It's sort of like autonomous, so to speak. They're trying to, through trial and error, like a hill climbing algorithm, reach that market clearing rate up and down. And of course Makerdao is centrally developed, but it's open source as well. Degree four, D five, you got DyDx and Fulcrum.
00:10:18.456 - 00:10:51.048, Speaker A: So ByDX, they released a new version of this system where it's very different. It's more towards the compat model, more towards that automated market maker model. You got Fulcrum. That's what we did. And that Fulcrum model is also automated market maker. There's a lot of similarities to BYDX, but we're not a money market. There are some differences, too.
00:10:51.048 - 00:11:10.460, Speaker A: It's more general, and we'll kind of get into. I'll start with DyDX. So, DyDx right now is focusing just on e die. It's non custodial. Anybody can initiate that margin call. Anyone can bring that liquidity. They're basically doing it like compound, basically doing it like makerdao.
00:11:10.460 - 00:11:54.750, Speaker A: They're using compounds like 5% discount on collateral. They use centralized price feed. So right now, they're kind of going off of makerdao price feed. They're using the east to die price feed. So they're also using that interest rate model that compound is using, where they kind of centrally set the parameters. One difference from compound is that Bydx uses a polynomial for their interest rate model, whereas compound uses linear formula Y equals an x plus b. And of course, the development of Bydx was done by them.
00:11:54.750 - 00:12:32.888, Speaker A: We, of course, hope that it will become decentralized. But every single thing I've mentioned so far is centrally developed by the companies behind me. And no protocol so far has been developed in a completely decentralized way. So, to go back a little bit, fulcrum, that's what we do. So one of the differences between Fulcrum and Dydx is that Fulcrum is more general. So Fulcrum doesn't just do ethi, it also does all kinds of ERC 20. Anybody can make a margin call.
00:12:32.888 - 00:13:05.268, Speaker A: Anyone can bring margin call. Liquidity in. The price fee is from hybrid network, which is basically, if you're not familiar with hybrid network, there's a whole bunch of reserve managers that sort of compete in order to provide the best price. And so this is really great and decentralized way to get prices that's robust and secure. The interest rates, they are, again, just like compound, just like Bydx. They're essentially set. There's an interest rate model.
00:13:05.268 - 00:13:52.924, Speaker A: Ours is a little bit different from Dydx and compound in that we have that linear model up to about 90%, and then we have a discontinuity, and then it very sharply rises after 90%. And this is so that the lending utilization of the pool never reaches 100%, so that people who are already in can always get out. We think this is pretty reasonable. DydX is doing something kind of similar with their polynomial, but not quite the same development. Again, as with everything else. Like everybody essentially developing these products protocols, they have control over it. So the last one is BZx.
00:13:52.924 - 00:14:35.116, Speaker A: So that's the underlying protocol that Fulfill runs on. That's something built, went on mainnet like last year in September. It just powers bamboo relay, which is zero x relay. It is going to be powering Ethernet's margin trading. So they've kind of moved on to rebranded to diversify, and that is a zero X relay, but it's also going to be a BZX relay. It's going to have these order books and all that. Right now, diversify is integrating Fulcrum's margin tokens.
00:14:35.116 - 00:15:18.016, Speaker A: So Fulcrum has itokens that are kind of like c tokens that steadily accrue interest. And they also have p tokens which are like two times e, three times eth, all of that. So those can be listed on exchanges, whether that's psex or centralized exchanges. Diversify is going to be one of the first exchanges that lists those P tokens, those position tokens, as we call them. So BBX is the most decentralized of all these protocols. We were, of course, incentivized to write this article and all of that because we put a lot of time into decentralizing it. And it was something that was very important to us, very important.
00:15:18.016 - 00:15:52.964, Speaker A: Something we put a lot of thought into, a lot of love into, actually. So the custody of custodial, like pretty much all of the Defi protocols, it's sort of like the baseline. Anything that Defi needs to be, at the very least, non custodial. Anyone can initiate a margin call. The margin of the call liquidity comes from Kyber, which is decentralized. Anybody can enable a token allowance to a Kyber reserve, or they could become a reserve manager. Price fees, again, comes from Kyber.
00:15:52.964 - 00:16:31.972, Speaker A: The interest rates, they're market driven. So done by an order book. So if you know, like Bitfinex, the Kraken, or any of those centralized margin trading platforms, what you have is you have lenders, you have traders, and they have pretty tight spreads, and they are putting their bids and asks on that order book. There's a lot of benefits to that. First of all, it's completely decentralized, it's completely market driven. The spreads are tight, no matter the market regime. With automatic market makers like compile, like the Wedx, like Fulcrum, you get pretty wide spreads most of the time.
00:16:31.972 - 00:17:02.524, Speaker A: There's like three, four, sometimes 5% spreads. And sometimes even more. And that's not really efficient. What you want to see is tight spreads. That's what you want to see in an efficient market. But if you have just static parameters of your interest rate model, you're going to get these tight spreads under very limited, very limited circumstances, very limited market regimes. Whereas with order books you can always get these tight spreads.
00:17:02.524 - 00:17:50.592, Speaker A: If you look at these centralized platforms for margin trading, they always have tight spreads because it's market driven and it's an order book. And of course, development as usual, is centrally driven, centrally controlled, all of that. And that's the whole presentation. It's on medium. A lot of people have read it. You might have already came across this article kind of rehash, but it's interesting to think about in the context of Chainlink that a lot of the centralization that's happening in terms of these deFi protocols comes from the price feeds. So decentralizing the price feeds is a really urgent and important thing.
00:17:50.592 - 00:18:39.772, Speaker A: Get power out of the hands of the protocols themselves. Compound recently announced an initiative for these open price fees that anybody can contribute to. Unfortunately they're not incentivized, so somewhat doubtful that it will gain any significant adoption. Could be centralized exchanges use them to boost up vanity metrics. Probably appropriate to shout out that Sandy Kuluchov of Eastland's Ajbe first proposed the idea to Robert Lesnar and kind of made it more public, made it more popular. I think this open Christ feed initiative was only announced like a day or two ago. So that is kind of the totality of the talk.
00:18:39.772 - 00:18:43.130, Speaker A: And if anybody has any questions, now's the time to ask.
