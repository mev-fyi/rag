00:00:00.330 - 00:00:56.160, Speaker A: You, how does chain link fit into making DFI what it is today? Sure, of course. So depending on the day, we power between anywhere from 60% to 80% of DFI that needs oracles. That's similar to the type of numbers you see around Linux and other open source standards. Chainlink is a global open source standard for generating all of these services. And there are already hundreds of these services that have been generated. It secures tens of billions of dollars, it secures a very sizable percentage of DeFI, and it is the primary mechanism through which a lot of data now starting with Chainlink keeper, is a lot of off chain computation that needs to be trust minimized is being delivered, as well as with CCIP, the delivery of various cross chain movements and commands. So what Chainlink does is it creates an expanding framework for creating all of these off chain services, decentralized services.
00:00:56.160 - 00:01:39.460, Speaker A: And when we think about decentralized services, we just need to remember that there is a universe of APIs and there's a universe of other systems and services that have data and that have payment capabilities and that have a whole bunch of stuff out there in the world, but they are unusable by a smart contract until you put them into the chainlink format. And so the goal of Chainlink is quite simply to be the global standard for generating all of these off chain services for data trust, minimized off chain computation to expand what contracts can do, and the delivery of cross chain communication across multiple different chains, actually expanding the definition of what a smart contract is.
