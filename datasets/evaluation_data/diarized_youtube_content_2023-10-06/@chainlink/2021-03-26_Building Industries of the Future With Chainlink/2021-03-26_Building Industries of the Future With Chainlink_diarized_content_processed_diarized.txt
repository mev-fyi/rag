00:00:02.010 - 00:01:16.020, Speaker A: I think the thing I'm really here to tell you is that the limitations that were in this space even a year ago about making decentralized financial products, making events driven contracts, making scalable smart contract code, a lot of these limitations are falling away and I think the people that take advantage of this new environment allows them to build new truly useful things will be the people that come to build the use cases which redefine our industry. And I think you are those people. I am the person that works pretty much almost all the time to bring these capabilities to you and you are the extremely talented people who are going to take those capabilities and I personally believe are going to redefine the space once again by building the use cases which truly come to take us from blockchains are about those token things to blockchains are the dominant form of digital agreement that powers the global financial industry, the global trade finance industry, the global insurance industry in a way that trickles down and benefits the average person.
