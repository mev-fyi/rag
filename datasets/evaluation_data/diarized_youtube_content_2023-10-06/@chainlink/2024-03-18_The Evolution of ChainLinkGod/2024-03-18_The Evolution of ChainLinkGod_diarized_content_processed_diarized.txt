00:00:00.330 - 00:00:35.350, Speaker A: You. My name is Zach Rimes. Though you may know me as Chainlink God on Twitter, you might be surprised to learn that I'm not in fact a green frog, but simply someone who enjoys educating the world about how crypto can improve society. I originally stumbled upon Chainlink in early 2018, but it soon became clear there was this knowledge gap within the broader crypto community. Oracles were a novel constant, and their full potential understood by few. There was a clear need for someone to serve as community resource, breaking down technical concepts. And that's when the CLG account was born.
00:00:35.350 - 00:01:30.390, Speaker A: Over the years, the Chainlink community has grown by orders of magnitude, composed of people all around the world with a diversity of backgrounds. It's been amazing to see, and yet there's still so many people left to onboard. Now, in 2024, I see our industry as being better positioned than ever before, and the chainlink ecosystem has scaled significantly. Chainlink is no longer a niche tool for price feeds, but is now a standard, powering the largest DeFi applications and onboarding some of the largest financial institutions on chain. So given this evolution of Chainlink, I felt it was only natural for the CLG identity to also evolve. Pseudonyms within crypto are common, but for me personally, I see an opportunity to scale my voice through in person events and podcasts, and in effect, help educate this new wave of entrants joining our industry. I look forward to meeting many more people in the community and continuing to educate the whole world about what our industry is trying to build.
00:01:30.390 - 00:01:32.680, Speaker A: This excites me. It does.
