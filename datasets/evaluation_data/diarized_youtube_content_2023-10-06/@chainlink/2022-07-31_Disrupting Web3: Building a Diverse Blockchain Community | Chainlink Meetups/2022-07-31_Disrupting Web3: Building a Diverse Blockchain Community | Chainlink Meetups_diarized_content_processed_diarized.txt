00:00:31.810 - 00:00:50.800, Speaker A: Okay, well, welcome to Chain links Woman disrupting web3 event. So we have a wonderful group of panelists and oh, my God, we're extending to the other side of the room. So that's really awesome to have that many women join us.
00:00:51.250 - 00:00:52.654, Speaker B: Okay, so I guess I will start.
00:00:52.692 - 00:01:32.218, Speaker A: With saying that the ethos of web3 is all about equality for all. So as we build the future of technology, we are looking for fairness and inclusion. So with me tonight, we have lots of women representing crypto and blockchain. So they're representing both community and businesses. So I'm going to actually let all of them probably say the best story that they can about themselves because I know I couldn't. And I wouldn't want to highlight the wrong things about them because obviously I want to let them do that.
00:01:32.384 - 00:01:32.858, Speaker B: Okay.
00:01:32.944 - 00:01:36.954, Speaker A: All right, maybe, yeah, I'm going to let you speak.
00:01:36.992 - 00:01:37.530, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:01:37.600 - 00:01:58.738, Speaker C: Thanks, Agnes. Hi, everyone. I'm a young Jen. I lead the developer and community relations team at near foundation. I'm actually pretty new to crypto and the blockchain space. I'm about a year in, I would say, and I'm also pretty new to Nier. I'm about two months in now, but I'm really excited about the space, obviously.
00:01:58.738 - 00:02:07.480, Speaker C: Really honored to be up here with these fabulous panelists and so, yeah, thank you all for coming. Excited to be chatting today.
00:02:11.370 - 00:02:44.450, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. My name is Yuvia. I'm a general partner at Crust Network. So I was basically hired to take over the marketing for our US branch. And I'm also a bit new to Crest Network, also two months in and also about a year and a half into the crypto space. I previously worked at a sister company to our competitor, which is a little funny fact about me and yeah, so I'm mostly on the marketing side and I specialize in content marketing.
00:02:45.830 - 00:02:57.780, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Marcella Cage. I am the organizer for Crypto Monday San Francisco. We have 77 chapters around the globe and I run the San Francisco one and I've been in the space for about four years.
00:03:00.950 - 00:03:29.470, Speaker B: Hi, everyone, my name is LV. Really excited to be here. Thank you for having me. I'm actually at Chinlink, but ended up being invited here to speak yesterday. So really excited to be here along with you all. And thank you all for coming. So I work on strategy, ecosystem strategy and growth at chain link Labs, and I've been in the space since about 2017 ish.
00:03:29.470 - 00:03:45.860, Speaker B: And really to your question about what's exciting, really exciting to see all the development that's been happening since years ago and how far we've come, and very excited to see where we're going from here. So good to see everyone.
00:03:47.510 - 00:04:14.426, Speaker F: Hey, everybody. My name is Alejandra. I am one of the co founders at Crypto Babes club. We started in 2020. I don't know if anybody remembers clubhouse days. We were, like, one of the first female groups on crypto and Clubhouse, and then, you know, what happened to clubhouse, right? But we moved, and this is something I'm really proud about. We realized that we needed in real life connections, and we started to do a lot of in real life experiences.
00:04:14.426 - 00:04:42.020, Speaker F: We host events, we host workshops online. We do a lot of relationship building. And we just did an event for bitcoin Miami. We did one for Austin, Texas. We're going to be in Toronto as well. So we're mostly focusing in Canada and the US, and we're getting our presence back up online, but we really do want to focus on creating connections for women in the space and just building. So, yeah, super excited to be here.
00:04:44.730 - 00:05:09.470, Speaker A: All right, thank you. And I still haven't even introduced myself, so my name is Agnes Predhan. I'm with Chainlink, and my regular role is a developer marketing program manager. So please give these ladies a round of applause. Welcome. Now that you know a little bit. Okay.
00:05:09.470 - 00:05:14.260, Speaker A: All right. Well, then I say, let's get this started.
00:05:14.710 - 00:05:16.020, Speaker B: Some easy questions.
00:05:16.550 - 00:05:38.700, Speaker A: What inspires you ladies, and why? I think that's the main one. We can also talk about how you balance work and life responsibilities, but I guess I'm more interested in hearing about what are your inspirations and why.
00:05:40.430 - 00:06:08.910, Speaker F: I'll start, if anybody doesn't mind. So what really inspires me. So, one of the core goals at crypto babes, we want to get more women hired. And I can speak from my own experience. I actually got hired because of crypto babes, which sounds OD, but I went to school. If you look at a lot of statistics, a lot of women are not going to school for stem, although there is a good amount. I went to college to be a teacher.
00:06:08.910 - 00:06:31.080, Speaker F: Right then I realized I had some visa issues and I couldn't teach, but I think that was a blessing. I graduated college. I couldn't work a regular job, so crypto gave me the opportunity to create my own job. So I started doing consulting, freelancing. I always had a passion for talking to people. I'm a very talkative person. I enjoy posting reels on Instagram and doing stuff like that.
00:06:31.080 - 00:07:02.418, Speaker F: And then I met my co founder, actually, on Instagram, and we connected really well, we said, hey, we want to create. And at the time, I remember going to crypto events and I would show up and it was like, a lot of guys that were like developers. And I'm like, well, I don't know how to code. I know about crypto, but I feel super intimidated, like, talking to them because I didn't feel like I could even get a job in crypto. That's how I felt back then. A couple of years back. And when I met my co founder, we realized, okay, we need to teach women.
00:07:02.418 - 00:07:36.026, Speaker F: How can they improve their resumes? How can they really get hired? Because something that I noticed, women can be humble. Like, when we speak about our achievements, even when people ask me about crypto babes, I'm like, we're just a community of women, but we're 25,000 women and men, right? It's not just women. But that grew online, and now we're doing a lot of events that we're hosting 200 people. Our event in Canada is going to be 400 people. So we're super proud about that. But we also do a lot of education. That really inspires me to know that we're making a difference.
00:07:36.026 - 00:07:58.182, Speaker F: And once in a while, I am, like, going to events and people are like, oh, my God, I remember you. You were like, the first. Not too long ago, I went to an event and this girl come up to me, he's like, hey, I actually got into crypto because of you guys in 2020, and now I'm an NFD artist. And those moments make me so happy because it's like something that money can't buy. Just the feeling that you did something.
00:07:58.236 - 00:08:02.082, Speaker A: Good to the world, that's great impact.
00:08:02.226 - 00:08:02.920, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:03.930 - 00:08:05.030, Speaker A: Elvie.
00:08:07.950 - 00:09:24.020, Speaker B: So I think, to me, and that was very inspirational. Thank you for sharing. I think seeing so many people just working so hard in improving the space and supporting each other, I think that really inspires me a lot. I think crypto and blockchain is the industry that has one of the highest levels of support and helping each other kind of mentality, where it's not about competing with each other, it's about building an industry together. And that really is something different from anything I've used to seen before. And I think that also sets up a new kind of ethos for what the business, what the work, what the industry, employment could look like, where we're really coming from a perspective of, let's build something better together for a better future for ourselves and also generations to come. So, yeah, I'd say that.
00:09:25.270 - 00:09:57.980, Speaker E: So what inspires me is knowing that we are still so early. If you look at the s adoption curve of cryptocurrency, we're just right above early adoption. Right. And if you look at the late 1970s, we had high unemployment, and meanwhile you had Steve Jobs, who was building Apple, and you look at 2008 and we had a recession. Meanwhile you had Satoshi Nakamoto building bitcoin, and now the markets are down. And this is really, it's the time to learn, it's the time to build. And I think great things can come out of this time.
00:09:59.790 - 00:10:14.980, Speaker A: That's a very positive way to look at it. I mean, right now, like hard times economy, but knowing or seeing what other people have done when times were tough is something we should all remember and what we're individually capable of.
00:10:17.750 - 00:11:12.130, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree with everything you guys said. Something that inspires me about this industry is that I feel like because a lot of it's online and you can be totally anon in a way, people don't care as much about what your background is and you can just feel free to do what you want and go for the opportunities that you want. I know so many people that they weren't getting any job opportunities in web two. And when they moved to web3, they started making a ton of money. But it's not just about the money, it's about having confidence in yourself. And for me, when I was applying to web two companies, I dyed my hair black because I was like, oh, I used to have purple hair, okay? So I dyed my hair black because I was like, I'm never going to get a job with purple hair. And then when I got my job at crust network, they were like, oh, you should dye your hair green or something.
00:11:12.130 - 00:11:21.000, Speaker D: That would be really crazy. So I really like the culture of Web three and how everything's about being yourself.
00:11:23.530 - 00:12:37.950, Speaker C: I think for me, kind of to Marcella's point, I think the sheer possibilities and the potential of this technology and of all of the people who are in the space, but also the people who haven't gotten into the space, like just the sheer number of things that we haven't even tapped into, I think that's really inspiring. There's just so many possibilities and we're so early, like, to what you were saying, I think there's also the aspect of just like the people in the space, very much like, maybe it is because we're early, but there are so many people who are just so passionate and generous with their time and knowledge and especially being someone who's fairly new to the space. For the first few months, I was literally just going around asking people, and no one ever was like, oh, I'm sorry, I don't have time. They would literally sit with me and just explain anything that I had questions on, and that's really hard to find nowadays. I think a lot of people are so caught up in how busy they are and everything that they're working on. And so the fact that these nearly strangers were willing to share their time and energy with me, I think it's just really inspiring right now, just the amount of passion and the possibilities.
00:12:40.690 - 00:12:56.600, Speaker A: Okay, thank you, everyone so far. We'll move on to the next question. So looking back at your hard work and accomplishments, how have you built confidence and tenacity throughout your career to achieve such success?
00:12:57.610 - 00:13:35.220, Speaker C: I can start this time for me, I deal with crippling impostor syndrome every minute of my life, and so I don't think I feel like I've accomplished that much. But there are moments, those little glimmering moments where I'm able to help someone or they have a question and I'm able to answer it. And I think those are the moments when I'm just like, I was useful. But, yeah, I don't know if I would say I've made it or successes. I think those are still things that I aspire to.
00:13:37.270 - 00:13:44.126, Speaker A: Just one quick comment. Does anyone not have impostor syndrome? You can talk to us about it afterwards.
00:13:44.318 - 00:13:44.722, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:44.776 - 00:13:48.040, Speaker A: All right, one person. Great guy in the back.
00:13:49.770 - 00:14:00.540, Speaker E: I actually have a great joke for you. Where do men get their water from? A well, actually. And it's my favorite joke to make. Whenever someone mansplains to me.
00:14:03.870 - 00:14:05.100, Speaker G: Oh, my God.
00:14:08.190 - 00:14:08.940, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:13.730 - 00:14:48.390, Speaker D: Okay, I can go. Yeah, I totally agree. Especially when I was first getting into the space, I felt like, huge impostor syndrome. Especially because I'm also not a developer. I'm on the marketing side. So I actually remember I posted this Snapchat a while ago that was like, you never realize how dumb you are until you're surrounded by tech bros. I got really shy in the beginning because I had to learn so much, especially at crust.
00:14:48.390 - 00:15:14.480, Speaker D: Our product is really complex because it's all about IPFs and distributed networks and all this stuff. So, yeah, it was kind of a lot. But I think what helps me is my friends, like, surrounding yourself with people that are going to hype you up all the time. Because for me, I have this tendency. I don't want to brag about anything. I do. I don't want to tell people what I do either.
00:15:14.480 - 00:15:28.740, Speaker D: But then my friends, I'll be with my friends, and then they'll be like, no, she did this and she did that. She's not saying enough about herself. That really hypes me up and empowers me. I feel like. So, yeah, I think it's about surrounding yourself with the right people.
00:15:29.830 - 00:15:52.478, Speaker E: So I always say that whatever skills you have can be applied into a web3 setting. For example, I have no technical skills whatsoever. If you ask me to code, I can give you zero, nothing. But, for example, I'm a good network builder. And so I have a telegram, and there's over 630 people in there, and that's my skill that I bring to this space. The other thing is to know that, be humble. You don't know everything.
00:15:52.478 - 00:15:55.546, Speaker E: And if somebody says that they know everything, they don't.
00:15:55.578 - 00:15:55.774, Speaker F: Right.
00:15:55.812 - 00:16:09.730, Speaker E: They might have a lot of knowledge about cryptocurrencies or something, but they don't know everything. So everyone is learning, and that's the mindset I keep. I've always listened to podcasts and try to learn new things that might not be in my area of expertise.
00:16:12.630 - 00:16:17.620, Speaker B: Yeah. So the question was, how did you.
00:16:19.030 - 00:16:24.040, Speaker A: More tenacity and confidence over time, you've had your success, and.
00:16:26.570 - 00:16:27.206, Speaker F: What have you.
00:16:27.228 - 00:16:38.202, Speaker A: Done that kind of convinced you to have the confidence and maybe what kind of keeps you excited about and motivated about pursuing things?
00:16:38.336 - 00:17:17.742, Speaker B: Yeah. Also, quick question. How many people here are actually in crypto industry right now? In crypto industry, like now, and how many people are not yet or not? Okay. Yeah, that's great. So, for me, I think confidence comes from just keep doing what you're doing and start seeing results. I don't think confidence can come because you keep thinking, I'm confident, I'm confident. I'm confident.
00:17:17.742 - 00:18:05.160, Speaker B: That's not how it works. I used to think that could be the solution, by the way. I think confidence comes when you just doing what you're doing. Hopefully, you're being very passionate about it, so you're really putting 100% of all your effort into that and your time and really working, and then you start seeing results, and then the results kind of being a reflection to you that, hey, maybe I am doing well, and maybe I do deserve to think of myself, that I know stuff. So I think, to me, it's about just doing work and then start seeing results, and then your confidence will grow from there.
00:18:07.770 - 00:18:33.758, Speaker F: Yeah. I think, for me, is celebrating the small wins that happen every day. That's something that makes me really happy. Even looking back sometimes, I just talk to one person, something that I'm super happy to do with crypto babes. I get to meet so many women and men. I get to meet so many people from all parts of the world doing so many amazing things. And sometimes you just meet that one person that you're like, wow, I can work with this person or I can do this with this person.
00:18:33.758 - 00:19:21.118, Speaker F: And that's a small win because you just built your network. That means you just built your net worth as well, right? So not only celebrating those small wins, but putting new challenges into me, right? I always ask myself, who do I want to partner with next? Right? With crypto babies, we're all about bringing new projects, bringing education, right? At one point I wanted to bring near, we just recently worked with near in Austin, right? And now I'm like, okay, I want to work with another project. Let me go look for them, right? I'll send them a LinkedIn message. If they ghost me, which happens, I'm like, okay, where are they located? Maybe I'll just show up to their events and they won't ignore me. Right? Which is the other point that I like to do. Kind of like Marcella, I'm a community builder. I like to talk to people and knowing what your skill set is, and even in my background, I'm also in security.
00:19:21.118 - 00:19:59.562, Speaker F: So I mix a good mix of technical, non technical. A lot of my everyday is like writing what the developer does do in the team. I write it in terms that can be understood by the regular people. So that's my superpower. I'm able to make things that are complex, make it easier. So if you're somebody that doesn't code, you can make those things happen. And there's so much value, because if you're really advanced in crypto, if you're a developer and you can ask them the simplest question, they'll give you like a whole explanation for 30 minutes.
00:19:59.562 - 00:20:12.480, Speaker F: And you're like, okay. And sometimes they're just like, overcomplicate yourself. And I'm all about, let's just make it simple. So confidence, celebrating the small wins is something that works for me every time.
00:20:16.780 - 00:20:22.248, Speaker A: Okay, thank you, everyone, for sharing that. Okay, let's move on to our next question.
00:20:22.334 - 00:20:22.680, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:22.750 - 00:20:50.530, Speaker A: Whether for enterprise decentralized finance, NFTs, dows, or our ever growing web3 industry, or, sorry, our ever growing web3 industry continues to create new avenues of fairness and equality for all. So I wanted to know, what are your favorite tools, resources, or decentralized applications that you're using right now?
00:20:51.620 - 00:20:53.620, Speaker E: I can start. We'll start in the middle this time.
00:20:53.690 - 00:20:54.260, Speaker F: Yes.
00:20:54.410 - 00:21:21.500, Speaker E: I'm actually part of a couple of DAOs, and for those who don't know, decentralized, autonomous organizations. And we are raising funds through choice Dao for reproductive health organizations. I come from traditional philanthropy, where we get our funds from an endowment. So this is a new way of raising funds and also building a community that then decides where the funds are distributed to. And I think that's a beautiful use case for the future of organizations in philanthropy.
00:21:24.720 - 00:21:25.470, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:28.000 - 00:22:32.210, Speaker B: Actually, have you guys heard about the program called Startup with Chainlink? So, startup with Chainlink is an initiative that was launched fairly recently at the company where the founders, the people that are building initiatives or projects, come together as a community. And we do have AMA sessions, webinars answering questions, what jurisdiction to launch your company or how to build a good community. Go to her for that. So it's a great initiative to really step in, into the blockchain space as the founder or as the builder, as someone who wants to start an initiative or project. And we do have a lot of women and men there, so I highly encourage you guys to check it out. It's a great program. And, yeah, let me know if you guys have any questions about that, too.
00:22:32.820 - 00:22:58.872, Speaker F: There's two applications that I really like. One is coordinate. I'm sure some of you, if you're in a dao or working in crypto, you might be familiar with coordinate. What basically does, and what I really like about it is that people can, let's say, especially if you're a freelancer, if you're a contributor, which if you are trying to get a job in crypto, I think you should start freelancing. That's like the best way to break in. That's how I break in. I started writing, and then they like me and they say, hey, we want to have you full time.
00:22:58.872 - 00:23:36.084, Speaker F: Right. And what happens with a lot of these coordinates is that you enter the ambassador program, but if you're in a dow, who decides how much you get paid? That's like a tricky question, because the community should decide, right? So basically, what happens with coordinate, you say, with the whole ambassador program, hey, I did this this month. I did this this month. And then as a collective, they give you points, and according to how many points you get is how much you get paid. So it kind of becomes like the community, not the team, is voting on how much you get paid based on your contribution. And then the team could still have a say on, like, this person did a lot this month. But it's really cool.
00:23:36.084 - 00:24:08.770, Speaker F: I really like that idea of coordinate. The other thing that we're exploring with crypto babes is social tokens. And how can we give tokens to people in the community that are more active? Like, if you host an event, you get allocation of tokens, or if you contribute to the community, especially if you are a project that cryptobase is more on the nonprofit side. We're not fully monetized yet, but at some point, how can we allocate some type of tokens for people that are contributing? So those are two things that I really, really like. So, yeah, check them out.
00:24:12.500 - 00:24:50.972, Speaker D: Okay, so I love that you guys brought up dows, because crest network is actually a Dao as well. And we also have similar thing where we have, like, community bounties, and our community can propose projects and they can build them and get coins in return. And our community actually built this really awesome product called crust files. So basically it's like a decentralized Dropbox. You can store all your files in a decentralized manner for free. Or if you want encryption, you can also pay a little bit in crustcoin, which is like 0.1 of a dollar.
00:24:50.972 - 00:25:43.504, Speaker D: So it's really cheap to use and it's really easy to use. So for me, it's really important to have my files stored in a decentralized way so that I can have autonomy over my data. And then centralized companies, they can't use my data against me, they can't look at my data. So, yeah, having your data decentralized just basically means instead of having everything you digitally own in one server somewhere that a big company owns, you have your data spread all out throughout the world in random servers. So it's really great because then you now have ownership over your own data. There's not one person that can tell you, no, I'm not going to give you your data anymore. So that's why, yeah, decentralizing your data is important.
00:25:43.504 - 00:25:47.730, Speaker D: So if you guys want to use crest files, it's 100% free.
00:25:49.860 - 00:26:33.108, Speaker C: Awesome. I'm going to have to check that out. So, for me, I have the privilege of being on the near foundation. And so we kind of work through all of the grants and work with various projects that want to build on near or partner with near. And so it's kind of like a collective of everyone and what they were all saying. I get to see all of these really cool projects come through, and I think there's a lot to say in terms of just projects that really increase empowerment and just giving people access to this entire world that used to be very much like pay to play, right? Like, if you didn't have crypto, well, guess what? There isn't much you can do. But now there are so many ways to get involved.
00:26:33.108 - 00:26:55.990, Speaker C: So some things that I'm really bullish on are, like, learn to earn, play to earn. I think there's a lot of cool games that are being developed, and then, for me personally, I've had a lot of health issues throughout my life, and so healthcare is something that I'm very bullish on. And so, to Marcelo's point, I think there's a lot of potential in terms of what we can do with the technology and just, like, the healthcare space in general.
00:26:57.960 - 00:27:21.484, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Hey, I want to stop for a second here, Kevin. So we're running a bit behind, and is it okay if I extend our Q and a time for another 15 minutes? Not q and A, but our regular. Okay, great. Sounds good. Okay, so, actually, what I wanted to do is change it up a little bit. So how about since we've got.
00:27:21.484 - 00:27:48.920, Speaker A: Okay, well, an odd number, but half of you could answer one question, and then the next half can answer the other question, and I'll let you guys volunteer and see what you feel like answering. Okay, so the next question I wanted to ask is. So the title of this panel is women disrupting web3. So, what exactly are we disrupting, and why, in your opinion, are we here tonight?
00:27:50.700 - 00:28:20.016, Speaker C: We're disrupting the tech patriarchy. Sorry. But I do think there is an aspect of tech in general, has just been such a male dominated field, right. From the perspective of. I support a lot of developers in my role, and so a lot of times I'm working with men constantly. And I think there is something to be said for. Because a part of tonight, the discussion is around mass adoption, right.
00:28:20.016 - 00:29:05.376, Speaker C: If we're aiming for mass adoption, we can't have a very homogeneous group of people building for what is supposed to be the world. We need different perspectives, and we need to have various voices at the table. And so, for me, I think the reason why I got into web3 and why I'm here and really passionate about what I do is because I think we have this great opportunity to really disrupt the kind of culture of tech and to really open up the door to give people an opportunity to build and interact with really amazing projects. And that's me. I just want to get more diverse voices in the room, and I just.
00:29:05.398 - 00:29:19.270, Speaker E: Want to throw in a quick statistic. Research was done by Pew research this year that showed that 10% of women have invested in cryptocurrency and 22% of men have. So that's less than half. That's crazy.
00:29:23.100 - 00:29:29.630, Speaker A: Okay, I'll go on to the next question. Thanks for sharing the statistic. It's always good to know where we stand.
00:29:33.440 - 00:29:33.852, Speaker B: Okay.
00:29:33.906 - 00:29:48.240, Speaker A: All right, so how do you envision the future of web3, and how do we reach a more diverse blockchain community and kind of follow up to that is, are we currently going in the right direction?
00:29:49.300 - 00:30:11.768, Speaker F: Yeah, I'll answer that question. Something that I always go back and forth. Like, crypto babes is a woman led, woman focused, but we're not, like, woman only. Right. I always like to emphasize that because crypto is like a bubble, right. And some of you might not. It can be a toxic space in the sense that, are we empowering women or are women just hating on men? Right.
00:30:11.768 - 00:30:39.196, Speaker F: That's something that I'm like, okay, how can we create a space that, of course, it has to be inclusive. It can be disrespectful. You always have people that are doing sketchy stuff, but I'm always about, how can we have more diversity in the room? Like, a lot of our events, we try to have majority of women, right? And we do our best to have a safe space, but I'm never going to be, hey, men are not allowed. That's just our philosophy. And crypto babes.
00:30:39.228 - 00:30:39.472, Speaker B: Why?
00:30:39.526 - 00:31:06.936, Speaker F: Because at the end of the day, a lot of our sponsors, a lot of people that support us heavily are men. So for me, I always want to have, like, for example, today's audience is very diverse. I will say we have a good amount of men and women, and I'm super proud about that. I do like to have events that are for women only. Right. And then there's always also good to have events that are mixed. But I do think it should be, like, majority woman, just so we can create more of.
00:31:06.936 - 00:31:49.784, Speaker F: Like, you don't want to have a crypto babes event, and then 80% of the audience is man. That would be weird, right? So it's always thinking about, how can we create diversity? But the way I envision is that first we create more woman developers. That's something I want to see more. How can we get more women into rust? How can we get more women into learning solidity and other different languages? How can we get more women into not just marketing? Because I get that question a lot. Like, I've been to events and people ask me, oh, you're in marketing, and it's just like, yeah, but I know more than that. Right. So I'm always, how can we get more women into this technical roles? That's something that I want to see where it has to be, like, 50 50.
00:31:49.784 - 00:32:06.750, Speaker F: And I really do think for women, it can be really good to have a career in crypto. A lot of it is remote. You have a lot of flexibility, especially, like, if you're looking to have kids or if you're looking to have a family. I mean, I am. Right. That will be perfect for. Yeah.
00:32:07.360 - 00:32:31.296, Speaker E: I'm looking into the crowd right now, and I see some great female organizers here in the Bay Area. Cindy here has her own group, cryptocurious, and she hosts events for their educational events. Right, where you can come and learn about DFI. And I see Cynthia in the back, who also hosts female groups around web3. And I think that's great. I think one of the most important things we can do is to hold space for beginners.
00:32:31.328 - 00:32:31.668, Speaker F: Right.
00:32:31.754 - 00:32:47.432, Speaker E: That's why I started my Twitter, my Twitter account, I microtose. Sorry if I can't say that. Microdose web3, where I tweet out in just the length of a tweet, complex topics, and I try to break it down so that it's easily understood. I also started a spreadsheet of information.
00:32:47.566 - 00:32:47.864, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:47.902 - 00:32:51.230, Speaker E: So if you are brand new to crypto or the web3 space.
00:32:53.440 - 00:32:53.756, Speaker C: I.
00:32:53.778 - 00:33:17.670, Speaker E: Have this spreadsheet where you can just learn. You can totally binge the whole thing and spend time learning. You don't need to pay for anyone's course. And I guess just also know that nobody knows everything. And there's a lot of people who are new in this space and a lot of people who pretend to know it all, and in reality, they don't. So don't feel like this space has gone too far and you've been left behind. We are quite early, and it's never too late to start learning.
00:33:22.000 - 00:33:35.040, Speaker A: Great points. Yeah. I love having jargon broken down for me. You always feel embarrassing, embarrassed asking. Okay, all right, how do you.
00:33:35.110 - 00:33:35.440, Speaker B: Okay.
00:33:35.510 - 00:33:37.616, Speaker A: Actually, never mind. Next question.
00:33:37.718 - 00:33:38.080, Speaker B: Okay.
00:33:38.150 - 00:34:04.780, Speaker A: So with a growing attraction to technology and new industry thought leaders emerging from grand visions of a more truth based society, what is necessary to remain focused on the big picture and follow up question. And how can women support other women as we build a more decentralized world? Loaded.
00:34:09.220 - 00:34:16.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. Well, I really deeply respect.
00:34:18.200 - 00:34:19.510, Speaker C: People like yourself.
00:34:20.680 - 00:35:00.370, Speaker B: Like yourself, and who really put a lot of effort into bringing women together. And I used to do that for web two, actually. I was doing girls in technology initiative back on the east coast. I think it's so beautiful to just be a part of this event today. And a lot of women here could be exactly sitting right here. A lot of very bright women are here, as well as men. So not to say that, of course.
00:35:00.370 - 00:35:43.708, Speaker B: And I think building a different kind of industry, that's really more fair. Not in a sense of unfairness, but fair as an industry, fair as a society, fair as a humanity. We need to have opinions and contributions of all kind of people. The equilibrium is not broken. Right. We want to create a better future for everyone. And I'm really grateful for all the men that came here today, all the women.
00:35:43.708 - 00:36:31.950, Speaker B: And, yeah, I think the answer is, at least for myself, let's be kind. Let's be supportive of each other. Let's help each other. Let's keep our ethical considerations in place and not be driven by all the upsides and downsides of the crypto industry. That's very natural as being quite a novice industry. So, of course, the current situations, like economic, that will happen. But I think the most important thing is to really keep an eye on the price, which to me is a better world, and we can't build it without each other and everyone here.
00:36:33.120 - 00:36:34.540, Speaker A: Thank you, Elvie.
00:36:36.400 - 00:37:57.268, Speaker C: In terms of the bigger picture aspect, the initial question, I think one of the things, as we grow as an industry and as more players get into the game, I think one thing that I always try to stay mindful of is questioning, why are we all here? Why are we doing this? Because I think it's really easy to get caught up in all the hype and aping and diamond hands, all that nonsense. But at the end of the day, what brought you here? Why are you curious? And for me, it was very much like this idea of, like, wow, we can actually have ownership over our information and we don't have to be, like, commodities, essentially. And so I think it's important to always kind of check in with ourselves and just kind of keep ourselves humble in a way. And in terms of women empowering each other, I think tech has had such a narrative of a scarcity issue, right? Like, oh, there's only so many spaces up at the top for women, and so you have to beat out the other women to get up to the top. I feel like we are at a really great place in the industry right now, where we're still early. We're shaping the culture as we're going through this. And so I really want us to be able to build a culture of abundance.
00:37:57.268 - 00:38:30.470, Speaker C: And so it shouldn't be like, oh, we have to fill a certain quota of board members who are women or underrepresented groups. It's just like, we should just have opportunities. And if you see someone and you believe in what they're doing and you think they're great, empower them and support them and amplify what they're doing, I think it's not even necessarily like, how do we empower other women? It's just approaching it as, hey, you're doing something amazing, and I'm going to plus one that.
00:38:33.960 - 00:39:13.024, Speaker A: Yeah, we really have to kind of be vocal for each other as well. So when we see someone doing good, maybe taking a risk, yeah, we should definitely give them more attention for that. Okay, then I guess we'll move to the next question. So what advice would you give young women entering the web3 or tech space who are striving to advance their careers or get more involved in the future that we are building? So any unique, specific advice or maybe something that worked for you?
00:39:13.222 - 00:39:25.510, Speaker E: I can go first. Go to meetup. Find the meetup. Go. Go to a conference, network in the space. If you have genuine interest, pull up YouTube, type something in, listen to it. Just get started.
00:39:28.430 - 00:39:30.140, Speaker H: Can we also ask questions.
00:39:34.030 - 00:39:39.950, Speaker A: In just a couple more minutes? We're almost out of remain questions, but yes. Thank you for being so excited.
00:39:40.610 - 00:40:09.286, Speaker F: Just really quick since I know we probably want to get to the questions. The other thing is, ask a lot of questions, like when you come to these events, ask about the roles, how do they look like? Because crypto looks very glamorous to work, but it can't be quite a lot like it's a 24/7 culture. So you have to be willing to. Am I willing to take those hours? Right? Especially if you have a decentralized team. You might have to meet with somebody at 11:00 p.m. Like me. Right, 11:00 p.m.
00:40:09.286 - 00:40:36.702, Speaker F: And is their morning time, because it's the only time that works. So you have to ask yourself, okay, what are they doing? How does their everyday look like? Are they a developer? How long do I have to code? If they're doing marketing, when are the best times to tweet things like that? Ask questions about the roles and honestly, just shoot your shot. Like, are you hiring? Are you hiring? Are you hiring? Join the telegram. Group chats. Literally, even right now, the market's down. People are hiring like crazy. But I will tell you a secret.
00:40:36.702 - 00:40:58.920, Speaker F: The best crypto jobs are not on LinkedIn. They're in networks, they're in the telegrams. So join the telegram. So if you're not on telegram, make one right now and add you to like ten group chats that do jobs. Literally come to me and I'll add you to a bunch of group chats. I literally have like 20,000 unread messages right now. So this is how much on telegram I am.
00:40:59.930 - 00:41:21.040, Speaker E: Can I just add one thing to that? Even if you don't have a technical background, your skills are still needed in this space. Right. I was just at a conference this weekend, and everyone who, it was an all woman conference. And all the women who were working in crypto, a lot of them were ops. They were the operations of the team. And so whatever skills you have, they are applicable in this space.
00:41:21.810 - 00:41:47.942, Speaker D: Yeah, actually, I want to piggyback off of that because something that Alejandra said earlier was like, really resonated with me, was that people always ask her, are you in marketing? Because people always, when I go to conferences, people always ask, they walk up to me, they're like, oh, what's your role? Marketing. Marketing. And in the beginning, I was kind of offended by this because I was like, well, why do you think I'm marketing? Maybe I can code, too.
00:41:47.996 - 00:41:48.600, Speaker E: Okay.
00:41:50.010 - 00:42:29.106, Speaker D: But actually, I think it's really important that we start valuing marketing roles more because, yes, there is a lot of women in marketing, and marketing is what brings the money to the table. So just because it's like a women filled role right now doesn't mean that it's any less important than developers. A lot of the web, three companies right now, they're being almost run completely by developers. And a lot of developers, they talk a lot of about people that are nontechnical and they're like, oh, they don't know what they're talking about, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I look on their Twitters and it's just bots everywhere. Bots, bots, bots, bots, bots, bots farming. This is such a big problem.
00:42:29.106 - 00:43:03.070, Speaker D: Honestly, if you can do social media audits, go on their social media. See, is it bots in the comments or are these real comments? If you can identify that there are bots there, you can send them a DM and say, look, you have this many, you can actually put their social medias in websites online, figure out how many bots they have on their account and send it to them. Say, this is how many bots you have, okay? And this is what I can do for you. You can get a job like that very easily. There's so many people that are doing freelance social media content making, and they're making a lot of money. You can charge like, $5,000 a month just to run someone's Twitter account. Seriously.
00:43:03.070 - 00:43:20.930, Speaker D: But, yeah, just to piggyback off of what they said as well, just go to events and meet people. That's exactly how I got my job. I just started going to events. I was really shy at first to go and talk to random people, but you really just have to go, because think about it, what would a man do?
00:43:21.080 - 00:43:22.014, Speaker A: That's what I told myself.
00:43:22.072 - 00:43:28.502, Speaker D: What would a man do? They would just go up to someone and just introduce themselves, and they would just start bragging, and they would just start mansplaining something.
00:43:28.556 - 00:43:28.870, Speaker F: Right.
00:43:28.940 - 00:43:41.740, Speaker D: So just do that, too. You don't have to mansplain, but you can just go up to someone. Oh, yeah, I've done this, this and that. What do you do? And, I mean, these are networking events, so people are really used to it. So don't be scared. Just go for it.
00:43:45.490 - 00:44:26.950, Speaker C: And just to kind of close it off. I know I've been harping on the potential and untapped possibilities, but there really are so many things that we haven't even really thought about. We haven't had a chance to work on yet. And the technology is finally catching up to where we can actually put some of these things into practice. And so I would say if you're young or if you're new to the space and want to get involved, just be curious and ask a lot of questions. Don't be afraid to sound stupid. And as much as I hate that, I think, once again, kind of going back to the imposter syndrome.
00:44:26.950 - 00:44:58.930, Speaker C: Everyone's so afraid of not knowing everything. And one of the things that I've really appreciated is some of the veterans in this space who've been here for, like, ten years, and they're like, I have no idea what is going on right now. And so I think at the end of the day, just remember, no one really knows what's happening, and so there's just so much happening every day. So don't be afraid. Just get involved. We would love to have more people. We're all about bringing on the new kind of next generation.
00:45:02.500 - 00:45:14.390, Speaker A: Okay, let's get our audience asking questions. Okay, I'm actually going to give the microphone right over to you since you told us right away you want to talk.
00:45:14.760 - 00:45:15.220, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:45:15.290 - 00:45:24.736, Speaker H: Thanks a lot. Thanks, girls. I have one quick question, just maybe from both sides, from investors perspective, and from B.
00:45:24.778 - 00:45:26.040, Speaker D: Two C perspective.
00:45:26.620 - 00:46:00.764, Speaker H: How do you see a mass adoption of all the technologies? When will they happen? I mean, like millions of people using all kinds of products, like LinkedIn, but on blockchain, like ancestry, but on blockchain, something else on blockchain. When will it happen? And the other question is, like, why combinator said that in 18 months, like two years, it was so terrible with financing. What's your perspective on that in terms of crypto? How bad it will be the financing for crypto projects?
00:46:00.892 - 00:46:51.250, Speaker B: Yeah, so I can take that. So the reason why blockchain space is not as developed or popular or mainstream yet is because blockchain technology is not developed yet to the point where it could be. So think about Web two. Web two took about 15 years to really get to where it is now. Right? And at that point, there were now obviously Ubers and Facebook was really kind of recent. At that time it was like HTTP and all those, and there was no AWS. So you had to have literally database on your laptop if you wanted to launch a product.
00:46:51.250 - 00:47:36.770, Speaker B: So we're kind of like at that stage right now for Web three, which I'm actually very actively working on to get web3 to that spot where we can start launching great products that are very user friendly right now, as you guys, most of you know, it's not really user friendly. It's hard. Right. It takes time to really get your head around it. I'd say that I think the infrastructure is just not there yet, but we're working hard to get it there day and night, sometimes with calls at quite late. So decentralized teams. But, yeah, I'd say that that's my perspective on that.
00:47:37.300 - 00:48:02.404, Speaker E: I can add on to that. So Wells Fargo, their investments arm, released an article recently that said that we are at 1990 level Internet rates. So we're following the Internet curve very closely. And so we're at 1990 level. So think about what the Internet looked like in 1990, right? I mean, it's evolved and it's grown so much, but we are actually very closely following that curve.
00:48:02.452 - 00:48:07.248, Speaker D: It's quite fascinating about investment from micromanager.
00:48:07.284 - 00:48:11.310, Speaker H: Said, like, guys, you should raise right now or it's gone.
00:48:12.000 - 00:48:52.330, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely not to your perspective, 1990s, right? So Amazon, Google, all those guys really hit up in 1997. So we've got like seven years. So we're good in terms of investments, but not to be on a serious note, of course. Yeah, they're great opportunities now. They're going to be great opportunities later. I think a lot of the projects right now just trying to figure out what the hell is going on. And I think the recent events, like big security bridges, like Luna, like crazy what's going on right now in defy especially, I think really shows us a lot of weak spots in web3.
00:48:52.330 - 00:49:08.540, Speaker B: And in a sense, I am glad that we're having that right now because otherwise we would never have started even tackling those problems. So now we're going to start having solutions, people built to address them, which is great because only that way we can really start rising.
00:49:09.940 - 00:50:00.552, Speaker C: I can also speak, too, in terms of funding projects right now. I think there's a lot of movement and lot of hype about or for the past few years, there's been a lot of hype in the industry, and a lot of projects have been getting insane amounts of funding just because there's free flowing money and there's just a lot of excitement. But now a lot of people are calling this like a crypto winter. I will say being a part of near foundation. Near was actually born in 2018 during the last crypto winter. And one of the things that we firmly believe in is that great things can happen even during downturns. And so I think when things are a bit quieter like this, really amazing projects can, if they're there, there's always going to be funding.
00:50:00.552 - 00:50:14.836, Speaker C: So I don't think it should ever discourage people from wanting to start out on their own venture just because they're afraid they won't be able to raise if your product is great. Hey, there will always be people interested in supporting you.
00:50:15.018 - 00:50:25.830, Speaker E: And just this weekend, I was at all female conference and we gave away $25,000 to female innovators. And so the money exists. You just have to go and find it.
00:50:26.600 - 00:50:32.760, Speaker D: Yeah, I can actually also talk about investment in the industry right now because I previously worked in VC as well.
00:50:32.830 - 00:50:33.450, Speaker C: And.
00:50:35.980 - 00:51:14.612, Speaker D: A lot of VCs, they're starting to tighten their reins. They're getting a little cocky, but they're still deploying capital. They're all still deploying capital at the conferences. I think I went to this one crypto dinner and almost everyone there was a VC I had to leave because I was like, okay, we're not raising right now. So in terms of companies that were slowly selling some of their coins so that they could maintain a cash balance, they're probably going to make it through the crypto winter. But, yeah, I think we're still going to see VCs deploying capital. It's just in.
00:51:14.612 - 00:51:27.176, Speaker D: What are they going to be deploying capital? I don't think we're going to see VCs giving out a million dollars for an NFT free mint anymore? Probably not. We're just going to see them more interested in actually building.
00:51:27.358 - 00:51:41.390, Speaker B: On my way here, I actually saw on Twitter that the NFT was sold for $2.4 million, something like right now, like an hour ago. I don't know if that's what actual happened, but that was the Twitter announcement. But you never know.
00:51:41.840 - 00:51:54.630, Speaker E: The last thing I want to say is that when you go to these events, a lot of the times there are VCs here, especially at conferences. I have a ton of VC friends and they just hang out at conferences because they're looking for their next opportunity to fund, too.
00:51:56.600 - 00:52:08.264, Speaker A: Another question, Sparrow. I'm going to walk all the way back over here, or if you could meet me halfway. Yes, I can. Everyone else can too. Great in the back as well.
00:52:08.382 - 00:52:13.880, Speaker I: So I'm advising a project that's working with Bitfly.
00:52:14.540 - 00:52:24.110, Speaker A: 1 second in the back. Can we have a. Excuse me, in the back. We need to hear one of our people here.
00:52:28.720 - 00:52:29.372, Speaker C: Hi, everybody.
00:52:29.426 - 00:53:38.452, Speaker I: I'm Sparrow Rogers and I'm an investor in this space, but I also sit on the board of charitable projects that are trying to advance themselves through web3. And one of the projects I'm working with is actually trying to combine FiTFi with a Dow governance structure to incentivize walking your dog. And so we've got a really cool team. We've got crypto hedge fund manager who's really cool at advising overall strategy, and we've got some really cool people, but we don't have the actual technical people on the team to build it out or to say, this mechanism needs to trigger this mechanism, which needs the flywheel. And so the question I have about some of the funding grant or VC, the project is kind of on hold because they think like a traditional VC, you have to have everything locked up and planned out or you can't go ask for support. And so it seems to me like this is a slightly different opportunity, that there might be an opportunity to plug into some backing because it's technical and financial, really, these projects need that kind of support. And my question to the panelists is, if they have a lot of it locked, let's say the 80 20 rule, let's say they've got 80% of the plan, but 20% is really how do the mechanisms work in a way that's viable for real world assets, right? The real world assets being that off chain stuff.
00:53:38.452 - 00:53:54.728, Speaker I: And we talked to some people at Chainlink about using oracle technology to validate that you're walking your dog, which is super cool. But the question know, how should they approach for funding? Should they take the grant route or should they really wait to lock it down with all the details and all the mechanics before they talk to you all. Thank you.
00:53:54.814 - 00:54:28.640, Speaker F: What I would recommend for that is looked into accelerators. So there's actually quite a few of let I know near has their own and we're looking to get into, like, I have to talk to her after this, so don't talk to her. But there's a lot of really cool accelerators that give you a lot of support. It depends. Some of them might take a share, some of them don't. And especially if you're looking to build in a blockchain. So there's a lot of incentives if you go to layer ones and say, hey, I'm going to build in your blockchain.
00:54:28.640 - 00:54:53.496, Speaker F: Sometimes they even give you support, like technical support. Sometimes support can look many different ways. Are you looking for funding or are you looking for technical support? Even our team, we were looking to go the Dow route. We were looking to go into an accelerator and they were offering to give us technical help, which was really awesome. So I would recommend that. I don't think you need to have everything. Even projects that say they have everything, they really don't.
00:54:53.496 - 00:55:05.010, Speaker F: They just sell themselves to look like they do and then they go back home. And how, how are we doing? Like, we just got a bunch of money, so you don't have to have everything.
00:55:07.300 - 00:56:05.092, Speaker C: And to kind of repeat what Alejandra said previously, shoot your shot. I think there's a lot of opportunity out there. If you have something concrete that you can show amazing, you're steps ahead of a lot of other people. But if you have a very well formulated idea and you have, I think the biggest challenge that we've kind of run into from the near foundation side, from our funding arm is these very technical kind of projects that don't have technical people. And so it's just like if you have someone who can build it and you have the idea, you have the people to kind of deploy it, but you just don't have the funding quite yet or you need that last step support. Please do apply. And I know I don't just speak for near, I know I speak for every layer one at this point.
00:56:05.092 - 00:56:25.930, Speaker C: We're all very much on board to know. Alejandra also said this, but yeah, there are tons of accelerators out there, but also like any layer one, we are actively building out these kind of support networks and self service platforms to really help founders. And so definitely go for it.
00:56:26.300 - 00:56:26.776, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:56:26.798 - 00:56:27.492, Speaker C: I'm just curious.
00:56:27.556 - 00:56:31.868, Speaker I: A lot of accelerators are just offline. They have no upcoming product like radium and people like that.
00:56:31.874 - 00:56:35.864, Speaker C: We're just offline. Just go directly to the protocols.
00:56:35.992 - 00:56:36.380, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:36.450 - 00:56:47.252, Speaker F: So there is like near Dow. What's the name of the Dow accelerator for nearly?
00:56:47.416 - 00:57:09.668, Speaker C: Okay, so I'm just going to plug near right now. So go to near grants. Okay. So grant money is literally free. You don't have to give any equity. It's free money. And yes, all of the layer ones are getting a little bit choosier in terms of what they're funding, but it's not necessarily because they don't have the funding anymore.
00:57:09.668 - 00:57:41.200, Speaker C: There are so many funds out there, and a lot of layer ones have also done big raises recently. And so it's not a lack of funding, it's just that the sheer number of applications coming in are larger. And so it's not that there's not enough money to go out, it's just the influx of interest is outweighed by the actual amount of money. And so I would say definitely take advantage of the fact that there is this free money. Check it out. Near slash grants.
00:57:41.780 - 00:58:01.300, Speaker D: So I want to plug crust really quick because we also have an ecosystem fund, because we're also layer one. So if you store your company's data with crust, then you can also join our ecosystem fund. It's called Infinity Labs. But unlike near, we do take some equity.
00:58:01.380 - 00:58:02.490, Speaker C: But yeah.
00:58:05.880 - 00:58:08.470, Speaker A: You'Ve got a question. I want to give you the microphone as well.
00:58:09.740 - 00:58:39.696, Speaker H: Thank you. So I'm actually early stage VC myself, investing and exploring a lot of industries, including Web three. So on the panel, there's obviously a bunch of women who really experience in working with developers, helping build the ecosystem with different layer one foundations. So I want to know from an investor perspective, what are some of the things that, from your experience, what are.
00:58:39.718 - 00:58:40.576, Speaker F: Some of the things that you need.
00:58:40.598 - 00:59:03.960, Speaker H: To be aware as investor or as grant giver or as ecosystem builder? You need to be aware of working with web3 builders, because from my experience, web3 builders, engineers are slightly different from the traditional web two builders. So just want to hear some of your experience, something that we need to be cautious of as investors.
00:59:06.140 - 00:59:38.532, Speaker F: Something really quick. Make sure they have some type of security background. A lot of projects are getting hacked right now. A lot of projects, some of them the funniest thing. Well, not funny, but still, they will get an audit and get hacked because of web two, like a phishing attack or they will get audited bug bounties, they'll have all of these things done and then the exploit is web two. Right. So you need to really make sure they have, and I work in security, so I will just say make sure they have an understanding in security.
00:59:38.532 - 01:00:10.572, Speaker F: They're taking the right steps because a lot of VCs have lost money because of all this exploit. So just make sure they have a strong background on that. And talking with developers is like, definitely if you're like, I'm a very social person, something that I have to do is match my energy like mirror with them because I can be like a lot. Right. So really you're right, like web two developers and web3 developers. I think web3 developers are more quirky, which is a good thing. It's just like getting to know them.
01:00:10.572 - 01:00:12.110, Speaker F: I think that's really important.
01:00:14.000 - 01:01:02.652, Speaker C: And I think looking ahead in terms of obviously we're here and we're talking about how do we get more people interested in building in web3, utilizing web3 technology. And so I think looking ahead as you're looking through potential investments, for me it's very much about who's the team and why are they doing this, right. Especially for the last few years, there were a lot of people who just got into it because they were like, there's so much money, I'm going to get in and see how much I can get. And I personally have not seen this, but I've heard of projects that would just apply to all the layer ones just to see what they can get. And obviously that's not great. That's not what we're here for.
01:01:02.706 - 01:01:02.972, Speaker B: Right.
01:01:03.026 - 01:01:16.790, Speaker C: Just keep yourself humble, keep asking yourself, why are you doing this? And so I think it's really important to kind of look at the team and really analyze why are they trying to do this project?
01:01:18.840 - 01:02:04.450, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think I touched on this earlier, but making sure there's someone on their team that's actually dedicated to doing marketing because a lot of developers love using bot marketing. I don't know why, but they're like, oh, I can just code up this bot and then it will just send a bunch of mass emails to people or DMs on Instagram. A lot of this stuff is not sustainable. And if you start off your Twitters or TikToks or whatever accounts with bot followers, you're just going to gain more bot followers. Like you're never actually going to gain real community. So yeah, I think right now the space has gotten an influx of so many companies that are exactly the same. If you're not doing good marketing, you're just not going to make it at this point.
01:02:07.270 - 01:02:50.620, Speaker B: I think to me it really comes to a team, and if they have a background in that, that's really good in what they're doing in that specific domain. Expertise, if not to me, it's really important. Do they actually care? Do they have the passion? I love supporting founders that cannot stop talking about their product. You are at the dinner with them, it's like 08:00 p.m. Like Friday, and they keep talking about their product. And I'm like, I want to invest in you because I know you're going to make it happen. You're not there for something else.
01:02:50.620 - 01:03:11.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's like a very big piece for me. And then another thing is that the founders know each other, know each other for some time and not just met a month ago on the hackathon, although that could be a good story, too. But I tend to think that founders really need to go through difficult times together.
01:03:14.330 - 01:03:28.940, Speaker A: Excellent points from all of you. Okay, last question over here from gentlemen. So, Kevin, can we take more questions or should we?
01:03:29.790 - 01:03:31.178, Speaker F: Okay, two questions.
01:03:31.264 - 01:03:31.900, Speaker B: Okay.
01:03:36.670 - 01:04:26.720, Speaker G: So one of my questions relates to one of the points I was mentioned before, which talked about how crypto is growing, sort of like the web in the sort of 90s. Well, that sort of sounds a bit sort of concerning to me since, well, at the end of the 90s, there was the.com bubble, which crashed. How do you sort of deal with the realities of this sort of excited space? Maybe heading towards that direction, especially since, well, if you create wealth for sort of minority groups through the space and that crash happens, only the sort of, well, you might call like the quote unquote old money in a sense, will be able to sort of sustain through it. And the sort of old money is a sort of very homogeneous group. So how do you sort of get through that?
01:04:28.050 - 01:04:47.154, Speaker B: Yeah, look, especially new industries, we're going to have ups and downs. I don't think this is the last down in the blockchain industry we're going to see. We're going to see that bubble that you're talking about. Probably, maybe not. But I think it's a cycle, right?
01:04:47.192 - 01:04:48.530, Speaker C: It's a cycle of life, too.
01:04:48.600 - 01:05:26.186, Speaker B: Everyone's life is like up and down, up and down. And I think the only constant is change, like as quirky sounds, but you just optimize for it, and then you just keep doing whatever you need to do with your tenacity. And build up confidence. But yeah, I think the good quality product is going to always survive. Built by great team. You always want to optimize for that. Sometimes I personally go through challenges and I started being, getting nervous.
01:05:26.186 - 01:05:43.000, Speaker B: I'm like, but I cannot control that. I cannot control this. But then I remember the only thing I can control really is the output, the quality of my work. That's all I can do. It ends up being always the right choice, the right decision, because I'm still ahead.
01:05:44.730 - 01:06:31.638, Speaker C: Yeah. And to add to that, I think even right now, right, there are a lot of projects that might not survive this winter. And so I keep saying this, but there's been so much hype and so many projects that got funded. And at the end of the day, if your technology isn't solid, if your product isn't solid, the cracks are going to show. And at this point, I feel like everyone's looking very closely at all the cracks. And so if your product has a lot of cracks, then guess what, it's probably not going to make it, but kind of to what everyone else's head, if you have a good product, if you have a good team, you're going to make it. And I think also for me, from my perspective, adaptability, right.
01:06:31.638 - 01:07:06.720, Speaker C: If you originally had Runway of, I don't know, like two years, and then all of a sudden the faucet of money is gone, then adapt. Figure out how you can make that last three years, four years. And if you have to rethink certain strategies or the direction in which you are wanting to go, be ready to do that. I think that's the most important thing because if you just get bogged down and like, oh, the market's not good, I'm not going to be able to get funding. There's going to be other people out there who are going to be hustling and so just hustle like them.
01:07:07.750 - 01:07:12.100, Speaker A: Be very agile. Okay, last question.
01:07:12.470 - 01:07:16.900, Speaker F: It was in the back over there. Just want to make sure I'm like, I saw you.
01:07:17.270 - 01:07:18.020, Speaker B: Okay.
01:07:22.330 - 01:07:29.302, Speaker D: It's kind of a general question, though. Yeah, sorry, excuse me. Yeah, just like trying to ask because.
01:07:29.356 - 01:08:06.690, Speaker H: I'm running Hobie listing team for a long time and we are currently having a program that are supporting different public chains. So like near Polygon, even special ecosystem, like crass network. So all those ecosystem that are really top tier right now. Just wanted to ask, especially from all the women power that we are having today, trying to understand what your think on the next wave is. So what's going to be the most FOMO part, the FOMO track that you guys think of, is that likely.
01:08:08.550 - 01:08:10.286, Speaker B: The next wave in the industry?
01:08:10.398 - 01:08:23.382, Speaker H: Yes, the FOMO topic, probably before what? The FOMO topic that you guys were investing in support on right now.
01:08:23.436 - 01:08:24.040, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:08:25.230 - 01:09:05.286, Speaker B: I personally predict that the industry is going to get more robust just because of all the weaknesses we start seeing. So I think we're going to start seeing a lot of solutions that's going to address those, especially in defy security. It's going to get stronger. I think that's the next wave. I think regulatory environments are going to change significantly in the upcoming year. Personal opinion? Obviously, I don't know, but I think regulators going to start really looking to this after a few quite known incidents. Yeah.
01:09:05.286 - 01:09:08.694, Speaker B: So those are my two predictions for me.
01:09:08.732 - 01:09:10.950, Speaker E: I think also security and privacy.
01:09:12.990 - 01:09:41.726, Speaker C: And I also agree security, privacy, but I think also technologies like chain link, like Oracles, tools that help bridge kind of web two and web3, especially as we're looking towards mass adoption. Well, guess what? I'm never going to be able to convince my mom to stop using Facebook. But what can we do so that we can kind of import that data over and utilize it so that she actually owns whatever activity or data that she creates.
01:09:41.758 - 01:09:41.954, Speaker B: Right.
01:09:41.992 - 01:10:20.894, Speaker C: And so I think there's a huge kind of need for these technologies or projects that will actually bridge that gap so that they almost kind of sit in like Web 2.5 because I don't think in my next five to ten years we're going to get to a point where it's purely web3. And even if we did, at the end of the day, the end user shouldn't even know about that. Right. If you ask my mom now, she knows what Web three is because I work in it. But if you ask any other person who's of a certain group where they're not super tech savvy, they don't really care whether they're using web two technology or web3.
01:10:20.932 - 01:10:21.134, Speaker B: Right.
01:10:21.172 - 01:10:40.582, Speaker C: And so at the end of the day, I think anything that kind of really bridges that gap and makes that transition as seamless as possible, I think that's what is really going to kind of take us to that next level infrastructure. Any kind of like bridges? Yeah, I think so.
01:10:40.716 - 01:11:00.778, Speaker F: If you can create a bridge that doesn't get hacked, that will be a bridge. Most hacks have been bridges, so that's important. Oh, yeah. By the way, if you're a developer and want to explore web3 security, that's where the money is at right now.
01:11:00.944 - 01:11:04.474, Speaker C: Yeah. A security audit right now runs about sixty K, I think.
01:11:04.512 - 01:11:04.666, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:11:04.688 - 01:11:18.926, Speaker F: And the waiting list is like a year. Right. So if you could do it yourself. I mean, I've seen people get paid a million dollars for a bug. Mean, I help with bug bounties, like run bug bounties. If you're an auditor, reach out to me. I mean, I can help you.
01:11:18.926 - 01:11:21.954, Speaker F: If you discover a bug, we can get you paid.
01:11:22.072 - 01:11:27.860, Speaker C: Yeah. Nier also just launched our own auditing service as well. So if y'all want to get involved, let me know.
01:11:28.390 - 01:11:52.380, Speaker D: Yeah, and there's also this thing called MPC key, which I think is going to get really big. So it's like, for also key security for corporations and stuff like that. And also, I think maybe key security for individuals will be very huge because a lot of people are seeing their accounts, their wallets get hacked just by clicking a link. So, yeah, I think that's going to be big.
01:11:54.370 - 01:12:10.290, Speaker A: Great insights from everybody here and great questions from our audience. We can't take any more questions right now, but we're going to thank our audience. Sorry, thank our panelists and audience.
01:12:12.150 - 01:12:13.026, Speaker B: And you.
01:12:13.128 - 01:12:15.540, Speaker C: Thank you for leading miss.
01:12:20.250 - 01:12:33.890, Speaker A: And I guess what you can do is ask them individually. Now, you're free to run up to them. Not too close, but please, you guys can continue questions and have our networking session.
