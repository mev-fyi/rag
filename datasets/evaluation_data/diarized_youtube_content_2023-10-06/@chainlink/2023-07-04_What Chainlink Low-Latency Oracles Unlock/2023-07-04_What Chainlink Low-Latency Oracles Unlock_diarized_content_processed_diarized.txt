00:00:00.250 - 00:00:51.610, Speaker A: I think I'm very excited by these new oracles, the fact that we are now starting to capture a lot more information with regards to the precise timing as information is aggregated. It just had market depths for information in time. I know this will extend to things like volatility measures and other parameters, all of which will be available for DeFi protocols to be able to ingest and allow their smart contracts and their systems to be able to gain the insight of that information. And the reason that information is valuable is it allows you to price products more efficiently. You can price a swap more efficiently. If you understand the volatility of an asset, you can potentially again change how you are dealing with those market conditions and basically create more robust systems.
