00:00:01.850 - 00:01:09.100, Speaker A: I think that from DeFi to environmental carbon credit systems to the ability to eliminate various fraud dynamics with not annual audits, but second by second, cryptographically guaranteed audits, we're essentially solving multiple societal problems, whether that's access to banking or insurance or mitigation of climate outcomes, or actually the reversal of them through reforestation initiatives, as well as the ability for the world to work in a predictable, reliable way without having to rely on basically a people based process. And being able to switch to a cryptographically guaranteed, mathematically proven process that doesn't have to do with people's choices. It has to do with encryption and cryptography working as expected, which basically means you move to a system where physics guarantee things instead of a system where people guarantee things. And the movement to a cryptographically guaranteed world from a people guaranteed world is, I think, a colossal shift, which will only become more important as existing systems that propose to solve problems don't solve those problems. And.
