00:00:34.450 - 00:01:02.998, Speaker A: Hi, everybody. Welcome to building cross chain value. We have a bunch of great speakers today. I'd like to introduce Jay, VP of marketing at Ava Labs, Jimmy Chang, the product manager at Aave, and Michael Coo of Ren Labs. Please, everybody, give them a warm welcome, them for being here today. So I just want this panel to be very open format. Feel free to just have open dialogue, conversate, don't have to answer the questions directly, just here to hear your insights.
00:01:02.998 - 00:01:20.550, Speaker A: So to start off, number one, the question I will memorize these one day. What is something in general that you've just completely missed in life? You're just wrong. You're so passionate about it, but you just got it wrong. Happy to start with, Jay.
00:01:21.530 - 00:01:57.314, Speaker B: Yes. I don't know if this is something I'm passionate about, but I was definitely wrong about COVID So I think everyone agree there. Probably relate to that, maybe. And if you were right, and then in the crypto context, maybe one thing was metaverses. I don't think I was necessarily bearish on the idea, but early days, I know. I think most of us have pretty deep backgrounds in the space, relatively speaking. You saw the user experience and you're really playing around with, I don't know, say something like Decentraland and you're kind of looking around and you're saying, well, we're clearly early, so I'm not really sure.
00:01:57.314 - 00:02:16.920, Speaker B: I can't really see what the future looks like. I think right now we've accelerated quite a bit. The infrastructure is much stronger. I think the user experience is much better, still has a ton to improve, but I think it's much better. So if now I'm kind of turning the page a little bit and saying, all right, well, maybe there is something here, but I'm not exactly sure what that is, actually, for what it's worth.
00:02:17.530 - 00:02:18.850, Speaker A: Yeah. Care to elaborate?
00:02:18.930 - 00:02:43.940, Speaker C: Yeah. Mine would be actually very similar to Jay's, Covid, definitely. I was like, it's going to be over in two weeks, no big deal. But, yeah, obviously it didn't happen. And I think NFTs being the vehicle for public kind of adoption or public recognition of crypto over the last five to six months, I would have scoffed at the idea, to be honest with you, and completely wrong. So, yeah, I'm definitely coming around to that.
00:02:44.310 - 00:02:45.566, Speaker A: How about you, Jimmy?
00:02:45.678 - 00:03:25.182, Speaker D: I would say in a general sense, I was really wrong about not having a healthy relationship with my parents, but that's a lot to unpack at a happy hour, but we're working through it. But from a crypto sense. I was super wrong about crypto punks, okay? They were even nothing like this time last year. I remember people were like talking about nifties. That's what they called them. Last year. It was like a rebrand that luckily died and I was like, I don't really know.
00:03:25.182 - 00:03:39.058, Speaker D: I'm really into defi. I'm really into payments, like financial services. I don't really think this crypto punk's NFT thing is going to be like a big thing. Right. And so obviously a year later, I have a lot of NFTs and have capitulated a lot.
00:03:39.224 - 00:03:53.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like generally a lot of people in the DeFi space didn't really see the whole NFT craze coming as big as it did, but happy it did for so many people. So on the flip side, what's something that you got right while building Ave Ren and Avalab?
00:03:53.930 - 00:04:33.940, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to start. I think one thing we did really well and timed really well is interoperability. We started off as a dark pool protocol and then kind of evolved into an interoperability protocol kind of spring 2019 and then built our product. And then really May 2020 is when we released RedVM. And that's when we saw DFI summer kick off. That's when we saw BTC or raft BTC variants really picking up as collateral within the DFI ecosystem, and we actually helped catalyze that. You can see WBTC's growth along with Ren BTC's growth really kick off around June 2020.
00:04:33.940 - 00:04:38.600, Speaker C: So that's something we definitely got right. So we're excited for it.
00:04:39.450 - 00:05:08.474, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe for us. In the avalanche context, I think what generally worked out was leaning into what was already strong and not trying to reinvent the wheel. So I think specifically having the EVM run on avalanche, I think that was the biggest play for some time. It actually didn't seem like it was going to pay off, at least for the year. And in a bull market, that year is probably ten years. So it really felt like a long time. But now you're really seeing developers, especially people that are building saying, all right, well, I already know solidity.
00:05:08.474 - 00:05:37.426, Speaker B: I already know all the tools that are here, so why would I relearn something that I just learned maybe three, four years ago? Instead, they're able to port over their applications. And I think that's really minimizing the time to market. So I think that's something that's really important. And then broadly speaking, ux, I think ux is something that's super important. I know we've been talking about it a lot. We know each other from previous roles too. And so right now I think what's happening is the obscuring of the complexities of blockchain.
00:05:37.426 - 00:06:05.566, Speaker B: You're starting to see that with things like Topshot, you're starting to see that and not necessarily implemented in the best way, I guess, in the kind of most decentralized way. But I actually have the stance that it doesn't necessarily have to be like that on day one. Hopefully in the future we'll strive to kind of meet those metrics, but right now it's kind of like you kind of need to start jogging before you start sprinting. So kind of leaning into what's strong, I guess, is the takeaway.
00:06:05.758 - 00:06:37.386, Speaker D: Yeah, super important. I think one thing that we got right from building the Ave protocol is trusting our community. And so building a right on chain governance structure that allows for everyone to feel empowered to actually keep the safety and the integrity of the protocol. And so now we have a very vibrant ecosystem of contributors who are very, very aligned on making sure that the Ave protocol is safe. Right. And we have a very growing ecosystem of subdals that are really invested into this. And so we have the risk Dao that is getting spun up.
00:06:37.386 - 00:06:51.774, Speaker D: We have the grant style, we want a devdao eventually as well. And so being the core team is just one of many very interested and powerful stakeholders in governing the Ave protocol. And that's something that I'm super, super proud of.
00:06:51.892 - 00:07:01.570, Speaker A: Awesome. And maybe this will be helpful for people who are a little bit newer to crypto, but would you guys mind explaining what your project does specifically and how it has any unique value? Prop?
00:07:01.990 - 00:07:21.542, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I'll kick it off. So, yeah, as noted, we're an interoperability protocol. Our product is called RenVM. And essentially what we do is take bitcoin, which is a standalone blockchain, and then allow it to function on Ethereum as an ERC 20. So you can think of it in a very simple terms as an adapter. That takes bitcoin, which is actually a very good example.
00:07:21.542 - 00:07:23.814, Speaker C: It's like Mac and windows, they just don't communicate.
00:07:23.862 - 00:07:24.026, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:24.048 - 00:07:57.170, Speaker C: They're two different operating systems. So we've essentially allowed or created a bridge in between the two that allow the two to communicate. So we take bitcoin, which is its own operating system essentially, and then we bridge it over to Ethereum as a wrapped asset, and then it's an ERC 20, so you can go and take it and do whatever you want, you can loan it out as collateral, you can trade it for an ERC 20, like die. So that's essentially what we've released back in May 2020. And to date we've done almost $9 million in volume. So it's been really successful. So, yeah, that's renvm in a nutshell.
00:07:57.590 - 00:08:24.414, Speaker B: Very impressive for avalanche. Avalanche is a layer one with smart contracts. And so like I mentioned before, it has the EVM running on it. That's effectively the proof of concept for this function called subnets. So avalanche can eventually horizontally scale where you have all these different types of vms. You could have like a Solana VM, you could have any other chain that I guess needs scalability solutions to work. And also interoperate is kind of like the next step.
00:08:24.414 - 00:09:00.070, Speaker B: So the focus for us has really been smart contract enabled applications. Defi was kind of the first area that we were tackling. And then nfts and gaming and social tokens. All these things started coming into the surface the last two, three years at least more strongly than ever before. And so now we've really broadened the scope and saying, all right, well, which application, it doesn't matter if it's DeFi or gaming, which one needs high performance blockchains. And I think in the future we're going to see probably some problems pop up that we have to figure out just from a scalability perspective, maybe also user experience. And right now, right as we've grown.
00:09:00.070 - 00:09:33.010, Speaker B: So mainnet launch was September 2020. Since then, just a quick stat. August this past summer, avalanche, if you were to use TVL as a metric, there was about 200 million total value locked on avalanche. Today we're at about 15 billion. So it's only been about four months and a lot of activity has been pouring into the ecosystem. So you're going to see a lot of different things that happen. And I think those are excellent learning opportunities for the team to figure out what the users also the developers want out of a platform that enables smart contracts.
00:09:33.670 - 00:10:12.186, Speaker D: Yeah, before I talk about what me and my team are involved with, I just want to say it's super dope to be on this panel because I think what you guys are building are just like super sick. Avalanche is a horizontally scalable modular blockchain. That's super dope. Ren is super important in terms of trustless bridges in this modular future. So super dope to be here. Yeah, I work at a entity called Ave companies, which is kind of a interesting, kind of weird way to describe it, but the reason why we call it that is because we are multi protocol. We want to be multi protocol.
00:10:12.186 - 00:11:18.322, Speaker D: And so obviously the most precious one and the most kind of relevant one to this conversation is the Ave protocol, which we built a few years ago as a kind of extension of EtH Len, which was built a few years back before that. But basically what it is is it's a liquidity protocol. And so it's basically a way for people to pool their assets and also borrow or take certain positions against those assets. And so a pretty standard use case is like someone is able to deposit their collateral from a crypto sense anywhere from the majors of stables to various wrap, BTC, run BTC ETH, various kind of wrap versions of ETH, and earn kind of yield against it. And where does that yield come from? It comes from people who are actually interested in borrowing it, whether they want to go long something in terms of leverage, or they want to go short against a position, or they just want liquidity against your collateral. And so, yeah, we're also on avalanche super fortunate. We have $3 billion of TLV there TVL, and then we're total.
00:11:18.322 - 00:11:53.918, Speaker D: I think we're about at a certain point. I think we're 25 right now, but at a certain point we were at 30 billion TVL. So that was really cool. And then why did I start with the weird ave companies kind of preface? It's because we're the first organization that I'm proud of to be building multiple protocols. And so we're working on a social media protocol for what web3 social looks like in a crypto native sense. I also run a team called Newt, which is our experiments arm. And so we're kind of pushing the forefront of novel NFTs and zero knowledge scaling with computation, scaling with MEV searchers, and kind of improving that experience.
00:11:53.918 - 00:12:06.420, Speaker D: And so, yeah, that's kind of what we're doing in a nutshell, in addition to a bunch of other crap like nfts as collateral and, yeah, a lot of stuff. So we're having fun in Aave companies.
00:12:06.870 - 00:12:19.974, Speaker A: Awesome. A big reason that we throw these events is to educate people more about how Chainlink is used. We are agnostic. So I'd love to hear from you guys how Chainlink is implemented into your technologies. Happy to start. Same.
00:12:20.092 - 00:12:40.526, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So we use chainlink for actually two very important things. First, oracles for our assets. So if we have renbtC on a particular blockchain, we need basically an oracle for that asset. So we use those for all of our assets. I think now we have 25 in total that we bridge. So we'll be using chain link for all those.
00:12:40.526 - 00:13:10.166, Speaker C: So thank you, guys. Thank you. And then second of all, we have something called proof of reserve. So back to describing how RenvM works to bridge an asset to another blockchain. We custodial the asset. So we take bitcoin, we custodial it, and then mint a one for one representation on Ethereum, for example. And so proof of reserve is actually this product that essentially pings our wallet, essentially, that says, okay, renvm, the protocol has x amount of bitcoin in it.
00:13:10.166 - 00:13:21.100, Speaker C: So you can always verify that it actually has one to one custodialship of the assets that are bridged across various blockchains. So, yeah, it goes without saying, but Chainlink has been great. So appreciate it, guys.
00:13:22.190 - 00:13:22.710, Speaker A: Jay?
00:13:22.790 - 00:13:58.940, Speaker B: Yeah, I think with us, it's a little bit different. It's more for the applications that are building on avalanche. So it's basically oracle function for those applications. What's actually funny is I can't remember when Chainlink went live on avalanche main net, but there were probably 1015 projects that we were working with directly from the avalabs team who are saying, all right, well, we can't deploy, actually until chain link is live. So I think you guys actually were part of them, too. I can't remember exactly, but that's kind of the basic function there. I know there's a few other products that are coming online, so hopefully we can get those integrated, and again, mostly for the application side.
00:13:59.470 - 00:14:00.410, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:14:00.560 - 00:14:00.874, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:00.912 - 00:14:55.274, Speaker D: Chainlink is a super important partner. When we think about the Aave protocol ongoing multi chain in collaboration, know amongst the other contributors in the protocol ecosystem. And we kind of use it for two main reasons. The first one is, obviously, we use it for price feeds. And so when you think about this two sided liquidity pool, and there are people collateralizing their crypto and taking positions in a different currency on top of it, there needs to be a price feed in order to determine what is the liquidation threshold or what is like the loan to value ratio in order for it to be a good debt. Right. And so without getting too much into it, a lot of crypto kind of liquidity primitives use a chain leak in order to have this healthy ratio between how much you collateralize versus how much you borrow against it.
00:14:55.274 - 00:15:20.334, Speaker D: So that's kind of the main use case. And then when we think about it from an experiments perspective, I think VRF is a really interesting use case. When you think about raffles or general randomization of how you want to distribute whatever kind of reward or whatever kind of gamification element you want to add to the experiment. So those are kind of like the two ways that we use chainlink and, yeah, it's a super helpful tool and partner to be as we think about going multi chain.
00:15:20.462 - 00:15:32.230, Speaker A: Yep. We appreciate you using us. Thank you. And Jimmy, just to stick with you, would you mind explaining a little bit about your cross chain strategy? Why did you decide to go to polygon avalanche from Ethereum?
00:15:32.970 - 00:16:24.306, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'm laughing because I'm not really like the person that was like, let's do know, and they kind of made it happen. But how we view it at Ave is we are definitely EVM Maxis, we support EVM. We think it is definitely a very important foundation for building in web3 and crypto broadly. And so within that kind of space, what makes sense from a user need and a liquidity perspective and an ecosystem perspective in order to actually be very valuable in those different chains. And so for us right now, we're deployed on three chains. We're on Ethereum, Mainnet, we're on avalanche, and we're on polygon. And in the future, we're going to use the same framework in order to assess.
00:16:24.306 - 00:16:28.162, Speaker D: Okay, what does it make sense to go to another EVM compatible chain?
00:16:28.306 - 00:16:43.718, Speaker A: Definitely. Well said. Let's jump over to. Let's talk about avalanche labs. So when somebody else wants to build on you, are there any red lights? You get nervous, or is it just green lights? Full steam ahead, ready to go work the integration?
00:16:43.894 - 00:17:19.426, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, at the end of the day, permissionless blockchains, you can't really have control over what gets deployed. So all things considered, it is like anyone should be deploying if they want to. At least when it comes to the avalabs engagement, what we're really looking for are some of the novel new applications that aren't, I guess, kind of like the repeat of the past. And so the reason why that's important is because we're still really early to the game. So only been about a year and change on mainnet. A lot of the early apps that came on board were the ones that existed on Ethereum, were the ones that existed on other chains.
00:17:19.426 - 00:18:10.274, Speaker B: And so that's where I think we started to build up the base. Once the base has been built, then a lot of these applications who are saying, all right, well, we actually need a fast chain to function at all and haven't really deployed on any chain, those are the kind of ones that we want to engage. So that's where I think our BD team marketing has a place. I think everyone actually has a hand in this too, for what it's worth. But we're always talking these products and applications, saying, what's your end goal? If you want to bootstrap development, then maybe the foundation could be helping you guys with funding or marketing or something in between. But if there's something where it's like maybe it's users and retail traders, maybe there's a broader story to be told here. So actually, with you guys, with Ave and a few other Ethereum native apps at the time, we ran this incentive program called Avalanche Rush.
00:18:10.274 - 00:18:49.846, Speaker B: The way I describe it to people that don't necessarily know the crypto space, it's kind of like when Uber and Lyft came to the cities and started to give everybody those free rides. That's where we're at now. And when I get asked, hey, do you think, well, once the well dries up, then does everyone leave? Well, everyone will leave only if the UX and the product experience was bad. And so they came in for the money and they'll leave. But if there's actually something there that's useful for the user, whether that's high performance, low cost, or something, it could even be as nontechnical as community, or it could be something like the color of the token. It really could be as silly as that. And I think that's what's going to get the users to stay.
00:18:49.846 - 00:18:56.694, Speaker B: And I think once the incentive programs kind of start tapering away, you'll see that the strong base starts shining through.
00:18:56.892 - 00:19:10.810, Speaker A: Awesome. So, Ren, a question for you. So, since you're the early pioneer of making the token bridges possible, what are some lessons that you've learned that you could share with everybody here as these projects they might find valuable as this becomes a continuous trend?
00:19:11.550 - 00:19:36.690, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. And yeah, we've had to build a lot of things ourselves. I think there's two, just because there wasn't precedence before, and I think that's taken us a long time, and then we've learned a lot as a result. But I think two things stand out. First is node infrastructure. So we're bridging assets that are outside of the EVM world. So we need to run either a full node or an RPC endpoint for bitcoin.
00:19:36.690 - 00:20:08.234, Speaker C: All the legacy assets we support, zcash, Filecoin, all these guys have their own node infrastructures. So for us to actually operate, we need to build these essentially node infrastructure in house for it to work. And that's taken us a lot of time. As well as blockchains that are outside of the EVM. More like Solana, for example. We've had to again, build our own in house blockchain infrastructure for that. So it's been difficult because no third party provided those services like inferior was just Ethereum.
00:20:08.234 - 00:20:46.038, Speaker C: And now there's block Damon and a few others that are providing kind of these services across the board. But that's just coming about, and they still don't support all the blockchains that we do. So, yeah, we've had to build everything in house. So if you want to go outside of EVM, be prepared to do it in house or lean on a third party service. And I think something to keep in mind, at least for us, you have to trust them explicitly if you use a third party, because they can kind of like spoof transactions. And then that would actually trigger Ren to mint an arbitrary amount of an asset that actually isn't there if someone spoofed a transaction. So it's tricky.
00:20:46.038 - 00:21:11.140, Speaker C: And you have to basically trust these guys explicitly if you do use a third party. So that's definitely something to keep in mind. If you move outside of the. Yeah, for cross chain, that's definitely something to keep in mind. And then number two would be ux. And especially, again, outside of know you're sending bitcoin in and you want to mint it on Solana. And it's have.
00:21:11.140 - 00:21:47.534, Speaker C: There's just so many issues. Basically, if a user can screw it up, they will. And we've had to basically refine our product in a way that it's like, step one, only do this. Step two, only do this and make it wicked simple for the end user or otherwise they'll screw it up. So making sure Ux is as clean and as simple as possible in the cross chain world is so important. We've had to scale our own customer service team just to deal with the inquiries we get. They're like, oh, I've sent in bitcoin and I saw gas was $100, so I rejected it.
00:21:47.534 - 00:22:15.240, Speaker C: Now my bitcoin is gone, what do I do? And we're like, oh, God. Yeah. We have an ability to resolve that, but nonetheless, it happens all the time, and especially for new users. So you really need to think about the user experience and making it as foolproof as possible when you're working in the cross chain space. So, yeah, node infrastructure and dead simple Ux are two things you definitely need to keep in mind.
00:22:15.610 - 00:23:11.990, Speaker D: Maybe just quickly to add, because it's really interesting that we have literally four different things that all work together in order to make it work. And so just like they expound on my answer earlier, tooling is so important when we think about going multichain, right? And so me, we're working on building and making improvements to a smart contract protocol. Then we have a blockchain protocol, and then we have a bridging infrastructure in a decentralized manner. And then we have oracles, right? Those all need to work together in order to actually work. So it's cool to have it all come together because without that, without even the graph for ave protocols perspective, to have good indexing for data we can't deploy. Right. So that's super important for everyone to realize that we're all working together to make sure thriving ecosystems happen in various places.
00:23:12.650 - 00:23:29.674, Speaker A: Definitely does. Anybody? That's all the questions I have for right now. Do you guys have anything to add or sum up with? Otherwise, we'll jump to the Q A. Just wanted to thank you. It's awesome to be on stage with you guys. These are pioneers of the industry. I went from being kind of a crypto cheerleader to working full time in it now, and it's incredible.
00:23:29.674 - 00:23:41.380, Speaker A: And I look forward to working together, change the world. So with that said, we're going to open it up to Q A, but I would love it if last night got a little rowdy. So if we could keep it to one question, that would be great.
00:23:44.070 - 00:23:46.466, Speaker E: So for the Q A to get.
00:23:46.488 - 00:23:55.490, Speaker C: The most people possible, please keep it to one question and one answer. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to ask the panelists after the panel.
00:23:55.570 - 00:23:56.360, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:23:58.510 - 00:24:30.978, Speaker C: Hey, what are your favorite projects for cross chain bridges? What was the question? What are your favorite projects that you are watching for cross chain bridges? Tokens. Yeah. So, I mean, there's us, obviously, I'm a little biased, but yeah, outside of RenVM, I mean, there's a lot of great products coming out. I mean, hop protocol looks really cool in their UX. They're doing the Ux very well and we appreciate anyswap. You know, those guys are doing great things. They've done a fair amount of volume within the EVM space.
00:24:30.978 - 00:24:39.800, Speaker C: So those are two guys that we definitely keep an eye out on. Yeah, they have great ux, and it's something we want to learn from.
00:24:42.730 - 00:25:28.680, Speaker D: I really like layer zero. They're really interesting because they have this novel structure of having oracles and relayers, basically push block headers and also push transaction data on demand, basically to different protocols. And so you don't have to run full nodes in order to have trustless communication. So very early days for it. But I think that's going to open up way more potential for bridges because the requirement to run either a full node or have like a super expensive light node becomes vastly, vastly smaller. So super dope stuff.
00:25:29.450 - 00:26:13.940, Speaker B: Yeah, and maybe for me, I just looked at layer zero like last week, funny enough, but optics I've been looking at as well, they're out of cello, cello labs. The main thing that I care about and I don't have a technical development background is something that makes it really easy but also secure. So like what Michael said, if a user can make that mistake, then they're going to make it. So I basically go through from the experience side and then go into the documentation of how that works then, and basically ask probably half the room here how this actually works on the hood. So if all those checkboxes are checked off, then I think that's a viable product. But even then, you don't really have that provability until it's live. So that's kind of the risk of the space that we're in.
00:26:14.550 - 00:26:18.454, Speaker A: Awesome. A lot of alpha there. Any other questions?
00:26:18.652 - 00:27:16.920, Speaker B: Quick question for Ava labs for a sec. Don't worry. So as there's all these different main nets out there, like between Phantom Harmony one like avalanche, Solana, what's the biggest differentiating factor of avalanche to bring on new users relative to all these other chains? Yeah, I think the biggest one that we've been leaning on is transaction finality. I think there's going to be a certain point in time where transaction finality speeds from a consensus level will be at just such an undifferentiated time, I guess horizon where under a second the human is not going to really feel that difference. So I think right now we're really taking advantage of that because most of the other blockchains are pushing 520 seconds or greater than that. That's kind of the first one, maybe the other angle, and I've actually talked to a bunch of friends at Salana about this as well, is Salana and Avalanche. The way we're structured, we have a core team that's building the product right now or the platform.
00:27:16.920 - 00:27:56.550, Speaker B: The way it's centralized, I think actually is a strength in a way because you're able to communicate, coordinate with your team members as a proper company as opposed to, I don't know, early days of a dow. How does that really work? Also having it super remote. I'm actually totally fine with that. But also add some complexities as well with time zone differences and stuff. So you'll see from both teams just kind of the pace at which we're attacking the market because it is so competitive is actually at a really high rate. And I really do believe that's just because of the traditional structure that we've kind of gone towards, at least in the beginning.
00:27:57.850 - 00:28:09.500, Speaker A: Thank you. I know there's a question in the front, somebody in the back. First we can give it to Sean, and then we can go in the back.
00:28:13.550 - 00:28:56.742, Speaker F: My name is Deshaun Budso, National League Sport Coin. I'm a founder. I actually created a sport league based on biometrics, using blockchain hardware or whatever to discover athletes, and then also collecting, tracking, measuring athletic data on blockchains. So my question to you guys today is, based on regulatory. What do you feel about regulatory today, and where do you think things are going? Because I'm a founder, I just started this company in 2018. I'm going on four years right now. I'm still looking for c capital, and they're talking about killing cryptocurrency, if anybody.
00:28:56.796 - 00:28:58.774, Speaker A: Feels comfortable answering any questions about it.
00:28:58.812 - 00:29:41.154, Speaker C: Yeah. Happy at a high level, and I mean, I'm obviously not a lawyer, but at a high level, I think all of us were at the protocol level, so we're really just running the kind of transaction layer. So all of us have products that are built on top of our protocols. So we'll have applications that do have KYC, and these are the front ends, these are the websites that actually users interact with that they'll be in a particular jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction requires that they do have KYC for whatever reason. And that can be built on top of our protocol. I mean, we're just basically crunching the numbers, I guess, is a good way to put it. And so we're agnostic, essentially, from a regulatory perspective.
00:29:41.154 - 00:30:13.986, Speaker C: You can have a product that doesn't have KYC or a product that does have KYC, and it can all be built on top of our protocol at least. I mean, I can speak to our protocol at least, but I think the same applies to you guys as well. I know Ave has allowed a product that does have KYC and one that doesn't. And I think that's the way of the know. You can't really skirt regulation. It would be silly to think you can. So building a flexible system that can function in both worlds, I think, is the most crucial thing you can do.
00:30:13.986 - 00:30:14.900, Speaker C: Moving forward.
00:30:15.910 - 00:30:16.820, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:30:19.030 - 00:30:46.540, Speaker B: Hi, my name is Andy. I don't know if this question pertains to any of you guys can answer it, but regarding cross chain value and interoperability, can you elaborate more on NFTs as collateral and D five 2.0? Sorry, what was the second part? Eth 2.0. Oh, D five 2.0.
00:30:50.160 - 00:31:37.390, Speaker D: Yeah, I can talk about that. Sorry, I don't quite get the question. Maybe it's like a little too broad, but I will interpret it the way that I can. DeFi is the foundation of what we're building. It is as foundational as any blockchain protocol or any decentralized bridging mechanism or any roll up. Why is that the case? Because we're going to have an app layer that is going to look very different than, I think, what we're familiar with today. And so right now we have apps that are basically very simply using the smart contract functions that we have, at least in Ave's example, or even for uniswap or compound or anything like that.
00:31:37.390 - 00:32:37.936, Speaker D: And what's going to happen is you don't have to do that one to one. You can actually build an application layer that is able to leverage that within your own use case, and you can own the design and user experience. And so what does that look like in the world of nfTs? And what does that look like in the world of games and gaming economies and Dow ecosystems, dow to Dow swaps, treasury management? At the end of the day, people want to earn yield, people want liquidity, people want to swap between different assets. And to have a vision of an open liquidity order book, for lack of better terms, is super important. And you can tag in that different ways. And so, sorry, that was kind of a weird preface, but basically, to answer your question, nfts will play to that, right? Eventually, you want liquidity for nfts, either want collateralize it or you want to swap it. You want to earn yield, you want to use it the same way as you use an ERC 20 or a similar token in this DFI ecosystem that we're building right now.
00:32:37.936 - 00:32:59.290, Speaker D: And so that's how I view it, and that's something that we're marching towards at Ave, is building that connection layer as a reference implementation for a bunch of other people to also do that so that people are not down bad on their illiquid jpegs and they can actually get some liquidity for it. Right. So that's really important on DFI 2.0. I mean, DFI 2.0 is like interesting marketing for basically an idea of.
00:33:01.740 - 00:33:02.056, Speaker B: How.
00:33:02.078 - 00:33:31.772, Speaker D: Do you improve upon the incentive experimentation that we've had so far with DFI 1.0 or DFI summer last year with liquidity mining and yield farming and stuff like that. Right. So how do you have protocol owned liquidity? Or how do you have amm owned liquidity? And also other novel ways of basically incentivizing people to not dump their bags. Right. For lack of a better term. And so how does that play into this world that I'm picturing? It pictures a world where it's like liquidity isn't mercenary and is predictable.
00:33:31.772 - 00:34:02.436, Speaker D: Right. You have a set idea of what your slippage or what your access to certain assets are going to be. Especially as we have a long tail of more tokens for gaming economies or nfts that are way more illiquid and have different kind of risk curves than a standard kind of ERC 20 token. And so that's how I think it plays into it. And I think a lot of people are experimenting on what that looks like, whether it be protocol owned liquidity with Olympus and all its a million forks, or it's with liquidity mining 2.0 that Andre Cronier proposed with option liquidity mining.
00:34:02.548 - 00:34:03.210, Speaker B: Or.
00:34:04.940 - 00:34:17.570, Speaker D: Like liquidity mining 3.0, which has to do with coverage protocols and insurance premiums. So everyone's experimenting on this, but I think we're all marching towards the same beat of the drum of like, we need to fix this. This is not the right vision that we're trying to march towards.
00:34:18.100 - 00:34:20.450, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, one more question.
00:34:21.700 - 00:34:23.696, Speaker E: Hi, can you hear me?
00:34:23.798 - 00:34:24.932, Speaker A: Good, we can hear you.
00:34:24.986 - 00:34:51.068, Speaker E: Hey, my name is crypto Excel and I have a question for Ren, but a general question across the broad about decentralization in bridging, specifically in Ren, is it Shamir's key sharding or is it a full multiparty compute? And if it's the former and not the latter, then how is the original key generated? Because I have some questions about the centralization around the generation of that key.
00:34:51.234 - 00:35:24.256, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. Yeah. So we use secret sharing and SMPC as well, in unison to actually generate the keys. So you take in an asset like bitcoin and basically renvium. The network custodials that and then breaks up. Basically the simple way to think about it is it breaks up the private key into small little pieces. And then anytime renvium wants to mint or burn or spend an asset, it reconvenes that key and then the network is given permission to spend the asset, and that's absolutely crucial to our vision.
00:35:24.256 - 00:36:02.512, Speaker C: And we've taken particular caution to actually implementing that in the long run, because, as you've seen, things get hacked all the time. If you rush that type of stuff, you can get hacked if you make a mistake. We've seen the keep network and TBDC. They made a mistake in one of the original lines of code, and they actually had to kind of, like, reboot their protocol. So we've been very cautious. And then the plan we take is something called progressive decentralization. So we're testing a few nodes running at a time, then we open it up to a larger set of the public, and then eventually it's opened up to even the general public.
00:36:02.512 - 00:36:17.670, Speaker C: So anyone in the world can run a node that runs SMPC and the Shamir secret sharing portion of the protocol. We've got jazz here, actually, our CTO, and so he'd be glad to speak to you about that after this as well. Thank you.
00:36:18.040 - 00:36:22.600, Speaker A: All right, I have one question for Jimmy. Do I have to go to rave to get one of those hats?
00:36:23.340 - 00:36:24.090, Speaker D: Yes.
00:36:24.780 - 00:36:35.476, Speaker A: Understood. Thank you, guys, for all coming out. I know there's a million things you could be doing tonight, but you're here with us, learning how to build, so I thank you for that. Everybody enjoy their night, and I'll see you at Defi con tomorrow.
00:36:35.668 - 00:37:00.560, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you, guys. It's.
