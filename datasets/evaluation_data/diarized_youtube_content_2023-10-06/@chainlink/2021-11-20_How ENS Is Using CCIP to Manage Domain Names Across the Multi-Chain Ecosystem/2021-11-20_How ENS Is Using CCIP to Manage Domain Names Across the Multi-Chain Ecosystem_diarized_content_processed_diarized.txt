00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.866, Speaker A: ENS is unique among many other protocols. A lot of people say, like, well, why don't you just put it on arbitrum or, like, uniswap, just like, put itself on arbitram. Okay. ENS is a naming system, and by its very nature, you need a single source of truth. Like, this is the whole point of a naming system, so we can't just create copies everywhere. This wouldn't work, so we have to do this very carefully. The first step is we're using a system that we developed that was now called Ccipree, that we're doing in conjunction with chain link, that will allow you to put records in subdomains on the external location of your choice.
00:00:30.866 - 00:00:52.620, Speaker A: So right now, everything's on Ethereum layer one. But you'll be able to use this to put it on an L two, like optimism or arbitrum or something on another layer one, like Salana or whatever you want, or even a non blockchain place like a server. This could make setting records and the creation of subdomains either very cheap or even zero cost.
