00:00:00.410 - 00:01:10.274, Speaker A: Our goal is to enable that shift in how smart contracts are used for things beyond tokenization, basically. So our goal is to take our industry, the blockchain industry, into the new world of decentralized financial products, decentralized insurance, decentralized global trade, fraud proof ad networks, fraud proof gaming. And I don't think it's a coincidence that decentralized financial products are taking off when there's better and better oracle mechanisms and abstraction layers like ours. I think it's all very connected because even in our case we have cases where users came to us, were able to integrate in a number of weeks, didn't have to build infrastructure just like they didn't have to build a blockchain, didn't have to build an abstraction layer, didn't have to build an oracle mechanism, which is a serious set of security and computer science problems. And we have other users who are able to rapidly launch new markets because we can provide new data to them for them to launch new defi markets in the derivatives category. And we're very proud that we have something to do with that. So we don't really view it as like here's this business and that type of thing.
00:01:10.274 - 00:01:42.780, Speaker A: We're very lucky to be in a position where we can for the long term build an open source product. We have the resources to do that. We're very lucky to have those resources. We're able to deploy those resources to build an open source standard which is being adopted more and more as a standard. And the goal of our team and our group of people and our body of work is to change what smart contracts are about, to essentially redefine this industry from tokens and exchanges to everything else.
