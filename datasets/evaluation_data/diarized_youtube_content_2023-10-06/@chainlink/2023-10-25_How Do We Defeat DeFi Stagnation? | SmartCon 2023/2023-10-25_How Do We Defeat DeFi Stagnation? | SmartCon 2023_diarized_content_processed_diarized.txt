00:00:00.730 - 00:00:01.134, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:00:01.172 - 00:00:01.774, Speaker B: We'll find out.
00:00:01.812 - 00:00:03.040, Speaker C: Am I in the right place?
00:00:04.370 - 00:00:05.486, Speaker A: That's the correct number.
00:00:05.588 - 00:00:20.106, Speaker C: All right. Hey, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I have my Defi boys up here. My name is Christy moscoso. I am from Chainlink Labs. I'm actually one of the ecosystem managers there, and I actually manage a lot of our Defi relationships.
00:00:20.106 - 00:00:41.774, Speaker C: Thank you all for joining me here today. I'm excited to talk about how do we defeat Defi stagnation. Obviously, we're in a bear, so I think this is a good conversation. I met some of these guys yesterday over some coffee and had a great combo there. So excited to kick this off. I'll let you guys introduce yourselves. So maybe we could start with you, Kristoff.
00:00:41.842 - 00:00:42.266, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:42.368 - 00:00:49.370, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. I'm Christophe Fontano, one of the founding members at Request finance handing the strategy and partnerships.
00:00:50.670 - 00:00:57.070, Speaker A: My name is iham, I'm one of the founding contributors of Silo Finance. Silo implements risk isolated lending markets.
00:00:57.410 - 00:01:00.880, Speaker B: I work at premium. My name is Caesar, and I run BD over there.
00:01:01.330 - 00:01:04.770, Speaker E: Hi, my name is Jack. I lead Defi at Polygon Labs.
00:01:05.190 - 00:01:13.410, Speaker F: Hi, my name is antonio, I'm the founder of Hourglass. We offer derivative protected term loans.
00:01:15.130 - 00:01:25.750, Speaker C: Thanks. And I figured I'll start at the top. Right, let's define stagnation. What does that mean to you guys? Is that something you have seen in Defi?
00:01:27.790 - 00:01:29.020, Speaker D: I'm going to start.
00:01:29.950 - 00:01:30.700, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:31.070 - 00:02:18.166, Speaker D: Yes, we've seen stagnation, and we can define stagnation as a long period of slow growth. And since 2021, like Defi summer, we've seen this slow growth, including like the TvL in DeFi has dropped by 80%. Volume on centralized and decentralized exchanges has dropped roughly by 60%. And it's the 7th quarter, consecutive 7th quarter, where the investment in web three startups is decreasing. So I guess we're stagnating at the moment.
00:02:18.348 - 00:03:35.762, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think definitely everyone agrees that there is a stagnation. We're not seeing a lot of capital flowing into DeFi, actually. In fact, we're seeing capital outflowing DeFi because the interest rate and try is very competitive, and yield in DeFi is no longer a competitive one, considering the risk you take, including smart contract risk. But I think that also could be a sign of that. We are at a point where there's some problems we need to fix, structural problems, mainly about regulations, so we can start aiming at basically next leg of growth on a DeFi level. So, yeah, as a developer in the space, as someone leading a project, I think stagnation means that there are certain measures need to be taken on a project level as far as extending your Runway, trying to compete and get more funds into our protocol. But if the space with DeFi, we're all on Ethereum at our project, if Ethereum doesn't grow, we don't really benefit from that benefit that much.
00:03:35.762 - 00:03:45.518, Speaker A: So there's a lot of measures that I think every project needs to take to kind of mitigate just to keep growing.
00:03:45.614 - 00:04:40.994, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going to take a different approach. I think we're not really being stagnant right now, like you said, defined or whatever, but it's kind of fun right now. If you have a little bit of money to be able to survive right now, you get to try a whole bunch of new things. You get to try to experiment, you get to try to find product market fit in a really rough time. And if you're able to do that, when the bull or better times come, everything's going to be a lot better for us. At premium, we do options and we're always looking at how much volume we're turning over, how much volatility is going on, that kind of stuff. And we're able to now iterate and look at how do we start to work with institutions, how do we start to keep retail engaged and all that kind of stuff, and not going to say we wouldn't have done these things or been as tactful in it if it was a bull market, but being in the bear lets us really hone down, look at what's going to happen, look at what our users are asking for, look at what we think the market is going to be having and take a breath.
00:04:40.994 - 00:04:47.238, Speaker B: So it's like stagnation is, yes, the market sucks, but the community is really pushing things forward.
00:04:47.404 - 00:04:49.480, Speaker C: I love that opportunity, man.
00:04:50.250 - 00:04:51.618, Speaker B: Half class pool.
00:04:51.794 - 00:06:08.514, Speaker E: I'll take a little bit of a different lens, too, I guess, coming from the ecosystem side rather than the builder side directly for us. I think one of the biggest things I saw on the stagnation side, the top of the line numbers are always going to be kind of cyclical. The bigger thing was in terms of types of projects, right when you're kind of on the way up in a bull market and everything's fun and exciting, the reason that's kind of getting driven is because every project is really looking at a problem in a completely novel way. And towards the end of 2022, the vast majority of what I was seeing were protocols that were looking to kind of what felt like squeeze the last drops out of the cycle, they were looking to create a version of a primitive that had already existed with very, very minor tweaks. And that was really what felt like stagnation was actually like the idea flow and the way that projects were actually thinking about solving issues. And then today, where I'm really starting to feel it is the new wins, right? Is people saying what worked last cycle, what mechanisms work, what token design worked, what failed to find product market fit? And where can I actually iterate and create entirely new mechanism design to serve a better purpose and to serve a different purpose? And I think that's the answer for me of how you defeat DeFi stagnation is don't get locked into the box of what was possible. Think proactively about what you can do moving forward.
00:06:08.632 - 00:06:29.334, Speaker C: Well, that's it. He gave us the answer. So I like that. So I feel like you kind of brought up a good point where there's stagnation from two places, there's stagnation from the market side, and then there's also stagnation in the more creative side of things. Right. Where that actually happens more in the bull market. I like that, Antonio.
00:06:29.462 - 00:06:33.786, Speaker F: Yeah, I guess everyone answered everything. There's nothing left for me to say.
00:06:33.968 - 00:06:35.930, Speaker C: We'll start with you next, don't worry.
00:06:36.910 - 00:07:42.560, Speaker F: But I am on the camp of being more kind of optimistic about the fact that we are actually in this bear market and we don't have to be distracted by having to chase a bull market. And it really gives us the ability to iterate on the product, to sort of think outside the box, think really how we want to design the customer experience as well as the infrastructure layer. And I think actually that having this ability to sort of just take a step back and look at things from first principles is actually going to pay off in the future. We are in a massive building phase. I think the stagnation or the bull market is, or the bear market is really in terms of markets, but in terms of building, I think things are really actually ramping up. There's a lot of building in the space. There's a lot of talent coming into the space.
00:07:42.560 - 00:07:58.290, Speaker F: I attend a lot of these hackathons to basically scout for talent, to find people and to meet people, network in the space. And the amount of stuff that's actually happening, especially in Defi, is incredible.
00:07:58.630 - 00:08:00.286, Speaker C: Yeah. You felt that this weekend.
00:08:00.398 - 00:08:01.060, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:08:01.450 - 00:08:38.174, Speaker A: There isn't a short of talent. I think now it's a time of again facing the problems. I think we've treated Defi as this island and we can build this utopia. And now we're discovering that we just actually kind of like another cog in this machine and we're leverage machine for tradfi. And I'm not honestly a fan of tradfi, but now we are at that crossroad. We have to find ways to integrate and bring that capital frontfi. A lot of projects actually spearheading that and like tokenizing real world assets.
00:08:38.174 - 00:09:20.922, Speaker A: I think that's how we bring, we improve our yield on Defi and how we actually onboard the next batch of users and I mean really here institutional users because probably more suitable for that. So that's actually the biggest challenge we see. But that will take time. Again, legal needs to be sorted out and we're actually now in the battle. It's not really about optimism, pessimism, it's about realism, what needs to be done, what should be done. And I think every l one needs to kind of like chip in and help in that fight. But on a Dap level, on a builder level, builder's level, we need to survive.
00:09:20.922 - 00:09:42.454, Speaker A: We need to survive. We need to make sure we have money, we need to keep building, we need to manage the community's expectation as far as the token price and also shipping. And also the community needs to know that to survive we need to innovate and this innovation will opens up to risk. Basically you innovate and your product doesn't work.
00:09:42.492 - 00:10:12.560, Speaker C: That's a great segue into what I was going to ask you guys next, actually, which is strategy wise, right? Like, okay, we are in this landscape, it's slower, good or bad, this is what we're dealt right now. So I'd love to hear from each of you and Jack, maybe, actually I promised Antonio we would start with you, so I'll let you start. Maybe we come this way, but I'd love to hear from you guys where you are with strategy. I feel like you already kind of answered that. And from Jack, it'll be really interesting to know since you're not actually.
00:10:13.830 - 00:11:07.710, Speaker F: Anyway, yeah, I think at the stage where we are now, we need to be realistic about what DeFi is going to look like in the long run. I think that regulation is going to play a big part on that. So regulation is going to shape a lot of what this industry is going to look like in the long run. I mean, there is no scenario in which governments are just going to accept some platform on the Internet which does no KYC and performs all these transactions. And we have to be really kind of realistic about that. So regulation is coming. I think there is still a big gap between the current infrastructure and what we offer and what the next billion users are going to require.
00:11:07.710 - 00:11:52.186, Speaker F: Right. So I think we still need to figure out the user experience. A lot of people are not going to deal with seed phrases, wallets. So I think in terms of strategy, going down the institutional route is probably going to make a lot of sense. I think what's going to happen is the end client is going to want to delegate this to the professionals, and you're going to see asset managers and wealth managers then become the layer that specializes in using Defi and taking care of all the operational risk. The end client just wants to know that they can sue someone if something goes wrong, essentially. And I think that's kind of how this is going to be shaped.
00:11:52.186 - 00:12:07.330, Speaker F: A lot of the institutional layer of tradfi is going to become, let's say the first adopters of the next billion people to join DeFi and then therefore kind of offer these products to the masses.
00:12:08.070 - 00:12:58.162, Speaker E: Super interesting. I think for me, and I guess for us broadly at Polygon, the way that we're thinking about DeFi strategy is focusing on a few really kind of select points. Right now, we're aware that the market is slow, but that's really an opportunity to kind of put on your vc hat weirdly and find projects that you think are doing things and thinking about things in a really differentiated way, and try and just get in the trenches with them, understand not just what they're building, but why they're trying to build it. How you can iterate on mechanism design, getting a cohesive understanding of your ecosystem and creating relationships between builders to create novel product that can exist either only in your ecosystem or only in blockchain. Broadly. And I think to some of these other points around tokenization and real world assets and all these other things, I totally agree. But I think the way that it really has to be structured is a bit different than a lot of people are thinking.
00:12:58.162 - 00:13:46.702, Speaker E: Right? And so taking a quick example of something like t bills, right, why are t bills successful on chain, even though they offer the risk free rate in air quotes here of 5%, when in fact you're taking on extra risk on chain? It's because stablecoins are a massive liquidity sink in crypto and the organic rate for stables on chain is lower than the rate off chain. And so because of that there's a real use case for deploying capital into those assets. But at the same time, we've seen almost every other tokenized asset on chain fail to gain any traction whatsoever. And that's because there's a fundamental mismatch right now between the people that are actually consuming these assets on chain and the providers. And so what's the solution there? It's finding these pockets of product that are highly differentiated and serve areas of traditionally unbanked people in some capacity.
00:13:46.766 - 00:13:47.138, Speaker F: Right.
00:13:47.224 - 00:14:09.642, Speaker E: Whether it's helping dollarize regions in emerging markets so they can gain savings, exposure and access to cheaper lending rates than they could ever get in their lending markets or any of these other facilities where you can connect large capital to products that functionally were impossible for them to access. From like a risk and compliance perspective in legacy markets, that's kind of the sweet spot for early access. And what does that do?
00:14:09.696 - 00:14:10.106, Speaker F: Right.
00:14:10.208 - 00:15:02.940, Speaker E: It really allows these groups to kind of dip their toes into blockchain in a mechanism and in a product suite that they understand. And by doing that, you really kind of simplify the user experience on both the high level onboarding and as well on the ground by connecting these products together. And that's like a big part of, I guess, what we're trying to do at Polygon broadly, right, is I think we're very well known for our very large kind of enterprise presence. But at the same time, I spend a lot of time working with that enterprise bd team to try and connect the dots. Like when you're working with Nike and Starbucks and Reddit and all these very big players, they have very different demands than when I'm working with Caesar and iham on the defi side. But at the end of the day, our goal is really to connect these two sides of the funnel together. And the way you do that is by kind of proactively solving for product that people didn't know they need while showing them things that they're comfortable with to get started.
00:15:04.610 - 00:15:05.550, Speaker B: That was really good.
00:15:05.620 - 00:15:11.338, Speaker C: Yeah, seriously, I feel like there's a lot about the marriage of trad in this conversation.
00:15:11.434 - 00:15:33.878, Speaker B: Yeah, it's actually kind of fun because the theme for DFI in general right now is bring on Tradfi, bring on tradfi, bring on tradfi. And it's like counterintuitive to what we used to do in 2021, basically before this year. And so it's funny when we're is talking about strategies like bring on tradfi, build things for tradfi. And we are doing that at premium. We are building RFQ networks, we are building order books. We're doing all this stuff to bring tradfi. Awesome.
00:15:33.878 - 00:16:11.202, Speaker B: But then also you have the, I think of the other bucket which you've been mentioning as well is the retail or people that are maybe not unbanked but are interested in crypto that aren't like big spenders. And I think of those people as they keep the lights on for us. So they're the ones that are trading, they're the ones that are doing things maybe on a smaller systematic level. And those are the people that helped us survive for premium for the past two and a half, three years now, which is something I love, that I was actually one of those users at one point. And building things for them is also just as important and making sure that you don't lose your initial base, people that you're working with. So for us, the strategy we've really employed is like educating. We have an amazing academy program.
00:16:11.202 - 00:16:36.646, Speaker B: Shout out to WECA and KB. They think they're in the audience right now. They did an amazing job getting people to go from zero options knowledge to a lot of options knowledge and being able to start trading. And it's been amazing over the past few months doing that. Then you have things at a bigger level where I was mentioned earlier, bringing the tradfi on, it's awesome. But that's a whole different category of what you have to build. The legacy time of working through people that are not usually on chain.
00:16:36.646 - 00:17:04.100, Speaker B: It's like educating them is very different because they know the derivatives but they don't know. You mentioned like Nike has different demands. Well, each fund has different demands of what they would like to see happen and how comfortably they are with being on chain. So there's all these little things you have to work through strategy. It's not like one size fits all for what we're doing and what most people, probably you guys as well, are doing. So it's really tough to be like we're going to bring tradfi but each individual agreement, deal, whatever, is going to be extremely different.
00:17:04.470 - 00:17:56.840, Speaker A: Are we allowed to do shout outs? Caesar? I think we should look at it differently. I think every single DAP or actually project manager like owner should think about profitability, revenue. How do we bring revenue once we start thinking and redefining our success metrics? Tvail is not a success metric. How much revenue is? Have you achieved product market fit? I think none of us have. Though if you look at it, revenue. So how do you bring revenue? If we think about that on the builders level and about surviving and actually making it sustainable business, which is actually we're all in the business of making revenue then everything shifts. Your roadmap shifts your product innovation the way you build products.
00:17:56.840 - 00:18:26.730, Speaker A: Actually, no one, for example, has asked Ethereum to kick back some of the fees they generate to the DAP level. No one has asked that, squire. We generate a lot of money. We accrue all the value to them, but they don't kick back anything to us. How do you survive then? You can't raise money becoming very complex. This fees that you generate is negligible. Every monthly fee barely covers the cost of infrastructure.
00:18:26.730 - 00:18:52.582, Speaker A: So how do you survive then? That's actually a big question to really on l ones. And I personally will ask our dow to deploy on any l one that kind of has any kind of a program to kick back some of the fees to developers. That's actually what they should do. So if you think about profitability, then it definitely makes sense to go and bridge to Trapfi, because it's actually where the money is, where the volume will come, it's where scalability is.
00:18:52.636 - 00:18:53.350, Speaker B: I have a question.
00:18:53.420 - 00:19:20.750, Speaker D: You're talking about market fit. What's true at the macro level? So like the stagnation and everything is not necessarily true at the micro level. I just give you some figures. I'm actually surprised. But at request, over. Since 2021, we process 400 million of receivables and payables for b two b payments in the industry. And good fact, the months of August.
00:19:20.750 - 00:19:26.690, Speaker D: Among those 400 millions, we processed 32 million just in August this year.
00:19:26.760 - 00:19:27.090, Speaker C: Wow.
00:19:27.160 - 00:20:23.410, Speaker D: Which was like 54% growth over the last month. And since like six months, we go like 20% to 40% monthly growth. And it's like, even if the market sucks, as you said before, even if the market is really low, we perceive that the underlying activity of web three is growing and the number of builders is growing every day. And we were discussing about Ethereum and polygon just before, just some facts. Ethereum is we process all the payments, 70% in stablecoins, but 71% of these payments actually occur on Ethereum. Whatever the fees are 14% on finance, BNB chain. Surprising, but it's a fact.
00:20:23.410 - 00:20:39.618, Speaker D: And only 8% on polygon. I personally use it every day, but the facts are like only 8% are on polygon. So the people are still processing all the majority of the payments on layer one, Ethereum.
00:20:39.714 - 00:20:59.786, Speaker B: I have a question, though. You mentioned earlier about you're like, I'm going to go wherever the money resides. So polygon has huge grants. Arbitram has, they do have huge grants right now. I think about that a lot of is it worth following that money? Or is it worth staying where you are and sticking to the user base because it's like a short term win versus a long term?
00:20:59.818 - 00:20:59.966, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:20:59.988 - 00:21:01.182, Speaker B: So how do you think about that?
00:21:01.236 - 00:21:04.430, Speaker A: If you don't make money, then what is it about?
00:21:04.500 - 00:21:07.534, Speaker B: Is it like the grant is the one making the money? Because you're this still.
00:21:07.572 - 00:21:19.030, Speaker A: No, it's a Dow. I mean, it's the Dow. I have a mandate to actually work, I work for the Dow. I have a mandate to make sure the Dow makes revenue and survive. That's my only mandate, actually.
00:21:19.100 - 00:21:34.714, Speaker B: Well, so, like in interoperability, I'm thinking about fragmenting a liquidity. It doesn't help us get product market fit, but it helps us maybe survive for another day. But are you guys starting to think about how do you bridge that liquidity? How do you make it so it doesn't matter what chain you're on?
00:21:34.752 - 00:21:54.510, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think isolated lending markets are perfect. What we do. Perfect for tokenized assets. Jack mentioned this mismatch between these two worlds. Well, yes, because if you create a permission token and no one can exchange it, you can't build pending markets, you can't build dexes and all that. So we have to fix that layer.
00:21:55.170 - 00:22:05.990, Speaker C: I actually had a question about interoperability. Is that something that's on all of your minds? I'd love to hear. Where are you thinking cross chain? Is that something that's very important as far as like, your strategy?
00:22:06.730 - 00:22:08.166, Speaker B: I guess I'll go for, I think.
00:22:08.188 - 00:22:08.790, Speaker A: It'S.
00:22:11.930 - 00:22:35.390, Speaker B: Approval that is the most important for us. Yeah, tradfi is important and it's where you hopefully make profit. You make fi product fit for us. It fragments our liquidity. Right now, there's some solutions we're working through. There's some stuff we're trying to do, but no one solved how you're able to effectively say, I want to take out an option on our optimism chain, and then I want to settle it on polygon.
00:22:35.730 - 00:22:36.880, Speaker E: I can tell you how.
00:22:38.690 - 00:22:40.720, Speaker D: Is there any demand for that?
00:22:41.410 - 00:22:51.906, Speaker B: Right now we have three chains and there's trading on all of them. And I think if you said we could have any token, you could be on any chain with any token. There's definitely demand for that.
00:22:52.008 - 00:23:05.506, Speaker A: Really? Because I actually never seen any demand on cross chain lending. For example, why would you ever deposit, let's say, eth on Ethereum and borrow USDC on arbitrage can do that on a chain.
00:23:05.538 - 00:23:10.490, Speaker D: Maybe it's actually a lot of risk, but the majority of people don't.
00:23:11.630 - 00:23:47.458, Speaker B: For us, it's like the we'll stay at safe institution easier, but they want to have access to said any variety of tokens. And if you are bridging and moving all those things over from different chains, not everyone has a native token on like Optimus or broadbitch or whatever, and they want to get access to those. And so they prefer to be on that chain and not have to an omnichain solution, sorry, omnichannel solution, and then not have to deal with having any of the switching over. So I say omnichan is like a holistic solve everything, but it'd be making it easy for them to finalize their trade. It doesn't matter what chain they're on.
00:23:47.464 - 00:23:49.380, Speaker E: At that .2 quick thoughts here.
00:23:51.190 - 00:23:52.806, Speaker C: And guys, we're out of time, so let's keep on.
00:23:52.828 - 00:24:18.846, Speaker E: Okay, I'll be fast. So on the institutional side, I think that the biggest thing to be aware of is that if you play too aggressively to the institutional side, you will not live to see it come to fruition. Right? Like the rate of advancement in that space is going to be significantly slower than everyone thinks because these people naturally move slowly. And so you have to always ensure that you have some level of fit today with the base that's actually on chain. And the second thing is, for those who are looking to learn more about interoperability and liquidity, feel free to chat with me after I know we're out of time.
00:24:18.868 - 00:24:23.150, Speaker C: I was going to say in general, I know we're out of time, but these guys are happy to talk afterwards, always.
00:24:23.220 - 00:24:28.400, Speaker E: And so we're doing a lot of work on that to help solve exactly these issues. Cool.
00:24:29.410 - 00:24:32.346, Speaker C: Anything else? Any last minute words from you, Antonio?
00:24:32.378 - 00:24:33.934, Speaker A: I think Antonio wanted to say something, right?
00:24:33.972 - 00:24:35.720, Speaker F: Well, no, it's okay.
00:24:37.370 - 00:24:45.526, Speaker C: Well, let us know. Thank you everyone again for attending and hopefully stick around. I know we have a lot of other great sessions in this room. Thank you.
00:24:45.628 - 00:24:50.340, Speaker B: Thank you, guys. Close.
