00:00:04.810 - 00:00:21.280, Speaker A: I thought maybe we could start all of this by first doing some quick intros. So I'll just kick it off. I'm heading integrations here at. I've been here for two years working with Defi projects and blockchains such as Solana, maybe. Anatoly, you want to describe yourself?
00:00:23.330 - 00:00:38.140, Speaker B: So, folks, I'm Anatol Lee, co founder CEO of Solana Labs. That's the company that developed the Solana protocol. I'm an operating systems engineer by trade. So really just think of me as an engineer. Awesome to be here.
00:00:39.950 - 00:00:40.698, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:00:40.864 - 00:00:50.010, Speaker A: Anatolia, I thought we could kickstart the discussion with maybe you telling us a bit more about Solana and what really differentiates it in this ecosystem.
00:00:51.950 - 00:01:33.146, Speaker B: Well, some interesting things know come a lot from my background. I spent my career at Qualcomm. If you guys don't know what that company does, if you have a cell phone, there's probably some hardware that was built by Qualcomm in that phone. And I worked on optimizations there for over a decade. So when I had the idea to start Solana, it was really spurred by this eureka moment where I had realized that you can use a verifiable delay function as a source of time outside of consensus. Just like CDMA LTE, TDMA cellular protocols use time to synchronize towers and mobile phones. So that was really kind of what kickstarted it.
00:01:33.146 - 00:02:19.290, Speaker B: And that's a really unique property of Solana than any other network out there. And what makes it unique from a design perspective is it looks and feels like a real time radio protocol, real time operating system. These are the things that play 60 frames per second, high definition video. They're designed to be extremely fast and high throughput at the cost of hardware. So obviously, if you know anything about Salana, you know that we don't shard, but our nodes are expensive, so you can kind of play around with it yourself if you want to, by going to break Solana.com and smash the keyboard and see transactions flying get confirmed.
00:02:21.550 - 00:02:22.106, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:02:22.208 - 00:02:22.714, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:02:22.832 - 00:02:23.066, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:23.088 - 00:02:35.326, Speaker A: So I can say that Chainlink has been integrating over on Solana. So we're currently running on Testnet, and we did see a lot of differences from user and developer experience.
00:02:35.428 - 00:02:35.790, Speaker C: Right.
00:02:35.860 - 00:02:53.486, Speaker A: On our side, what we weren't used to is fast pace of the blockchain. So right now, we're able to put subsequent updates on the chain, which, when you're putting data, changes everything. Obviously, on our side, we are putting data for a while, price data on Ethereum, on different blockchains.
00:02:53.518 - 00:02:53.762, Speaker C: Right.
00:02:53.816 - 00:03:00.390, Speaker A: But the rate of updates we can get onto Solana is faster than anything we've seen before.
00:03:00.460 - 00:03:00.694, Speaker C: Right?
00:03:00.732 - 00:03:43.742, Speaker A: So the data quality we're able to put is much, much more accurate. There is a big difference between putting step second data from extremely high frequency data points for prices, then one data point every 1% deviation, let's say, which is what we're currently kind of forced to do right now. So, yeah, I can say it's been a great experience. Also, the things that developers will probably notice is rust. Basically, it's rust programming language for smart contracts, which obviously does make a difference, and I think it does offer very interesting tools for developers. What would you say about the Rust experience on Solana?
00:03:43.886 - 00:04:50.330, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of that also comes from know I spent my career in C C, and when I had a chance to build a new operating system, a new framework, Rust was a natural choice because it is such a great systems language with really strong compiler support for safety and correctness. It's been voted by GitHub engineers like by GitHub developers as the number one loved language. I think it's in the top ten of the most used languages in GitHub. It's really hard to start a new programming language that makes it that far. Think of it as hard as building a blockchain, as hard as building crypto in general, because it requires adoption across a wide variety of use cases by a wide variety of skill sets and engineers. So I'm also just as impressed of Rust's success as the cryptos in general. So in itself, it's pretty remarkable achievement.
00:04:50.330 - 00:05:21.730, Speaker B: We're happy with it, really, from this idea that you can write in a modern language that doesn't have garbage collection, that doesn't have dynamic execution, you can actually use the kind of performance that you expect as a C developer, but with the same safety and next generation language features that you get out of something like go or more sophisticated languages, even like Ocaml or Haskell.
00:05:22.790 - 00:05:44.246, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say what's interesting about rust, what I've seen from the outside, that it's basically setting a standard, right. You're not siloed in your own ecosystem when you cut in rust. People are using rust for WASM codes, they're using rust in many different applications. And the fact that you're able to leverage this ecosystem is probably going to make it much easier to get people building on top of Solana.
00:05:44.278 - 00:05:44.426, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:44.448 - 00:05:56.346, Speaker A: So people who are in the traditional world, very intelligent people, building infrastructure, building different types of applications, will have a much easier time getting onboarded there. Would you say that's accurate?
00:05:56.538 - 00:05:57.038, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:57.124 - 00:07:01.140, Speaker B: The key thing with any kind of platform is that can an engineer self serve, right? Can they actually, when they're faced with a problem, can they google and figure it out and move forward? And for that to be possible, you need, effectively, network effects. You just need enough stuff out there. Examples, libraries and JavaScript is like beautiful at that. Right? NPM has everything in the world implemented at this point. Rust is getting pretty close in terms of systems, languages. And we love the package management system for smart contracts because we see now that users that are building smart contracts on Solana are able to use that same kind of like NPM style. Let's write a package that's commonly used across a bunch of developers, use it across a bunch of smart contracts, and now that allows the whole ecosystem to leverage and allows the next developer to self serve and figure it out, because they can Google for it and figure out what dependencies they need and move forward.
00:07:01.140 - 00:07:06.760, Speaker B: So those kinds of network effects are really powerful when they work, right?
00:07:07.690 - 00:07:38.554, Speaker A: Yeah, fully agree. I think it's all about network effects, not only at the adoption side, right. But also there are many different types of network effects. You have, for instance, validators on your networks, you have node operators. The fact that so many people start running nodes and start sharing resources and best practices, I mean, you basically see a whole ecosystem grow and you don't need to control or to help the growth anymore. You don't need to send resources, people start learning, they start sharing, and growth just accelerates.
00:07:38.602 - 00:07:38.766, Speaker C: Right?
00:07:38.788 - 00:08:04.182, Speaker A: That's what we've seen with our users, with our node operators, and even our data providers. And I think you see the same with validators. I was looking at the tools being built on Solana by validators, explorers, wallet, all of this stuff. I mean, that's why network effects and standards are so important, in my view. So, anatoly, regarding the chaining integration, we're probably going to go. Well, we're aiming to go to Mainnet on Q four.
00:08:04.236 - 00:08:04.406, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:04.428 - 00:08:29.882, Speaker A: On Solana. We've got an insane demand from hundreds of applications. Lots of people are building on top of Solana. Synthetic platforms, futures platforms, dexers lending. Basically any defi use case you could think of is building on top. And everyone is featuring some really interesting stuff. They want super high frequency, they want super low fees, nonexistent fees.
00:08:29.882 - 00:08:39.140, Speaker A: Most of the time they want to go to forex equities, all of this stuff. Tell us a bit more about what excites you about this ecosystem that's being built.
00:08:40.790 - 00:09:29.300, Speaker B: I'm really excited about the number of developers that are basically, they quit their cushy jobs at Google and decided to go eat glass and be a CEO of a startup and really grind out product, market fit and build something new and unique. And in my mind, that is really like the most important thing. Can we get the next generation of builders to come and join crypto and start building products for millions of users? Because this is where you're actually going to get adoption. You need somebody that's constantly building products that do create some value for the end user. It's not the platforms, right? It's not oracles don't do it, layer ones don't do it. It's actually the folks building those products. So to me, that's really the most exciting thing about this.
00:09:29.300 - 00:10:06.014, Speaker B: I think finance and Defi is almost like the obvious kind of use case when people discovered cement. They started building bricks out of cement because this is how they knew to build houses. They knew how to build houses out of brick, so that's what they did. And we see finance as a very obvious brick that we can build on these systems. What I'm really excited about is when we get all these amazing founders, each one of them get a few million users. All of a sudden there's 100, 200 million users on the same network. And this is where the skyscrapers are going to be built, right.
00:10:06.014 - 00:11:04.442, Speaker B: This is where the stuff that we can't even imagine right now is going to be accomplished. So that's the future I'm really looking forward to. And it's right around the corner. Three years, right. We're going to see this kind of exponential growth in the next three years, because the difference now at a time in crypto, like 2017, is that founders are able to join crypto and build a product and get to market in weeks and raise funding. In our hackathons, we saw folks know nothing about crypto really, besides being interested in it or trading it, knowing some C, join Solana, build their application, and raise funding in the span of four weeks, and then start getting users basically right through the hackathon. So this kind of iteration of actual user adoption is really critical for that growth.
00:11:04.442 - 00:11:18.280, Speaker B: And the only time I remember this is being like a teenager and seeing that happen on the Internet in the 90s. So this is quite kind of once in a generation type of event. I'm just super excited to be a part of it.
00:11:19.050 - 00:11:39.466, Speaker A: Yeah, I fully agree. I think what's happening is that we're building platforms in the end. Solana is a platform chaining is a platform. We're giving tools to people to build the next generation stuff, the next exchanges, the next leverage platform. All of this stuff. There is too much stuff to know to learn for one person or one group to do it.
00:11:39.488 - 00:11:40.186, Speaker C: All. Right.
00:11:40.288 - 00:11:54.282, Speaker A: What should happen and what you're working on together is providing tools. So we're providing Oracle, you're providing smart contract execution platform. We're providing these tools so that these pioneers in a way can go and set the frontiers of innovation further and further.
00:11:54.346 - 00:11:54.960, Speaker C: Right?
00:11:55.410 - 00:12:03.326, Speaker A: It's like in the gold rush. We're basically selling the shovels and the stuff for people to go and dig and find the next gold mine.
00:12:03.358 - 00:12:03.506, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:03.528 - 00:12:06.562, Speaker A: And the gold mine here is a use case which can change the world.
00:12:06.616 - 00:12:06.882, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:06.936 - 00:12:26.454, Speaker A: Like stuff that people can start using, whether it's defi, whether it's gaming, maybe. And yeah, I do share your excitement. I think it's going to be very exciting stuff coming up. And the fact that the fees are solo on Solana will allow to start getting people who were before kind of closed out of this ecosystem.
00:12:26.502 - 00:12:26.762, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:26.816 - 00:12:34.560, Speaker A: Completely siloed. I think dropping these fees and being able to offer security and affordability is a huge, huge deal here.
00:12:35.890 - 00:12:57.000, Speaker B: Agreed? Yeah. We need these networks to be able to handle a billion users for the developers, the founders coming into the space to imagine that being possible. Right. They need to feel like they can do it and kind of not worry about scaling or costs and really take a big shot at a big use case.
00:12:58.170 - 00:12:58.918, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:12:59.084 - 00:13:07.400, Speaker A: So beyond Defi and Atoli, is there anything else that you think Solana could really differentiate itself in the.
00:13:09.370 - 00:14:03.274, Speaker B: Know? What I think is that the future finance will be a critical component of these next generation use cases, but probably not in the way that you expect. A Google Ad is 0.2 cents of value being transferred. If our fees are 100 times cheaper than that, developers can start imagining social networks where tokens and the exchanges of those tokens is maybe a 0.2 cent microtransaction, but because the underlying fees are much, much cheaper than that, that's actually valuable business model that may scale when you have 10 million users, right, in the same group. So those kinds of use cases are just, folks haven't tried it because the market is so small. We don't have 10 million monthly active users in crypto yet, let alone like 10 million out of a larger chunk for you to build your small social network or something like that.
00:14:03.274 - 00:14:41.800, Speaker B: So what I'm really excited about is people that are getting into the space and trying ideas that may not work today. But will work when we get to that largest market share of adoption in the world. So those are the things that are the big shots on goal that really have outlying chances of success and really that Facebook level of adoption where, I don't know if you guys remember in 2003, they were gaining a million users a month and that was kind of like jaw dropping. Right? Nobody really expected that to be a trillion dollar company.
00:14:42.970 - 00:15:07.230, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the beautiful thing here is that we have all of these barriers which existed. Like, for instance, oracles can put data every subsecond, right? And users can't pay cents on the dollar to get a transaction. When you lift all of these barriers, stuff will start appearing and use cases will start coming up without even us being able to see what they will be before.
00:15:07.300 - 00:15:07.726, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:07.828 - 00:15:19.682, Speaker A: We'll be able to see all of this ecosystem grow once we see these barriers lifted and kind of innovation just grow super quick. So, yeah, we're really looking forward to be on Solana and Q four and start doing all of this together.
00:15:19.736 - 00:15:49.100, Speaker B: I have to say, same like, oracles play such a critical role in this because the blockchain itself can never really know all the data outside of the world. Right. This function of actually being the eyes for the smart contracts is like a critical piece that is quite necessary. So I'm super excited working with you guys in this high fidelity. I think best version of Chainlink is going to be on Solana, so I'm really excited for that to happen.
00:15:49.790 - 00:15:51.866, Speaker C: Perfect. Awesome.
00:15:52.048 - 00:15:55.774, Speaker A: All right, Angie, I see that we're running at the close.
00:15:55.972 - 00:16:09.840, Speaker D: All right, thank you both for joining us and talking us through this. Just to hear the opportunity of the scale of the opportunity, rather, is always amazing and appreciate hearing from you, Anatoli. And thank you, Johan, for joining us as well.
