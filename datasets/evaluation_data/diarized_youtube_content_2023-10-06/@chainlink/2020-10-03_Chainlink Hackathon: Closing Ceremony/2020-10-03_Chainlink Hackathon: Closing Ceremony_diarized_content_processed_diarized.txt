00:00:00.650 - 00:00:21.242, Speaker A: The link. I believe we're just about set up here. Go live. I can actually. There we go. Yes. So I just sent the live stream link in, chat in the answers there.
00:00:21.242 - 00:00:38.594, Speaker A: It is also on the discord, and it should be in your calendar invite. It is now six. So we are now live. Keenan? Yeah. Like I said, a couple of the panelists are going to be jumping in as panelists. If you want to facilitate jumping in and out, that would be fantastic. Great.
00:00:38.594 - 00:01:03.238, Speaker A: Well, welcome, everybody, to the closing ceremony of the chain link hackathon. It has been an insane couple of weeks. Starting September 7. Let's actually starting September 7, going to September 27. And then there was a week of judging. An insane week. There were so many projects, so many fantastic projects.
00:01:03.238 - 00:01:33.442, Speaker A: And just. We're really thrilled by the response the community gave. We're absolutely thrilled by all the projects that we got and all the people that signed up. Just to give you all a little bit of an idea of kind of the scale of this hackathon. It was an absolutely insane hackathon. And just like a big thank you to everybody. So some of the stats on this hackathon are we had over 70 valid submissions.
00:01:33.442 - 00:02:17.118, Speaker A: Right? And last year we had, I think it was 35, maybe 40. So we basically doubled it from last year. 70 plus submissions in the cryptocurrency space accounts for a massive hackathon. So we all need to be really proud of the projects that we did here. Everybody should be really proud of themselves because that's a massive number. We had $50,000 to $60,000 in prizes. So a huge thank you to the sponsors for coming in and for being a part of this and for helping facilitate kind of this community of amazing projects and building this community that says, hey, there are all these open source projects out there, all these open source technologies.
00:02:17.118 - 00:02:41.194, Speaker A: They're all very collaborative. We can build on multiple platforms at the same time. So a massive thank you to the sponsors there. We had 1400 sign ups. That is 1400 engineers sign up. So Dev post just has the people who submitted, and that doesn't have to be the whole team, but we had 1400 engineers sign up. That is an insane amount of sign up.
00:02:41.194 - 00:03:29.066, Speaker A: So just a huge thank you to everybody who helped get the word out and have other engineers being excited or even non engineers, because a lot of the projects they had, non engineers. Hackathons aren't exclusively for engineers. They're for anybody who wants to come in here and build and help bring about, again, this fourth industrial revolution. Because as we were saying before, these really are the stomping grounds for creativity, the stomping grounds for innovation. And it's these hackathons that scales blockchain and scales technology to the next surface, to the next level. Again, I just wanted to point out, gelato, the last time they participated at a hackathon, they were a participant and now they are a sponsor. And we've seen a lot of projects do exactly that.
00:03:29.066 - 00:04:07.222, Speaker A: So it's really exciting to see that. And also, the diversity was crazy at this hackathon. There were 45 plus countries who signed up. So definitely a global event. It does make it a little bit easier that it was a virtual event for it to be global, but just super exciting to see the different groups of people coming in building and getting really excited to build smart contracts, build universally connected smart contracts with Chainlink. So just a huge round of applause to everybody who attended, who participated, who helped. Just a huge round of applause to everybody here.
00:04:07.222 - 00:04:44.382, Speaker A: Thank you so much for participating and building, and you all should be very proud of yourselves. And just a huge round of applause there. With that said, let's go over what we're going to be talking about this closing ceremony. So that's the first bit, obviously. Thank you all so much for being here. Thank you all so much for submitting. I know myself personally, I've had the honor of meeting and interacting with a lot of you, whether it was support in discord or, well, that's where the majority of it was support, in discord or some emails or even on some calls for help, talking about different projects, brainstorming.
00:04:44.382 - 00:05:18.634, Speaker A: It's been an honor to meet so many of you, and I know I speak for a lot of the different people working on the Chainlink project too, that you've interacted with. It's been the same there. The response has been, hey, the participants of the chain Link hackathon really have been super inclusive. They've been super active, really creative, really intelligent, and it's been fantastic to work with everybody. So just a big thank you there again. But yeah, anyways, so getting into what we're going to be going over at this closing ceremony. So just to give you the breakdown.
00:05:18.634 - 00:06:31.750, Speaker A: So first we're actually going to have all of our sponsor prizes go over the winners of their projects, and then after that we will go over the chain link prizes and the three big categories. Again, they are $4,000 in link for the best d five project, $4,000 in link for the best open project, $4,000 in link for the best gaming or NFT project and the grand prize of $8,000 in link for the best overall project. Some of those grand prizes are huge. Sorry about that. Some of those grand prizes are absolutely massive and we're really excited to be giving them out here. We also had ten runner ups originally on those chain link prizes, and we actually had to bump that up to twelve just because there were so many fantastic prizes. We were having such a hard time kind of figuring out, deciding who to give these runner up prizes to and we wanted to just make sure that we gave as many prizes as we can because there are so many fantastic projects.
00:06:31.750 - 00:07:10.430, Speaker A: Sorry about that. There's something stuck in my throat here. But yeah, like I said, there were just so many fantastic prizes. One other thing as well. At the end of this ceremony, we'll go over one additional piece because we had such fantastic submissions. Because there were so many people who gave these awesome submissions, we want to do something a little bit extra special. So we are actually launching a program as well to help some of those engineers who built something, but maybe didn't quite get the runner up.
00:07:10.430 - 00:08:00.848, Speaker A: We're going to be reaching out. We'll talk more a little bit about that, so be sure to stay tuned for that. We've recently sent out the swag type forms, so those of you who sent valid submissions in, you will be getting a type form to get swag back, basically just asking for your size, for a t shirt and all the different pieces of swag. So be on the lookout for that sometime next week. And this is really exciting. We'll be sending a feedback form to basically get your feedback on what you liked, what you didn't like, any other bits of information there. And along with the feedback form again, because the response was so fantastic and we've literally never done this before, this is the first time we've ever done something like this.
00:08:00.848 - 00:08:43.848, Speaker A: We're actually going to be sending every project that sent a valid submission in. We're going to be sending them seven link to basically help facilitate when they go to Mainnet. So everyone who sent a valid submission, congratulations, you're going to be getting seven link. Just be sure to look out for that along with the feedback form again. And the reason that we're doing this and we've never done this before is just to show how hard it was for us to pick just 18 projects or however many projects we had to pick because there were so many fantastic submissions we really want to give back. So that's going to be what we're going to be doing. So a huge round of applause to everybody again for sending in these fantastic submissions.
00:08:43.848 - 00:09:11.572, Speaker A: Because you sent in so many wonderful submissions, we literally had to give at least something back. So thank you again. Be sure to look out for the feedback form next week. You fill that out, put a clean ETH wallet address in there, and we'll be sending each valid submission seven link. So huge round of applause for you guys there as well. Thank you so much for sending in so many amazing submissions. So we're going to stay up to date with you guys.
00:09:11.572 - 00:09:34.116, Speaker A: Be sure to stay up to date with us in the discord and on Twitter and everything, because we want to keep supporting and keep helping everybody out. So that is the first bit of announcements. And with that, we will dive right into the sponsor prizes, starting with Elena from the crypto Chicks Foundation. Elena, let's.
00:09:34.228 - 00:09:34.888, Speaker B: Hello.
00:09:35.054 - 00:09:37.224, Speaker A: Hello. Thank you so much for being here.
00:09:37.342 - 00:09:42.976, Speaker B: Yeah, unfortunately, I cannot start my video. Right, because it's disabled for some reason. So is it?
00:09:43.158 - 00:09:47.810, Speaker A: Oh, let's fix that. I think you should be able to do it now.
00:09:48.180 - 00:09:59.172, Speaker B: All right. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you, everybody. Fantastic hackathon. I was judging many great submissions here.
00:09:59.172 - 00:10:42.864, Speaker B: I represent the cryptocix organization and we have a cryptocix hatchery, which is the business line that helping hackathons to turn their hacks into the business. So with that, we have a $2,000 Avi integration award. It's for those who, the participants of our hatchery who is integrating Avi into their projects. And for the hackathon, winner of the Chainlink hackathon. I would like to congratulate farm together project for winning this category. So Farm together. You can join our hatchery.
00:10:42.864 - 00:11:33.396, Speaker B: You can take free of charge. You can take advantage of this $2,000 award at the end of the hatchery. You also can take advantage of our 20 mentors that we have in blockchain technology that they already built their businesses and the ones that they will be coaching you. And also we have over 20 workshops and courses that we're going throughout the year which teach you on how to build your business. So this is given to you as the price of this Hackathon. So please contact me at Stayintouch at Cryptotix CA to claim the prize. And also, we actually awarded this prize to the runner up, which is chain link Prediction market.
00:11:33.396 - 00:12:14.690, Speaker B: So, guys, congratulations to the runner up getting the same benefits. So please also contact me at Stayintouch at Cryptocix CA. And I also would like to everybody who implemented in this Hackathon, if you have Avi in your project. Please also go to cryptocixhatchery.com and apply at the Cryptocix hatchery because we would like you also to qualify you and to help you out and also enter used for this $2,000 price. And again, congratulations to you guys and Happy Hacking in the future. Thank you.
00:12:19.140 - 00:12:40.472, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much. Yeah, so just to reiterate that anybody else who's bidding a valid project wants to apply for the crypto Chicks Hatchery. Definitely check it out. It's a great program for anybody looking to scale from project to business. And again, these are the stomping grounds that allow that to happen. And crypto Chicks is an Example of a program that can really take you to the next Level.
00:12:40.472 - 00:12:55.930, Speaker A: So definitely check that out. Congratulations to Farm together in prediction market. So next up we have Lewis from Gelato and it's a little bit late where he is in Germany right now, so he actually sent in a Video. So let me share that now.
00:13:08.740 - 00:14:12.950, Speaker C: Hello everyone. I recorded this Video for you because I'm here in Germany and I'm having an early Nap time today, so I'm not quite on time for the Hackathon. But I'm very excited to announce the winners for the Gelato prize and the first place. Or let's actually start with the third place. We have three prizes. The third place goes to the Gelato smart vault, which is a really cool project that used gelato and instadep debt bridge use case to automatically refinance a borrowing position from maker to compound if the borrowing rate is better on compound and it uses gelato for that to basically monitor interest or borrowing rates in this case, and then automatically refinance the loan. And the second place goes to take and stop.
00:14:12.950 - 00:15:17.264, Speaker C: This is actually a one man hackathon project and that person deployed to Mainnet and also built a UI on main net, which is I think quite cool. You should definitely check it out. It's a automatic stop loss for ETH to die. It actually uses the chain ETH USD price feed in order to determine when the ETH price drops and when it drops as a user, you can visit the UI configure like a lower bound for the price drop, and then as soon as that limit is reached, it will automatically sell you even to die basically. And the first place goes to on time. This is actually a very impressive mainet application that also has a UI on Mainet, and this is kind of similar to the previous one with the stop loss. But in this case you can also define multiple time intervals.
00:15:17.264 - 00:16:08.200, Speaker C: So what you can do is you can basically have automatic dollar cost averaging on uniswap. So you could, like, say, for example, buy ETH every two days perpetually, you only have to visit the front end once, deploy a proxy, and then you can configure it once only, and it will run perpetually or for as long as you have basically ETH to sell. So this is our winner on time. Congratulations also to the gelato smart world and to take a stop. We were quite happy with the submissions also, thank you very much to all the other submissions. I think what we really valued in the end is also people deploying to Mainnet, even on a hackathon, and just testing and proud of it. So this has been great.
00:16:08.200 - 00:16:25.040, Speaker C: And anyone that is interested in building on glasso, just reach out to us anytime and we'd be happy to help you to do so. Thank you very much also to the chaining team for supporting us. And yeah, we're looking forward to the next tech performance. Thanks from the gelato team and goodbye.
00:16:30.660 - 00:16:40.452, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much. Lewis from the gelato team. So again, that was on time taken. Stop. And the gelato smart vault. So congratulations to all of you guys there.
00:16:40.452 - 00:17:00.732, Speaker A: Very well done. And again, for the projects that win, feel free to ping me. Feel free to ping somebody else from the team. And we can help you guys get connected. Next week, we'll get you connected with the sponsors so we can go ahead with those there. Next, we have Tegan from the graph. I think she is here.
00:17:00.732 - 00:17:13.212, Speaker A: Awesome. There she is. Let me make you a co host so you can actually share your screen. Thank you so much for being here.
00:17:13.346 - 00:17:42.708, Speaker D: Of course. Thank you so much. Hi, everyone. My name is Tegan Klein, and I focus on all things business for the graph. And the graph is really organizing the world's blockchain data. And it was an honor to be selected as a judge for this wonderful chainlink hackathon. We at the graph, we wanted to support our good friends at Chainlink and the community, so we offered up two bounties of $1,500 each for the best sub graphs that were built using chain link data for this hackathon.
00:17:42.708 - 00:18:37.828, Speaker D: And I absolutely echo what Patrick said at the beginning, choosing was very difficult. So it's nice to see that chain link gave that generous link allocation to the teams that did participate. So the graph subgraph winners are. The first bounty goes to Sci fiance, which is an R D undertaking to build financially engineered liquidity, mining driven economic models and other engineered financial products driven by AI on distributed ledger technology. The second bounty goes to Ren NFT, which is a protocol layer that is enabling peer to peer renting of NFT tokens while also generating interest yield. This opens up the doors to NFT holders and users to both benefit. I think both of these are very timely, just given all of the innovation we're seeing in the defi space and then this emerging trend that we're seeing in the NFT space.
00:18:37.828 - 00:18:49.630, Speaker D: So congratulations to our two winners. Thank you so much for using the graph to make blockchain data more easily accessible to the developers and the users alike. Thank you.
00:18:53.940 - 00:19:16.552, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, Tegan, for being here. And thank you to everyone who built on the graph. As you know, there were some fantastic projects there. So Renft sci finance, well done. Congratulations. So moving on, we're actually going to go on to the ample prizes here, and so the ample fourth team couldn't be here, so I'm actually going to be presenting for them.
00:19:16.552 - 00:19:46.268, Speaker A: So ample. Again, there was some fantastic submissions for their project and the winner of their bounty was ample harvest. So congratulations to ample harvest. Be sure to check out ample harvest at the submissions gallery. They have a very wonderful pumpkin logo which is appropriate for the time. So congratulations to ample harvest on winning the ample fourth bounty. Next is the ave prizes.
00:19:46.268 - 00:20:11.770, Speaker A: And Ave it's very late for them as well, so they sent in a video as well. So let me share that with you. Here's and again, Ave had two prizes of $2,500. Let me share that here.
00:20:14.700 - 00:20:59.064, Speaker D: Hey guys, thanks for participating in the chain link hackathon. I hope you guys had a lot of fun and we had some fun looking at all the entries that built on are they? So it was really cool to see. So as a reminder, we had two prizes, two prizes of 2500 a USDC since our a tokens. They've been accruing interest since then, so it might be a little bit more than that. And we're really looking for the best integration of are they and chain link. So happy to announce we've picked our two winners and one of the winners is farm together. So farm together is creating a no loss RPG game.
00:20:59.064 - 00:21:29.680, Speaker D: We're really impressed with this. It looks fantastic. Really excited to see it go to mainnet and further progress. The second prize goes to real hedge, so they're creating or allowing you to hedge against your property value, either going down and price movements in your property. So also looking forward to seeing that progress and become a bigger project or company. Even. So, congrats on our two winners.
00:21:31.460 - 00:21:31.968, Speaker C: For.
00:21:32.054 - 00:22:05.308, Speaker D: Everyone else that didn't win, feel free to apply for grants. Also, the winners can also apply for grants. To find the link, just go to this link here, docsarve.com portal and click on dev grants in the menu. And we'd love to see some of these projects progress and mature and become successful companies, projects and protocols. Yeah, hope you guys had fun in the hackathon and we'll probably see you around on discord or Twitter. Thanks.
00:22:05.308 - 00:22:06.140, Speaker D: Bye.
00:22:10.480 - 00:22:29.380, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks so much David. And just to echo what David said, you know, there were so many fantastic submissions here. Whether you won or you didn't know, be sure to apply for some of these grants. If you want to take your project to the next level or feel free to join another hackathon. ETH online is actually coming up right now. It kicked off today.
00:22:29.380 - 00:22:59.596, Speaker A: Chainlink is sponsoring that, and a number of other sponsors are there as well. So be sure to check that out if you want to build a new project or if you want to add to your own project as well. Definitely check out ETH online. Definitely check out some of the grants and stay connected. Definitely stay in the discord so you can stay connected with everybody here. So just to echo what David said there, the next prizes actually is the Tezos prizes. So Tezos had a number of prizes, and let me go over those right now.
00:22:59.596 - 00:23:49.816, Speaker A: So the Tezos team is a little bit late for them too. So they asked me to award for them. So Tezos ended up giving out four prizes to four different teams. The first two, for their decentralized finance track or defi payments and onsite settlements, goes to Tez auction. Tez auction actually had entered a hackathon before, and they added Chainlink Oracles onto their project for this hackathon. So this is just, again, if you've built something before, you want to add something new to it, you want to add something interesting, you can absolutely bring those to the new hackathons. Just ping whoever is running the hackathon and say, hey, I would like to submit a project I did at a different hackathon, but I'm going to do X differently.
00:23:49.816 - 00:24:13.590, Speaker A: I'm going to add this feature to it. And that's the key piece there. It's being judged on the feature, and they did a great job there. Second place, and they got $2,000 in USD for that. Second place for $1,000 is the Bifrost baking token. So those are the two winners of the Tezos DFI track. So congratulations to the two of those.
00:24:13.590 - 00:24:47.132, Speaker A: They also had a data feeds track for doing really interesting things with data feeds. And first place for the data feeds track is actually random mirror. So that is random mirror, and. Sorry, I'm getting the notes on it here. So random mirror. So this is another prize that got $2,000. And this is a really cool open source resource, putting together contributions from different parts of the whole crypto ecosystem.
00:24:47.132 - 00:25:23.260, Speaker A: It presents a smart contract with, interacts with the Chainlink VRF, and broadcasts it to other chains like the Tezos chain. So really cool projects there. And then second place for the data feeds track went to the Tezos sign project. So that was the Tezos sign project. So that was $1,000 in prizes for the Tezos sign. And just a huge round of applause for all the projects that worked with Tezos and chain link. Doing some of this cross chain communication stuff is really tough, is really tricky.
00:25:23.260 - 00:25:57.156, Speaker A: So congratulations to all the teams who built with Tezos here, too. So that was $1,000 for Tezos sign. So congratulations to those four teams. Tez auction, bifrost, baking token, random mirror, and tezos sign. Moving on, we have ens with Brantley. I believe Brantley is here. Is Brantley.
00:25:57.156 - 00:26:31.312, Speaker A: Here's one of the panelists here, Brantley. I don't see him in the chat here. Maybe he wasn't able to attend. Oh, apologies. Sorry about that, guys. Yeah, he sent me last minute that he wasn't going to be able to attend either. Sorry about that, guys.
00:26:31.312 - 00:27:07.352, Speaker A: My mistake. Yeah. So, Brantley, for ENs, there were three fantastic prizes that they ended up giving out for different submissions that used Ens. The first one goes to, and each one of these prizes is for $750 for implementing ENs into the project. The first one is for the parametric water level insurance. So this was a really cool project that took, actually, water level data to provide insurance. And so they actually built an external adapter for this, which was really exciting.
00:27:07.352 - 00:27:31.204, Speaker A: They also implemented ENs, obviously. So congratulations to parametric water level insurance. The next one was for lotto Dow, so they actually built a decentralized lottery using chainlink VRF to get random numbers. Really cool stuff. Be sure to check them out, too. They also implemented Ens, so that's another 752 lotto dow. Congratulations to them.
00:27:31.204 - 00:27:57.976, Speaker A: And the last one was Dex grows. So congratulations to Dex grows. They built a decentralized escrow service for bitcoin and ethereum. So really exciting stuff. These are some really powerful projects, and they each won $750 from Ens. So congratulations to parametric water level insurance, Lottodao and Dex scros. Next is the Polkadot winners, Polka dot winners.
00:27:57.976 - 00:28:06.770, Speaker A: And actually, Dan sent us a video, and it's a little late for the polka dot team too. So let me share the video with you here.
00:28:13.240 - 00:28:57.280, Speaker C: Everybody. This is Dan Racer dialing in through video from the web Three foundation. So I work on the community and growth team at web3. We're one of the primary organizations behind the Polka Dot and Kusama networks. First, thanks for our friends at Chainlink for organizing this awesome hackathon. We're really close to a lot of the people on the Chainlink team and always like interacting with you guys, so we appreciate you involving us. For those of you not super aware of what Polkadot is, Polkadot at the highest level is basically a layer zero multi chain network that's basically offering interoperability and scalability to a variety of blockchains.
00:28:57.280 - 00:29:52.550, Speaker C: These blockchains that can be kind of connected to Polkadot's network can either be custom built blockchains with our framework called Substrate. We're also integrating with bridging technology to existing networks like bitcoin and Ethereum. So for this hackathon, Polka Dot was offering some challenges of five K for first place, three k for second place, and teams were encouraged to, of course, use substrate to build the projects which relates to polka Dot. But then also we're encouraged to integrate chain links technology for 25% additional portion of the prize. So let's get straight to it. So, first place, congratulations to developer named Laurent. Key Dot is a project that he built based on a platform on the traditional web called Kiva, which is a kind of micro lending platform.
00:29:52.550 - 00:30:36.720, Speaker C: His goal was to basically integrate kiva with blockchain using substrate, and that's what kind of led to the creation of keydot. Laurent was able to leverage the Chainlink palettes and adapter and initiator in his solution, in addition to a lot of these custom palettes that he created for substrate. And he even found some improvements to make to the substrate and chain link bridge to get things working with the latest version of substrate, which is 2.0. So congrats, awesome job to Lauren, and really cool to see you integrating this with the project. That's kind of helping the world as well. Second place was subswap. So subswap was built by some developers named Jacob Josh and Young sook.
00:30:36.720 - 00:31:10.990, Speaker C: Their project was another amazing project. Both teams just did a great job. This subswap solution was a permissionless value exchange protocol based on substrate. It's basically an automated market making decks to use for native substrate tokens, which are the tokens built with the substrate framework. So that's about it. Thanks again for inviting us to the hackathon. Congratulations to Kida and subswap for winning first and second place, and we hope to see everybody soon.
00:31:10.990 - 00:31:12.430, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:31:18.080 - 00:31:34.310, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks so much, Dan. So again, that was keydot and subdex. Congratulations. Really cool stuff, really powerful stuff. Both of them ended up doing some substrate integrations, and again, key integrated substrate with Chainlink to make a really powerful platform. So congratulations there.
00:31:34.310 - 00:31:51.130, Speaker A: Next we have Gregory, who also couldn't be here. He sent in a video, though, for the DAP University prize. So this was a really popular prize. Really excited to see the turnout here, and I will let Gregory do the talking.
00:31:51.820 - 00:32:58.492, Speaker E: All right, everybody, so unfortunately, I couldn't be here with you today at the closing ceremony for the Chainlink hackathon, but I wanted to record this quick video as the next best thing to discuss my top picks for the DAP University prize. All right, so there are two winners, but before I announce those, I want to say that this is a hard decision because there were a lot of really good projects submitted for this prize. There's a lot of hard work, a lot of talent, a lot of ambitious developers out there who know building cool stuff. So this is a difficult decision, but I do want to announce my two picks for the DAP University prize and what I liked about those projects. So the first one is golden star swap. All right, so what I really liked about this project is it uses Chainlink for the DeFi use case, and it has a very ambitious vision of doing cross chain lending, which I think could be a really solid use case in DeFi, especially as other chains start to adopt it and we see that kind of need pick up. So I like that.
00:32:58.492 - 00:33:18.372, Speaker E: But I also really like how it didn't bite off more than it could chew. Right. It started off with the basic component that you need in order to accomplish cross chain lending, which is just a cross chain swap. So basically just moving cryptocurrency from one chain to another, one blockchain to another, because that's what you need to get started.
00:33:18.426 - 00:33:19.076, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:19.258 - 00:33:59.164, Speaker E: And so I really like that they sort of presented this minimum viable product at the hackathon. It looks really nice, but they also have this goal of building it off, building on top of it to create a much more sophisticated project. And even then, just the MVP is also a sophisticated effort for a hackathon. And that's one of the main reasons that I chose this project. So the next project is Monkey Paul and this is a platform for incentivizing open source contribution. So I really like this project for lots of reasons. I think that basically automated income earning is going to start to become a pretty big deal on blockchain.
00:33:59.164 - 00:34:38.120, Speaker E: We're basically having some sort of bounty, some sort of thing where you can basically just say here, I need this done and I don't have to stand in the way somebody else just do this and they earn money automatically. I think that's going to be big in the future. And this was a cool project that does that does it with GitHub, pull requests. And I think that a lot of the early adopters in the blockchain space are developers. I think it's a natural sort of product market fit for developers. And I think this is a product that can really be built on to turn into a real life vision. This is a great first effort.
00:34:38.120 - 00:35:07.284, Speaker E: And on top of that, I also liked the use of chainlink oracles in this way. It seems like sort of an out of the box way of using Chainlink oracles that I haven't seen a lot of other people focusing on. So of course you can use Chainlink for a lot of different things, but this seems to be a way that I haven't seen a lot of other people doing. So I like the creativity with that. Those are my top two picks for the Chainlink hackathon DAP University prize. So again, this was a hard decision. There are a lot of really great projects out of there.
00:35:07.284 - 00:35:22.780, Speaker E: So congratulations to everybody who participated. A lot of great hard work. Right? Again, I'm sorry I couldn't be with you today, but hope you'll take this video as the next best thing. And until next time, I hope that I'll see you on DAP University. All right, bye bye.
00:35:26.720 - 00:35:48.150, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, Gregory. And again to those projects that won. You actually won a free membership to DAP University. So I know a lot of you were looking to get more solidity and blockchain development experience. So just really exciting to have DAP University here to help a lot of the newer projects and the newer engineers. So congratulations there as well.
00:35:48.150 - 00:36:29.356, Speaker A: Okay, so with that, that actually comes to our conclusion for the sponsorship prizes. So congratulations to all the engineers and all the projects and all the non engineers too, who built all these fantastic platforms for these sponsorship prizes. There were a lot of amazing sponsorship prizes. Be sure to connect with us, connect with the sponsors to learn more about how you can go about receiving your prize and everyone who's here. Who didn't do one of these prizes or didn't do one of these projects? Definitely check out Dev post. Definitely check out these projects. They put a lot of really hard work into these projects and they're really powerful.
00:36:29.356 - 00:36:48.592, Speaker A: They're really powerful. Really creativity, really creative. Definitely be sure to go check it out. Give it a, like, give them a comment. If you see a product that you find particularly interesting, be sure to give them a share online just to show those products a little bit of extra love. I'm sure the engineers would really appreciate that. So congratulations again.
00:36:48.592 - 00:37:26.070, Speaker A: Another huge round of applause for our sponsors for making this possible, for bringing these extra prizes in. This really made this a community event, a smart contract community event, a blockchain community event. So we're just really excited to have so many fantastic sponsors be a part of this hackathon. So just another huge thank you to all of our so. And with that, we will move on to the chain link prizes. So these are the chain link prizes for the chain link hackathon. Here there were four different sets of prizes that you could win.
00:37:26.070 - 00:38:18.420, Speaker A: There were ten runner up spots of $500 and again, we actually had to bump that number up because of how many fantastic prizes there were. And then there were the three tracks, our open DFI and NfTgaming, each for $4,000. And then we had our grand prize of $8,000 in link for the best overall project. And with that said, again, those projects that didn't quite make the runner up, again because we thought they were so fantastic, we basically said, thank you so much for participating. We would love to help you on your next step in your journey. So again, we're giving seven link out to all the projects that didn't get a prize because there were just so many fantastic projects and so many fantastic submissions. So thank you so much again to everybody who submitted.
00:38:18.420 - 00:38:56.780, Speaker A: And without further ado, here were the runner ups for the chain link prizes. So there are twelve here. Each one will get $500 in link. And so in no particular order, so the runner ups won't be presenting but the three track winners and the grand prize winner will be presenting. So in no particular order, runner ups are key. A micro lending platform on substrate that uses chainlink price feeds to convert blockchain tokens to USD for off chain websites like Kiva. Congratulations.
00:38:56.780 - 00:39:40.852, Speaker A: Key parametric water level insurance congratulations to parametric water level me. They are a parametric insurance application for the marine insurance industry that uses Chainlink to retrieve current water level data. Again, they built an external adapter hosted it on market link. If you want to build an external adapter, definitely recommend you take that avenue and post it on market link as well. It's a great place to share your creativity. The next one is Golden Star swap, an Ethereum harmony cross chain swap dap that uses chain link price feeds to swap ETH for ERC 20 tokens into the native harmony token one. Congratulations Golden Star swap.
00:39:40.852 - 00:40:23.196, Speaker A: And next is fruity market. Fruity market was a fruit vending machine application that enables USD denominated payments in ETH using Chainlink's ETH USD price feed. Congratulations there, there was an integration with the argent wallet so argent wallet integration that uses chainlink price feeds to calculate the user determined daily limits for outgoing transactions. Congratulations to argent wallet here, chain draw, a Twitter bot that uses Chainlink VRF to randomly select a winner on chain from a pool of users who retweeted a particular tweet. You can actually go test it out right now on Twitter. I've done it myself as well into TV. So congratulations there they are.
00:40:23.196 - 00:41:06.404, Speaker A: A peer to peer live streaming platform that uses Chainlink VRF to generate unique QR codes uses tickets to access live streams. So a really unique way to use the chainlink VRF to generate these unique QR codes. So really exciting there. Well done into TV. Dexgroves is the next runner up here, a decentralized escrow app for swapping bitcoin and ETH that uses Chainlink oracles to query bitcoin address balances to ensure there are sufficient funds. Congratulations there. Re NFT, an NFT rental marketplace leveraging chainlink price feeds to fetch current NFT market prices from Opensea.
00:41:06.404 - 00:41:45.744, Speaker A: Congratulations there. Take and stop a stop loss contract using gelato and Chainlink price feeds that executes automatically when asset prices reach a target level. Congratulations there. The Feldmex variance swaps a variance swap platform that uses Chainlink price feeds to calculate an asset pairs variance from the current fair market price. Congratulations there. And then the last one of our runner ups is D REIT, a tokenized real estate platform that uses Chainlink to access real estate properties surface area data. And they also built an external adapter.
00:41:45.744 - 00:42:10.924, Speaker A: So really exciting there. Fantastic work. Just super floored by the response that we got here. Again, like I said, we had to bump up the number of runner ups and we had to give out this extra link prize because there were so many submissions here. So those were the run ups. Thank you so much. Congratulations to everybody who participated there and sent in a valid submission.
00:42:10.924 - 00:42:49.612, Speaker A: So with that we have reached the main event here. We have reached the Chainlink track winners and the best overall project. So I just wanted to say one more time. I know we've said it many times. There were really so many fantastic projects here. I'm really excited to keep connecting with everybody. I know everybody else who works on the Chainlink project is really excited to keep connecting here, keep fostering this creativity, and keep building these smart contract platforms that are bringing us to this better place and just bring us this more creative, more trustless, just better world.
00:42:49.612 - 00:43:32.852, Speaker A: So just really excited by the creativity here, by the engineers and really excited to keep going and keep pushing. So with that being said, we are going to go over our three tracks now. Best open project, best d five project, and best gaming NFT project. And we are actually going to start with the best open project in the chain link hackathon winning $4,000 in link here. And the winner of the best open track is the open library project. So open library project, I believe both of you are here. Aaron.
00:43:32.916 - 00:43:35.912, Speaker F: And, hey, yeah, I'm here.
00:43:35.966 - 00:43:39.004, Speaker A: And Armin. How are you guys doing? Welcome. We're doing well.
00:43:39.042 - 00:43:39.944, Speaker F: Hey, Patrick.
00:43:40.072 - 00:43:50.350, Speaker A: Awesome. So I will let these two do justice to their project and do a quick five minute explanation of their project. Again, congratulations. Really excited to have you here.
00:43:51.120 - 00:43:53.936, Speaker F: Is there a way you can let us have video going?
00:43:54.118 - 00:43:56.732, Speaker A: Yeah, we're not in the same spot.
00:43:56.796 - 00:44:00.496, Speaker G: Because I'm actually separated, but so ROMs has the hardware for it.
00:44:00.678 - 00:44:14.580, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do that. I believe you guys should have access now.
00:44:14.730 - 00:44:16.116, Speaker F: All right, cool. Hey, everyone.
00:44:16.218 - 00:44:17.510, Speaker A: I'll let you take it away.
00:44:18.440 - 00:44:18.864, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:44:18.922 - 00:44:19.144, Speaker G: Cool.
00:44:19.182 - 00:45:31.864, Speaker F: So I'm Aram. I worked on this project with Aaron, but I'm just going to kind of take you through some of the inspiration for it and then we'll do a quick demo, just like, show you what it's all about. Basically, we started the hackathon really excited about peer to peer rentals and how Chainlink could enable kind of physical trust and sharing between individuals. I think one of the light bulb moments for us was Aaron really likes biking and I wanted to go on a bike ride with him, but I don't have a bike here in Berkeley, so I had to message all my friends and really, it was kind of an annoying process to try and scalp a bike from someone else. We thought, like, wow, it would be great if we could leverage the built in trust that blockchain offers with physical hardware and sensors to create trusted peer to peer sharing. Kind of like Airbnb, just for a lot of other things, but this is a massive problem. We knew we couldn't tackle it in three weeks, so we picked books as kind of this tractable peer to peer lending model, and we decided to build off the existing infrastructure of little free library.
00:45:31.864 - 00:46:11.870, Speaker F: If you're not familiar with the project, basically it's these little boxes that you see along the streets where you can put a book in, take a book out, totally free, totally open, and it's all individual, community run. I've loved this project for a while. I just really like reading and we thought it's a great opportunity to build some smart software for it. So that's a lot of the inspiration for where open library came from. And yeah, without further ado, I can show you exactly what we built. So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen now. I'll get zoom out of the way.
00:46:11.870 - 00:46:34.848, Speaker F: So on the left here is our web interface. It's just a basic. Let me get this part out of the way. It's just a basic check in checkout interface. So I'm going to connect my wallet through metamask. And now also to explain what's on the right. This is our external adapter that's running an RFID scanner.
00:46:34.848 - 00:47:16.476, Speaker F: The basic flow of the system is that on the web interface you'll initiate a check in or check out, and that goes through a smart contract and chain link node to get a scan from our RFID reader. It's hooked up on my desk right here, out of frame, but that's the server running the external adapter. So I'm going to go ahead and just do kind of like a general flow of what we expect it to be. I have this book here, radical markets. It's a great crypto book, highly recommend it. And I'm going to add it to the library. So I have this RFID card that I'm going to scan and hopefully add it to the library.
00:47:16.476 - 00:47:55.760, Speaker F: Now this loading bar is just waiting for a fixed time, really what you want to look for on the right here is the RFID reader firing up. And there we go. So that was going from smart contract through the chainlink node to an external adapter. Now that the book's in the library, I'm going to go ahead and check it out. And this is the exact same logic. We're just initiating a scan and all of the check in checkout mapping is handled in Ethereum smart contracts. So I'm going to go ahead and wait a bit.
00:47:55.760 - 00:48:31.722, Speaker F: And now that I've scanned, I'm just going to give it a second. There's some delays here, but when I click update rentals I had introducing Python checked out. You can never know too much Python. And there you go. So I checked out radical markets and we see this as a great way that you can basically create a smart software layer for the little free libraries. And we're really excited about where we could take this project. We think there's a lot of community engagement features we could build.
00:48:31.722 - 00:48:41.360, Speaker F: And yeah, we're just really excited that Chainlink liked our project too. So, yeah, hopefully all you are doing well and yeah, I'll throw it back to Patrick. Thank you.
00:48:44.850 - 00:49:04.694, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you both so much for being here and presenting. Like they just said, really unique project, really creative way to do this. Hardware integration as well, to rent out these library books. This is something I don't think I've seen. I don't think a lot of the other judges saw as well. So really creative use case here.
00:49:04.694 - 00:49:29.210, Speaker A: Congratulations on winning the best open project. And let me give you a little retroactive drum roll here, because I actually didn't give you a drum roll. So if we were ever to edit this video, just place that right before I introduce them. So congratulations again. That was a really creative project. Really fantastic. So well done.
00:49:29.210 - 00:49:56.440, Speaker A: Well done. And then moving on, the next prize we had was the best gaming NFT project. So this was the project that built something with NFTs, built something really creative with gaming. One or the other or both, whatever they wanted to do. So just looking for the most creative, most interesting, most adaptive project here. And the best gaming or NFT project goes to. Drumroll, please.
00:49:56.440 - 00:50:15.180, Speaker A: Farm together. So farm together. Congratulations. Farm together was a team of four. Irvin, John, Tina, and Caitlin. Congratulations. I believe we have them as panelists here.
00:50:16.430 - 00:50:18.170, Speaker C: Thank you very much. Patrick.
00:50:18.670 - 00:50:21.242, Speaker A: Hey, congratulations. How are you?
00:50:21.376 - 00:50:24.000, Speaker C: I'm doing quite well, I think. Rest of my teammates are online.
00:50:25.650 - 00:50:35.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I see they're all here too. Maybe they're being a little bit shy. Oh, we're getting them slowly. I see Tina, I see Caitlin, maybe John here.
00:50:35.544 - 00:51:26.138, Speaker C: John is so. Yeah, thank you very much. We're really excited to really build it. So for the chainlink hackathon, we built the first ever no loss yield farming RPG, and we call it farm together. And so the goal really was to gamify the way that people can yield farm and also try to make it more mainstream. So what better way than to actually yield farm than through a virtual game which emulates some of the famous farming games, such as Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. But contrary to these games where you put all these effort, just chopping trees and farming and harvesting your crops without any actual reward and farm together, your actual crop yields can actually earn you real yields or interest, which is generated through an abe pool.
00:51:26.138 - 00:51:34.190, Speaker C: So we have an accelerated demo on death pose, but I'll run everyone through the game briefly, and then we'll jump into the smart contracts and talk about the future.
00:51:34.280 - 00:51:40.790, Speaker A: So I'm going to go ahead and share my screenplay.
00:51:50.190 - 00:52:34.882, Speaker C: So the game itself is really similar to how pull together works. So you have to go ahead and connect to Metamask, let's just say really quick. Then you have to go ahead and stake in this scenario, I'm going to go ahead and stake 100 die. So I'm going to go ahead and approve. Let's wait a few seconds. Ready? Now I have to stake. That should come out.
00:52:34.936 - 00:52:35.540, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:38.890 - 00:53:18.442, Speaker C: Let me just go ahead and full screen it. And so once you enter the game, you have to select a plot of land. I'm going to go ahead with one a and then we're going to sign this transaction. Sign it is going to take us right away through the game. And so, similar to other games, you're going to have to go ahead and go around. You could do things like really cleaning up your farm, because you have to go ahead and start farming. And so at the beginning of the game, you're assigned a set of random seats, and each seat has a set of random properties.
00:53:18.442 - 00:53:58.820, Speaker C: But additionally, when you go ahead and purchase the land, the land itself also has specific properties, which we'll discuss when we look at the smart contracts really quick. So this is just a quick demo. We're going to go ahead and farm. And so at the top part, you see that the time is really passing by. And really, we built the game so that it's a seven day tournament. So essentially along the way, you're going to have to come back and water your plants, and you're going to have to add things like additives and other things. So I'm going to go ahead and show the fast forward version of the game.
00:53:59.670 - 00:54:00.820, Speaker D: Hello, everyone.
00:54:08.060 - 00:55:03.340, Speaker C: So once you come back, the plants start really growing along the way. It's already on day three, Wednesday and so on and up until the very last day when essentially your crops are really ready to be harvested. So in this scenario, they have already been harvested, so we go ahead and pick them up. And so currently in the game, what we actually do is we can go ahead and grab these harvested crops, and essentially we're going to go check the properties that the field had, the land had, and the nutrients. And then we're going to go ahead and trade them for an NFT that represents the actual harvest. Now, once the tournament wraps up, we're going to go ahead and compare everyone else's crop yields. And so depending on whoever took care of their actual crops the most, and also a bit of randomness will take home the price overall.
00:55:03.340 - 00:55:28.870, Speaker C: So this is the trading post. They're going to go ahead and see the score, then there's going to be a reveal method and it'll be minted. So just for brevity, I'm going to go ahead and switch to the smart contract. So I'll let John talk a bit about that because I think that's really exciting work and it's a bit complex too. So, John, you want to go ahead and take it away?
00:55:33.320 - 00:55:37.140, Speaker A: Sure. Did you want to go through the diagram?
00:55:38.940 - 00:55:41.130, Speaker C: Sure, if you want to go ahead and run through it.
00:55:43.260 - 00:56:48.590, Speaker A: Okay, so essentially our smart contract system for this whole game is kind of organized around multiple interacting contracts. The primary is, as you can see, in the middle of the gaming contract in this is what the user interact with. Interacts with two stake plants, harvest and withdraw. As you can see, the user deposits die. And for each game, the game contract itself actually creates a unique pool contract. This pool basically holds the die, deposits it, and then holds a die until the game is finished, in which it will be scheduled to withdraw and give back and allow users to withdraw the initial stake. And if they possess the correct NFTs with the right score, withdraw interest.
00:56:48.590 - 00:56:51.870, Speaker A: So.
00:56:54.720 - 00:56:56.232, Speaker G: So the pool.
00:56:56.376 - 00:58:01.540, Speaker A: So pool. The game itself relies on force chain link and two important features, which is the random, verified random function and the chain link alarm clock. And the alarm clock essentially works to schedule a VRF as entropy at the end of each game, which modulates any user's farming yield. This combined with the actual strategy in which a user is given a, has to choose and plot down with specific properties. And then they need specific seeds that have affinity for those properties are combined to give us the game. NFT themselves are represented as a multifungible ERC one one five token.
00:58:02.280 - 00:58:28.508, Speaker C: So in the near future, essentially what we'd imagine is people being able to trade this sort of seeds in between each other to really match some of the properties of the land itself. So kind of like secondary market or essentially be able to wrap them as DRC 20 tokens and list them on uniswap even as well. But I think. Patrick, do we have a minute or two?
00:58:28.674 - 00:58:30.408, Speaker A: Yeah, you can go for another minute.
00:58:30.584 - 00:58:38.160, Speaker C: Okay, so I think I'm just going to go ahead and jump about really about our future for this game and hand it over to Tina and Caitlin.
00:58:44.100 - 00:59:29.250, Speaker D: We plan to have the seed collection and training, like open market, that people could treat their seeds and also people could like, players could sell crops or help their friends for their farms. And also there's very interesting, we plan to have a game within the game, for example, like fishing competitions, who get the most fish, who win, they can get extra tokens in that. And also we plan to use the same non loss the game structure that we could do, the restaurant simulation game. Also, the restaurant simulation game could be a game within the game, so players could open their restaurant in the game.
00:59:30.500 - 01:00:17.456, Speaker C: Essentially, one of the key things is that if we're able to build a game within the game, then the actual stake die or the representation of the NFT can actually be restaked within the game. And there's many different ways for the user even to gain more interest if they're playing a game within the actual game. There's also other things that we're discussing as well, such as building different kinds of worlds. So you can actually collect these NFTs, which are backed by Dai, and being able to use it among different multiple worlds and also some multiplayer interaction overall. But feel free to follow us online and keep in touch with the project. We're definitely going to build this and take this into mainnet pretty soon. So thank you very much for your support and for watching, everyone.
01:00:17.558 - 01:00:22.290, Speaker A: Thank you. Kaylin, I think you were going to say something too.
01:00:24.900 - 01:00:29.072, Speaker D: No, Urban ended up saying it, so it's fine. Okay, thank you.
01:00:29.206 - 01:00:38.936, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much. Farm together. Tina, I see that chain link shirt. That is fantastic. Thank you all so much for being here. This is a really exciting project. So thank you and well done.
01:00:38.936 - 01:00:39.770, Speaker A: Farm together.
01:00:42.810 - 01:00:43.800, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:00:44.810 - 01:00:46.118, Speaker D: Thank you, everyone.
01:00:46.284 - 01:01:02.714, Speaker A: All right, thanks. So next we have our best Defi project. Our best defi project here. As farm together. As farm together jumps off here. Awesome. So next is our best defi project.
01:01:02.714 - 01:01:36.120, Speaker A: But yeah, again, farm together. Really creative stuff here. They built this entire game around yield farming, something we definitely haven't seen before. And it just shows you can really build using kind of any technology when it comes to smart contracts and when it comes to Chainlink, they were able to connect their project to smart contracts super easily using Chainlink here. So the next is our best defi project. So the best decentralized finance project. Let me pull up my drumroll here.
01:01:36.120 - 01:01:53.450, Speaker A: And the best decentralized finance chainly project goes to shield team Shield and Emmerich. Congratulations to shield and Emmerich.
01:01:53.950 - 01:01:54.970, Speaker G: Hi, thanks.
01:01:55.120 - 01:01:55.882, Speaker A: Hello. Welcome.
01:01:55.936 - 01:01:56.526, Speaker F: Can you hear me?
01:01:56.548 - 01:01:58.702, Speaker A: Well, we can hear you. Thank you for being here.
01:01:58.756 - 01:03:01.370, Speaker G: Okay, perfect. So let me start by thanking you for the price and I hope that you like this proposition to the hackathon. So when searching for IDs for this hackathon, I found the app called Flight, which was the third place winner of the 2019 chain Link hackathon. The idea was to offer flight insurance to travelers based on their smart contract, using Chainlink to call the flight status API. So if the API returned that the flight insurance had been canceled or delayed, then the smart contract would automatically compensate the traveler. I really like this idea of making really fully automated insurance and thought I would make something similar, especially in the field of package shipping. So my first idea was to develop something similar for package shipping, but then I went on developing this ID and thought of another insurance IDs that would be like a life insurance.
01:03:01.370 - 01:03:27.560, Speaker G: And then I went on and on with more and more IDs about new insurance and I couldn't decide which one to implement. So I thought at some point, well, why not implement them all and make them available in the marketplace? And that's what shield is. So let me share my screen to show you desktop. Okay, wait, I can't share right now. Sorry.
01:03:39.690 - 01:03:49.900, Speaker A: He's just restarting to get his screen sharing permissions here. So we're just going to give Emerick a minute here. I believe he is back now.
01:03:51.630 - 01:03:58.746, Speaker G: Yep, sorry about that. I had to restart to provide sharing capabilities to look to zoom.
01:03:58.858 - 01:03:59.854, Speaker A: No worries. Welcome back.
01:03:59.892 - 01:04:33.990, Speaker G: Okay, should be fine. Okay, here we go. So this is shield and this is the insurance marketplace. So far I have three insurance which are three separated smart contracts, one for shipping insurance, one for life insurance, and one for flight insurance. Each of them are based on an oracle with Chainlink. So the shipping insurance is using Chainlink to connect to trackingmore.com, which is a shipping API.
01:04:33.990 - 01:05:17.530, Speaker G: The life insurance is connecting to legacies.com obituary API, and the flight insurance is connected to the flight stats API to get the flight status. So the idea is that each insurance have compensation that is based on the premium of the user. So for example, the shipping insurance has a 1000% of premium. So let's purchase it. So here you can enter the tracking number of the package and the amount that you want to put as a premium. So for example, let's say zero etters.
01:05:17.530 - 01:06:16.056, Speaker G: And since the compensation is 1000%, you would receive 1.2 etters if the package get lost so I can purchase this and that's it. Now I will be ensured. If the tracking more API returns at some point that my package has been lost, I will automatically get my one punctuators and I have something similar also for the life insurance with this time 50,000% of premium and 700% of premium for the flight insurance. And you can also notice a little funded status here. For example, the shipping insurance is funded with 4.2 acres, meaning that if I try to purchase an insurance that goes higher than this funded status, for example, if I say one heter and my compensation would be ten heares, then the insurance cannot be purchased because there is not enough fund in this pool.
01:06:16.056 - 01:07:21.264, Speaker G: So at this point you may ask how can we fund pools then? So for this I implemented automated liquidity pool. So you can go in the menu here and then click on provide liquidity and this time you see the three insurance again, but this time with annualized yield percentage for each of them. And for example the shipping insurance has currently a 6% annualized yield and I can provide liquidity to it. So for example, if I provide one ETR I would receive 0.6 returns on my investment. So let's do this and I'm sending one ETR and so now this etair will be added to the liquidity pool of this insurance and I can take my share of profits from this insurance if it is profitable. So there is a risk indeed involved because if the insurance is not profitable you may lose your liquidity.
01:07:21.264 - 01:08:07.600, Speaker G: For example the flight insurance here we can see that has no more funds and cannot be purchased. So one last thing also is that I want this marketplace to be open for anyone to add a new contract. So for that here you can see that you can create a new insurance. This is not functional yet, but I already created the interface for it. So for this I created ERC 31 42 which is the interface to create your own shield smart contract that can be added to the marketplace. So if you have an idea of an azure insurance that you would like to create, this is the interface that you could implement and add to the marketplace.
01:08:08.740 - 01:08:10.164, Speaker C: I think that's it.
01:08:10.362 - 01:08:11.750, Speaker G: Do you have any questions?
01:08:14.280 - 01:08:39.064, Speaker A: Awesome. So we're a little bit short on time, so we actually don't have time for questions, but his project is on Dev post, you can see his user is over there, so if you have questions feel free to reach out. Really exciting. This was a fantastic project. Thank you so much for submitting and thank you so much for being here thanks. Awesome. So with that, that is our three track winners.
01:08:39.064 - 01:09:15.828, Speaker A: That is the farm together project, the open library project shield. Again, there were just so many fantastic projects here. And that's just an awesome showcase of this insurance marketplace that also had an automated market maker. There's really unlimited creativity that you can go about building with Chainlink and building these smart contracts out. So just another huge round of applause there for each one of these participants. And without further ado, that leads us with our last final prize here. So this was the grand prize winner of the chain Link hackathon.
01:09:15.828 - 01:10:01.924, Speaker A: The grand prize, again is $8,000 in links. This was just the best overall project. This is the project that the judges thought was the most creative, most applicable, most unique in every way and technically challenging. So without further ado, we would like to announce the grand prize winner of the chain Link hackathon. And we will do another drum roll for this prize as well. So the winner of the chain link 2020 hackathon goes to link my ride. Harry and Matt, congratulations on winning the chain link hackathon 2020 grand prize.
01:10:01.924 - 01:10:04.010, Speaker A: I believe you both are here.
01:10:08.300 - 01:10:09.332, Speaker G: Hi, Patrick.
01:10:09.396 - 01:10:09.784, Speaker H: Thank you.
01:10:09.822 - 01:10:10.760, Speaker G: Yep, we're.
01:10:13.900 - 01:10:14.404, Speaker H: Chain.
01:10:14.452 - 01:10:44.470, Speaker G: Thank you, Patrick. Thank you, Chainlink and all the other judges. And congrats to all the other winners as well. We're very grateful to have won a prize in this hackathon. And just quickly, thank you to Matt and also Duncan, the local Tesla, President of the local Tesla car club here for helping me out in this submission. So just quickly, I'll just give a brief overview and then Matt will do a quick demo. So basically, let me share my screen.
01:10:44.470 - 01:11:37.270, Speaker G: So Linkmyride is a peer to peer decentralized Tesla rental platform where Tesla owners can rent out their vehicle for a short amount of time to other people. But what it really is, or I guess the inspiration behind it is we just wanted to do something that was really cool. We wanted to do something that would show off Chainlink, and we wanted to do something that would get people excited about building things and kind of connecting smart contracts to external data and events. And in this case, we thought Tesla was really cool because it's got such a feature rich API that can literally do anything to the car. It can open the trunk, you can remote start it, you can wake it up, you can unlock it, et cetera. So I thought the two chainlink and Tesla went together really well. So that's kind of why we decided to pursue that.
01:11:37.270 - 01:12:16.160, Speaker G: So in terms of how we built it, there's quite a few moving pieces to the puzzle here. So just quickly, the official Tesla mobile app connects via some Tesla servers to the vehicle. So that's how Tesla owners can do these kinds of things to their cars. So we built an external adapter hosted in Google Cloud to send these requests to the Tesla servers. And we use a Google firestore serverless database to retrieve and store these API token keys that are required to do these requests to the Tesla. I actually really like this part here. I think it's really cool.
01:12:16.160 - 01:12:51.096, Speaker G: And we have a chainlink node hosted also on the cloud. And we have an AWS lambda function that the web app uses to send requests to add vehicles to the node. And of course, we have an on chain component where the rental agreements all get generated and managed. And of course, the chainlink node interacts with that as well. So that's kind of it for me. It's a little bit early here in Australia to be hanging around in car parks, so I might hand it over to Matt. And we've got a demo where it's hooked up to a mock server to mimic the official Tesla servers.
01:12:51.096 - 01:12:53.550, Speaker G: And Matt will give you a quick demo now.
01:12:55.440 - 01:13:06.280, Speaker H: Great. Thank you, Harry. Cool. Can you see my screen?
01:13:07.850 - 01:13:09.074, Speaker A: Yep, looks good.
01:13:09.212 - 01:13:31.794, Speaker H: Cool. Yeah, I guess. Firstly, thank you to everybody involved in making the hackathon possible. It's been really fun to participate in. So, yeah, this is the front end for our application. We have two avenues that you can go through when you hit the home page. Sorry.
01:13:31.794 - 01:14:18.098, Speaker H: So as a vehicle owner, you're able to come here and register your vehicle in the application. So if I go here to the add vehicle form, I'm able to select the currency that I also want to use here. So if I say, let's switch to GBP. Okay. So, yeah, we're currently using kind of a mock Tesla server. So I can add any vehicle really here, and it will be approved. So if I just enter some details, let's say I want my hourly hire fee to be 30 pounds per hour.
01:14:18.098 - 01:14:47.850, Speaker H: I want the bond to be 150 pounds. I enter my vehicle ID and my Tesla API key. So, yeah, if you're a Tesla owner, you'd be able to get these from Tesla yourself. And I can select where I want my vehicle to be stationed. So where I want it to be picked up from and brought back to. So let's say I want it over in Tranmere. So I submit my vehicle.
01:14:47.850 - 01:15:34.506, Speaker H: So, yeah, I can approve this transaction, and after that has gone through, I should be redirected. Here we are. It says, confirm transaction. So we can see here that the vehicle is pending a request will have been made via that lambda function to the chainlink node with the credentials that I provided. So really this would go off to Tesla server to verify that this vehicle exists. And as you can see, it comes back with approved. This is just going to mock server.
01:15:34.506 - 01:16:01.960, Speaker H: So I could put any details in there. Cool. So if I switch over to my other browser where I'm going to enter the app as the vehicle renter. So I select to create a rental contract. I can again pick a different currency here. So let's say USD. I want to rent it now for 1 hour.
01:16:01.960 - 01:16:43.766, Speaker H: And here it is over here in Tranmere. Here's the vehicle that was added on the other account. So I can now send a request to the car owner. So at this point I'm paying the full amount that's required into the contract. So once that's gone, so I should also be redirected back. Here we are. So my rental contract has appeared here.
01:16:43.766 - 01:17:15.550, Speaker H: It's now in a proposed status. So it's now up to the vehicle owner to approve or deny this. So if I switch back to the other browser, so I'm on the owner dashboard here, I can see this rental contract has appeared. Let's go ahead and approve that. That's gone through. This is polling for updates. There we are, approved.
01:17:15.550 - 01:17:52.400, Speaker H: If I switch back to rental one. There we are. Sorry, it has updated. Approved there. So now I can go ahead and when I'm ready to activate the car, ready to take it away, I can activate it through here. Confirm here. So once this has been activated, the car will unlock and I'm free to take it away.
01:17:52.400 - 01:19:03.910, Speaker H: It's worth noting that seeing as the ethereum was paid into the contract at the point where the rental contract was created, any price fluctuations from there on obviously won't affect the amount of ethereum that's given back to the renter and the owner at the end of the contract. I believe Harry is just making a request to the mock server just to change the details. So we're going to simulate someone taking the car away and maybe not quite playing by the rules so there may be a penalty. So yeah, I brought my car back. I want to end the contract now. Confirm that. And that's been confirmed.
01:19:03.910 - 01:19:35.510, Speaker H: This should update. Fingers crossed to say that the contracts have been completed in the real world. This would lock the car. You can see in the YouTube video that we attached to the dev post where we did a demo with a real vehicle. Should be updating, but I'll just give it a refresh. Here we are. So now we can see that the contract is completed.
01:19:35.510 - 01:20:13.426, Speaker H: You can see the stats from where the vehicle started and you can see that I've left it 45 km. That doesn't sound quite right. But anyway, it's not where it started anyway, so you can see that there's been a penalty. Sorry, I can switch the currency here so we can see it in USD. There we are. We can see that some of the bond has been returned, but there was a penalty here, a penalty on the charge of the vehicle as well. As you can see, it lost 25% of the charge.
01:20:13.426 - 01:21:09.580, Speaker H: It wasn't returned with the same level of charge. And there's the rent payable. That's it for the demo. If we were to take this further, we could do some more work around the security because I guess at the moment the API keys could be secured better. I don't know if there's maybe potential for Deco to improve that as well in the future. We could add features to facilitate managing a fleet of vehicles, including reporting analytics. So it could potentially be someone's business in the future if they've got a lot of spare capital to buy up a bunch of Teslas and let them out using this platform.
01:21:09.580 - 01:21:29.600, Speaker H: There's also some work required to make sure that the financial incentive for the owner and the renter are sufficient that both are going to behave. That's the end of the demo. Thank you.
01:21:31.270 - 01:22:06.070, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, Matt and Harry. Just a really unique project. Really exciting, really different, right? Like they built an external adapter for Tesla, just kind of showing you all the customizability that you can do with Chainlink. So before closing out here, I just wanted to give a couple more shout outs. First off, shout out again to all these projects. I'm keeping a really professional tone here, but it's so exciting to see all the creativity and the engineering prowess that goes into some of these projects.
01:22:06.070 - 01:22:33.294, Speaker A: I mean, that one that we just saw, it was a decentralized platform to rent out your car. How awesome and cool is that? We don't see something like that in mainstream. We see it at the stomping grounds here, we see it at this birthplace of innovation. And it's just so exciting. We saw a game that let you yield farm. You can play a video game, you can play a game and yield farm from that game. It's just so exciting.
01:22:33.294 - 01:23:14.510, Speaker A: You can. Decentralized insurance platform. Imagine going to an insurance website and it being a platform of decentralized insurance sites with its own automated market maker. With it all these are things we don't see in the mainstream and are just insanely cool, insanely creative, and just brand new open library project, decentralized renting library books. Just really exciting projects here that get me so excited. And I know we've got a lot of other engineers and other people here excited, too. So just another huge shout out to all the projects who submitted.
01:23:14.510 - 01:23:52.938, Speaker A: Again, there were so many fantastic projects, it was so hard to choose, which is why, like I said, this isn't something we always do or it's something we've never done before. We felt we needed to give out seven link because there were so many creatives, so many fantastic submissions. So just another huge round of applause for all the projects who showed up, everybody who built, everyone who participated. Thank you so much for being a part of the community. Thank you for fostering this innovation and pushing these smart contracts and pushing chainlink to this next evolution. So thank you so much. We need to give another shout out to all the amazing sponsors.
01:23:52.938 - 01:24:42.762, Speaker A: They spent time to give out these prizes as well, to give some of the demos, to teach us how to build on top of their platforms and to really make this collaborative effort of building really interesting things. So a huge shout out to all of our sponsors who participated. Another big thank you to our judging panel. The judging panel was a little bit more. We didn't get to see or interact with them as much, but definitely check out the dev post. We had a ton of just fantastic judges, really titans in the industry, titans of blockchain, titans of cryptocurrency, who looked at your projects, who gave us feedback on the projects, who were the ones that said, okay, these are the ones that are fantastic. These are the ones that are really good.
01:24:42.762 - 01:25:29.158, Speaker A: And they were also some of the ones who said, hey, you know what? This is really tough. This is really tough for us to pick some of these projects. Can we do anything more? And that's how we said, you know what? Yes. We absolutely need to do something more. And again, it's not something that we always do and it's not something that we've ever done, but because it was so fantastic, so huge thank you to the judges here. I also wanted to give a massive shout out and a massive thank you to a lot of the team members who put this on, who spent a lot of time in the discord, in meetings with myself and meetings with some of everybody here that being kind of, namely Keenan, Rory, Diana, Adeline, Sergey, Oliver, and a number of other people, Julian, for building the website. Thank you so much, Chris.
01:25:29.158 - 01:26:20.126, Speaker A: For putting out a lot of the tweets. And just thank you to a lot of the team members who, behind the scenes, we didn't get to see them as much, but they put in a ton of effort to make this the success that it was. So a massive thank you to all the team members behind the scenes, and just a massive thank you to the community as a whole. It's because we have so many engineers and we have such a wonderful community that we got such fantastic feedback and such a fantastic response for the tackathon. So just another huge thank you to you. Thank you to everybody for being here right now to see some of the prizes and see some of the products that won in the next week. Like I said, we're going to be reaching out, sending out those feedback forms which will ask for a clean ETH wallet at the bottom to get that seven link per project.
01:26:20.126 - 01:26:56.006, Speaker A: And we'll be coordinating with the winning projects as well to assist moving forward. Again, anybody who is interested in writing and doing a little bit more, getting a little bit more involved with smart contracts, with Chainlink, definitely reach out, definitely ping in the discord. We love interacting. We love chatting with everybody. So just really excited to keep the conversation going. Really excited to see where some of these projects go, and really excited to see everybody at the next hackathon and continuing in the discord as well. So without further ado, I wanted to just give one more big thank you.
01:26:56.006 - 01:27:13.290, Speaker A: I know I've said many thank yous, but just one more big thank you to everybody for being a part of this, and we'll see you next hackathon. Congratulations to all the projects as well. And with that, we will sign off and sign out. Good night. Bye.
