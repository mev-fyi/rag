00:00:05.450 - 00:00:23.946, Speaker A: So I'm just super excited to have you all on stage. And I think, you know, there's so much that we can really explore at the intersection of art and AI in particular. But I have to say one thing for Lenara. Is it data? Gan actually has a Twitter account, and it called you their envoy.
00:00:24.058 - 00:00:33.960, Speaker B: Yes. Here on behalf of dad again, if you want to follow dad again on Twitter, is the real datagun. Don't ask me about the fake ones.
00:00:34.970 - 00:00:56.282, Speaker A: But it's the first time I've seen an AI call a human their envoy. And maybe that's a glimpse to the future. Let's just dive right into it. And I just wanted to ask, first of all, I mean, art is such a subjective thing. And to each of the panelists, really, what is art to you? How do you view art? Maybe we can start with River.
00:00:56.346 - 00:01:02.638, Speaker C: I guess that's a super subjective question. Maybe we can take it in the context of what art is right now.
00:01:02.724 - 00:01:03.022, Speaker A: Sure.
00:01:03.076 - 00:01:47.774, Speaker C: And I think one of the biggest questions over the next 20 years will be, is it human made or is it machine made? And how do we draw the distinction between the two of those? To say, okay, is something that's made with AI art, right? Or does it need a human touch? And I think from a personal perspective, AI is based on humans. And so it is, in fact, making art. And we are contributing to its creation of art. And so whatever it is that is being created, if we're looking from a perspective of, let's say, duchamp. Right. Whatever the artist says is art is art. And I think that's probably where my perspective is on it.
00:01:47.972 - 00:01:48.974, Speaker A: That makes sense.
00:01:49.092 - 00:02:13.400, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I follow you, and I think art is a wonderful social constriction, actually, is made through time, through history, through critics, through our own guts. And, yeah, I think it's an outcome. It's a social outcome, actually, and a personal one as well. And a machine one. Now.
00:02:15.290 - 00:02:40.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have anything much different to say. I think there is a question of, let's say, intent and expression in art. So, like you said, if someone creates art and thinks that's art, that's art, and I would go further into the reception of art. So if someone experiences something and believes that art, that is also art, even if the intent was not to create art.
00:02:41.010 - 00:03:08.310, Speaker A: Interesting. That's very meta. Yeah, I tend to see it a lot as we sometimes confuse art with output. And in my mind, it's like when you combine art and craft to get an output. The art is the expression that comes from within. It's the desire to tell a story, either through words or a picture or something like that. But then that gets combined with the craft, your excellence or your style painting or your style writing or those kind of things.
00:03:08.310 - 00:03:43.518, Speaker A: And then there's an output that comes from that, and then art lives in the eye of the beholder of that output, like you mentioned as well. So I personally believe where the AI enters the art is much more valuable on the craft side of the fence, and it shouldn't really, and as I was sharing earlier on with my experience writing, is that if I use it to help me with the craft, it makes me a far more efficient producer of output as an artist. And I'm just curious for each of you, how has generative AI impacted your art and the types of things that you do? Should we start again with river?
00:03:43.614 - 00:04:29.654, Speaker C: That's fine. So I'm the managing director of technology and art collective. It's intent. So we exist on the forefront of technology and art, and what are the new things that are coming in? And so as AI has become, let's say, more valuable over the past year, it went from a point in time when we were just playing with Gan, right? And it was like, okay, well, this is trash, but it's fun. And then it evolved very rapidly to the point where mid journey dropped their first version publicly. And all of a sudden now I'm like making Salvador Dali chicken nuggets, right? And it's like, okay, it's a little bit more fun, but it's then, you know, fast forward to now. It's like, wow, we know Darakan.
00:04:29.654 - 00:05:30.402, Speaker C: We have botto by Mario Klingman. We have such incredible artists working in the space who are using this technology in very interesting ways. And so for us, we've been trying to look at how do we combine human made and AI made to continue to create something very unique, right? And so something recently that has come out is the diffusion splatting, which is a new thing that's supposed to replace photogrammetry and Lidar. And so what we were able to do was take a project that we had created using sculptures of impossible human forms, and then bring them in and create 3D objects out of them. And then we can bring those into the real world, 3D print them, or use any number of techniques to kind of create an actual physical piece out of that. And so now we have AI sculptures, and the applications expand beyond that infinitely, right. Of combining the human creation with the machine creation.
00:05:30.402 - 00:05:34.198, Speaker C: I think that we have a lot of exploration to do.
00:05:34.364 - 00:05:35.938, Speaker A: Okay, how about Alexandra?
00:05:36.034 - 00:06:23.350, Speaker D: I think it's like evolving. I reckon the first time I use OpenAI, we needed tokens actually to use it. Like GPT wasn't there. And so we started to write as a collective of artists, a manifesto, and then we incorporated OpenAI into the creation of this manifesto. I think it was like 2020, 2021, right? So I think my first direct contact as a creator with AI was through writing, actually. And we were all amazed, right? First time using all the tokens to create this piece of text. And yeah, I remember this time.
00:06:23.350 - 00:07:34.222, Speaker D: I also remember one of the first time I saw at our electronica, the big Digital art festival, an artwork called doing nothing with AI. I think it was like 2018, something like that. It's still a beautiful sculpture. Anyway, I think it was asking like, what about AI, right, what can we do? So, yeah, writing. And then as you mentioned, I think now it's really taking over all our tooling, right? So as a creative director, I also work on creating grand design sometimes, right? Not only my personal creation or collective art project, and so I also use actually like mid journey, stable diffusion, all sort of tools that are helping me actually to do my research. And then I pass it into my other program, right, of creation. So maybe the adobe suit or maybe blender, and blender is now incorporating some AI tooling also.
00:07:34.222 - 00:08:06.678, Speaker D: So the 3D is becoming very important in AI. And also I really love using VR to actually draw. So gravity sketch is an amazing tool for me. I can sketch everything in movement and then exported it into blender, for instance. And then having AI actually helping me with this. So it's cross like border actually right now. Yeah, it's amazing.
00:08:06.844 - 00:08:08.254, Speaker A: It is pretty incredible.
00:08:08.402 - 00:08:11.100, Speaker D: And then the vision for the future.
00:08:11.550 - 00:08:12.662, Speaker A: How about Lanara?
00:08:12.726 - 00:08:28.554, Speaker B: Well, I actually now disagree. I don't think Gan is trash and this is not, I'm not speaking as that, again, envoy right now. I'm just speaking at myself. And I actually think that the art is not in the craft.
00:08:28.682 - 00:08:29.358, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:29.524 - 00:09:16.094, Speaker B: Craft, of course, is integral part of the art, but if you're doing just craft, I think most likely you're not doing art. And of course the craft can be so vast and it can include so many different techniques from history until these days. So I think you can do amazing things. And even right now, if you look at this kind of like vintage Gan art, they are seen as something really important and valuable because they represent that kind of evolution. And of course, that, again, is now using other tools as well. It's not like stuck. The name is stuck because that's what it was using in 2019, but is using all these other tools now, too.
00:09:16.094 - 00:09:16.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:17.012 - 00:10:03.710, Speaker A: For those in the audience who aren't familiar with the term gan, it's a generative adversarial network, which was one of the early precursors for actually generating images. And in my career, I found that when I spell it out to people, I actually scare them when they see the word adversarial. But I agree with your point that craft is an important part of it, but the craft itself isn't the art. But I think from what Alexandra was mentioning, is part of it as well, is a good artist with the right tools can express themselves more quickly and at scale. And it's the at scale part. I'd really be curious to hear your experience, because you're all established artists, you're a well known name in your industry. When you create something, people pay attention.
00:10:03.710 - 00:10:19.362, Speaker A: But given that we're entering this new world now, where these new tools are available for other artists to be able to craft their art, to produce some kind of output, what advice would you give them to become established artists? Maybe we'll start with this.
00:10:19.416 - 00:11:00.078, Speaker B: Right? Okay. Now maybe I can speak at Datagun's envoy, because actually, this is the very goal. Like, the current goal of datagun is to become a successful, established artist. And one thing that data art is this community of artists that I'm part of, and most of the real flesh and bone artists, they struggle a lot with some things that they see as mandatory to be successful. Maybe they have to be a lot on social media. They have to be promoting always what they doing all these things. And their intrinsic motivation is to just create art.
00:11:00.078 - 00:11:48.640, Speaker B: And that's what they do best. And they see all these other tasks as detracting and actually having a bad influence in their art itself. So, Dadagan, because it's not human, it's like a bot can do all that stuff, right, and be trained to do that stuff. So that's kind of really amazing that now someone or it, like datagun, can use the AI tools and be this kind of other Persona that many of the real flesh and bone artists can or don't want or something very different from what they want to do. So I think it's a super interesting experiment in this sense, and I hope that datagun is already doing quite well and being to shows and winning stuff. It's really fun to watch.
00:11:49.490 - 00:11:51.258, Speaker A: It even has a human envoy.
00:11:51.434 - 00:11:54.980, Speaker B: Yes, several, actually. Yeah, I'm just one of them.
00:11:55.430 - 00:11:58.146, Speaker A: So how about Alexandra? What are your thoughts on, like, what.
00:11:58.168 - 00:12:35.280, Speaker D: Would you think I am very interested, and I will mostly ask questions here, not give you any reply. But I'm mostly interested into the concept of incarnation, I guess. In art, we are very fond of seeing an artwork made by this and that guy. Right. This need of incarnating a creation is really something that was here until AI came. Right. And AI is questioning this, and you are questioning this, I think, as well.
00:12:35.280 - 00:13:14.922, Speaker D: So, yeah. Question, do we still need incarnation? And if. Yes, I think for young artists, I would say that what is important also is the context. Right? Like, an artwork is not just like a painting or an image or just a sound, right. It's a complex system with the bio of a person. Right. The historical context, the art critic, that will actually shed some light on it and try to understand the public receiving it.
00:13:14.922 - 00:14:05.882, Speaker D: And so the question I would like actually say to young artists, you also try to find themselves and find a dialectic with the machine somehow, and this is what will help also the public and to understand that it's an actual artwork and it's like a work. So, yeah, I think we tend to lose that. I saw multiple endeavors recently of just machine image created by machines and people voting to see if this image is an art or this image is maybe more an artwork. I was like, how can you think like that? We don't think like that.
00:14:05.936 - 00:14:06.298, Speaker B: Actually.
00:14:06.384 - 00:14:46.626, Speaker D: Our social constriction of art is so complex that it encompass, actually, the person. The letters may be wrote by this artist, and then any kind of interviews gave by this artist, right? So every component of an artwork is very dense, and it's not just the image created by the AI. So I will say to young artists, use the tool and try to find your own dialectic with the machine, and try to find your own self, actually, for this dialectic.
00:14:46.738 - 00:14:48.650, Speaker A: Beautiful advice. Yes. How about.
00:14:48.800 - 00:14:51.850, Speaker C: I think my suggestion would be study the documentation.
00:14:54.750 - 00:14:56.090, Speaker A: RTFM, right?
00:14:56.160 - 00:15:34.098, Speaker C: Yeah. My first comment was, I made gan art. It was cool. But mine personally, I thought was trash because I didn't do enough research into the documentation on understanding the system of how I would get something that I felt represented myself in a good way. And so there's tons of documentation. Something that's super helpful now is I can take something like chat GBT three, and I can plug it in with, like, blender documentation. And now, all of a sudden, I can speed up my education workflow, because this is one of the most difficult things as an artist is when you're doing something that becomes very difficult, you have a lot of friction.
00:15:34.098 - 00:16:21.238, Speaker C: And when you have a lot of friction, it reduces your capacity to create. And so artists who have done the practice for a really long time, they can move very quickly within the softwares, within Photoshop or illustrator or blender or within any of these different programs, because they've been there for so long. Right. And so as a new artist, that friction of not knowing and having to stop and go and research and study this new thing takes you out of the creative flow. So if you can use these new AI systems to actually help you learn them faster, now, all of a sudden, you've put yourself in a position to take advantage of what's happening at a high velocity and to be able to effectively execute your vision. And I think that that's a really powerful thing to have.
00:16:21.404 - 00:17:11.430, Speaker A: Yeah. Beautifully said. Thank you. And I think one of the things that there's two major elephants in the room when it comes to this, and it's like that sometimes are driving the debate in a negative direction, and I'd love your thoughts on them. The first of these elephants in the room, of course, is the fact that now that anybody can go to mid journey and type in something and get something beautiful out, is that devaluing artists because it's flooding the market with new things. And then the second elephant in the room, of course, is that a lot of these models are trained on existing art, and there are examples out there of a particular artist's style being mimicable, if that's a word, and then potentially putting that artist down and removing work from that artist. And as artists yourselves, I'd love to know what your feelings are on this and what you think that the industry should move in, maybe start with.
00:17:11.500 - 00:17:42.902, Speaker B: Right. Well, first of all, actually, from Datagun's perspective, so data art is a platform where people create art. And Datagun is trained on our own data set. It's like 100,000 something, probably almost 200,000 by now. And when artists create these artworks, they create it directly on the platform. So there's no upload or copy paste. Everything is done by the data artists.
00:17:42.902 - 00:18:15.226, Speaker B: And the way we have it since the beginning is that this collective drawing that they're doing belongs to the data commons. So these are the images that datagun uses. So we have no problem whatsoever with any of that. Right. So it's kind of a very unique place, because most of other tools, like you said, had this problem of what the art is saying. And this is a super important, I think, discussion that we should be having right now for mean.
00:18:15.248 - 00:18:19.658, Speaker A: So it sounds like you're already beginning to solve that problem, which is great with your.
00:18:19.824 - 00:18:28.894, Speaker B: I mean, I'm not saying this is like the solution of everything. It's just a particular way that we, our AI artists, doesn't have that problem. Right?
00:18:28.932 - 00:18:31.226, Speaker A: Yep. Yep. Sounds good. How about Alexandra and River?
00:18:31.338 - 00:19:04.394, Speaker D: I think coping was always a question in art. As artists, we're always looking at what we do and like, oh, this is similar to this artist or to that. Is it really me? And we always have this question. I think I have this. I think it's like inherent, actually, to us to be a copy of a copy of a copy. Right. So you have this and you need to be okay and cool with that.
00:19:04.394 - 00:19:32.370, Speaker D: That being said, I think one of the major, also advice is actually to the ecosystem, is to give us more tools to train our models, please. That's what I'm saying. We are really here, by the way, there is a need here. I think that would be like my reply.
00:19:34.230 - 00:20:43.846, Speaker C: For me, it comes down to attribution. I went to university and we used MLA and APA and different style guides. And we were taught to kind of cite our sources. And I think that citing our sources kind of got lost in the world once I went into the professional ecosystem. And so I think blockchain actually has a huge implementation in this to be able to say, okay, if all of the data that was being used to train these sets was stored on the blockchain as verifiable attribution of creation and ownership, now, anyone who uses these things can then have an attribution point to say, okay, here's everything that was used to train this specific piece of art that I then prompted to output or however I used it. Right, and now we have verifiable attribution. But then on the other side, we can use smart contract technology to say, okay, well, if you use this and we publish it on the blockchain and we have attribution, well, now we can have a purchase contract function that pays out a nominal percentage to that data set and to every single one of those artists.
00:20:43.846 - 00:21:03.902, Speaker C: And so maybe that's fractions and fractions of a penny. But if hundreds of millions of people are using this to create things, well, now all of these artists are receiving some level of attribution for their contribution to the training of these models. And I think that's an interesting place that we could potentially move with blockchain technology. Have I seen anyone doing anything like this?
00:21:03.956 - 00:21:08.946, Speaker D: Yes, there is. Mixer is a story, and we have.
00:21:08.968 - 00:21:20.950, Speaker C: IPFs and filecoin who have been kind of paving the way for at least this more nouveau art movement that's happening in the digital space right now. So we'll see where it goes.
00:21:21.020 - 00:22:22.140, Speaker A: You actually beat me to my next question, which was really about that. We're here at a conference around blockchain, and what are some of the ways that it could be useful for artists? And like what you just mentioned, image generation models in particular, there are things called salience models or class activation maps that you can do to take a look at an image generation model and see what it was paying attention to and how it maps various classes to the prompt itself. And then when you train the model, what parts of the data set were used to generate those classes, and then you can pull that one back to actually understand that. Like, you know what? When I generated this image, I took it from 1000 of these images, from my 10 million images in the data set. And here's an approximate weight for each of these. And as the model creator, it might be one third of the revenue goes to me, one third of the revenue goes to the artist, and one third of the revenue goes to charity or something like that. So that then becomes possible, as you point out, that the technology is actually there.
00:22:22.140 - 00:22:42.110, Speaker A: We're still just the very early days of building it, but going beyond technology, or at least beyond that one scenario of technology. How about Alexandrin? What do you think about, are there any ways that we can protect artists or we can raise the value of artists, given the volume of work that's being produced by machines?
00:22:43.350 - 00:23:41.906, Speaker D: I think artists are experimenting the way we can live with machines. So I think we need to pay more attention to the actual interaction between humans, between artists and machines, and AI, actually, because I think artists are always on the edge and experimenting and trying to bootstrap also new behaviors. Right? So I think this is very valuable. Maybe not in term of financial values, but this is very valuable because we are now in the crisis of, like, okay, what are we going to do? Are we going to disappear? What is this super intelligence? Right? So I think artists are somehow paving the way of the place of the human and the machine, and we need to pay attention to that because this is a huge value for humanity, actually.
00:23:42.088 - 00:24:22.414, Speaker A: Absolutely agree. It's. I mean, art has always been there to kind of provide a texture to society, to help us understand it. And as we're moving into a new society, it's the artists living on the bleeding edge of that will really help us to, if we look back to previous times, like Victorian London, what we understand of Victorian London is from the writings of Charles Dickens, that kind of thing, middle age England from the writings of Shakespeare, as we saw earlier on, and stuff like that. And it's like 100 years from now, when people are looking back to try and understand our society, they'll be looking back at what the artists are producing. And also, I think, importantly, how they're producing it. There are phases of watercolors, there are phases of oils, all these kind of things.
00:24:22.414 - 00:24:46.900, Speaker A: And now that we're moving into not just digital art, but artificially generated art using artificial intelligence, you are at the forefront of helping define what our civilization will be remembered. So thank you for sharing your experiences on this panel. I think it's been fascinating. I wish we had another hour or two, because I could talk about this all day, but I just want to say thank you so much. And again, thank you to the audience, really, for.
