00:00:00.680 - 00:00:42.574, Speaker A: So it's very hard to predict for sure what will happen in this space. And for any company within this space, what I can say is that over time, the trend has been constantly up. And when I say up, it means doing more things. It means bringing more changes to the space, working with more partners. So what I can say is that in three years, in five years, we'll probably be working with many, many more institutional capital, market institutions, banks. We'll be working with more defi, we'll be working with more chains. We'll basically be doing much more of what we're doing today.
00:00:42.574 - 00:00:54.464, Speaker A: That's the only trend I've seen constantly happen, and the only thing I can say confidently will happen. It will just be more and more exciting things to build.
