00:00:00.330 - 00:00:53.178, Speaker A: You. We have multiple chain link oracle networks that have now become profitable simply from the point of view of DAP fees. This is a unique and special milestone in my opinion, because many, if not all, blockchain systems rely on something called a block reward. Many of them rely on it to over 98%, with user fees only making up 2%. Some of them rely on it anywhere from 60% to 70%. Some of the more widely used systems we have achieved certain distinct oracle networks. Certain committees of nodes that are able to run so efficiently thanks to OCR, have achieved efficiency because of the efficiency gains of the chains they're on, and have enough user demand happening quickly enough that they have become completely profitable.
00:00:53.178 - 00:00:57.690, Speaker A: They don't require a block reward or an oracle reward of any kind to operate.
