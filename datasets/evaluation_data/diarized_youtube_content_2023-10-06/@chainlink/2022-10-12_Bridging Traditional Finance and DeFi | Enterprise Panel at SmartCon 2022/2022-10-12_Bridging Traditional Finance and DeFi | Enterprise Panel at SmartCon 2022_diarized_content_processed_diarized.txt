00:00:08.650 - 00:00:29.362, Speaker A: Great. Thank you for joining us for this panel. It's very exciting to have so many people from the capital markets that are actually pushing the limit of what's possible. Here with us, Jonathan, Stephen and Victor. I want to thank you for being on this panel and sharing your insights with us. Thank you. Very excited to hear your views on Defi and tokenization.
00:00:29.362 - 00:01:30.760, Speaker A: A whole bunch of awesome topics. I think just to kick this off, we're going to begin talking about cross chain. And in regards to know, just to set the stage, I'm very happy to announce that we are working on an initial proof of concept, together with Swift, on the use of CCIP in the capital markets to enable communications and movement of tokens between a number of different institutions in a way that'll accelerate the adoption of DLT blockchains and benefit various institutions all over the capital markets. In that regard, I think we'll just start discussing cross chain, and I'd be thrilled to hear Jonathan's views on the importance of cross chain and how communication between chains and institutions in a multi chain world could look and work.
00:01:31.290 - 00:01:52.510, Speaker B: Yeah. So thank you, Sergei. Thank you for the invite. Let me start, maybe, because I know not everybody is aware about Swift, but I will try to explain it very quickly. So Swift is a cooperative. It's an international cooperative. We run perhaps the biggest network in financial services today for capital markets, for payments, for FX, for trades.
00:01:52.510 - 00:02:50.046, Speaker B: We are headquartered in Belgium, although we have sort of operations everywhere, and we have around 11,000 banks that are connected to SwiFt today. They exchange financial information in the most secure, reliable and scalable way. All right, so that's what, just to frame it, that the second piece is that the POC that we're doing, it's the end of a long story, right? I think five or seven years ago was the first time Swift and Chainlink started working together. You were actually one of the first startups that we bet on. You won the startup challenge that we used to have a long time ago. And then even before blockchain was something that financial services had in their minds, I don't think at the time, nobody was doing anything on blockchain, on financial services, Swift and Chainlink worked together. On the first PoC that we did on bond issuance and redemption.
00:02:50.046 - 00:03:37.602, Speaker B: It was quite successful. And that was maybe the first steps of this sort of love story between Swift and Chainlink, which continues today. Now, why we want to continue to work today, I think there's two factors that I want to explain. So the first factor is there is undeniable interest from institutional investors into digital assets, whether these are stablecoins, cbdcs, or anything that you can tokenize on capital market space. So that could be equities, bonds or anything else. So those institutional investors, they want to have access to these assets at the same time that they have access to traditional assets. And that means that an asset manager, for example, wants to use the same custodian they use today.
00:03:37.602 - 00:04:17.354, Speaker B: And those custodians probably wants to use the same sub custodians to settle at the same infrastructures that they do today. And that, in theory, means that they want to use a network that can connect to all of these capabilities. And that's where Swift comes into play. So that's the first factor. You have institutional investors saying, hey, Swift, we want you to be the network to connect to that. Now, in reality, connecting to this network for digital assets doesn't mean connecting to same infrastructures. It means that you have to bridge the gap between these infrastructures that have been there for ages and all of these new blockchains that are going to provide these services, whether it's issuance, clearing, trading, settlement of tokenized assets.
00:04:17.354 - 00:05:00.938, Speaker B: And there are going to be many of them. There's already a few of them. Some of them are private, some of them are Ethereum based, some of them are in anything that you can, any fabric that you can imagine, right? So Swift doesn't always have the potential to go and try to connect to all of them, right? Because if we bet on ten this year and those ten disappear, then we are losing investment in that, and it's the same for the banks. So this is where TCIP comes into place. Right? So it's the perfect example of if you have this interoperability network and you have swift, that is using this interoperability network, we connect to 11,000 banks. You connect today to 15 chainings, to 15 blockchains, but you can connect to way more. That's the bet that we're putting on you guys, and we're trying to encourage you to do more.
00:05:00.938 - 00:05:19.700, Speaker B: Then you have these two infrastructures that are secure, that are reliable, that are scalable, that can actually work, so that you can buy an asset, whatever you want, and you can transact it in whatever country and serve institutions such as bank of New York Mellon or DTCC to actually do that cross border. Does that make.
00:05:20.630 - 00:05:54.960, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Thank you for that thoughtful explanation. I think that's right. I think people don't fully understand that Swift has the largest private key infrastructure in the whole banking industry. There is no reason to get rid of that private key infrastructure that already securely signs transactions to move around trillions of dollars in value. That's the existing integration that's extremely important around Swift. Together with its messaging and routing and all the standards that it creates, all of those standards can simply have an addition made to them that says blockchain stuff.
00:05:54.960 - 00:07:03.314, Speaker A: And then blockchain stuff needs to go somewhere. And instead of being very specific and going to hundreds of different chains and having all the complexity of going to hundreds of chains baked in, you can just have blockchain stuff go to a global standard like CCIP that can distribute that to hundreds of these chains efficiently. So just like we don't want to build private key infrastructure for the 11,000 banks of the world because that's already done, Swift doesn't necessarily want to build an integration with every single chain on the planet because that's a body of work that we're focused on. So in that sense, I think it's a great collaboration and partnership and it has been great working with them. Jonathan is right that it's been a long road together working through a lot of things that we haven't always been able to be super public about. But this proof of concept is something we're going to be talking about more and including more and more folks from the banking, capital markets and institutional side of financial markets to make a big collaboration around. So thank you Jonathan and Swift for working with us.
00:07:03.314 - 00:07:04.322, Speaker A: I really appreciate it.
00:07:04.376 - 00:07:04.980, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:07:12.810 - 00:07:35.040, Speaker A: I also missed a step when I introduced Jonathan that I didn't give him a chance to fully explain what Swift was. So I'm just going to correct that with Stephen and Victor. Steven, please tell us about the DTCC and the immensely important role it plays in the global financial system. And then if you could share your views on how cross chain and a multi chain world would evolve from your point of view.
00:07:35.410 - 00:07:57.250, Speaker D: Sure. Thanks and great to be here. So, Stephen, prosperity. I work at DTCC, which is a post trade market infrastructure provider. Our core business is providing clearance and settlement services for us securities markets and posts some pretty big numbers. I think last year we processed $2.4 quadrillion worth of securities.
00:07:57.250 - 00:08:43.970, Speaker D: We often get asked if that's a real number, and it is in fact a real number. And it represents basically all broker to broker trades of equities, corporate debt, treasuries in the US markets. So naturally we're very focused on blockchain and the opportunities it can present in the kind of industry where we sit in the industry and kind of getting back to the question, cross chain interoperability, we think it's very important. From day one of our exploration in this space, about six or so years now, we've kind of felt it important that there won't be one blockchain to rule them all. There will be multiple out there. The currencies will live across different chains, and other assets of value represented through tokens will live across different chains. So very similar to the role that we play in traditional markets of bringing all of those together.
00:08:43.970 - 00:09:24.910, Speaker D: And similar to swift in some ways, in that nature, being connected to all the banks and broker dealers to provide services, whether it's clearing services, settlement services, a lot of those same aspects, they'll transform, they'll look a little bit different, but fundamentally are very similar, I think, in a digital asset world. So in most of the initiatives that we take on, we look at how can this plug into multiple blockchains, and how can things coming down the pike like CCIP be used to help us kind of maintain that view? And again, to not build something that's already built, and to not have to stand up infrastructure to support 100 blockchains. If we can support one piece that can then plug into those 100 blockchains today, maybe 200 blockchains tomorrow.
00:09:25.730 - 00:09:26.286, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:09:26.388 - 00:10:03.478, Speaker A: Great. Makes sense. I think that's just a common sentiment that I'm seeing, is that the complexity of integrating with chains and the rapid rate at which they're changing, they're releasing new versions. One chain disappears, another chain reappears. I mean, it's really not a problem that I think larger institutions need to solve. I think it's a problem that crypto focused infrastructure like Chainlink should be focused on solving. And it's a problem that we're eagerly taking on and making sure that we have good solutions so that the capital markets can interact with blockchains efficiently, and more and more value can get on blockchains and become cryptographically guaranteed and highly reliable.
00:10:03.478 - 00:10:27.282, Speaker A: So I think that's the goal that we all have, whether we work in the capital markets or in the public blockchain world. I think at the end of the day, we just want a more reliable, more secure global financial system. So, Victor, I would really love to hear your views and excited to hear about bank of New York Mellon as well and your views on cross chain and what a multi chain world looks like from your point of view.
00:10:27.336 - 00:10:53.420, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really great to be here. A lot of energy in the room. So thanks for the invite. It's good to contribute. So, BNY Mellon, bank of New York Mellon is founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton. So it was the first treasurer of the United States. So anyone's seen Hamilton Broadway, they're talking about the founder of our company, first stock traded on the stock exchange, first loan to the US government.
00:10:53.420 - 00:11:38.950, Speaker C: So a lot of history, and that's very much embedded in our culture and our company. And we continue to stay relevant because we innovate and want to continue to stay engaged and grow, right? And innovate. We service 20% of the world's investable assets. So that's twice the US GDP in terms of custody. We clear and settle 10 trillion a day in us government securities or treasury securities, 2 trillion in payments. And we have wealth management and a strong distribution franchise in Pershing, which is essentially servicing broker dealers and registered investment advisors. Now, where I sit, I'm the head of the enterprise tokenization in the bank.
00:11:38.950 - 00:12:55.330, Speaker C: And so I have a view of what's going on across all different lines of business. And I see sort of this interoperability play happening, not only connecting banks and others to each other, because essentially, I think what historically financial institutions haven't done well is connect, right? And so what's happened is we all have sort of our own islands and we try to operate the best way that we can, but there's always some sort of fear or nervousness around what happens if I connect more broadly into the market. What happens to my market share, what happens to my business? It's a complicated question. And we see sort of blockchains and Chainlink and others not only connecting infrastructure to each other, market infrastructure like banks like DTCC or SWiFt, but even within banks, right? Because you have multiple systems, you have essentially multiple lines of business, and they've kind of grown up independent of each other. And so there's a lot of integration that needs to happen within banks. And so BNY Mallon is very much focused on building a centralized digital asset platform, connecting our individual lines of business and the different quote unquote, rails we have, but also interested in connecting more broadly to the likes of DTCC, Swift, and perhaps one day chainlink.
00:12:57.050 - 00:13:36.654, Speaker A: Great, thank you. I think you folks have a real level of insight about how tokenization is being approached in capital markets, because you're on the forefront of dealing with people that want to do that at some level of scale rather than at the pilot or proof of concept size. So I think it'd be interesting to hear how each of you is seeing tokenization as a dynamic take hold in the capital markets. What are you seeing with people adopting tokenization. What are you seeing with tokenization becoming the way that capital markets want to interact? Jonathan, I'll let you start. What are your views on tokenization in the capital markets?
00:13:36.702 - 00:14:05.530, Speaker B: Well, it's definitely here. It's not going to go away. I mean, we have adapted all of our messaging standards so that we can make sure that we can cater for the information that is needed for tokenized assets. It's different granularity on the fractionalization of these assets. There's different ways to identify these assets, the fact that they are not holding safekeeping accounts, but they are holding wallets. So there's a whole implementation that needs to be done in financial messaging standards for this to happen. And this is something that is already live.
00:14:05.530 - 00:14:43.814, Speaker B: So that already means that if a full network is actually changing the languages to make sure that we can cater for these assets, it's not going to go away. We don't invest a dime unless we know it's something that is long term. So they're not going to go away. And I think for the capital markets industry, it's not necessarily crypto where we see the big takeup or now, or in the long term, it's more on the digital security. So tokenization of equity or bonds or therefore anything that is actually linked to the cash leg of that, which could be CBDC, stable coins or anything on that realm, but not necessarily crypto for now, makes sense.
00:14:43.932 - 00:14:45.830, Speaker A: Steven, what are your views?
00:14:46.250 - 00:15:46.934, Speaker D: Yeah, agree with a lot of what Jonathan just said. I'll kind of lay it out like this going back a couple of years, around 2018 at DTCC, we were looking at the concept of public blockchain and kind of on the back of the ICO boom. At the time, a lot of the large financial institutions were maybe not fully recognizing public blockchains, were opting to go private. I think that narrative changed a little bit, but we decided to lean into it and we put together something we called Project Whitney and looked at, what does it mean, tokenize the security from our perspective of market infrastructure provider? We learned a whole lot from doing that. And we engage with kind of all walks of industry participants, custodians, broker dealers, exchanges, and all of that informed efforts that we're doing right now under the name of DSM digital securities management, which is focused on private market securities. And that kind of is the way we're thinking about tokenization right now. Not specific to just private markets, but I'll say greenfield areas, areas that don't have infrastructure coverage today for a couple of reasons.
00:15:46.934 - 00:16:55.514, Speaker D: That's not to say that public markets infrastructure is perfect across the board, but fundamentally, there is infrastructure there. There is ways to transact with it. There is this whole kind of wide range of assets, whether it's forms of real estate, tangible things like art, as well as pre IPO equity, that are sort of ripe for some efficient infrastructure. And if we are kind of at this crossroads where we can try to go bolt it onto the existing infrastructure or leverage this new technology and some of the capabilities that can come with it, we're going to opt to go the new route there. So that's where we see a lot of the attention right now in capital markets is focusing on those areas that are ripe for infrastructure. And then I'd say solutions that make them more tokens, more usable by large financial institutions. So that means not just the concept of self custody in a wallet, but how do you bake them into our existing kind of tax and legal frameworks? There are pension funds out there and things like that, that have requirements to use a qualified custodian, and they already have, to Jonathan's point earlier, existing relationships there, and it's hard for them to break off and go to a new provider.
00:16:55.514 - 00:17:10.994, Speaker D: So we look at it as how can the solutions that we build and the solutions that we're interested in kind of working with take all of the best parts of this new technology and kind of bridge over to pieces of the existing world right now to really realize the maximum benefit?
00:17:11.042 - 00:17:27.738, Speaker A: I'd say, wow, that's really interesting. So it's really those infrastructure underdeveloped in terms of infrastructure sectors where you don't have the better infrastructure already existing for transacting digitally, that you see some of this taking hold.
00:17:27.904 - 00:18:04.040, Speaker D: Yeah, I think kind of all markets will have a target on them at some point, but there are a lot of, to be honest, barriers in place. So kind of the area is, what are those new assets? And then we can start the conversation. And I know we talked about this just before we came up here, but just looking at the fact that there's about a trillion dollars worth of assets on the kind of digital asset crypto side of the world and $100 trillion worth of securities in the existing. And we have to start working on that path of how do those become digital. Right? Because we can't just kind of only work on one path. There needs to be that bridge there between traditional and.
00:18:05.050 - 00:18:14.394, Speaker A: Yep, sounds right. Thank you. Victor would be thrilled to hear your views. Considering you're head of tokenization, I'm sure you have some very, astute views, please share them with us.
00:18:14.512 - 00:19:00.330, Speaker C: Yeah, by default, I'm definitely bullish on tokenization, enough so that the bank thought it was important to have someone just in charge of this in BNY Mellon to help ensure that we do it correctly. It is table stakes, I think, over time, for us and for anyone who's involved in the capital markets, we're not taking sort of a greenfield approach to tokenization like DTCC, though. I think that's an admirable thing to do. Focus on a new asset class, see if you can create that infrastructure. And I think given DTCC's role, that's a real sweet spot for them. We're actually looking at tokenizing all different types of assets. And really, tokenization for me, is an enabler for interoperability.
00:19:00.330 - 00:19:02.822, Speaker C: It's really about standardizing.
00:19:02.886 - 00:19:03.162, Speaker B: Right?
00:19:03.216 - 00:19:41.122, Speaker C: And so just as we were talking about the 1 trillion and the 100 trillion that needs to converge and operate in the same environment. And if you can't do that, then clients of ours, we have broker dealers, investment managers, the largest financial institutions in the world. They don't want to segregate and manage their assets in different pools. They want to have one client experience. They want to be able to utilize those assets efficiently, hopefully in very similar ways. And where it is dissimilar. They want all of that to be solved for in the background.
00:19:41.186 - 00:19:41.462, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:41.516 - 00:20:12.366, Speaker C: Just like Chainlink is going to be solving the interoperability issues. So for us, I see it as a way for us to connect BNY Mellon to other market infrastructure, to be able to mobilize assets across different settlement systems globally in a seamless manner. And why is that important? Well, banks, other asset owners, et cetera, they put a lot of capital, a lot of assets in accounts just to facilitate the movement of things in the world.
00:20:12.468 - 00:20:12.782, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:12.836 - 00:20:48.780, Speaker C: And so it's sort of the grease against the wheel to be able to move things. You have to sort of what they call overfund, you have to put a treasury in to take a treasury out. Now, they do that all over the place, and there's billions of capital allocated just to support mobility of assets, for example. But if you're able to do it atomically and you're able to do it in an interoperable way, you can swap assets. And you don't have to have that same capital buffer, they call it, to be able to facilitate movement. So what do we use tokenization for in the bank? Well, we're tokenizing treasuries internally. Experimenting with that.
00:20:48.780 - 00:21:25.030, Speaker C: We think that there's an opportunity for us to connect more broadly and mobilize those assets to places where they need them. Generally, volatility in the market creates uncertainty, which in the case of collateral, you need to move collateral to different locations, just like you've had a margin call for a crypto trade, for example, and it's gone the way you didn't want it to go. You have to place more collateral. Same things happen all in capital markets. The other thing around tokenization is that it really helps with 24 x seven. It's like the infrastructure that can always stay up.
00:21:25.180 - 00:21:25.542, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:25.596 - 00:21:56.240, Speaker C: And the crypto markets have really pushed the financial markets to think about that. And we need to be able to support our clients at any time zone, in any location. And so by tokenizing an asset, there's things that you can do to that asset. From a settlement and clearance perspective, that helps create efficiency, like settling it instantaneously, t zero. Instead of like Europe, which is t plus two, you can accelerate transactions. And so we think that's also a big opportunity.
00:21:57.910 - 00:22:22.150, Speaker A: Great. Yeah, makes sense. I think the always on dynamic is kind of here to stay at this point. And folks are going to be expecting that more and more for the sake of time. I think we have time for maybe one last category of questions around Defi. And it's really around how do you view Defi, and do you foresee a regulated form of DeFi emerging? Jonathan, what are your thoughts?
00:22:22.810 - 00:22:59.526, Speaker B: So you need defi if you want to grasp the full benefits of tokenization and everything that we have spoken about. Right. The same way you need web3 to actually have that verifiable truth that you were mentioning in your introduction this morning. Right. Which is something that we also believe. Cryptography has been there forever, and Swift is at the center of that now. I wonder, and maybe we can see the reaction of the audience today, because you guys know better than we do, but is regulated DeFi, really? Defi? That's something I wonder every day you see, you see the reaction already.
00:22:59.526 - 00:23:32.190, Speaker B: Usually you get booze for opinions, but anyways, so it's something that we have to, as part of being the incumbents in DeFi infrastructures like Swift, banks, et cetera, we have to be humble to understand that DeFi is a space where in some cases, we're not going to be welcome. So if we're not welcome, then is it DeFi, too? But I do believe that if financial services want to go into DeFi mode, there needs to be some sort of regulated defi. Whether we call it DeFi, that's another question.
00:23:32.260 - 00:23:49.382, Speaker A: Makes sense. I just want to say, I welcome all of you to Defi. All of you and all of the massive amount of value that you just said. I welcome all that shit to Defi, too. You're very welcome. We're very happy to have you here. I hope you and Defi can become.
00:23:49.436 - 00:23:52.886, Speaker B: Like this, especially Steven's quadrillion. Right?
00:23:53.068 - 00:24:10.410, Speaker A: Everybody, everybody, we are very happy to welcome. You're very welcome. Let me just make that clear from the DeFi side of things. So, Stephen, what are your views on DeFi and the possibility of regulated DeFi and Defi's interaction with larger financial systems?
00:24:10.830 - 00:24:44.070, Speaker D: Yeah, I struggle to use the word regulated Defi. I guess if you ask the regulators, they would say, well, we already do regulated, or at least you're already bound by regulations. But I think the kind of important, the area that we need to push towards is something that gets financial institutions comfortable with using DeFi. That's a way less sexy name and doesn't roll off the tongue as well. But ultimately, that's what they need to get involved. And we've heard kind of permission DeFi, which also has. But at the end of the day, we need institutions to feel like they're not going to get busted on KyC AML, that they know who they're transacting with.
00:24:44.070 - 00:25:32.470, Speaker D: And I think ultimately, that's very important to the DeFi ecosystem. The more liquidity, more kind of everything that makes a healthy, functioning market. I think Defi markets are different in terms of how you interact, but they are fundamentally markets. And back in the days when we were trading pieces of paper to electronic, to digital assets, kind of the core characteristics of the market remain intact. And I think in order to really achieve what's possible there, the institutions will need to find a way to get involved. So things like decentralized identity can be a big tool to help get to that point. And I think kind of some trust verifiers there may start to look like either regulatory bodies or kind of financial utilities, but I think that's what will open up the space and get them comfortable and kind of looking forward to that step and happy to accept your invitation into DeFi at that point.
00:25:32.620 - 00:25:44.746, Speaker A: Sounds good. So, kind of compliant DeFi, that's what you're seeing people interested in, is the power of DeFi, but in a compliant way, makes perfect sense. Victor, what are your views on?
00:25:44.768 - 00:26:16.726, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll echo some of what was mean ultimately. You know, KYC and AML is extremely important to banks. Right. And we got to make sure where the money is coming from, especially if it's financing something that we're doing internally for BNY Mellon, for example, given our role in treasury market, we're highly, highly regulated. But ultimately, I see a huge value proposition of DeFi. I think if you can forecast an ample amount of liquidity in some of these protocols, it's a diversified pool of funding. Right.
00:26:16.726 - 00:27:22.442, Speaker C: And sometimes when you think about counterparty diversification, that's a super beneficial aspect of liquidity and capital, as opposed to being one on one relationship with a particular counterparty. You hit credit limits and you have to manage risk associated with that individual entity. But if you're looking at a group of entities or multiple providers of cash or securities, there may be some risk management benefits to that, in my opinion. And where I think DeFi could benefit is really around intraday liquidity, where liquidity is needed to sort of grease the wheels in an existing financial institution or for example, if you're lending or borrowing assets or cash. I think some of the more vanilla types of transactions that take place between counterparties and financial institutions would be a great first step. And then as things get more esoteric and more complex, that's probably get solved at a later stage just because of the complexity of the smart contracts and such. But I do think once regulators are comfortable, absolutely, banks will be there.
00:27:22.442 - 00:27:30.650, Speaker C: Will have to be there, and there will be a portion of their activity with their counterparties that I think will slowly shift over into these DeFi protocols.
00:27:32.030 - 00:28:19.270, Speaker A: Makes sense. I appreciate the thoughtful view. I think I'm of the same view that once everyone's comfortable, there's so much value in DeFi that it's going to be a little bit inescapable. Just like tokenization is now inescapable as a dynamic, because your users, your clients, they're asking about it, right? And that's really what drives your relationship with markets, is what your users and clients ask for. So I'm thrilled we've had this amazing and insightful conversation. Jonathan, Steve, and Victor really want to thank you for coming to the conference and sharing your well informed views with us. I think we've learned a lot and really looking forward to finding ways to collaborate and finding ways for all of you to become part of DeFi.
