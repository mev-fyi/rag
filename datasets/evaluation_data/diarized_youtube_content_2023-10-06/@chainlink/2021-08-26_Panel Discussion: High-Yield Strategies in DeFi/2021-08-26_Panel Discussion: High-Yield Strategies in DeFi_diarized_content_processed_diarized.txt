00:00:05.290 - 00:00:26.390, Speaker A: Hi everyone, welcome to the panel. My name is Zaji Reyes. I'm a part of the ecosystem team here at Chainlink Labs and super excited to dive into some high yield strategies in Defi. I'll go ahead and have each of our panelists please introduce themselves. Feel free to talk a little bit about your project, your background, and how you're integrated with Chainlink. Let's go ahead and start with Jaron.
00:00:27.530 - 00:01:28.070, Speaker B: Yeah, hi, I'm founder and lead developer of Bpotocol B Protocol is a backstop solution for lending platforms, which enables them to offer better leverage ratios and capital efficiencies and basically aggregates user liquidity for liquidations and from their side allow them also to get some yield on being the desktop. Previously was CTO of Kyber Network and what we do with chaining, it's actually twofold. So we have a pricing algorithm that somewhat relies and reads the chain link price feed. And in addition, we also now use in a beta mode the chain link keeper system, which actually makes sure that our pricing algorithm does not deviate too much from Dex prices. And if it does, it simply invokes arbitrage transaction.
00:01:30.780 - 00:01:33.240, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you Monir.
00:01:35.100 - 00:02:23.450, Speaker C: Hi everyone, I'm monier from the repara swap. It's a liquidity aggregator on theorem blockchain, its side chains, and very soon on L2 solutions, we allow traders Dapps protocols to access decentralized liquidity and basically make best possible trades on those chains. We use chain link it's been a while right now for the price feed side as a protection mechanism for the end users to spot if there's any kind of disconnect between prices, and also for our algorithm to be able to take gas prices and market prices into consideration to minimize the fees and to maximize the prices. And very soon we'll be integrating keepers for limit orders that will be also using BioSoP, which I think is very cool.
00:02:24.940 - 00:02:28.570, Speaker A: Some big news there. Thank you. And mo, go ahead.
00:02:29.500 - 00:03:35.970, Speaker D: Hi, this is mo from setter. So setter is a L2 scaling platform. Our aim is to bring fast, secure and very low cost applications to blockchain using L2 scaling technologies like state channel, Roab and other ways. So we launched the world first generated state channel networks and continue to push on the frontier of L2 scaling with advanced roll up technology. Recently we launched L2 finance, which is a L2 scaling solution to help existing d five protocol to scale on L2 without moving the protocol but moving the user and reduce the cost for the user significantly. And we also launched the Seabridge that allows user to bridge their liquidity across multi chains very easily. So we use Chainlink to use the price feed as a general condition for some of the generalized conditional transferred in state channel, so that we can kind of rely on price feed in terms of what is the result of some off chain or L2 conditional transfer.
00:03:35.970 - 00:03:47.830, Speaker D: And we also use Chainlink's randomness, Oracle in certain cases for the layer of finance as well. So yeah, this is us.
00:03:49.080 - 00:03:56.900, Speaker A: Great to have you. Thank you. Lena, let's hear a little bit about McDex. Oh, you might want to unmute.
00:03:58.620 - 00:05:08.776, Speaker E: Sorry. Hi everyone, my name is Lena, I'm the bd director for the McDeX. So McDex is the first fully permissionless decks for trading the perpetual contract. And that is a capital efficiency efficient with the top market liquidity, and we provide up to 20 times leverage. And our fully decentralized trading platform is powered by the AMM and allows anyone can create any kind of contract and also can trade on our platform permissionless, which dramatically increase the market diversity. And working with Trilink, as everybody knows, Oracle is a very critical infrastructure for any decentralized perpetual platform. So the price fees play a very important role to determine the profit and the loss of the traders, especially during the liquidation process when the market is volatile, that's when the oracle may not work as expected.
00:05:08.776 - 00:05:34.790, Speaker E: However, working with training in the past, we found that chaining provide very good service, provide us very accurate and stable data. And the other aspect we also appreciate training provide is their decentralization and their price deviation and also their availabilities for the price feed. Thank you.
00:05:36.520 - 00:05:40.330, Speaker A: Thank you for being here. Okay, Brian, let's hear it.
00:05:41.260 - 00:06:22.276, Speaker F: Hi, I'm Brian Kerr, the CEO and co founder of Kava. Kava is a cross chain defi platform. It's a layer one blockchain that provides a number of different pieces of infrastructure to support Defi apps. On top of it, we use Chainlink Oracles. We actually built a custom implementation of Chainlink oracles so prices could be posted directly on the Kava blockchain. And once it's there, it can be used by a number of our apps, including Kava's claralized loans, which can be used for BTC and BNB, where users can receive a stablecoin in return. It can be used in the money markets, where people can supply assets and borrow them.
00:06:22.276 - 00:06:31.770, Speaker F: And it's kind of backing all the liquidations and auctions that we use on Kava for those apps and all apps in the future.
00:06:33.980 - 00:06:51.500, Speaker A: Great, thank you everyone for introducing yourselves I'd love to dive into what each project is working on a little more deeply. So we'll go ahead and start with Mo if you don't mind sharing a little bit more about how seller is using L2 solutions to really push mainstream adoption for blockchain. That'd be great to dive into that a little deeper.
00:06:52.640 - 00:07:31.832, Speaker D: Definitely sounds good. So seller, we see ourselves as a middleware layer for L2 scaling. And for us, we really work on two aspect things. One is to reduce the cost of user interacting with layer one and all the other chains. And the other is to provide interoperability solutions. So for reducing the cost side, we have like two sector ones on the gaming, the other is on the defi space for the gaming. We launched something called Sellerx, using our state channel technology to enable users to have a very high interactive gaming applications and payment processing capability.
00:07:31.832 - 00:08:22.840, Speaker D: And based on that, there is a platform called Seller X, which is a gaming platform for esport matching and tournament matches. And that game has achieved about 1 million users right now in the US. And then there is also the aspect of L2 finance, which is most recently launched. The one way to look at this is what we call a public transportation system for DeFI applications. That is, we're not moving DFI applications to L2, but aggregating all the users there. And when the users say, okay, I want to go to compound, I want to go somewhere else, all the users requests are aggregated on L2 into a single request on layer one. Therefore, they split the cost of kind of one single transaction instead of individually making every each and individual transactions.
00:08:22.840 - 00:09:20.190, Speaker D: So that significantly saves users cost on that front. And we also have Seabridge, which is really focusing on the multichain interoperability future to seamlessly bridge right now assets across different chains with extremely low delay and low cost, especially for layer to layer, L2 to L2, or side chain to L2 bridging right now, isn't there a lot of really good solutions? And it takes some time to kind of do that. Bridge and Seabridge really provides the capability to do that with low cost and low latency. And anyone can join Sebridge by running a node and provide the liquidity to the network. Within one week of launch, we have processed more than close to $4 million transactions right now across all the chains that actually chain links support them. So that's just kind of a quick intro about us.
00:09:21.360 - 00:09:42.976, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's great. As a user myself, it's always interesting to hear how you can have lower cost effective and efficient transactions so thank you for chatting about that, Yaron. It would be great to hear. Backstop programs like b protocol are quite common in CFI and traditional finance. How do you take something that works well in web two and have it run in a decentralized manner in DFI?
00:09:43.168 - 00:11:03.752, Speaker B: Yeah, actually previous to before the call, we were doing some backstopping on CFI and then starting to work on DFI and doing liquidation bots over there. It became very apparent how inefficient DeFI liquidations are. So actually initially we did try to mimic the CFI backstop structure and we identified that the real issue, and it's very hard to onboard professional traders because of all the MEV, the miners extractable value. And this is why traders are very reluctant to participate in DeFi liquidations. So initially we tried to onboard that we had this very complex setting which actually ruled out the MEV, but then realized that the real promise of DeFi is actually put the power in the hands of the people, the end users, the retail users. So actually pivoted into more a retail user based. Basically we allow users to pull their liquidity together and use it for liquidations, where the main novelty here is in our rebalancing solution.
00:11:03.752 - 00:11:33.290, Speaker B: So the real art in a sense in desktop is, okay, you got some liquidity with a discount, how you get rid of it, how you sell it back into the market. So we developed a new algorithm partly based on chaining price feed. And actually with that we expected it to be much easier because DeFi has a lot of user liquidity which is available. So it will give rise actually to a much stronger backstop than the CFI one.
00:11:35.260 - 00:11:52.300, Speaker A: Got it. Thank you. Yeah. And I think just the highlight of putting the power back to the people is really important. And that's exactly why b protocol is doing so well. So thank you. And monir, on the topic of liquidity, what is it that paraswap is doing that differentiates them from other liquidity aggregators and Dex aggregators?
00:11:53.040 - 00:12:43.480, Speaker C: So if you see there are three big actors right now, and we are part of the three, each is taking a specific road. One of them is taking the full retail part, which is cool. What we try to do is build an infrastructure that's going to be decentralized in the future and what's going to become a decentralized middleware that is not owned by a single team. That's not obviously going to happen tomorrow. But what we're building right now is an API first product that is made for others to integrate. And we are the first user or the first power user of this through our UI that already processed around $9 billion in volume, especially the last, although nine h was done only the last five months. And that's big part of it was made through the API and our UI.
00:12:43.480 - 00:13:06.820, Speaker C: So that what differentiated us more than others is this middleware approach and this API and infrastructure approach that others are not certainly taking. Because we think that the use cases for retail are very diverse and we're better to focus only on the infrastructure side and let other folks like RZ metamask ledger to focus more on the retail in their perspective.
00:13:07.960 - 00:13:24.350, Speaker A: Okay, so focusing on middleware. We'll take that one. Thank you, Manir and Brian, I've been following the Kawa ecosystem for a while, but it's definitely expanded a lot since its inception. Would you be able to talk about more about some of the dapps and products being built on top of it?
00:13:25.040 - 00:14:02.260, Speaker F: Yeah, sure. So Kava started as a single application blockchain, focused on providing loans to assets like BNB, BTC, XRP that's in production for over a year now. And I think it might be the longest standing crosschain Defi platform that's out. Still no hacks and exploits. Fingers crossed. It's always good to put safety of users first, but from there, we built a lot of the bits and pieces, the cross chain bridges, to move assets. As we mentioned, Chainlink's integration on Takava, providing very secure and reliable price feeds.
00:14:02.260 - 00:14:37.084, Speaker F: And then we also have different modules which perform functions like liquidation engines, auctions and other things. So we've been from that point, very quickly been able to launch new applications. The second application that we launched in November of 2020 is called the hard protocol. It provides a money market service to all the assets that are transported to the Kava blockchain. And we're actually in progress of launching our third application, which should be out by the end of August. And that'll be a cross chain amm, so autonomous market making platform. So that'll be very exciting.
00:14:37.084 - 00:15:07.820, Speaker F: It'll really enhance liquidity and what people can do. The assets, once it's there. And then from there, in our roadmap, we actually have other applications. They're both being built by the Kava labs team as well as external teams. And those include kind of like a curve analog. Third party team is working on that. And then also robo advisors, which will allow people to kind of look across the whole ecosystem of applications that live on kava and deploy capital efficiently to get the best yields.
00:15:09.120 - 00:15:25.232, Speaker A: Well, yeah. So there's a lot on the roadmap that we have to look forward to, so definitely keep us updated on that. And Lena, I'd love to hear a little bit more about the governance structure and how it works and how does liquidity mining operate within McDex. Please jump into that.
00:15:25.366 - 00:15:57.180, Speaker E: Sure. So our governance is fully operated by McDex DaO. So first, the DaO vote will capture the values from the McDex trading platform. The value is mainly from the transaction fee. So for example, we are going to launch over version three on main net very soon. So the Dow will operate several contracts on the platform and then the transaction fee right now is set of 0.7%. Yeah.
00:15:57.180 - 00:17:09.424, Speaker E: By the way, since I mentioned that we are going to launch our version three really soon, we're going to launch on the Arbitron as a flagship project on Arbitron. We expect to launch on the same date as the Arbitron launched their main net. So this is very exciting. Okay, let's go back to our daO. So since we captured the values in our Dao vault and all the MC holders, they can governance the DAO to decide how we want to use this funds tube. So based on our current tokenomics, so the new issued MCB is confined by the trading volume on the platform. And the MCB holders can also decide if they want to issue more MCB or they want to say, okay, we want the new issued MCB to be distributed on liquid mining or transaction mining, or even they can vote it to see if we want to invest on other projects inside our ecosystem.
00:17:09.424 - 00:18:14.104, Speaker E: So there are a lot of cases we can provide for the MCB holders to decide how we want distribute their tokens and for the liquid mining. So this is how it works in our program. First, the liquid provider will deposit one single asset, and secondly, there is no impermanent loss for the LP provider. But the LP provider does take some market maker loss. And secondly, the LP provider, they also can share the certain percentage from the transaction fee. And also we have a special program when we launch over version three, there is some extra MCB reward for those liquid providers. We are going to announce that soon.
00:18:14.104 - 00:18:43.520, Speaker E: And also based on all this liquid mining, the testing from the past month in our testnet, we can see the LP APY is relative competitive, even though without any MCB rewards. So everyone can anticipate that this is a really good program for their liquid mining.
00:18:45.220 - 00:18:50.390, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for explaining that. And also congrats on the arbitrum news. That's really huge.
00:18:51.240 - 00:18:51.604, Speaker E: Cool.
00:18:51.642 - 00:19:10.890, Speaker A: So we'll go ahead and dive into some questions for everyone. First, I'd love to ask. DeFi has been growing tremendously this past year, and we're seeing a lot of institutional funds coming into the space. Does anyone have an opinion on if that's a good thing, or is it just diluting high yield pools? Does anybody think there's something specific there they'd like to share?
00:19:12.300 - 00:19:45.990, Speaker F: I would say the point of DeFi is to aggregate capital so that DeFi applications can actually be more efficient. There's capital efficiencies to be had. So I think institutional capital coming in equals more capital into these DeFi applications. And while that might result in a little lower yields for the average user in different cases and circumstances, I think as a whole, and to improve the robustness of all these applications, it's actually making them more capital efficient, and therefore being able to provide a better service to everyone through that.
00:19:48.680 - 00:19:52.520, Speaker A: Thank you. Does anybody else have any opinions? Maybe Monir?
00:19:54.220 - 00:20:43.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's definitely a great thing, because, yes, as Brian said, it's more capital, so it will be very beneficial, and it's bringing more efficiency into DeFi, and also maybe creating new use cases for DeFi. As we can see, some DeFi protocols started to create institutional versions or variations of it, like AaVE with AavE Pro and others, which brings DeFi not only being a high yield would say Ponzi stuff, as some people can perceive it, but also as a technology that can play the role of the backend for the future of finance. So I think finance or institutional finance coming is a validation that this technology is superior to what exists already. That I think is obsolete.
00:20:45.500 - 00:21:28.630, Speaker D: Yeah, and just adding on top of that, I think institutional entering and participation is definitely good. But from a technology point of view, like what we are working on here is to make sure that when the institution money start to flow in and in big chunks, they're now showing a very significant advantage comparing to just normal users. So we can still keep the entire ecosystem relatively flat and accessible for everyone in the ecosystem. And kind of having everyone on a level playground with all the institutions will be crucial for the esos, and also kind of the culture of the blockchain, basically.
00:21:31.020 - 00:21:44.780, Speaker A: That's definitely a great opinion. Thank you. And Yaron, do you think that building DeFi projects and protocols in a digitally native DeFi way is the best way to go about it? Or should we be decentralizing these tools?
00:21:47.040 - 00:22:31.710, Speaker B: No, the poetry tech is actually making things more decentralized, more in the backbone rather than user facing protocols, however, it's all kind of coupled together, like protocols level, are very user facing, et cetera. So at least our approach is to get things more decentralized, more distributed. But yeah, I think moving forward, I imagine a lot of value will be captured at the application level, which could potentially be more centralized, which will offer also better user experience, et cetera. So there are room for both, but at least the backbone should be decentralized as possible.
00:22:32.800 - 00:22:41.384, Speaker A: Yeah. And Lena, do you feel the same way? How does McDex approach building institutional? Oh, you're on mute.
00:22:41.432 - 00:23:38.796, Speaker E: Sorry again. Yes, definitely. So for the McDex, we think it's definitely a good thing so that we can build some decentralized tools for the whole DeFi world. Because we truly believe that in the DeFi, decentralized is the key, and it's very important to boost the whole ecosystem to grow and also will encourage, everybody will participate in a very fearless and security fashion to do any kinds of the trading or any other projects to help each other. So we definitely work on that very hard. And then we also think to building over around McDeX, the protocol. We would like to build the whole ecosystem.
00:23:38.796 - 00:23:44.930, Speaker E: We want to help other projects can grow as the way the DeFi should.
00:23:46.280 - 00:24:00.410, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. And anybody can answer this, but curious, how are you incentivizing your users to get involved, and especially newcomers to DeFi? How are you making things a little easier for them?
00:24:04.350 - 00:25:29.586, Speaker D: Well, I can go first. Well, for us, the key thing here is to reduce the cost for the newcomers, right? So, like, if this is some newcomer coming into the DeFi space and entering the space through Ethereum, the first thing they will see is, okay, I'm going to try with $1,000. But like a couple thousand dollars combined with close to $100 transaction fees on the main net, means that before they do anything in DeFi, they're actually in the loss. Basically, like even one year yield on a couple of $1,000 combined with $100 of a transaction fee will make no one wants to kind of enter the d five space, because that's just not feasible. So what we're doing on this space is to allow the users to kind of reduce cost of interaction by just depositing once into the L2 finance ecosystem, and allow them to kind of play with different DeFi strategies and protocols without, first of all, the complexity of understanding each and every details of the DeFi strategy, and also significantly lower cost by splitting all the cost with all the other retail users. So really we are trying to kind of help everyone kind of achieve a very level playground with all the whales, even in ethereum, layer one and so is capable of kind of doing the same thing for all the L2 and the side chain, different chains as well. And Seabraid is along a similar kind of spirit.
00:25:29.586 - 00:26:11.970, Speaker D: They're here to allow users in these different L2 ecosystem who are onboarded in a certain L2 ecosystem first to still be able to move their asset at freelay across different kind of chain ecosystems without kind of suffering from the mandatory bridging stamp between L2 to layer one and then back to L2 again, which kind of basically consumes their cost. So a lot of our users were seeing our bridging transactions in the order of hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars, which would not be possible if they just directly using the L2, sorry, layer one, native bridge. So this is like what we are kind of trying to do to help users to enter this space easier.
00:26:12.710 - 00:26:13.460, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:26:15.830 - 00:26:16.846, Speaker A: Go ahead, Dina.
00:26:16.958 - 00:27:30.698, Speaker E: Yeah, sorry. So for us, we actually thinking the good uiux is really a good way to introduce some new user to the DeFi world, because something we want to build, our version three is a very smooth, easy to use platform, so any user can adapt it really quick. And secondly, as I just mentioned earlier, the transaction fee can be high sometimes. So that's why we have a special program we call the transaction mining, that is provided all the traders 100% rebate for their transaction fee. So I think it's really good for them to just participate into this perpetual contract trading work. And the third way we help other normal users is as us, we can use as a hedge tools for them. So for example, the liquid provider, they may take some market making loss, but there is a way they can short on over perpetual contract so that they can hatch the risk from that side.
00:27:30.698 - 00:27:47.294, Speaker E: So I think there are a couple of ways can encourage users to participate and think the defi is an innovative and great tools on the top of the traditional finance tools. Thank you.
00:27:47.492 - 00:28:05.160, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. And I know we only have a couple of minutes left, so just to close things out, I would love to hear everyone just really quickly share what type of high yield instruments each of your companies is looking to improve upon as we close out 2021. And Brian, I know you were going to chat on the last question, so maybe I'll start with you.
00:28:06.970 - 00:28:11.062, Speaker F: Yeah, if I don't mind, I would just like to touch on the last question.
00:28:11.116 - 00:28:11.878, Speaker A: Yeah, please.
00:28:12.044 - 00:28:56.790, Speaker F: Something that we do at Kava here is we actually take a two pronged approach for users. There's the technical users, which we're building out what I would call like a decentralized Coinbase approach, where anybody can land on the website or interact directly with the blockchain and they get all the bits and tools that you would find on Coinbase. So that's being able to trade well, at the launch of Kavaswap, they'll be able to trade between all the major assets. With all of this is on decentralizing the kava blockchain with low transaction fees and the like. But then also they'll have access to high yield instruments via the hard money market. Some of those, by the way, are like with USDX stablecoins that has an effective aPY of about 100% currently. So get them while they're hot.
00:28:56.790 - 00:29:32.580, Speaker F: They sound too good to be true, and it's very good. And I'm a participant, lots of other people are participants. I think it'll be the case, as Defi is growing, that yields are just going to be far greater than what you can get in cash accounts elsewhere. So by all means, you take advantage of it. In a year or two, I think all those yields will be gone. But in our platform, there's just a number of different high yield instruments. But particularly for the hard money market, I think BTC and USDX and actually bUsD are all very high yield, I believe over 20%.
00:29:32.580 - 00:29:48.840, Speaker F: So I point people towards that. And then at the launch of kava swap, being an LP, into the pools that are available there, I think will be very high yields at the start and for particular pools over time as well.
00:29:49.850 - 00:29:53.026, Speaker A: Thank you. One word, Monir, what are you guys looking to improve upon?
00:29:53.058 - 00:30:12.170, Speaker C: One word for us, we don't have really any high yield, but we allow those who have high yield to have a swap API or swap Ui in order to convert their profits into another assets. And yeah, we like a utility tool for these guys who are yield farming and getting those funds.
00:30:12.330 - 00:30:19.790, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay, everyone, we are out of time, but it's been amazing listening to all of you. Thank you for being here and have a great time at the conference.
00:30:20.690 - 00:30:21.680, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:30:23.250 - 00:30:29.366, Speaker F: Thank you, Zaji, definitely appreciate it. And yeah, it's amazing to see the.
00:30:29.388 - 00:30:35.540, Speaker D: Difference between what DeFi is actually building and the yield that's happening versus what's in cash accounts around the world.
