00:00:00.090 - 00:01:02.026, Speaker A: To thank you, everybody, for joining us here for kind of our first ever video Fireside Q-A-I want to thank both Synthetics, Chainlink and the blockchain community for joining us today. In addition, I wanted to thank Justin Moses, the CTO of Synthetix, and Johanned, the product manager of Chainlink, for also being kind of our panelist here during this Q a session. The overall goal of this Q A is to allow the community to learn more about the integration between synthetics and Chainlink, exploring what makes integration unique and beneficial to both the teams and the users of each product. So, just to briefly go over the agenda, for the first 30 to 40 minutes, we're going to have kind of a fireside chat structure that will then be followed by about ten to 15 minutes of questions that we have gathered from both the synthetics and the chainlink community in the past few days. If for some reason you have a question that was not addressed, please feel free. Drop by the synthetics discord or various chain link channels after the chat, we will do our best to answer them. We will also add any links to the description of the YouTube once completed, so you can follow up with your research and explore further.
00:01:02.026 - 00:01:13.730, Speaker A: So without further ado, Justin, if you wouldn't mind kind of introducing yourself, maybe explaining a little bit about your background and then talking about what your team is building or has already built with synthetics.
00:01:15.030 - 00:01:15.442, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:01:15.496 - 00:02:05.380, Speaker C: Thanks, Rory, and thanks for Chainlink, the community, for setting this up. Appreciate it. So, yeah, I'm Justin, I'm the CTO of Synthetix, and I'm actually originally from Australia, and I happen to be in Australia right now, but I'm actually typically based in New York and I have been there for almost the past decade, actually, my background has been in traditional web engineering, full stack engineering. I actually came the founder of Synthetics, and I've been friends since high school, and we actually had a startup together about ten years ago, just before I moved to New York. And he was the one who actually very much convinced me to sort of get out of just traditional Web 20 and come up at Web 30. So it's been a fun little journey, sort of porting my knowledge into the crypto space this past couple of years.
00:02:07.190 - 00:02:13.878, Speaker A: Awesome. What about synthetics? Can you give us kind of just a brief idea, maybe for those that aren't sort of aware of what you guys have built?
00:02:14.044 - 00:02:14.386, Speaker B: Yep.
00:02:14.418 - 00:03:01.266, Speaker C: So synthetics is a synthetic asset platform on Ethereum. We were originally called Haven when we were simply a stablecoin project, but then we pivoted about. Around about December last year into synthetic assets. As we sort of saw the writing on the wall where the stablecoin industry was at very regulated stablecoins that we originally didn't think were going to be a thing became a thing with things like Gemini, Paxos. And at the same time, we sort of realized we had this ability to denominate a collaborative debt pool, if you will, denominated in different types of assets. And so we started doing it with foreign currencies. So we started with, like, JPY, GPP, and gold and silver.
00:03:01.266 - 00:03:46.958, Speaker C: And then we introduced synthetic bitcoin earlier in the year, and that's really started to see a lot of interest. And then from there, we started adding other crypto assets. And basically, I think a big part of it. One, our success has been because we are really well placed as Defi has been accelerating. But two, let's be honest, there's a lot of capital in Ethereum, and it can be very easily allocated to the synthetic prices of a lot of things. And synthetics enables that very easily due to the fact that the sole system is incentivized by everyone who stakes in our system. So the people who hold SNX, they stake in the system, they basically have a debt position, and for that, they get rewarded.
00:03:46.958 - 00:04:02.730, Speaker C: And that debt position can then be traded into other synths, so enabling people to basically get access to synthetic assets and even inverses, which is our kind of solution for shorts in a way that you can't really do otherwise in Ethereum.
00:04:03.390 - 00:04:06.380, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you very much for that. Johan. How about.
00:04:11.650 - 00:04:45.000, Speaker B: I got into crypto a few years ago. So first I got into the interoperability space. I think what's very interesting with interoperability is really, currently, the blockchain ecosystem is extremely siloed. Right. We are siloed between blockchains, but mostly between blockchains and the real world. So seeing and working through how we can make the blockchain more connected, more connected to real world use cases, more connected to interoperable between different platforms, was always something interesting for me. So I joined Chainlink about eight months ago.
00:04:45.000 - 00:05:44.774, Speaker B: My main job has been really to work on integration. So working with very smart people like Justin here and other DeFi teams and Defi projects, or basically crypto projects, to see how Chainlink can help them to work on Oracle. Then basically this kind of part of the stack, which maybe they don't want to focus on that much because they have so much other work to do. Right. They have so much other stuff to work on, being able to see how chaining can take this worry from them and can help them scale and can help them create a framework which is secure to get data from the real world into their dapps. So that's been the stuff I've been mostly focusing on over at Chainlink. Now, as far as defining Chainlink, I mean, chaining for me is really a framework to get connected to smart contracts and basically leverage the full power of smart contracts, right? So smart contracts have really nice properties, properties such as determinism.
00:05:44.774 - 00:06:39.322, Speaker B: Whenever they should execute, they execute, and that's cutting basically the middleman, which basically has been at the center of every transaction. So currently, if you want to attach to a contract in the railroad between one person and another, you need a third party. Right? Smart contracts allow to cut this third party and to have very strong security guarantees on the execution of a given contract. Now, the issue with this smart contract is that they need real world data to get any kind of interesting use cases, right? They need pricing data. So the FX and commodity prices we've set up for synthetics, for instance, they need any kind of data basically to get interesting use cases like derivatives, contract insurance products, all of this stuff. And there are many ways to get this data. There is a safe way which is basically leveraging the lessons of blockchains we already have.
00:06:39.322 - 00:07:28.122, Speaker B: Decentralization is key, having multiple nodes across the world which are incentivized to run and to get consensus. In the case of blockchain, it's consensus on the state of the network. In this case of Chainlink, it's consensus of the state of the data. What is the source of truth, basically. So, yeah, basically kind of our goal that Chainlink is the same way developer right now, if he wants to create a DAP, will use Ethereum by default because they don't have to create their own blockchain this way. Right? It's not their main use case. Well, we would like developers who want data onto their smart contract application to use chaining by default, because their main use case is not to build oracles, it's to maybe recreate finance, recreate the insurance world.
00:07:28.122 - 00:07:57.922, Speaker B: And that's already a lot of work. So being able to have a platform that you can trust and you can leverage is extremely important, in my opinion. So that's kind of our mission, chain link, offering developers and companies the ability to use oracles and to access data in a safe way without having to pour 50% of their resources into it and without risking any kind of failure there. That's it.
00:07:58.056 - 00:08:18.374, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for that detailed description. That being said, we'll kind of go into some of the Q A part here, and we'll start with Justin with these. And then, Johan, you can chime in some of these. It may make sense for both you to speak, and sometimes it may just make sense for one. And so we'll kind of take the conversation there. So, that being said, we'll start with you, Justin.
00:08:18.374 - 00:08:22.320, Speaker A: Why did it make sense for you to pursue this integration with Chainlink in this.
00:08:24.850 - 00:09:09.002, Speaker C: Mean? I think many people have sort of heard about our oracle incident that happened in late June of this know. It was obviously very, quite a famous thing, and a lot of people have attached it to the narrative know. This is the problem with running a centralized oracle. And I think for us, the thing that's always been, always been the goal of the entire team is to move to most decentralization. It's not really the fabrical ethos of the team to sort of accept the current status quo. And the idea of trusting companies or trusting us as core team is just not something that we think is a viable long term solution. And it made sense for us to have a centralized oracle in the first place.
00:09:09.002 - 00:10:03.382, Speaker C: I think both Kane and I do have and the rest of the team have a lot of startup experience, and so for us to be able to move ahead and bootstrap from day one was really important. So it made sense to decentralized. But the writing has been on the wall for a long time. Even well before the oracle outage, that we needed something decentralized. Our community's been talking about it for a long time, and I'm trying to think of when we did the first. I think it was even almost a year ago when we first basically did our first r D into Chainlink and sort of looked at that because they were the clear front runners in the space. Excuse the know, when we looked again after the oracle outage, a lot of teams had come to us and know, hey, here, we heard you had a problem with oracles, and we really did our due diligence and looked around and we said, well, Chainlink is definitely the most established.
00:10:03.382 - 00:10:10.240, Speaker C: And every time we dealt with them, the level of expertise was kind of incredible. So I feel like we're in good hands.
00:10:10.930 - 00:10:25.970, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you very much. I don't think most people realize the length of time. Sometimes these integrations can take sometimes over a year to actually make something happen together. Johan, that being said, why did it make sense for you to work with synthetics?
00:10:26.870 - 00:11:30.870, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. When I was talking about Chanlink, I was really saying that our role in this ecosystem, I see it as being a tool provider for teams to kind of build out their vision and having a platform to rely on which will provide data, which will provide it securely in a decentralized manner. So, yeah, basically, synthetics is building out something which is really important for the ecosystem. In my opinion, they've been getting more and more in traction because they're really showing what you can do on blockchain as far as finance goes, and I think they keep pushing the boundaries. So being able for us to support this kind of project is really important. In the end, the success of ecosystems, like the DeFi ecosystem, like the insurance ecosystem, all of these on blockchain, our success depends on their success. If you are able to help them succeed in their vision, then basically we'll have a thriving ecosystem where basically the network will keep running and where non operators will be able to get incentivized by providing data to these key players.
00:11:30.870 - 00:11:46.334, Speaker B: So, yeah, I really think synthetics is a perfect case for chaining, and it's been a thrill working with them. So basically, it made a lot of sense for us to support them and to work with.
00:11:46.532 - 00:12:02.750, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Thank you very much. Moving on to the next one. Justin, what do you think the actual value is? You touch a little bit on this, but what's the actual value in using a decentralized oracle versus, like, a centralized oracle controlled by a single mean?
00:12:02.820 - 00:13:02.390, Speaker C: I think trust is really the big mean. Basically, you would imagine that anyone or sort of a number of people in the core team of synthetics could basically be corrupted, be bribed, or any reason to change what comes out of the oracle. Moving over to Chainlink basically prevents that to the point where there's no way that anyone in the team owner or even anyone in Chainlink can just magically change prices. So it's really just that concept that people can rely on. The fact that, well, I can actually see that people have crypto economic. These providers of prices have crypto economic incentives to not cheat, whereas right now they don't exist. Well, I mean, for the centralized oracle we have, we still don't really exist, except for perhaps you could say that there's reputational risk and these things, but that's obviously, as we all learned, it's not sufficient in crypto to keep people's faith in a decentralized platform alive.
00:13:03.450 - 00:13:16.250, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you, Johan. I don't know if you wanted to add anything to that, but maybe perhaps with the various teams that you speak with is it kind of similar feedback that you've received as what kind of Justin just spoke upon?
00:13:16.670 - 00:14:03.402, Speaker B: Yeah, it's extremely similar feedback. I think it will always be very similar to what Justin just said. I don't have much to add to this. I think also basically building an oracle, operating it, monitoring it is a lot of work, as Justin knows already. So being able to rely on operators whose whole job is to run blockchain infrastructure and who are DevOps security experts, because Chainlink is not the one running the nodes. It's third parties, basically, who have multiple years of experience and who are running these nodes and who have a pager duty alert at night if need be, if their node goes down, and who are able to work in very stressful situation to basically counter any attacks or basically make sure that their node is always running. So that's a full time job.
00:14:03.402 - 00:14:25.250, Speaker B: Being able to monitor nodes and having a network of decentralized oracles like this, who are able to keep track of the security of these nodes, is extremely important, in my opinion, and makes a lot of sense in the current state of the ecosystem, where people might not have the time, with everything that's moving so fast, to have another full time job, which is monitoring an oracle.
00:14:27.510 - 00:14:27.874, Speaker A: Great.
00:14:27.912 - 00:15:00.300, Speaker C: Thank you so much, Johan. I was actually on vacation when we had our famous oracle outage, and I just was scrambling to get three g at the time. It was very unpleasant. So, yeah, monitoring oracles, having a sort of a small team doing that, I mean, it's handy if you distribute around the world, but only have a small team for a whole set of oracle. Pricing is very stressful. Mariano from makers talked about this a bit, because he's been head of oracles, and he's talked about the sort of stress that he had, he used to have on his end, and it's not pleasant to have it only rest on a few people.
00:15:01.250 - 00:15:19.794, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I guess that building on that as well. There's obviously a certain number of kind of price feeds that these decentralized oracles are feeding into. Is there an opportunity for that to expand? Is that the way it's going to be for a while, Justin, how do you kind of see that sort of developing over time?
00:15:19.992 - 00:16:25.314, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, we just went through phase one, which was just forex and commodities, so that was our five forex prices and two commodities. And actually, our fees right now are currently denominated in the forex. Our fees are denominated in this thing called xdrs, which are synthetic, drawing rights a little bit similar to the idea of general finance, of drawing rights, and it's a basket of these currencies. So definitely moving to even the phase one and forex, even though it might from outside seem like somewhat minimal due to the fact that those are much more, much less volatile assets. The truth is, this really is actually quite key to our system, that those prices are valuable. So for us, that phase one was obviously very important, but we're definitely on track to get to phase two, which is pretty much the remainder of the crypto prices. Because all the crypto prices, if you get Eth, for example, you'd also have to do inverse eth, right? Because on our current inverses, it's a pretty simple calculation, but right now it's done on chain.
00:16:25.314 - 00:17:15.074, Speaker C: So we just have to basically pull from ETH. We'll pull from the chain link eth aggregator, and that would both supply, obviously, the price for the short and the long. So yeah, we're definitely on track to continue the integration. The only other thing, I think the only other slight complexity is getting the indices working. So we recently, recently, I guess, back in around Berlin, blockchain week, we announced the sex token, the SCX, the centralized exchange token, which is an index of things like Wabi's token, binance, kucoin, and basically that's a basket of a number of different units of these. And so when we created them, the balance was such that so many kucoin and so many of Huabi tokens altogether was about $1,000. But obviously, over time that shifted.
00:17:15.074 - 00:17:46.290, Speaker C: And so calculating these prices is something that the chain link nodes are going to do using our code that says this is what the weightings are, and then they're going to be calculated off chain and then pushed on chain. And that's something, obviously that's going to take a bit of coordination. So it's probably like the last remaining piece, but we're definitely on track to decentralize everything. And I'd say from our end, it would definitely feel better for everyone speaking to be completely decentralized and remove that centralization risk of our oracle.
00:17:46.870 - 00:18:04.310, Speaker A: All right, Johan, I guess that kind of goes to you. Obviously, there's a set number of feeds that currently exist, one's created for synthetics, there's BTC USD, which was recently done, as well as ETh USD. Do you see that kind of continuing to grow over time as well for Chainlink?
00:18:04.730 - 00:18:27.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, sure, as far as the fees, they're not the one to answer because it's really on the user. The user can use chainlink to get anything he wants. Right. So whatever synthetics needs, they can use chaining to get it. And whatever the other dapps needs, they can use chaining. So, as we grow, we'll get more feeds. And as we talk to more projects, which is happening, we'll get more feeds.
00:18:27.674 - 00:18:41.810, Speaker B: So, yeah, as we expand the ecosystem, the feeds will come with it, because defi projects actually need a lot of different prices. Synthetics needs a whole bunch, and we have other use cases where people need a whole bunch of prices. So that's going to expand.
00:18:43.510 - 00:18:57.560, Speaker A: Okay, Johan, I'll kind of keep it here with you. I know. Architecturally, I believe you're using something called a flux monitor, which basically monitors the price, and then there's a trigger. Can you explain a little bit, kind of, maybe, architecturally, sort of, how something like that works?
00:18:59.370 - 00:19:25.474, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, it's very simple. It's basically a piece of software which monitors the off chain price of an asset. Basically, it will compare the onchain price and the off chain price. Right. And whenever it sees a 1% deviation in the price, so 1% change, it will send a request to update the onchain price, because it will track the volatility there. That's a really important piece of technology.
00:19:25.474 - 00:19:48.780, Speaker B: Because you don't want to update the price on a circular basis. Right. Maybe sometimes whenever you want to keep the price updated on, let's say, 1 hour heartbeat, like we have with ZX and commodity, just because you need to refresh these prices from time to time, because they are not super volatile. But for prices which move a lot, being able to update whenever there is a 1% deviation or any kind of deviation, is super important.
00:19:50.990 - 00:20:03.120, Speaker A: Great. Justin. I know in our community, I'd seen a lot of people kind of say, okay, maybe 1% deviation. That seems like a lot. Why does that solution work for synthetics in this case?
00:20:04.690 - 00:20:53.734, Speaker C: Well, I think one of the challenges with something like synthetics has been that many people are anchored into thinking about oracles for traditional order book traditional dexes, and they're like, oh, a traditional Dex. The user will ask what the price is, and they'll wait till they get a price, and then later on, they'll transact. But for us, every synthetic asset we have represents part of the debt pool, right? So if. Let's say that all of the debt pool was denominated in us dollars, then, okay, that's obviously not going to change, because that one synth doesn't change. Everything's set to a dollar. But if everything's denominated in ETH and ETH price changes, then the debt pool has obviously grown, grown or shrunk, depending. So for us, it's not viable to be constantly requesting, say, well, what is the price? And then waiting.
00:20:53.734 - 00:21:43.200, Speaker C: We need to know on chain atomically what debt do we have outstanding? So that means we need, instead of a pull model, we need a push model. So we actually need these prices in. And that's how our oracle has always worked. Our centralized oracle has always been looking for time of update versus price deviation on chain versus off chain. And so for us, obviously, it's clearly important, right, because anyone can move into a price or to a synth, shall we say, as quickly as it takes for the block to be mined. And so obviously, if the price on chain is deviated significantly from the price off chain, then someone can make some profit there, some risk free profit. So the 1% target is such that it basically tries to capture the fact that we have fees, which are currently at 50 bips, so 50 basis points, which is 0.5%.
00:21:43.200 - 00:22:02.980, Speaker C: And we see that 1% is like a reasonable compromise right now that our fees would capture that deviation if it's over 1%. But there is still obviously a bit of a window there between 50 bits to 100 bits. But we can talk about that, the sort of solutions we have for that.
00:22:03.510 - 00:22:24.490, Speaker A: Awesome kind of saying with you, Justin. I think, what is the next kind of hurdle? Obviously, I know I've seen some sort of posts where you've talked about, okay, we're decentralizing the oracles, kind of what's the next step for kind of you and your team to sort of work towards that kind of decentralization goal that you guys have set for yourselves?
00:22:24.990 - 00:23:14.134, Speaker C: Well, definitely a DAo is the thing that Kane has been talking, our founder, Kane's been talking about a fair bit. It's definitely something that we're pushing very hard internally. We have just been talking about it, actually, we spent a long time talking about it yesterday in the morning as a team, this idea of really being able to take the entire, right now, what we have a foundation and obviously turn it into a dow. And we're currently talking about having multiple dows for different parts, like one part for foundation or the treasury or something, one part for technical, one part for the community. And we think that that will really take us to the next place that we need to be as a team. But also that part of that too, is about making sure that we have even more removing more trust. So right now, we do have owner access over certain things in our contracts, and that's definitely, again, something that the community trusts us with.
00:23:14.134 - 00:23:30.800, Speaker C: But it's something that we know. It's a bridge we need to cut. And as part of the dows, it's something that we're going to be cutting those bridges for us, just as the team to be able to change those change owner actions will be something that a group of people, stakeholders, will be able to actually do in the near future.
00:23:31.570 - 00:23:43.986, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much, Johan. Kind of getting one sort of individually for Chainlink. What's sort of the current focus of the team right now, and what is it sort of looking to kind of incrementally build, sort of in the short.
00:23:44.008 - 00:24:21.998, Speaker B: To near mean, I think currently the main stuff is really having more and more network growth. So being able to more and more sustain and help the ecosystem, basically. I think we really have a vision of helping the ecosystem now today. Right. So what makes sense today, what is being built today? I think Defi is something which is super important, which really is working right now on Ethereum. So for two years, for people who've been in Ethereum for a while, we were kind of in this desert, right, where not really a lot of stuff was happening. There were a lot of promises, but not really a lot of projects were really building stuff which people could use.
00:24:21.998 - 00:24:54.182, Speaker B: Right. And today we kind of have this oasis, which is Defi, which is really projects which are building stuff which could really revolutionize the way we do finance. Right. And it's a really great use case for blockchain technology. So being able to support these projects, as we are doing with synthetics, is something that's super important for us. As far as core features, we are working on a bunch of really cool stuff. Of course, there is stuff like staking, which is in the pipeline.
00:24:54.182 - 00:25:43.226, Speaker B: There is stuff like threshold signatures. All of these basically component core features will help secure, build a more secure system with stronger crypto economic guarantees, for instance, for staking and threshold signature to make a more sustainable system where basically Ethereum, as a lot of people know, is not super scalable right now, threshold signatures will help tremendously by providing more decentralization, because basically the cost of sending responses on chain will be much cheaper. Right. Much cheaper means more oracles. More oracles means more decentralization, which amounts to more security, which in the case of a DeFi ecosystem whose value keeps rising, rising, rising. You probably want more security. Those are the main stuff we're working on.
00:25:43.408 - 00:26:05.490, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much, Justin. Kind of moving on to sort of a bigger question. Working in the DeFi space right now, what do you think is kind of the next big hurdle for the entire space to really take that next step? It's been very exponential, I think, over this past year. What is that next thing, in your opinion, that really has to happen for it to continue that sort of movement?
00:26:07.270 - 00:26:43.100, Speaker C: Yeah, it's an interesting one, isn't it? It's interesting to try to sort of think like, what we all map our narratives right onto what's happening. And crypto is such a complex space that that's all we're going to do, trying to find a narrative and latch onto it and maybe retrospectively be like, see, I was right. And maybe it's a bit trite to say this, but I do feel like right now it's all ethereum. People kicking the tires, people who have ether, and they're moving around, doing things with it. People are just seeing what's possible. I do feel like we need to get outside of that at some point. People outside of the ether space.
00:26:43.100 - 00:27:26.438, Speaker C: Is it people like our friends, a community? It's interesting to say. It's hard to know. Do they have capital to deploy to try this out? I've talked to various people in my family and my friends, and a lot of people do get it, definitely. People who anchored in traditional finance will get it, get kind of what we're doing and what defi is happening more. But this whole money Lego business, this whole idea of composability, this idea of writing code that takes one piece of finance and connects it to another, I've definitely seen a lot of people's eyes light up when they see that, and then they kind of get even if they're not engineers, they get this sort of idea. So I'd like to bring in more people who are maybe from the outside. And I think for me, as an engineer, I definitely learn best when I tinker.
00:27:26.438 - 00:28:08.294, Speaker C: And I think that I'd love to see more people start understanding how finance works by able to play with some of these. Maybe play is not the right word, but to tinker with some of the stuff with small scale so that they can actually learn and understand how these financial products work. Because there is a lot of. There's a big gap, a big chasm there, I think, between, for all of us, perhaps compared to full traders. As I tinker more into something, like, if I go, you're playing the BitMex. If you've never really worked with derivatives, it can be quite intimidating when you first look at it to be like, what's going on here? And I think that a lot of people just don't have access to that. And slowly bringing in more people from the outside and actually getting them, sort of educating them on how finance works.
00:28:08.294 - 00:29:15.654, Speaker C: Once kicked down the door, perhaps, of this sort of very established industry, and make people realize they could talk intelligently about these topics to people who might have been trading for 20 years after maybe only doing in crypto for a year, which is pretty powerful, because then all of a sudden, this group of people who've had this power to basically maneuver the financial market may slowly realize that new people can actually start to understand what's going on in sort of a meaningful way, that perhaps we've all seen the big short and we sort of get, okay, I get what mortgage backed securities are and how it worked, but once you've been in sort of the space as a user, I think you can really viscerally understand it so much better, even though, of course, it's different. They're like credit default swaps, kind of insurance. These are very kind of complicated derivatives. But I feel like we have the opportunity to keep educating people in a meaningful way. And I think the next thing for Defi, I feel, and again, it's tried, is bringing in that some of those people, more of our extended community, sort of get this and, okay, this is getting the stuff. And I'm starting to see how this maps to what's happening in the real world. Yeah.
00:29:15.654 - 00:29:18.270, Speaker C: What goes from there, who knows?
00:29:18.610 - 00:29:46.280, Speaker A: Awesome. Great answer. Yeah, thank you. I think there's only so many people that even understand traditional finance, and then you have the people that understand crypto and traditional finance, and it's a small group of people, but I think given enough time, hopefully enough people will spread the word that we can start bringing more and more people into this space. Pretty exciting stuff. And again, the rapid growth in defi, I think, shows that, at minimum, the crypto community is enjoying it. Interesting to see what happens when it really expands to sort of the greater world there.
00:29:46.280 - 00:30:20.626, Speaker A: What we're going to do now is we've kind of gone through this first section. We did have some community questions, so we're going to work to answer some of those now to the best of our ability. Again, if your question doesn't get asked, by all means, hop into synthetics as a discord as well, that are very active in. We have multiple channels over at Chainlink, so hop in there. If you didn't get them answered, we'll do our best to certainly answer them for you after this. So kind of the first one here. Do you foresee that the scheduled heartbeats will suffice for the synthetics exchange needs? Will there ever be the potential for on demand pools? So I guess, Justin, this one's a little bit more directed towards think.
00:30:20.648 - 00:30:48.266, Speaker C: Right. So right now we have the heartbeats. The Heartbeats have been set up to an hour and I think eventually they're going to slow down more. I mean the hope is really that, well, the trust has got to be on deviations, right, that users know, we know that the price is based on what we've seen. The oracles will update when they see a deviation of a certain amount. The heartbeats really are just that, right? Like just making sure, like, hey, we're alive. Our centralized oracle had obviously a lot more heartbeats because it's just a lot cheaper and easier to do.
00:30:48.266 - 00:31:29.094, Speaker C: We don't have a single centralized oracle to do it, but over time we have to adjust our system, basically handle longer and longer times between. And I think from our perspective it is a little nerve wracking, I think, to relinquish a little bit of that control and relinquish that. Okay, we have a centralized oracle that we know and rely on, but that's kind of part of this. So I think in the short term, as we have the 1 hour heartbeats, that's definitely not a problem. I think as we sort of transition to twice a day heartbeats. And I hope by that point that we are actually confident that what's been happening, the system is working. I think, I guess that kind of is trust again.
00:31:29.094 - 00:32:01.538, Speaker C: Right. But it shouldn't have to be. But that's how we humans sort of work. We as a team, I guess, have to trust that this decentralized system is working. Even though everything's in place for it to work, it's still a little scary. If anyone's ever worked on production code and then had to change it and there's no test for it, it can be pretty scary because you're like, well, this thing's been working in production for how long? And now we're moving it to something else that you haven't used in production. To answer your question about the pools, I definitely think it's possible.
00:32:01.538 - 00:32:54.526, Speaker C: It's not how, as I mentioned before about how our debt is denominated and stuff like that. It's problematic. I think our whole system is architect in a way that we need to know what the debt is at any moment. And that is, let's say you did only a pool model, then how would you know, if any, the system ever wanted to know what the current value of the debt pool is? Or it'd have to go out and then wait asynchronously for a response to come back and say, okay, this is what all the price is of everything. But that being said, we've iterated on many, many different ideas in the past, and we're even right now talking about siloed collateral for e as collateral. So definitely there could be, well, an option to have this idea of as a different part of our debt pool, to have parts of that managed with a pool model. And we're also looking at synthetic positions, which is more of our kind of pie in the sky idea of leverage trading on Ethereum.
00:32:54.526 - 00:33:15.740, Speaker C: And that definitely, for example, could also be an area where we could do a pool model for pricing. So there's options for it for sure. But right now we're just trying to move over to decentralized oracles with chainlink in a way that that is smooth and air prone free. That keeps us the parity, I should say, before we look at moving to the pool based model.
00:33:16.110 - 00:33:35.120, Speaker A: Okay, thank you very much. Very thorough answer. I appreciate that, Johan. I guess this one's a little bit more for you, but can you talk at all about the actual chainlink nodes that are kind of providing the price feeds for this integration? Is this something that can be seen or displayed anywhere for people to kind of see how the interaction is taking place?
00:33:36.050 - 00:33:52.230, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. We've created visualizations and I mean, you can see everything on chain, right. Also, who's running what and you can see the transactions. So all that is fully transparent. I think we can drop the links for the visualizations after, right somewhere. Sure. Yep.
00:33:52.230 - 00:35:00.890, Speaker B: As far as who's running these mean all the people running the nodes are basically blockchain infrastructure companies. So you probably know about blockchains like cosmos, like stezos, which kind of sprung up this community of people we call node operators. Node operators are basically people whose job is to operate full nodes and secure networks, right? So on Cosmos or Tezos, they stake, for instance, tokens or I'm talking about this platform. Those are just examples of very strong communities, non operator communities, where people basically operate infrastructure for a living. They get paid because they operate this infrastructure, right. They get paid through inflation on these networks, on chaining, basically, most of the chaining node operators are basically these people, blockchain infrastructure professionals who've been doing this for years, who have mostly a background in DevOps and security and basically who know how to handle very high availability systems like the ones which are required here. So those are the people running the nodes.
00:35:00.890 - 00:35:44.220, Speaker B: It's kind of great in the way where, in a centralized system, basically, you can have a super competent team running one node. In a decentralized system like ours, you can have 20 super professional teams from all over the world monitoring their node, but also monitoring other people. Right. If they see that someone is down on a reference contract, they can ping him, hey, you're down. You see, like, you have multiple people whose job is to monitor their nodes, but also monitor others, and they run these very secure, very reliable infrastructure systems, and they've been doing it for years. So those are the people kind of securing these reference contracts right now.
00:35:44.910 - 00:35:50.250, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you very much, gentlemen. That just about wraps it up for us with our questions.
00:35:50.320 - 00:35:50.554, Speaker B: Again.
00:35:50.592 - 00:36:20.230, Speaker A: If you have anything else you want to ask, certainly feel free to do so on the various channels. I want to thank Justin and Johan for being here. I know Garth is a behind the scenes guy at synthetics and really helped me put this together, so I certainly want to thank him as well. Again, this is the first time we've done this. So, as always, we'd love your feedback, what you liked, what you didn't like, and how we can definitely improve on this in the future. But I think exciting stuff when synthetics, and I can't wait to sort of read about, hear about more as this relationship develops. So, thank you once again, everybody, for joining us.
00:36:20.230 - 00:36:25.480, Speaker A: Have a great morning or a great evening, wherever you're located at, and we look forward to the next time. Thank you.
00:36:26.090 - 00:36:26.834, Speaker C: Thanks, Rory.
00:36:26.882 - 00:36:30.210, Speaker B: Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Justin. Bye.
