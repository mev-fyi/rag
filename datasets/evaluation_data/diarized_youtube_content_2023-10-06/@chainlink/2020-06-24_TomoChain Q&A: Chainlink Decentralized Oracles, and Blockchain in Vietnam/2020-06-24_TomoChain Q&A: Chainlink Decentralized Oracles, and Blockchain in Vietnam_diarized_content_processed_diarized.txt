00:00:00.170 - 00:00:00.574, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:00.692 - 00:00:01.600, Speaker B: Hi, Long.
00:00:02.370 - 00:00:03.434, Speaker C: Hi, Ken.
00:00:03.562 - 00:00:06.400, Speaker B: Cool. Are you all set?
00:00:07.010 - 00:00:07.760, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:08.210 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker A: Sweet.
00:00:08.762 - 00:01:07.294, Speaker B: I think we can go ahead and get started. Yeah. I really want to thank the Tomo chain community, the Chainlink community, and the blockchain community for joining us today. We got a really special guest, long Guoon from the CEO of Tomo chain is joining us. So the goal of this Q A is to allow the community to learn more about the integration between Tomocain and Chainlink, explore all the new products and features and everything that Tomocain is developing, as well as what makes this integration unique and tomo chain's very unique approach to decentralized finance and blockchain in general. I also want to thank both the teams and users of each product, as well as the teams that helped kind of put this together and helped make this a reality. So our agenda today, it'll be about 15 to 30 minutes of Q and A, structured.
00:01:07.294 - 00:01:45.200, Speaker B: If you have questions, feel free to drop them into the YouTube chat, and we'll be able to get to some of those as well. And if you have questions that are not addressed, you can always drop by the Tomo chain telegram as well as the chainlink channels, and we'd be happy to help answer those afterwards. So without further ado. Yeah, really appreciate you coming long. Maybe you can start by just introducing yourself a little bit about what you do at tomochain and what your team is building and what you're working on.
00:01:46.930 - 00:02:52.466, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Thanks for having me on the AMA to talk with the commodity. So, my name is long vung. I did my PhD in economics in the University of Massachusetts from 2006 to 2014, and it was in my last year of the study I got involved with bitcoin and ancoin spade. I have been on and off the spade and we started tomo chain project in 2017. With Tomo chain, we started with building a more scalable, more performant public blockchain alternative to Ethereum. And then I think we started with Ethereum code by Una, build a lot of different stuff on top of it.
00:02:52.466 - 00:03:23.120, Speaker C: And I think crypto finance and in general, and Defi in particular is something we really interested in. And recently we launched a new client upgrade called Tomox, and it allows the matching engine inside the client in the decentralized manner, and that's what we're really excited about.
00:03:24.290 - 00:03:24.702, Speaker A: Cool.
00:03:24.756 - 00:03:33.620, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for answering that. So, yeah, you guys just recently launched a decentralized exchange, is that correct?
00:03:37.670 - 00:04:40.360, Speaker C: So if you are familiar with Zero X, then I think the concept of Tomox is somewhat different, even though there is different. Right. Because with Tomox we actually being able to modify the core client to put the matching engine and the order book inside the client. So the master node who is running the infrastructure and maintaining the network is also keeping the order book for the chain. The concept here is that with public chain pipeline maintaining the exchange infrastructure, there will be different relayer on top of it. So different projects and in different reasons can run a relayer and sharing the liquidity network on Tomo chain. So it's just not one exchange, but it's more like a relay network with multiple exchange on top of it.
00:04:41.050 - 00:04:54.060, Speaker B: Got it. Okay, very interesting. So what's kind of your product roadmap look like and what are you guys focusing on building right now and where do you see it going?
00:04:55.070 - 00:06:09.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I think right now our primary focus is still on the Tomox and its reliable network and different exchange. On top of Tomox we also launch taply p two p lending. So using the Tomox matching engine we are able to build a p two p lending platform on top of it. So end user can log in and offer their USDT at different interest rates and the borrower can log in and use a collateral in BTC, in ether, in tomo to make a loan in USDT. And I think for the next three months our roadmap is still on completing and improving the Tomox infrastructure, build better liquidity network, build better tune and statistics so we can expose the Tomox to different sites like coy, gecko, coin, Marketcap and the app.com and also improve the UI US for the end user.
00:06:09.910 - 00:06:10.370, Speaker A: Cool.
00:06:10.440 - 00:06:42.640, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds really exciting. The whole lending right now is definitely a big interest to a lot of tomocain and Chainlink. So we integrated with each other a little over a year now. It's been a while and the community was really excited and gets really excited about Tomo chain. I know, I'm a big fan. What really made you pursue that integration and how does tomochain use decentralized oracles within Tomox and your platform?
00:06:45.410 - 00:07:54.050, Speaker C: I think Oracle is very important because the fact is if you are deploying smart contract on the public chain, it's very difficult to chain different parameter and different very difficult to actually use a smart contract to code to the outside service. And for example, when we are building tomox and different chains, we need especially for the P two B lending, we need a price for different assets so that we know when to liquidate collateral. Right. And that's why we need capital, a stable price, like real time market price for BTC for Tomo, for ether. And I think Chainlink is doing a really good job providing a stable and decentralized price for different project, different exchange on top of tomois.
00:07:54.790 - 00:07:55.454, Speaker A: Cool.
00:07:55.592 - 00:08:03.000, Speaker B: Yeah. Can you maybe elaborate a little more on which price feeds that you guys are specifically using?
00:08:04.570 - 00:09:22.990, Speaker C: So, for example, when one user want to borrow USDT and the collateral BTC, for example, automobile, so we set the collateral requirement at 150% of the value you borrow. But if the collateral price falling under line may be falling 50%, you need to top up the collateral. The collateral will be liquidated and returned to the lender. And I think the price is coming in to determine the system should liquidate the collateral. So, for example, if you make a loan today, the bitcoin price could be like 9300, but it could be like 7000, like two weeks from now. And I think the system we have, they need to depend on a stable and reliable price of BTC optimal to make the decision when to liquidate a contract.
00:09:24.370 - 00:09:57.660, Speaker B: Got it? Yeah, it's really interesting, especially with like B to B lending, which sounds a lot different than some of the other products that you see out on the market, but how vital correct price feeds can be. And you think it's just a price feed, but really it's something that is valuing a lot of money for a lot of different people. Architecturally, how was it when you integrated with Chainlink? What was kind of the process and the flow like working with the chain link team and kind of going through that process.
00:09:59.070 - 00:10:41.530, Speaker C: So I think one of the different thing about Tomo chain P, two p lending and exchange system is that we actually build the matching engine inside the client. So it's not purely smart contract by, but it's also like a client by. So I think Chainlink have excellent API and the documentation is very easy to follow, and we try to figure out how to actually using the different API endpoint and use this in our client instead of the smart contract. So it's a little bit different from other smart contract.
00:10:44.750 - 00:10:56.960, Speaker B: Sounds. Thanks for sharing that to kind of take a step back. So you guys are primarily based out of Vietnam, is that correct?
00:10:57.890 - 00:11:13.250, Speaker C: Yeah. So Tomochain is, Tetala is a tomochain company. Right. We register in Singapore, but the firing team and most of our engineers are based in Hanoi, Vietnam.
00:11:14.310 - 00:11:14.914, Speaker B: Got it.
00:11:14.952 - 00:11:15.250, Speaker C: Okay.
00:11:15.320 - 00:11:33.420, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think a lot of people are interested. So how do you see the growth of defi in Asia in general, and especially in Singapore and Vietnam? And how do you see users kind of interacting with your platform? And where do you see it going over the next three months to a year.
00:11:35.150 - 00:12:39.726, Speaker C: I think for me, Defi is really about financial freedom and you can do something do, and you cannot do what you are not allowed to do in traditional financial system. I think a lot of people chatting bitcoin and doing a lot of chatting on bitcoin because it gives them capitalize the freedom they never have in the traditional financial system. And it's particularly relevant for people in some emerging markets, like Vietnam, maybe China, India. Not so much for Singaporean, Singaporean as really well, they have a lot of financial instruments. They can even invest in United States stock market. But I think for emerging markets, DeFi is a really good tool and have a really good financial freedom they can have got it.
00:12:39.828 - 00:13:00.790, Speaker B: So with kind of like the pandemic and everything that's happening, did you notice a big difference in your region, like the way that people are interacting or how do you see this affecting the progress of cryptocurrency, blockchain, decentralized finance and everything kind of growing?
00:13:02.650 - 00:13:36.020, Speaker C: I think crypto space and DeFi space win benefit over the long term if people stay at home more. Right. I think a lot of people is already missing the conference circus, but for our team, we have one month work from home and most of the things are still running well because we communicate over the Internet most of the time anyway.
00:13:38.790 - 00:13:39.394, Speaker B: Got it.
00:13:39.432 - 00:13:39.682, Speaker A: Okay.
00:13:39.736 - 00:14:11.920, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really interesting. Is there anything else that you've noticed or what do you think can really speed along kind of this progress of getting more people? And how do you think we can kind of break down these barriers of going from this normal world with normal banking infrastructure? And how do you think more people can get more mainstream adoption using products?
00:14:16.930 - 00:15:37.640, Speaker C: There is a concept of yield farming circling around Twitter right now. Right. So people like doing kipline funding finance or uniswap so they can get yield. I think even though compile is paying like 4% API on USDT right now, but the yield used to be very high, but it's taply lower and actually tabline the more c five centralized finance like blockfly Celsius is actually offering better interest rates, like 89%. But I think for me, I'm from Vietnam and I think the people in Vietnam was not allowed to have an interest bearing USB account. And I think that's happened in other developing and emerging markets as well, like maybe Argentina and in China as well. So I think having like bitcoin or having USD account that earns some interest rate is attractive to a lot of people.
00:15:37.640 - 00:16:33.900, Speaker C: I'm having some, but I think if you want to get more people, user capital, mainstream user, the UI UA have to be more frictionless. And I still think it will take for some time, because right now most mainstream users, they are not used to keeping the keys and explaining the concept of private key. And you need to sell custody. Your fund is a little bit challenging. Yeah, it will take some time, I think. But I think every invasion, new paradigm we take early out of the first, I don't think we are at the point to go mainstream right now.
00:16:35.550 - 00:16:58.210, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely a challenge trying to explain people public keys, private keys, what I'm just explaining to friends and family. So there's definitely a learning curve, but there's making a lot of progress. When you started tomo chain, what year did you start kind of like idolizing and working on Tomo chain.
00:16:58.950 - 00:17:49.138, Speaker C: So we started the Bozec in 2017 and we did the ICO in 2018. Cabline March 2018. So I think one of the things we're looking at the consensus mechanism, and we decided to go with a variant of people, we call this POs, proof of state voting. And comparing to EOs and Chawn, we have a fairly decentralized network of delegate. So we have up to 150 master node and we actually have 150 master node running right now. Wow. Yeah.
00:17:49.138 - 00:19:02.230, Speaker C: And we have finance joining Sticker, we have Kucoin joining Sticker, and some other community member like Coy Gecko, and a lot of other indie and community node as well. So I think that's the consensus mechanism. Week later we turned into governance mechanism as well. I think that's one of the things I'm very proud of. And the next major thing we are doing is Tomox, the decentralized liquidity network that allow people to build a decentralized chain very easy and share the liquidity with the whole network. I think there is some challenging issue with the UI, not as easy you can uniswap on Ethereum, but we are improving on that. And the third major thing that is not happened yet, but we plan to do in the next couple of months is a privacy.
00:19:02.230 - 00:19:21.322, Speaker C: We have a protocol called Tomo P Tomo Privacy which uses smart contract to hide the sender and the amount of transaction unit. And yeah, I think they are some of the major things on tomo chain.
00:19:21.466 - 00:19:53.020, Speaker B: Wow, that's really interesting. Yeah, I think I was reading on your weekly rap post from last week. So there's, I think like 60%, over 60% of people that are locked up in staking in these master nodes yeah, that's really impressive. That's really cool. So you started in 2017. What was kind of like your motivation? So you have an economics background. What kind of sparked the idea of tomo chain and what made you really want to just dive headfirst and pursue this?
00:19:53.790 - 00:20:28.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that came a long way from 2014 and it's my last year of study. AMC. I tried to finish, but the study, but it was difficult and I found bitcoin. Right. But at the beginning I already kept more interested in what else can you do beside bitcoin? And I joined the NEM blockchain. I joined and founded NEm Blockchain. Damn.
00:20:28.398 - 00:20:54.880, Speaker C: Blockchain in 2014. But I left the project later this year, last year, and came back to Vietnam in 2015. So I think I am kept, like own way, like trying to build new things, more like a startup guy. And in 2017 I came back. Okay. Looking at the crypto space and I felt like Tomo chain is what we want to do.
00:20:56.050 - 00:20:56.798, Speaker A: Cool.
00:20:56.964 - 00:21:11.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we got a few minutes left. What else do you like to do, like on your free time? I know that you're a really busy person and is there anything else that you enjoy doing and things over in Vietnam?
00:21:14.470 - 00:21:36.458, Speaker C: I read Twitter a lot, follow different people. A lot of debate is going on. I think it is a very useful communication platform. You can learn a lot from following different people on Twitter. Obviously, I'm on telegram. A lot of time interacting with the community. Yeah.
00:21:36.458 - 00:21:48.640, Speaker C: Otherwise we have a team here. We play sport football with each other. I read book in my free time, playing with my family, my kids.
00:21:49.490 - 00:21:50.094, Speaker A: Cool.
00:21:50.212 - 00:21:55.300, Speaker B: Yeah. Any good books that you recommend to people that are looking to kind of get into the space?
00:21:58.070 - 00:22:27.480, Speaker C: This is a good one, right? I just bought it a few days ago. So the bitcoin standard, I think is one of cornerstone book. When you get into bitcoin space and you want to understand the monetary underpinning, the monetary foundation of bitcoin and crypto space. Yeah.
00:22:28.090 - 00:22:28.840, Speaker A: Cool.
00:22:29.530 - 00:22:40.160, Speaker B: Yeah. If people want to join the Tomo chain communities and want to learn more, do you have any place that you want to direct them to?
00:22:41.250 - 00:23:21.610, Speaker C: Yeah, I think our community running multiple telegram channel, we have the main chat, we have bright chats, we have masternote and sticker chat. And you can go to our forum at forum tomochain.com. That's where the discussion is more like longer and more talkful. And you can find different project building on Tomo chain discussing different technical things on the forum. If you want just to check out and ask a question about Tomo chain, you can go to telegram.
00:23:22.350 - 00:23:23.130, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah.
00:23:23.200 - 00:23:39.220, Speaker B: For everyone that's listening in, I'll drop those links into the description. Afterwards, we'll do a little bit of slight editing and I'll put those in there and then everyone can join those channels. Is there anything else long that you want to share that maybe that we didn't get a chance to touch on?
00:23:42.550 - 00:24:36.340, Speaker C: I think chilling have been doing great job so far, partnering with different projects in the space and also partnering with really big projects like in China. Right. So you got a very big news yesterday about partnering with a project in China. So I think if you are in the crypto space, I think you should be open mind and look at different projects. I think there are multiple projects doing interesting things like chain link and live tomo chain. I think so we are all together trying to build something worldwide and hopefully these things will stay even longer than very long time in the. Yeah.
00:24:36.710 - 00:24:37.266, Speaker A: Cool.
00:24:37.368 - 00:24:48.970, Speaker B: Yeah. Within that comment of the China government blockchain, is there anything similar kind of happening in Vietnam or any of the other countries in Southeast Asia that you notice?
00:24:50.990 - 00:25:15.600, Speaker C: Unfortunately, I think vietnamese government is a little bit slower in adoption. We have multiple conversations with the government officer and it takes some time, but I hope there will be some fruitful result in the future.
00:25:16.870 - 00:25:17.474, Speaker A: Cool.
00:25:17.592 - 00:25:48.730, Speaker B: Well, long, I really appreciate your time. The chainlink and Toma chain communities really appreciate your time and this is a really interesting conversation. So thanks a lot for joining us. I know it's evening over there, but yeah, everyone that's joining us, I think that wraps up our video Q A for today. Really appreciate all of your time. I know it's early here in the United States for you joining us here. Also want to mention that Chainlink is starting a Southeast Asia Chainlink telegram group.
00:25:48.730 - 00:26:37.782, Speaker B: So we'll also put that link into the description. We're looking for people to help us do more amas like this, run more meetups, help grow the Southeast Asia community. So if you're in that region and interested and want to help kind of build this community from the ground floor with us, definitely join that telegram group, drop us a note, feel free to message me on Twitter or Telegram wherever and we can be in touch and kind of gameplay a way to kind of go about that. Again, I really want to thank you long for joining us, the community for joining us, and other team members that also helped. I know Lynn, Rory were in the background really making this come into fruition. So thank you guys as well. We again are looking to do a lot more of these in the future.
00:26:37.782 - 00:26:52.670, Speaker B: So make sure to subscribe to the chain YouTube channel and get notified when we go live and when we promote videos and do other things otherwise. Again, thanks long and really appreciate your time. It was a great chat.
00:26:53.490 - 00:26:55.290, Speaker C: Thanks for having me, Kate.
00:26:55.450 - 00:26:55.870, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:55.940 - 00:26:58.250, Speaker B: Have a good rest of your evening. Bye.
