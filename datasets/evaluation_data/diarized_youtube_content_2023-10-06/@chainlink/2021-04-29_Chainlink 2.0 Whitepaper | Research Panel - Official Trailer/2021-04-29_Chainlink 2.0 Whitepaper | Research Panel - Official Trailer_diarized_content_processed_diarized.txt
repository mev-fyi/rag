00:00:02.730 - 00:00:40.810, Speaker A: Hybrid smart contracts as we define them in the paper are really a generalized design pattern in which very broad functionalities are available off chain but are secured or synchronized using on chain logic. Every oracle is already doing some kind of data conversion, taking data from one source, converting it into some format that can be represented on chain in the smart contract. And so if you just think of generalizing that to doing other kinds of computations besides just a minimal data conversion, I think you get this idea of adding some programmability to oracles.
00:00:41.630 - 00:01:02.670, Speaker B: Since Chainlink is blockchain agnostic. Hybrid smart contracts allow you to keep a part of your DAP blockchain agnostic as well. And so in this multi chain world you can then do less work porting your contracts and your DAP over and over to different chains because you can keep a common core or what would be an executable on a decentralized oracle network.
00:01:04.290 - 00:01:13.420, Speaker C: I think we're really going to an interesting place where blockchains and oracles combine to create an entire new definition of what our industry is about.
