00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.534, Speaker A: Joining us, if you're from the BZX community, Chainlink community, or kind of the wider blockchain community, we really appreciate you joining us today. We are joined by Tom Bean, co founder, BZX. Kyle, also co founder of BZX as well. Really thank you guys for taking the time today to share. And if you're okay, we'll go ahead and get started.
00:00:21.652 - 00:00:22.718, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do this.
00:00:22.804 - 00:00:36.562, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect. We'll. So let's start with some basic introductions. Maybe Kyle, starting with you first, would just love to know maybe a bit about your background, how you got started in this industry, and maybe how you got started with BZX.
00:00:36.706 - 00:01:11.794, Speaker C: Yeah, sure thing. So I hold a master's degree in computational biology. Before starting BZX, I worked in vaccine research. So when I was a teenager, I started playing a game called Diablo two and got interested in how to reverse engineer it. And along the way, I made quite a few friends in the security space. So in 2011, bitcoin became like a really popular topic among this crowd and I became interested in blockchains. I wasn't convinced regarding bitcoin's uses of peer to peer cash due to fiat on ramp frictions and the network effects of existing money.
00:01:11.794 - 00:01:29.690, Speaker C: But I became quite fascinated by colored coins. And when the Ethereum white paper came out, I really appreciated how it generalized all the different colored coin applications in like a single unified platform. So when I left graduate school, I used my knowledge of the space to build the capital that was used to start BZX.
00:01:30.990 - 00:01:31.450, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:31.520 - 00:02:12.600, Speaker B: And my background is in computer engineering, and I also have a master's in business. And before BZX, I worked for Nokia for about 15 years doing leading software team software architecture. I wore many hats there, but I was following the blockchain space for a while. Ethereum came around, I was very intrigued by that. And I was really looking for something really interesting to sink my teeth into some kind of new project in the space. And 2017, Colin and I had the idea for we knew each other through mutual friends and we kind of had started talking, had the idea for BZX, and it went from there.
00:02:13.770 - 00:02:26.474, Speaker A: Very cool. Well, it's so interesting to think that all these people from different backgrounds getting together and building things together. Diablo two corporate background, and yet here we are all working in the same space.
00:02:26.512 - 00:02:29.546, Speaker B: So it's just kind of cool how.
00:02:29.568 - 00:02:50.850, Speaker A: All this sort of comes together. So I'll go ahead and start with, I think, what a lot of people are really interested in, and that's BZX 2.0 and really kind of exploring what's new, what kind of people can expect, maybe some features that are going to be involved in that, and kind of a general understanding of why they should be excited about this new rollout.
00:02:53.350 - 00:03:27.950, Speaker C: Yeah, so we're hitting all the major pain points people had voiced about version 1.0. So real time charting, order histories, collateral management, bringing down gas costs. It used to be that you had to refresh fulcrum each time to see the price update, to see your position update. Now our interface and the trading view charts update in real time. So we made the protocol sleeker, more efficient, consumes less than half the gas of its predecessor. And on top of that, we're adding support for QI token to further reduce gas costs. So we're also investing heavily in security.
00:03:27.950 - 00:03:53.606, Speaker C: We got 19 person weeks of manual auditing by Pex, shield and certic. And on top of all of that, we're getting the contracts formally verified. And of course we're launching with one of the most aggressive yield farming programs the industry has seen yet. Our protocol is relaunching and we need to build substantial liquidity. So it's going to be short and concentrated with the intention of providing larger yields than anything we've seen yet.
00:03:53.708 - 00:04:15.040, Speaker B: Yeah, we just want to come back with a bang and just really incentivize people to just start using the platform heavily. Like Kyle said, we listened to a lot of feedback on what people wanted to see in the last version of BZX and kind of tried to get a lot of that in. So we think people, especially our past users, will be really happy with the new product.
00:04:16.370 - 00:04:26.338, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, no, that sounds fantastic. I know you mentioned a little bit about half the gas costs, which is pretty amazing because I know that's probably one of the bigger pain points that.
00:04:26.344 - 00:04:36.500, Speaker B: We'Re seeing right now. Right. We kind of rebuilt the protocol from the ground up and streamlined stuff as much as possible.
00:04:38.490 - 00:04:57.146, Speaker A: Perfect. And then Kyle kind of building on what you said. I know you talked about a very extensive auditing process that was involved in that. I don't know if a lot of people understand how big of a deal is that auditing process. I mean, how much resources does it actually take to go through something like that?
00:04:57.328 - 00:05:28.274, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it takes a lot of resources. And I think the biggest part is actually getting yourself to be audit ready, to have the code, be production ready, to have all the tests, to have all the tools running on it, that is the biggest part. So if you look at just like open Zeppelin or trail of bits, pre audit checklist, you already really need to bring the code to such a state that they're not wasting time on the audit.
00:05:28.322 - 00:05:53.440, Speaker B: Going over things, fixing obvious bugs and stuff like that, you want to do like substantial testing and bug fixes and all that prior to audit. Otherwise it's wasting a lot of time and it might delay the audit even more and they'll end up costing you more. So we spent a whole lot of time, we've kind of taken our time over the past few months really trying to do this right.
00:05:54.210 - 00:06:17.380, Speaker C: Yeah. And we have to meet with the auditors every week. They have suggestions. There's constant feedback, both of us working to understand and get this product out. So it is quite time intensive to work with multiple teams of auditors at the same time. But we're having a great time doing it and we feel really good about where it's at right now.
00:06:17.830 - 00:06:29.954, Speaker A: Awesome. I think in the end it's all about having the best product you can have and it's nice to see you guys taking the time to basically ensure that you have the best kind of secure, most reliable product that you have when you launch.
00:06:30.082 - 00:06:31.320, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah.
00:06:32.010 - 00:06:53.920, Speaker A: Perfect. So I guess getting in, you mentioned yield farming a little bit. We're going to circle back to that because I know that's a very hot kind of topic and issue. So we'd love to explore that with you. But I guess before we get there, obviously BZX and Chainlink, I know working together, would love to sort of delve into a little bit about how you're planning to use chain link. What purpose does it really serve on 2.0?
00:06:54.610 - 00:07:16.470, Speaker B: Yeah, Chainlink is heavily embedded into our protocol. We're pricing all the assets, pricing positions. We're going to be pricing our own token, we're going to have our own chain link feed. So it really is core to securing our protocol, having highly secure, decentralized price feeds.
00:07:16.810 - 00:07:47.866, Speaker C: Yeah. So when we first started building, there was no chain link on main net. We started building in 2017. So we didn't have the luxury of plugging into this really secure, battle tested Oracle network. And in hindsight, we should have gone with a completely centralized oracle. But a centralized oracle is such a painful thing to have to put into your product as someone who's trying to build something that's unstoppable. So centralized oracles, they're a single point of failure.
00:07:47.866 - 00:08:46.642, Speaker C: They feel like they're admitting defeat, and that's why we were so stubborn about not using one. And so when somebody performs a margin trade or they deposit collateral, we need to perform a lookup on the exchange rate to make sure that the position is properly collateralized. So it's a very core thing, and without a proper oracle, the whole system is vulnerable to attack. So, to kind of explain some of the internals of our system here, as positions fluctuate in value, we have a two tiered system to manage liquidations. The first layer is just a delegated closing contract that allows anybody to close your position for you, provided it's below margin maintenance. So calling the delegated close provides a fixed rate bounty plus a small percentage base reward. And to ensure the position is below margin maintenance, we call chainlink oracles to verify the exchange rate so somebody can't prematurely close the position or manipulate the prices of exchanges to collect the bounties on every open position.
00:08:46.642 - 00:09:32.338, Speaker C: So we think this is really fantastic and efficient system for liquidating. It's separate from the core contracts, but we believe it's the most capital efficient manner of liquidating. So currently there's tens of millions of dollars that are siphoned away from lending protocol users going towards liquidation bots and miners. We want our protocol to avoid participating in this kind of waste as much as possible. And then the second tier of our liquidation infrastructure is built into the core protocol contracts. So we simply allow liquidators to purchase collateral at a discount to determine the appropriate exchange rate of the collateral, we use chainlink price feeds. So without a robust price feed, premature liquidations could be triggered at a great loss to the then, you know, as Tom said, we're using chainlink for our liquidity mining program.
00:09:32.338 - 00:10:22.050, Speaker C: So we think this is actually a know loop ring had like a really interesting use of Chainlink to price their token and secure their system for us. Chainlink is securing our liquidity mining program. So the first stage of the liquidity mining program is just like a brute subsidy to aggressively bootstrap deep liquidity for a protocol that's just starting, but from a fresh pool of liquidity. But the second phase of our program is aimed at making the protocol sticky to the users that matter, the ones driving the cash flow. So each time a trader or borrower generates a fee by using the protocol, they earn half as much in BzRx. So we determine the exchange rate of BzRx using Chainlink oracles. There's no other way to implement a program like this trustlessly.
00:10:23.030 - 00:10:40.486, Speaker A: Very cool. I love the different use cases where different teams are using it for different things, but I think that's a very cool use case and does it in a decentralized manner. I guess getting back to decentralization, what's the value of using kind of a decentralized oracle network on BZX?
00:10:40.598 - 00:11:15.906, Speaker B: Well, it really removes the element of trust. We don't want a single point of failure. Since Chainlink has multiple vetted data sources, it's much better than just a centralized oracle. And also centralized oracle might be dependent on the team or like a script running on a server or something like that. So we want to kind of eliminate that and decentralize things as much as possible. And also we want to build unstoppable applications. We don't want something that governments and regulators can shut down easily.
00:11:16.098 - 00:11:51.070, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. You can't have unstoppable applications without decentralized oracles and you just don't want your entire application. You're building this entire edifice and you don't want it to be ultimately dependent on some script on an AWS server consistently running, not just such a weakness if that's how everything can be taken down. And supposedly you have tens or hundreds of millions of dollars being secured by what ends up being a script on an AWS server.
00:11:51.410 - 00:12:36.878, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah, no, I think that's a great point, and I think that's one of the challenges we've seen before in the past where half the Internet essentially goes down because there's AWS in Georgia or that region, and literally half the Internet goes down when that AWs farm goes down. So, yeah, very interesting. I think you're right. I think that's sort of the future. Is it getting to a point where you build something and you know that 100 years from now or even longer, it can outlive you, and there could be a point where you're able to step away almost completely from it itself, and it just operates without having to have someone with their hands on the controls all day, every day. Perfect.
00:12:36.878 - 00:13:00.680, Speaker A: So getting to yield farming, which I mentioned before, is definitely one of the hottest things. Would love to have your thoughts and kind of ideas on maybe sort of yield farming in general. I know you touched on a little bit, Kyle, on how that works in your system, but when this kind of first popped up a couple months ago, maybe not even that long, what are your kind of thoughts after seeing sort of what you've seen go on in this space?
00:13:01.210 - 00:13:58.310, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's interesting. So we've been watching the yield farming phenomenon and people talking about it, and we feel like people have been treating yield farming as this monolithic phenomenon and it's the wrong way to look at it. So even Vitalik on a recent unchained podcast, Laura Shin, he said that he views that's correct, it is unsustainable. But more critically, he said having no lasting effects. And I think this isn't true. Vitalik was looking at the yield farming program of compound and making this judgment, and it was true for compound, but not broadly. So what long term effects is liquidity mining having for compound? Was it not liquid before? Were there use cases or applications that were stymied by a lack of liquidity? The answer is no.
00:13:58.310 - 00:14:43.986, Speaker C: Liquidity mining is simply functioned as a marketing tool with no clear long term benefits. But that's not the case across each class of protocol. When you apply liquidity mining to programmatic liquidity protocols like balancer and uniswap, something magical happens. It creates a virtuous cycle where there's more liquidity and that attracts more traders and users, which further attracts users, which builds the kind of real network effects necessary to challenge the network effects of centralized exchanges. The implementation of yield farming on balancer is an inspired idea with long term ramifications for its future. And there's another aspect to this as well. Liquidity mining is great for protocols that need to bootstrap liquidity.
00:14:43.986 - 00:15:30.102, Speaker C: When a protocol is initially launching a liquidity mining program is appropriate to bootstrap its liquidity balancer checked both of these boxes when they implemented their program. So when we launch again, we will have a fresh liquidity pool that needs to be bootstrapped. And liquidity mining is an excellent way to accomplish that. But as a lending protocol, you need to ask why you're continuing to mine liquidity if you're already liquid. That's why our program is targeted and short lived. We're looking to accomplish a specific goal. Liquidity mining has great power to incentivize activity, but we need to be asking if it's incentivizing the kind of productive activity that builds network effects, or if it's simply acting as a subsidy that distorts the overall market.
00:15:30.102 - 00:15:42.040, Speaker C: Community needs to be asking more pointed questions like what network effects are you creating with your yield farming program? And it shouldn't be credulous regarding when liquidity is a network effect and when it's not.
00:15:43.210 - 00:15:54.430, Speaker B: Very yeah, the first three months, we're going to be really aggressive in the incentives we're paying. That's because we really want to bootstrap things right in the beginning.
00:15:55.810 - 00:16:23.986, Speaker A: Well, it sounds interesting, Kyle, kind of what you were talking about, how there's almost like a spectrum and how things know. There may be one type that's over here of yield farming, and one type that's kind of over here. And that the idea is that these protocols can basically learn from each other. This is what went right. This doesn't work for us. This does work for us. And that ultimately you can create something that drives benefits to your community, to your users, for, as you said, a limited amount of time to accomplish a certain goal.
00:16:23.986 - 00:16:31.114, Speaker A: And then once that goal is accomplished, maybe it ends, you can reflect on it. What's kind of the next step of the process?
00:16:31.312 - 00:16:48.800, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's just wonderful, the kind of experimentation that's going on. And it's really needed to kind of like, you can theorize about it, but to actually see it in practice and how it actually unfolds is so critical to appreciating the nuances of the mechanism design that you need to deliver on.
00:16:49.330 - 00:16:50.030, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:50.180 - 00:17:12.120, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool, I guess, Tom, let me put this one on you first. In DeFi right now, what do you think as a person building every day, every night, what do you think are kind of like the biggest challenges or the hurdles that the space is facing? What do you think kind of has to happen next for kind of all of us to take the next step?
00:17:12.730 - 00:17:40.990, Speaker B: Well, I think we want to eat CFI because DeFi, especially the last few months, has been growing so rapidly, a lot of it thanks to the yield farming experiments. But I think we want to keep growing DeFi competing with CFI in many aspects. We're still a drop in the bucket compared to CFI, but we're catching up and we intend know really catch.
00:17:41.490 - 00:18:05.906, Speaker C: Yeah, so I completely agree with Tom. DeFi needs to eat CFI and that should be our north star. People talk about, oh, how do we go mainstream? And that's just getting way ahead of yourself. We don't need to go mainstream. Crypto needs to go mainstream. And the use cases of crypto needs to go mainstream. But what DeFi needs to do is to first focus on beating CFI.
00:18:05.906 - 00:18:57.186, Speaker C: So that should be our north star. People say that the user experience for DeFi is poor, but if you look at the workflow and the frictions associated with using DeFI, they're far leaner and less frictional than any centralized alternative. The user experience pitfalls right now are all happening on the consensus layer. So the most common complaints we hear from users are that gas prices are too high and that they've run into an issue with the gas auctions when submitting their transaction. So we need two big things in order to start competing with CFI. And that's first something like EIP 1559. We need to get away from this ridiculous ux around tipping and gas auctions where people are like, oh, I can't put in any more transactions because it needs to mine the transaction of the lowest nods.
00:18:57.186 - 00:18:59.442, Speaker C: And now my entire metamask is broken.
00:18:59.506 - 00:19:06.618, Speaker B: Yeah, and people don't know what they're doing. They might have a bunch stacking up and they're just stuck for hours because they can't figure out what's going on.
00:19:06.784 - 00:20:04.270, Speaker C: And I've had friends that have used crypto since 2011 who still run into problems where their metamask gets jammed up with a backlog and they're trying to fix it. They even understand how the problem works, but it's still a pain to solve. And so I think this user experience problem is the number one thing that is making DeFi less attractive, and then it's the gas cost. So we need scalability on layer one that doesn't add extra steps. So these L2 solutions, they always add the extra step of depositing, and that's like the same pitfall that really depositing into centralized exchanges have. The one difference is that the centralized exchanges at least wait for more confirmations, which is sort of like an even bigger piece of friction. But for DeFi with L2, it still creates friction that is really important for us to avoid if we're going to beat.
00:20:04.270 - 00:20:32.950, Speaker C: And just to kind of hammer in the DeFi ux, you can go on Fulcrum and get a four times long leverage position on link in three clicks, a few clicks without depositing and waiting for confirmations. And then when you withdraw, you have to wait for that as well, and then you're paying fees both way in. So the only thing holding us back right now is really the consensus layer. The user experience is so dialed in otherwise.
00:20:34.810 - 00:21:03.586, Speaker A: Yeah, understood. And I'm sure you get this too, being on top and dealing with gas, where you get a user that has difficulty, or at least maybe in version 1.0 you did, and the first thing they do is hop in and say, hey, I'm having a problem with your platform, but in reality it has nothing to do with BZX, it has to do with what's going on in the network. And they used 30 GWe, which six months ago might have gotten the first block mind, and now all of a.
00:21:03.608 - 00:21:22.118, Speaker B: Sudden now you got to wait hours. Yeah, or see you in 4 hours or days. Yeah, I know. Unfortunately, users, they tend to blame us or the project when we have nothing to do with it. We try to help them through the problem, but it's kind of something that everyone in this space is dealing with right now.
00:21:22.204 - 00:21:32.970, Speaker C: Yeah. And it allows this sort of narrative to grow that like, oh, defi still has a long way to go with user experience, which really could not be farther from the truth.
00:21:34.430 - 00:22:02.834, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's definitely an interesting take. We had a great question from the audience, which I'd like to jump in here, and if anybody in the audience does have any questions, please feel free to ask. We'll certainly try to pick a couple. Do you know, you mentioned. I know, Tom, specifically defi eating CFI. Is there a world where there is a combination that ever makes sense? Is there a place where you could see a protocol that's. Yeah, we're part CFI over here.
00:22:02.834 - 00:22:09.640, Speaker A: We're part DeFi over. Like, do you think it could ever really coexist or work that way, or is it clearly one or the other?
00:22:11.210 - 00:22:12.790, Speaker B: You want to take this one, Kyle?
00:22:13.210 - 00:22:52.130, Speaker C: It's a really interesting question. I think that ultimately it's going to be DeFi, but I think that what we have seen is that there has been a lot of success from protocols that try to combine both elements of it. So there are still reduced frictions from these sort of hybrid systems. And we see it with things like loop ring. We see it diversify. IDEX. IDEX was super popular for quite a long time, so there is some product market fit for this instant execution, noncustodial sort of combination.
00:22:52.130 - 00:23:33.410, Speaker C: And I can see it definitely succeeding. But I think that as time goes on and as things become better for DeFi, and the network effects of DeFi really take off in terms of liquidity, I think more and more things will be shifting towards true deFi. And it's amazing that DeFi is able to grow and accumulate the network effects that it has with all of the barriers that it's facing at the consensus layer. But when those barriers are gone and DeFi actually has more liquidity, these network effects will be just completely insurmountable to any sort of centralized competition.
00:23:35.350 - 00:23:35.810, Speaker B: Wow.
00:23:35.880 - 00:24:07.818, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I think that's great. So it sounds like maybe short term, there's been some things that have worked, but you really feel that long term, I guess, the advantages of DeFi will far outweigh the advantages of CFI. Once some things kind of on the consensus layer. Perfect. So I guess going into that, are there any L2 solutions? Kyle, you touched on this a little bit. You still got to deposit into a L2, which know you're just repeating it again.
00:24:07.818 - 00:24:22.480, Speaker A: Any L2 solutions that you gentlemen have seen that look interesting, that look like, oh, maybe with a tweak, maybe that's something, or do you feel essentially we're just in the stage where everything's got to be done on the Ethereum based level?
00:24:24.290 - 00:25:43.482, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it does depend who you are to some extent, but it's been pretty clear to us every time that we see a L2 solution, it has the same problem. The liquidity is siloed. So for a DaP like us, who is highly composed with other Defi Dapps, it's a complete issue that it has siloed liquidity and it just becomes a non starter every time. And with the exception of all of DFI coordinating jointly to move to some L2 solution, I just don't see DeFi really being a L2 thing. I see DeFi being a layer one thing, and I think people want it to be a L2 thing just because L2 is so much more, it seems so much more reachable as a scalability solution versus sharding and real scaling on the consensus layer. So people want to make it happen, but it keeps not happening. And I don't think it's because of small issues in various implementations, like, oh, this roll up just needed one thing different.
00:25:43.482 - 00:25:50.990, Speaker C: It's the fundamental aspect of the silo liquidity that in my opinion, I think our opinion is basically, it'll be interesting.
00:25:51.060 - 00:26:02.800, Speaker B: To see what happens with Ethereum 20, but 10 doesn't seem like it's going anywhere for a while. People, that's where the place to be right now.
00:26:03.590 - 00:26:49.326, Speaker C: Yeah, we're always keeping our eyes open to see who's migrating where and why. But I think we're just noticing everybody on our app in our specific corner seems to be largely ignoring L2. There's people like synthetics who can move because they're not really composed with the liquidity, the underlying ecosystem. They can just get price information, like they're trading based off of price information. So they have chain link price feeds, and they don't need to be on layer one getting liquidity from Xerox or Kyber or some exchange protocol. And so that will work for them. But for us, like, if we want to interact with other DeFi Dapps that perform exchange and all of that, we can't go on L2.
00:26:49.326 - 00:27:03.970, Speaker C: And so I think we're going to continue seeing this trend of people working on L2, and it not getting almost any traction from most of the DFI ecosystem, with the exception of maybe the derivatives.
00:27:04.790 - 00:27:14.854, Speaker A: So it sounds like it's kind of a composability challenge that essentially you can't have all the money Legos unless everyone either decides to migrate together, which by.
00:27:14.892 - 00:27:18.098, Speaker B: The nature of the all of DFI on one shard or something like that.
00:27:18.284 - 00:27:21.580, Speaker A: Yeah, by the nature of the space, I don't really see that happening.
00:27:22.590 - 00:27:43.002, Speaker C: But even when we migrate to Ethereum 2.0, if you look at the current specs, D five composability is still a challenge there. So some dapps might be able to go off onto their own shard, but a DAP like ours will need to be colocated with the other DFI DAP.
00:27:43.066 - 00:27:45.582, Speaker B: Yeah, the ones providing the liquidity that we need.
00:27:45.716 - 00:28:19.660, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. In some ways, the big benefit we see of ethereum 2.0 is going to be getting these damn ponzies off of our network so they stop clogging us up. If it was just defi hanging out on one shard, then it would probably be a lot more manageable to do these transactions. And we could kick the can down the road until they can figure out how to do asynchronous crosshard communication, because that's really the holy grail of what we're looking for.
00:28:20.830 - 00:28:35.730, Speaker A: Awesome. Perfect. Very cool. We had another question for the Osmo I thought was interesting. How do you guys feel about governance or your tokens? Are there going to be any sort of governance that come with those, or is there any kind of governance layer in BZX?
00:28:37.670 - 00:28:38.994, Speaker C: You want to take this, Tom?
00:28:39.112 - 00:29:03.290, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I mean, we announced a while back the BZX Dow, and we're still moving in that direction. On day one, when we relaunch, we're going to have where you can stake and participate in governance. And we're still on track to fully decentralize with a Dow. So we're all about governance.
00:29:03.630 - 00:29:44.498, Speaker C: Yeah, if they're not familiar, we proposed a pretty novel governance structure that kind of takes inspiration from the checks and balances we see broadly across western democracies. We're trying to learn the lessons from the last 300 years of trying to build systems of governance that work rather than trying to reinvent the wheel or doing something totally different. And we think there's great promise in it. So in our system, there's a legislative branch and an executive branch. The code is law, so that's the judicial branch. Thank you, Ethereum, for solving law like that. And so people can stake to the representatives.
00:29:44.498 - 00:30:18.642, Speaker C: So it's a liquid representative democracy. The representatives can pass by majority vote a proposal, the executive can veto it or accept it. Also, the representatives could, by unanimous vote, kick out the executive. So we're the executive by default, and we're keeping our share of the ownership below 50%. So we can't get through any proposals that we want. Unilaterally. We need the consent of the community, but at the same time, if something happens to us, we're not a single.
00:30:18.696 - 00:30:20.322, Speaker B: Point of replace us.
00:30:20.456 - 00:31:06.190, Speaker C: Yeah. So we'd be replaced. So by keeping our ownership in this kind of sweet spot where we can definitely stop anybody who's trying to mess with the protocol, but at the same time, we have to work with the community and we're not critical. We feel like we're checking off all the boxes of what we really want to see from governance, and it's still practical to do things like respond to bugs. So some of these governance systems, it's all completely public. And this whole process, what if somebody finds a critical bug and can drain the contracts? It would be great if they could come to the executive or something like that, and they have a limited pause button that's allotted to them by their representatives. They can press it, come to the representative, say, hey, okay, protocol is paused.
00:31:06.190 - 00:31:20.790, Speaker C: Here's how we need to fix this and get it through. So we took even security and kind of responding to incidents into consideration in this governance system that hopefully doesn't even really need any one party to be involved.
00:31:21.770 - 00:31:56.850, Speaker A: No, I think that's an interesting approach. I think that the biggest challenge I've seen with governance systems is sort of this. It seems like it's challenging to get it right. I think it's challenging for western democracies to get it right. So I think it's also kind of challenging for anybody to get it right. But that, that right. You know, how can you stop a malicious actor from doing something truly malicious in a single vote, but at the same time, how can you create a system that's fair, where people feel like their vote or they've staked to a representative and that actually matters and they see things changing based on their viewpoints or their opinions?
00:31:57.190 - 00:31:57.940, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:58.950 - 00:32:25.466, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably a PhD in that alone. Maybe some days we'll see that blockchain governance as a no, because I just think it's pretty fascinating when you get into, a lot of people want to do it a lot of different ways. I think we're still relatively early. I don't know if there's ever going to be a winner, per se. I think it's what works right for you and your community is ultimately going to be what's right and what works for someone else may never work for you.
00:32:25.648 - 00:32:26.380, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:27.470 - 00:32:45.278, Speaker A: Perfect. Excellent. Well, I'm just checking here to see if we have any more questions. The biggest one, I guess, is update wise coming from you guys. Do you guys have any kind of time frame, any sort of goals you're shooting for for 2.0? Anything people could look out for maybe in the near term or on the horizon?
00:32:45.374 - 00:33:06.054, Speaker B: Yeah, so we've been telling people, and that's obviously what we're shooting for, is August 31, Hawaii, time to relaunch. We said the end of the month, so that's about the latest we can do. So that's really our goal for relaunch. Kyle, do you want to give some more?
00:33:06.092 - 00:33:38.978, Speaker C: Yeah. So we're coming out trade 2.0, all these new features. We're also coming out a little bit later. The design has been finalized. It's just all our front end engineers are so swamped, we're coming out with something called Fulcrum Pro. So what we've noticed is that our interface works so well for people who are not very seasoned or experienced margin traders, but it actually confuses people who are very experienced margin traders because it's.
00:33:38.984 - 00:33:41.650, Speaker B: Not what they're used to on other platforms.
00:33:42.390 - 00:34:12.718, Speaker C: They've grown accustomed to this, like, Coinbase pro type feel or this binance type feel where there's trading pairs and everything's kind of where they already know. You know, I had a friend who's like a professional arbitrage trader. He's very experienced using these systems. And when he came to Fulcrum, he was so confused and he's like, wait, I'm going long on ETH against what? What does that mean? And whereas the average person is like, oh, I'm just going long on ETH. Great. Four times. Go four times ETH up.
00:34:12.718 - 00:34:27.182, Speaker C: I'm four times up. My friend was like, I can't proceed from here. This is too confusing. I need more things specified. So that's what we're doing. We're coming out with Fulcrum Pro. It's going to have swaps on the horizon.
00:34:27.182 - 00:35:00.474, Speaker C: We're looking at two different areas, really making that swaps interface really work for us, have aggregation capabilities and really pushing on that front. And then on the other front is we're looking closely at perpetual swaps. So actually this is use case with Chainlink. We're looking at a perpetual swap that has all the properties people want, no impermanent loss. Da da da. Using Chainlink and all that. So that's an active research right now.
00:35:00.512 - 00:35:07.840, Speaker B: Yeah, we're real excited and we can achieve a lot higher leverage with that. And so, yeah, that's going to be a big thing coming.
00:35:09.090 - 00:36:04.178, Speaker C: Yeah. So one thing we realized was that at first we kind of had this really great lending product called Archimedes that we were super excited for because it would always beat everybody else in terms of price discovery. So the lending rates would always be higher, the borrowing rates would always be lower than everybody else. And we really were excited by that. We're like, oh wow, how will they deal with the fact that we could consistently always beat them on price? But unfortunately, with the yield farming craze, it's distorted the market to such a great extent and it really complicates. You would have to keep adding new things and make sure it's yield farming aware and then the value prop of it has become greatly diminished given the new competitive landscape. But what we're trying to focus on is getting volume from trading because this is where the real cash flows are.
00:36:04.178 - 00:36:18.680, Speaker C: Lending is great, but trading cash flows are amazing. And who are the people making the most in this ecosystem, like Bitmax, Binance? Those are the kind of people whose breakfast we want to eat, more or less.
00:36:20.330 - 00:36:41.580, Speaker A: Very interesting. Well, cool. And thank you for the teaser as well. I guess before we wrap this up, anything else that either you gentlemen would like to say, would like to talk about before I kind of ask the sort of what do you do when you're not doing defi question in the spare time that you probably don't have, but anything else you gentlemen wanted to touch on before we get there?
00:36:44.750 - 00:36:49.600, Speaker C: No, I think that's pretty good. I feel like we covered quite a bit there.
00:36:50.450 - 00:36:58.866, Speaker B: If any of you listening want to hear more about this, we go into certain things in more detail. We also have a community call on Friday, so feel free to join that.
00:36:59.048 - 00:37:16.806, Speaker A: Awesome. I'll get the link from you guys. We'll put that in the description as well and just highlight that for people they can deep dive. But. So it's kind of my last question as we wrap this up. I'll start with you, Tom. When you're not working, you're not involved in know, maybe you've got an hour a day where you're not sleeping or working.
00:37:16.806 - 00:37:22.854, Speaker A: What do you like to do outside of this? You got a hobby? Something that you enjoy that's not related at all. It's a blockchain.
00:37:22.982 - 00:37:46.370, Speaker B: It seems like I work so much, much to frustration of my wife, but yeah, we have a baby on the way coming just a couple of months, another baby. I have my son, so a lot of family stuff and like to get a gym workout in there when I can, but just feel like it's all work lately.
00:37:47.030 - 00:37:52.020, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say, I know for a fact that Tom doesn't do anything else.
00:37:55.110 - 00:37:59.014, Speaker B: I'm working on the work life balance, but I haven't totally figured that out yet.
00:37:59.132 - 00:38:02.662, Speaker C: Me and my wife were surprised he had time to make a kid, to be honest.
00:38:02.716 - 00:38:04.200, Speaker A: We were like, where do you find.
00:38:06.330 - 00:38:08.170, Speaker B: Stuff happens during COVID.
00:38:11.710 - 00:38:32.506, Speaker C: Me and my wife are working on having a family as well. That's one activity. And then I coded this up. So I kind of enjoy, kind of like coding 3d visual art and did some painting as well. If you check my telegram picture, his.
00:38:32.548 - 00:38:35.250, Speaker B: Telegram background is his painting.
00:38:36.070 - 00:38:43.940, Speaker C: And I enjoy writing and singing parody songs. So that's another thing that I like. I like creative pursuits and all of that.
00:38:44.470 - 00:38:49.126, Speaker B: I used to have hobies. Got to find some hobbies again besides work.
00:38:49.308 - 00:39:08.460, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, you're about to launch something huge, so obviously it's eyes on the prize for sure. 100%. Hopefully after your successful launch, be able to take maybe a breather for a little while and get a reset. But congratulations, tom, on the expecting child. That's awesome, kyle. Certainly wish you the best of luck with yours as well.
00:39:08.460 - 00:39:24.800, Speaker A: I have two daughters. It's the most incredible thing ever. The most frustrating thing ever. The most incredible thing. It's amazing. It's like everything wrapped up into one thing, I feel like, but it's awesome. I always tell everybody, well, I just want to say thank you so much, gentlemen, for both joining us again, Tom and kyle from.
00:39:24.800 - 00:39:56.566, Speaker A: It was, this was a lot of fun. What we're going to do is we're going to put in the description. We'll put all the BZX community links. I'll get the link from you for your community call as well. If someone kind of wants to deep dive and really get involved, I think it'd be a great opportunity for them to do so. Really looking forward to watching 2.0 come out, seeing the community reaction, and then hopefully after that, a little bit down the road, we can have you guys back on and you can kind of discuss what the next phase is because it's always, this is great.
00:39:56.566 - 00:39:59.122, Speaker A: And then we're always working on something else. That's your nature.
00:39:59.186 - 00:40:00.720, Speaker B: Sounds great. Sounds good.
00:40:01.330 - 00:40:01.982, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:40:02.116 - 00:40:03.998, Speaker C: Well, thank you again, gentlemen, for joining us.
00:40:04.084 - 00:40:07.598, Speaker A: Absolutely. You guys have a great day and look forward to chatting with you soon.
00:40:07.684 - 00:40:08.750, Speaker B: All right. Thanks a lot.
00:40:08.820 - 00:40:12.170, Speaker A: Thank you. Take care. Bye.
