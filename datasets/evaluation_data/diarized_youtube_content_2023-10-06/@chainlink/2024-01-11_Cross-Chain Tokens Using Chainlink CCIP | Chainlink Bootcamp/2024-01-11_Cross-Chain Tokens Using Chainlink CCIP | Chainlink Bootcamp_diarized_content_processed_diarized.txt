00:00:00.330 - 00:00:31.510, Speaker A: You. Hello everyone. Welcome to session four of our ten days boot camp. I'm so happy with all of you. I'm so proud with the exercises that I'm following your form and a lot of people are feeling the exercises are doing it. This is so amazing. And today is the day that we are talking about cross chain interoperability.
00:00:31.510 - 00:01:35.910, Speaker A: So let's wait a bit more to have more people here. And I'm preparing some material for you now. I didn't create the pad yet. Wait and welcome. Yes, I already have some help today. It let's invite you to go to the pet. Yes, I am in the right place now it so here we are.
00:01:35.910 - 00:02:46.836, Speaker A: Let's check the petition. Yes, remember to subscribe to the YouTube channel. There are a lot of amazing information over there. And this is the pad now. We are here now and follow us on the Twitter account, our official account. All the news related to chain link will be over there. And yes, I must answer another question here, Michael.
00:02:46.836 - 00:03:38.010, Speaker A: For now, until the end of the bootcamp, I will share out the code with you because I'm preparing a git book with all the exercises step by step to you to follow. For now, you must get them in the pets. Each class, each session has your own pet. I know that some people has problems including to access the pet. So probably in the rest of my day today I'm preparing a personal GitHub repo only without the codes to you to get now and then. We are using this for these days, but I'm preparing an official documentation of the boot camp with our code. Okay.
00:03:38.010 - 00:04:47.686, Speaker A: Yes, the pet is working much better in the day four and this is normal boys and girls because the people are learning and you are including learning how to use this. This is a collaborative pet, but we are all learning every time, including how to use this. I can check if some code is not over there, let me know which and I can add again or wait until the afternoon. I created this temporary GitHub only with the exercises from bootcate. Okay. Oh, some are related to the hackathons. We used to have two hackathons per year.
00:04:47.686 - 00:05:30.132, Speaker A: So the last hackathon finished in December. We are planning another on this semester. So wait a bit more and you will have news about this. Not in January. Wait a bit more. And some people are asking related to the past sessions as well. It so here I am.
00:05:30.132 - 00:06:21.774, Speaker A: Let's set some information stuff for you. If you go to our page, our official page. I'm not sharing my screen. Oh, I think not yet where I am. Yes, let's share my screen if you know. Here we are. So if you missed some session, like to review, like yesterday, one of your friends told us that he watched the session two times more to be able to do all the exercises.
00:06:21.774 - 00:07:08.320, Speaker A: This is normal, this is a lot of content and I'm so proud that you try it and did it. And if you need to see some session, some past session, scroll down here, you have the link to all the sections over there. And like these three, you can see this is happening just now and the others will be like to wait. Okay, perfect. They are here it. Okay, one more. Okay.
00:07:08.320 - 00:07:49.308, Speaker A: Related to the certification we have the. And are you added using the pad as well? Okay, let's copy from yesterday class we are using this task form. Thank you, Javier. And this task form is the base to you to get the certification. So you fill this form with all the exercises that we are doing here. So I'm asking, I cannot open it now, I need to change my account. So I'm not open it now.
00:07:49.308 - 00:08:45.070, Speaker A: But the form asks first your email, then the wallet address that you like to receive the certificate. And this can be different from the wallet that you are using to do the exercises. Why we create a testnet wallet now to do this. But maybe you already have other nfTs, other poaps in your official account and you like to receive this certificate in that official address, so you can add a different address to receive the certificate. After this, our form starts to ask all the exercises that we are doing. So what we did in the first day, create a new wallet, put the address. Did you transfer, edit the transaction, transfer.
00:08:45.070 - 00:09:22.360, Speaker A: Second day we create the hashtag, added the address of the hashtag contract. We create the hashtag access contract, put the address over there. Yesterday we create a token and then the token shop, I ask both address. Today we are creating another smart contract. That will be the cross chain token. So we're doing this now. And then you can add the address over there.
00:09:22.360 - 00:09:55.910, Speaker A: Okay. And this is the certificate will be NfT pop is this. Thank you, Kisfat Dimar. I will not see this now. This is a good question to you to try to solve it tomorrow in the session with our experts. And he should be with you as well, because he is only solving the debits. Okay.
00:09:55.910 - 00:10:34.490, Speaker A: Okay, great. We have a lot of people here. I think we are almost done to start. So good, let's go to our presentation today. And in fact we are going to other part. So here we are, session four of our chain link bootcamp. You already are in the pad.
00:10:34.490 - 00:11:13.770, Speaker A: And yesterday I introduced to you the Chainlink platform and to have you an idea what we are seeing on these days. This is all the services that we have today. So we have the data feeds, we did it yesterday, we have the data streams. I will talk about this probably in the last session. Today we're starting to talk about CCIP. We have two sessions related to CCIP. We have one session related to functions, another VRF automation and also I will present preferred reserve in the last session.
00:11:13.770 - 00:12:04.518, Speaker A: And this is an overview of everything that you can do using Chainlink. And today I'd like to introduce you our developer portal. So go to Devi chain link because you can see by product more than only the documentation. Let's go over there. It's good to do this together and I would like to have it this way. Okay, so here we are, you have some advanced examples like this. To create a prediction app or to build NFT battery review or to create a circuit breaker.
00:12:04.518 - 00:13:04.970, Speaker A: You have a lot of things to learn here that are more advanced than this course. This is the basic course for you. And you have his services related to all of our service. For example, if you'd like to see something related to CCIP like we are seeing today, we have some guides related to these transfer tokens, cross chain applications, external accounts, tutorials for beginners like I'm doing here, a lot of videos related to understand better CCIP and including how swift is using CCIP for example. This is so cool. All the documentation is here and we have a lot of interesting points in the blog like the five levels of the crosschain security. I really recommend you to see this, to read this later and this is so in the developer hub.
00:13:04.970 - 00:13:48.158, Speaker A: Go to our services and you have a lot of amazing information here for you. Okay great. A bit more related to our beginner our starting now remember that you have the slides here in the beginning. I am using the same slides this presentation. Let's add this for you in the beginning as well. So pet sites task for me. Here we are and the presentation is here.
00:13:48.158 - 00:14:21.910, Speaker A: A bit more for you. Yes, let's pass the address of the dev report here as well. I think I didn't and I close it. Okay. And yes I didn't add here. Oh crazy. Edit chain link it's here and also you'll be here.
00:14:21.910 - 00:15:09.498, Speaker A: Let's pop up it is a bit for you and the presentation because all the contents from today is in the presentation as well. It so let's go forward the tasks if you need the care code. 5 seconds to you to copy the care code to read it. Perfect. Here we are. Now we are adding. Oh, at the middle.
00:15:09.498 - 00:15:52.000, Speaker A: Wow. I did a lot of slides today. So our requirements for today, we already have the metamask wallet. We must have the link token and the testnet nativity token in other chain because we are using other chain. So today we are using the avalanche Fuji network. So in a few minutes I will come back here to do the requirements with you. Okay? No, today I'm talking about token as well, but I'm talking about cross chain talking.
00:15:52.000 - 00:16:46.390, Speaker A: So if you missed the session yesterday, you can do the session today. And then you get the video later of the other session and do this later. Okay, you can do both. And today you can do this with no problems. Okay, now let's talk about interoperability. And what is this? I'm talking about the ability to exchange information between different systems or networks even if they are incompatible. We are talking about shared concepts on different networks and also be sure that each part understands and trusts the exchanged information.
00:16:46.390 - 00:18:04.620, Speaker A: But when we do this and when we are doing this on blockchain, it's so important to take care of the finality of the blockchain. And this is something that we must talk a bit more like. What is the finality of a transaction in the blockchain is the point where the past transactions included on chain are extremely difficult or impossible to revert. And what means I send a transaction to the network now it will be included in a block. When you have a lot of blocks that happen after the block that it's my transaction in order to my transaction be reverted or to have we call it a he work in the blockchain. It's hard if you have more blocks after yours. So we used to say that to have trust finality, we must have some blocks, some amount of blocks after the block your transaction was validated.
00:18:04.620 - 00:18:37.220, Speaker A: And this depends of the network. The amount of blocks depends of the network. And also if we convert this on timing, this will also depend of the network. Because if you talk about ethereum, we are talking about 15 seconds. If you talk about polygon, choose some seconds. If you talk about avalanche, sometimes I got four transactions, four blocks per second. So this is totally different, depends of the chain.
00:18:37.220 - 00:19:28.230, Speaker A: And in the point that we have the finality, your transaction cannot be outer ed, reversed, cancelled. And you are sure that your transaction will be forever in the blockchain. So this is the immutability part of the blockchain. And also the finality can be different. Depending the network related to the instant finality or multiple confirmations. That was what I'm saying about with you. But also you can have some finality related to layer two chain that this will be confirmed when the batch of blocks will be like posted in the main chain, for example.
00:19:28.230 - 00:20:09.430, Speaker A: And some blockchains don't have this kind of keyword. So we have the instantaneous finality. Okay, so this is different. Yeah. Okay. So when I talk about the interoperability, it's a big challenger to be sure that you send a transaction to the other chain and nothing changing the middle. So the interoperability must considerate the concept of finality in each chain and only if this we have the trust in the exchange information.
00:20:09.430 - 00:20:47.170, Speaker A: And before talk about this, let's talk about this. Our form, our task for me, you must use the same email all the days. And yes, when you add your email again, you receive the message, you are right. Submitted that farm. This is right. But you can edit the form and add the new tasks. If you go over there now you can see that I added a new task to you.
00:20:47.170 - 00:21:32.860, Speaker A: So don't worry about it. Edited the form, added a new task over there. And when we talk about blockchain, blockchain, it's an isolated network. Remember that we are talking about this since the first way. This is an onchain system and this chain is isolated and they cannot communicate it in a natively way. The first approach to have communication between blockchains is the bridge at the bridges. But the traditional bridges are centralized.
00:21:32.860 - 00:22:37.484, Speaker A: It means that when you are transferring funds from one chain to another using this bridge you are essentially like giving your funds to a centralized entity. And all the time we are telling you to have a decentralized system. So this is not the best. And you must trust decentralized entity that the funds you send to them, you appear in the other side on the other chain. And if you research about, especially last year there was a numerous bridge hacks. So GZB had a normal bridge, a centralized bridge is not the best approach, is not the most secured approach. And wait a minute.
00:22:37.484 - 00:23:11.180, Speaker A: I think I must take you from here. Okay. And here we are. We have CCIP to solve this. So what is CCIP? I'm talking about the Chainlink cross chain interoperability protocol. And CCIP connects blockchain networks with lanes. So I can go from the blockchain a to the blockchain c now with one laney.
00:23:11.180 - 00:23:53.800, Speaker A: And if I go from blockchain c reverting to blockchain a, I will use another laney. So the laney is a unique combination of the Cersei blockchain and the destination blockchain. From Cersei blockchain to destination blockchain. And this is if the lane that's going from a to c is different from the lane that is going from c to a. If path has a unique lane. And here we are. We create lanes to our blockchains that we are implemented on CCIP.
00:23:53.800 - 00:25:01.760, Speaker A: So which blockchain supported by CCIP has a unique chain selector? And this chain selector is the key to identify this blockchain and to have lateness to all of them. When we are using CCAP, when we are trying to do a cross chain transaction, we have a crosschain message. And what is a crosschain message? We can have three kinds of crosschain messages. First of all transfer tokens, the supported tokens. Second, transfer send any kind of data or send both tokens and data. Today we are using only the first only transferring tokens. And next week we will have another section using CCIP with any kind of data that it will be with nfts.
00:25:01.760 - 00:25:53.490, Speaker A: When we talk about the CCIP now you know that how is the message, what kind of message we can have. But also we must understand who is the sender, who can send the transaction in the Cersei blockchain. We have two kinds of sender. We can have Eoa. We didn't talk split about this, but this is an external owned account. This is your account. That account that you created on metamask or the sender can be any smart content in the other side, who can be the receiver? The receiver can be an external account as well.
00:25:53.490 - 00:27:10.020, Speaker A: But the receiver can be any smart contract that implements the CCAP receiver. It means that this smart contract must be prepared to receive the CCAP message. One important point for you, if you are sending a message with tokens to external account, the external account cannot hang those messages, only tokens. So only the tokens you arrive and all of these happen using as much content. That chainlink deployed in each chain that it's the CCIP howuter. So this contract, the CCIP outer is responsible to initiating the cross chain interaction and exists only one outer per chain. And here EOA is external owned account.
00:27:10.020 - 00:28:02.904, Speaker A: This is Simona. Let's make the presentation better. Thank you Simona. And we was here. Let's talk about a bit more about the CCAP howuter. So using the CCIP howuter, when we are transferring tokens, the colors have to approve the outer to be able to transfer the token, to send the token, to spend the token. And when a message is received on the destination chain, the outer is the contact that delivers the token to the user account or the message to the receiver.
00:28:02.904 - 00:29:01.908, Speaker A: Smart content so this is a high level architecture of CCAP. This is you the indusr, you can interact with decentralized application which means that this is a smart contract. Here you can send a message or a token and defining the destination chain. So in my contact I tell I'd like to send this message to this destination chain. This is the Cersei blockchain. All of this is going to the and then the outer is the CCAP part can be data or tokens. This is the message when you define the destination chain.
00:29:01.908 - 00:29:55.314, Speaker A: So on the destination blockchain I have the other outer that is receiving only the message and then or the end user directly or there is much content that is deployed on the destination blockchain you take care of your message is this. We have discord capabilities of CCP. Like to do the token transfer. This is today. We are doing this today. So this is the ability to transfer ERC tench tokens to a receiving smart context or a wallet address, the external owned account. But also next week we are learning how to send an arbitrary message.
00:29:55.314 - 00:30:40.514, Speaker A: And the message can be something like hello world. But the message can be some function that you are calling in the destination smart contract, for example, we are doing this and imagine if I can do this together. I can have a program of token transfer. So I can transfer tokens with instructions. What must happen with that kind of tokens? And I receive, receive very much content. This is so amazing. And by the way, CCIP was launched in July in Paris on the ECC week.
00:30:40.514 - 00:31:23.106, Speaker A: I was there and I did over there the first CCIP workshop on the ECC. I'm so proud of this. And this is one of the services, chaining services that I really love. So imagine with everything that I told you until now, we can have this kind of crosschain stack. Imagine that you can build a crosschain wallet or crosschain application. We can have now crosschain happening in DeFi, in nfts, in games. We can have cross chain.
00:31:23.106 - 00:32:03.582, Speaker A: By the way, cross chain is so important to the enterprise and capital markets. And like bridge, you can use the CCAP to create a cross chain bridge in a secure way. And also you can have any kind of cross chain application. All of this is backed by the cross chain interoperability protocol. And I will talk about this in the last session. Don't worry about it. Another point that I'd like to highlight to you is the risk management network.
00:32:03.582 - 00:32:57.466, Speaker A: Because we have a decentralized network that is independent of the networks with the Hauters that is monitoring this and bringing security to us. And some examples what you can do. We are doing token transfer today. But imagine that you can use this to be a collateral. You deposit the collateral, the guarantee in one chain and borrow assets on another chain. Imagine that you can have the true Defi composability. We know that DeFi is related to the Monet Legos, the composability that you have as much contents, you have applications and they can communicate.
00:32:57.466 - 00:33:42.610, Speaker A: And now they can communicate in a cross chain way. Also, when you talk about nfTs, the NFT can be minted in one chain and appear in another chain or be received in another chain. This was my first workshop on HCC last year on July. Now I have most advanced workshop using NFTs and CCAP that we are using next week. Prepare it yourself. You be next Tuesday. Yes, Monday I will do the basics of NFTs like we are creating a basic NFT, we are using automation with this basic NFT.
00:33:42.610 - 00:34:34.366, Speaker A: And next Tuesday we are doing a cross chain application with mean not. It's not on my list. My problem to talk more about account abstraction, you can research about it, but the account abstraction is so important. Like to create smart contract wallets. And if you create a wallet with an active CCAP capability, you can have a better user experience to interact with application that are cross chain. And imagine this in a game world, to have a game that doesn't matter the blockchain that you are. And talking about data storage or computation.
00:34:34.366 - 00:35:29.246, Speaker A: We know that some layer two or even layer one blockchains are less expensive to do some parts. So can this strategy to you to do so complex computation in a ship blockchain and then bring the result to your main application that you did in other blockchain and marina. I love nfts. It's one of my favorite topics. So let's do this next week. This is a basic workflow of all of this and especially with the token pool that we are using today. And this is the point, you are the end user.
00:35:29.246 - 00:36:22.970, Speaker A: We are creating a sender contract today and we are sending only tokens today to the houses. And when we talk about tokens we can have this kind of on ramp, off ramp part when we are managing the tokens. I have another slide related to this, so let's go forward. This part is off chain because we must have the communication between two chains with through an off chain part. What you have in the off chain part. We have two set of nodes, two decentralized Oracle networks. One is the committing done, that is sending the information to the outer in the other chain.
00:36:22.970 - 00:37:30.080, Speaker A: And the other is the executing done, that is really executing the transaction on the outer. All of this is backed by the risk management network. It means that we have a third network, that it's independent of these two networks, that it's only checking the transaction. And we must have a consensus on this network as well. And only if this is approved. Talking about the security and the risk of this, only when this have disconcensus, the final transaction will be finished from the outer to the receiver. So the difference between CCAP and other bridges, we can say that one of the difference is the risk management network because we have entirely decentralized network only take care of the security part.
00:37:30.080 - 00:38:13.030, Speaker A: And this is every time that we talk about dawn, I taught this yesterday to you, this decentralized oracle network. Thank you. And let's talk about tokens directly, tokens that this is our subject today. We have two mechanisms to hang ring talkings. One is the lock and mint. The other is the burning mint. We are using this today, the lock and mint.
00:38:13.030 - 00:39:45.874, Speaker A: And if you are locking in one chain and unlocking in the order, or you are burning in one chain and mint in the order. And is this, imagine that you have a token in the source blockchain and to send this token to the destination blockchain we have two options. Or you lock that token ub nice much content cannot be used anymore. Or you burn the token on the Cersei blockchain and then you have it approaching the destination blockchain, you mint in the destination blockchain or you unlock on the destination blockchain. If you already have some amount of tokens over there. And this is like for example this burning mint approach. It's used by tokens that can be used on multiple chains like the stable coins, synthetic assets, the rapid tokens and the risky management network is not another layer of blockchain.
00:39:45.874 - 00:40:22.090, Speaker A: This is an off chain component. So remember that chainlink is not a blockchain. So chainlink, it's a set of decentralized networks. So this is one of the networks taking care of this. So we have these two kind of tokens, the lock and mint. Imagine that you can lock on the service and mint on the destination. Like this is the main token and this is a kind of rapid token.
00:40:22.090 - 00:41:12.150, Speaker A: And then if I'd like to use the token, the destination, I lock on the source mint on the destination. When I don't like to use anymore, I will burn here and unlock stuff like that. Lock, mint, burn, unlock. In our case we are using this today, the burning mint token. So we burning the search chain, we mink on the destination chain. And by the way, these tokens are managed by Chainlink. And to do a token transfer now you must use a token that is supported by the CCIP network.
00:41:12.150 - 00:42:03.114, Speaker A: So there are the supported tokens on Testnet we have these two kind of tokens. On Mainnet we have others and maybe others soon. We are launching something, some news for you in some weeks and this is what we are doing now. We are using the CCIP burning mint token. And this was almost the same that I did before. But I maintained this for you because talking again about the risk management network, you can see that the risk management network right on the wellness match content that we have here. Like saying that we have a consensus here, we have consensus over there.
00:42:03.114 - 00:43:16.610, Speaker A: So they are part like writing things on chain as well, interacting with the houses. Another point before go to the hands on part we must talk about billing and payments. How can we pay fees? Because imagine when we send a transaction to another chain, we must pay fees on the destination blockchain. How can I pay this? First of all, we always will pay the fee on the Cersei blockchain. But on the Cersei blockchain the outer can calculate the fees on the destination chain for you. So on the Cersei blockchain you already have an estimation of the fee that you are paying on the destination blockchain and you will be charged on the Cersei blockchain you can pay the fees. This is the gas cost but a premium to the chain link node operators.
00:43:16.610 - 00:44:02.280, Speaker A: And you can pay the fees using the link token or using the native token or some rapid like this. The native token for example in ethereum, is it in avalanche is a vax, something like that. And this is overview of the fees. And this again, I am not talking for this. I will talk about this later because I have some slides more related to the Hiskin management network. This is so important. Okay, let's go to the hands on part.
00:44:02.280 - 00:45:06.344, Speaker A: Now it's only two slides. Let's finish this so you can check this later to finish the slides a bit more related to the risk management network. You can see that they are checking repeated messages, incorrect amounts, no matching crosschain messages, insufficient deep confirmation, something like that. So the Hiski management network is looking for all of this in both chains and getting a consensus. Every time that we send a transaction, they you check if this transaction is good. If this is not creating a double spend something or a double token, dubbing the amount of a token, for example. Yes, Vandena, you already have the access to this presentation.
00:45:06.344 - 00:45:43.796, Speaker A: And I added a lot of information for you related to the interoperability. Go to the CCAP concepts related to the architecture, related to the best practice and these five levels of cross chain security. It's so useful. Okay, how is this for you? Now it's time to go to the hands on part. Let's see, how is our pet. Our pet survive until now? This is good. Let's make a copy.
00:45:43.796 - 00:46:17.548, Speaker A: I need to be sure that we can survive until the end. Wait, I am on the other blockchain now. Other screen now. Okay, here we are. Okay, let's go down and go to the requirements past. Wow, a lot of people from Nigeria. I must go over there.
00:46:17.548 - 00:46:36.770, Speaker A: This is a place that I didn't yet. I'd like to go to do a workshop with you. So. Hey, quarrelimates. Let's get my guide here. I have a guide that I'm following as well. It's a lot of information.
00:46:36.770 - 00:47:21.920, Speaker A: I cannot lose nothing. Remember, go to the dev chain link to get our information. And we have the Cersei blockchain and the destination blockchain. The Cersei will be ava lunchey Fuji. This is the testnet from Avax. The destination will be ethereum sepolia. We are good on this part, but we must configurate the Cersei blockchain.
00:47:21.920 - 00:47:57.980, Speaker A: How can we do this? First we must add a Fuji to metamask. This site is so cool to do this. And I uninstalled my wallet and installed it again to do from zero with you. Let's go. Where is my wallet? Here. Okay, so first of all, let's go to the Chainlist.org. This is an amazing site to get the information related to the networks.
00:47:57.980 - 00:48:29.244, Speaker A: And now I'm connecting my wallet with this site. Okay. And wait. My metamask is crazy. Okay, let's see if now I can connect. Try it. Okay, now I can connect.
00:48:29.244 - 00:48:59.240, Speaker A: Probably you are going directly here. Connect the chainich.org with metamask. Connect. Now you must add Fuji testnet to metamask. Okay. And this is so remember that.
00:48:59.240 - 00:49:44.358, Speaker A: Connect to wallet and then add to metamask. Now you can see here on my metamask that on my chain selector in the top left corner. I have a new network here. Avalanche Fuji and here we are. We are on avalanche Fuji. Next step, we must get some talking zones on this. I hope the official faucet is working.
00:49:44.358 - 00:50:17.182, Speaker A: Because if it's not working, I will get tokens for you. Okay, but let's try the official faucet now. So let's go to faucet. Chain link. Get Fuji and link on Fuji. Get a vax Fuji and link on Fuji on the faucet. I did it yesterday.
00:50:17.182 - 00:50:46.390, Speaker A: Probably I cannot do it again. Connect wallet. Accept go. Don't change the network here. Maintain on avalanche Fuji. Okay. So be sure that you are on avalanche Fuji.
00:50:46.390 - 00:51:10.230, Speaker A: Connect wallet on metamask in b shell of this. Now I am in the file set. I'm not over there. It's changed my wallet. I can believe change it. So I come back to Fuji. Now I am on Fuji.
00:51:10.230 - 00:51:46.590, Speaker A: And you can see here that I am on avalanche Fuji with my wallet. And you must do the login with GitHub again and get the tokens. I did this like 1 hour ago. I'm not able to do this again. It. I wait a bit to you to do this. And I'm asking some extra funds in other place.
00:51:46.590 - 00:52:45.104, Speaker A: Wait, is the internal faucet. Here we are. Let's try. Let me wait a bit more for you. Okay. Wait. Let.
00:52:45.104 - 00:53:19.464, Speaker A: I'm lost it here's later. I can't now. Okay. I hope that you get it. If not, you have it using our workshop Faucet. But it's to be not now. Probably I need more time to do this.
00:53:19.464 - 00:53:34.430, Speaker A: Okay. I hope that you have it. Okay. I really appreciate this. But I'm not on this top yet. Wait. Thank you.
00:53:34.430 - 00:54:22.390, Speaker A: So this is the next point. So after you do this, the idea is to add link on Fuji on Metamask. And we must go here specifically. Let's go to the right place. I'm here and Fuji. So use directly this link here. I must do this with you.
00:54:22.390 - 00:55:09.910, Speaker A: Here we are. This is the link token page. And I am directly on Fuji. And I added this to my wallet on metamask. Here we are. Okay, now you can see that I have your vax a bit and a bit of link. Okay, next.
00:55:09.910 - 00:55:26.900, Speaker A: Okay. Let's get my step by step. We are in the found set. We add the Fuji. Okay. Now we are ready to go to remix to create our content. So go to remix.
00:55:26.900 - 00:55:57.870, Speaker A: Oh, my remix is here like always. Let's create. Connect your account. Create everything. Where is this? Where is this? Wow. This is crazy. Here.
00:55:57.870 - 00:56:23.072, Speaker A: Remember that. Go to remix. And now look at this. I am in the boot camp. Icon five. Change it to injected provider. I saw someone asking a long time ago if you can be on the remix VM environment.
00:56:23.072 - 00:56:44.620, Speaker A: No you can't. Why you can't? Because you don't have the chain link services implemented here. So you cannot interact with this. Especially now that scratching. And because I only installed my metamask. Installed again. I must refresh the remix.
00:56:44.620 - 00:57:30.570, Speaker A: So let's go environment injected provider. And now you must be check if you are on custom Giz number network. This is the Fuji network. Okay. Oh, I must find a way to get Fuji for you. Wait, it's not possible that I can do this. I don't know what's happening here.
00:57:30.570 - 00:58:21.512, Speaker A: I found it. Okay, wait a minute. That I may solving this just now. It's maybe until the end of the session. We will get it. Let's tell them where I am now to help. Here we are.
00:58:21.512 - 00:58:58.100, Speaker A: Copy this. Fuji is the hardest. Let's try Fuji. Okay. I just sent a message in internal chat. Let's see if I can get this until the end of our session. Okay, let's write.
00:58:58.100 - 00:59:23.898, Speaker A: Okay, let's create this much content. Understand this much content and see if you can have more Fuji until the end of our session. Okay, this is done. Remember this. You must be on Fuji now. So create now the file. I must change here to the CCIP boot camp.
00:59:23.898 - 00:59:53.206, Speaker A: And I'm going from zero with you. And this is the name of our file. Oh, thank you. Maybe including the quick note has something. Let's try. Thank you Marco. Oh, thank you.
00:59:53.206 - 01:00:23.130, Speaker A: Who is telling Marco? And this is. Let's create CCIP token senderfuji to sepolia soap. And like always begin. And don't cut the code only copy it. I must create this as well. Oh, by the way, if you don't add the extension it will be added in automatically way. So second icon file explorer.
01:00:23.130 - 01:00:52.040, Speaker A: Create a new file name and automatically. I have saw here I'm copying from another place. Let's see if I may have problems if you wait. It's good. But I prefer to use the version that I tried before. So this is my contract. It's green.
01:00:52.040 - 01:01:09.150, Speaker A: It's okay. I can send to you. This is the contract and you are copying and paste now. And I'm here explaining our concept to you. It's a long explanation. I'm talking a lot today. Wow.
01:01:09.150 - 01:02:13.540, Speaker A: So if you can help your friend, let's do in this way to organize you guys boys and girls, come here. Do you need bookings? Add here your name, address, what do you need? And then who needs token? Add your information here. If you have more tokens that you can share now, please send it to someone and put your name on the side to tell them that. Okay, I sent to you. Let's try to help our friends. Marco, I need your address. I'm doing this.
01:02:13.540 - 01:02:57.380, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm putting my name here because I'm doing Nimna. And for today we must have one link and 0.1 Avax. This is what you need today. Okay, so Nimna, are you saying this for you? Oh, there are a guy telling me that he can help me. Wait a bit more. We will have our topics live.
01:02:57.380 - 01:04:16.832, Speaker A: So I'm sending link to Nimna, I'm sending five v links to you see I needed to change the compiler. Yes, you can see that I'm using the version 90 team today. In fact it's supposed to work on 21, but I didn't test it and I prefer to not test this life. So I may guarantee my part on the video doing on the 90 team. If you'd like to test the order, you can test it, but let's be sure that this is working, okay? And I know that there are a guy sending tokens to me now. When I have the tokens, then I can help you send it to our workshop faucet. Okay? And by the way, I will explain everything that you have here.
01:04:16.832 - 01:05:10.100, Speaker A: Meanwhile, like I said before, DJ, I created this content in this version and I didn't test it in the new one. I think it's working, but I will not do this change live now. Okay? It's only to be sure that everything is working. So if you have here the out compile automatically, you have the zero 819. If not, you must change in a manually way. And Sylvia, be sure that you have your content opened and refresh everything. Maybe you have your own remix.
01:05:10.100 - 01:05:56.032, Speaker A: So let's understand our content. I'm importing the interface of the outer. Remember that we talked about interfaces yesterday? So using this interface I have the definition of all the functions in the outer, but not the implementation, because I like to interact with the outer. Oh, it seems that I have tokens. Yes, look at these guys. I'm so rich now and I can share this with you. Now let's get our faucet.
01:05:56.032 - 01:06:38.432, Speaker A: And you can get in our faucet now it. And wait a minute, because I must say thank you for him. And I'm live now. You know this toddler I may say thank you for you live because you save me now. Thank you and let's go forward. And here we are. I'm sending here and then you can get in our official faucet here.
01:06:38.432 - 01:07:17.154, Speaker A: Okay, so use this. I'm adding here. I'm adding here. And now I think you are good to get this. And by the way, here is the faucet. I think you already have the password because the password is used only here. If not, are you adding the beginning of the pet? But don't tell anyone this password.
01:07:17.154 - 01:07:51.200, Speaker A: Okay? It's only to us and I must send something to you. Wait, let's get this. And I'm sending a bit per time. Okay, so let's send this now it's for people. For 60 people. Now sending a vax. Let's send the link as well.
01:07:51.200 - 01:08:42.390, Speaker A: This amount of link for now. I think it's good. Okay, confirm it. The one confirming the order. Okay, digital you can access later. Here we are. Yoohoo.
01:08:42.390 - 01:09:25.670, Speaker A: We are rich now and let's come back. I have a lot of things to talk here waiting. So we talk about the how we are interacting with the how to. Another important point for you is the client. So the client is the chaining service that you are using. So you must import the client on your contract. Also you can see here that I'm importing the interface of an ERC 20 token.
01:09:25.670 - 01:10:15.510, Speaker A: In fact, I don't need all the functions that we have on this interface, but I need some of them. Let's import this. And I'm importing the link token interface because the link token, it's compatible with ERC 20 token, but it's a different token, it's a special token. So let's get exactly the interface of link. This is my content here. I'm defining the interfaces like I have the outer, I have the link token and I'm creating the owner in the way that we are creating until now. And here I define the address of the link token that I'm using.
01:10:15.510 - 01:10:58.482, Speaker A: This address must be the same that you have here. And it came from the same link that we saw a few minutes ago. Here, this is the address that we are using. Next, I defined the howter address where I got the howter address and I prefer to share all of this with you. Oh, by the way, this is so cute. You help each other and make everything learn together. Guys, I'm so proud of you.
01:10:58.482 - 01:11:47.150, Speaker A: Really proud. It's really amazing. So this is where I got the Fuji. The next that I must send to you. Is this here and here you can see all the networks that CCIP is supporting now. And we just launched the new version of CCIP one 20 including all my contest that I had in the previous version is not working. I'm like doing everything again and testing.
01:11:47.150 - 01:12:21.370, Speaker A: I was doing this today and here we are. We have the Fuji testnet. This is the outer that I'm using and including I expand Fuji. I need to test something because I just ask them to fix something. Yes, great. And now you can see that I have the address of the BNM tokens. This is the Burn and mint token.
01:12:21.370 - 01:12:59.030, Speaker A: This is provided by Chinglink to us to test to use cCap. Where I got this address. Let's see here in supported test networks. If I scroll down, I'm going from Fuji to Sepolia and I'm using the CCIP burning mint tokens. In fact, the token itself is the same on the surface. So if I came to Mumbai, it's the same CCAp burning. But for some of them I have an extra token to test it.
01:12:59.030 - 01:13:19.120, Speaker A: Wow. You can test USDC. I will do another workshop with you. I like it. But let's focus on Fuji now. Okay, here we are. This is the address of the token that we are using.
01:13:19.120 - 01:13:45.240, Speaker A: Then I must get some information for sepolia. I must get the destination chain selector where I'm going. I'm sending to Sepolia. Come back here to the supported networks. Now go to Sepolia. Let's expand sepolia. And this is the change selector that I'm using.
01:13:45.240 - 01:14:08.338, Speaker A: Here we are. If you need more, let me know. Okay, it's good. But if you need more, let me know that I can add more here. And here we are. The destination chain selector. Now I have something.
01:14:08.338 - 01:14:49.810, Speaker A: I'm erangling some air. So this is new for you. When we are working with solidity that in the same way that I can emit an event, I can create an ahor and say what is the ahor? So on the ahor I must pass the balance the fees on this point. Or I can have the ahor, nothing to withdraw. You understand this later. This is the token event. So when my token was transferred, this is the message that you will have this event with the message id.
01:14:49.810 - 01:15:39.550, Speaker A: The destination chain selector, the receiver, the token, the amount, how you are paying the fee and the amount of fees. And Simona BNM is burn and mint. And Lenn is lock and mint. Okay, so B and M burn and mint. And the other lock and mint. You have this in the presentation here you have the tokens, okay? Lock and mint. Burning mint.
01:15:39.550 - 01:16:21.114, Speaker A: And the tokens are here. Now we have the constructor. Remember that the constructor is colored only when we are deploying the smart contract. So we are like defining everything, the owner, the outer with the client, the link with the interface of the link, the interface of the outer. And this is important. I'm using this, I'm paying the fees using link, the outer. You get this link, you pay these fees on link, on the destination chain.
01:16:21.114 - 01:17:09.764, Speaker A: So in order to the outer to get the fees, I must approve the outer to transfer the fees from my account to the outer. Okay? And this is the main function that we have it transferred to sepolia. So when I need transferring. By the way, I had it coded. Everything okay? You saw that I had it coded out of this. If I go to the documentation doc and guide transfer tokens here you have your contact like this. But they are not hard coded.
01:17:09.764 - 01:17:54.488, Speaker A: You can write it now like life. But doing in a hard code way is easy to especially the beginners to not make some mistake and come back here. The transfer to Sepolia. We must define the address of receiver. This will be an external account, your account and the amount that we'd like to receive. And here with the client, the client has some structures defined, some special types defined. One is the evme token amount.
01:17:54.488 - 01:18:36.324, Speaker A: So this is an array. And on this kind of type I must say the address of the token and the amount. In our case we are using the BNM token and the amount that we would like to transfer. Then we are building the CCIP message. And this is another special type defined on the chainlink client. The CCIP client, like talking about types. You have the string, you have the address type.
01:18:36.324 - 01:19:02.990, Speaker A: You can have custom types. These are custom types used by the CCAP. So we have this type EVM to any message and we must have this information. The receiver. We have the ABI encode of the receiver. This is a hash of the receiver. We are not sending any data, any information.
01:19:02.990 - 01:19:35.540, Speaker A: We are only sending tokens. And by the way, you can send more than one token in the same message. You can send up to five tokens. But now we are sending only one, the position zero of our list. Extra arguments. You can increase the gas limit. For example, next week when we are doing this with nfts, I must put the gas limit in the maximum.
01:19:35.540 - 01:20:11.068, Speaker A: But for now we don't care about this. Maintain the gas limit on zero. This is the default. And how can I pay the fee? Like I said before, you can pay using the nativity token. Using the link token, we are paying the fees using the link token. Here we have the fees management. So I have the fees.
01:20:11.068 - 01:21:05.408, Speaker A: Here the outer you calculate the fee because it depends of the destination chain, the fee can be more or less expensive. For example, to go to Ethereum is more expensive than to go to polygon. And so I specify the destination chain selector, my message and how to calculate the fees. Here I'm checking if the balance of my content on link is greater than what I need to pay the fees. It means that before sending the transaction we are sending link to our smart content. Okay, if not, we refer to this messaging. After this we approve the outer with the fees.
01:21:05.408 - 01:22:11.610, Speaker A: I'm not sure if I needed this because I already have approved the maximum here, but okay, you maintain both and this I must approve it for sure. Now I must approve the outer to send the burning mint tokens that you like to send. And this is a concept of ERc 20 tokens that we didn't talk about. When you send tokens from your wallet, you are transferring tokens. But if you transfer tokens to a smart concept, the smart contract cannot know that he receive a token. It's not like it that we did yesterday. So the approach when we are using ERC 20 tokens is the approve and transfer from and this is the point I'm approving the outer to after transfer from my account the tokens that I need.
01:22:11.610 - 01:23:32.530, Speaker A: Okay, and this is so I have the address of the burna meet token and approving the outer to transfer this amount from my account. In this case from Jesus match content to the how to use it. And this is the message I mean using the how to use the cCAP sync to the destination chain, the messaging the message is transfer burning mint tokens. And here I am emitting the event that the token was transferred. Remember that I have the same emojifier only owner, you already know it. And I create a function here to withdraw tokens because I'm sending burning mint and I'm sending link to disconnect after deploy it. So if I'd like to withdraw this later, I can specify the token who you receive, but only the owner can do this.
01:23:32.530 - 01:24:12.320, Speaker A: The smart contract is done. We are ready to deploy it. Let's go. So deploy. Remember, be sure that you are on Avax Fuji deploy and add here your name and contract address. Let's go. Good luck to us.
01:24:12.320 - 01:25:06.610, Speaker A: Deploy. What I did wrong? I did something wrong and I must understand what is this? Look, this guys, I am a beginner like you. Really? I forgot to change my environment, so I'm not connected on the blockchain. Yes summer, you are right. I am on the wrong environment, so let's connect with my wallet. Yes, now I'm right. Perfect.
01:25:06.610 - 01:25:51.410, Speaker A: Yes, let's do it. By the way, confirm. Sometimes remix is like locked after this kind of a hole. And I must refresh everything. Not now. Perfect. This is the address of mine and let's try to put this here a bit more for you.
01:25:51.410 - 01:26:36.840, Speaker A: Why? Mohammed, a tip for you. Be sure that you have the dot saw in lowercase, not uppercase. Okay? Be sure that you have the auto compile selected here on the icon four. If not, compile it manually. Okay? Yes, it is perfect. Thank you. Kiss.
01:26:36.840 - 01:27:52.550, Speaker A: And here we are, we have our token deployed. I wait a bit more to you. Let's waiting. Yeah, I think we are good. Let's wait one more if you need more. Okay, Alex, I'm not sure. No, it's not this.
01:27:52.550 - 01:29:00.320, Speaker A: I'm not sure if you are talking about here, like I have the contact here, but related to the transaction. Like if you go to the metamask, you can see that my last transaction was a contact deployment. And I can see on block Explorer and this is the testnet node race, this is the Fuji block explorer, okay. And yes, this is the answer I'm adding undivided here. Add your contacts upstairs. This is the block explorer. Yes, here we are.
01:29:00.320 - 01:29:59.352, Speaker A: So I think you are good. Now, are you continuing our workshop? What we must do now, we must get tokens. First of all, let's get some burn and mint CCIt. Burn and mint token. How can I do this? Let's go here, these are the CCIP test tokens on the documentation acquired test tokens. And I came directly to the mint part. Let's open again because I'm in a wrong place now.
01:29:59.352 - 01:30:44.756, Speaker A: Here you can mint tokens directly inside the documentation. So I'm connecting my wallet now. And here I will do both. First, add the CCAP burning mint to my wallet. And I already have something I was testing before, like this is my main testnet wallet and let's mint one burn mint token. I'm not sure if I can mint this now because I minted before. I think I was in another wallet.
01:30:44.756 - 01:31:27.230, Speaker A: Let's see. But this is the process. Connect wallet on Fuji. Add the burning mint token to your wallet. Mint one, you cannot choose another amount. Okay, this is the maximum that you can have. Now we must fund our smart contract and someone translated this.
01:31:27.230 - 01:31:50.150, Speaker A: How can we fund we're going to metamask. Send it to our contact. One link and 0.1 CCIP burnaming. Let's get the address of my contact. This is my contact. Let's go.
01:31:50.150 - 01:32:40.438, Speaker A: Go to tokens. Select link Saint to my contract. One link. Now I'm doing the same with the burning tokens. Burning mint Saint to my smart contract 0.1 and Lucas. Exactly.
01:32:40.438 - 01:33:22.330, Speaker A: Make sure you are on Avax Fuji here. Okay, thank you, Lucas. Now my contact is ready to send the transaction. It's time to do the cross chain transfer. You are running the transfer to Sepolia and the receiver. Your wallet. Your address.
01:33:22.330 - 01:33:54.210, Speaker A: Wallet. The amount. Let's. The amount will be. Let's send zero point, 110 percent burn and mint. So we need the chin conveys. This will be on weight.
01:33:54.210 - 01:34:31.550, Speaker A: This amount of weight. So the amount is this. We are ready. Thank you, Chris. I think I'm finding the way to be in a better way to our few. I'm so proud of you. Thank you for your feedback.
01:34:31.550 - 01:34:59.456, Speaker A: Time to go. Let's do it. Expand the transfer to Sepolia to be easy for you. Address my wallet amount. Let's copy from here. Yes, Simona. Let's see if I did something wrong.
01:34:59.456 - 01:35:33.580, Speaker A: Yes, I sent it to the content. I sent to the content 0.1. But if I'd like to do more transfers, it's better to send a small amount to the other side. So I'm sending only this. Only 10% to the sepolia. Yes, this is right. And this is my transaction.
01:35:33.580 - 01:36:09.836, Speaker A: Lindsay, to get your contact address. Are you talking about your contact here? Because this is the address that I must send. This is my contact. Okay. This is my smart contract. Let's be. I made this fund your concert.
01:36:09.836 - 01:36:39.810, Speaker A: Okay. Send to your concrete address. Is that that you added here on this list. Okay, perfect. Yeah, great idea, Lucas. Because I have this on my list. But I jump it.
01:36:39.810 - 01:37:17.580, Speaker A: So before using this, let's be sure that we have the talkings. This is on my notes. Check the balances. How can we check the balances? I'm going directly to the link token on the explorer. This is the content. And if I go to concert. I used to read this concert.
01:37:17.580 - 01:37:57.790, Speaker A: Yes. What happened? What's happened with them that you cannot see this anymore? Wow. Broke my heart. Let's see if it's the same with the other rate. Oh, this is good. Okay, I will fix this in another way. Wait, not for now.
01:37:57.790 - 01:38:30.150, Speaker A: But I must tell them to fix this. Okay, let's check only the burning mint now and not do the other part now. Okay. By the way, take this off for you. It's not working. This is working. It.
01:38:30.150 - 01:39:00.752, Speaker A: This is only to me. Okay, so if I'm here directly, I am on the block explorer of the Fuji. This is the address of the burning Inc. Token. And because the content is verified, I can read the content. So if I go to balance off, for example, I can see my balance. Let's get mine.
01:39:00.752 - 01:39:28.110, Speaker A: This is my account. I have 6.918. I should find it here. Yes, I have it. Let's get our contact. So get the contact address and check here. Yes, this is the amount that I sent.
01:39:28.110 - 01:40:10.640, Speaker A: Okay, is this. So I think we are right now cross fingers. Let's see if this is working. Transact. So I'm confirming the transaction metamask now. Now I'd like to get something for you. Maybe.
01:40:10.640 - 01:40:54.430, Speaker A: Yes, this is a good way. Now I ask you to put here your name and the transaction id of the transfer to seporia. Because we are using this. Okay, so how can I get my transaction id? Go to metamask. This is the contact interaction. I can copy the transaction id here. I know that's hard to see, but copy transaction id.
01:40:54.430 - 01:41:46.320, Speaker A: Wait. Kyo, you are so fast. Must wait us. And now we are going to the CCIT explorer. I don't need this now. Here from zero CCIP Chain link. We are going here CCIP chain link and paste the address of your transaction here on the CCIP explorer.
01:41:46.320 - 01:42:13.900, Speaker A: Augustine solidity didn't know commas or dots. You must add this in the way that I did. Look how I did it. It's in way. You cannot put dot here. Okay. And on the CCAP explorer I use search my transaction.
01:42:13.900 - 01:42:36.460, Speaker A: And here we are. My transaction is on the explorer. I'd like to do something so fast before. Guys, wait a minute. I must create a new account and get my account. Go to one. Go to Sepolia.
01:42:36.460 - 01:43:18.330, Speaker A: I do not have time to do so. Let's go do all the process with you in a peaceful way. What I'm doing now, after this, let's add some divider here. And you are going to the CCAP explorer. Find your transaction. Until the transaction is finalized, it used to be four minutes from Fuji to Sepolia. If I am for example, the opposite from Sepolia to Fuji is like 20 minutes.
01:43:18.330 - 01:44:10.556, Speaker A: Because of the finality. Remember that we need to have different times depends of the network to be sure that your transaction is confirmed. This is the point. Now, on metamask, select Sepolia and add not. It is not. Yes, here on Sepolia, add the burning means token. Okay, let's do this.
01:44:10.556 - 01:44:40.020, Speaker A: I must do this from zero. Let's see. My transaction is still blessed. I'd like to wait with me. I'd like to see when this is finished. Simona, probably your problem is that probably you didn't send one link and 0.1 burning mint tokens to your contract.
01:44:40.020 - 01:45:06.590, Speaker A: Be sure that you did this. Yes. Success. It means that my 0.1 is on Sepolia. Now. Let's get it.
01:45:06.590 - 01:45:28.070, Speaker A: And I have more. Okay, so probably you have only 0.1. I know that I have more. So on metamask now I may go into Sepolia here. Then. Look here. I'm going to the testnet tokens again.
01:45:28.070 - 01:45:58.250, Speaker A: And I am on Sepolia, add the burning mint to Sepolia. And it seems that it's right. Look at this, guys. I have 0.1 ccp burns token on Sepolia. And it came from Fuji. This is really amazing.
01:45:58.250 - 01:46:26.672, Speaker A: For the people that need this. What you must do, go to. Let's bring more space here. You must send it to your concrete. Jeez, how can we do this on Sepolia? I'm not osepolia now. Okay, let's go. No osepolia, no.
01:46:26.672 - 01:46:53.636, Speaker A: Sorry. On Fuji, you must copy your contact address. And on metamask, select the token link sent to your contact. One link. I'm not doing this now. Okay, do the same with CCIP. Burning mint.
01:46:53.636 - 01:47:24.810, Speaker A: Send to your contact address 0.1 burning mint. Okay, I'm not doing this now. I'd like to come back to Sepolia and to enjoy my burning mints token. It's over there. And. Yes.
01:47:24.810 - 01:47:57.378, Speaker A: Amazing, John, amazing. Caillou, I think you were confusing a bit. No? If you try to see here in the activity here on Sepolia. No, because you didn't do this transaction. The outer did for you. You can find this on the outer. On the CCAP outer.
01:47:57.378 - 01:49:00.220, Speaker A: So on the explorer, I can see the destination transaction hash. So this is the hash of the transaction that was sent to me. The outer gdgs, not me. So if you are happy with your cross chain transfer token, you can sharing the network that you did it. Chain link bootcamp 24. My first crossing token transfer, something like that. You can share this on the social networks.
01:49:00.220 - 01:49:48.440, Speaker A: And also remember that you can add us if you'd like to tag me. This is my twitter as well. Okay. And here we are. I think my friends are not here today. Javier was with me in some moment, but he's not now Jeff, are you able to appear or no? I think not. No problem.
01:49:48.440 - 01:50:20.900, Speaker A: This session is totally mine for today. So I may wait a bit more. Only to solve some dubs with you and let's answer some questions. Wait, Augustine, you will have it. Wait a bit more, guys. By the way, when I'm doing a workshop like this, this is the best to test any system. Because we are doing like 100 transactions together.
01:50:20.900 - 01:51:09.380, Speaker A: We may make any system crazy ache. Can we send other tokens? The token to be sent on this way using managed by chaining must be supported by us. So how can we see this? Remember that where is the supported here on the supported networks we can see for example, which lane. Which token do you have? We have. So here for example, we have. From Sepalia to Fuji we have the same. But if I try to go for example from.
01:51:09.380 - 01:51:43.056, Speaker A: I'd like to go from Sepolia. But from Sepolia to Mumbai you can see that I have exactly the same. I saw something different over there. What I did that. I see order. I need to check again. I think I was in order because we are launching new tokens.
01:51:43.056 - 01:52:13.996, Speaker A: But the token must be like we feel. Let's share my screen a bit. So I'm here on the supported networks. And here we can see the tokens in different chains. Depends of the network that we have. You have different tokens to share? Depends of the lane. For now you can use these two tokens.
01:52:13.996 - 01:52:42.250, Speaker A: The burning mint and lock and mint Philippine. No, it's not this. Where it was philippine. No, you can't rename it. This is our token. We created this. We are waiting because we are awaiting the finality of the blockchain.
01:52:42.250 - 01:53:10.542, Speaker A: This is not related to heavy one burning mint token. We must allow you to burn only one burning mint. Because we have had a lot of people testing. It's only this for now. And sometimes can be when we must wait more is not because of CCap. But this is the pains of the network. In some moments the network is busy.
01:53:10.542 - 01:53:35.794, Speaker A: So we must wait more. This is normal. Pernian, you can get the link now. Don't worry about it. Did you enter our workshop faucet? Okay, I'm adding here for you. Get on the faucet. Okay, go to the faucet.
01:53:35.794 - 01:54:16.660, Speaker A: Let's send a bit more for you. Not on Sepolia. We need link. So let's send some links. This is the address that I must send. And tokens link sent. Iu sent for ten people now and sending some Avax as well.
01:54:16.660 - 01:54:49.374, Speaker A: Send a vax. Okay, so you can get your tokens now in a few minutes. Okay, let's see. Yes, I was saying to mint the token in this kind of token to test. We call it drip. The drip function. Yeah.
01:54:49.374 - 01:55:30.504, Speaker A: If you go to this no trace, you can mint over there using this. And thank you. I'm so glad that all of you made it. And now let's share my screen again, which mark shopping is. Sorry, I can talk with Portuguese with him. You know that I'm doing this in three languages. In English, now in Portuguese, 06:00 p.m.
01:55:30.504 - 01:55:46.030, Speaker A: For me, 630. And in Spanish 09:00 p.m. So these two weeks I'm doing this until 11:00 p.m. For me. But I like it. I choose to do this. Okay, I think it's this.
01:55:46.030 - 01:56:08.004, Speaker A: We are so good for today. Congrats everyone. You did your first cross chain transfer token. I'm so proud of all of you. Remember that if you not code this, live with me now. Don't worry about it. You have the hacker, you have the video.
01:56:08.004 - 01:56:56.724, Speaker A: Come back to the YouTube, try later, stop, add some pause, do in another way, try to do it. I'm sure that you can do it. And if you have some dubs, go to our discord. We have people helping over there. And tomorrow will be the day to you to have everyone together. Okay? So tomorrow Hisshet will be here with you, also with Lucas and probably other developers, experts as well and some community advocates as well. But they will be here live like me here on the stage answering your questions.
01:56:56.724 - 01:57:38.930, Speaker A: Okay? And this is hope that you have a great day tomorrow and see you next Monday. You'll be here next Monday. And next Monday we are creating our first NFT. You needed a discord address. Wait, I can add for you, but it's in another presentation. Look at if you have it easy than me it. Here we are, discord for you.
01:57:38.930 - 01:57:56.600, Speaker A: Okay, are you adding the beginning of the chat as well if you need it. And bye.
