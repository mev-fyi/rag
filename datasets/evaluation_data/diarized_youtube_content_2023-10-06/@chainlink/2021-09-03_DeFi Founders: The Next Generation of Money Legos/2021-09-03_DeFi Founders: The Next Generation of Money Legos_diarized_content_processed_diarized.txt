00:00:05.450 - 00:00:27.510, Speaker A: Hi everyone, I'm Zaji Reyes. I'm part of the ecosystem team here at Chainlink Labs and I'm stoked to talk about money legos. So I'll go ahead and have each of our panelists please introduce themselves. Talk about a little bit about how your project is taking advantage of composability and chainlinks play and role within your project's functionality. So let's go ahead and start with Guillaume.
00:00:28.890 - 00:00:47.050, Speaker B: Hey everyone, thanks for having me. So I'm the co founder of ATMPh. We are offering fixed rate yield on stablecoin and crypto on ethereum and we are leveraging chain link technology with the keeper to update our on chain interest rate oracles.
00:00:49.970 - 00:00:50.718, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:00:50.884 - 00:01:55.140, Speaker C: Jae Yoon yes, my name is Jae yoon and I'm a CEO of Spokelog in South Korea and mainly we are building a main net but we're also making some of the Defi projects and one of the Defi project is named Cushion Finance. And Cushion Finance is a synthetic asset protocol that provides people with opportunities to hedge or speculate of kimchi premium in Korea. And to implement it we use Chainix Oracle to get two price fees. One is the exchange rate of korean one and bitcoin, and one is the exchange rate of korean one and us dollar. And as a result we can mint two assets for korean one and make a marketplace for people to exchange those identical assets with different prices. People can bet for kimchi Premium by buying or selling those korean ones. Thank you.
00:01:55.990 - 00:02:00.260, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for explaining that. We'll go ahead and go with James as well.
00:02:02.550 - 00:02:56.950, Speaker D: Hey everyone, this is James Song, head of business development at Fletta and we are a mainet platform and we launched our main net in 2019 and we have worked on mainly to make more use cases in our ecosystem. One of the key ecosystem partner would be Defi partners. So we have launched a Defi service called Flettaconnect and we are using a chain link oracle to make sure that we are giving out the rewards based on the right data, not only just focusing on centralized data, and also we do have cross chain technology to interact with other platforms. So we have launched on BSSE but we'll soon be launching on Polygon and at the end we'll be launching our own mainnet based AMM decks as well. So more roadmaps are coming. So yeah, stay tuned.
00:02:58.250 - 00:03:03.960, Speaker A: Let's definitely dive into some cross chain chat in a bit. Betty, Akala, we'd love to hear more.
00:03:05.850 - 00:03:59.238, Speaker E: Yeah, thanks for having me here. This is Betty, co founder from Akala. So we are a specialized defi blockchain built on top of Polkadot with EVM compatibility. And with specialization we have primitive that's built on top of the platform with stablecoin, various different type of decks and also liquid staking. So that's a new thing on this platform. And then we have multiple cross chain assets with ease, BTC Erc 20, but also new asset classes like Dot and liquid dot with ute bearing offering to developers and dapps built on top of us. So when we integrate with Chainlink there are excitements like new innovations that we bring in for Changlink users.
00:03:59.238 - 00:04:28.740, Speaker E: So for example we have quality of service for chingling price feed. So when chingling feeds into our network it is system transaction. So you will never get into a situation of network congestion and you cannot read the latest price fee so that's not possible on our network. And then another thing is we customize our fee structure so transaction fees if you really want can be paid in link token. So I'll stop there but I'm sure we're going to discuss more later on.
00:04:29.510 - 00:04:36.680, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's a great hint at what's to come and really interesting all of the work that you're doing. And Mike, let's hear from you as well.
00:04:37.370 - 00:05:32.078, Speaker F: Hello guys, my name is Yemen and you can call me Mike. And I'm one of the co founders of SoF protocol. And SOF protocol is solely about financial and nfts. So in soap protocols you can actually create and mint and exchange financial and NFTs. I used to be a software developer so compatibility is not a new thing to me. We use things like software component or web services or restful APIs for more than a decade. But I think composability means much more in Defi because take an example of solve in our protocol.
00:05:32.078 - 00:06:30.700, Speaker F: Actually you can enclose arbitrary amount of tokens into a financial NFT. We close voucher and you can enclose those assets in a voucher and then you can trade it, you can use it as collateral to borrow money. So in this scenario you can imagine that it's very crucial for us to have the right and updated and the accurate price. So if failing that we can easily lose money, lose users asset. So it's crucial to us. So that's where we do not want to develop oracle ourselves. So we use chainlink as the price oracles like other protocols to guarantee our prices are right.
00:06:30.700 - 00:07:06.630, Speaker F: And also likewise we are also planning to use chainlink keepers to automate our smart contract. But in fact financial nfts are just tokenized smart contracts. So yes, composibilities means money means life to divide protocols. So it's much more than something we used to use in, in software.
00:07:09.130 - 00:07:36.640, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a huge impact there and it affects more than just the basics. Right? So we'll definitely talk about that before we get into anything else. I think it'd be also cool just to chat with each project a little bit more about specifics of what you're doing within money legos, how you're improving Defi. So I'd love to start with Guillaume. I know that a big part of building money Legos is including incentives for users and really tying in your users. How is ADA MPH doing this?
00:07:38.770 - 00:08:15.142, Speaker B: That's a really good question. At APH, we see the composability and the money legal concept as really a necessity. We can't exist without that composability, so we need it. It's like mimicking the nature where nothing can live isolated. We need to connect things together to make things work correctly. So it's exactly the same for us, at least in the Defi ecosystem. We are evolving in in our netherroom.
00:08:15.142 - 00:09:21.214, Speaker B: We need each other and the way we like to answer your questions regarding incentives, we are distributing incentives with our native token, the Mph token, on 88 mph platform. But at the same time we are able to harvest, if I can say like that, some governance token from other protocol like Ave compound the underlying protocol we are using and we are redistributing this value harvested to our end users. So at the end of the day, we are kind of redistributing 100% of a protocol revenue to our users. And yeah, like having kind of socializing the protocol revenue, socializing the governance power into the end of our mph orders. So that's also a good illustration of what you can do with composability at the end. You can really create an ecosystem of value shared between the platform and the end users. And it's like that.
00:09:21.214 - 00:09:22.798, Speaker B: You create a great community.
00:09:22.884 - 00:09:30.580, Speaker A: I suppose you can't really have one without the other. So I think 88 mph is a great example of how that's happening.
00:09:31.110 - 00:09:31.522, Speaker E: Cool.
00:09:31.576 - 00:09:42.440, Speaker A: Jay Yoon I know that you were talking a little bit about how oracles expand money Legos. What assets is superblock building on top of all this to expand the Defi money Lego system?
00:09:43.450 - 00:10:58.830, Speaker C: Yes, Superblock is making Kusha finance, and Kusha finance is a platform for betting for the kinship premium. And kinship premium is a special opportunity only in Korea. But those premiums on the assets will be increasing if the DeFi is developed, if DeFi is improving, and oracles can bring the prices of the assets outside of the blockchain. And for example, mirror DeFi project in terra brings the prices of stocks in America. So anyone in the world, including China or other countries, can trade us stocks anywhere and anytime. So other DeFi projects, like syndics, means many assets, including currencies, oil prices, or other assets in other blockchains and something else. So this feature will extend the DeFi money vehicles, and people can mint and trade for any of the assets in the world, and people can trade for many assets not in the real world.
00:10:58.830 - 00:11:26.520, Speaker C: So this point will make and improve the money levels of the DeFi. And the oracle is a very important part of these DeFi money and supercloud also make those assets, and we think there will be many of the opportunities to make those assets. And kimchi Premium is the first of our product.
00:11:28.490 - 00:11:47.520, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. And you're really entering the international and metaverse stage there. So it's exciting stuff. James, let's talk a little bit about cross chain. And I also know that Fletta is a blockchain mainnet and has launched a yield farming defi platform called Fletta Connect. Let's talk about that. How is it different? What's it doing?
00:11:47.970 - 00:12:27.210, Speaker D: Yes, so, first we developed our main net because we felt that there is a needs of users and apps with higher performance, with interoperability. So we have launched a main net with fast speed, with 7000 tps. But as you mentioned, cross chain technology. So interoperating with Ethereum or other chains became more important than it was before. So we have developed technological gateway. So it's convertible between Ethereum chain. Now it's with Tomo chain and Binancemart chain and Polygon.
00:12:27.210 - 00:13:35.040, Speaker D: That's how we secure the crosschain with our gateway, so that Ethereum, dapps or other Dapps can still stay in Ethereum, but can enjoy the higher performance of. Yeah, and we wanted to bring more traffic into our platform, so that's why we launched our own Defi. There are a lot of anonymous projects, but we wanted to build a trust and prove that there can be roadmaps made, actually made in defi section. So we have launched on BSC, we'll be integrating on separate main nets, such as Polygon and more. And then our main goal would be bringing more users into our platform, running our own AMM decks, and to make sure that our platform is sustainable with more users and more traffic. So, yeah, we do have that roadmap and also we'll be utilizing nfts into our DeFi project as well. So it'll be interesting to see farming while you own the.
00:13:35.040 - 00:13:38.270, Speaker D: So interesting concept.
00:13:39.490 - 00:13:55.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely want to try that out. That is a concept that I think is new and really interesting and it kind of brings us to the NFT topic. So Mike, what are financial nfts? You did touch on it a little bit, but I'd love to hear more about what they are and what you're doing to make things different in the space.
00:13:56.170 - 00:14:49.222, Speaker F: Sure. Currently, the best known financial nfts might be the uniswap v three LP NFT. But actually financial NFT is much more abstract concept. To learn what it is, we first need to look very carefully what ERC 721 NFT is. And it's actually, if you watch the specification, the standard code, and you can see that it's actually in a container. It's a unique container labeled by its smart contract, the address of its smart contract, and the token id. So when you say NFT art, you are actually referring to something to some container which.
00:14:49.222 - 00:15:38.230, Speaker F: Containing an artwork. With that in mind, I should say that what if we. Let's imagine what if we put financial instrument, financial asset, or amount of tokens into that container? Okay. In that way, we got financial nfTs. It's actually financial Navy can be regarded as encapsulation of both financial asset and a piece of code to control that financial asset. So you can actually use that piece of code to control the inflow and outflow of that asset. So in that way, we got something we call financial NFT.
00:15:38.230 - 00:16:34.120, Speaker F: So as I just said, it's tokenized smart contract. It's tokenized financial contracts. It's implementation of decentralized financial instruments. So you can see that in that way, a financial NFT itself is a building block of money Legos. It's the blocks of the Legos. Right? So in that way, we believe that the financial NFTs can strongly, can significantly upgrade the money Legos in DFI. And solve is dedicated to that, to that vision solve protocol, actually create a new token standard.
00:16:34.120 - 00:17:16.310, Speaker F: It's ERC 721 compatible, but it's much more powerful than that we created to support financial NFT. Specifically. Specifically. So we support the fractionalization, the merging and splitting of NFT. We believe that this is the right way. The project has been launched on Ethereum and BSc. So we urge you to try it out on our website, soap finance.
00:17:16.310 - 00:17:34.894, Speaker F: Needlessly to say, as I just mentioned, Chanlink plays a vital role in this new universe of Legos. Not only the price oracles, but also keepers. Yeah, thank you.
00:17:35.012 - 00:17:53.860, Speaker A: Yeah, no, definitely. You're really chatting about how this all ties together and this is really the value of this panel. Right, Betty? Also Karura, a call is candle. Your network has recently launched on Mainnet. It's DeFi specialized chain on Kusama and Polkadot. How did the launch go and what do we need to know about it?
00:17:54.870 - 00:18:31.002, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. I think probably start with our know. At Akala, our goal is actually to democratize finance for everyone on the planet. To achieve that goal though, we chose to actually build on top of Polkadot, which is the Internet of blockchain, which is like TCP IP. And we are the specialized or optimized blockchain for decentralized finance on that Internet of blockchain. So on Akala, we serve a wide range of audience. We serve ogs, djans, dev developers, protocols like compound.
00:18:31.002 - 00:19:32.910, Speaker E: We're building a cross chain bridge to the multi chain money market. But we're also collaborating with fintech and institutions such as current is our collaborator, so we can serve mass market through this type of collaboration. The reason I mentioned all of those background is because in order to reach that much scale and also compliance and also serve the mass market in various different industry, we need security, we need high level of compliance. So in the Polkadot world, we have this concept of a low value canary network. So this is like where Kusama's position is, is the canary network of Polka Dot. So Polka Dot currently is top ten in the list and Kusama is almost top 50 as a low value canary network for Polka Dot. So we can actually test all of the concepts, all of the financial sort of incentives, economics, governance on this canary network.
00:19:32.910 - 00:20:18.450, Speaker E: So we just launched our canary network, Akala's canary network called Karura. So only about ten days ago. So on launch we've already through the mechanism that we secured the network was about 500,000 ksm. So that's about 100 mil at current market cap and then about yesterday. So within 3 hours we've had a TbL of like 20 plus million been locked on the decks and also stablecoin. So this is a tremendous growth in this new sort of environment because I guess for existing players, this is a new marketplace. There's new asset classes.
00:20:18.450 - 00:21:02.606, Speaker E: Apart from Kusama and Polkadot, there are a hundred other sort of parachains about to launch. So there are many, many asset class there for folks to actually play around and also new market as. So that's how we as the defi center, or hub if you like, as a lending pad for other people to come and build. There's a liquidity center that we connect to other blockchains like bitcoin, Ethereum, maybe Selena and other chains as well. We bring the liquidity together and also for dapps to build on top of it. And that's why folks like Changlink and others can actually really help bootstrap, helping developers to get to that next. Yeah, so that's us.
00:21:02.788 - 00:21:27.880, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a united effort and it's really exciting. So congrats on that. And you also touched a little bit on bringing in ogs, degens, each of us and each project here is really focused on that. Total value locked on chain has grown exponentially in the past year. Anyone can jump in and answer this, but how are you building for that? How are you handling growth? We only have a few minutes left, so if anybody has thoughts on this.
00:21:33.130 - 00:22:08.660, Speaker B: I think the best way of doing that is composability, making sure that you can be connected to other protocol and making sure you build a developer community around your ecosystem, inviting everyone to build on top of you, providing their own tech with your product under the hood, basically acting like a middleware. And I think the best example for that is the way they build their community since the last three years on Hackathon and the developer community behind them. It's really what make you grow this kind of TVL stuff.
00:22:09.910 - 00:22:56.266, Speaker E: Yeah, I just want to add on to that comment because I think we are more focused on differentiation. So I think for existing players, so folks like Ave, those leaders in the market, for them it's easy play because they can expand to new markets. So obviously on the Polkadot world there's new asset class, there's growing community. You can't imagine. We have folks who have never used wallet before. They come to Polkadot, come to Acala and they learn this new way of financial freedom. So yeah, I think through this new ecosystem, folks like existing players like Ave can gain newcomers to the ecosystem.
00:22:56.266 - 00:23:47.280, Speaker E: And I think at the same time for the newer developers coming to the ecosystem you need differentiation because there are existing players out there. How do you outcompete? So on our platform we actually offer things like you can actually pay fees in your own token, you don't need to pay this ease as gas fee thing. You can customize that if you want. And we also have this, especially if you are DeFi of course we have this new thing with quality of service that I mentioned earlier that if you want chain link as a price fee that's guaranteed, included in the block, and also other automations that help you to liquidate your protocol. So it's safer, it's faster, it's more scalable. So I think whichever play you are, I think this is an attractive place to build together. So, yeah, that's us.
00:23:49.650 - 00:24:04.038, Speaker A: Awesome. Any other thoughts on that? Okay. As we close out the panel, I would just love to hear from each person, maybe a couple of words on what you're excited about heading into 2022. Where is DFI going? Jay Yoon, how about you?
00:24:04.124 - 00:24:43.060, Speaker C: Yeah, I think in DeFi, there are many Defi now. They are emerging, and I think synthetic assets are important ones in 2022 because lending or decks or state of coins, those metas are already emerging, but synthetic assets are not emerging yet. So I think people will use those standard assets more and this will make some other things in the next year.
00:24:43.830 - 00:24:44.578, Speaker E: Cool.
00:24:44.744 - 00:24:46.900, Speaker A: Thank you, James. Real fast.
00:24:47.590 - 00:24:48.146, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:48.248 - 00:25:10.214, Speaker D: So I think DeFi should be into more mainstream since there will be more regulatory. Of course, blockchain is not that major industry yet, but we are heading there. So I hope more countries will have stable regulations regarding DeFi so there can be more use cases from DeFi.
00:25:10.262 - 00:25:10.860, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:11.710 - 00:25:12.218, Speaker E: Awesome.
00:25:12.304 - 00:25:22.620, Speaker A: Thank you. Yes. Please follow our panelists on social media if you want to ask them more questions. We're all out of time, but this has been amazing talking to each of you, and I hope you each enjoy the conference. Thank you.
00:25:23.790 - 00:25:24.778, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:25:24.944 - 00:25:31.520, Speaker B: All right. Thank you, Zaji and all of our panelists for that incredible discussion. Really interesting to hear what everyone had to say.
