00:00:08.010 - 00:00:22.480, Speaker A: All right, welcome, everyone. We have another great guest here. We have Madeline from Syncs Network. My name is Harris. I'm a part of Chainlink Labs. And we're excited to bring to you another great q and A to unpack a little bit about what's going on in the broader DFI and game Phi space in Web three. So, Madeline, welcome.
00:00:22.480 - 00:00:25.046, Speaker A: Hello, everyone.
00:00:25.108 - 00:00:28.726, Speaker B: One, thanks for having me. It's really nice to be here with you guys.
00:00:28.908 - 00:00:38.600, Speaker A: Awesome, man. Awesome. So, just to get things started, if you don't mind, tell us a little bit about what you guys are working on here with Sphinx network. How does it work and what makes it so special in the.
00:00:38.970 - 00:00:40.250, Speaker C: Okay. Okay, perfect.
00:00:40.320 - 00:01:23.400, Speaker B: So let's start with, first of all, understanding what Sphinx network is. We should know that it's a protocol which merges the DeFi space, the NFTs, and the gamify. And it's using alchemy blockchain, because we're going to see further on what alchemy blockchain means. Things network is turning them into a DFI 2.0, if you want to call it like this. That complies with the new era of yield farming and staking, liquidity mining, the NFT part of.
00:01:25.050 - 00:01:42.030, Speaker A: So, you know, in that vein, I guess, starting on the defi front, right, we've now expanded a little bit with the recent integrations with Chainlink here into more NFT and gamefi use cases. What's really inspired the expansion of your offering into these areas of the industry?
00:01:43.570 - 00:02:40.400, Speaker B: Well, I guess it has been about the NFTs and about the NFT staking right from the start, at least at a concept level. The proof of concept has been tightly connected to this form of staking, which is NFT noncustodial staking. And we're going to talk about it right away. Well, the NFTs, everybody knows about the NFDs, that we can use them when we are seeing them as collectibles. So if we want to make money with it, the only thing available right now is to flip them on different marketplaces and, of course, make a profit, a potential profit. That would be mostly it. We're at the point where we have cloned, if you want to call it like this, the financial system.
00:02:40.400 - 00:03:12.280, Speaker B: And I'm talking about the DeFi, right, the decentralized finance. And we are at the point where we are adding a form of gamification to it, which is fueled by the nfTs. So, talking about this, this is the whole mixture of nfDs, deFi, and the gamify area.
00:03:13.770 - 00:03:14.760, Speaker A: Yeah, man.
00:03:17.370 - 00:03:18.120, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:03:18.810 - 00:04:11.418, Speaker B: So for it to add as to answer your question, the products that we should mention about spins network is there are four of them. And first of all, we're going to talk about this form of noncustodial staking because you were asking, how is it working? Okay, we understood that we're merging all of these things, but what's the outcome? What's happening, actually? So we all know that the regular staking requires the user to send the tokens to a contract. And the contract is going to start sending rewards to the user, right? So actually, this means that you need to renounce ownership of your tokens. You're renouncing custody of your assets.
00:04:11.514 - 00:04:12.160, Speaker C: Okay?
00:04:13.010 - 00:04:40.230, Speaker B: But this form of noncustodial staking actually allows users to lock their tokens in their wallet. So assets are never leaving their wallets. And they're just announcing the farms that their tokens are locked and the farms should start sending them the rewards.
00:04:41.210 - 00:04:41.958, Speaker C: Okay?
00:04:42.124 - 00:04:56.490, Speaker B: And one of the most important benefits of doing so is the fact that users can actually stake the same tokens in multiple farms simultaneously.
00:04:57.150 - 00:04:57.562, Speaker C: Okay?
00:04:57.616 - 00:05:23.474, Speaker B: So if we'd like to, let's talk about, just as a fast example, if I want to make a term deposit with any bank. Okay, first of all, let's say I want to deposit $100,000. First of all, I need to have the money, $100,000. Then I need to go to the bank, give them the money, and come back at the end of the year for the interest that the bank had.
00:05:23.512 - 00:05:24.210, Speaker C: Promised.
00:05:30.170 - 00:05:50.810, Speaker B: Doing the loan. Now imagine having the $100,000 and going to five different banks in the same time simultaneously, and deposit the $100,000 and receiving rewards simultaneously from five different banks. Okay, this is the sort of alchemy I was mentioning about earlier.
00:05:51.790 - 00:05:52.540, Speaker C: Okay.
00:05:53.470 - 00:06:19.734, Speaker B: This is the non custodial form of staking. And I guess this is what syncs network is doing different from the regular staking. Let's call it like this. We have come to the point that we're already talking about new ways of staking, a DeFi 2.0, which is amazing to say.
00:06:19.772 - 00:06:22.182, Speaker C: So. No?
00:06:22.236 - 00:07:01.550, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think that the next iteration of the development, as you're expanding on here, is game changing in a way. We're creating new ideas, new types of infrastructure, new types of technology, and it breeds into different types of use cases of things like nfts to generate new types of almost financial instruments, if you want to even call it that. If we were to expand on that path with what you're working on with the NFTs and DeFi, it bleeds into this new buzword new space called Gamefi, which has been around for a little bit for maybe some of the viewers. It could be new. Can you elaborate a little bit on what that means to you and how you see Gamefi at Sphinx Network?
00:07:01.710 - 00:07:54.210, Speaker B: Of course, I'm going to start, right, with telling you that gamify actually is just a merge, another merge of the game itself and the financial instruments, the monetary policies that have been created into the decentralized finance system. Well, this being said, imagine that you can mint an NFT in the game. You're actually minting an NFT that looks like a chest. And this chest has a smart wallet function by contract design that allows this chest to hold other tokens, or nfts.
00:07:54.630 - 00:07:55.234, Speaker C: Okay?
00:07:55.352 - 00:08:06.866, Speaker B: And this is really easy to understand, the fact that if I have five tokens in my wallet and I want to send them, I need to make five different transfers.
00:08:06.898 - 00:08:07.526, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:07.708 - 00:08:19.510, Speaker B: But having one chest and sending the chest from a wallet to another with its contained assets, it's making me pay one time, one fee only because I'm sending the chest.
00:08:19.670 - 00:08:20.380, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:20.930 - 00:09:01.302, Speaker B: And I think this is another huge benefit of what you can actually do with nfds in defi space, because you're actually defying your nfds in the game. Another example would be that in the game, if you want to stake something, you can leave your ammo or whatever item in game item, you can live it in the crafting section for a specific period of time, and it gains different stats, better stats.
00:09:01.446 - 00:09:02.140, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:03.390 - 00:09:54.650, Speaker B: So this is how you can actually cover, because there's a lot of people playing games, and there's a lot of people knowing about the nfTs, right? But they do not know, what is it that you could actually do with this kind of technology? Because people are embracing the nfPs, and they're coming based on the hype of it, and they're discovering, like, what? I can send my tokens. Just, I can send a chest with five tokens in it. Well, this is magic. I can deposit my money with five different banks at the same time. Again, sort of financially, instruments that are new. This is what's actually going on.
00:09:54.800 - 00:10:19.570, Speaker A: Absolutely. And so, I mean, I think it's an interesting evolution of use cases that have a veil of different types of, let's say, the UX. Like, the user experience may look differently, but the infrastructure is something that is innovative, and it could be different. And so, in the infrastructural side of things, Madeline, like, how does Chainlink come into the picture to help power some of these experiences that you guys are creating with Sphinx network.
00:10:20.870 - 00:11:28.486, Speaker B: Well, first of all, we have integrated from Chainlink VRF technology, and we have done this in two different phases. First of all, we've used it. Chainlink VRF supplied temper proof random number to Sphinx society, which is our NFT platform, which is our NFT project. The side of it, because the nfTs, they have a phase, the non custodial staking has a phase, which is the nfTs. And their use case in this whole procedure is going to be a boost in APIs for delegators for people who are doing staking. Okay, well, we got this clear, and I was saying earlier that Chainlink helped us with randomness in the creation, actually, of the nfDs. Because random generated art, this is about combining layers and coming up with an NFT.
00:11:28.598 - 00:11:29.018, Speaker C: Right?
00:11:29.104 - 00:11:51.118, Speaker B: And we have used chain link to get this unique trade combination. This is the first phase. And then we're integrating into the game itself. We are integrating the chainlink VRF as well.
00:11:51.204 - 00:11:51.550, Speaker C: Okay.
00:11:51.620 - 00:12:03.220, Speaker B: Sync civilization is the name of the game. And actually there, Chainlink is going to help us with a sort of randomness that will.
00:12:05.210 - 00:12:07.154, Speaker C: In the PvE and PvP.
00:12:07.202 - 00:12:39.902, Speaker B: Interactions in the game will allow us to know essentially every time a player is going to attack another player, think civilization is going to use chain link VRF to generate randomness, determining, let's say, how strong the attack was or how well the other player defended, or how much loots can the attacker take away from that interaction, from that event.
00:12:40.036 - 00:12:40.720, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:42.050 - 00:13:53.062, Speaker B: And then another thing that we are planning to integrate is the FSS from re jewels, which is chief scientist at chain Link Labs, that is going to help us with a decks that we haven't planned to build. The decks is going to be based on. It's going to have a form of incentivizing the people that are not aware of the actual technology. And it's going to be an instant cash back tax. And then on the other side, for the people that do understand the importance of mev, which stands for minor extractable value. And it's an issue, I'm going to make a parenthesis here. It's an issue that's surging with incredible speed based on the fact that we're going towards decentralization, right? And detectives are one of these segments of this world, let's call it like this.
00:13:53.062 - 00:14:15.870, Speaker B: So meb, front running and sandwich attacks are really important matters that are surging up because there's incredible amounts of money there. And talking about the services coming from Chainlink, the FSS, which stands for the frequency.
00:14:18.210 - 00:14:19.886, Speaker A: Ferrous sequencing service.
00:14:20.068 - 00:15:10.640, Speaker B: Exactly. It was not coming to my mind. Yeah. So that will help us actually protect the users from getting front brand. Okay, we have a few options that we're considering. Another one is flash bots that use different technology, or a hidden mempool would be another one where actually miners do not get to see transactions unless they're bundled like three, so they have no place to put, like to buy it before. But on the other hand, since we are going forward with chaining and integrating technology from chaining, I see no other reason why we should not use the FSS service.
00:15:13.170 - 00:15:13.582, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:13.636 - 00:15:58.000, Speaker A: So, malib, I could just recap real quick for the audience here. So, from top to bottom, essentially we're looking at using the verifiable randomness function to ensure transparency and predictability, in a way, random predictability in the generation of the nfts that then help create a newer and different in game experience that we're also talking about using VRF for. To have probabilistic randomness, if I understand you correctly, like predictive outcomes in a trust and verified way in that game. Is that fair to say? And then you're looking even maybe down the road in your roadmap to embedding this ethos into other components of what you guys are building.
00:15:58.450 - 00:15:59.198, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:59.364 - 00:16:00.174, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:16:00.372 - 00:16:17.640, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. And so if you don't mind, let's continue to think about what's ahead. So, in terms of what Sphinx network is working on, what's else is in the roadmap, is there more gamefi? Is there more verifiable randomness? I guess. Where are you guys looking to go into the future?
00:16:18.330 - 00:17:05.734, Speaker B: I'll tell you right now. Well, we are now focusing on building the infrastructure for the NFT, staking and the algorithms for the rewards, of course, taking care, making sure that existing products are working, which every single, there is always things to do. Right? And we're making sure that everything works fine. Down the roadmap, we have the marketplace, which is an NFD marketplace with different segments and different futures. Of course there's going to be the place where people can flip their nfds. We're trying to make it available to everyone based on their level of experience. Right.
00:17:05.734 - 00:18:28.346, Speaker B: So if they just want to join and flip their nfds, they can. If they, for example, want to use the area where they can fractionalize their nfds, we're going to have that as well. We're going to have a place where people, because nfds, it's such an illiquid asset, especially when it's high valued, that it's really hard for the owner to take advantage or do something with that. So by fractionalizing it and selling it in fractions, it's turning the NFT into something which is more liquid then in the same NFT marketplace. In the same marketplace, let's call it plea, there's going to be as well, the area where people can customize their characters from the game with different nfts they own. And we're still thinking if we're going to add the breed future to the Sphinx civilizations, because the concept is going to be really nice, but maybe further on we're going to have something like that. And yeah, this would be the marketplace.
00:18:28.346 - 00:19:09.290, Speaker B: And of course, the ultimate goal, it's the game itself, which is going to feature two battle modes. One is going to be adventure, where players are going to earn in game rewards like mystery boxes or different tokens. As I was mentioning earlier as well, they can defy their nfds in the game itself. And there's going to be the player versus player p to p section where people, users is going to, players are going to fight each other for rewards.
00:19:10.510 - 00:19:41.800, Speaker A: I guess just to close out here, madeline, I think it's very interesting to hear what you guys have in the pipeline in terms of what you see in the future, bringing even more utility to technology like nfts, creating more opportunities for people to get involved, to leverage the technology and have great experiences with nfts and the associated utility. So just to tie it up, if people were to want to figure out what's going on in Sphinx network or if they were to want to find you to learn more, what are the best ways to follow you and the organization here?
00:19:43.130 - 00:20:11.966, Speaker B: Everywhere. We are all over. We're on Telegram, we're on discord. We have social media channels, Twitter, Instagram. People, they can search for Sphinx Network on Coinmarketcap, Coingecko. We're listed there so they can find all our socials. And on Finx network, that's the website.
00:20:11.966 - 00:20:16.094, Speaker B: And everything is good.
00:20:16.132 - 00:20:16.526, Speaker C: Very good.
00:20:16.548 - 00:20:33.638, Speaker A: So you guys are accessible everywhere? We try to be as well. If you guys like this conversation, please think about subscribing. Feel free to drop a like, leave a comment. We'll be hosting more conversations like this in the future. Madeline, thanks so much for joining us today. We hope you have a great day.
00:20:33.804 - 00:20:36.420, Speaker B: Thank you guys for having me. You guys have a great day as well.
