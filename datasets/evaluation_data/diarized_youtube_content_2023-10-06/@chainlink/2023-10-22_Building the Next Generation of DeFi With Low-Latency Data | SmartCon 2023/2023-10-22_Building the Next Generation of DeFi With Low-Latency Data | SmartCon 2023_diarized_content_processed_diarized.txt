00:00:06.570 - 00:00:06.830, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:06.900 - 00:00:23.070, Speaker B: Thank you everyone. I am so excited to be here. I've been waiting for this panel. Seems like maybe years, years in development planning. Finally. So excited that we actually have this thing available today. And we have assembled some of the industry's best experts.
00:00:23.070 - 00:00:43.846, Speaker B: Got AJ from. We've got Davi from primitive ventures and a longtime GMX community member, Caldora from Osteom and Pedro from Zaros. So why don't we just get started with just a couple of sentences about yourself and a couple of sentences about your project. We'll go ahead and start with AJ.
00:00:44.038 - 00:01:08.690, Speaker C: Yeah. Hi guys, my name is AJ and I'm a part of the core team behind perennial. We've been building derivatives on arbitram since February this year. We're a perpetual swap protocol, amm based with funding rates that are based on open interest. And yeah, we've been leveraging chain link with our v one and yeah, really excited to release our v two soon with some new low latency feeds.
00:01:09.030 - 00:01:38.714, Speaker D: Hey guys, my name is Davi Wan. So we are a crypto holding company, and so I've been investing the space since 2014, so almost ten year now. And yeah, so when it comes to DFI. So my first interaction with DFI is actually long before the actual DFI thing that was at bit shares and some of the core team of bitshares become founder of Maker Dow. And then. So my first official DFI investment was Kyber back in 2017 and Zero X. And then.
00:01:38.714 - 00:02:15.814, Speaker D: So back then there was not d personally think currency, like sound money is the biggest application for permissionless decentralized finance. And so for bitcoin, we just unbanked the banked and then so for DeFi. And I think eventually we're going to just on chain the are. So we have team members in Singapore, Shanghai, Dubai, like San Francisco. And so, yeah, we are not like a typical vc because we never raise from outside. So we play the founders game. Yeah.
00:02:15.932 - 00:02:17.826, Speaker B: Okay, great. Caldora.
00:02:18.018 - 00:03:16.470, Speaker E: I'm Calidora, co founder at Osteom Labs. We are building the Osteom protocol, which is the first decentralized perpetuals exchange for real world assets, starting with commodities and forex. So what that means is we give you the opportunity to trade things like WTI or gold or your favorite forex majors all on chain synthetically without needing to offboard. I think the real sort of motivation behind this was one we wanted to sort of increase opportunities for diversification on chain. Most of what we see in the RWA space is focused on sort of tokenization on institutions and largely on bringing yield on chain, we're more interested on the trader side and on the consumer side. How do we enable traders sort of using a format or primitive that is familiar to many traders, namely a perp perp swap. How do we allow traders to get exposure to other types of asset classes, especially for traders that are interested in sort of punting on macro events, things like OPEC supply cuts or fed interest rates, CPI and so forth.
00:03:16.470 - 00:03:40.100, Speaker E: So that's sort of the first part, enabling on chain traders to gain diversifying access to new asset classes. I think the longer term really vision and roadmap is sort of bringing more accessibility and sort of democratizing access to asset classes that are currently very underserved in the traditional markets. Commodities are sort of top of that list, but forex and then other asset classes are further down that list. So that's us.
00:03:40.550 - 00:03:42.750, Speaker B: Exciting stuff there. Go ahead, Pedro.
00:03:42.910 - 00:04:14.538, Speaker A: Hello everyone. So my name is Pedro. I've been working as a blockchain engineer for four to five years now. Before Zaros, I used to work as the head of blockchain at Illuvium, a game five protocol, and now we are building Zaros. It's the first preps protocol powered by lsts. So our mission is to drive LST liquidity to earn trading rewards from all two preps markets. We're using a set of different channeling services like automation, data streams, CCIP.
00:04:14.538 - 00:04:19.840, Speaker A: Pretty glad to be here with such big brains, so thanks for having me.
00:04:20.210 - 00:04:30.260, Speaker B: All right, thank you, Pedro. Yeah, so let's start off here and we'll go ahead and start with you, Pedro. Why do derivatives matter? Like, what's all the excitement about derivatives in the space?
00:04:30.790 - 00:05:37.000, Speaker A: So I believe derivatives and lsts, that's why we chose to focus on lsts as our main driver at Zados, are one of the few PMF cases we have in DFI and web3 in general. So DFI and blockchains are able to improve ten x 100 x improvements to centralized trading experience. We've been seeing some experiments over the last few years and we had a lot of technical limitations which I think are starting to being overcome finally with data strings. And it's an important avenue for traders to be able to trade with security, decentralization, transparency, censorship, resistance, and as we have seen many problems and centralized exchanges and centralized venues. So I believe it's really important to have over the next few years decentralized trading as the go to place for any trader, not only crypto, but also real world assets. Like other projects are working on forex commodities. So yeah.
00:05:37.450 - 00:05:42.600, Speaker B: Okay, great. Caldora, why don't you tell us what's exciting to you about the derivative space?
00:05:43.290 - 00:06:18.354, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I would just echo a lot of sort of what Pedro said. I think this is really one of the places where we currently have PMF in crypto. Going back to what I was saying earlier about sort of giving traders, I mean, we're most interested in the sort of diversifying assets. There's a lot of people working on purely that we'll offer blue chip crypto assets, but really our focus is on other asset classes. I think the reason we wanted to offer these assets under a trading format that is familiar to traders, basically through this perps engine is this is really what has PMF. This is what traders are comfortable interacting with. And I think there's just still so much further to go.
00:06:18.354 - 00:06:28.390, Speaker E: So taking a familiar product and a product that really has PMF and applying it to another set of asset classes to expand the sort of the use case for this sort of primitive.
00:06:28.550 - 00:06:32.794, Speaker B: All right, fantastic. Dovey, what are you excited about in the derivative space?
00:06:32.912 - 00:07:34.798, Speaker D: Yeah, so derivative, we as investor. So we think about growth, right? If we look at the current volume and volume, like the d five perps, volume is only 2% of the c five perps, there's at least like 50 x of the growth room. So of the growth out there. And then also if we think about users, Coinbase plus finance combined 200 million users and matter mass only 20 million. And when it comes to active on chain users, at most like 200,000 and Uniswap, like 50k dAu, right? And so from user perspective, and then we also have at least 100 x of the space out there, assuming nothing grow at the top of funnel. So that's why our thesis has been pretty simple. It's just a vampire test deFi, right? And I think the other thing is, over the course of my past few cycles, what I realized is every cycle is the same.
00:07:34.798 - 00:08:04.706, Speaker D: So it's always centered around new things to trade or like new way to trade. 2014 color coin and 2017 ERC 20. ERC 20, from just a token standard perspective is basically the upgrade of color coin. And 2021 is NFT. NFT basically is color coin on steroid. So that's why I think the next cycle, and also we can see the mini bull market driven by ordinary as well, right? So every cycle is the same. And then also every cycle there's also this fundamental risk.
00:08:04.706 - 00:08:41.202, Speaker D: It's the same, it's the counterparty risk. So I personally have been through both mongods and then also bifinex and then so it's close to Wipow. And so that's why we are extremely counterparted with paranoia. And then so we are able to dodge all the bullets like this time, like no three ac, no fts whatsoever because luckily we have all our cash position in GLP, so there's no bear market for us. Right. Like pretty happy. Just having said that, I think the value proposition of let Defi is pretty clear.
00:08:41.202 - 00:08:44.830, Speaker D: It's just non negotiable and then non questionable.
00:08:44.990 - 00:08:49.218, Speaker B: Yeah, great. Okay, AJ, what's got you excited about derivatives?
00:08:49.394 - 00:09:44.150, Speaker C: Yeah, I think echoing some of what Dovi said, it's basically like centralized exchanges have, what with perps have two thirds of all crypto volumes generally. So perps obviously have a massive amount of product market fit. And I think everyone on this stage wants to play a part in bringing that volume on chain. And a lot of that is down to maybe making the Dex perp experience mirror more what you get on a centralized exchange, whether that's through things like Chainlink's lower latency oracles. And I think it's mainly like an execution thing for traders, but I think it's mainly just the opportunity size and that's why it's such a competitive vertical and it's why perennial is competing in that space and why we're positioning ourselves as a base layer primitive that can host a variety of markets, whether that's real world nfts, your standard sort of crypto blue chips. Yeah.
00:09:44.220 - 00:09:55.530, Speaker B: Great. Okay, so when we talk about latency, and we're talking about this, data streams extremely fast, low latency data, why was that so important in derivatives? And we'll go ahead and start again with you, AJ.
00:09:55.950 - 00:10:33.478, Speaker C: Yeah, I think when you look at what a perb trader actually like, the user profile of that, it's not someone who's bought their first bitcoin yesterday. It's like a prosumer, it's like a somewhat savvy trader. And most of these firms, they care about execution speeds. A lot of them are running algorithmic strategies, they're running bots. So I mean, even with perennial v one, we were using the legacy chain link oracles, for instance. And these were originally designed with borough and lend in mind. The oracle updates on these were between ten minutes to like half an hour at times, which is a terrible UX issue, really.
00:10:33.478 - 00:10:55.002, Speaker C: And that's why I think moving to these lower latency oracles is just going to make it all the more easier to sort of onboard the next cohort of traders into derivatives. I think it's pretty much just down to the user experience that is now going to just get closer to mirroring what you see on a centralized venue.
00:10:55.146 - 00:11:00.618, Speaker B: Yeah, great. Debbie, what do you think about latency importance and your protocols?
00:11:00.714 - 00:11:28.294, Speaker D: Yeah, so I want to just make a very interesting analogy, being like a biohacker for like ten years as well. So Roger and I, we chat about our longevity tricks off the stage. So fundamentally there's that one driver. So in the whole universe, basically that's the entropy. And entropy always grow, right? So that's why universe will always expand. Eventually we'll be hit that. And then, so if our human body like the entropy to the mass, then we die.
00:11:28.294 - 00:12:02.050, Speaker D: So I think it all boils down to basically how to race against time, right. And then, so when it comes to the capital market. And so there's two driving forces when it comes to the capital market. That's volatility and then also cost of capital. And both of them is very time sensitive. And then so has different stakeholders, or different market participants has different time preferences, but they all very time sensitive. And so that's the reason why we are not going to stay in low volatility.
00:12:02.050 - 00:12:40.334, Speaker D: Low volatility market forever, because there's a cost of capital for all the traders. And before the low latency oracle and the problem with onchain purpose, there's a lot of this toxic flow, like toxic flow from all the arbitrators because the price fee update cannot be on par with the off chain. And so that's why there's all this toxic forages that drive away the real organic volume. So I think that's the value of the low latency oracle price fee because it basically gives us the advantages to race against the time.
00:12:40.532 - 00:12:55.140, Speaker B: Yeah, great. All right, so I think we've got a pretty good sampling of why latency is important there. Caldera, what do you think? Now that we have data streams and we have this low latency data, what do you think of the new things that we can build that we couldn't build before?
00:12:56.070 - 00:13:30.666, Speaker E: I actually maybe want to answer that question a different way by maybe focusing more on, I think, another product announcement that you guys had this week, which was automations 2.0, which we're using along with data streams. I think both of you guys focused on uX, and that's obviously super important for us as well. This is why obviously we're using data streams. I think others have in the past in order to avoid the UX issues of having very slow updates. Basically gone towards building their own oracle system, their own in house oracles, or using, for instance, chainlinks, Don, and sourcing their own APIs. I think actually what we're really interested in, and this is enabled really by automations as well for all of the non user triggered orders.
00:13:30.666 - 00:14:44.978, Speaker E: So for liquidations or stop losses or limit orders, is sort of limiting the bias or the opportunity for the protocol itself to have bias or have sort of adverse selection or adverse incentives in terms of how any of these non user triggered orders are performed. And so for us, really combining both the automations and the low latency feeds allows us to disintermediate the process of either selecting the price that's being put on chain, or deciding or whether or not sort of non user triggered orders are actually executed in the way that they should be, at the price that they should be, and at the time that they should be. And I think you see for a lot of dexes and a lot of this has just come down to sort of infrastructural limitations that is now changing with exactly as you mentioned, this data streams and automations, you can sort of, the outsource isn't the right word, but sort of disintermediate you as a dex don't need to be both. Sourcing the price feeds, which can obviously create an adverse incentive. If, for instance, you're trading on your own exchange and you're supposed to be getting liquidated, you might not post a price, or you might post a price that's slightly higher if you should have gotten liquidated. So that's sort of on the price side, and then on the automation side, basically you could withhold, for instance, liquidations for a certain asset or for particular trade. You obviously have seen this with centralized exchanges.
00:14:44.978 - 00:15:24.782, Speaker E: There's a lot of stories with the exchange that shall not be named, but I think we're really excited both about the better UX, but also really about the ability to create a more unbiased and disintermediated protocol. Experience that users can have trust and faith is actually executing trades and embodying the principles of DeFi. I think. Last thing I'll say is I think a lot of people trade in DeFi thinking that it'll absolve them or ensure that they won't face a lot of the sort of decentralization and bias risks that centralized exchanges have. That's just not always the case, because people often will build in house solutions or solutions that enable them to be biased against traders. So we're trying to eliminate that, yeah, fantastic.
00:15:24.846 - 00:15:34.120, Speaker B: Well, we'll definitely circle back to that narrative a bit later when we talk about safe trading. Pedro, what do you think this enables things that you could build, that you couldn't build before?
00:15:34.810 - 00:16:40.790, Speaker A: I think it's pretty interesting that collateral brought automation vin two, because at autos we're also building with this setup. And so I think everyone brought excellent points on decentralization transparency that are fundamental on building new DeFi products. But one thing that I also maybe sometimes is not as much appreciated, but I think it's also a big gang for developers is that DeFi is a lot about composable legos. So when you build a new primitive like low latency data automation v two being very easily to offload computation and jobs to chain link decentralized Oracle network, I think it's amazing for developers that you don't need to reinvent the wheel every time you want to build a new product or you want to iterate. And especially now that with the current market situation, things need to iterate fast ship products, test with the community. And if you have to imagine having to rebuild the whole secure infrastructure, aggregating from different APIs, you have a lot of risks. There is unsafe trading.
00:16:40.790 - 00:17:18.306, Speaker A: You cannot be sure whether the data provider is not trading against you or not if it's not a reliable source. So it automatically turns your dev into ten X engineers simply by leveraging infrastructure that's already secure tested. And it's being a big gain by using automation v two alongside data streams to our team. And we've been able to build much faster than, I guess, in the past before you had this technology. Let's say imagine in 2018, you went to build a decentralized exchange, like when there was only ethereum. You didn't even have l two s. So now it's much faster.
00:17:18.306 - 00:17:40.160, Speaker A: One point, it's a bit off topic, but I also just wanted to quickly bring is that I also think leveraging load ATC data alongside account abstraction is probably what we need in order to scale to have defi apps with centralized finance or centralized exchanges properties. And I think we're getting there. So yeah, I'm pretty excited for building with these new products.
00:17:40.850 - 00:18:15.850, Speaker B: Thank you, Pedro. I think we're getting down to about the five minute mark, and I do want to get through some more topics here, but you guys brought up some really good things besides just latency. I've heard you mentioned things like credibly neutral, obviously, security, reliability, decentralization, censorship, resistance, the conflict free narrative where we don't have data providers running the infrastructure and things like that, or we don't have people trading against your protocol. How much of those factors in were important to you when choosing to work with Chainlink Labs? And we'll start again with you, Pedro.
00:18:16.350 - 00:18:53.890, Speaker A: So I think for us it's been a pretty easy decision because since we already were using Chainlink regular standard data feeds alongside CCIP, I think it was like the easiest decision. By not delegating our infrastructure to a third party provider, that would increase our number of trust assumptions. So it's just no brainer for us to use the same infrastructure, the same security, the same trust assumptions. Also, of course, the quality and the track record of the team. I think that has been our main point to decide on using data streams.
00:18:54.050 - 00:19:00.170, Speaker B: Okay, great. Caldera, how much of those factors played a role in you choosing Chainlink labs?
00:19:00.670 - 00:19:43.218, Speaker E: Yeah, I would agree with basically everything that Pedro said. Maybe the only thing I would add is that Chainlink has so many complementary products, and I think Sergey outlined this brilliantly in the keynote yesterday, sort of stitching together from automations to data streams to CCIP, all of the products and how they sort of fit together, creating this sort of larger vision of what it means to bring another trillions of dollars of value on chain launch new primitives and so forth. Straightforward for us that the longer term roadmap, our longer term roadmap, certainly aligns with the sort of chain longer term roadmap and vision and seeing how those pieces will fit together with our growth as we move towards a v two and beyond. Yeah, pretty obvious choice.
00:19:43.314 - 00:19:46.342, Speaker B: Yeah, great. Okay, dovey, how about those factors for you?
00:19:46.476 - 00:20:32.840, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think in order to vampire tag like Cx or like CFI in general, and then, so we have to just vampire tag their business model. And so I think it's not very publicly known, like many of these centralized exchanges that their business model. So they intentionally not open up their API for the outside API traders because they just want to warehouse their own users trade. So that is one of the core value proposition. So their core advantages running decentralized exchanges. I can give you a very vivid example. When it comes to the early days of gms, there's only one developer, and now they have two developer, and then, so they have to cover all the time.
00:20:32.840 - 00:21:30.682, Speaker D: So in order to have their own keeper availability, good on time. Right. And so now everything can be offloaded to the chain link, Oracle, which is pretty handy for them. And then the other thing is previously, when we run our own keeper, so we can only fetch to a certain number of CX data feeds and we have no idea whether they're actually legit because back in the times. And so there's many incidents on Bitmax because at the index price on Bitmax is only on big stem and coinbase, and then bit stem's liquidity is pretty shallow. And so there's a lot of design manipulation happen trigger down to massive market liquidation. So that has happened many times in the Trifi and Stefi world.
00:21:30.682 - 00:21:37.590, Speaker D: And so that's why I think when it comes to fairness and then also transparency, and this is invaluable.
00:21:37.750 - 00:21:44.422, Speaker B: Okay, great. All right, AJ, really quick, how are these factored into your decision to work with Chainlink?
00:21:44.486 - 00:22:07.140, Speaker C: Yeah, I think as these guys have alluded to, it's a bit of a no brainer. I think having a decentralized protocol is at the heart of everything we do at perennial. So it's like, let's partner with the most decentralized Oracle network. Let's partner with someone who has a new commit and reveal architecture that mitigates a lot of the front running and the toxic flow that dovey alluded to. So, yeah, I think it's as simple as that, really.
00:22:07.770 - 00:22:34.810, Speaker E: I would maybe just add one thing, which is, I think often decentralization is synonymous with governance and voting on various proposals. I think actually, really the thing that's important is disintermediation and the different products, like allowing the neutral infrastructure and architecture that is better at executing a particular subset of what your dex needs to function correctly is the most important thing. And I think Chainlink has all of those various pieces that can fit in neatly.
00:22:34.970 - 00:23:00.422, Speaker B: All right, fantastic. Well, I can't believe we're already out of time. This has been fantastic. I really enjoyed all your insightful comments. Like I said, I've been personally working on this project for quite a long time. So being able to sit here and see this thing being able to be used is extremely rewarding for me personally. And I want to thank each and every one of you for taking your time to come to the conference and provide all of these detailed insights as being experts in your field.
00:23:00.422 - 00:23:01.606, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:23:01.788 - 00:23:07.060, Speaker C: Thank you. Close.
