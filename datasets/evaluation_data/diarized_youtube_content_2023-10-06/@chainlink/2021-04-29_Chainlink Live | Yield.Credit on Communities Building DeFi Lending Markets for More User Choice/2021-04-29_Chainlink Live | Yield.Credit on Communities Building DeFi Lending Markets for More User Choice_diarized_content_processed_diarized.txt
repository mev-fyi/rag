00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.310, Speaker A: What is it about DFI that kind of gets you up in the morning? It gets you excited?
00:00:04.530 - 00:00:08.014, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Deep question.
00:00:08.212 - 00:00:09.006, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:09.188 - 00:00:51.594, Speaker B: First of all, I think it's the pace over the past twelve months. If you compare where we are today to where we were last year, it's just an incredible amount of growth that we've experienced. One of the other things that excites me is there's a lot of inclusion, there's a lot of people that are able to come in. There's a bit of a learning curve, but if you're able to sit still and push through that, it's really just an open space that anyone can come in and start taking advantage of some of the solutions that we have using the blockchain finance. That's very exciting. And then obviously there's yield as well, which gets me up and going.
00:00:51.792 - 00:01:12.974, Speaker A: Well, we've got a great amount of people in here. Hey, everyone, my name is Andy Boyan. Welcome to Chainlink Live. I'm from Chainlink Labs and we are here talking today to a great lending project, yield credit. We've got tobe, we've got ant, and we're going to talk about their platform. And Mark's dropped a link in the chat. Feel free to drop your questions in the chat anytime.
00:01:12.974 - 00:01:39.900, Speaker A: We may wait until the end to get to them, we may pop them on right now, but feel free. Let's have a conversation with these fellows. We're going to learn about how retail can get involved. We're going to learn about how developers can get involved because there's some pretty cool synergies between developers and yield credit as well. But let's get this going. All right, introduce yourselves. How did you get involved and how did you start to come up with this idea for yield credit? Go ahead.
00:01:41.310 - 00:02:14.082, Speaker B: So thank you again, Andy and Chan, for giving us this platform. I'm tob, go by Tob. Background wise, I'm an attorney. Spent a few years practicing in Europe up until about 2012. Then I made my way to North America, where I practiced for over ten years now. Coming on ten years now. And my foray into crypto has really just been being around individuals that were very passionate about crypto.
00:02:14.082 - 00:03:03.638, Speaker B: They talked about it all the time as we hung out. And eventually, like, I'd say, half the people watching myself decided to join and sort of take a stab at it. Q four of 2017, which is a good time, right, market was surging, made a little bit of money, held onto everything I had, and you know what happened next, right, proceeded to lose a lot of money, and I hate to lose. So what ended up happening was I threw myself back to material. I started learning. I started aligning myself with just people that I thought were doing cool things, people that I thought had cool ideas. One such cool idea and a group of such cool people are the folks that are involved with yield credit.
00:03:03.638 - 00:03:07.638, Speaker B: So that's a little bit about me. Perfect.
00:03:07.724 - 00:04:05.898, Speaker C: I guess that's over to me. So I'm crypto, and most people know me as that, and that's what my telegram handle is. And I'm not a lawyer like Tobe, but I've got a background in banking, and that's been kind of my history in terms of sort of work, but similar to Tobe, I got into crypto when a friend of mine was talking about it, and it was back then when it was the unknown. And what is crypto, what is bitcoin? And those conversations that were happening back then, and I got involved in some projects pretty early, found my way around. And back then, information on crypto wasn't readily available as it is today. I think I used to spend most of my time on Slack and discord. I don't know if you guys remember slack, but I used to do it just to be able to understand projects, read up, get involved in the chats and what have you, but things obviously change now.
00:04:05.898 - 00:04:39.880, Speaker C: Telegram and Discord are now home to most projects as it is with yield of credit. And I guess what drew me as well into yield was kind of my background in banking aligned me nicely, and I don't have to use a slack platform anymore. We've moved forward in times, and we're on Telegram and Discord. But I think that transition over the years, even moving from different platforms, just shows how fast the crypto industry has moved and where we are today.
00:04:41.530 - 00:05:06.074, Speaker A: Yeah, this should be a takeaway for people who are new to the industry. The platforms have changed, but you still get involved in the same way. Like join telegrams, join discords, and read up and learn. There's communities and you just ask questions and join communities. And that's how I got where I am is I just got involved in communities and you eventually start building and things happen. Fantastic.
00:05:06.122 - 00:05:06.574, Speaker B: See? Right?
00:05:06.612 - 00:05:30.790, Speaker A: It's a very organic story. We hear people coming from 2017 getting curious. Everybody was new once, and so for those of you who are new now, there's time and come build with us. We've got a great question. That was actually my next question. So somebody did this right away. Yannick, I'm going to put you up here what differentiates yield from other protocols? What's yield all about as a lending protocol?
00:05:31.450 - 00:06:12.386, Speaker B: So I'll take this one. Yield is a lending platform. And I would say there are three pillars that define us. Ant can talk a little bit about the differentiators, but these three pillars are important to lead with. The first one is that yield focuses on borrowing, incentivized borrowing. So currently in the lending space on the blockchain, we're seeing a huge influx of value. Billions and billions of dollars have been added into these pools, lending pools, and ultimately that cash, that value, is being lent out.
00:06:12.386 - 00:07:09.814, Speaker B: But when you compare the amount that's actually being lent out to the amount that people are willing to lend, what you're seeing is that a fraction of that, about 50% of that value, is actually working. So the rest of the 50% is sat there and it's just sort of nabbing away at the interest that has been earned with the other 50%. That pillar where we've seen that and we've taken a step back and said we need to take care of borrowers. So that's the first pillar that I would say defines yield credit. The second one is something that's equally as important, and that is that we focus on fixed rate interest, right? So it's fixed rate lending that's individualized. And fixed rate is important because people want some kind of certainty that when they enter into a transaction with someone else, that the return they're looking at on their screen on that day is exactly what they're going to earn at the end of that term. Right.
00:07:09.814 - 00:08:19.034, Speaker B: Once the borrower has taken the principal, nursed that loan to maturity, and has repaid, that's important. The rates on yield credit range between 2% and 12.5%. And anywhere within that range, you can pick an interest rate that fits you, and that's exactly what you're going to make back at the end of the term. The third pillar that I would say defines yield credit has to do with the fact that the platform generates zero profits, right? So this platform is set up in such a way that, sure, you collect fees, but all those fees are used to purchase the yield token and those yield tokens are burned. So the combination between that third pillar and the first pillar, and there's something I missed in that very first pillar, which is that when you nurse a loan all the way till maturity and you repay it, you are actually afforded the right to mint the yield token. So you've got a minting function. When you're a good actor and you're repaying your loans, and what the platform does with all the fees that it generates is it buys back yield token and it burns it.
00:08:19.034 - 00:08:25.882, Speaker B: So those two components give you an idea of why our circulating supply is dynamic.
00:08:26.026 - 00:08:56.614, Speaker A: I think it's really interesting you think about the banking industry here in crypto. We like to trash it a lot, but if you just think about the basic mechanics of borrowing and lending. Banks don't make money on deposits. Like if you deposit money into a bank, a bank doesn't make any money there, they make money on lending. The lenders pay the money, which then returns to the funds, to the bank and to the original depositors. So we need to take care of borrowers in some way. They're paying for all this defi stuff in some measure or another.
00:08:56.614 - 00:08:58.406, Speaker A: Ant, did you want to talk about some of those?
00:08:58.508 - 00:09:29.006, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I think lending platforms, there's plenty of them out there. Incentivized Borrowing, it's been done, and there's some variation of kind of individual loans that's been done. And you might even heard that some of the platforms actually claim to actually provide p to b kind of loans. And I guess we do all of those things. That's what yield does. But I guess what sets us apart is the platform and the mechanics.
00:09:29.006 - 00:10:03.574, Speaker C: And I think there's a really crucial word here, which is freedom. Yield. Credit gives user the freedom to use the platform as they wish. The platform itself is designed to remain in the background as much as possible. And as Tobe said, we collect those fees. All those fees are used to buy back and burn those tokens, and that's given back to the community. Essentially, you can't swap the tokens on the platform as a borrower or principal.
00:10:03.574 - 00:10:58.846, Speaker C: You can collateralize as borrower, as principal, as a lender, and that's returned back to you in the precise amount. And I think the other thing to kind of note is the borrower and the lender is free to choose the interest rate. As Tove said, between that two and 15% yield doesn't choose those rates for you. And the fact that those individualized loans makes the participants have a smaller principal or the class will to work out, can lend at whatever rates you want to borrow funds at, or that they're willing to pay. And I think lastly, that downward trending interest rates are avoided. The variation of pooled mechanisms in lending is quite disadvantageous to other lenders. And the variation of pooling used by some of the other lending platforms mimics a pooling or rewarding system.
00:10:58.846 - 00:11:41.450, Speaker C: You might possibly find in farming. I guess in farming, the person with largest percentage of the pool will get the most rewards. But when you translate that to kind of lending, it becomes the largest percentage of the pool gets the most amount of interest. That's not the case kind of with yield credit. So whether you're willing to lend $1,000 or $50,000, you decide that rate, how much interest you get paid, isn't correlated to or dependent on other lenders. I guess those three things in a nutshell is possibly kind of how yield of credit differs from those other projects.
00:11:42.130 - 00:11:49.760, Speaker B: Just really quickly, I wanted to make sure we got this right. The maximum interest rate that you can get on yield credit is twelve and a half percent.
00:11:52.530 - 00:12:12.886, Speaker A: So for people who have joined us a little bit late, my name is Andy Boyen with Chainlink Labs. I'm here with yield credit. Tob and ant. We're talking about lending and their platform really already diving into some really great topics. We've got some great questions from the audience. Keep those questions coming. I wanted to touch on something.
00:12:12.886 - 00:12:27.740, Speaker A: You guys are talking about this fixed rate and how people can set their own rate. And then tobe, you just jumped in and said there's a maximum rate. Can you just kind of break down? What is it about a fixed rate that's special? And how does that work? A little bit? Let's get into the sausage a little bit here.
00:12:28.590 - 00:13:12.202, Speaker B: Yeah, I can do that. But if you'll allow me, I'd like to lead you there as to why that is important. When I joined and started looking at blockchain as a solution, as a technology, you start reading all these documents, you enter the Telegram groups and the sense you get is that there are some promises being made, right? So the first promise that the blockchain makes as a blockchain makes as a technology is that there is going to be transparency, right? You've got this ledger that everyone can look at and everyone can follow what's happening with various values that are put on blockchain. That's great. Enough of that. Transparency ultimately leads to inclusion. Inclusion is great.
00:13:12.202 - 00:14:13.934, Speaker B: Like we talked about earlier, Andy, anyone can join. Anyone can just need an Internet connection and off you go type thing. So that's a good thing as well. Certainly once you look at how things grew through 2017, even during crypto winter up until now, you'll see that there's a lot of solutions, a lot of dapps that have been built. So there's a lot of access, right? It's not just the promise of transparency inclusion, you also have access. Now, all of that is great, but it only works if ultimately the user, when they eventually have that decentralized application in their hands on their smartphones, actually have options. And options is what gives value to each and every single one of those promises that admit that is made by blockchain, by blockchain technology, right? So when you look at fixed rate interest and you look at the fact that the borrower or the lender can pick an interest rate, sure, between two and twelve and a half percent.
00:14:13.934 - 00:14:50.102, Speaker B: But you're picking the interest rate that you want to lend your value, right? And if you're a borrower and you scroll through our app and you don't find a specific lending offer that meets your requirements, you can actually put up a borrowing offer and say, hey, I want to borrow 5000 at this interest rate for this duration. That's a freedom. Freedom. That's a freedom that you have. And that freedom, freedom. One side of the coin, the other side of the coin is called options. That option is what actually gives value to transparency.
00:14:50.102 - 00:15:17.780, Speaker B: It's what gives value to inclusion. It's what makes access actually worth something. Otherwise we would have just told all these people like, hey, follow us. We're taking you to the promised land. And then you get to the door and you finally have access and it's like, oh, yeah, by the way, you need to add your value into this pool and we'll give you this other token as a placeholder for now. And oh, by the way, you don't get to pick your interest rate. We do that for you as well.
00:15:17.780 - 00:15:39.980, Speaker B: One more thing, there's also these other large lenders that are involved in this pool and their presence is going to affect your return. So fixed rate lending to get to your question, breeds that freedom. It gives people that option. It gives people that sort of basis to build on top. That makes sense.
00:15:40.430 - 00:16:01.498, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, that's why we're doing this. In defi, in my opinion, I don't think all banks are equal, but I think they're not very transparent and people don't know why they have the rate they have. People don't understand what goes into it, but we can lay that out. Like, here's what is happening. Here's who is involved. Here's your lender, here's the rate they chose.
00:16:01.498 - 00:16:16.642, Speaker A: Choose it or don't. There you go. I love that. I have more questions, but our audience has a bunch of questions. And so I'm going to start talking here. Jumping in. We've got question about, and I will get to you guys.
00:16:16.642 - 00:16:34.140, Speaker A: Manuel, I see you guys, your questions here. You've also got a token. What does the token do? What are the incentives to hold it after you get rewarded by repaying a loan? And you did mention there's token burn as well. That's one of the things the protocol does, one of the things that differentiates you. But what's the utility here?
00:16:34.910 - 00:17:15.810, Speaker B: So the yield token is a utility token, right? It's baked into how the platform, it sort of undulates between being burned and minted. So in that sense, it's central to how platform operates, right. It's not just a token that you buy and hold and you hope goes up. So that's one thing. But that said, we do want to continue to incentivize people to use the platform, focusing on borrowers. So yeah, there is an opportunity to stake yield token. There's about 50 yield that you can stake, and that gives you the opportunity to take advantage of lower order lateralization percentages.
00:17:15.810 - 00:18:21.410, Speaker B: It also gives you the opportunity to take advantage of discount on the fees that are generated, charge that is charged by the platform. And I don't know the range of knowledge on lending in general viewers. So let me just talk a little bit about what over collateralization is. Lending in the traditional sense isn't really comparable to lending as it happens on the blockchain. So in the traditional sense, people have some kind of credit score that says, hey, you're a good lender, and then you get a loan from the bank, from whatever kind of institution, and ultimately you repay that loan and credit score goes up, down on the blockchain, given the pace. And again, that's something we talked about earlier, Andy, given the pace at which we're growing, there is a lot of volatility in the market that people want to take advantage of. And that is one side of the equation.
00:18:21.410 - 00:19:18.910, Speaker B: The other side of the equation is people are holding valuable assets, they're holding ethereum, all these different assets, and they don't necessarily want to sell. So over collateralization allows you to collateralize that asset, that you don't make it liquid, get some other value, some other token USDT, for instance, that you can use to trade profit, and then you can repay your loans. So that's what over collateralization is. You're locking up, for instance, with USDT, if you can use that as a collateral on our platform, I believe 120% over collateralization. So you're locking up $120 to be able to, if it's Ethereum, you're locking up. I believe it's $130 to obtain $125 of value. Sorry, $130 to be able to borrow $100 of value.
00:19:18.910 - 00:20:01.500, Speaker B: And I believe it's 135 for all the other. So those ratios get to be reduced if you state the 50 yield, that's what. And then as far as the discount is concerned, there's a 25% discount on the fees that we charge on interest. And then there's also a fee that we charge in India, likely event, fortunate event, that you're liquidated. In other words, your collateral is worth a lot less than those percentages that I mentioned. You get to reduce those percentages. So again, for a stable coin, it's reduced to 117 and a half percent.
00:20:01.500 - 00:20:12.830, Speaker B: I believe for Ethereum, it's reduced all the way down to 120%, and then for the others, it's reduced down to 130. And that reduction, that 25% reduction is valuable.
00:20:15.410 - 00:20:38.578, Speaker A: Yeah. I think users might be familiar with finance's centralized finance platform, how they use the BNB token for fees. If you have BNB token, you can opt to use BNB for fees and it gives you some kind of discount. So we've seen that model before. I don't know if I've seen it in lending personally. So that's a cool option there. Thank you, Mike, for that question.
00:20:38.578 - 00:21:00.682, Speaker A: Got another good question here. How does collection work or repayment work? There's not really collections if the borrower is past due. So how do the terms work for liquidations and all that? And you said liquidations are a sad event. I mean, that's just a reality of the industries. Liquidations are real. And if you are going to deal in lending, it's a possibility. You got to make sure and keep your loan collateralized.
00:21:00.682 - 00:21:04.034, Speaker A: Right? So how does this work, ant?
00:21:04.072 - 00:22:01.982, Speaker B: Do you want me to take this one? So nothing on the Ethereum blockchain is automatic. Like someone needs to actually do something, call something, claim something for an action to take place. So, in the lending space, and you see this with the other lending platforms as well, in the event that you've collateralized, say $130 of theory and you borrowed 100, but that value, or the value of Ethereum now decreases below that threshold, you are running the risk of getting liquidated. If that happens, either the lender or actors that we would call liquidators are able to essentially watch that smart contract and say, hey, I see this loan has actually gone below that ratio. And when that happens, that collateral is collected. So the collectors collect that collateral. It could be the lender himself.
00:22:01.982 - 00:22:29.100, Speaker B: Him or herself or it could be a third party. But when they do make that collection fee is charged, right. That's a liquidation fee, I believe, of 7%. Then that token is either sold and the value, if it's a third party that's collected it, that value is then given back to the lender. And in some cases the liquidator gets to keep an excess. If there is an excess, that's not always the case. So that's how collection and repayment works.
00:22:29.100 - 00:23:05.240, Speaker B: But if you're repaying your loan, sorry, if the time has elapsed on your loan, it's not necessarily the case that you're automatically liquidating. Right, that's what I meant by starting out by saying that nothing is automatic on the Ethereum blockchain. There's solutions out there like keeper, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that, that allows tasks, if you like, to be put out there that people can enter into or can do to make some money. Right. This would be a perfect example of how that particular solution could be.
00:23:05.690 - 00:23:36.530, Speaker A: Well, I'm going to talk to you later because we have chain link keepers now. It's a new product, so we'll talk more about that afterwards. But I exactly thought of that great question, thinking about how those liquidations take place. I've got a couple of other ones that are a little less on the specific borrowing protocol itself, but I got a question. People asking about other chain integrations, phantom or other blockchains, like what are your guys plans for L2 and blockchains? Are you moving anywhere or bridging anywhere?
00:23:38.070 - 00:24:32.820, Speaker C: I can add part of that. I think we want to come to that towards the end, won't we, tobe? So you will obviously see on the yield roadmap that it's on a short term roadmap, that it's on there for phantom timescales in this space. There isn't one on there, but it's obviously something on there. On the short term roadmap, we understand the need for it. I think we're actively looking into kind of yields operation sort of other blockchains as well. And I know that our lead dev coiner is looking at those various options. The community focus on L2 solutions as well, because the gas is super expensive right now, so issuer loans are costing lots and hence why that phantom piece is important.
00:24:32.820 - 00:24:52.010, Speaker C: V two, whilst we can't give you kind of details around it, because we don't want to lose out our sort of DNA, the platform would still be in the background, but there is so much that's kind of being worked on, respectively. You know, Toby, I think you agree that's going to be a game changer.
00:24:52.430 - 00:25:23.506, Speaker B: Yeah, it's always interesting, Andy, and maybe you can just share your views on this. Layer two solutions are their big hit. Over the past three to four months, they've done incredibly well. Like Phantom has done really well. Polygon, formerly matic, has done really well, and there are others out there. What they bring to the table is something that ethereum has just struggled to really just do. Right.
00:25:23.506 - 00:25:51.054, Speaker B: I'm not saying they won't do it eventually, but we need it now. And the L2 solutions are doing it. So Phantom is interesting. It's interesting because it's becoming a bit of, so to speak, a darling of Defi. There's a lot of platforms that have moved to Phantom and are utilizing this opportunity to transact at really just minimal fees. Right. I think I've seen transactions that were practically free, if you like.
00:25:51.054 - 00:26:23.302, Speaker B: So, Phantom, it's there. It's on our roadmap. We're going to do it. We're waiting for them to integrate. Once that happens, we're good to go. But yes, there's absolutely other L2 solutions that we're looking at as well. Why should we limit ourselves to theorem? I think we'll go into all these different places, we'll introduce yield on all these different platforms, and people can choose.
00:26:23.302 - 00:26:56.770, Speaker B: Right. If you're a polygon guy, then go ahead, use that blockchain. That's fine. One other thing that I just wanted to mention. I follow Andre on Twitter and I noticed one of his tweets where he. I think he started a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain and it got validated on Phantom. I might be saying this wrong or misunderstanding it, but it seemed very interesting to me that seemed like he was able to do something on Ethereum and have it validated on Phantom.
00:26:56.770 - 00:27:40.094, Speaker B: I'm saying this because maybe where we're going is not necessarily this strict division between blockchains. Like, you're over here and fees are always paid. This, and this is this other blockchain that is a completely different ecosystem and works in that way. It sounds like, and it looks like there's solutions that are coming, there's pieces to the equation that are being dreamt up, and it involves interacting with both blockchains at the same time, with multiple blockchains at the same time. So I look forward to those types of solutions. But for where we are today, we're on Ethereum. We're looking to move to L2.
00:27:40.094 - 00:27:47.970, Speaker B: Well, when I say move, we're looking to set up shopping L2 solutions as well. While still obviously running on the Ethereum blockchain.
00:27:48.630 - 00:28:15.900, Speaker A: What I'm seeing is developers don't like paying the fees either. If you want to innovate, if you want to build a new app, adapt and you want to test it and run it on main net, a little bit costs you hundreds of dollars. You can't do that sustainably from a small team. And it's different on testnet. It's just different. It's not the same users, it's not the same value, it's not real yet.
00:28:17.470 - 00:28:19.194, Speaker B: Sorry. Keep going, I'll let you finish.
00:28:19.232 - 00:28:48.278, Speaker A: First, the demand is there, and not just from the retail user side or the user side, it is there from the builder side. And when you build these things, you can't just build it all at once. Ethereum and all the money, legos under it and two other blockchains, they're individual components. They are getting scaled. Each little block is getting scaled and I'm seeing that, like right and left, you see little ones of these. It's coming. But also we've got to be sensitive of development schedules and let developers and engineers sleep a little bit once in a while.
00:28:48.278 - 00:28:52.390, Speaker A: Not too much, but a little bit part of your ecosystem.
00:28:53.130 - 00:29:55.340, Speaker B: You said that and sort of the hairs in the back of my neck went off and it strikes a chord with me. It strikes a chord with anyone that was involved with yield credit early on. And the reason is we're a community driven platform, right? There isn't a company, there isn't any sort of venture capitalist. We didn't raise any funds. There wasn't an ICO, there wasn't a public sale. There wasn't a private sale. This is all stuff that was built by handful of people that are still in the community, right? And that are involved with coming up with the ideas, testing the ideas, checking to see whether the smart contracts, verifying whether launching that contract, what it's going to cost, should we do it on this day? Should we do it on that day? How do we pull funds to make that happen? Antonio, are the ones sitting in front of you today, but there's a battery of people that have worked over the years, over the last two years to get us to where we are today.
00:29:55.340 - 00:30:32.646, Speaker B: For a small project like us for now, we expect to get bigger. For a small project like us for now, that has come from humble beginnings. Those fees, from a developer's perspective, they hurt. All that testing, it hurts and if you look at our roadmap, you'll see some of the smart contract optimizations that we're talking about. It all relates to fees. Right. We're spending so much time rethinking how the coding works just to make sure that it doesn't cost too much to put up an offer.
00:30:32.646 - 00:30:57.600, Speaker B: Right. Just to make sure that the guy who wants to lend $500 can actually do so and not actually lose money by the time she or he has put up an offer and has finally received the interest and is now taking their cash. It's all counterproductive when you're dealing with those types of dollars. So that's a great focus of ours. It's something that we want to improve on, and it's one of the reasons we'll always look at.
00:30:59.970 - 00:31:26.582, Speaker C: I think it's really important to kind of alluded to our history. There are a lot of people in the background that have kind of been working away at it, and Tobe and I have had been fortunate enough to be the ones that kind of be involved in testing and seeing a project start from the ground up. I think, Toby, when we were in the initial group, there was, what, less than 50 of us?
00:31:26.716 - 00:31:28.760, Speaker B: 40 50 of us, something like that.
00:31:29.530 - 00:31:39.990, Speaker C: That's special to be involved in a project that early, earlier on, and seeing those same people at the beginning still around now, it's almost like your own little family.
00:31:40.160 - 00:31:40.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:43.730 - 00:32:04.178, Speaker A: I have helped do technical writing and documentation for various things. Just imagine. So you've got a d five vault protocol, and you got to take a screenshot of it. You're not even developing it. You got to take a screenshot of it, of a deposit so that you can write, explain how to do it. Well, that means you got to make a deposit. And if you got to make a deposit, there's $50.
00:32:04.178 - 00:32:26.826, Speaker A: And then, oh, we got to authorize it. So there's $20, and then you got to withdraw it because you got to do the same thing for another vault. You're up to $150 for a screenshot, like, a couple of screenshots. And that's just on the instructions, let alone on the actual testing. It's just a reality. But the other side of that coin is it's coming. Those solutions are coming, and everybody cares about it.
00:32:26.826 - 00:32:34.494, Speaker A: Everybody's working on it. We had a great insight into your team and beginnings and where you guys are going. We're running on time a little bit.
00:32:34.532 - 00:32:35.120, Speaker C: So.
00:32:37.410 - 00:32:59.250, Speaker A: To the audience, I'm sorry we couldn't get to your questions. The good news for our viewers, there are communities that you can join and ask these very questions to these very people. Can you guys tell us where can people go? What are the next steps that our viewers, we had a ton of viewers, by the way. This is fantastic. I love having this many people in here live and your questions are fantastic.
00:32:59.330 - 00:33:01.110, Speaker B: It must be because of COVID.
00:33:03.850 - 00:33:07.174, Speaker A: I don't know. I think you're onto something.
00:33:07.292 - 00:33:08.646, Speaker B: I think so too.
00:33:08.828 - 00:33:15.100, Speaker A: But what are some sort of next steps? What can people take to get more involved in yield credit and learn more about what you guys are doing?
00:33:17.070 - 00:34:08.650, Speaker B: So maybe an announcement is a good time to give the people an announcement. We're launching a podcast. Ant and I are launching a podcast. It's going to be called Agents of Youth. Our goal is to have conversations with projects looking to add utility to their token that are looking to list on our platform. And the idea is to talk to them about what does this new utility for your token mean for you? What advantages will it give you? How do you see yourself fitting into Defi? And have you thought through that? And that's from the perspective of a developer, a developer that's looking to add utility to a specific token for the, I'd call them average listeners. It's also important to understand what leverage is like.
00:34:08.650 - 00:34:42.886, Speaker B: How can you use leverage in a healthy way, in a responsible way to boost your return? So we'll be talking through that as well. So please join us, join the community. We would be happy to talk you through whatever questions you may have, show you how the works. There's a good amount of negotiation that happens on telegram, in and around interest rates. People don't want to pay those fees offer. So they come into telegram and they say, oh, I want to borrow $20,000 at 4% and someone says, oh, 3.5. And it kind of goes there.
00:34:42.886 - 00:35:03.630, Speaker B: Then they agree and then that offer comes up. Right? There's a little bit of that happening as well. We're a happy bunch. You can find us on Telegram, Twitter. Ant and I will add the website podcast, which will be soon. The next couple of. We have really good and interesting guests lined up for the first few episodes.
00:35:03.630 - 00:35:10.270, Speaker B: So yeah, you can look forward to that. Agents of yield should be a fun little thing.
00:35:10.420 - 00:35:14.642, Speaker C: Don't forget you told me we've got a Discord channel as well for agents.
00:35:14.696 - 00:35:46.530, Speaker A: Yield, sorry, yield credit so people can join the discord, people can join the telegram, and there's a podcast coming. I just got agents of yield reference. You told to me earlier and now I'm like, oh, that's a lot of fun. This has been really great digging into your project and your protocol, how it came about, meeting you guys. Really sharp team and I appreciate you coming on to the audience. I appreciate you coming on as well. I'm going to drop all of the links they just mentioned into the YouTube description.
00:35:46.530 - 00:36:08.622, Speaker A: So as you go and share this video, please feel free to come back and reference this a video, share it with your friends, like and subscribe. Help me out with this chainlink YouTube channel and join me for other chainlink live events. Thank you, Mark, who's helping out in the chat. I always appreciate you. And again, tove aunt, thanks for coming on. This has been chain link live.
00:36:08.756 - 00:36:09.086, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:36:09.108 - 00:36:10.510, Speaker C: Thanks very much for having us.
00:36:10.660 - 00:36:11.806, Speaker A: All right. Thanks, guys.
00:36:11.908 - 00:36:12.940, Speaker C: Cheers, guys. Take care.
