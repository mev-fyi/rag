00:00:04.410 - 00:00:36.200, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Chainlink Ethereum merge watch party. We are all here. We are all very excited. We thought that we'd be merging right now, but it looks like we've still got a little bit of time left. But we thought we'd go live anyway and say hi to everybody, read, chat, watch what's happening with the merge, and really just talk about what's going on in crypto right now. Why don't we go around and do introductions? So let's start top left. Harry, why don't you introduce yourself?
00:00:36.570 - 00:00:45.180, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. My name is Harry. I'm a developer advocate manager at Chainlink Labs here, and I'm ultra excited for the merge today.
00:00:47.790 - 00:00:49.462, Speaker A: Let's jump to Zubin.
00:00:49.606 - 00:00:58.640, Speaker C: Hey, guys, I'm Zubin. Zubin Pratap here, based in Australia and also developer advocate here at Chainlink Labs. And super, super excited to be with everybody here today.
00:01:02.370 - 00:01:04.430, Speaker A: Harry, you're up. Patrick, you're.
00:01:06.390 - 00:01:07.186, Speaker D: Up, everybody.
00:01:07.288 - 00:01:08.370, Speaker A: No introduction.
00:01:09.510 - 00:01:28.440, Speaker D: That's not true. My name is Patrick Collins. I'm a developer advocate on the Chainlink project, and I'm mildly delirious right now, so this is good. Patrick needs some sleep. Vitalik needs to hurry up and do the merging. But yeah, that's me.
00:01:29.290 - 00:01:30.550, Speaker A: All right, Andre.
00:01:31.130 - 00:01:48.880, Speaker E: Yeah, gm jam. My name is Andre, and you can see by the position of the sun and my morning coffee that I'm based in Europe, so I can be here basically the whole day until the merge happens. So, yeah, happy to be and chat with you today, guys. Off to you, Frank, I think.
00:01:50.290 - 00:02:11.160, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. My name is Frank, Frank Kong. I'm also a developer advocate in training lab and my job is for the chinese developer community. I don't know if any chinese developer come today because I published this link yesterday and for now it's up to for me. So I'm good with.
00:02:13.930 - 00:02:38.494, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. And my name is Stephen Fluan and I am the head of devo relations here at Chainlink Labs. So maybe one of the first things to talk about here is what time do we think this is actually going to happen? I know a lot of us are on Bordell. WTF? Some people, I was on a bunch of miners websites, they have their own countdowns. Google has a countdown. What does Google's countdown say right now?
00:02:38.692 - 00:02:57.334, Speaker B: I think Google's is about half an hour behind Bordell. Yeah. It's not the easiest thing to predict. Right. Because you've got the total difficulty that we need to reach and that kind of changes as miners come and go.
00:02:57.372 - 00:03:11.820, Speaker A: From the network yes, you've got Bordell says 641 UTC, which is in 40 minutes from now. But it keeps shifting. It keeps sliding as we've seen.
00:03:15.710 - 00:03:19.818, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's at least 35 minutes.
00:03:19.904 - 00:03:20.202, Speaker F: Right.
00:03:20.256 - 00:03:25.680, Speaker B: But we don't know. It could be a lot after that even, too.
00:03:26.930 - 00:03:39.060, Speaker A: Why is the time slipping? Because the hash rate hasn't seemed to change for the last few hours. So I would think that if the hash rate isn't changing, the difficulty should be where they predicted it.
00:03:40.230 - 00:03:43.140, Speaker B: That's a great question. Does anyone else have any idea?
00:03:45.190 - 00:03:57.320, Speaker C: I saw one of the comments, somebody said that miners are turning off the nodes. I don't know if that's true or not, but if somebody did say that in the comments and you have some resources to link to, that would be really great to see.
00:03:58.890 - 00:04:32.180, Speaker D: Vitalik just wants to keep the suspense going as long as he. Yeah, so he's running around to every node operator and being like, slow down. He's got like little crossing guard vest on telling the nodes to reduce their difficulty. Guys, I'm losing it. This stream is going to be just delirious chat. And then if something does break, I will put my rear in gear and get down to my ETH node and do damage control. Hopefully that doesn't happen, but right now that's where the mental state is.
00:04:32.870 - 00:04:45.560, Speaker B: I'll see a comment from the chat here. It'd be cool to mine the last ETH block, and equally cool would be to mine the first block on the beacon chain. Post the merge as well.
00:04:47.610 - 00:04:52.620, Speaker A: Would you put something special in it? Like would you insert a special transaction that's like, hi mom.
00:04:53.310 - 00:05:13.360, Speaker B: There's a graffiti you can set on the transactions for Ethereum, two validators, but it's limited to 32 bytes, I think. So there's only like a certain amount of stuff you can put in. So it'll be interesting to see what the very first graffiti is against the post merge Ethereum world.
00:05:13.970 - 00:05:21.890, Speaker A: And where should people go to look at graffiti from blocks that have been mined? It's not something I see on like ether scan when I look at a block.
00:05:22.550 - 00:05:41.660, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So post in the chat and I'll try share my screen here. So beaconchat in is the explorer that I use. I think there's a couple to look at. The Ethereum two network. How do I share my screen here? Share. There we go.
00:05:41.660 - 00:05:52.560, Speaker B: So as you can see, we've got blocks here. Let's see if we can find one.
00:05:53.730 - 00:05:55.920, Speaker C: Harry, could you zoom in a little bit?
00:05:57.730 - 00:06:20.040, Speaker B: Thanks. So here's the epoch which is just the number of slots. And where is the graffiti now?
00:06:23.690 - 00:06:24.774, Speaker D: While he's looking that up?
00:06:24.812 - 00:06:26.162, Speaker B: Here it is. Graffiti.
00:06:26.306 - 00:06:26.950, Speaker D: Oh, nice.
00:06:27.020 - 00:06:32.042, Speaker B: So this one was done by Teku version 22.9.0.
00:06:32.096 - 00:06:52.802, Speaker D: Teku. Also, everyone who's here and in the chat, how many of you are running ETH nodes? How many of you are, like, ready? All hands on deck, ready to come in and swoop in and fix whatever needs to be fixed. Who here is running an ethereum node? Ready for the merge? Who's doing that?
00:06:52.856 - 00:06:54.420, Speaker B: Yeah, let us know.
00:06:58.550 - 00:07:04.874, Speaker D: Soul's here, too. What up, soul? Is that popcorn?
00:07:04.942 - 00:07:05.942, Speaker B: Getting the popcorn ready.
00:07:05.996 - 00:07:06.690, Speaker D: That's brilliant.
00:07:06.770 - 00:07:10.760, Speaker C: Steven's really damaged. He's getting seriously ready.
00:07:12.090 - 00:07:14.310, Speaker F: And I have the panda.
00:07:16.010 - 00:07:26.330, Speaker D: Someone's bingo card just got checked off by having that panda. We got a ninja turtle in the chat. Got his ready. Love it. Excellent.
00:07:26.990 - 00:07:39.680, Speaker F: And so funny that I was in the spanish party and both are showing the same site, the same explanation. So this is so nice.
00:07:43.510 - 00:08:01.800, Speaker B: Yeah. So what we're looking at here is we're waiting for the total difficulty of the current chain to reach this number here, which is basically here. So once the green meets the red, then it's game on and the merge is going to instantly happen.
00:08:03.610 - 00:08:20.894, Speaker D: All right, are we taking bets then? I feel like that's what we got to do. We got to make some bets, code the agreement in a smart contract on when it's going to happen. Oh, wait, was there a prediction market for this? I bet you there was probably a prediction market for this. Did anyone see anything about that that might have been really?
00:08:20.932 - 00:08:23.120, Speaker A: Yeah, there was actually one on Bordell, I think.
00:08:23.730 - 00:08:24.720, Speaker D: Oh, really?
00:08:26.610 - 00:08:27.262, Speaker B: Where? Sorry.
00:08:27.316 - 00:08:30.000, Speaker E: We can code another one alive right now.
00:08:31.730 - 00:08:37.860, Speaker D: We could, right. We would just have to do like block difficulty and look for that specific number, see if it's greater or less than.
00:08:39.030 - 00:08:48.790, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a great question in the chat here. Does someone want to try answer. What if exactly during the merge, some transaction is submitted to the proof of work chain rather than the beacon chain?
00:08:49.770 - 00:09:14.320, Speaker F: Yes. In fact, the transaction, it's submitted to the same place. But what defines this is the block number. So if you try to add this in the block number, that's proof of work or proof of stake. This is the difference. Am I right?
00:09:15.970 - 00:09:33.380, Speaker D: I think that's definitely part of it. Right? Yeah. The proof of work chain has its own chain ID, but you'd also need to send it to the correct chain. Right. So the proof of work or the proof of chain node with the right chain ID, and then obviously with the transaction history.
00:09:33.750 - 00:09:46.680, Speaker F: Yes. But the chain ID, you not change for us? What's that like? If you use the chain ID from itino Mainnet, it's supposed to be the same.
00:09:47.130 - 00:10:04.000, Speaker A: It totally depends on the miners. Right. So if the miners have hard forked and changed the chain ID, then they'll only accept transactions for that chain ID. Right. If they didn't implement, what is it, the Paris hard fork, then they'll still have the old chain ID, right?
00:10:05.090 - 00:10:08.640, Speaker D: Yeah. Yes.
00:10:09.970 - 00:10:20.402, Speaker A: So it depends. What do we know about the proof of work chain? I saw some rumblings. I didn't see anything like formal or official coming out from that group.
00:10:20.536 - 00:10:37.160, Speaker F: I saw yesterday that they created a Twitter account and they are telling that one day after the merge, the other chain will be live.
00:10:42.350 - 00:10:47.420, Speaker B: Oh, wow. So within 24 hours, they're going to have their own new proof of work chain running.
00:10:48.430 - 00:10:49.180, Speaker F: Yes.
00:10:50.350 - 00:10:51.100, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:10:52.110 - 00:11:09.010, Speaker A: Wait. Okay. Did they implement their own Paris hard fork alternative as of the peak difficulty, it's their own chain. Or are they just going to wait and see what happens and then create a hard fork?
00:11:09.510 - 00:11:13.460, Speaker F: Yes. The idea is to change the diff code again.
00:11:14.870 - 00:11:25.720, Speaker B: Yeah. So they're implementing their own code that not only reverses what was done for Paris hard fork, but then has their own logic to say, hey, this is business as usual. Now.
00:11:27.450 - 00:11:31.210, Speaker A: Do we know how many miners are, like, running that version of the node?
00:11:32.270 - 00:11:35.626, Speaker B: I do not know. Does anyone else have any links or.
00:11:35.648 - 00:11:44.330, Speaker F: Anything they want to show with nodes? Ethernodes has some iOS falling.
00:11:45.870 - 00:11:49.998, Speaker B: Steven, someone's asking what flavor your popcorn is.
00:11:50.084 - 00:11:51.742, Speaker D: Important question. Thank you for that.
00:11:51.796 - 00:11:56.750, Speaker A: Buttered and salted, but not caramel. I can't do caramel corn. It's too sweet.
00:11:59.490 - 00:12:04.514, Speaker D: Stephen, that was the right play, my friend. Now I'm wishing I had popcorn here.
00:12:04.632 - 00:12:10.200, Speaker A: See? But you need popcorn in 40 minutes from now. I'm way too early. This is way off.
00:12:12.170 - 00:12:20.118, Speaker D: Do you eat your popcorn at the climax of the movie or, like, at the beginning? I feel like we're at the beginning of the movie. I feel like you've chosen the correct time.
00:12:20.284 - 00:12:38.654, Speaker A: We're going to have the same phenomenon in offices where one person makes popcorn and it makes other people like, you smell popcorn and you're like, oh, I should make some popcorn. And so no one will have popcorn for months, and then one day, everyone will just like, popcorn, popcorn, popcorn, popcorn. Let's get it going. Let's get the popcorn chain going.
00:12:38.772 - 00:12:52.638, Speaker D: So here's the disadvantage of remote. If we were in the same office, I could go over and steal some of your popcorn. But we're not. So that popcorn's all yours. But if you don't finish it, I'm.
00:12:52.654 - 00:12:56.694, Speaker A: Sure someone else has popcorn in their house. I can mail you some. I was there.
00:12:56.812 - 00:13:12.742, Speaker D: How to say if you don't finish it, Steven, feel free to mail it to me. I will gladly eat your leftover popcorn. Where can we get these chain links?
00:13:12.886 - 00:13:15.738, Speaker A: The green bar moved. Did you see it?
00:13:15.824 - 00:13:17.494, Speaker D: I think it moved one or two pixels.
00:13:17.542 - 00:13:18.650, Speaker A: It was so exciting.
00:13:18.990 - 00:13:20.422, Speaker B: Did it go down or up?
00:13:20.496 - 00:13:21.840, Speaker D: I think it went down.
00:13:22.690 - 00:13:24.720, Speaker C: I think it went down. Yeah.
00:13:27.570 - 00:13:29.120, Speaker D: I'm dying, guys.
00:13:30.610 - 00:13:37.010, Speaker F: Hey, what time is for you? For me? 03:00 a.m., oh, my goodness.
00:13:38.950 - 00:13:43.700, Speaker B: Talik must be in Australia or something because it's like afternoon australian time.
00:13:44.970 - 00:13:50.280, Speaker C: I think we need a total difficulty chart for Patrick and soul as well.
00:13:52.410 - 00:13:55.954, Speaker F: And Andrew, did you wake up for the UE?
00:13:56.002 - 00:14:11.550, Speaker E: Yeah. It's 08:15 a.m. At my place. So I woke up slightly before 06:00 a.m. To wait for the merge. And I still didn't have my breakfast, so maybe I started to get hungry. So maybe I'll drop off to grab something.
00:14:11.550 - 00:14:14.414, Speaker E: I'm still drinking my morning coffee, but yeah.
00:14:14.612 - 00:14:16.560, Speaker D: All right. Breaking news.
00:14:17.410 - 00:14:21.358, Speaker E: Yeah, the merge is european friendly. European time friendly, I guess.
00:14:21.524 - 00:14:32.594, Speaker D: And breaking news, borl, WTF? Just dropped below 30 minutes, so that's a good sign. I'm about it.
00:14:32.792 - 00:14:40.150, Speaker A: Be funny if the prediction was wrong and it happened like ten minutes ago and none of us noticed, we're all just like sitting.
00:14:42.410 - 00:14:43.830, Speaker D: That's really funny.
00:14:45.050 - 00:14:51.580, Speaker A: Could you pull up your node, your beacon chain, and watch the transactions going through it?
00:14:52.750 - 00:14:55.500, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, I'm going to do that actually.
00:14:55.950 - 00:15:01.310, Speaker A: I think that would be cool because then we don't have to trust. Let's find some truth.
00:15:01.730 - 00:15:10.590, Speaker D: Yeah, good point. Well, I don't want to share my screen though, because I don't know what is in the logs.
00:15:11.410 - 00:15:15.586, Speaker B: The beacon chain logs are okay. It's the validator logs you don't want to show.
00:15:15.688 - 00:15:16.580, Speaker D: Oh, really?
00:15:16.950 - 00:15:20.466, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll share mine quickly.
00:15:20.648 - 00:15:32.710, Speaker D: Wait, it's the validator logs. So if you're running Teku, what are you running for your consensus client?
00:15:35.130 - 00:15:36.630, Speaker B: I'm running prism.
00:15:40.890 - 00:15:44.250, Speaker D: Ah, I guess those are logs.
00:15:45.230 - 00:16:14.286, Speaker B: So this top window here, I don't know how much you guys can see, is the, that doesn't work. The top window is the Ethereum execution client. In this case, it's nevermind. So this is pulling in block information from the current proof of work chain. And the second one is the beacon chain or consensus client. Which in this case is prism. And you can see it's adding to the beacon chain.
00:16:14.286 - 00:16:21.298, Speaker B: And it's saying this ready for the merge message all the time because it's like ready to go for when that difficulty gets reached.
00:16:21.394 - 00:16:28.120, Speaker D: Wait, was that your Teku logs? What logs were your prism logs? What logs are those?
00:16:28.970 - 00:16:35.562, Speaker B: This second window is the logs for the beacon chain prism logs, but it's not the log for the validator itself.
00:16:35.696 - 00:16:39.050, Speaker D: Where are the logs for the validator? Wouldn't that be your prism node?
00:16:41.230 - 00:16:44.460, Speaker A: Can you zoom in on a couple of those or maximize another window? Yes.
00:16:45.410 - 00:16:53.774, Speaker B: How do I zoom in? I've got another terminal window open, but it's minimized for the validator.
00:16:53.902 - 00:16:59.186, Speaker D: Wait, is your validator not your prism? Why am I being confused here?
00:16:59.288 - 00:17:03.934, Speaker B: Prism has two separate sessions, two separate programs.
00:17:04.062 - 00:17:04.786, Speaker E: Got it.
00:17:04.888 - 00:17:09.538, Speaker C: Yeah. Prism has two different clients. One's for the validation and one's for the consensus.
00:17:09.634 - 00:17:14.950, Speaker D: Oh, interesting tech is just one client.
00:17:15.450 - 00:17:22.902, Speaker B: Okay, prism splits it out to two separate processes because you need to deposit your ETH.
00:17:23.046 - 00:17:27.180, Speaker C: Yeah, to run the validator, but you need to deposit the ETH, and not everyone wants to do that.
00:17:28.510 - 00:17:35.226, Speaker B: Beacon chain is checking the latest difficulty here, and it's comparing it to the terminal difficulty.
00:17:35.418 - 00:17:56.230, Speaker D: Got it. And then it looks like in the Teku logs, it tells me the attestation that I make. So, yeah, I wouldn't want to share these. I mean, it's not like a security thing, but then you could identify which validator was mine, and I wouldn't love that. Sorry, peeps. Looking for the alpha in the chat?
00:17:58.010 - 00:18:14.426, Speaker A: We actually have a few questions. Maybe we can take a swing at answering some of these. So what's the merge mean? Who wants to jump in? It's on screen too, but yeah, don't read from that.
00:18:14.448 - 00:18:16.380, Speaker C: I was just going to say, yeah.
00:18:17.550 - 00:18:19.370, Speaker B: He'S only preferred earlier.
00:18:20.370 - 00:19:10.140, Speaker A: For me, it's all about the shift from proof of work to proof of stake, right? Right. Now there are, what is it, 800,000,030 90 equivalents running around the world like 30 90 or Nvidia 30 90 graphics cards because 30 90 is like 100 mega hashes per second. And so there's 849 terrahashes, I think it's 849,000,000 graphics cards equivalent compute power going into the proof of work chain. Someone check my math on that one. But that's like, as a huge amount of work going to verifying and securing the ethereum network and all of that just disappears. All of that proof of work is no longer needed. The moment the merge happens.
00:19:10.140 - 00:19:28.020, Speaker A: Someone was thinking like, oh, there's going to be a ramped on. I'm like, no, this block that happens on the main Ethereum chain, the mining doesn't matter, there is no difficulty. Right. It's all based on the proof of stake, it's based on how much ETH have you staked, how many validators do you have? All that?
00:19:28.470 - 00:19:29.570, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%.
00:19:29.640 - 00:19:29.970, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:30.040 - 00:20:03.118, Speaker B: And the actual rollout is actually a multistage process. And this is stage two of two, if you will. So am I still sharing my screen? Yeah. So this diagram here kind of shows it really well. So up until recently, we were running the proof of work chain and miners would run a client such as Geth or something like that. And then in December 2020, we launched, or Ethereum launched, what was called the Beacon chain, which is for the proof of stake Ethereum network. So initially, the beacon chain has been just running since December 2020.
00:20:03.118 - 00:20:59.742, Speaker B: And all it really does, other than that proof of state consensus mechanism between all the validators, is it just kind of checks the balances of each validator and whether they're active or not. So that's the state of the beacon chain. There's no smart contracts, there's no anything like that being stored there. So that's stage one of the merge, to run those two things together in parallel so we can kind of see how everything's looking, everything's going, and kind of leave the actual shift to another date. So that's what today is. So what's going to happen today is when the total block difficulty reaches that predefined number. Both of the clients, the ethereum one clients, such as geth, plus the Ethereum two clients, whether it's Teku or prism, they both have code in them to say, hey, when the total difficulty reaches this, let's shift to this new logic instead.
00:20:59.742 - 00:21:36.650, Speaker B: And that new logic is basically that there's no more mining done on the Ethereum one clients, and they become just purely an execution client to process smart contracts and transactions and stuff like that. And then the beacon chain and the validators become basically the new consensus mechanism for everything, right? So the old chain stops, and then going forward, proof of stake with the beacon chain as your kind of consensus layer, and then the ethereum one clients, such as your guests, your netherminds as your execution layer.
00:21:40.690 - 00:22:11.122, Speaker A: Sounds good to me. So maybe a connected question is the merge affects the traditional tutorials and documentation of Ethereum. Do we have to update our applications? Depending. So if everything goes right, no one should have to do anything. Right. It'll just magically work. If, I don't know, the nodes on the network, if not enough nodes agree to the hard fork, things like that, you might have mixed consensus, you might have challenges and things like that where you have block reorganizations.
00:22:11.122 - 00:22:28.780, Speaker A: There might be things that go wrong. We don't actually know. Right. This is, in my mind, the biggest change that has ever happened in crypto. Right. Like this moment in time. If I look back over the last even decade, there has never been a network with this scale in operation that has undergone a hard fork like this.
00:22:28.780 - 00:22:32.538, Speaker A: Live watch parties.
00:22:32.714 - 00:23:02.520, Speaker B: Yeah. And even outside crypto, just if you think of it as it software upgrades, the amount of value in Ethereum right now and what's being done to it is probably up there with the most, I won't call it high risk, but high value it software upgrades in history as well, because you've got something that's worth so much money, that's securing so much money, that's having this major change done just instantly like that. So it's kind of never been done before.
00:23:04.810 - 00:23:13.500, Speaker A: Yes. A lot of these systems will go down for a few hours for maintenance. Right. But Ethereum can only go down for 14 seconds until the next block is due. Right?
00:23:14.110 - 00:23:18.220, Speaker B: Yeah. We can't pause the chain. There's no pause button.
00:23:21.310 - 00:23:50.390, Speaker A: We also had a question, what's coming next for Chainlink? And I think someone else in the chat said it, but I think that one of the biggest things that's coming this month for Chainlink is Smartcon. So that is an event we're putting on in New York at the end of the month. We've got tons of developer workshops. We've got a whole developer workshop day. We've got a main conference where we've got, I think it's like hundreds of speakers at this point, and then a hacker house on the Friday. So lots and lots of fun going to be happening at Smartcon.
00:23:53.610 - 00:24:01.718, Speaker B: I just shared the website in the chat for anyone that's interested. Awesome.
00:24:01.804 - 00:24:15.550, Speaker A: Click on it. Is that it, smartcon, chain link. There it is. All right. And then I think there were some other questions. So the merge is happening to have more validators.
00:24:18.050 - 00:25:16.370, Speaker B: So the merge isn't happening to have more validators per se. The merge is occurring so that validators now control the consensus of the network. So if you go to the beacon chain explorer that I shared earlier at Beaconchainchad in and go to validators, you can see that there is now where's the number? There should be a number somewhere. 428,309 validators currently running processing beacon chain blocks, and each of them has 32 e staked as part of the process of onboarding to become a validator. So going forward, they will be the ones responsible for creating blocks and maintaining the consensus of the network. And anyone running the old proof of work protocols, like Gath, et cetera, that they will no longer be mining and creating blocks.
00:25:16.950 - 00:25:33.240, Speaker A: And that number can be a little misleading, though, right? Because there's far fewer than 400,000. I'll call it maybe teams, organizations, centers of authority running those, right? I'm sure a lot of those nodes are run by the same people.
00:25:33.610 - 00:25:53.966, Speaker B: Yeah. The political decentralization is not one to one. So you might have an exchange that's holding like, 500,000 ETH, and they're running x number of validators, one validator per 32 ETH they have. So even though it's multiple validators in this 128K number, it could be just one entity that's kind of controlling them.
00:25:53.988 - 00:26:00.160, Speaker F: Or in charge of them who can talk about Bellatrix. That happened one week ago.
00:26:03.090 - 00:26:31.050, Speaker B: Bellatrix upgrade. My understanding of Bellatrix was it was a fork to the network on both the consensus and the execution clients to prepare for the merge. So they had code put in, it wasn't backwards compatible, and it basically just prepared them so that when this block difficulty comes, the merge occurs. That's my understanding.
00:26:33.870 - 00:26:35.260, Speaker F: Yes. This is great.
00:26:36.590 - 00:27:02.980, Speaker E: Maybe the connected question to the previous one. So you, Harry, shared your screen, and you showed us basically that you're currently running two different instances. So one is like execution client, and the other one is consensus client. So to become a validator, you need to run both. But what if you want to become like a regular user on the Ethereum after the merge? Do you still need to run both of the clients or just the execution one?
00:27:03.350 - 00:27:05.410, Speaker B: What do you mean by a regular user?
00:27:06.650 - 00:27:24.442, Speaker E: I mean, I want to be a user of, let's say, some decentralized app, and I don't want to use, like infura or alchemy or whatever, RPC provider, but I'm not like a validator. They'll still need to run both clients, or I can just run execution one.
00:27:24.576 - 00:27:27.126, Speaker D: That's a great question, Patrick.
00:27:27.158 - 00:27:28.186, Speaker B: Did you want to take it?
00:27:28.288 - 00:27:31.740, Speaker D: I actually don't know. I think you do have to run both.
00:27:32.510 - 00:27:36.140, Speaker A: Yeah, you do have to run the.
00:27:36.850 - 00:27:37.694, Speaker B: Sorry, go ahead.
00:27:37.732 - 00:27:46.186, Speaker D: I was just going to say to me, it wouldn't feel like it would make sense if you can send a transaction to just one or the other.
00:27:46.228 - 00:27:46.434, Speaker A: Right?
00:27:46.472 - 00:27:53.134, Speaker D: Like, you need to execute the transaction on the execution layer, and then it needs to reach consensus on the consensus layer.
00:27:53.262 - 00:28:03.030, Speaker A: Why not? Because you don't have to mine a block to create a transaction. All you need is a node to create a transaction in the mempool.
00:28:03.370 - 00:28:39.394, Speaker B: Well, it's a multi stage rollout, and maybe in the future it will all be consolidated into one client. But as part of this stage of the rollout, yes, you do need the two separate clients running your legacy or ethereum. One execution layer clients client is the one that gets all the transactions, et cetera. The beacon chain client talks to the execution layer client, they're talking to each other, and the beacon chain then kind of does the consensus and everything. So for now, yeah, you definitely need to run both if you want to run a full node yourself.
00:28:39.592 - 00:29:01.990, Speaker C: Yes, I could be wrong, but I think there's an interprocess communication piece between the execution layer and the beacon chain layer. That has to happen, and that's why you need to have both running, is so that they can communicate on your machine on the local node before, and then the actual processing synchronization is parallel, but the first IPC communication is on your machine.
00:29:02.330 - 00:29:05.242, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's 100% right.
00:29:05.376 - 00:29:34.034, Speaker A: And we've got a bunch of questions that we'll maybe knock out. So how is the contracts deployed as of yesterday? Don't have to be redeployed after the merge. It's still the same blockchain, right? Every new block that is created is still based on the blocks that came yesterday. Even in the case of a hard fork, where Ethereum proof of work becomes a new chain, it will still have an identical history to the Ethereum main net.
00:29:34.232 - 00:29:40.600, Speaker C: So I guess another way of looking at that, Stephen, is that Us blocks are immutable anywhere. So nothing really changes in that sense.
00:29:41.050 - 00:30:03.630, Speaker A: So if you deploy a smart contract now, it will still exist no matter what happens. Yeah, a few other ones. Ethereum's merging with bitcoin. No, completely different chains. This has nothing to do with bitcoin. What else we got? How does proof of stake protecting and centralized forces such as centralized exchanges.
00:30:10.450 - 00:30:49.830, Speaker F: One of the points related to this is related to countries that are doing some kind of censorship to nodes, for example. And in fact, the centralized exchange, some of them used to have or to use infrastructure like in Fura, so it's not the centralized exchange. This is not the problem. What do you think about it?
00:30:50.280 - 00:31:03.784, Speaker D: So I got to jump off, I got to go talk to a couple of node apps. But if I don't see you all. Happy merge day. Congratulations. We made it really exciting here.
00:31:03.902 - 00:31:05.450, Speaker A: We're not there yet. We'll see.
00:31:08.300 - 00:31:09.050, Speaker B: You.
00:31:11.200 - 00:31:12.764, Speaker D: I just drinks it.
00:31:12.962 - 00:31:14.380, Speaker A: I'm always a skeptic.
00:31:14.800 - 00:31:26.316, Speaker D: Well, hopefully it goes well. Happy merge day. And if it goes poorly, then maybe Owal will still be here in a little. Yeah, bye.
00:31:26.348 - 00:31:27.010, Speaker B: All for.
00:31:30.580 - 00:32:21.430, Speaker A: So I'll respond a little bit to the question or the kind of building on what you just said. There aren't perfect protections in these ecosystems. If you look at proof of stake or proof of work, we're proof of work right this moment. If you showed up with more than 700 terrahashes a second, which theoretically you could do, if you had enough money, you would be able to create, probabilistically create the new consensus. Right? And so the same thing is true with proof of stake, where if you had more ETH than anyone else because you were somehow able to buy it, you could control the consensus. But the idea is that the more people that participate in this, the more decentralized it's going to be and the more protected it's going to be.
00:32:23.960 - 00:33:21.220, Speaker F: Yeah, exactly. One interesting point that was discussed today in another present in person meeting that I was is something related to what happened if they put a bump like in a minor center because you have the machines over there. But we are talking about the difference between have on site with miners and to have more decentralization. Even if you have your node in a cloud, for example, that you don't have any work, any effort with the machines to change from one cloud system to another, for example, this is another facility of decentralization.
00:33:26.440 - 00:33:27.190, Speaker A: It.
00:33:27.980 - 00:33:32.360, Speaker B: Is it just me or is this site now missing the prediction?
00:33:34.140 - 00:33:38.510, Speaker A: Did it happen? Check your node, Harry. Yeah, it's not for me too.
00:33:39.760 - 00:33:44.430, Speaker B: Says ready for the merge still, and we are apparently 36 blocks away.
00:33:45.040 - 00:33:51.490, Speaker A: Google says nine minutes. Bordell says stop saying, let's check a couple of others.
00:33:52.260 - 00:34:48.272, Speaker B: I think Bordell was a bit optimistic. I might just quickly take a minute to talk about what we expect to happen or what we should check once the merge happens, seeing as it's kind of closing in now. So like I said before, the transition will occur when the total difficulty reaches the total terminal total difficulty value. And the point at which we consider things good and safe and a success is basically about 13 to 15 minutes after this point, right? Because the network Finality on the beacon chain is reached after two epochs. Where are we here? After two epochs are confirmed by at least two thirds of active validators. And basically, I think an epoch is a set of 32. Sorry.
00:34:48.272 - 00:35:20.364, Speaker B: An epoch is a period of time, 6.4 minutes, divided into twelve second intervals. So if we start seeing blocks on the beacon chain here produced, and. Sorry, if we get two epochs finalized here after the merge kind of cut off point, we can consider that as pretty much a perfect success without any forks or anything holding things up. So the approximate time for that should be 13 to 15 minutes, the time you come back.
00:35:20.402 - 00:35:22.270, Speaker F: And now it's seven minutes.
00:35:23.040 - 00:35:24.510, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. There we go.
00:35:27.520 - 00:35:55.610, Speaker A: Someone once referred to this in a very interesting way, which is like they called it, instead of like an l one, it's l zero social consensus. So the merges and changes to chains like the merge only happen because the miners, the validators, sign up and agree to do it. Right. So I feel like that's such an interesting idea that there's still this societal, social consensus where if everyone involved in Ethereum didn't want to, it would never happen.
00:35:56.140 - 00:35:59.092, Speaker B: Yeah. In the end, it all comes down to social consensus.
00:35:59.156 - 00:36:15.260, Speaker A: Yeah, but the only risk here comes from that social consensus. Right. If everyone agrees that it happens perfectly, then it's going to happen perfectly. If people say, hey, no, I disagree with that consensus. I'm going to create my own. That's when things might go weird.
00:36:16.180 - 00:36:31.260, Speaker B: Yeah, it looks like we are 27 blocks away. If ETH forks, would there be a fork of chain link, too? Does someone want to answer that one?
00:36:32.370 - 00:37:12.090, Speaker A: Right now, Chainlink is publicly committed to supporting the proof of stake fork. But I think that social consensus applies to everyone at some level of, like, everyone's watching to see what happens. So where applications are, where developers live, I think that's one of the guiding principles, is like, we want to support developers and make them successful. And so at the end of the day, we want to be on all the chains that make developers successful. But at the same time, there's so much uncertainty, or there was so much uncertainty about the forks, whereas I think the proof of stake kind of main net chain, there's much less uncertainty.
00:37:14.030 - 00:37:58.802, Speaker B: Yeah, makes sense. I'm seeing if there's any other questions here. I saw one before about can a validator node get staked from other members who want to stake their ETH? So you need 32 ETH per validator, and once that's submitted, it's kind of locked up. You can't withdraw or anything yet. So what some people do is if they have 32 e, they stake themselves, or if they have more, they can stake multiple validators. Some people go in with friends and say, hey, if you know someone and you're comfortable sharing this with them? Hey, let's put in some ETH together and stake a node. Or some people use third party staking services such as rocket pool.
00:37:58.802 - 00:38:13.440, Speaker B: And what's the other one? Is it Lido where even if you have like $200 worth of ETH, you can still stake it using their infrastructure, their network, and they take a fee and you kind of still get some rewards based on that as well?
00:38:13.810 - 00:38:40.150, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of the successor. We used to have mining pools where no computer graphics card is powerful enough to do 700 terrahashes and solve every block. Right? So everybody contributes to increase the overall probability of solving a block, and then you share the rewards. The same thing will happen with proof of stake, right? Like people will come together, share a little bit of ETH, and then that will be pooled together to create validators that then everybody shares in the rewards.
00:38:40.650 - 00:38:48.280, Speaker F: Hey, Et nodes are saying that the piglet is now live. Can you see?
00:38:49.230 - 00:38:55.180, Speaker A: I would trust Harry's node, but we'll see. It's an example of something that could go wrong.
00:38:56.750 - 00:39:05.200, Speaker B: Ready for the merge? Latest difficulty 587498 and it's 5875 is what we're looking for.
00:39:06.770 - 00:39:14.020, Speaker A: Bordell's has crashed. It's getting DDoS by all the people watching the merge. We're four minutes away, I think.
00:39:14.870 - 00:39:19.970, Speaker B: Mind you, this is in Australia, so maybe it takes longer to reach Australia. Who knows?
00:39:25.190 - 00:39:44.838, Speaker A: Is there an easy way to set up a validator node at home or will there be? I don't think they're going to make it any easier. I think you're going to need to run all of the clients. I mean, although Patrick mentioned that one of the clients actually runs both the consensus layer and the beacon layer. The consensus layer and the execution layer.
00:39:45.014 - 00:40:16.100, Speaker B: Yeah. One thing I'll say though, is that whether you're using geth, nevermind, prism, lighthouse, whatever, clients, they all have pretty good docs to follow, and they all have a good community in discord where if you're running to issues and ask for help, you'll definitely get kind of help. So it seems a bit daunting at first, and there's testnets that you can play around on as well before you commit to doing it on main net, but there is good support for it, and once you've got it going and running, it's not as bad as you think.
00:40:16.950 - 00:40:29.186, Speaker C: And in terms of setup, Harry, just on that, I mean, obviously hardware is important because it takes quite a lot of storage. Has anyone here done a snapsync or has everyone just done full sync?
00:40:29.218 - 00:40:55.840, Speaker B: Those who've done it I think depends on which client you use. So currently the beacon chain is about a couple of hundred gigs or 100 gigs or something I think. And the ETH one depending on which client I'm using. Nevermind. And I think that's about a terabyte at the moment for like a full node, but it's not like a full archive node which is even more. But it depends on what client use. I think Geth is the chain is bigger than 1 moment.
00:40:56.210 - 00:40:56.866, Speaker C: Yeah it is.
00:40:56.888 - 00:41:10.610, Speaker A: And that's why the hardware thing, we are super close. Two minutes or less. Some people counting blocks. I don't think you can count blocks because it totally depends on the difficulty in those blocks which you can't predict. Right. Like probabilistic.
00:41:10.690 - 00:41:11.270, Speaker B: We got it.
00:41:11.340 - 00:41:11.960, Speaker A: Look.
00:41:12.490 - 00:41:13.560, Speaker B: What's this?
00:41:17.450 - 00:41:18.200, Speaker F: Wow.
00:41:19.470 - 00:41:20.220, Speaker B: Hey.
00:41:25.950 - 00:41:30.330, Speaker A: All right, what should everyone put in the chat about the merge? Just pandas.
00:41:31.330 - 00:41:33.120, Speaker B: Put something in the chat guys.
00:41:33.490 - 00:41:36.960, Speaker A: Merge pandas, yes.
00:41:38.610 - 00:41:41.680, Speaker E: So exciting. We just witnessed history together.
00:41:42.290 - 00:41:47.540, Speaker A: Yeah. Couldn't think of a better place to do it than with everyone here.
00:41:47.910 - 00:41:55.060, Speaker B: That's exactly right. Let's take a look at the beacon chain explorer and monitor over the next few minutes. Now.
00:41:56.890 - 00:41:58.680, Speaker A: What was the magic block number?
00:42:01.770 - 00:42:10.266, Speaker B: How am I going to find that now? Let's see. Well we should be able to check this chain as well.
00:42:10.368 - 00:42:16.860, Speaker F: The old one, etherescan is good now or no.
00:42:25.170 - 00:42:28.400, Speaker A: Harry, were you just on beaconscan.com or what were you?
00:42:29.250 - 00:42:55.320, Speaker B: I'll share the link again. It's beaconchat in. So I think this one was a little bit before. No, sorry. It will be in this epoch. It's a question of what slot it was.
00:42:55.850 - 00:42:59.430, Speaker A: I'm seeing a lot of proposed blocks, I'm not seeing a lot of confirmed blocks.
00:43:00.250 - 00:43:02.170, Speaker B: Where are you looking? Did you want to share your screen?
00:43:02.240 - 00:43:03.738, Speaker A: Most recent blocks on the right side?
00:43:03.824 - 00:43:05.420, Speaker C: Yeah. On the right side, yeah.
00:43:05.950 - 00:43:07.340, Speaker A: Is that a bad sign?
00:43:08.430 - 00:43:22.350, Speaker B: No, that's fine, because I think like I said earlier, it takes two thirds over a certain amount over two epochs to have them as like finalized, I think.
00:43:22.500 - 00:43:25.538, Speaker C: And on the beacon chain the epoch is 6.4 minutes, right?
00:43:25.624 - 00:43:28.740, Speaker B: On the beacon chain it's what? Sorry?
00:43:29.110 - 00:43:31.140, Speaker C: 6.4, is that right?
00:43:31.990 - 00:43:33.282, Speaker B: What? 6.4, sorry?
00:43:33.336 - 00:43:36.546, Speaker C: 6.4 minutes. That's the duration of an epoch isn't it?
00:43:36.568 - 00:43:37.454, Speaker B: On the beacon chain?
00:43:37.502 - 00:43:38.100, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:40.410 - 00:43:42.758, Speaker B: X number of slots, do we know.
00:43:42.764 - 00:43:57.180, Speaker A: If everything worked perfectly? I mean blocks are being produced and Etherscan can see them, Harry's node can see them. I see contracts coming through. So it looks like it worked successfully, but I think it'll take us a little time to fully know that.
00:43:57.710 - 00:44:24.674, Speaker B: Yeah. So so far things are okay. Like I said, we've got what's called the merge block, which was created on the beacon chain within one or two slots of the cutoff point. So at this point the two chains are merged, but there might be multiple forks. Right. So we want to see one chain ideally. So if things go perfectly we should continue to get blocks and at the end of the epoch, up to 6.4
00:44:24.674 - 00:45:06.880, Speaker B: minutes later we want to see the finalized epochs. Just basically keep updating. Right. But we won't include the merge block until we get to that. Twelve to 15 minutes later when it's basically done that two epochs, that's when we'll see the merge block having been finalized and at that point we can guarantee that the merge is done and we can break out the scotch and champagne. So in terms of how that translates to visuals, I think if we see this epoch get finalized and then the next one, then it should be all good to go.
00:45:08.770 - 00:45:34.940, Speaker A: Sure. I think we should get a group photo with all of us. So if you want to stop sharing your screen for just a microsecond here, I'm going to take a screenshot. All right, everybody in the chat wave, everybody on the team. I think I looked away. Hold on, let's try this again. Three, two, one.
00:45:34.940 - 00:45:48.574, Speaker A: Got it. Perfect. To commemorate the merge. I'll tweet that out in a moment. Yeah.
00:45:48.612 - 00:46:00.930, Speaker E: What's going on on Twitter? I can see here Patrick is celebrating. Maybe you should Harry screenshot your terminal and post it on Twitter. The beautiful panda.
00:46:01.430 - 00:46:03.970, Speaker B: To do what? Sorry, screenshot my terminal?
00:46:04.550 - 00:46:10.978, Speaker E: Yeah. So Patrick screenshot his terminal. His panda image in the terminal. Celebrating.
00:46:11.074 - 00:46:21.002, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe after the call when I can zoom out and do it a bit easier, I'll definitely scroll up in the logs and get the panda. But we saw it live happen, right? Remember we all saw.
00:46:21.056 - 00:46:25.180, Speaker C: Yeah, you did see it in your journal. Yeah.
00:46:30.030 - 00:46:32.858, Speaker B: Beacon chain website is being spammed at the moment.
00:46:33.024 - 00:46:33.980, Speaker A: Big time.
00:46:35.390 - 00:46:48.850, Speaker B: How long has been worked on e two? So they started looking at ETH. This wasn't proof of stake actually mentioned in the original white paper. So from the get go they always had the plan to kind of do this. That's my understanding.
00:46:55.610 - 00:46:57.430, Speaker A: Where's the drinks and the champagne?
00:46:59.930 - 00:47:02.038, Speaker E: We only have popcorn at the moment.
00:47:02.204 - 00:47:04.440, Speaker A: Should have popcorn though.
00:47:05.450 - 00:47:10.380, Speaker F: I have energized dream to be wake up until 04:00 a.m.
00:47:12.750 - 00:47:27.360, Speaker A: I have work in 6 hours like Max B is reminding me that this is on YouTube. So all the screenshots you want, 30 screenshots. A second.
00:47:31.970 - 00:47:34.190, Speaker B: Beta chain site is beyond.
00:47:35.670 - 00:47:55.960, Speaker A: And Ruben says it's like a spaceship taking off. It totally does feel like, like, did anyone else watch the SpaceX launches with a bunch of. I it was the magic moment when the drone was like. Or when the rocket landed the booster for the first time and everyone's like flipping out because it's just like such amazing video.
00:47:57.930 - 00:48:06.540, Speaker B: So the Beacon scan website, which is another explorer for the beacon chain, seems to be working, but I'm not as good as reading this one, though.
00:48:07.390 - 00:48:19.040, Speaker A: Interesting question, which is how much cheaper are gas fees now if you just look at ETH gas station, they do seem to have gone down a fair amount.
00:48:25.430 - 00:48:36.870, Speaker B: Yeah. My understanding is there might be slight marginal gains, but nothing huge until some of the future kind of plans of the Ethereum two rollout are kind of implemented.
00:48:43.130 - 00:49:02.320, Speaker E: Exactly. In my understanding, technically this is not going to solve the potential problem of a huge gas fees. What I can see here that the gas price declined is maybe just people are waiting for a couple of more blocks to be finalized, all of that stuff, before continue using Ethereum again.
00:49:06.610 - 00:49:07.360, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:09.410 - 00:49:36.550, Speaker A: The mental model I've always had around gas is that you're paying for the compute of the entire network. And so the compute requirements haven't actually changed that much. Like all of the validators have to run every transaction on the blockchain. And so you're still paying for a lot of compute. It's just organized differently. Instead of being secured by mining, it's being secured by the proof of stake and the consensus layer.
00:49:37.050 - 00:49:43.340, Speaker E: Exactly. My mental model is that you're paying for decentralization by paying for gas. But yeah.
00:49:48.510 - 00:49:57.520, Speaker B: So we're just waiting for this epoch to be finalized, which should be happening now at any time.
00:49:59.330 - 00:50:59.250, Speaker A: Actually, we've got a whole lot of people in the chat here. Does anyone have a main net application? Is it still working? How's it working for everyone that's watching right now? Is everyone furiously fixing their nodes in the background? Dan just asked where's all the electricity savings? Well, as soon as they turn off the GPUs that are doing a lot of the mining, that's where the electricity savings are. If all of those GPUs end up getting transitioned to another chain, then there won't be any electricity savings. But theoretically the economics should be that it is less profitable to do GPU mining and proof of work mining that burns all this electricity.
00:50:59.830 - 00:51:18.630, Speaker B: Yeah, someone asked how the keepers are doing the beacon chain website is down again. I can't check the epochs.
00:51:20.510 - 00:51:37.920, Speaker A: I just tried running my mining rig and it says can't parse JSon. So the miners are shutting down. And so if the mining pools are shutting down, if the Ethereum mining pools are shutting down, there's probably a lot of GPUs. They're going to start slowly spinning down.
00:51:39.490 - 00:51:42.750, Speaker B: Great news. If you're a gamer though, looking for a GPU.
00:51:46.870 - 00:51:58.680, Speaker A: What's the next big game that's going to need all those GPUs? Is it still Eldon ring? Is it cyberpunk? I want to try cyberpunk since like 1.6 came out, but Cyberpunk is cool.
00:51:59.690 - 00:52:01.240, Speaker B: Now that they fixed it.
00:52:02.090 - 00:52:06.680, Speaker A: It's always got a lot of hate and it's not the best game in the world, but there's fun in there.
00:52:09.870 - 00:52:40.980, Speaker B: So I'll just share my screen quickly. We have a epoch confirmed screen two. So we have this epoch now finalized, which is good. That's what we wanted to see. And I think once we have, so I think the merge transitionary period happened here, or was it just before they're in there, and then once we get to this one as well, then it's officially done and dusted 100%.
00:52:42.870 - 00:52:47.880, Speaker A: What is that voted percentage? Is that the number of nodes that checked in?
00:52:48.570 - 00:53:22.350, Speaker B: Yeah. All the other validators that aren't proposing blocks for the epoch still need to do attestations and vote and check everything for the proposers. So everyone gets rewarded every block a little bit of ETH. So even if you aren't involved in the block creation process just for doing that attestation and voting, your validator will receive a little bit of ETH. So it's a constant kind of income stream. But obviously if you get chosen out of the one out of 411,000 or however many it was validators to propose that next block, you obviously get a bigger award.
00:53:24.150 - 00:53:31.300, Speaker E: Can we now check the first graffiti message? Is this the moment we bet on some value?
00:53:32.230 - 00:53:38.440, Speaker A: Yeah, because we have the block number. The block number was ending in 7393.
00:53:40.410 - 00:53:42.280, Speaker B: We have the what? The block number?
00:53:42.890 - 00:53:43.640, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:44.970 - 00:53:47.862, Speaker B: Which block number was that though, where.
00:53:47.996 - 00:53:50.730, Speaker A: The difficulty threshold was passed?
00:53:51.470 - 00:53:53.498, Speaker B: Was it the beacon chain? Block number though?
00:53:53.584 - 00:53:56.074, Speaker A: I assume that's an execution chain number.
00:53:56.272 - 00:53:57.290, Speaker F: Execution.
00:53:57.870 - 00:54:01.142, Speaker B: Because the graffiti is on the beacon chain, it's not on the execution.
00:54:01.286 - 00:54:02.140, Speaker A: Got it.
00:54:04.350 - 00:54:41.194, Speaker B: Someone may have found the exact one, but it'll probably take a little bit of possibly a little bit of time to work out exactly which one on the e two chain was the one. I think you can actually tell I think because the block on e two doesn't have just the default transaction data in it. But unless one of you guys can find out, I'm not 100% sure which pit of data in the block contains that. And the website is crashing again.
00:54:41.392 - 00:54:46.460, Speaker C: Yeah, I've been looking for it myself, but I'm not able to load beaconchar in.
00:54:47.710 - 00:54:52.430, Speaker A: I mean, shouldn't the beacon chain block be encoded in every execution block?
00:54:54.850 - 00:54:56.000, Speaker B: Say that again.
00:54:57.650 - 00:55:04.180, Speaker A: Doesn't there need to be a reference to the beacon chain block in every execution chain block now?
00:55:06.470 - 00:55:10.500, Speaker B: Great question. I'm not 100% sure on that. Logically it makes sense.
00:55:13.270 - 00:55:22.760, Speaker A: Here we go. If you look in ether scan, you can see that the difficulty went from eleven whatever to zero.
00:55:24.970 - 00:55:26.440, Speaker B: Whereabouts is that? Sorry.
00:55:27.130 - 00:55:55.010, Speaker A: Just here. I'll paste link to ether scanning. So this looks like the first block with zero difficulty. So that's how you can tell that it's positive confirmation. This was a proof of stake mine block.
00:55:56.870 - 00:56:06.234, Speaker C: I think if you find a block mined by an address rather than a minor pool, it is the first block mined in the beacon chain.
00:56:06.382 - 00:56:24.540, Speaker A: Probabilistically, yes. But who knows every now and then. Oh, here we go. Bilal has said the first block after merge was beacon chain slot 470 00:15.
00:56:29.710 - 00:56:38.220, Speaker C: And we need to figure out which block within that slot would have been right. I mean, I know it's a one to one mapping, but.
00:56:42.830 - 00:57:28.220, Speaker A: It. It. Someone called this out in the chat too. But the block reward for the first proof of stake block was much higher. It was 45 e rather than like one or two or $0.7.
00:57:28.770 - 00:57:33.680, Speaker E: I saw the graffiti message and I'm kind of disappointed. This is like the default one.
00:57:43.910 - 00:58:24.080, Speaker A: There was a problem at the last company I worked at where every PR was just a sequential number. And so around all of the big numbers, like 100,000, a million, 10 million, everyone would start spamming PRs to try and get PR number. Like 10 million or 100 million or whatever. And it got so bad that people would write bots to try and send a PR to get the PR number. Like one of these magical, important PR numbers. So funny how we care so much about arbitrary numbers.
00:58:25.810 - 00:58:26.560, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:58:30.390 - 00:58:39.060, Speaker A: All right, well, anyone seeing anything going wrong on Twitter? Otherwise, maybe we all celebrate and kick off for the night.
00:58:48.970 - 00:58:50.280, Speaker F: Yes. All good.
00:58:52.410 - 00:59:00.700, Speaker A: It's kind of quiet. I was afraid of a storm of everyone freaking out about everything. But everything seems to be working pretty well.
00:59:01.630 - 00:59:07.310, Speaker E: Exactly like in my Twitter feed. Just Panda's screenshot of different terminals.
00:59:09.250 - 00:59:12.190, Speaker A: Probably more terminal screenshots than you'll normally see. On Twitter.
00:59:12.850 - 00:59:13.600, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:59:17.330 - 00:59:23.700, Speaker A: All right, well, should we call this ethereum merge block party a success after it was almost perfectly an hour?
00:59:25.270 - 00:59:26.020, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:59:27.910 - 00:59:38.440, Speaker A: All right, well, thank you all for watching. Hopefully everyone had fun. We learned something about the Ethereum merge. Thank you for being with us on this historic moment. Any other parting thoughts from the team?
00:59:41.130 - 00:59:43.000, Speaker F: No. We have.
00:59:44.730 - 00:59:53.340, Speaker C: Everybody in the western hemisphere in North America should get some, South America should get some sleep and the rest of us will stay in God duty and make sure everything goes okay.
00:59:53.710 - 00:59:58.140, Speaker A: Yeah, you're going to make sure everything goes great, right? You're just going to make sure everything.
00:59:58.750 - 01:00:00.790, Speaker C: I'm just going to monitor everything. Don't worry.
01:00:00.870 - 01:00:03.020, Speaker B: We'll monitor the blocks as I come in.
01:00:03.550 - 01:00:04.250, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:00:04.400 - 01:00:05.820, Speaker E: We're in good hands.
01:00:06.190 - 01:00:10.530, Speaker A: Thanks, Frank. Goodbye, everyone. Have a fantastic night.
01:00:10.680 - 01:00:11.342, Speaker F: Bye.
01:00:11.486 - 01:00:17.150, Speaker A: Welcome to the new epoch you be. Bye.
