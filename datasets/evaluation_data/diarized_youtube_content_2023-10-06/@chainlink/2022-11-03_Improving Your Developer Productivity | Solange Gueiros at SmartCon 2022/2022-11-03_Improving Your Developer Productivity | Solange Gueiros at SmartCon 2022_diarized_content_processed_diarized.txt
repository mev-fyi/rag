00:00:14.730 - 00:00:44.726, Speaker A: Hello. Hello everyone. First of all, I like to confess to you that if I am here coding life, I don't need to see nothing. I can close my eyes and code, but because this is a talk that I'm not coding, I will read my slides a bit. Okay, I need to confess this for you. So I'm here to tell you about how to improve your productive as a developer. My name is Soleil Jigerus.
00:00:44.726 - 00:01:49.600, Speaker A: The people call me Sol. I am from Chainlink Labs. I am a developer advocate and I'm traveling around the world to teach not only about Chainlink, but I'm so proud in bringing more developers to this world, teaching them how to create your first match content, for example. I really love this. And first of all, what is productivity? I'm talking about getting more work done. And we can do this with the same hysteresis or in a shorter period of time, or with less hysteresis and the same period of time. But how can productivity be measured? We have a lot of ideas and a lot of methods to do this, like lines of code, bugs, fixed code reviews, number of commits, finished tasks, deployments, releases, whatever.
00:01:49.600 - 00:02:21.318, Speaker A: We can have different measures for this, but sometimes lines of code don't come easy. You feel anxious, you are unable to concentrate. Yes, we are. Deployment is. Development is hard. It require a lot of concentration. We work with complex algorithms and deal with multiple tasks.
00:02:21.318 - 00:03:10.360, Speaker A: Staying productive is not easy. So here I am to give you some tips and tricks to improve your productivity. First, create an optimal environment. It means something like, first of all, the best developer workspace may look different for each of you, but minimize distractions and maximize the comfort. Think about the hardware. You must have, the best computer, the best laptop. If you are waiting, things happen.
00:03:10.360 - 00:04:04.628, Speaker A: No, you must be really fast and think about the mouse, the keyboard, the microphone, the headphones. Like I don't like nothing inside my ear, so I need the big headphones, a second screen. I told you that I travel around the world to teach, but I cannot live without a second screen. I bought a portable and this makes totally difference for me. And think about to have an ergonomic workspace like a table with ideal high a quality chair comfortable enough to sit for long periods. And I'd like to tell that hotels doesn't have this. Okay, yes, I put pillows in the chair and proper lighting.
00:04:04.628 - 00:05:45.272, Speaker A: I bought sockets and lamps to use in hotels. So this is hard when you are traveling, but you can do this in your home and limited distractions. Do you know that a software developer will need between ten or 15 minutes to recover from distractions and resume work. And this is hard for us so avoid getting interrupted, particularly in the middle of some difficult process and it will be hard to catch up the flow again. I will talk about the floor later and you can learn how to deal with the distractions like you need to decide what is a sanction and no essential for you like turn notifications off do you know you are trying to work and pop up messages from email is like discord, Whatsapp telegram how can't I really I can't. So you can read the message later when you take a break. Configure your phone turn off screen notification slides silent mode use the silent mode turn on the do not disturb feature before start your work session and I need to tell you that when I'm traveling I do this and sometimes my husband, my mom hey where are you? Are you live? Because I forgot to turn on again.
00:05:45.272 - 00:07:10.420, Speaker A: But we need to learn this and split the work day into intervals. A period for deep work and other time for easy tasks. I hope you have easy tasks as well. And what about sound? Do you prefer the silence or what kind of music do you like to work like? I prefer the silence but you can use noise canceling headphones if you are in a noise environment for example and take breaks and get some rest, especially when we are doing something long and we'd like to finish as soon as possible. But sometimes it's better to go out a bit, step away from your coat and walk across the off scene. Now we walk across our home a lot of times but give your brain a change to refresh and take breaks. This will boosts creativity, helps on focus, improves mental health, helps your process and retain information better and reduces stress.
00:07:10.420 - 00:07:44.690, Speaker A: And this is so so important. Be flexible and work smarter. You don't must be in a table from 09:00 a.m. To 06:00 p.m. Use your time in the best way you can and this is so important especially for me because I am brazilian. Sometimes my English is not the best and I can't understand and I can be understood. So this is so important.
00:07:44.690 - 00:08:45.410, Speaker A: Make sure that you understand the task clearly and define the tools and strategy you use. Design before implement, draft before start to develop and share the ideas with someone was to be sure that they understand what you are saying and keep your code blocks clean and short. Do you know dry? Don't repeat yourself like create codes that you can reuse and not be crazy when you need to change one line in ten different place. And what about keys? Keep it short and simple. It means that even when we are trying to code, try to be clearing what you are doing. Someone will read your code later. Think about this.
00:08:45.410 - 00:09:52.520, Speaker A: Automate everything like command lines, test, manipulation logs, refactoring, building, deploying, integrating everything if you need to. Don't do the same thing more than once. It's better for you. And do you know CI CD the continuous integration, deployment and automated testing because this will ensure that quality is built into your product and help deliver software faster and better. Automate to catch up any bugs early in the process and think about smart context. If you find a bug in the smart context after it's deployed by yes, we know this is a huge problem and reduce the time you spent on manual testing and document your code. This is hard I know especially, but the best way is do this like before or while coding.
00:09:52.520 - 00:10:42.632, Speaker A: Never at the end or after because you don't have time to do this after and learn and connect. I'm talking about like nevis, never stop learning from other people mistakes and success. Talk to other people. Share ideas about coding, problem solving, bugs fixing and especially how to improve your developer productivity. Cultivate good habits like drink more order I need to do this. I know. Focus on your mental health, sleep, health, diet, move your body, spend time with friends like I move my body.
00:10:42.632 - 00:11:17.670, Speaker A: I dance samba. I know how to dance samba and I can do this. Find someone for you as well. Find your flowy state and this is amazing. Really amazing. Because just as a muse comes to writers or artists, developers who can catch the wave and be fully involvement in the process. Also stop not seeing the path of time during code.
00:11:17.670 - 00:12:17.476, Speaker A: And what is this? In positive psychology, being the flow or in the zone means performing an activity while fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement and enjoyment. And it allows you to give out your focus to a specific problem that you are trying to solve. It's a booster for your performance, makes you productivity and how you can do this. You need to experiment with your work environment. Try to work when you are most productive, plan your big projects around that time can be in the morning, at night. Like I know that I work better at night. I hate to wake up early and this is a personal history.
00:12:17.476 - 00:13:00.630, Speaker A: Like I don't know that someday I will live near a six flags because now I don't live. But when it's possible I go to the park and I choose a whole coaster that I love and try to go as many times as possible without go to the line again. And then when I come back to the hotel I know that I do my best work. Like I don't need to stay all day in the park. I stay one week and go like 2 hours per day in the park every day and come back and work. This is amazing for me. I don't know you, but you need to find some like this for you makes the difference.
00:13:00.630 - 00:13:52.420, Speaker A: And last but not least, develop yourself first. Like you need to be a constant learner. Feed your brain different tasks, read books, different projects, experience, collaborate outside your team, connect with people around the world, around the conference and so important. Productive games don't happen overnight. So you are unique. You are NFT. Like we are a non fociable person or token whatever, but we are unique and each of us has a different way to do things and to learn and to be productive.
00:13:52.420 - 00:14:37.110, Speaker A: But think that there is no one size fits all approach to productivity. Each of you has a unique personality and working style, and what works for one developer couldn't be a total failure to another. And to conclude, this is a never ending story. Like being productive isn't a project that you complete, it's a continuous process. Productive games doesn't happen overnight. So this is me again. Feel free to connect me and thank you so much.
00:14:37.110 - 00:14:46.850, Speaker A: You close.
