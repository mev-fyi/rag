00:00:00.170 - 00:00:44.378, Speaker A: You. I remember the first time I downloaded music. It was like magic. And I thought, I'm never buying a CD ever again. And at the time, it wasn't that obvious, because if you remember were, the whole industry was organized around the idea that you had to physically print content on a device. It had to be a CD. Right? Fast forward.
00:00:44.378 - 00:01:20.760, Speaker A: Today, we are all streaming. We're all streaming. And YouTube and Netflix are bigger than TV. And that's because streaming is strictly superior to buying a CD. It's just better. So, as soon as it was technically possible, it was inevitable. Now we're all here, thanks to a new technology.
00:01:20.760 - 00:01:59.960, Speaker A: Clicker, clicker, clicker. No reason. Okay, it's working. All right. Whoo. New technology. All right.
00:01:59.960 - 00:02:45.190, Speaker A: So that new technology, obviously decentralization. Until recently, it was not possible to build decentralized applications. It's possible now. Now builders can create apps that cannot be shut down, that cannot cheat. It'll run as coded, that can move massive amounts of value. This was not possible before, but today, it is technically possible. So what they can do is they can build for their consumers apps that are verifiable.
00:02:45.190 - 00:03:36.410, Speaker A: What does that mean, verifiability? Well, for a consumer, it means to use a bank that they can verify where their funds are. This is new. They can buy insurance that they can verify how the payout works. This is new. They can use trading apps that they can verify will not block their trades at the worst moment for them. You know what I'm talking about? Consumers will demand this. They will demand verifiability, because for them, it's a way to keep apps, organizations, businesses accountable.
00:03:36.410 - 00:04:36.638, Speaker A: Verifiability will drive accountability. And this is inevitable because just like streaming, it is strictly superior. Why would you use an app if you're a consumer, that you cannot verify when you have the same app, same thing that you can verify. So the key here is that for this revolution to happen fully, you only have to make it easy to build. Consumers will drive this. But building verifiability is not easy, because web two and web3 are fundamentally disjointed. Now, the whole world is still on web two, and you can't ask them to throw away everything, all their investments, and start from scratch.
00:04:36.638 - 00:05:21.470, Speaker A: This is not going to work. This is why the transition will be progressive. Hybrid applications are the answer, where verifiability gets integrated into existing stacks and existing business models. By the way, this is how mobile, the cloud and now AI got mass market by getting integrated into the existing systems and institutions. Get this, they understand this very well. Finance, insurance, gaming, logistics. The whole finance sector is moving towards tokenization.
00:05:21.470 - 00:06:09.730, Speaker A: Because assets are more valuable on chain, they're easier to transact. So financial institutions are making this huge leap forward, jumping many technological steps to connect their legacy system on chain and becoming, in the process, more efficient, reducing costs and accessing massive liquidity. And we could see on LinkedIn the titles change. We could see that. VP of tokenization, head of digital asset strategy, chief Defi officer these are very clear signs that the shift is happening to enable hybrid applications. We need to solve these problems. First, connectivity.
00:06:09.730 - 00:06:47.950, Speaker A: Chains are not connected with each other. Chains are not connected to web two. Then security. Last year, there have been over $2.5 billion of hacks and then standards. We need to create standards that everybody uses, just like TCP IP for web two, what is needed is the standard connectivity layer to connect chains with each other and with web two in a super secure way. And this is how the industry massively takes off, where everything's finally connected.
00:06:47.950 - 00:07:33.100, Speaker A: And will builders, they don't have to start from scratch. They don't have to throw away what they've already built. And that is why we're building Chainlink. Chainlink's goal is to be that standard, a platform that all developers use to build verifiable apps. Now, last year in New York was the first time that we laid out that vision for our platform with three pillars, data, compute and cross chain. And since then, we've been heads down executing against this vision. We've listened to hundreds of developers and we've shared our plans with you, our community.
00:07:33.100 - 00:08:00.580, Speaker A: And so today, I have a few exciting things to share with you. Let's get started. Let's start with data. Data feeds were the original use case of connecting a smart contract with pricing data. And this has given birth to the whole field of DFI. And thanks. For our users, Chainlink is now the absolute industry standard in bringing data on chain security.
00:08:00.580 - 00:08:28.720, Speaker A: We're trusted by the biggest protocols in web3. Ave synthetics, GMX compound. We've enabled over $8 trillion of transaction. We've delivered more than 10 billion data points on chain. This is such a massive achievement. And I would like to thank all our community, all of you, for helping us build this standard. Thank you.
00:08:28.720 - 00:09:31.720, Speaker A: We've integrated data with 16 chains and counting, and we're increasingly delivering to L two s and app chains and investing in zk roll ups. But there's still so much to do in data, starting with derivatives. The potential for derivatives on chain is massive and DFI is constantly innovating creating, putting on chain new instruments like options, perpetual futures and other products. But only 2% of that volume is on Dexes. Why is that? This is because derivatives need lower latency, which is something that's hard to do with data feeds. Push model. So we needed a new model to deliver data on chain.
00:09:31.720 - 00:10:27.800, Speaker A: We've worked with the best in the industry to understand how to solve for this use case. And a really important aspect is to deliver an amazing user experience without sacrificing on data quality, reliability and security. And after a lot of hard work, we're now announcing data streams, our new low latency data solution, and you can apply here for early access. The data stream is a new model, super scalable, super cost efficient. Data feeds is a push model, writing data always on chain. Datastream is a pool model, where you ask for data only when you need it. This is going to be a huge deal, not only for derivatives, but for the whole field of defi.
00:10:27.800 - 00:11:19.050, Speaker A: We're talking subsecond tradings, experiences, front running protection with a commit and reveal architecture, a decentralized and credibly neutral infrastructure. And as always, conflict of interest free data streams gives you more than a single price point. This is something that many of you have asked for. So we're adding other signals like liquidity and volatility signals, bida spread. You could also ask for multiple data points within a single transaction, which saves gas and improves user experience. And we've built this product with our users. Back in April, we've announced a historic deal with the GMX community, and since then we've been hard at work to launch it.
00:11:19.050 - 00:12:03.524, Speaker A: So when Mainnet. Well, I'm pleased to announce that we're now live with GMX on Arbitrum. I can tell you this has been a lot of hard work, a lot of sleepless nights. I think a lot of, I can see a lot of people here being very happy about this. And the DMX team has been really fantastic. I really want to thank them on behalf of the team for an amazing collaboration. And it's not that often that you get to invent the future of a whole field, hand in hand with a leader in the industry.
00:12:03.524 - 00:12:37.590, Speaker A: And this is why we do what we do, this is why we are all here, to invent the future. So we're live, and we're already working with ten, over ten projects to integrate data streams. And if you're interested, we want to talk to you. Okay, next, let's look at crosschain. As we all know, we live in an increasingly multichain world, public chains, private chains. But there's a big problems. Those chains don't talk with each other.
00:12:37.590 - 00:13:06.312, Speaker A: And this create huge problems. First, liquidity is fragmented. So trading across chains is painful. Using collaterals, painful governance spainful. And this goes way beyond DFI. There are almost $900 trillion worth of assets waiting to be tokenized. But the cross chain problem is a huge blocker.
00:13:06.312 - 00:13:53.660, Speaker A: Because if you're an asset manager, why would you put your asset on chain for it to see it trapped only on one chain versus move freely across all chains? I think about it, if we could just unlock a few percent of these trillion dollars, what this would mean for the whole industry. And more generally, we're missing interoperability, and that is killing innovation. As a developer, you need to be able to mix and match the best of chain A with the best of chain B. This is how innovation works. So, okay, this is a huge problem for the whole space. How do we solve this? Well, first, technically it's super hard. And security is the most important consideration of all.
00:13:53.660 - 00:14:26.260, Speaker A: Half of the funds stolen in Defi are from bridge hacks. But it's more than just a technical problem. It's more than just creating a product. We need a standard. We need a common language that everybody uses. And the more people use it, the more valuable it becomes for everyone. So how do you build a standard? Well, you need security, needs flexibility, and you need a community of builders.
00:14:26.260 - 00:14:56.210, Speaker A: And Chainlink has all three. So for those of you who were there, we launched CCIP in July with synthetics and Ave at ECC Paris. It was really a historical moment. The energy was just unbelievable. And there was this feeling that this was a milestone for the whole industry. So we launched on mainet early access. And since then, the demand has been amazing.
00:14:56.210 - 00:15:47.760, Speaker A: We built CCIP with five levels of security, following a defense in depth strategy. Security and reliability will always remain our top priority, so you can focus on your use case. It's incredibly flexible, and all our users have been telling us how easy it is to integrate. And because Chainlink is a platform, well, if you're already using data feeds, using CCIP is an easy decision because it doesn't introduce any new trust assumptions. So we launched in July. What happened since then? Like I said, demand has just been crazy. So we have now over 80 projects integrating CCIP across seven different chains.
00:15:47.760 - 00:16:35.676, Speaker A: And that just in less than three months. And it's just so cool to see how much people have been waiting for something like this. And that's the beauty of a platform. You take something that's inherently difficult, like cross chain bridging. You make it sound super easy, and then you see users just run with it and do amazing things with it. We can also see the appetite from the banking world for CCIP. We're now testing CCIP with Swift and the largest institutions in the world, and the momentum is palpable.
00:16:35.676 - 00:16:50.480, Speaker A: CCIP is really the piece of infrastructure that they've been waiting for. One collaboration we're very excited about is with ANZ bank. And to tell us more about it, I would like to welcome on stage Anurag.
00:17:13.040 - 00:17:55.956, Speaker B: I'm here to talk about the biggest and the most exciting milestone of ANZ still steel assets journey. And to sum it up, I'm talking about cross chain, cross currency asset settlement. A mouthful. But at the end of this session, hopefully that will make sense. To get to that point, it's important to understand where the journey started and where we are now as a bank. We started our journey by creating a stable coin called a dollar DC. Once you have created a stable coin, it enables the customers to start transacting.
00:17:55.956 - 00:18:34.550, Speaker B: In the world of web3, the next logical step for us. Good. We have a stable coin so people can go use and buy those other assets in the tokenized form. Hence we created a tokenization engine as well as a marketplace where customers, once the asset is tokenized, can be listed for sale. The first cab off of the rank for us was carbon credits. So in March this year, we have tokenized carbon credits and our customers were able to use australian dollar stablecoin and purchase these assets. All sounds good till now.
00:18:34.550 - 00:19:34.052, Speaker B: That's where more challenging stuff start coming in, because every customer may not hold australian dollars stablecoin. What if the customer holds New Zealand dollars stablecoin? What if that New Zealand dollar stablecoin is on another network and not on the same network where the tokenized asset is? So all the stuff which we have done till date doesn't make sense then, because these things can't interoperate. That's where this clicker will work. That's where the challenges maybe to change. Cool, it worked. That's where the CCIP comes into picture. So what CCIP enables here is it enables seamless information and value flow.
00:19:34.052 - 00:20:23.560, Speaker B: What I mean by that, let's look at this picture and we'll try to go into a bit of depth. So the box on the left is symbolizing the chain on which the buyer of the tokenized asset is. And on this box you can see the buyer has New Zealand dollar stablecoin, whereas on the other chain which is the seller's blockchain. That's where the reef credit which is a tokenized asset, which buyer wants to purchase, but the seller want to receive australian dollars. So we have a mismatch here. That buyer has New Zealand dollar where seller want to sell this asset and get Aussie dollars. So remember the two words I said cross network or cross chain, cross currency asset settlement.
00:20:23.560 - 00:21:04.390, Speaker B: So if you look here, what is the information which has to flow between the two networks to enable this transaction. First piece of information is to which network I am going and buying the asset. What is the chain ID? Second information which has to be communicated is what is the contract address of that particular marketplace contract. So I can point to that contract and call the function. Without that you can't execute that information. The third thing is details related to that specific order. I want to purchase hundreds of the reef credit and I want to pay x dollars per reef credit.
00:21:04.390 - 00:21:53.376, Speaker B: That's all the information which has to flow from network number one to network number two to enable this transaction. And that's where CCIP comes into picture. And when the buyer hits the purchase button, all that information get encoded, sent to the router which is deployed on the chain number one. And the router is smart, it's not dumb router, it's a CCIP router. Obviously it's smart. It waits for the finality on the network number one, because until finality is not achieved we may have some risks of double spending and things like that. And only when the finality is received, then it relays the information to the other network that use this information and value to purchase the asset.
00:21:53.376 - 00:22:49.024, Speaker B: So if you look across this diagram, what's happening? New Zealand dollars are coming out from the customer account on the fly using FX API get converted into australian dollars. CCIP is used to encode all that information send via decentralized Oracle network to the router. On the other side, information get decoded, purchase happens and when the purchase have happened you are able to deliver the back asset again by using CCIP. This is what true asset interoperability look like where user doesn't have to worry about that. I need to be present on 100 networks to purchase these assets. I need to have all the stable coins in the world to purchase these assets. That's what the true asset interoperability look like when you use CCIP.
00:22:49.024 - 00:23:05.812, Speaker B: Big thanks to Chainlink team. They have been an amazing partner in our ability to execute a live transaction on Testnet. All the details are available in the white paper. So if you're interested, go have a look. Anz at CCIB case study all the details, transaction hashes you can look at. All big thanks. You have been amazing audience.
00:23:05.812 - 00:23:06.650, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:23:24.500 - 00:24:08.050, Speaker A: Thank you. We're very grateful for this collaboration. CCIP has really unlimited potential. These are just some of the examples of what you can do with it. It's really this key to toll interoperability and the vision is to enable an Internet of contracts, very much like what tcpip does for web two. So you're probably asking, when can I use it? Well, it's already available for everyone to use on Testnet and we're actively working towards GA on main net. Trust me, the teams are working day and night to get this to you.
00:24:08.050 - 00:24:57.040, Speaker A: But we also want to keep our security first approach. We're not cutting any corners and progressive deployment is the right way to go, but we see the incredible momentum and we really want to accelerate it and we want you to come build this standard with us. So if you're interested in integrating CCIP, we want to talk to you. Okay, now let's talk about compute. Starting with automation. Smart contracts need automation just because they don't come with it out of the box. And the most important thing with automation is reliability.
00:24:57.040 - 00:25:47.650, Speaker A: The last thing you want is to be wondering whether your automation job worked or silently failed. That's not good. Since launch, Chainlink Automation has become the leader in reliable web3 automation. And we got a lot of feedback from our users on what they want to see next. And one feedback we kept getting was, can we use Chainlink automation to move expensive computation off chain? Could we do that? Like on chain computation is expensive and hard to predict. So anything you can do to solve this is a very big deal. Well, I have great news to solve this, we're launching Chainlink Automation 20.
00:25:47.650 - 00:26:32.516, Speaker A: With 20, you can take your existing solidity code, move it to Chainlink automation, have it run in a decentralized, verifiable way, and save up to 90% gas. 90%. Boom. You've asked for it and we've delivered. By the way. You can either save the gas or you can do ten X more for the same budget. And it's not every day that you can ten X the computational capacity.
00:26:32.516 - 00:26:57.270, Speaker A: For developers, that is quite something. But there's more. We now have log triggers, so you can very easily compose contracts with each other through events. This was also a big ask. Any developers will tell you if you can build these loosely coupled contract. It's really a game changer. And with log triggers, you can now do it.
00:26:57.270 - 00:27:35.840, Speaker A: And finally, data streams are natively integrated so you can write your own logic in automation and access low latency data right inside automation. Another really important game changer. And that's, again, one of the great things about a platform using automation. Using data streams work better together. And to tell us more about automation, I'd like to welcome on stage Getty Hill.
00:27:48.940 - 00:28:21.344, Speaker C: Hi everyone. My name is Getty Hill. I am the CEO and co founder of GFX Labs. I've had the pleasure of getting to know the Chainlink team over the last three or so years. And today I'm going to show you guys how we're actually using Chainlink Automation to really redefine how on chain trading works and greatly improve it. So I want to introduce you guys to Oku, the most advanced trading interface on chain, built on top of uniswap v three. And a lot of you might be looking at this right now and be like, gosh, that really does not look like what uniswap V three is.
00:28:21.344 - 00:29:04.056, Speaker C: If you go to the Uniswap website, I think we're all used to the super simplistic interface they have. It's extremely elegant. It is fantastic. It has been adopted by hundreds of protocols at this point and replicated all over the place. But the reality is that while Uniswap is very dominant in the deck space, we found that binance and the leading centralized exchanges still represent the vast majority of on chain trading volume. And so the question that we were kind of tasked with by the Uniswap foundation was, how do we get folks to migrate over onto these trustless on chain solutions? And what are the things that are holding people back? So we got a lot of comment feedback that was like, hey, I want to have an order book. I'm accustomed to order books.
00:29:04.056 - 00:29:11.520, Speaker C: We're like, fantastic. Unispot V three has concentrated liquidity. We can create a synthetic order book. And that's exactly what you see up there.
00:29:11.670 - 00:29:12.092, Speaker A: Folks.
00:29:12.156 - 00:29:33.120, Speaker C: Said, I want trading view charts. I want to have all my charting that I'm used to on every single exchange, whether I'm at Kraken or finance or Coinbase giving my charting absolutely done. Every single Uniswap pool. I want live trading information. Sure. This trading information is awesome. The moment new trades come in and we're on every single major L, two and blockchain, it updates instantly.
00:29:33.120 - 00:30:06.892, Speaker C: And better yet, something that none of the centralized exchanges can do is you can go there and click on that trade as it comes in and be like, hey, who actually placed that trade. And then from there, of course, you have to have all your order history. Something that we take for granted when you're trading on a traditional exchange is hey, what have I actually traded in the past? Dexes aren't particularly great at giving you that information. And of course you have market orders, which are the bread and butter of things. That being said, there's a very key feature today that most Dexs are leaving out, and that is limit orders. Folks like to use limit orders. That is the bread and butter of trading.
00:30:06.892 - 00:30:44.200, Speaker C: And the reality is, while some defi protocols have tried to create limit orders, no one's really done a great job yet. We've had a few of different aggregators do it, but none of them have really solved it. And what you see up here is what it looks like to place a limit order on Oku. Now, everything you saw on the prior slide is uniswap v three. Everything you see in the whole presentation is uniswap v three on the other side, with the exception of the limit order contract. And what you do here is it's simple. Select what you want to buy or sell, put in the quantity, click your place to order, and you have your whole manner order flow on the other side there where you can see what you've opened the past, your open orders, cancel orders, et cetera.
00:30:44.200 - 00:31:29.900, Speaker C: Straightforward. But how we're actually using automation is what makes this novel compared to the other things you can do in DFI right now. What we're using is we're leveraging chainlink automation with Uniswap V three's concentrated liquidity platform. And we're saying hey, rather than maybe making a general narrow range liquidity position on an ETH USDC market from one thousand dollars to three thousand dollars, what if I wanted to place a bid at $1,000 and I want to place $1,000 bid with 1000 USDC so I get one ETH if I get filled. And this is an actual uniswap v three position. And what the chain lake automation system does here is it wraps this up into a nice package. That way the user, when they place this kind of synthetic limit order, in a sense it becomes a very real limit order.
00:31:29.900 - 00:32:13.352, Speaker C: You can place this order, walk away from a computer and know that when the market comes down to 1000, if it ever does that, the only way the market can get to through the 1000 price is by filling your order. And then the moment it does that, chainlink automation is going to go in there and it's going to remove your liquidity, and it's actually really simple. What you have up here on the two sides is the off chain component and the on chain component. We implement two key functions, the check upkeep and the perform upkeep. The check upkeep is the chainlink automation system running through, trying to figure out what's going on all the time and saying, hey, if there's something for me to do here, great, let's call the perform upkeep function on the contract. I'm actually going to remove that liquidity from pool to make sure you get your fill. So how do we plan on using automation 2.0?
00:32:13.352 - 00:32:32.704, Speaker C: Everything you've seen thus far has been 1.0 has been in the works for a long time now. 2.0 opens up a whole new realm of what we can do now. We've had tons of folks come to us and say, yeti, I want to have DCAs on chain. I want to be able to place a $10,000 buy over the course of a month, and I want it to fill me ten times. And I don't want to have to worry about it, just want it to work.
00:32:32.704 - 00:33:11.964, Speaker C: Great use case for automation. I have had folks come to us and say, I want stop orders, stop limit orders. That's an important part by how I trade on chain. Absolutely. That's something you can totally do with automation and is really just building upon the limit order functionality where we already have that's entirely unchained, entirely trustless. We have folks come to us and say automated liquidity provisioning is the future. That's very much what LP trading looks like on uniswap B three in these concentrated markets? How can automation help me manage running like a 5% spread on a market such that I always know where I'm quoting, and I always can be quoting on volatile markets in something that will be like in range in use so I can get the best fees and performance on.
00:33:11.964 - 00:33:49.720, Speaker C: And then what we're particularly excited about is an automations log. Triggers. Triggers opens up a whole new realm where we can say, hey, we might not always know what the best trigger is that you want for your trades, whether it's a stop limit order or otherwise. But we can build you a system to say, okay, you can have an external contract over here. When that event or function fires, then we can make sure that a trade happens over here on Uniswap, and we can build that simple interface. That way folks can build their own trading algorithms on chain without really having to be developers themselves. So this can give you a quick taste of what we really see, how Chainlink automation 2.0
00:33:49.720 - 00:34:05.200, Speaker C: is going to help us immensely to bring folks off the centralized exchanges, off the fears of FTX onto the decentralized future where most trading will eventually occur. So I have a longer talk tomorrow if anyone wants to come by. But yeah, thank you very much. We're very excited about automation.
00:34:26.260 - 00:35:17.700, Speaker A: Thank you, Getty. Okay, and now our last product update. Functions so smart contracts can't talk to web two APIs, but every time you connect a smart contract to a new source of data, a whole industry just pops up. And there's all these data out there and all these new services like chat, GPT, and developers just can't connect their smart contracts to these new services. This is something that every hackathon participant would ask us for all the time. And this is why we built functions. We built it to let developers focus on their own logic.
00:35:17.700 - 00:36:23.736, Speaker A: The idea is, don't waste your time on infrastructure. You write your own code, send it over, it runs serverless, decentralized. Chainlink does the infrastructure for you. And it was just phenomenal to launch functions testnet at Denver in March, watch our very own Steve announce on stage something that he very much cares about, and then see the reaction of developers, their imagination just running wild on all the things they could do with it. So launch was really great. But then you told us, hey, this is nice, it's not on main net when Mainnet, well, functions beta is now live on Mainnet. We are live on Ethereum, Polygon and avalanche.
00:36:23.736 - 00:37:07.050, Speaker A: And we spent all this time listening to your feedback and we made a lot of improvements. First, an NPM package, which is going to make life a lot easier. I know, I really wanted that one. A playground. It's really awesome. We literally invented a new way to manage API secrets with threshold encryption, and then tons of ways for you to control how you want to run your functions. Now, this is such a huge moment for web3, because now you have the power to try and test any idea that you can come up with.
00:37:07.050 - 00:37:57.576, Speaker A: And you know, that is really the best part of my job, watching all of you create all these new things and to surprise us. And that's why I love working on platform. It's because I get to see the future being invented by the community. And what I mean by community, well, it's this group of builders who are driving this revolution through the ups and downs, because they see how inevitable and positive this is. This is the most important part of what we're building the product is just the enabler. The real thing is the community. And our community is stronger than ever.
00:37:57.576 - 00:38:57.528, Speaker A: Every hackathon outgrows the other. The last one has had 500 submissions and I want to thank all the amazing work of our developer relations team and developer experts for their constant energy and dedication to the community with meetups and master classes and tutorials. The hacker house we just had before with 400 participants, it's pretty amazing and it's just incredible to see many of you here are the OGs and we're bringing in people every day and this is how revolutions work. You have the original believers and then it spreads like wildfire. We're creating an ecosystem of success. We're building it with startups, with blockchains. Our build program has now 50 members and the quality of the project is just unreal.
00:38:57.528 - 00:39:30.250, Speaker A: Like every time I go to build dinner or build event, I'm just blown away. This is another sign of the quality of the community. And the chainlink community has incredible momentum. We could see this time and time again. We connect Chainlink to a new chain and boom, the ecosystem lights up. And I want to thank our scale partners for working with us in bringing Chainlink to their ecosystem. And it's a great win win.
00:39:30.250 - 00:40:11.030, Speaker A: And more chains bring more developers, which then attracts more chains and the community keeps growing. So, beyond a great product, what do developers need? If you're a developer, you know how important docs are. Great docs make great developer platforms. That's why we work so hard on docs. That's why we are so proud of the high standard that we're putting out there. But we could do better. And you've told us that there's a lot of valuable information, but it's not always easy to find what you're looking for.
00:40:11.030 - 00:41:03.440, Speaker A: And we've heard you. And this is why we're launching the developer hub. What it does is it takes all these awesome content and puts it in a nice, simple, clean UI. It works for beginners, makes it super easy for you to get started, works for experts because it lets you find exactly that thing that you were looking for. I highly encourage you to go check it out. This UI is just so slick and it really makes me want to spend hours just consuming chain content. Then we're adding demos and code samples.
00:41:03.440 - 00:41:25.420, Speaker A: I love those. I don't know about you, but this is such an easy way to test something. Just pick up a demo, tweak it, see how it runs. You could see the architecture, the code, and try the application. They're live. For example, we've had a rugby demo. You can make your own prediction on a Rugby World cup, of course.
00:41:25.420 - 00:41:59.732, Speaker A: I'm predicting a french victory against the all Blacks in Paris. That's just my small wish. We'll see if it happens. After demos, we have quick starts. Quick starts are about getting you as fast to market as possible. So we're giving you these 20 super high quality templates so you don't have to waste your time reinventing the wheel, understanding how to plug the technology. These are really gold nuggets of productivity.
00:41:59.732 - 00:42:23.490, Speaker A: I highly encourage you to check them out. And one more cool thing, AI is changing everything. If you're coding without AI, you're totally missing out. So we've added an AI assistant train on our docs. You can ask it any question, and it'll help you build your next team. Like, for those of you who know me, I had to have AI. Come on.
00:42:23.490 - 00:43:31.030, Speaker A: Okay, so we've seen a lot. We've been busy. This is a recap of all the amazing progress of the chaining platform this past year. And there are many other products we didn't even get to talk about today, like proof of reserve, VRF, Deco, FSS, and you could learn more about them in all these great sessions. Now, I've said it before, at the end of the day, what matters is execution. And we've been heads down executing on our vision, the chaining platform, all these products working together, defining the industry standard. And I want to take a moment to thank all the hardworking people at Chinink Labs, to thank our amazing partners, and to thank our community, who's always behind us.
00:43:31.030 - 00:44:06.160, Speaker A: Thank you. We're witnessing a once in a lifetime revolution. It's happening all around us. As soon as it's technically possible, it is inevitable. Every business will have a web3 strategy. Consumers will demand verifiability because it's just superior. It's actually crazy how obvious this is.
00:44:06.160 - 00:44:52.216, Speaker A: I mean, we're all in this room. We can see it, which is a great place to be when you could see a revolution happening, and it's still not quite obvious to everyone else. It's a good place to be. So get started. And the best way to get started is to look at a market, look at your business, and ask yourself, where can you generate the most value by adding verifiability? Start there. Why should you even have it? Why will your consumers demand it? Start there, and then integrate it into your existing architecture using Chainlink. But you don't need to rebuild everything from scratch.
00:44:52.216 - 00:46:15.432, Speaker A: That's key and if you take a step back this is actually how innovation works. Anytime you introduce a new systemic change, something that's radically better, it's radically better but it's not compatible. So goes up and then slows down then people start working to integrate it make it more compatible it goes a little bit up and then slows down but when it becomes fully compatible shoots right up and we saw it with mobile, saw it with the cloud we're seeing now with AI, this is how those things become mass market by integrating into existing system this is how innovation works. So okay it's happening but where is it really going? I think this leads us to world of accountability. Verifiability drives accountability. With verifiability we can hold the people in power accountable because we can verify the promises that they made us. It's a massive transfer of power to the people, to us like, I like that, I want to build that so let's build it together.
00:46:15.432 - 00:46:21.190, Speaker A: Thank you. Close.
