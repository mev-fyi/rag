00:00:04.890 - 00:00:25.670, Speaker A: Hello. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining today's panel. My name is William Herklerath. I'm a managing director at Chainlink Labs, focusing on strategic initiatives, business development, and some of the other aspects of our business. And today I'm really pleased to be joined by Rick McFarland of LexisNexis. Rick, would you like to introduce?
00:00:26.250 - 00:00:53.870, Speaker B: Sure. Thanks. Thanks, William. Rick McFarland, chief data officer, LexisNexis. We're a legal data and analytics provider, and I am, formerly I worked at Hearst as our chief data scientist, and then before that I was@Amazon.com super excited to be here. Appreciate it.
00:00:54.020 - 00:01:10.530, Speaker A: Great. No, we're happy to have you. So, as far as we know, LexisNexis is interested in becoming a chainlink node provider, and we'd love to understand what some of the unique opportunities might be for trusted legal data in this smart contract economy.
00:01:11.830 - 00:02:17.270, Speaker B: Yeah, LexisNexis, for those people that don't know, we have a huge over two petabytes of current and historical legal case law data for the US and several other countries all around the world. We collect this data from over 50,000 different providers, and we actually store that. We mine it, we process it and create enrichments for it. We also collect a lot of news data as well as financial information. And basically we serve the legal market. I think smart contracts, they can start to begin to ask a number of legal proceeding questions involving a particular entity, like a company or an organization, and we can provide a lot of information regarding that legal entity.
00:02:17.850 - 00:02:30.720, Speaker A: That's fantastic. So I guess if you, let's say you're a smart contract developer and you're thinking about how to make the best use of some of this data, what are some of the first thoughts that come to your mind?
00:02:32.530 - 00:03:17.980, Speaker B: Well, we do keep track of lots of different regulatory filings about different companies, public companies. We also collect information and calculate ESG indexes, environmental, social governance indexes, that where we actually can look at companies being involved in different kinds of, for example, discrimination cases. Let's see. I feel like any number of these decentralized applications can begin to leverage some of that information in their contract development process.
00:03:19.310 - 00:03:42.820, Speaker A: That's good. So I know the brand, the brand has been around for a long time, and I'm certainly aware of it. And the premium data sets mean, are you thinking that just about everything in the Nexus library eventually has some position on chain, or are there specific data sets that you think are going to be the most relevant in the near?
00:03:43.990 - 00:05:01.660, Speaker B: I mean, I think my vision is eventually I'd like to see all of our data assets and information be leveraged in smart contracts because I believe many companies and many businesses are going to start entering into the smart contract environment and creating contracts on any number of topics and things and need decision making information. I think maybe in the near term more information around companies because I think a lot of smart contracts are done between organizations. Company information. We mine and collect data from the news data and legal news data as well, and we provide that information into M A deals. We help law firms understand and follow different companies reputations as they get involved over time in the news. So I think in the near term, I believe a lot of our company level information could be leveraged in a smart contract decision making.
00:05:02.270 - 00:05:12.000, Speaker A: That's great. And I think you have financial data as well, right? I'm guessing about you and or some of your sister companies have a fair amount of information in that area.
00:05:12.390 - 00:05:59.242, Speaker B: Yeah. We do maintain a very large data asset around companies. We collect information from many different sources, and some of that information includes, obviously we include the financial information, any kind of SEC filings. We maintain, we also maintain information around the leadership of that company, the sectors they're in. Obviously, we serve a lot of lawyers dealing with M A. So we do keep track of any kind of adjustments if the company joins with another, merges with another company or if the leadership changes. I think that information, because we deal with lawyers, we got to be up to date in a timely fashion.
00:05:59.242 - 00:06:05.710, Speaker B: So I think that would be something very useful in the near term for smart contracts.
00:06:05.870 - 00:06:34.300, Speaker A: Yeah. So is there a play possibly here where smart contracts and verifiable data within them can be used to create a more transparent and fair legal system? Obviously, it sounds like your clients are kind of already legal clients. Right. So if you think of a smart contract as effectively just another legal client, is there something particular about the way smart contracts work that can really add that transparency and that fairness into the process?
00:06:35.070 - 00:07:13.874, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think we've been thinking about this a lot lately. One of our important things we like to promote is what we call the rule of law around the world. And we actually calculate, we have a calculation, a metric around the rule of law, where we do it by country and by state. And it involves four key components. The equality of the law is one of them, accessibility to the law, transparency of the law, and access to an independent judiciary. These are four key components of our rule of law metric.
00:07:13.874 - 00:08:25.950, Speaker B: And we use our data that we collect internally from all the legal systems that we collect information from. And we calculate these scores over time. And I actually think that accessibility and transparency are two things that in certain countries or certain places of the world where the rule of law score is low and it's low because of lack of accessibility to the law or a lack of transparency, the laws can be quite complicated or not easy to understand by everybody, where smart contracts, with their decentralized networks and access to a shared upon, agreed upon oracle that's a well known and respected oracle, can create a level of transparency and bring the rule of law score up higher in areas where perhaps it's harder to have a fair contract.
00:08:26.930 - 00:08:38.402, Speaker A: That's great. So I think right away that leads me to think that this is an opportunity that's, I think, far beyond the US. Right? So, I mean, you guys are a US based firm, right? And I'm sure you have.
00:08:38.456 - 00:09:08.554, Speaker B: Oh, we're worldwide. Our headquarters in the US is in New York, but we're part of relics Group, a larger entity out of actually have. I'm the legal space, but the relics has medical as well as scientific data assets. But yeah, the US is a large part of our market force. We have worldwide reach.
00:09:08.752 - 00:09:34.420, Speaker A: And so with worldwide reach, worldwide data, different data sets, this is something. Is there an opportunity here? I guess maybe in parts of the world where this data is that really part of the play here? Is taking advantage of getting this data distributed to places where it might be more difficult to obtain? And if so, do you have some examples maybe of how you think that might play out?
00:09:36.250 - 00:11:00.320, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, not everybody can afford to have access to LexisNexis in some of the countries where. And also you have to have some legal knowledge to be able to search it. But we are available in libraries and public locations around the world. But I do think at the end of the day, the whole point is to make the law applicable and fair to others so that we can establish contracts or establish access to the legal system in an automated way. I think the smart contract opportunity is where you go into those places where it's harder to create a legal contract. You don't have access to a lawyer or a legal system to enforce it by engaging with the smart contract and putting it in a decentralized network, protects it, and then having an agreed upon oracle, which lawyers and law firms use to make decisions, can bring contracts and some of the legal aspects to places where it's harder to.
00:11:02.370 - 00:11:24.886, Speaker A: Know. Honestly, I guess I don't really know, but it almost sounds like an automation of something that effectively the system is already doing right. I mean, you're kind of already serving, I think, as an oracle in the real world. It's just that there's a manual process. Right. I mean, the same concept is happening. It's just happening with people looking into your database online or wherever they're access or going to the library or whatever else.
00:11:24.886 - 00:11:38.140, Speaker A: Right. So this is effectively probably an opportunity for them to just kind of codify that process. So are there efficiency gains there as well? I mean, it sounds like that's probably a fairly labor intensive operation today.
00:11:38.510 - 00:12:56.200, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. And I think a lot of times contracts get signed and put into a drawer and not looked at again in the real world, I think. And of course, having an automated process to monitor that contract constantly and ensure that it is executed on time and fairly. Even in today's world, where it's done between two legal parties and a physical paper or document, I think there are still advantages of doing it in an electronic way and in an automated way. It ensures execution and timely execution, and also ensures that there's an agreed upon, an agreed upon process to determine whether the contract is fair. And you can also have a lot of follow on arguments in the real world on contracts, on who's right and who's wrong. And so it does create a lot of time into the system.
00:12:56.200 - 00:13:18.700, Speaker B: But I think smart contracts are definitely an efficiency play because all things are agreed upon up front and it's fully automated. I think it'll make the speed of the contracts process a lot faster, I believe.
00:13:19.630 - 00:14:03.450, Speaker A: So maybe one last question. I'm just kind of curious. People ask me this all the time, so I'm going to put you on the spot and ask you. People ask me, is this demand driven or supply driven? Meaning, are we all sitting in a room and inventing these ideas and hoping that if we build that, the world will come to us? Right? Or do we actually see people? When you decided that you wanted to get into blockchain, was that because you were getting dozens and dozens of phone calls or. I'm just really curious how you see the evolution so far where we are in the process. Is it the first inning, is it the second inning? And again, why today? Why is this an exciting area for you guys to be in today from that perspective?
00:14:04.750 - 00:15:19.426, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, that's an interesting question. Well, the way my firm works and the way we work is we serve our customers. Our customers predominantly are our lawyers and law firms, also hedge funds, anywhere where there's a lawyer involved. And we have this saying it's customer first at LexusNexis and we've been observing lately a lot of law firms and legal groups are entering into the smart contract arena, and I think there's an increasingly large number of smart contract deals occurring with our customers, and we get a lot of questions about it. I think it's important for us to listen to our customers. I view my role as trying to be forward thinking and try to be, I try to be where my customers are going to be in a year or two years or five years from now so that we have the information that they need and the tools that they need to do their job.
00:15:19.426 - 00:16:06.740, Speaker B: And I think as smart contracts grow, which I think they will continue to grow in use right now, they're highly financial service driven, but the use cases are growing now that they've reached into the law firms. I want to be able to provide the services and the information to my customers so that they can be confident and be comfortable because they're already used LexisNexis today with their physical paper contracts and decision making, that we also be a part of the new contracts environment that is growing in the legal space. That's great.
00:16:09.670 - 00:16:27.750, Speaker A: I think I've cheated. I think I've actually gone us a little over time, unfortunately. But the reality is we could talk about this for hours. So I really appreciate you joining us today. I think it's fantastic to see you entering the space, and I really can't wait to see some of the cool applications that people are going to build on top of your infrastructure.
00:16:28.090 - 00:16:29.830, Speaker B: Thanks, William. Thanks for having me.
00:16:29.900 - 00:16:31.320, Speaker A: Thanks so much for joining us.
00:16:32.010 - 00:16:43.980, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Richard McFarland. William Hercorath it's really heartening, at least to me, to see lawyers and legal data providers enter the space with their curiosity and moving forward with that as well.
