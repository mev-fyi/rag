00:00:07.440 - 00:01:03.280, Speaker A: Hey everyone. So I'm going to give just a brief introduction on synthetics in case anyone's not familiar, and then we'll do a bit of a walkthrough of the system. So synthetics is a synthetic asset platform. On Ethereum, essentially what we allow people to do is have exposure to a bunch of different assets, crypto assets, fiat currencies, commodities, et cetera, and hold them on ethereum as a synthetic asset without having exposure or having to hold the underlying asset. So for example, we've got a gold token, so you can hold that token and it essentially represents the price of 1oz of gold without having to actually have possibly the gold itself. And we've got some more, I guess, exotic assets that we just launched recently. So we've got an index of exchange tokens.
00:01:03.280 - 00:01:51.008, Speaker A: So if you're really into centralized exchanges or shorting them, we've got an index of BNB, Leo, Hobby, OPEC and Kucoin. So if you think that that sector of the token industry is overvalued, you can basically buy a token that will give you inverse exposure. So if the price goes down, value of the token goes up, or vice versa, you can hold the token and if it goes up, then prices of the token will go up. And the way that this works is similar to maker. So maker, you lock ETH into CDP and then you issue a synthetic US dollar or die against it. Our system works very similarly. So you've got our token, which is SX.
00:01:51.008 - 00:02:30.704, Speaker A: You lost that token and you issue debt in the system. The big difference is that at the moment we have using price feed, so the chain link conversation, the ability to reprice that debt. So you can start with debt that's priced in US dollars and you can convert it into synthetic bitcoin or these other assets. So we'll just do a quick walkthrough of the system. So this is minter, which is our CDP creator, if you will. So this is where holders of the SNX token can go to lock their SNX and issue new debt. So we'll connect by metamask here.
00:02:30.704 - 00:03:17.612, Speaker A: So you've got a balance of SNX, which is worth about $30,000. So this is on coven? I think so, yeah. We've got roughly $30,000 worth of collateral that's in this wallet and against that collateral we're going to issue some debt. So I think at the moment we've got about $2,000 worth of debt that's already owed and there's about $4,000 worth of debt in this wallet. So the collateralization ratio here, if you're familiar with maker, you know that maker has the target threshold is 150%. So if you fall below 150% collateralized, you'll get liquidated with us. Our target is 750%, so it's a lot larger buffer.
00:03:17.612 - 00:04:08.396, Speaker A: And the reason for that is obviously even a lot more liquid than SNX. And so there's more risk with the SNX token of the value dropping or moving. It's a more volatile asset. So what we're going to do is we're going to go and mint some new debt in the form of f two C, and we're going to essentially lower that collateralization ratio to 750, which is the target rate that we've got in the network. So hopefully, COVID go quickly for us. Okay, so basically what we've done is we've. From Zero X address, we just created this new suSC.
00:04:08.396 - 00:04:44.504, Speaker A: So it's been minted and it's now in the wallet. And if we go back, you can see that the debt that's owed is now $4,000. So in order for you to release all the collateral and be able to fully transfer it again, you'd need to burn that $4,000. So that's kind of, I guess, the basic mechanics of issuing debt into the system, but that's not really the point of the system. So the point of the system is to allow people to have exposure to these different assets. Right? So, okay, great. You've got sod now, which is tracks the US dollar.
00:04:44.504 - 00:05:24.170, Speaker A: But if we go over to synthetics exchange, we can see where the good stuff on top happens. So we'll connect to synthetics exchange. And you can see this wallet has a bunch of different things in it. You've been trading a lot, it looks like. So we've got an inverse tazos token, right? So it's a bit bearish on tezos here. We've got some gold, we've got some USD, and we've got some bitcoin. And so basically, all of these different assets are tracking the prices via a price fee, by an oracle fee being pushed into.
00:05:24.170 - 00:06:09.528, Speaker A: So what we're going to do is we are going to buy the centralized exchange token. So if we go down here. So we're long Leo, I guess, at this point. And the centralized exchange token is a basket of tokens that tracks about $1,000 price target. So it's made up of a certain number of units of each of the different tokens that constitute the basket and the price target is about launch at about $1,000. So down to about 950. So maybe we should actually buy the inverse one if the market's going the other direction on this.
00:06:09.528 - 00:06:56.608, Speaker A: So we can buy with $1,000, the inverse centralized exchange token. So if you want to go ahead and do that transaction. And so essentially what's happening here is the contracts are taking the SUSD and burning it. So taking that debt that exists in the system and burning that value, and then it's going to issue this new inverse centralized exchange token. So basically we've sent the USD, and then we've minted the new value of the centralized exchange token. And then down here, there's another transaction which is happening, which is the fees. So the exchange charges fees.
00:06:56.608 - 00:07:47.636, Speaker A: And this is how the minters, the people in the system who are providing the collateral and who are collateralizing the network, are rewarded. So for every single exchange that happens, there's a 30 basis point fee that's charged and that's paid to collectively the pool of people that are staking the network. So they're the ones that are essentially taking the risk and facilitating the transaction and allowing people to. Yeah, if we go back to Mintu, you can see in rewards there. So on a weekly basis, all of the fees are pooled and based on your proportion of the debt, so based on how much value you've created in the system, you're able to claim your fees. So, looks like we've got about $11 worth of fees to be collected here. And then on top of that, we also have an inflationary supply.
00:07:47.636 - 00:09:04.292, Speaker A: So that's in the early phases, as we're bootstrapping, as we're waiting for the transactions on the network to be sufficient to incentivize people to stake. We've got this inflationary supply, so you're basically paid in SNX tokens for taking this risk right now. And that inflation, over time of the next four years declines. And eventually we hope to get to a point where the actual transaction fees themselves are sufficient to secure the network. So, yeah, we'll claim those rewards, and then we've got more collateral. So we've got some SUsD that's been claimed from the people, as well as this inflationary supply that will increase the collateral value of the wallet and can be admitted against. And so I guess the intent here is that you have something similar to uniswap in that you've got this pooled collateral model where anyone sitting here can go and purchase debt and can trade against the contract, essentially, so all of the people who are staking SNX, providing collateral, are this pooled counterparty.
00:09:04.292 - 00:09:58.732, Speaker A: So we're all sitting over here saying, anyone who turns up the contract can trade with as much value as they've got in debt and can reprice that debt, and we will act as a counterparty to those trades, and we're rewarded with fees from the transactions, the same way that liquidity providers in uniswap put up ETH and tokens and allow you to trade against that and then collect the fees from those trades. Yeah, so this ratio is a little bit higher, and he can mint again if he wants. And so I guess at the moment, we've got about 30 different assets that you can trade. So a bunch of different cryptocurrencies. So you can see on synthetics exchange. If we just head back over there, that's the list of all the assets. So you've got some fiat currencies, commodities, crypto, and then now some indexes.
00:09:58.732 - 00:11:17.690, Speaker A: But eventually the idea is that we'll also have things like synthetic Tesla. So if someone doesn't have access to a brokerage account so they're in an emerging market, or for whatever reason, they can't access a broker, they would be able to, theoretically, provided they've got ETH, come to synthetics exchange and get access to Tesla or apple or some other equity, or potentially even like the S and P 500. And the way that that works is that the counterparties, the SMX holders who are providing collateral, would essentially act as the counterparty to those traits to allow people to access these more traditional assets, and then against those assets, they would hedge them. So in order to, I guess, maintain that equilibrium within the network, us who have brokerage accounts, who could potentially act as market makers, are able to keep the system in check, essentially, and we're paid a fee for that. So over time, we expect that there'll be a whole bunch of different assets, indexes, traditional assets, cryptocurrencies, et cetera. And anyone in the world who's got access to ETH, who's got ethereum wallet, will be able to get exposure to those assets. So that's it.
00:11:17.690 - 00:11:19.690, Speaker A: Any questions?
00:11:26.060 - 00:11:27.290, Speaker B: Can I look up on.
00:11:28.960 - 00:11:36.530, Speaker A: It's actually SNX. So it's our token. And that token drives value from the fee. So there's a fee yield from that.
00:11:38.820 - 00:12:28.380, Speaker B: When the first bitcoin was, there was the headline from the New York Times, like Banston Bridge bailout. Pretty much the mechanism that blockchains and cryptocurrency wanted to move if I'm at the user on platform. Once get cultured, some token already on the. I can buy it here, but holding anything on the. So that you would have like virtually inflated. And therefore, then if you get enough traction, you will effectively get an inflation even in deflationary token.
00:12:28.540 - 00:13:27.300, Speaker A: Yeah, that's actually a good point. So the question was, what's the impact on the actual spot market? Right? What's the impact on a token market if you're creating these derivatives that are synthetic, that are not sort of tied to the actual underlying collateral? And I mean, I think we have that in traditional markets like the gold spot market is much smaller than the futures market. I guess the question then is, does that introduce risk into the system? I suppose the way that the system is sort of calibrated is that the debt is capped by the value of the collateral. So the collateral constrains the supply, so it can't just infinitely expand and we can't increase the value of the collateral unless there's more activity being captured. So it's a little bit like backing derivatives based on the actual transactions happening on the derivatives exchange. So it's somewhat circular, but it is also constrained in what you can accomplish.
00:13:31.160 - 00:13:58.392, Speaker B: And then I will lock up on my snacks, which decreases the supply of SNX, and it will drive up the price of SNX token and it will effectively drive down the price of whatever I'm giving myself exposure to because I will then be able to sell this in the market. These tokens, as an alternative to actual unlikely tokens also represents. And you're kind of inflating the supply of any kind of asset, potentially.
00:13:58.456 - 00:14:57.520, Speaker A: But because the price is derived from a price feed from the spot market, it's somewhat hard for the derivatives market in this case to kind of feed back into that because it's not a counterparty based market. In the example of Tesla, let'S say. Right, so TesLa, there's a certain number of people that have access to buying Tesla in the world, and this would expand the amount of people that could access Tesla potentially. Right. The question, I guess, is would it sort of cannibalize the existing demand for Tesla in the spot market? I think we see in the gold market that that doesn't really happen. Right? Like the futures market is still driven by the spot market. Same thing with Oil.
00:14:57.520 - 00:15:27.060, Speaker A: The things that are being traded on spot markets are constrained by reality, right? We're just taking feed from that counterparty based market and then allowing people to have access to those ten assets. So yes, potentially in the long term, there could be some feedback mechanism between the two, but I don't know that it necessarily spirals out into some kind of huge inflation of the supply of that asset because of the way that the prices are drived.
00:15:28.120 - 00:15:28.870, Speaker B: AlL.
00:15:48.900 - 00:16:20.556, Speaker A: Again, if you take the example of Tesla and imagine that right now, the latent demand in the existing market for people who want to hold Tesla is X. Right. And if we expand that to every single human who can access an Ethereum wallet, maybe it's two x, three x, whatever. How does that feed back into the spot market? It's through the market makers who are sitting on the other side trying to hedge. Right. So if this significantly decouples from the spot market, then they'll go into the spot market and buy. But obviously you need massive scale and we're not there.
00:16:20.556 - 00:16:21.710, Speaker A: It's still early.
00:16:25.280 - 00:16:29.100, Speaker B: I was just wondering if you guys had many issues from a regulatory perspective.
00:16:30.720 - 00:17:15.260, Speaker A: Yeah. When we're talking about providing access to regulated assets like equities and things like that, then, yeah, that becomes potentially problematic. We have some level of permissioning in the system at the moment, so we provide the oracles, but obviously we're here to kind of get away from that a little bit and decentralize that. I think there is some level, some sufficient level of decentralization where it's running on Ethereum. The oracles are decentralized, the governance of the protocol is decentralized, and you can somewhat avoid regulatory issues. One of the reasons why we've been able to avoid it to date is that we're not matching counterparts. So we're not providing a trading venue per se.
00:17:15.260 - 00:17:33.570, Speaker A: The debt never leaves your wallet. So you've got debt priced in gold and then you just reprice it in silver. There's no order matching going on there. We're not the counterparty. Yeah, exactly. So that's how we kind of avoid it for the short term. Once you start listing Tesla and Apple and things like that, then it becomes interesting.
00:17:33.570 - 00:18:09.384, Speaker A: That's a really good question. So you can imagine you've got this venue where people can bring debt and they can trade that debt, but they need to be able to get in and out. Right. And so you need a bridge between Ethereum and this debt market. And the way that we've set that up is through Uniswap. So we've got the fourth largest pool in Uniswap, similar to wrapped ETH, where people use that as a bridge to get into some of the lending protocols and what have you. Our synthetic e is matched in uniswap.
00:18:09.384 - 00:18:20.796, Speaker A: To e, and we've got about, I think, 5000 e on either side of that pool. So you can move sort of $10,000 with pretty low slippage in and out of the pool.
00:18:20.908 - 00:18:24.752, Speaker B: So if I have synthetic yeast and I want to move it out, I can withdraw, actually.
00:18:24.886 - 00:18:49.000, Speaker A: Correct? Yeah, there's the bi directional breach that way. I mean, again, it's still fairly liquid, but if it's ten or 20 grand, then it's usually pretty good. So if you want to go out for like, three months, that's kind of the growth of the pool over the last three months as we've incentivized people to put ETH into this uniswap pool.
00:18:52.400 - 00:19:04.032, Speaker B: If I understand correctly, you are the market maker right now. So you're on the other side. Like, it's kind of like if everyone just goes and buys Tesla, you try to hedge it equalize the market.
00:19:04.166 - 00:19:27.210, Speaker A: So we're not. So all of the token holders are. So collectively, there's about 1000 people that are minting right now. We don't have those equities yet, so there's no real need to kind of hedge out into the spot market. But eventually, over the long term, yeah, we would need market makers that were essentially hedging their exposure to the pool of debt in the system, external to the system.
00:19:29.980 - 00:19:39.352, Speaker B: It sounds like you can get into this trade, doesn't have to be another party to take that. So the market itself could be directional.
00:19:39.416 - 00:19:39.884, Speaker A: Correct.
00:19:40.002 - 00:19:51.070, Speaker B: Within the system, if you have a small number of people supporting the market makers, they can become directional in the opposite direction, correct?
00:19:54.400 - 00:19:55.150, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:19:56.240 - 00:19:58.424, Speaker B: How do you kind of deal with the stress?
00:19:58.472 - 00:20:45.160, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess if you sort of imagine in a traditional market, it's like you've got this clearinghouse, right, and you're internalizing all of the flow through that clearinghouse and not kind of hedging it externally. One way we avoid that is there's just a large buffer. So I think the second largest asset is ETH. The other way is that most of the assets being held are crypto, and SNX is also crypto, so they're highly correlated. But eventually, over time, as we launch the next version, there will be kind of built in balancing mechanisms. So if you have a position open in bitcoin, for example, there'll be a margin cost to maintain that position, and then we'll like a futures exchange, pay people who are taking the other side of that. But ultimately, there still needs to be some hedging outside the system.
00:20:45.160 - 00:20:55.410, Speaker A: And we expect as the system scales, that more sophisticated market makers will come in and take that over. Because if you're just sitting there internalizing the flow, then eventually you're at risk. Right.
00:20:56.020 - 00:20:58.700, Speaker B: So you're hoping that big institutional investors.
00:20:58.780 - 00:21:19.050, Speaker A: Come in or even crypto hedge funds, crypto market makers. There's fairly sophisticated actors in the market now already that I think would be able to, if not perfectly hedge, at least hedge enough that the trading fees would be sufficient to offset the risk. That's the idea. Cool. Okay, thanks very much. Run through this.
