00:00:08.410 - 00:00:16.000, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. We have an awesome team here joining us today. Here for chainlinks q A. We have cyber Kongs, we have Sebs and inverted guys. Welcome.
00:00:16.610 - 00:00:17.070, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:17.140 - 00:00:17.566, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:17.668 - 00:00:19.022, Speaker B: Thank you for having us.
00:00:19.156 - 00:00:21.950, Speaker C: Yeah, hey, thanks, guys.
00:00:22.020 - 00:00:38.780, Speaker A: You guys have been all over the headlines, I feel like. So it's really great to have you joining us today. So for people who are in the audience, some may know about you, some may not know about you, do you mind expanding a little bit on who you guys are and what inspired the project?
00:00:41.230 - 00:01:26.790, Speaker B: Yeah. So at the core of what we are is a social avatar brand that focuses on lifestyle, tech and innovation. So between starting out almost 13 months ago now back in March of last year, it started as a COVID relief project by Mio, the original artist. I dropped 1000 monkeys on an open sea storefront contract and a month later we had our own migration. A couple of months later we had our VX drop. But overall, we're pretty much stewards in the space, trying to be builders, innovators and keep pushing things forward while embracing a family like lifestyle brand.
00:01:29.150 - 00:01:47.870, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it seems like you've been able to build something special from that community element to it. You were mentioning family brand inverted. Curious. From your perspective, how have you guys managed to foster such a sense of community in the NFT space and even just web3 more broadly?
00:01:48.770 - 00:02:27.418, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it honestly started with our origins. The way that Cyber Kong sold 0.1 at the time. It basically random Joe who just made listings and people kind of got behind it. It's always been extremely community based. Even the team that works on it is all OGs from the original minting days who said, hey, there's more here, we should do something. And even our original holders were a lot of OG punks, OG cryptokitties, people like myself, just OG in the space in general.
00:02:27.418 - 00:02:48.720, Speaker B: That kind of came together and said, hey, this is something before that was a thing to do even. I mean, there wasn't even a standard for how many in a collection there should be like this whole idea that 10,000 or whatever that was. Months after that we launched that. It even became a thing.
00:02:49.410 - 00:03:18.842, Speaker C: Yeah, just, just to iterate on that, I think. Well, a lot has changed in the last year, definitely. But yeah, I think also whenever we build anything, it's always community driven. It's community first. We're always looking for ways to kind of enable our community to have extended value and also not just value for the short term because cybercons and all is a long term goal. Right. I mean, we have a 510 year goal and we want to keep sustained value.
00:03:18.842 - 00:03:29.040, Speaker C: We're not about just doing quick hypes like flash in the pan. We really try and make sure that the community has as much value as we can possibly give them.
00:03:31.650 - 00:04:09.580, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think building on that point, right, the value, it seems like there's been a shift in focus or maybe an expansion of the focus around utility in NFT collections or just building communities in general. So if we were to switch gears, moving off of how we've talked about building this community and into how do we build off of a strong base, how do you guys view the importance of utility in the collections, broadly speaking? And how does your community view the delivery of utility as you guys continue to innovate within the space?
00:04:11.710 - 00:04:57.526, Speaker C: Well, I mean, we've always, from the beginning, I think there was maybe one or two weeks in the beginning of Cyberkongs where it wasn't utility focused. But ever since then it's just been making sure that we can always hit the know and always try to push something innovative, something new. I mean, just off the top of my head now, we recently released the Guardian contract, which is essentially two Fa on chain completely for your Cybercount Fox. We released playing collect. Now it's using Chainlink, VRF, also completely on chain. And these are just some of the smaller innovations that we've been pushing. I mean, obviously there's banana token and we've got so many things that we've got in the works.
00:04:57.526 - 00:05:02.126, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, yeah, I think.
00:05:02.148 - 00:06:15.300, Speaker B: I'd follow up and say that even between March of last year and now, we didn't start as a utility brand by any means. And now literally everything in the system has utility. But at the same time, the market overall, I don't know that it has still held to that mentality because for, I want to say until maybe the end of January, beginning of January timeline, a lot of, we'll say what matters relied on utility, whereas now it's almost like things are shifting a bit and going more into, I mean, I don't want to call it just hype, but we'll just say the brand exposure, the brand messaging of it almost. So it's an interesting thing to kind of witness and just see how it's all changed and where it's going. Us being a community project and always flexible and malleable, it's led us to make some changes in regards to where things are going just for the space. And as more and more mass adoption happens, I mean, it's just natural with the space as things grow.
00:06:16.950 - 00:06:34.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just curious, what do you see to be driving that shift? I mean, maybe it's just like an opinion, but what are you observing that's pushing teams to think about the exposure piece on top of the utility or maybe sometimes in lieu of that, I.
00:06:34.208 - 00:07:52.242, Speaker B: Think personally it's one of those where it's always easier to say something is going to happen than to do something. So I'm not saying that teams are making empty promises or anything like that, but at the same time, making a promise for a year to two to five years out from now is a lot easier and has longer hype than just delivering. So it's one of those where also the type of people, to be frank, who are entering the markets these days with the recent, not so recent anymore, but just the increased news coverage of NFTs and crypto in general and oh my gosh, people are making millions and lambo this, Lambo that. You have a lot of people who are in the space just to monetize rather than to actually build too. And there's always going to be an inflow, outflow of that. But right now I think we have in the space in general, a big kind of outflow, I'll say, of people taking profits, which then of course just affect everything. So it's interesting to see how the hype aspect of it, because people follow volume as far as trying to trade and things like that.
00:07:52.242 - 00:08:36.340, Speaker B: So the people who are coming into the space and have came into the space recently, not all of them, of course, but I think most of them will follow those because they know or think that's where going to be the volume is. So it's almost like the psychology of the market has shifted to whitelists are the only way to quote unquote, make money anymore is what people think. So either I get the whitelist or I flip where the volume is. So it's just kind of a weird dichotomy that we're going through of Ying and yang, of builders and flippers, because there's always, with any collectible market, physical or digital, there's always going to be just pure profiteers. But you need those people to facilitate deals too.
00:08:36.870 - 00:08:52.440, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think it expands on the evolution of inverted. What you're saying says what you're saying in terms of the community element. Right. And that's why I think what we see effective teams doing is building that strong sense of community so that.
00:08:56.250 - 00:08:56.566, Speaker B: It.
00:08:56.588 - 00:09:31.060, Speaker A: Helps protect itself because of that family dynamic and the power of the shared values in a way. And so while communities are made up by a whole bunch of different people, it's also important to figure out, or at least shepherd newcomers right to what communities for them. And so we see it with NFTs, we see it with companies around the world, with corporate culture. That element, I think is super important. So it's interesting to see how you're viewing it and how you guys are defining it for Cyber Kong as well.
00:09:31.830 - 00:09:51.020, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of it for us is continuing to build that family value. Being a Kong isn't about the assets you own, but how you hold yourself in the space. So it's continuing to push that narrative. Know all one big family, just like the.
00:09:53.070 - 00:10:19.378, Speaker A: So, you know, Sebs, you were mentioning a bit earlier, just to rewind a little bit on the utility piece, right? You were talking about a game recently and you mentioned that you were leveraging, or you are leveraging chainlink VRF in some way. So just curious to shift gears a little bit. Do you mind expanding a little bit on the recent developments there and what people are most excited about in the community around this game?
00:10:19.544 - 00:11:27.240, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know if we really internally like to think of playing collect as a game per se. It's more of a gamified minting experience or gamified Defi. We've kind of taken the aspects of using VRF which gives you completely random thing. We've also brought in game logic. And in this process of playing the game, you're being rewarded through NFTs, through banana token, through kongium, for example, I think what I've noticed that people are really enjoying the most is when it comes, I mean, it's not just stake your Cyberkong VX and then it just makes you money, right? There's actually some strategy involved. And I think for a lot of people, they bumped their heads a few times and kind of stopped. But for those who have really pushed through this kind of learning period and this part of like, what's this season's meta, they're the ones who are really seeing a lot of value from this and from seeing things like weapon drops that we're doing in the game now, which have so much potential for the future.
00:11:27.240 - 00:11:58.082, Speaker C: Also, we've got at the moment, it's like the Kong's merchandise with uniquely everyone's super excited for essentially free merchandise. Because, I mean, as much as you can spend banana to play the game, you can also do free runs every day. So it's giving access to the small holders, but also giving access to. If someone wants to drop 1000 bananas on the game. That's great. That's cool for them. They're going to get to level up their VX and really get ahead quick.
00:11:58.082 - 00:12:06.660, Speaker C: But it is accessible for everyone. And I think that accessibility is definitely something that we're trying to make available.
00:12:07.450 - 00:12:15.254, Speaker A: Absolutely. It's super important. Right. So what helps bring more crypto curious people into the fold? And it's the accessibility to your point.
00:12:15.452 - 00:13:15.450, Speaker C: Yeah, and I mean, this is really just the beginning. We always said this was the foundation that we're going to build this house on kind of thing. So for example, we've got this, we have the yield hub, we have the lock registry as well. There are so many things that we can go so deep into with the underlying tech here. But the really cool thing is essentially what this means with play and collect is if a partner or a project or something comes to us and they say, hey, we want to give you X amount of tokens or X amount of NFTs for your community to get them amped, we can say, that's great, let's distribute them through pay and collect. Because the cool thing about play and collect is we can push any ERC 20 or ERC 721 straight through play and collect. Someone goes out on a run, they win their snft and then they've essentially minted it for the cost of whatever banana it cost them, which is generally a hell of a lot lower than a mint price normally.
00:13:15.450 - 00:13:25.806, Speaker C: It's just a fun, different take on staking and minting. I think that's what people are most excited about.
00:13:25.828 - 00:14:08.220, Speaker A: That's what I want. I think it's super cool to see how the tech comes together, right? Because I think you guys are doing something different, you're doing something new, and seeing how can we use basically the tools at our disposal within this new wave of technology to create innovative experiences that people might not have seen before. And so having different incentives, giving different offerings, different utility, who knows what people want, right? And so that's the whole beauty of the open source dynamic. Right? And then it's a quick learning curve. We could figure out where the puck could go based off of people's interactions and stuff like that. Inverted, curious. Anything you want to add on that?
00:14:10.050 - 00:14:14.000, Speaker B: No, I think he did a great job of covering it.
00:14:14.850 - 00:14:16.958, Speaker C: I can speak, play and collect for hours.
00:14:17.124 - 00:15:03.280, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, it's the idea that in the future of NFTs, and just like the minting experience in general, it shouldn't be stuck to gas wars and whitelists and things like that it should be a situation where. And correct me if I'm wrong here, Sebs, but eventually we can open the PNK system up to the public where you don't even have to be a holder. You just basically operate under different conditions, doing adventure runs or a different adventure module or something like that. So it's one of those where we're still early with it, we're still working out some kinks, making sure everything goes well. Honestly, things have been. I'm not a dev head, so don't quote me on this end, but things have gone swimmingly well.
00:15:03.280 - 00:15:24.740, Speaker B: We've had no real major issues. Obviously, Chainlink has been awesome as far as keeping up on the requests there. I know we've been pushing through quite a few. I know that's all good on our end, and I know that our people are happy to see where the future of it is.
00:15:25.670 - 00:15:40.250, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you mind if we expand a little bit? Inverter, you mentioned Chainlink again, just to help the users understand or the viewers understand a little bit more around where VRF actually comes into the picture in this whole gamified experience. Maybe Seb's, whoever.
00:15:40.670 - 00:15:43.740, Speaker B: Of course. Yeah, Sebs, I'll let you have that one.
00:15:46.430 - 00:16:30.474, Speaker C: So, pretty much what happens is the whole idea of the game is that we're going to just call it a game. It's what it is. So the whole idea is that you send a crew of one to five Cybercon Vx out on these runs, right? While they're doing these runs, pretty much what's happening is we're querying the VRF for Chainlink. We're waiting for the Oracle to come back with an answer for us. And then once we get that answer, that determines what rewards you win for the game. It determines the amount of loot you have, and it determines which kind of. Well, there's also the logic with how many boxes you hold, but that still plays a part in which events you hit as well, which obviously all determine things.
00:16:30.474 - 00:17:02.914, Speaker C: And then we're not just using it in the adventure runs, but we use it as well in the process. When baby kongs, which yield charms for boosting adventures, when they claim these charms, you have a one in three choice of getting. You have low, medium, legendary kind of charms. So Chainlink is playing a part here. The same goes for even something as small as the NFT voucher for the merchandise. Right. You have a one or two chance of getting something.
00:17:02.914 - 00:17:22.600, Speaker C: So we've really, I think, utilized chain link exceptionally well from my standpoint. And I think we've really integrated it extremely nicely. And it's really cool to actually be able to start to use web3 technologies because I've always been super excited about Chainlink and it's really cool to actually be working with the tech now.
00:17:23.230 - 00:18:13.580, Speaker A: Yeah, man. Absolutely. I think it's something I feel like I take for granted in my day to day is just like the inherent randomness in whatever we do. Like just driving to get gas or petrol, whatever the cars you pass, all of this stuff. It's important to have that whimsical nature of those outcomes, right? And I think it's interesting to see from what you're sharing how it comes to life in the experiences that you guys are building. So I appreciate you guys sharing. So to build off of that a little bit, where do you see things going from here? Maybe not no need for an alpha leak on Cyberkongs, but more so, generally speaking, for the NFT space at large, where do you see things potentially heading when it comes to community building or even utility, broadly speaking?
00:18:16.750 - 00:19:08.906, Speaker C: All right, I'll take this one as well. Look, I'm so wrapped up in cybercoms at the moment, this is just my main focus. I do obviously look out, look outside, see what's happening around. But this is really the majority of my focus. But in an ideal world, right, what I would personally love to see, let me change the question a bit. What I would love to see is more community driven initiatives and more projects that really begin to kind of embrace the web3 culture, the decentralization. Obviously, I'm going to speak about Kong's now, but for example, with Kong's tank, right, with things like doing a bounty on extending play and collect, we have great community initiatives that are happening behind the scenes as well.
00:19:08.906 - 00:20:00.570, Speaker C: And it's not just in Kong's, it's in so many other small communities where I see this happening. So I really hope and that the whole space starts adapting this mindset, right? Because as much as it's up to the devs to give utility, and it's up to so many other aspects of it to enable utility, there's also, I believe, a community utility aspect behind NFTs that I think a lot of people actually take for granted, right? Because everyone's just so infatuated with technology. Next best thing this bigger, better, whatever. But I think community utility is definitely something that I hope that's where this space goes. Because if it doesn't then, and we don't go decentralized, then we're pretty much back in that corporate mindset. And I thought we were trying to steer away from that. That's personally my take on it.
00:20:00.570 - 00:20:04.400, Speaker C: I don't know if Inverter has anything else to add there.
00:20:04.770 - 00:20:42.860, Speaker B: No, that's a great way to label it community utility. Right. And thankfully that is kind of what started informed Kong's. I'll say. We've done things, not even intentionally, a little backwards. Know, most projects launching today aiming to be a brand, a lifestyle, a vibe, any of it ours, has been formed and upheld by the community itself. And to be frank, any NFT, any collectible, anything with value is nothing without the people who believe that it has value.
00:20:42.860 - 00:21:24.626, Speaker B: And a lot of that regardless. I mean, people pick where they want to live because of the people who live in that area. So it's the same thing with collectibles and NFTs and all of it. The people utility is the people itself. So I definitely think that moving forward, maintaining that we focus our brand on the people rather than the what, we focus on the why. We're not out here trying to make AA games and we're not out here things of that nature, just trying to produce, produce, produce. We're trying to integrate, integrate, integrate.
00:21:24.626 - 00:22:26.860, Speaker B: Which I think is a little bit of a different take than a lot of projects too. Not that others don't do partnerships and things of that nature, but I think we just have a little bit different focus. And seeing the VX in Grand Theft Auto recently has just been a huge push as far as community be like, oh well, okay, maybe I should go download grand Theft auto and just do these bike races. You're literally hitting like five buttons going forward, left or right, and gas or brake. And people are now wanting to download this game like join in the streams and that's the community utility. And obviously all of those people could have just downloaded GTA and played that normally, right? But the main drive behind that was the commonality behind the ownership of their asset and wanting to utilize that and enjoy it. So I think the future is pretty bright in regards to not only the NFT space, but Kongs as a whole.
00:22:29.230 - 00:23:17.274, Speaker A: Yeah, man, absolutely. I mean, I think that you touch on some interesting points. I think the emphasis on the community, the people, is something that is really strong in what you've been sharing today. And the whole industry at large is providing that platform for people to find their nook or cranny of web3 and really lean into exactly who they want to be or what they want to do. And so I appreciate you guys coming on today to share what you guys are doing or how you view providing the platform or the tools for people to do exactly what we're talking about. Right. Be, I guess, their full self in a way via the communities that they're part of.
00:23:17.274 - 00:23:24.640, Speaker A: So just to wrap up for the people listening in today, where can people find you and learn more about what you're working on?
00:23:26.130 - 00:23:40.290, Speaker C: Well, definitely through Twitter at cybercom's website, cyberkongs.com. I mean, the discord as well, but you can get that from Twitter. So that's pretty much, I think, Twitter centralized.
00:23:41.270 - 00:24:10.234, Speaker B: Yeah, we have a YouTube channel, has some good videos on there that talks about, like play and collect some of the randomization that goes on, just some walkthroughs about the general community because it's one of those where we've been around for 1314 months now and there's a lot to it. So take your time, dive in, check it out, hop in the discord, say hello. We're all friendly. Yeah.
00:24:10.272 - 00:24:31.102, Speaker A: Just meeting people where they're at. Right. However they want to learn or figure things out. So I think that's great, guys. So look, really appreciate you guys taking the time today to share your point of view, share where you see things going, helping people learn a little bit more about what you're working on. It's been great to have you. And to the general community who's dialing in today watching the video, there's more to come.
00:24:31.102 - 00:24:37.366, Speaker A: So feel free to, like, subscribe, comment what you'd like to see more, and we look forward to seeing you next time. Thanks, guys.
00:24:37.548 - 00:24:39.062, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks so much.
00:24:39.196 - 00:24:39.940, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
