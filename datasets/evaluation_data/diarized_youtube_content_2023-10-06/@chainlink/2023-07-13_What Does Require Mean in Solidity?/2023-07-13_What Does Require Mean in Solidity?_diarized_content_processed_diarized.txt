00:00:00.570 - 00:00:31.560, Speaker A: So what exactly does require do? Let's find out. Require is a key word in solidity. You can think of it kind of like an if it evaluates to a boolean and throws an error if the evaluation is false. So what does it look like? Let's see. You can see the require statement has an evaluation of the message sender's balance versus one ETH. In this example, we're checking to see if the message send the person who calls this function has at least one ETH in their wallet. If they do, we emit the event.
00:00:31.560 - 00:00:42.370, Speaker A: It's that simple. So why wouldn't I just use an if well require returns? The gas that's not used in my smart contract. That's why you should put the require as early as you can in a contract.
