00:00:02.170 - 00:00:05.502, Speaker A: Provide, we take real world pricing data.
00:00:05.556 - 00:00:08.766, Speaker B: Some digital, mostly digital asset prices currently.
00:00:08.868 - 00:00:10.746, Speaker C: And we feed them into the chainic.
00:00:10.778 - 00:00:13.134, Speaker D: Network, so that the various applications, like.
00:00:13.172 - 00:00:15.758, Speaker E: For instance DeFi, can utilize that data.
00:00:15.924 - 00:00:19.566, Speaker F: Reliably and be basically provided with all.
00:00:19.588 - 00:00:24.270, Speaker B: Sorts of guarantees about the accuracy of the data. This is like how I will not.
00:00:24.420 - 00:00:26.358, Speaker G: Dive too much, too deep under the.
00:00:26.364 - 00:00:28.806, Speaker H: Hood, how that would work, or how.
00:00:28.828 - 00:00:30.162, Speaker C: That works on Chainlink.
00:00:30.306 - 00:00:33.494, Speaker A: So by doing so, as I said.
00:00:33.532 - 00:00:35.686, Speaker I: We help secure some value which is.
00:00:35.708 - 00:00:40.218, Speaker C: Locked on the application layer. So we are providing infrastructure, and then.
00:00:40.384 - 00:00:42.746, Speaker G: With that, some applications are based on.
00:00:42.768 - 00:00:45.226, Speaker C: That infrastructure and they rely on some.
00:00:45.248 - 00:00:47.766, Speaker D: Service which that infrastructure provides.
00:00:47.798 - 00:00:50.826, Speaker A: So currently the DFI, let's say the.
00:00:50.848 - 00:00:52.794, Speaker G: Value locked in DFI is 10.3 billion.
00:00:52.842 - 00:00:55.358, Speaker B: Which is a lot. Most of that, as far as I.
00:00:55.364 - 00:00:57.310, Speaker H: Understand, is powered by Chainlink.
00:00:58.850 - 00:01:01.930, Speaker F: So this is kind of our infrastructure.
00:01:02.010 - 00:01:03.226, Speaker H: Like if you look at this long.
00:01:03.268 - 00:01:06.514, Speaker F: Term or even currently, by providing the.
00:01:06.552 - 00:01:08.594, Speaker I: Data, we are actually monetizing a share.
00:01:08.632 - 00:01:11.246, Speaker G: Of DeFI usage and DeFi activity.
00:01:11.438 - 00:01:14.466, Speaker H: So from the infrastructure perspective, so we.
00:01:14.488 - 00:01:15.698, Speaker F: Are not as a corporate or as.
00:01:15.704 - 00:01:17.734, Speaker H: Deutsche Telecom, I find it very hard.
00:01:17.772 - 00:01:23.574, Speaker E: To imagine, at least right now, us playing an active role in DeFi on application level.
00:01:23.692 - 00:01:24.806, Speaker I: So what we can do, we can.
00:01:24.828 - 00:01:27.574, Speaker H: Utilize our experience and infrastructure to play.
00:01:27.612 - 00:01:30.458, Speaker E: It on an infrastructure level, while also.
00:01:30.544 - 00:01:33.242, Speaker I: Where some value on the application level.
00:01:33.296 - 00:01:35.494, Speaker D: Trickles down to the infrastructure providers.
00:01:35.542 - 00:01:37.558, Speaker B: So just like we see in, let's.
00:01:37.574 - 00:01:39.994, Speaker A: Say, proof of work mining, yes, with.
00:01:40.032 - 00:01:44.960, Speaker B: Ethereum, bitcoin, the fees are still low, but we might expect that to change in the future.
00:01:46.690 - 00:01:49.226, Speaker F: So we are thus participating in generalized mining.
00:01:49.258 - 00:01:51.470, Speaker A: And this is rather term, it was.
00:01:51.540 - 00:01:54.094, Speaker H: Initially coined by Jake Brookmann from Coin fund.
00:01:54.212 - 00:01:58.286, Speaker G: So we are with generalized mining. This is like a general term to.
00:01:58.308 - 00:02:00.046, Speaker B: Look at the space and saying we.
00:02:00.068 - 00:02:02.430, Speaker H: Are providing some kind of it service.
00:02:02.580 - 00:02:04.766, Speaker E: To a blockchain network or to like.
00:02:04.788 - 00:02:07.286, Speaker H: A set of anonymous actors, and then.
00:02:07.308 - 00:02:09.654, Speaker F: We are getting rewarded for doing so.
00:02:09.692 - 00:02:13.060, Speaker C: In a native digital asset of that network. And.
