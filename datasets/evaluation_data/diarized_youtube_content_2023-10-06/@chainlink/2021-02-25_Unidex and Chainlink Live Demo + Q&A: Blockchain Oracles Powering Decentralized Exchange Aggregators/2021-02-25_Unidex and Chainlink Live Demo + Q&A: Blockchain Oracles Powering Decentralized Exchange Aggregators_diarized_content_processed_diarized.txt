00:00:00.570 - 00:00:12.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I always thought that Houston was a little bit more boring than usual, but I guess it's good to see that they're not still stuck in traditional finance and they're moving into cryptocurrency development.
00:00:12.930 - 00:00:27.670, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool. Well, we can go ahead and get started. Welcome everyone. My name is Keenan Olsen. Really excited again to have Kumal joining us of Unidex, a really exciting platform. A little bit about the rundown today is we're going to do a live demo.
00:00:27.670 - 00:00:55.520, Speaker B: So this will be one of the first live demos that we've done. Be able to see how the platform works in action, do a little bit of looking around of their platform and then we'll do some Q A. So if you have questions throughout this, definitely drop them into the YouTube chat. Any links that we share, talk about, I'll make sure to drop those into the description afterwards. As always, again, drop questions in the chat. Keep it really interactive. Happy to answer those as we go through this.
00:00:55.520 - 00:01:00.320, Speaker B: Otherwise. Yeah, again, thanks a lot for joining us today. How are you?
00:01:00.690 - 00:01:09.954, Speaker A: I'm doing fine. It's a little bit of frantic with the development side. We're trying to get things pushed out. High energy. Yeah, we're doing good.
00:01:10.152 - 00:01:21.560, Speaker B: Completely understand. No, really excited to have you. Maybe for the audience that might not be aware, do you want to just give a quick introduction about your background and what your team is.
00:01:23.930 - 00:02:14.386, Speaker A: For? Unaware? My name is Krinalamin and I would be the founder of the Unidex project. And myself, I am a trader, computer science nerd. And really as we're, we started this Unidex project because we feel that trading is a little bit too fragmented within the defi ecosystem and traders really aren't seeing the tools that they need in the defi ecosystem. So essentially our project is to aggregate all services throughout any financial tool or instrument that you're willing to do, such as options trading, futures trading, leverage trading, or even token swaps. And so that's what we're providing here at Unidex.
00:02:14.578 - 00:02:25.350, Speaker B: That's awesome. So it takes a little more in depth take or approach to something like Uniswap or even other aggregators, such as like a one inch exchange.
00:02:25.510 - 00:02:32.650, Speaker A: Yeah, we aggregate even things like one inch into our. So we aggregate even aggregators.
00:02:33.250 - 00:02:36.974, Speaker B: Awesome. How did this idea start and how did you form it?
00:02:37.172 - 00:03:30.430, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think it started whenever I made my first move from centralized exchanges back in the first Uniswap season, which was about like June of last year, I saw problems whenever I was actually trying to the whole user experience you go to a centralized exchange like FTX or something, and you have really any tools that you need presented with you just right then and there. And that is one of the merits to a centralized exchange. You just have all your tools readily available because it's fairly easy to add once you have the infrastructure up. But whenever it came to defi, everything was in different places. If you wanted to do options, you had to open up another tab. If you wanted to view those option positions, you needed to open up another tab. You wanted to chart your Uniswap position or even a trade, it's another tab.
00:03:30.430 - 00:04:01.340, Speaker A: It got quite frustrating and I can see why that people weren't making them switch from their traditional centralized broker or exchange into traditional finance despite offering the same tools. It was way too fragmented and it wasn't convenient enough. And so that's why we started making this product for people. And I think people are really going to love it. It basically entirely simplifies the whole trading experience.
00:04:03.230 - 00:04:32.594, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a really interesting idea and I definitely see that problem too with things on all these different platforms. You're trying to tell friends where to start. Got a million different websites. They're all great in their own ways. How do you get someone onboarded into defi? In a simplistic way? Yeah. So really interesting. And so are you launched yet? Can people use this as we speak? Is it on main net?
00:04:32.712 - 00:04:54.540, Speaker A: Yeah, we operate on the main net. We launched about December 6 and then we went open beta into I think around like March 25. Not March 25. What am I saying? January 25. So we've been open beta and we've been collecting feedback, changing up the UI as we go out and adding features as people want to see them.
00:04:54.910 - 00:05:12.818, Speaker B: Sweet. Yeah. So it sounds like you guys are really open to feedback and everyone listening. Yeah, definitely join the channels. We'll drop those links in there and have feedback. Yeah, I think to get started. Yeah, I would love to take a peek at what you're building and how it works if you want to share your screen.
00:05:12.904 - 00:05:35.640, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Here, let me do that. So go ahead. Okay, so this is currently what we have for our assets. And you can see this, right? I'm not sure if this is viewable or not.
00:05:36.010 - 00:05:36.902, Speaker B: All good.
00:05:37.036 - 00:06:34.700, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, so this is currently what we have accessible to our public open beta. We do have a few changes that we are pushing out pretty soon here, including things like you can view all recent transactions and finance, smart chain charting and just more general on chain tools, market orders and stuff. But this is what we have for like spot trading or just swapping. In general, our more interesting products include leverage trading in which this is directly actually using Chainlink's price feeds. In this section you can basically take bowler bear positions on essentially almost anything that Chainlink supports. So for example, you can even take long and short positions on gas fees, which I think is pretty interesting.
00:06:34.700 - 00:07:30.640, Speaker A: I think it was like a week ago, gas prices shot up to 1200 way, so that would have been a fantastic short opportunity. But even non ERC 20s like for example silver, so you can even take long and short positions on things like silver or BTC to USD. And I can actually even for example go in on a bull or bear position. These are operating on the main net so that users can just right away go ahead and take a position. I don't want to probably go in on a bearish position on BTC because I am quite bullish, but as a quick demonstration I can easily just, for example, just here, let's go in 0.1.5 could just go ahead and buy into this.
00:07:33.410 - 00:07:51.780, Speaker B: Yes, it's really cool. It almost takes a spin that you see some of the other kind of synthetic assets on there. What was the process like integrating chainlink into this? Were you firsthand a part of that process and what's the development cycle kind of look like?
00:07:52.230 - 00:08:30.734, Speaker A: Well, first we look at what markets that people are interested in. First to mention, I did just open a three x short position on BTC there. And so now as the price of BTC drops, I'm now gaining profit. But anyways, back to the original topic. So first we look at what markets people want to see. We don't want to add anything that people aren't necessarily going to be trading on a regular basis. For example, we don't think that people are too interested in low volume all coins that we do have a price feed of.
00:08:30.734 - 00:09:18.160, Speaker A: But not only that, on something for our target audience, we aren't necessarily targeting novice traders. We're targeting that area of high volume, more experienced traders who want to, I guess, have a better hands on. So we look at what assets they trade and we list essentially those pairs that come with that chain link price feed. When it comes to integrating, it was actually pretty easy. I wasn't part of that myself. I was more so the one that was actually going out and doing the research and actually choosing the price feeds that we should be integrating. But the actual integration itself was fairly quick.
00:09:18.160 - 00:09:30.610, Speaker A: The ecosystem is pretty thorough, there's enough documentation and really it was a really satisfying experience, especially when seeing all the price feeds that are supported.
00:09:31.750 - 00:10:11.706, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been great working with you all too. It's just crazy, the different feeds that you see. I haven't seen a platform trading gas feed, a lot more feeds. I don't know if you heard with off chain reporting being launched on main net. And so lots more data is going to be coming online here. And for traders, what have you seen from your community of some of the stuff that people clearly looks like some of the main ones, Ethereum, BTC, have there any been kind of like out of left field things that people have been requesting like stocks and other sort of commodities?
00:10:11.898 - 00:10:50.038, Speaker A: Yeah. With the regarded stocks, at least our current target audience, we haven't really seen too much volume when it comes to stocks generally. Personally myself I would like to see a lot more. So definitely would be adding a lot more of those in the future. But when it comes to really just out of field ones, we have actually taken it ourselves to actually add some of those. So we are working with the development team to basically add for example, bitcoin dominance so that people can take long and short positions on bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin fees.
00:10:50.038 - 00:11:36.090, Speaker A: So we first took it a step further with ETH gas fees and now we're taking a step further with bitcoin transaction fees. So you can essentially hedge the efficiency of either of the two networks as people basically rant online. Which one's better on Twitter? Outside of that, we haven't necessarily seen too many weird ones. Again, volume is a concern and also just general development cycle. We don't want to focus on something that people aren't going to be interested in, but I think those would probably be the only two weird ones. Bitcoin dominance and bitcoin fees, or even ETh gas fees.
00:11:37.390 - 00:11:52.730, Speaker B: These are aggregating from the chain link price feeds. And then you were mentioning about how this aggregates from multiple aggregators. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you meant on that one?
00:11:52.900 - 00:12:47.300, Speaker A: Yeah, so specifically this section that we're using here. This section wouldn't actually entail that, but when we're talking about something like token swaps or even futures trading, the futures trading isn't actually live yet. We're still delivering that in our closed beta. But when it's something like swaps, we basically have a system that goes ahead and checks, or like an engine, if you will, that goes ahead and checks the return that you get from one inch, that you get from paraswap or you get from Zero X's AI API as of recently. And if need be directly calling uniswap Kyber balancer just to see if that can get you a more efficient fill. And then once that swap is conducted, it'll be as simple as that. You just click trade and there you go.
00:12:47.300 - 00:13:28.830, Speaker A: And when it comes to something like perpetual products that even are using chainlinks, price feeds, for example, DyDx and so forth, when you're filling along, it's same thing like the token swap process, all it does is goes ahead and checks. What's the most efficient fill here? Because there are multiple platforms that you can go ahead and enter in leverage positions so that it will go ahead and check which is the most efficient fill, taking into account funding rate, because that is something to also watch out for. And then it will give you the best efficient fill. So you're essentially never worrying about slippage or is this the right place for me to be trading?
00:13:30.210 - 00:14:02.550, Speaker B: That's really interesting. The funding fills. There's a question from the audience here and yourself as a founder of a trading platform. There's a lot of this talk that's happening in traditional markets, especially around Robin Hood, with settlement layers of the t two. So when a settlement happens, it really doesn't go through until two days. Are you seeing more influx and kind of what's your opinion on this and how decentralized markets work with instant settlements?
00:14:02.970 - 00:15:14.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I think actually myself, I actually do get frustrated with traditional finance myself sometimes. Like I mentioned before, I am a trader at heart and I do trade a wide range of markets. I think the case with traditional finance and just how long settlement takes, it really adds a lot of barriers. I understand that this is just how our finance system works, but obviously it's out with the old, in with the new. Now, the stuff that we're delivering on decentralized networks like on Ethereum to offer these synthetic products and what other people are also building as well, it really opens up the barrier when it comes to just being able to really gain exposure to these markets. And so I think a lot more people from traditional finance are going to start moving over to decentralized products. And I think that tipping point is whenever people don't even actually realize they're using a blockchain based product and they're just kind of entering a position, they're like, hey, this works.
00:15:14.874 - 00:15:16.260, Speaker A: I don't have to wait.
00:15:16.710 - 00:16:30.410, Speaker B: Yeah, there's definitely going to be a few barriers. What I want to ask you about next around L2, but the whole settlement thing, it's interesting, and a lot of people don't even know until you're using this and you hear people talk about them, hop on Robinhood and you buy and like, oh, you don't even really have this until a few days email. And then you go onto some of these decentralized platforms and you're able to instantly just be able to have a synthetic version of this or of just different crypto assets. And we see more and more of these data feeds getting popped up daily with your platform. Kind of what I was about to ask before being on Ethereum, what do you see with gas prices and the congestion that's happening? Obviously a hot topic today. Are you exploring moving to other chains? Are you exploring L2s? Are you thinking maybe this will resolve itself as things like optimism get launched? As I said, it sounds like yesterday, sometime in March? What are your kind of thoughts around all this and usability of your platform? And does that worry you at all?
00:16:30.560 - 00:16:57.490, Speaker A: Right, so I think this is a multi step answer. So for one, we are servicing traders. We want to give the best experience. So yeah, we are multi chain. So one of our few chains that we are going to support as of our first shift is going to be binance smart chain, moving away from decentralized concerns. It's where a lot of the liquidity is. So we are moving to full binance chain support.
00:16:57.490 - 00:17:47.426, Speaker A: And that would include we're recently launching option support. So we would be the first peer to peer american options on binance smart chain. Outside of that, we also see leverage protocols opening up on options, not options on binance smart chain. So we're also going to be supporting leverage trading on binance smart chain and as well as just aggregated swaps. That's our whole theme, aggregating the whole market. So we're already going to be supporting options token swaps, leverage trading with a full dashboard and basically portfolio overview on the Ethereum main net finance chain. We are going to start supporting L2 because we did see a lot of development happening there.
00:17:47.426 - 00:18:59.146, Speaker A: For example, Uniswap is experimenting with the optimism roll up and DyDx recently I forgot what solution they used, but I saw their demo and really looked into it and it's a really good experience. It basically limits all the concerns when it comes to slow inefficient blockchains and the concern with moving financial activity on chain. But I do think that the solution would resolve itself when it comes to on ETH. There are some protocols that we have in place to go ahead and alleviate some of that, such as the EIP 1559, which those aren't familiar with, should help with variance in whey price. And so I do think solutions like this are going to get widely adopted as well as L2 scaling solutions. And then, of course, EtH two. While we have been waiting for it for a while, I think that's going to end up giving a pretty satisfactory response from the whole ETH community.
00:18:59.146 - 00:19:08.220, Speaker A: And even those that have left the ETH ecosystem for these hyphes are going to be returning to see it's a pleasant experience. Now, again.
00:19:08.910 - 00:19:18.510, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good way to kind of put it. You mentioned the EIP that's coming out. So it's EIP 1559, correct?
00:19:18.580 - 00:19:19.200, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:19.810 - 00:19:32.750, Speaker B: For the audience that might not be completely aware, they might have heard it being talked about on Twitter. Do you want to just give like a quick, just le five of what that is and kind of what it's trying to solve?
00:19:32.910 - 00:20:14.738, Speaker A: Yeah. So when it comes to at least the EIP in general, basically, this is essentially a vote throughout the community, whether or not certain proposals take place. So just like you can take proposals on something like your favorite Dapp like CCSwap or uniswap, essentially, we're voting here to. There's two main components that may interest day to day users. For one, it takes some of the base fee that happens with an ethereum transaction and it burns it. So it adds somewhat of a deflationary mechanic to ethereum as we currently don't have that. So it's a bit of a monetary policy change.
00:20:14.738 - 00:21:07.970, Speaker A: And then it also reduces the variance in way prices because right now we have essentially a free market system for way. If someone wants to essentially clog the system and be paying 2000 way transactions, if we clog it enough and we spam that enough, then that's what everyone is essentially forced to use. So this would help alleviate some of the concerns with this and some of the mass swings. Whenever we see big dips or big spikes, even on eth or just on chain in general, it should help stabilize that and keep it very linear. So at a stable, like let's say 50 with a very minimal change in weight price, and so it should help alleviate those swings and inconsistencies with gas targeting.
00:21:09.110 - 00:21:52.910, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for explaining that. When you explain it, it sounds like, all right, why wasn't this always just kind of the case? You see this in different platforms where you can really spam the network. Especially there's stuff like Keeperdao where you can do this and then just create arbitrage opportunities for yourself and make a profit. So it's crazy. I guess it's like the free market principles that athletes built around. But yeah, it's really interesting. It's interesting to see the different debates that happen across crypto, Twitter and the whole community around that's happening back with decentralized oracles.
00:21:52.910 - 00:22:06.030, Speaker B: How big of a decision were these? When you're building a platform such as yourself, what's the thought process that goes into choosing an oracle?
00:22:06.190 - 00:23:54.710, Speaker A: Yeah, so whenever it came to, for example, choosing Chainlink or even using another solution, I think a good example of this we can easily just point to as a recent example is if you haven't heard about what happened with the situation at Kraken, for example, recently on our price dip that happened earlier this week, we saw a big, massive price swing that basically cleared the entire order book and it basically would have liquidated you if you were in any sort of leverage position. It didn't really matter what asset you were in. And so when it came to choosing a decentralized oracle, we had to choose something that would be reliable in the sense that it's aggregating from different multiple sources and or it's feeding the correct data that we want. And so we didn't want to go ahead and choose and aggregate from a system that uses a single source because now we're prone to manipulation, if that's the case, because anyone can then go to there and manipulate the order books that may incur in that system. For example, Kraken, if we were pulling from an oracle that was solely pulling API data from Kraken, that would have been very bad news for anyone essentially trading on our platform. So our only solution at the time, and our current solution really is Chainlink, which aggregates from multiple places and incentivized to do so. It really became a no brainer to stick with Chainlink and pulling from multiple sources, which is actually funny if you think about it, since we are an aggregator and now we're choosing an aggregator of other price feeds.
00:23:55.130 - 00:23:56.360, Speaker B: That's the answer.
00:23:57.050 - 00:23:57.646, Speaker A: Aggregation.
00:23:57.698 - 00:24:02.762, Speaker B: Use a centralized source. That's one lesson to take home.
00:24:02.896 - 00:24:42.440, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, it was essentially a no brainer, especially when you're talking about user funds and just the safety of your trade. The last thing you want to be concerned about whenever you're trading on even a centralized exchange is can a whale just come in and just wipe out this order book and then leave me liquidated with no real liquidity there? And that just becomes almost infinitely harder whenever you're trading based off a synthetic asset, off a decentralized oracle. So I think definitely it was the easiest move to go ahead and use the system like this.
00:24:43.050 - 00:25:05.726, Speaker B: Fascinating. Cool. Yeah, well, I would wrap up here if the community wants to follow your progress, get involved with adding new assets and to follow everything that you're building and working on, even to maybe get into some of those closed betas that you're working on, where's the best place for them to get into your community and follow along?
00:25:05.908 - 00:25:52.310, Speaker A: Yeah, so our current website is Unidex exchange, so users can go ahead and see our landing page there. We do have a plethora of links that people can go ahead and see, for example, our discord, our telegram, and our announcement channel there as well. Most of our communication does happen on Telegram, but a lot of our feedback and more organized criticism does come from discord. So you can give a pretty thorough answer there and we can easily review it. And as well as organized channels, for example, options, which also, by the way, uses chain link price feeds to go ahead and settle your options positions there as well. But it's stuff like that. Most of our discussion again, happens on Telegram.
00:25:52.310 - 00:26:27.878, Speaker A: So you can go ahead and talk with the community on whether or not other people do want to see something like, for example, Apple or anything like that. And if people are interested, we can even spin that up there. But yeah, our best place to reach is on our telegram chat for criticism, probably our discord chat. If you want to go ahead and try out the open beta that exists right now, you can go to Unidex beta app and go ahead and play around with the services that we're offering there right now. And yeah, that's pretty much it. Cool.
00:26:28.044 - 00:26:52.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll make sure to drop all those links into the description afterwards. Video should be up in the next few hours, make a few edits. Otherwise, yeah, I really appreciate you joining. For everyone listening in, definitely register for the upcoming Chainlink Hackathon. You can find that on our website, chain link slash Hackathon. We build awesome products with Chainlink, have tons of sponsors coming in. It'll be a great way.
00:26:52.978 - 00:27:30.280, Speaker B: If you're interested in building something on Solana, avalanche matic or Polygon. Now, any of these different platforms, definitely give it a look. Sign up. Don't really need to be a developer to be successful in a hackathon. It's a great way to learn new skills. And some of the best hackathon projects are well rounded teams. One inch came from a hackathon and so you need people that can help with the design, the front end, everything, and so definitely recommend everyone joining that if you like this video, give it a like and subscribe to our channel for when we go live in the future.
00:27:30.280 - 00:27:33.420, Speaker B: Otherwise, yeah, thanks again for joining and we'll see everyone.
