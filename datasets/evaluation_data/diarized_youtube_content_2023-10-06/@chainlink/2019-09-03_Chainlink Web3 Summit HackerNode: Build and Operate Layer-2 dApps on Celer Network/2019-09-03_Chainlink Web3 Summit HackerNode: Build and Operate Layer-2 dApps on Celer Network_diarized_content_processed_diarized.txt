00:00:08.230 - 00:01:19.150, Speaker A: So hello everyone, my name is Ching Tai and I'm the co founder of Bella Network. So I'm never happy to be here to present in our Oracle talk and Chilix is our great partners and we have been doing a lot of integration and discussions and all this kind of application. So what I'm going to talk about today is how to build and operate a L2 decentralized application on top of seller. And also how could you leverage their chain, Oracle to build some fancy application? Okay, so this is like the general agenda and I'll first give a very brief introduction about what that network is and also talk about our recent event launch. And finally I will talk about the kind of collaboration integration we did with trading Oracle and better. And finally our roadmap. So that network is a L2 scanning platform where it is built on top of every existing blockchain such as Ethereum.
00:01:19.150 - 00:02:20.734, Speaker A: The idea of L2 is doing most of the onchain transactions from onchain to off chain, while only resulting to the blockchain when there's some dispute or you need to settle some states. So on top of seller you can build various like L2 applications just run like a normal decentralized application, but it uses option scaling solution so it runs very smoothly and almost instantly. So the kind of components of cell network can be divided into two components. The first is called cstack, which is our technology stack. The second is the ceconomics, which is our crypto economics construction. So for the sake of time I will not get the details about components. If you are interested, feel free to check our website, media, white paper and along the way we have launched two testnets.
00:02:20.734 - 00:03:11.860, Speaker A: The first testnet is like last year, October, it's called Centauri and the second one is called series which is February this year. Along the way we have launched like we have built up a multi hop non custodian payment network, which is support for the Easter and ERP 20 tokens. We also for the first time provide support for the generosity channels which basically you can run options for projects. And also we also provide a demonstration with Sarax mobile applications where you can actually try out the kind of application using earlier two technologies. So I'll briefly introduce our recent mini launch which is called signals. So in the signals like mini launch we launched SSC. The first thing is our CRX user based mobile application.
00:03:11.860 - 00:04:07.074, Speaker A: The second thing is our CRX gaming SDK that is specifically designed for the gaming beverage. And the third thing is our web SDK. So in terms of the Theta X mobile applications. If you have a phone you can scan QR code and try out the app. It's basically L2 decentralized application platform for the esports game, so where players can compete and win cricket prizes on Sarah and all this kind of games hosted on Sarax is basically skill based esports games. And you can win easier die or center. And by using the L2 scanning solution, the game or the essential application running on Sarah, it has the real time interactive.
00:04:07.074 - 00:05:13.420, Speaker A: So for the first time you will be able to play real time games, crosschain games with your friend or any type of peers in this world. Also it has zero gas fees. And also due to their L2 gaming solutions, you have actually received the payment on stripe plp. And also it is also secured by the online technology blockchain where you can always dispute over your opponents or team results when you feel necessary. And we have users like over 88 countries and their VMA launch has been like over one month and currently we have over 12,000 monthly active users and there's over like 200K matches played on top of Sarax. And in total we have awarded players with over $1 million US dollar price and their day seven retention rate is about 55%. So that's even higher compared to some Internet mobile application.
00:05:13.420 - 00:06:46.890, Speaker A: And if these kind of things are running without L2 or center like the congestion is there for about five weeks and the total gas fee consumption will be around like $50,000. And these are some user feedback we got. And the next question is like can I build my own games or Sellerx? And some version might ask do I need to really understand the L2 technology? Do I need to write my own smart contract? Do I really need to handle or manage users privacy? So we have managed all these kind of things for the scenario. For the developer, all you need is two lines of code and ten minutes of integration. So that's our seller axis for streaming where if you have an HTML five game and you can do the integration with lines of code and ten minutes of integration and start to monetize your game on formatter. So if you are interested you feel free to check out developer tap and we also have the sad doc and also the developer portal for you to submit your own game. So we also have some open source demonstration where it's basically a home game where you can check out how you write a generalized day channel smart contract and how you integrate with Stellarx SDK.
00:06:46.890 - 00:07:46.474, Speaker A: And currently we have launched this kind of gamer SDK in about one month time. So currently we have around like 200 game developers and which we receive around like 14 new games. And the average first time integration time is only about 30 minutes. Okay, so finally I will talk about our failure web SDK. It is intended for developers who are more familiar with blockchain technology and has the capability to do a more in depth integration. Basically one of the important context or design pattern or Sarah aka is basically called conditional payment. Basically you can send an option payment to anywhere in this world to appear condition on the condition that some condition is set.
00:07:46.474 - 00:08:51.682, Speaker A: Like for example, I will pay you $5 if you win or if other conditions are. And on top of this kind of pattern, there are a lot of use cases such as the USB car insurance, PDP social batting prediction market and so forth. But actually one of the things I want to mention here is kind of the application that could be enabled by Stella SDK and also the chain link Oracle. Basically with Stella SDK and the chain link oracle, we can achieve off chain conditional payment with a dependency on the real world oracle. So basically there's a kind of like I can send you some offshoot payment based on some real world data. For example, whether tomorrow the Berlin will be raining or whether the temperature will be higher on certain kind of things. Yes, this is the prediction market.
00:08:51.682 - 00:10:21.794, Speaker A: So on top of that we can build like in this case like option prediction market, option derivative trading market, or some kind of paper pie or paper example, you are watching a movie every fight if you watch content provider micro payment. So this kind of streaming micro payment or the kind of paper ID will be enabled by the payment SDK and also the chili Oracle that connects the real world data to the blockchain. And we also have like two existing blockchains that integrate with stellar data and chilling. The first is called an error prediction, which is basically an option prediction market, as I mentioned earlier. The second is called the micro subscription, which is a fine grained like meter cloud hosting service with certain kind of SLA brands. So basically if the service you provide is SLA, I will like streaming or sending some micro payment to the one who hosts this cloud service. But if you experience some downtime and this kind of downtime can be detected and provided by Chilinx Oracle, basically the cloud hosting service will pay back some compensation for not achieving this kind of SRA guarantee.
00:10:21.794 - 00:11:05.142, Speaker A: So these are the two applications we have built. Actually third party developer has been building using Sarah SDK and also the chain link. So overall, the theme of our meme launch is like Facebook Earth and Builder. To monetize, we want to first launch a product that users really want to use. And also we want to help the developers to grow and also to really. Okay, so these are also some of the lessons we put on technology. Sometime I will not get details.
00:11:05.142 - 00:11:45.314, Speaker A: So the first lesson is that the DAP user experience is really the key to its method. And the second lesson is that the liquidity is a big problem for the network. But that's more down to our first page on this design. I will not get in the details. So what's next? By the end of September we will provide seller web3 times. Basically you longer need to run a local lunar before you can run any L2 technology. And then second, we will also open the echannel protocol and also open the sand network node.
00:11:45.314 - 00:12:10.260, Speaker A: By the end of that time, anyone who interested in running an option service can join standard work and participate and we'll launch the construction of our token economics by the end of this year. So that's basically my talk today. So if you have any questions, feel free to chat money.
00:12:21.430 - 00:12:25.698, Speaker B: So let's say somebody disputes Gomakuri.
00:12:25.794 - 00:13:02.466, Speaker A: Yes. What happened? You will submit the kind of state proof which both of you basically co sign during option communication and submit that to an onchain form of a smart contract. And with that cosign state proof you can basically, the smart contract can determine who wins or who number wins. And we have a conditional payment based on that resolution. So basically if the smart contract return, you win. It will basically automatically send your payment or resolve your payment to you, but.
00:13:02.488 - 00:13:16.550, Speaker B: Still states that this condition to the payment is kept in the smart contract. So basically the game is played in the on chain.
00:13:16.970 - 00:13:26.970, Speaker A: Yeah, so the game is played off chain, but when you think like, okay, my opponent is cheating only at this moment, you will submit your state proof.
00:13:27.950 - 00:13:36.278, Speaker B: Like some kind of previous state that the opponent has signed and the next state that we signed and then the transition is proposed.
00:13:36.454 - 00:14:25.402, Speaker A: Yeah, so you mentioned about the UX challenge. Are you guys using any transaction or way to have the boarding or like withdrawal or you're still like making the use of payment? I think that's a very good point. So metal construction is definitely something that we're considering. So basically because one of the pinpoint we currently have is that users will need to have both, for example, seller or die and also the ether in order to deposit into a state channel. So that's a kind of big challenge. We are kind of like a user friction when we are trying to deposit their money into the state channel. So metasuracting is one option.
00:14:25.402 - 00:14:48.740, Speaker A: And we are also talking or discussing with some onboarding service provider like a wire and they also provide kind of directly five crypto into a state channel with your buyer or debit card. Yeah, they have to do that nobody else wants to.
00:14:49.270 - 00:14:50.020, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:51.190 - 00:15:05.686, Speaker A: What do you think is like the key factors behind your attraction key? Like what made you get the number of users you have? What do you think you did right?
00:15:05.788 - 00:15:07.350, Speaker B: Are there any external factors?
00:15:07.870 - 00:15:40.050, Speaker A: Yeah, I think let's have several parts. So first of all, our product right now is not perfect. So there's still a lot of improvements like space. But I think as compared to a lot of other Jincard applications, the kind of user experience you have in our app, especially with L2, doesn't be very smooth. For example, the result are instant. You don't have to wait for the block confirmation, this kind of stuff. So that's one thing.
00:15:40.050 - 00:16:06.234, Speaker A: The other thing is more leaning towards the design of the product itself because it's a kind of place basically you can play games and win real money. So that are also kind of ways to attract real users. I think that's the kind of things that we have been trying to validate and still testing, but we have been seeing some market traction during our initial first month launch of the product.
00:16:06.432 - 00:16:11.630, Speaker B: What's the main sort of trade off? Because usually the L2 makes some kind of trade off.
00:16:11.700 - 00:16:12.030, Speaker A: Yes.
00:16:12.100 - 00:16:18.030, Speaker B: So what is the main trade off with the seller? So it's fast, but what is the price?
00:16:18.180 - 00:17:01.580, Speaker A: Yeah, so first of all, L2 technology is not some black magic. It's just like, I would say kind of like some optimistic optimization for the blockchain transaction. So if everyone is a bad guy for every transaction you just want to cheat and do not like a cooperate, then the performance of L2 will be basically fall back to the online blockchain. So that's a kind of like the assumption we have for the L2. So in terms of the trade off, there are several trade offs. For example, one thing is that you have to lock up some liquidity into your channel.
00:17:02.190 - 00:17:03.778, Speaker B: Kind of like stake at the window.
00:17:03.814 - 00:17:29.282, Speaker A: Yeah, you have to put some collateral into your smart contract. That's one thing. The other thing is that which basically we're also trying to solve and also like something like lighting network, they are also trying to solve is the connectivity of the online problem because basically you need to be present online in order to prevent some others trying to submit some old state proof to the blockchain.
00:17:29.346 - 00:17:36.406, Speaker B: So what is your liveness assumption like? How live must the seller user be.
00:17:36.508 - 00:17:42.890, Speaker A: So currently, the users have to be online when the opponent is trying to dispute over them.
00:17:42.960 - 00:17:48.466, Speaker B: But what happens if they pass the liveness period?
00:17:48.598 - 00:18:11.794, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's the reason why we have the last called SGS, which call the state guarding network. Basically, when you go offline, you can submit your state proof to some like side chain. And this side chain will help you to guard your state. Basically, when you help you to submit or dispute your state, when you are good offline, but you have two piece of money.
00:18:11.832 - 00:18:25.110, Speaker B: I'm interested, like, how catastrophic is it if a bad state goes through? If nobody disputes it in time, then is there like a rollback option or is it final? Or can it be recovered somehow?
00:18:26.910 - 00:18:30.380, Speaker A: Or will it ever be accepted if it's wrong?
00:18:31.070 - 00:18:37.900, Speaker B: Will it ever be kind of accepted if it's wrong? Of course the conditional payment will happen and that cannot be undone, right?
00:18:38.530 - 00:18:59.140, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's the worst that can happen, right? Yeah. I think the principle is like, as long as the blockchain or the auction smart contract accepts the kind of the state proof you submit, you cannot revert that. So the state guardian network just helps you to guard your state when you approve of.
00:19:00.230 - 00:19:10.854, Speaker B: Have you got any kind of plan B? If a bad state gets accepted, then is it like immediate exit for everyone or is there some kind of plan B?
00:19:10.972 - 00:19:15.990, Speaker A: Okay, currently there's no plan B to revert.
00:19:16.810 - 00:19:18.760, Speaker B: Layer two doesn't have a plan B.
00:19:19.310 - 00:19:43.360, Speaker A: Yeah, but we will basically punish or flash the kind of states that those kind of state gardens put into their smart contract. So that's a kind of like crypto economics design to help you ensure that they will not submit some bad proof. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Yes, thank.
