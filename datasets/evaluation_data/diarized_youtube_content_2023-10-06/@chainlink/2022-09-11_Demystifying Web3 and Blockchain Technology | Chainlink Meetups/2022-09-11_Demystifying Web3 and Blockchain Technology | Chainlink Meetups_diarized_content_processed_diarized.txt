00:00:48.610 - 00:01:27.382, Speaker A: Really excited to be here to. It's the first chain link panel event that we've done in Houston, Texas. We've done a lot of stuff in Austin. This is very, very exciting for me to be here and to welcome, I think, one of the most inspiring panels we've had in a while. So before I hand to them, I do want to make sure that everyone is aware that we are filming today's event. So, if you'll notice, I did do my hair, especially for the cameras. But, no, I wanted to remind people that actually, on the 20 eigth and 9 September, Chainlink is hosting our annual Smartcon conference, which is an industry leading event in the crypto space for people working, networking, or trying to develop in the crypto and smart contract space.
00:01:27.382 - 00:01:44.878, Speaker A: So I highly recommend that you look at some of the material here today. You look online and think about coming along. It is in the heart of New York City. And again, I said at the end of end of September, the 20 eigth and 29th. So my name is Ben. I'm going to be your host for tonight and part of the advocate problem for Chainlink. And I'm going to let each panelist now introduce themselves.
00:01:44.878 - 00:01:46.640, Speaker A: So, starting here.
00:01:47.010 - 00:02:05.410, Speaker B: Great. My name is Max Melcher. I'm a go to market lead for a solution at Chainlink called Proof of Reserve. And what we do is we verify the reserve backing a lot of tokenized assets. So, like real world assets, like stablecoins, wrapped assets like WBTC, and also tokenized.
00:02:06.390 - 00:02:27.740, Speaker C: Yeah. Hi, my name is Jimmy sue. I'm the co founder of Pocket Worlds. We make high rise and ever Skype, which are two virtual worlds, also known as metaverses. I think we're one of the OGs in this space. We started in 2013, and high rise now has, I think, north of 20 million users. And Eversky's is a top ten app in the App Store.
00:02:29.150 - 00:02:45.140, Speaker D: Hey, Greg Wong. And I'm the CEO of teller finance. We're essentially the openc for lending markets. We allow anyone to be able to launch their own lending markets within a few minutes, and they can source liquidity through that.
00:02:46.390 - 00:02:56.690, Speaker E: Howdy. I'm Evan van Nass. I have a newsletter called Week in Ethereum news, and I run a little venture fund called Starbloom Ventures.
00:02:57.830 - 00:02:59.054, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:02:59.192 - 00:03:00.246, Speaker C: Well, welcome.
00:03:00.428 - 00:03:02.678, Speaker A: I think I'll start with an easy one for you.
00:03:02.764 - 00:03:03.110, Speaker C: Okay.
00:03:03.180 - 00:03:24.800, Speaker A: And we'll come back the other way. We'll start with Evan. So right now, we see the market's down, all the excitement, all of the hype is gone. So what do you think is some of the key web three benefits? Now that all of the excitement and the noise is gone, what are some of the core functionality that you can still see shining through in today's market?
00:03:26.450 - 00:04:42.278, Speaker E: Yeah, well, so I was just in Argentina and I have a lot of ties to Argentina. If you want to talk about a place that has web three adoption, it is there. Of course, sometimes it's on centralized apps, so a lot of people own Dai, but they own it on a centralized app. And honestly, the reason why they own it is because it's a way to get around capital controls. But I think it's pretty cipherpunk of them to get around the corrupt, unjust government. So, yeah, I'm still pretty bullish on people that, well, the Argentines have more faith and religious faith in the US dollar than Americans do, but I'm super bullish on just that as a use case and people doing that, I'm perpetually going to be excited by that because real people, like middle class, working class family members of mine, use it and are excited about it. And the challenge of moving them to hosting their own keys and to actually using actual defi apps is still there, but it's happening.
00:04:42.278 - 00:05:12.762, Speaker E: And a little fun fact I saw is that there are more. It's not even close. There are more people that own crypto in Argentina than own equities in Argentina. So crypto is much more seen as something that you would invest in than stocks. I don't know. I think Gary Gensler maybe should learn from that, since he was telling us to put our money in a bank account when it was earning 0.1% while inflation was 8%.
00:05:12.762 - 00:05:16.660, Speaker E: But yeah, I'll stop there. I'm excited about that.
00:05:17.110 - 00:05:18.100, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:05:19.110 - 00:06:02.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's ownership and community. I think that everyone's heard the phrase in this room of not your keys, not your coins. And I think that has great. It resonates deeply with the ethos of this community, which is making sure that everyone has skin in the game. There is a different buy in, and as a result, you have these communities form and everyone in this room. You feel the energy when you go to crypto conferences, especially like in the bull market, the beer market, now you have it where people are dedicated to this space and they want to build, they want to participate.
00:06:04.530 - 00:06:38.060, Speaker C: I think for us, the value proposition is pretty obvious. When we started in 2013, our core business model revolved around digital assets, and digital assets having value and web three really is a multiplier on top of that so for us inside of our world so far as a web two company, we already have these clothes, furniture, environments, pets that people buy and sell and trade for thousands of dollars. And then now moving to web three, it's just more liquidity and more composability for the things that you're already on.
00:06:39.390 - 00:07:16.774, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with Evan, actually the accessibility I think globally is huge. I think the last cycle brought a lot more of that. But I also think awareness today, even the United States, I think that has increased know even if it is on a centralized exchange, people are getting more exposure to crypto and I think that exposure is good. It introduces them to the concepts people. Even my parents who are here today, they're 60 and they have purchased crypto and I think this last wave brought in a lot of new people in both old and young. And I think that's all positive for the space.
00:07:16.892 - 00:07:20.090, Speaker E: Doxed. Just kidding.
00:07:20.430 - 00:07:25.660, Speaker A: Did you talk your parents into buying crypto? Did you twist their arm a little bit or is that.
00:07:27.470 - 00:07:34.798, Speaker B: We talked about central banking, we talked about inflation. I think if you start to connect the dots they may have found some interest themselves.
00:07:34.964 - 00:07:45.426, Speaker A: I like that. Out of interest. It's down. Hello, are these parents? No. Where are the parents are here the back. Oh, hello. Sorry, I assume you're wrong.
00:07:45.426 - 00:08:00.920, Speaker A: Welcome. So you mentioned accessibility. I think a lot of criticism gets thrown at web three dapps for example, on user experience. What do you think are key areas that have improved in the last twelve months?
00:08:02.330 - 00:08:48.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's funny, I think it's a good question because a lot of times people are saying hey, this is what needs to be done to onboard the next wave. And we don't often look back and say hey, here's we did a really good job of last year and personally I remember last year I'd Google questions I had and it would be maybe I'm curious about how synthetics works. And the top ten videos were all price predictions 2025 and it wasn't helpful. And I think one of the things we've really seen growth in the space is the developer relations and documentation. There are great YouTube influencers like Patrick Collins who've gone above and beyond to create resources for developers that are going through boot camps to learn how to program in solidity and get onboarded. So I think developer relations and onboarding developers has really improved over the last year and it's worth noting.
00:08:50.250 - 00:09:32.338, Speaker C: So I think for us one of the fundamental things that we've always focused on is accessibility. And our philosophy is since we were in the business of metaverses and VR is obviously a big thing. We could make a VR experience, but we chose to go instead to mobile in the beginning because we thought mobile was more accessible. There's a lot more people on mobile and VR. I think even today the adoption is not quite there. I think over the last year what I've seen is that web three in the crypto community has really adopted that philosophy as well. I think people have started to really realize that in order to fully go mainstream, to really reach the world, you have to think beyond what really people in this room is comfortable with.
00:09:32.338 - 00:09:46.120, Speaker C: How do you create a product? How do you create a wallet, even that someone can pick up and not even have to know what an address is, what a blockchain is, they can just use it. I think we've made a lot of progress in the last twelve months.
00:09:46.810 - 00:10:42.374, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually agree a lot with that accessibility. And I like to take the example of NFTs. I think we even have a pudgy penguin shirt over here and we look back at last year. It's the accessibility with allowing the attention to be grabbed from the mainstream through cultural relevance. You have it where there are huge barriers to entry prior to all that, where you're looking at these Defi apps and saying, hey, you have to do over collateralization, you have to do with Defi Summer, all this yield farming. And this is complicated stuff, especially for people who don't even know how to use a metamask wallet. And so you have the surge of NFTs which allowed people to come in and say, hey, let me get a piece of this and let me just get my feet wet.
00:10:42.374 - 00:10:46.170, Speaker D: And if I'm continuing to be interested in crypto, let me dive deeper.
00:10:48.030 - 00:11:43.118, Speaker E: Well, it would be boring if I agreed, right? So I'll disagree. Yeah, I actually don't really feel like it's improved that much in the last twelve months. My feeling about how crypto gets adopted is that people, for better and for worse, get involved in this space often because they think they can get rich quick, and often then they stick around because maybe they learn some self sovereignty values, whatever it is that gets them to stick around. Me personally, when I think about key management, I still feel like it's a little bit unsolved. There's multi sigs that are better mostly just because they've been around, so they've been a little bit more hardened. Ledger sucks, right? Sorry. But like hardware wallets, they're still really bad.
00:11:43.118 - 00:12:39.440, Speaker E: My friends at grid plus the Latice one is like a cool hardware wallet that is way better than ledger, but their hardware wallet is out of stock because they can't produce enough to keep up with the demand and it's like $350 or something. So I don't know. I think they've improved on key management, but outside of that, I don't know. These things take time just because these are technological solutions that need some time to be hardened before I would tell my argentine family to put their entire crypto net worth into one of these things. I don't know. Whenever people tell me they get into the space, I feel nervous because if the money is meaningful to them, I feel like I need to have to steer them into better key management. And it's nontrivial, shall we say.
00:12:40.450 - 00:13:02.360, Speaker A: Is there any functionality coming that you think is going to be key? If nothing's improved drastically in the last twelve months? What is that one piece you're looking to be launched? What, dare I say, Ethereum 2.0? Or is that, in your opinion, maybe not as groundbreaking as the market is hyping it up to be?
00:13:05.050 - 00:13:07.606, Speaker E: Wait, sorry, was this about roadmap or.
00:13:07.628 - 00:13:13.450, Speaker A: About just in general, what do you think is a key piece of functionality that is coming that you're excited to see in the space?
00:13:13.600 - 00:13:43.170, Speaker E: Got it. Yeah. Well, of course the merge is happening in three weeks, which I think is a seminal moment for crypto. I think it is as important as the chain launch of bitcoin or Ethereum. It's the moment when we reduce the energy footprint of blockchain forever by a factor of. Hold on, let me do some math in my head. 10,000, 1000.
00:13:43.170 - 00:13:44.050, Speaker E: I forget.
00:13:44.390 - 00:13:48.166, Speaker A: For those that don't know, can you briefly touch on what the merge is?
00:13:48.348 - 00:14:38.520, Speaker E: Yeah, so there's this chain, this proof of stake chain that went live in December 2020 that has been running in production for. Since then, so almost two years. And it is a proof of stake chain that is currently not really being used for anything except for coming to consensus about the state of itself. So Ethereum currently has two chains. There's the main net proof of work chain that we all know and occasionally love when gas fees aren't really expensive. So we are going to basically swap out the proof of work part and then use the proof of stake chain to come to consensus on all the transactions happening on the proof of work chain. So they will basically be merged, hence the name.
00:14:38.520 - 00:15:25.310, Speaker E: Danny Ryan picked the name. I'm still a little salty about that because I tried to make it become turning off proof of work instead of the merge, but he won, so it's called the merge. I don't know, it still hurts me a little bit to say it honestly. Yeah, I'm excited about that. I mean I think that's like a huge thing, but that's so close like three weeks away that I'm personally more excited about roll ups really becoming a thing. Basically we have no good, decentralized, really cheap platform right now and I think roll ups are going to be that. And then in the next fork after the merge we're going to cut the price of transactions on these roll ups.
00:15:25.310 - 00:16:04.480, Speaker E: So right now gas fees are relatively cheap. It costs let's say thirty cents to do a transaction on a roll up and we should be cutting that down to under a cent at current gas prices, which probably won't stay this low. But still, transactions under a cent, that should keep Vitalik's famous maxim of the Internet of money can't cost five cents a transaction. So I think we're actually going to get there in, I don't know, six to nine months. Predicting the future is pretty hard, but let's say six to nine months.
00:16:06.210 - 00:16:53.346, Speaker C: Just to kind of respond to that original point that you were making about I guess the accessibility not really improving the last twelve months. I think from an application developer perspective our end goal is to create a system where a user can come in, interact with web three and blockchain and not even know that they're touching it. And I think to that end with fireblocks, magic wallet, Web three Auth, these are all kind of third party wallet solutions that have spun up maybe not so fireblocks that sprung up over the last twelve months that make that a possibility, where the experience can function somewhat like Google sign in, where with email and password a user can have access to all of web three and have no idea that they're touching any of it. And I think that is a pretty, from our perspective, from an application developer perspective it's pretty big breakthrough in terms.
00:16:53.368 - 00:16:58.020, Speaker D: Of accessibility, I'd say I'm pretty hyped for that.
00:16:59.830 - 00:17:11.510, Speaker A: What do you think is the main route into, for someone that's completely new to it route into web three? Do you think it's centralized exchanges and that's where the main work to improve adoption is, or is it nfts?
00:17:14.810 - 00:18:34.462, Speaker C: So for me I think as a concrete example for high rise, our core audience is 17 to 24 year old female and this is an audience that has, that is not really tech savvy. They have no idea what blockchain is and for them all they care about is having that really cool pet in that virtual world that nobody else has, that has value because everyone is, it's very coveted and they want to keep it and they want to feel like it's theirs and it's unique. And I think that is a great entry point because with web three we can now move that essentially that guarantee that this pet is unique from our database into really a public ledger that make it a lot more substantial. And I think that promise that this thing now has a lot more value that you actually own and you can actually take it to a marketplace and show it off or another app and it's composable and all of that. I think that has a lot of value. I think that has value more so than I am buying this token to invest because I want to make money. I think at the end of the day that's probably still going to be a pretty small portion of people, whereas the people that actually use the Internet that can benefit from digital assets ownership is going to be much bigger than that.
00:18:34.462 - 00:18:35.920, Speaker C: Investor community.
00:18:37.970 - 00:19:12.970, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I agree with you. In your example, the demographic, the interest, I think people are going to get into web three because of an interest they have. So the demographic you just described may not be interested in going on AAve and taking out a loan, right? They may not be interested in participating in Defi. But maybe you're into gaming and maybe when you unlock a loot box, you want to know that you had an equal chance of getting a certain drop. So you get into NFTs because of gaming. Maybe you are interested in trading derivatives and that's your gateway into using synthetics or derivative platform on the blockchain. So I think everybody's entry point is going to be different.
00:19:12.970 - 00:19:22.800, Speaker B: And I think getting people interested in what they're inherently interested in and giving them the web three path is probably the best way to keep people actually interested in using the platform.
00:19:24.130 - 00:20:06.160, Speaker A: I like it. I want to touch briefly on anonymous teams, but before I do that, if I show of hands, who has a wallet, crypto wallet in the room? Okay, everyone, no surprise. What about NFT? Does anyone not have or own an NFT currently? Okay, about half. Interesting. I think a big part of NFT, considering NFTs for people that are new to the space, is having a completely anonymous team or a team you can look up. Do you think that's going to change over the next twelve months? And how do you as someone who's developing in this space, get comfortable working with an anonymously run protocol where you can't find the person. At the end of the day.
00:20:08.130 - 00:20:47.126, Speaker B: I don't think identity should be a proxy for trust. So just because you know who the team is, I think last several months have shown us that people can still be left without certain repercussions for their action. So just knowing who the project is doesn't guarantee anything. And I think especially time way to point out right now, I probably didn't have a strong opinion in the past. I've worked with docs, teams and anonymous, but there was a developer who recently was reprimanded for writing open source software in Europe and I think he may be still in custody. So I think my opinion on this may change. It's just my own opinion.
00:20:47.126 - 00:20:56.510, Speaker B: And I think the other developers will look at that and make decisions about publicizing their identity because of what happened. And that's a consequence.
00:20:59.410 - 00:21:19.000, Speaker C: I think coming from kind of the more traditional web two world, I'm more of a pragmatist rather than an idealist. I think pragmatically speaking, it is, to your point, trust. Having that non anonymous team, it just inherently has more trust to me.
00:21:20.250 - 00:21:38.170, Speaker D: Yeah, I think as the space got started, we look back at Satoshi and publicly no one knows who he is still. And I think it was important to support the ethos of the space in the beginning. But as we've started to mature.
00:21:39.870 - 00:21:40.438, Speaker B: The.
00:21:40.544 - 00:22:16.470, Speaker D: Ability to know who that team is, to have that team docs is even more important. It goes back to what they've been saying, it's reputation and being able to. Although someone might carry a pseudo anonymous handle name, if that person has a huge reputation, I'd say maybe there's grounds to have someone who is anon, but really I would support that. We have people who are docs because reputation is everything and it keeps people accountable.
00:22:19.710 - 00:23:02.520, Speaker E: Yeah, there are a lot of people with bunny profile pictures on the web who I trust a lot more than Doe Kwan. Identity is a spectrum. There's people that they go to conferences, they just don't use know. I think Vitalik said lately, like people should stop calling it their real name. You should start calling it your legal name. They show up at conferences, but they use their pseudonym or, I don't know, some people even wear a mask. I saw recently at a conference that was a little interesting.
00:23:02.520 - 00:23:34.258, Speaker E: But yeah, I mean it is a little bit of a spectrum there more than perhaps is seen at first blush. You can obviously build up a lot of reputation as a pseudonym. There's somebody who's done that. I've known for 15 years, who I have a lot of respect for. That's Hazu, works for paradigm now. So I assume that paradigm knows what his legal name is. But yeah, I don't know.
00:23:34.258 - 00:24:06.138, Speaker E: The early days of the space. Back in 2014, I was convinced that most Ethereum app developers would be anonymous and they would publish their code on GitHub, and that was it. And until recently that seemed sort of paranoid. But then we have the amateur hour of OFAC censoring tornado cache. They have clearly no idea what they're doing. Some bureaucrat told them what to do and they did it. It's obviously unconstitutional and will be struck down.
00:24:06.138 - 00:24:20.670, Speaker E: But in the meantime, we've seen that government is not always very intelligent about their rulemaking, and I think it will cause people to consider how they develop code on the Internet.
00:24:23.590 - 00:24:51.900, Speaker A: As metaverse technology gets more developed and it's possible to have some of these conferences completely, virtually as your NFT, can you see a time where people spend more time as their chosen NFT name character web three personality than they do their legal personality? Or do you think it's always going to be majority legal name and then dipping in and out of the web three space?
00:24:52.750 - 00:25:21.300, Speaker D: I actually think we're going to have a mix. I mean, we can even look at influencers who came up in the recent years like G Money, and he has a huge following. If you attend an event, you know what G money looks like and you will know his name. But over virtually, if you've never met him, you're just going to see an ape overlaid on his face.
00:25:23.990 - 00:25:25.250, Speaker A: Evan O Max.
00:25:25.670 - 00:25:54.480, Speaker E: Yeah. The early days of the Internet, a lot of it was finding weird ways to have community. One of them in the early 90s, after, well, sort of same time as bulletin boards, but was email lists. There was this whistleblower from Twitter, he goes by Mudge. I saw a picture today of him testifying before Congress like 20 some years ago. I think it was like the mid ninety s. And all of them were using their hacker name.
00:25:54.480 - 00:26:03.742, Speaker E: They were testifying in the Senate House or the Senate, I don't know. But they all had like Mudge kingpin, like whatever the other guy's name was.
00:26:03.796 - 00:26:04.834, Speaker A: Black cards in front of them.
00:26:04.872 - 00:26:31.866, Speaker E: Yeah. And it really made me laugh. So I don't know, I think there's, on the Internet, nobody knows that you're a dog or whatever. People like to explore different personalities and I think that's probably going to be increasingly more of a thing. Who knows? I mean, second life, it was a big thing to pretend to be somebody completely different than you were. But then second life died, too. So I don't know.
00:26:32.048 - 00:26:56.042, Speaker C: So I think this whole thing is kind of a pendulum. Like you said, when the Internet first started, it was very anonymous. And then we got to the point of Web 2.0, which is when Facebook came in and gave identity to the Internet and people felt safe. I think before Web 2.0, I don't know if folks remember, but you would never put your credit card on your computer online. The automatic exhaustion was people just steal your information.
00:26:56.042 - 00:27:27.318, Speaker C: But then Facebook came in, Amazon came in, and now everyone's identity, their physical identity, is tied to their online identity. And now Web is something that anyone can use. And I think from there, really, from early days of Internet to Web 2.0, was the pendulum swing all the way to one direction. And then in the last, I would say, probably five years, people have gotten really tired of being the real identities online. It's very constricting. And then that's when really Bitmoji Snapchat started kicking off this thing where you don't have to use your profile picture as your online identity.
00:27:27.318 - 00:27:42.320, Speaker C: So then that was really the tip of the spear. Swing the pendulum backwards. So now I think with Web three, we're in this phase of the pendulum back into this anonymous stage, whereas I think in 510 years from now, it'll swing back into that real identity direction again.
00:27:43.330 - 00:27:50.674, Speaker A: Do you think people will start working, having contracts, employment completely under a pseudonym? Because that's possible now, right?
00:27:50.872 - 00:27:58.950, Speaker C: It's possible. But again, I think as we evolve, it's going to teeter back and forth. I don't think we're going to go all the way to anonymous.
00:28:01.290 - 00:28:22.320, Speaker E: I mean, you could say that there are plenty of people in web three right now that are working for dows that are completely, they get paid USDC or die on chain, and nobody knows what their identity is. So, I mean, it's already possible for sure. And I think often it's because they're from some country that they need the anonymity, but it's a thing.
00:28:25.250 - 00:28:47.358, Speaker A: So stepping away from the anonymous side of things question I like to ask, I think, is a really good measure of how long you've been in the space. What's one thing you wish you could have told yourself when you were starting out to do differently between when you first started in web three and then now start with Max?
00:28:47.534 - 00:29:13.726, Speaker B: That's a good question. I think if I look at my view when I entered the space, there's a popular meme on the Internet it's like it's happening tonight. I think my view was that a lot of development was going to come very quickly and adoption would be tomorrow. And I think Evan said very early, it's a marathon, not a sprint. And a lot of these things, we're still improving. We're not all the way there yet. With, I think that mindset going in.
00:29:13.726 - 00:29:27.858, Speaker B: I operated on a sprint mode, trying to work as many hours a day as possible, and I think just resetting and realizing that it's going to be a slow path forward and upwards, but.
00:29:27.944 - 00:29:59.420, Speaker C: Worthwhile, in my opinion, I think, for me. So we started looking into web three around 2018. I think that was the Ico craze, and I think if I were to tell myself back then, it would be. It's not quite ready. I think it's not quite. The technology is great, I think the promise is amazing, but it's not quite ready for what we do, which is more mainstream adoption. But the other thing is, I would tell myself, is that the space moves incredibly, incredibly fast.
00:29:59.420 - 00:30:08.910, Speaker C: That, who knows? In six months from now, right now we're in middle of 2022, 2023, it might be ready. Don't know. I think right now we're just on the cusp.
00:30:10.130 - 00:30:32.630, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd say work on your foundation. With the space moving super fast, there is a lot of noise, and being able to distill that down to what the actual signal is is extremely important. You're going to be able to see what matters and being able to keep the focus on the target and also listen to the users.
00:30:36.040 - 00:31:21.796, Speaker E: Yeah. The first thing I would tell myself is that proof of work is going to be around for a long time, and I would be pretty disheartened by that, I think. But, hey, we're three weeks away from turning it off, so we got that going for us. The other thing I would tell myself, which maybe doesn't interest anyone else, is the scams are going to be even worse than happened in the original.com revolution, and that's just part of it. And you sort of have to take the good with the bad, and you don't have to get so bothered by how many scammers are pulling out so much money. But, yeah, I don't know.
00:31:21.796 - 00:31:23.350, Speaker E: I'm still pretty bothered by it.
00:31:24.680 - 00:31:35.960, Speaker A: Scammers is definitely a big challenge for the space. What do you see, personally, for you and your team as the biggest challenge you have to overcome in the next year or two? Go back out of the way, Evan.
00:31:39.580 - 00:31:54.700, Speaker E: Yeah, I probably don't have a good answer for this because I run a venture fund, so I have to find game changing investments that revolutionize the space or I fail. So no pressure.
00:31:57.040 - 00:32:21.210, Speaker D: For us, it's a teller. It's really just listening to the users. We're in this phase right now where we built out the protocol. We have this infrastructure and we're having people come in and launch a ton of markets off of us, but it's really keeping our ear close to the user and saying, well, what do you really need to continue reducing this friction in the UX and being able to bring in actual feature sets that matter?
00:32:23.500 - 00:32:52.690, Speaker C: I think our next big challenge is figuring out how do we onboard 20 million people onto web three. So far we've done it with 10,000. We kind of dabbled our toes into, dipped our toes into NFTs, but that was very much a small project. And now we've got this massive horde of high rise users and ever skies users that don't really know how to navigate. So how do we build the right experience, the right ux, so then they don't have to learn?
00:32:54.500 - 00:33:29.420, Speaker B: I think people are very worried about the current thing. And so when there's scams and Defi protocols that are operating in manners, which should be very clear that they're scams, it's the top of mind and infrastructure and protection against that is on everyone's mind. But time passes and people forget or seem to go back to these protocols or use certain tokens that maybe don't have certain protections. And I think reinforcing the lessons we've learned the hard way and keeping that top of mind and really building off of that is crucial to establish and keep going.
00:33:29.570 - 00:33:55.830, Speaker A: Nice. So before I turn over to the audience for some questions, I have a final request, if you will. What is the biggest prediction you have for the space coming year? Whether that be from a legislation point of view or from functionality, or whether it be the market turning back, what is something really bold? If you're like, you know, what if I'm just going to say, best case scenario, worst case scenario, what's the boldest prediction you want to put out there?
00:33:56.520 - 00:34:28.130, Speaker B: I don't know if it's a bold prediction. Jimmy will like it. It's a bit of a leading indicator as a lot of VC money is going into blockchain gaming right now. I think there's a lot of utility for defi tools for people in countries like Argentina, but I think in the United States, one of the big value propositions can be gaming moving into the future. So I think gaming is going be to large. I think maybe gambling potentially right now, a lot of these online services operate in a black box. And I think gaming, my bold prediction is next year that's really going to be large.
00:34:30.180 - 00:35:10.124, Speaker C: So my prediction is a little bit longer term. I think blockchain and web three, I think is really just a collection of private money issued in different tokens, different currencies. But there's one big public money that we all use, which is USD, the US dollar. And I think it's inevitable for the US government to move into digital currencies with CBDC central bank digital currency. China is already testing theirs. And I think ultimately when that happens, that will be the Internet moment where everybody can just use this without worrying about all these different networks and technologies. We'll have one thing.
00:35:10.124 - 00:35:27.860, Speaker C: If you think of the US central bank CBDC as the main highway, that's the Internet backbone. All the private money networks, the current blockchains that we use will be kind of the side roads that you can also use. But the main thing, the traffic is going to be on that CBDC network.
00:35:29.000 - 00:36:05.810, Speaker D: Yeah, I think if with that bold claim, Jimmy, I'd like to be able to see that happen, because with that, Defi would explode and it'd be good for teller explode in a good way. In a great way. In a great way. I think there will be a huge amount of users coming into the space, there's a huge amount of user adoption. And I think that over this next year, specifically within DeFi, we're going to see additional institutions come in, additional fintechs come in and really try to figure out how do they utilize web three.
00:36:09.060 - 00:36:40.088, Speaker E: Yeah, so this will be like the fourth answer where I talk about the merge. I think in the next three weeks, when we turn off proof of work, we will see that proof of work is obsolete and it will quickly become obvious because flows determine the value of things in the space and the flows are going to fundamentally change. And so in the next twelve months, I think we'll see the flippening. How is that?
00:36:40.174 - 00:37:02.480, Speaker A: Do you have any concerns about the merge and it's switching the proof of stake? One concern that was raised on a previous panel was that the vast majority of theorem tokens are held at centralized exchanges who technically have to report to some kind of government. So they would have the majority of the stake for proof of stake. Do you think that's a genuine concern?
00:37:04.020 - 00:38:05.984, Speaker E: No, I mean, the fundamental properties of proof of stake are much better in terms of security. And one reason is if you look at hash power. I think 25% of hash power on bitcoin right now is american public companies given selfish mining attacks. Basically, we're already near to the point where the US government could decide to tell bitcoin what to do through miners. The difference you can go back to Andreas Antonopoulos published a video years ago that basically said the reason why people won't 51% attack is because if they do that in proof of work, then we'll just change the mining algorithm. And that's useful, but it's difficult. The difference is that in Ethereum, we can literally just take their mining farms and burn them down without any actual incendiary things by just slashing their stake.
00:38:05.984 - 00:39:03.868, Speaker E: So if people decide that, if governments or governments or centralized exchanges decide that they want to try to censor, I think they will quickly realize that it's not in their best interest, because Coinbase, if they decide they want to censor, they will lose their. They'll get slashed. So given that they have a duty both to their clients and to their shareholders, I think that their choice will be to exit the staking business or to get slashed. I think it's pretty obvious which one they're going to pick. Brian Armstrong even tweeted out, know, if this was the know, they, Coinbase would have to exit the staking business. So, yeah, I'm not particularly worried about that. And by the way, Brian Armstrong went to rice.
00:39:03.868 - 00:39:06.330, Speaker E: So there's the Houston connection right there.
00:39:07.260 - 00:39:10.296, Speaker B: I want to say, evan, you said the flipping. I'm not sure everybody knows what that is.
00:39:10.318 - 00:39:11.684, Speaker C: Do you want to define that?
00:39:11.822 - 00:39:18.220, Speaker E: That is ethereum dethroning bitcoin forever on the top of the market cap charts.
00:39:20.240 - 00:39:22.430, Speaker A: How likely do you think that is?
00:39:24.580 - 00:39:51.196, Speaker E: Well, you told me to make a prediction, so I made a prediction. Yeah. In the next year. Predicting the future is hard. So one thing about proof of work is that you need a large amount of money coming in to the space every single day in order to keep the price the same. Right. So I haven't done the math on it recently.
00:39:51.196 - 00:40:14.576, Speaker E: Obviously, it changes with what the price of bitcoin or ETH is on any given day. But last I checked, it was something like $20 million for both bitcoin and Ethereum. So you needed $20 million of currency coming in every day in order to keep the price just the same. Basically, it's going to be the opposite. After proof of work.
00:40:14.678 - 00:40:14.992, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:40:15.046 - 00:41:11.360, Speaker E: After the merge and we turn off proof of work because. Sorry. I'm figuring out how many layers of abstraction I should mention here, but basically because proof of stake has much, much lower issuance, it will be the opposite, which is that Ethereum can withstand something like a few million dollars worth of ETH being sold every day and still the price will stay the same. So fundamentally, I think even if you ignore the value of memes and narratives and all that, and institutions buying ETH, because now it's like an environmentally friendly thing, whereas obviously proof of work is not just fundamentally, the flows are going to be so powerful over the long run that I think the flippinning is inevitable.
00:41:12.260 - 00:41:31.750, Speaker A: Excellent answer. Thanks. So I'm going to open up to the floor. We have a microphone at the back. Does anyone want to ask the first question of the panelists? Yeah, we've got to come down the front here. Yeah, my name is Charles.
00:41:31.830 - 00:41:34.794, Speaker B: Anyways, my first question, or my only.
00:41:34.832 - 00:41:36.314, Speaker E: Question I had really is does the.
00:41:36.352 - 00:41:41.210, Speaker B: CBDC central bank, okay, digital currency.
00:41:43.070 - 00:41:43.386, Speaker E: Is.
00:41:43.408 - 00:41:49.040, Speaker B: That at ODs with the sovereignty component that we were discussing about web three?
00:41:50.290 - 00:42:43.870, Speaker C: The short answer is yes. I think that even bringing up CBDC in the presence of a lot of web three blockchain folks is pretty controversial because what CBDCs typically do, obviously there's a lot of advantages, but the disadvantage is you lose the privacy component because it's no longer decentralized, it is fundamentally centralized and it's controlled by one entity, and that entity is US government. So you have to, I guess, have faith in that. But I guess at the end of the day, the question is, are you a pragmatist, in which case you're advocating for the technology, or are you more of an idealist and you're trying to champion whatever political thing, whether it's about freedom or decentralization.
00:42:46.230 - 00:43:13.066, Speaker E: So I have a differing view. So I was in Switzerland to speak at a Bank of international settlements conference. I don't know, in March maybe. I had to dress up. It was like the only time I've worn pants for a while. So I talked to a bunch of central bankers. The bis gets it.
00:43:13.066 - 00:43:40.530, Speaker E: So when we talk about CBDC, the first challenge is define what we. You know, central banks already have digital currency, right? Like that's a thing. It exists. So if you're the Fed or whoever it is, you can issue money is easy. They create it every day digitally. Now if they want to do it on a blockchain, then they have to decide what they're going to do. So what are they going to do? Create their own chain? Well, that's.
00:43:40.530 - 00:44:39.822, Speaker E: The Fed already exists. There already are these systems. So the question is what are they going to issue it on? I don't think it's going to be easy for them because when the Fed came out with a report on CBDCs a while back, and of course they said things like, we want it to be private, but we also want it to be transparent. Okay, yeah, well, I'd also like to have my cake and eat it too, as government reports tend to do. I mean, they come out with a wish list of things that are diametrically opposed. So if they are going to do these things eventually, there is only, in my view, really one credibly neutral system in the world, and that's Ethereum and maybe bitcoin, but no government's ever going to do anything on bitcoin. One, because it's almost impossible.
00:44:39.822 - 00:45:17.858, Speaker E: Two, because proof of work and energy waste. So I think in the end, I think we will see central bankers issuing tokens on Ethereum. We're really not that far off. I've talked to them. They have plans for things in the future. I don't know if I'm supposed to say that. Yeah, there are certainly proof of concepts and things that they're going to try it out and see if it works on a small scale and see what the prevailing political wins happen.
00:45:17.858 - 00:46:06.654, Speaker E: And I don't know, there are reasons why certain nation states would want to do it more than others. And so I think that you will probably see some nations try to put things on a blockchain. It might not be the Swiss. In fact, I caused a little furor because I said something about Argentines wanting the ability to buy swiss francs, and there were central bankers from all over the world, but maybe half the room was swiss central bankers and you could hear them all go. Because apparently what I didn't know is that the Swiss are really worried about there being too much demand for the swiss franc. And anyway, oops. But it was fun and interesting.
00:46:06.654 - 00:46:20.680, Speaker E: And they also have the thousand swiss franc node too, though. So they also do stimulate demand for the franc in some ways as well. And so I think that there will be plenty of nations that will decide it's in their best interest.
00:46:22.090 - 00:47:08.260, Speaker C: I think just one more thing to add to that is I don't know if it's that far off in terms of the challenge, because there's actually, aside from the Chinese CBDC, there's already a form of kind of a central digital currency that we all are pretty familiar with, and that's Apple Pay. Apple Pay fundamentally is basically a blockchain that's secured by the secure enclave, the chip on your phone, and under the hood, it's basically a ledger, and they're using that to track who owns what. I think taking that a step further, owned by a central bank, that's the Fed or the US treasury. And making it smart so it can run code has certainly been done by the Chinese, and I think the US government is considering it.
00:47:10.230 - 00:48:13.180, Speaker A: Can we explore? You mentioned the settlements, payment side of things, and I think this gets maybe overlooked a lot, but every country has their own settlement systems, right? We have fedwire chips all sorts in the US, and so on and so on. Do you see a world in which all of that becomes redundant? We move to the transmission of value through a crypto network. So say swift launches one and it becomes the overarching way to transfer funds. Given the amount of technology that's out there today, it's not impossible to think that we could transfer all funds via apps, payment apps. I mean, we've got cash app and Venmo here, and there's all sorts of other stuff around the world. If all of that was linked through one crypto based consensus platform that Swift ran, for example, the international payment network, can you see all these different networks moving to that and falling away? Or is that just not in the best interests of some of the central banks you've spoken to? From your experience, do you think that's just too grand an idea for it to actually happen?
00:48:15.930 - 00:48:41.040, Speaker E: No, I think it's absolutely inevitable. In the same way that back in the 90s when people were talking about commerce happening on the Internet, people laughed and thought it was ridiculous. I think the march of history is inevitable. I'm not like a utopian or anything like that. That's crazy. And there's some of those people in the Ethereum space. A lot of them will be swift adapting or something like that.
00:48:41.040 - 00:49:08.520, Speaker E: It's the existing institutions, largely, that will figure. Many of these will figure these things out, but definitely not everything. I mean, as we saw with the Internet, some people made the jump and some corporations didn't. So Walmart still exists, and Walmart.com is still a big thing. But look at all the retailers that are not here anymore. And I kind of miss some of those.
00:49:08.520 - 00:49:10.870, Speaker E: Can't go to Kmart anymore.
00:49:11.690 - 00:49:26.780, Speaker B: Yeah. Difficult to predict the future. I think when you look in your bank account, you don't look and think, Wells Fargo, US dollars. Here's the amount I have, or chase US dollars. We've done a really good job abstracting that away. It's very fungible. And you just see us dollars, you can transfer those to friends.
00:49:26.780 - 00:49:45.026, Speaker B: We don't have that right now. USDC on harmony is not USDC on Ethereum. So I think it's possible everybody centers around a system like Swift, but it's just as likely that interoperability gets better and there's multiple platforms that you can compose and operate with.
00:49:45.208 - 00:49:48.980, Speaker A: Thank you. There more questions in the room? Yeah, at the back.
00:49:51.110 - 00:50:22.634, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Bryce, and I had a question about a statement earlier made about roll ups, or actually a series of questions. First is like, is this about ZK rollups? And then how much of the developer community could you see is being leaning towards this versus other solutions, like side chains? And what about the progress being made towards roll ups? Makes you say it will be widely.
00:50:22.682 - 00:51:04.566, Speaker E: Implemented in six to nine months? Yeah. Okay, so roll ups. I guess the fundamental reason why roll ups are better than side chains is that side chain bridges are insanely insecure. So people talk about like, yeah, I bridge my thing over from here to there. So what you're actually doing is you're sticking your asset into some code on the blockchain where you have it, and then they're unlocking it on the other blockchain, the receiving blockchain, based on some. Whatever it is. Usually in this case, it is a multi sig.
00:51:04.566 - 00:51:30.820, Speaker E: So it is a four of seven or something like that. Signers, where four people have to agree, and then they can steal all the money that's in the bridge. This doesn't even get into some of the economic realities, which are different. Right. This is literally just the key management aspect of it. We saw Ronan get hacked for half a billion dollars a couple of months ago. In this exact problem.
00:51:30.820 - 00:52:16.514, Speaker E: Multi sigs are really bad solutions. It's risky. You don't want to be having your money in bridges in general. I don't even think it's my contention. I think it's like the history of the last year has shown us that bridges are insanely insecure. So the reason why roll ups are better is that with roll ups, you put the data on chain of the transactions. So instead of trusting a four of seven multi sig or whatever, by the way, avalanche does basically the same thing, except they use SGX, which is, like, such a broken technology that even intel deprecated it.
00:52:16.514 - 00:52:58.078, Speaker E: And they have, like, $10 billion bridged in their SGX side chain bridge. Just, like, fundamentally insane. Kind of characteristic of those people, unfortunately. So, roll ups, what they do is they put their data on chain, right? So I make a transaction on a roll up, and the data goes on Ethereum, and it is there. So fundamentally, the security properties with a mature roll up is the same as using Ethereum. So I feel like I could go on here for like 20 minutes. So I feel like I should stop there because I've already yammered a lot about it.
00:52:58.078 - 00:53:04.130, Speaker E: Maybe we should talk about this later. Or do you want to ask follow up or somebody else can jump in or. I don't know.
00:53:04.280 - 00:53:36.090, Speaker B: I think maybe into prompt, too. The roll ups today are largely optimistic with optimism and arbitram. And so I think the withdrawal time coming down back to l one is a week for someone to publish a fraud proof and essentially say something's not correct here, but the promise of what's coming soon with Zksync, Starknet and others, it's not going to be optimistic in nature where someone needs to disprove it. It can be more atomic and just based off logic. That's promising.
00:53:37.330 - 00:53:42.240, Speaker A: Thanks. Okay, we got time for the last question in the room, if anyone has one.
00:53:43.890 - 00:53:50.718, Speaker E: All right, if you ask a question, though, we can't get pizza until we're done answering questions.
00:53:50.804 - 00:53:57.460, Speaker A: On that note, we'll rush to the pizza. I want to say thank you for all you guys coming. Let's give the panel a round of applause. Thank you very much.
00:54:01.190 - 00:54:01.940, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:03.670 - 00:54:10.530, Speaker A: We'll now break for the drinks and pizza. And please feel free to come up and ask questions maybe too scared to ask on the microphone.
