00:00:00.090 - 00:00:41.290, Speaker A: You everyone. This is our project OTC and access, with which we participated in the channeling Spring Hackathon 2023. So first let me introduce my team. I'm Benny Mino, Daniela Full stack as much contract dev my role was to create the core functionalities of the OTC trades. Then we have Emmanuel Borniersi, smart contract dev, whose role was to create options derivatives, and Alexander Voichik, our test engineer infrastructure which tested thoroughly the smart contracts. And lastly we have Sakshi Shah, our frontend dev. Our protocol serves as a peer to peer marketplace for token trading, primarily targeting whales.
00:00:41.290 - 00:01:43.886, Speaker A: These investors often encounter difficulties in liquidating their positions due to their sizes. Our solution mitigates this issue by allowing whales to avoid, first of all, sandwich attacks on decentralized exchanges. This is particularly beneficial for those holding meme coins, which are typically illiquid and highly volatile. The only downside, the primary downside is that this market can also be liquid since we need a buyer compared to Dex, which typically uses liquidity pools and thus instant trade. Chainlink functions and Chainlink general plays an important role in our application, both as an oracle and also thanks to the newly released chain link functions, they allow OTC Nexus to perform OTC trades using PayPal as a payment provider. By leveraging chainlink functions, both the swap and the PayPal payment are performed entirely on chain, thus reducing approximately to zero the existence of bad actors. Lastly, by integrating such a well known provider as PayPal, our project can be pivotal in embarking new users into web3.
00:01:43.988 - 00:01:46.366, Speaker B: Now let's dive into the demo of.
00:01:46.468 - 00:01:49.950, Speaker A: Channeling functions and PayPal integrations into our DAP.
00:01:51.090 - 00:02:18.294, Speaker B: Our core feature is using channeling function with PayPal. We are making transaction here for example here â‚¬100. Then a message AP 712 will be created asking the user to sign the transaction which will then be sent to the relayer which will pay for the transaction fees and send the transaction. Now we have to use Chatlink functions to accept the payment and proven it.
00:02:18.412 - 00:02:19.346, Speaker A: By running the script.
00:02:19.378 - 00:02:31.194, Speaker B: We are going to approve the payment and it should returns us the order ID. This operation is needed since the protocol needs to act as a middleman for PayPal since we can't approve payments for.
00:02:31.232 - 00:02:34.574, Speaker A: Other users, in this case user A to user B.
00:02:34.692 - 00:02:37.310, Speaker B: So the flow is that the payment.
00:02:37.380 - 00:02:41.214, Speaker A: Is made to our protocol which then send the money back to user b.
00:02:41.252 - 00:03:06.870, Speaker B: After the transaction has been performed. Here we are performing the swap which will be automatized in the contract after the payment is received and we can see that the transaction has been mined and we can look here that the amount of sand has been updated from 129 to 130. Now we just need to send the money to our last users by running this chain link function and this should return us the batch ID of this transaction.
00:03:09.370 - 00:04:30.880, Speaker A: Here we have it. So as to the earlier PayPal payments are common in web two and by allowing users to do the same, web3 will be pivotal for mass adoptions. And we believe that our project has enough potential, especially because our market value autoc is still an untapped market security there are too many risks in P to P trades, especially because by the existence of bad actors stability, we are allowing and protecting new projects from price manipulation by whales accessibility because like we said earlier, we are allowing seamless bridge into web3 using PayPal and thanks to channeling functions and lastly efficiency, we are giving really low gas prices compared to swaps through optimized smart contract functions. In conclusions, we believe that Otis Nexus could really help to shape a new way to introduce new people to web3. And we know that channel link is a key actor in shaping the future web3, especially because in embarking new users and right now giving fantastic tools to developers to interact with real world data and Internet, and especially with CCIP which is the Internet of the blockchain, together with the channel and functions, this will definitely shape the future of web3.
