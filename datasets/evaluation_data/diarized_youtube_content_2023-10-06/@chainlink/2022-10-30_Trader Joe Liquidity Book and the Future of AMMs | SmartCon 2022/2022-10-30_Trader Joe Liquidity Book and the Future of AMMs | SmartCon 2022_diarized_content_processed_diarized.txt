00:00:09.530 - 00:00:36.162, Speaker A: Thank you everyone. We are traditional, as we said. So let's see how many of you have used Trader Joe so far. Oh nice. Thank you for using us. So we are here to talk about Trader Joe, liquidity book and the future of amm. So I am David Defy, the general manager of Trader Joe.
00:00:36.306 - 00:00:40.410, Speaker B: And I'm Louis, the lead smart contract engineer of Trader Joe.
00:00:41.390 - 00:01:42.110, Speaker A: So what is Trader Joe? Trader Joe is the one stop shop, the centralized solution on the avalanche blockchain. We offer 360 experience for any defi user of the avalanche blockchain. This means that through our decks, users can swap one token for another. They can provide their token to liquidity pools. They can stake their liquidity pools into a farm to get extra rewards out of their liquidity positions. We also have modular stacking functionalities of the Joe token into SJO, VGO and Arjo, which support liquidity bootstrapping launches. They support boosted yields and also governance.
00:01:42.110 - 00:02:32.250, Speaker A: We also have lending and borrowing as named as banker Joe. And you might have already tried our recently launched NFT marketplace called Jobex. We are very happy about the quick success that jogs has gotten from our users. We are really doing our best to shape avalanche to be a chain where Defi users and NFT traders can have a lot of fun with the best user experience that we think crypto deserves. And this is the present. But we are here to talk about the future according to our vision. And this is called liquidity book.
00:02:32.250 - 00:02:40.560, Speaker A: And I have our leads. Contract engineer Louis talk more about why liquidity book is going to be so special.
00:02:41.090 - 00:03:16.070, Speaker B: Thanks, Davide. So when you add liquidity to most dexes today, you have to choose the price range, which is zero to infinity. Sorry. With concentrated liquidity, you can tighten the range and choose the price range. So, for example, if the price range is the current price, sorry, is $20, you can add liquidity to a price range of 15 to 25. Or if you want something more tight, you can go from 19 to 21. So the liquidity book pulls liquidity into discriminated bins.
00:03:16.070 - 00:04:07.530, Speaker B: Each bins have its own reserves and its own price inside a bin. Sorry, the price is constant. And so if a user swaps inside a bin, the price will be constant. Here we have a representation of a liquidity pair with a distribution that looks like a gaussian one. This is the active bin and this is the bin that can hold assets, both assets, at a time. And this is the one that sets the market price. If the user position, if the user swap sorry less than the reserve that we have here the swap will occur only in this bin and if the amount is bigger than this, it will occur in multiple bins and the price will increase every time you use a new bin.
00:04:07.530 - 00:05:23.138, Speaker B: The other graph shows a distribution of a liquidity pool, so we can see that the distribution is not uniform and doesn't have to be continuous as well. Each color represents a new liquidity provider and as we can see, every position is different and doesn't have to be the same thing. The liquidity book use a fungible received token for each of its bins. That means that when someone adds liquidity for the first time, he will receive this token and when he adds again he will receive the same token, but it will just increase its balance if it was using nfts. When you add liquidity again, the user will receive again an NFT and if he wanted to withdraw its position, he has to withdraw the entire position every time. Whereas with a fungible approach you can remove a share of the position or only one bin and it allows more efficient liquidity management. For example, we have distribution that we can see here.
00:05:23.138 - 00:06:00.686, Speaker B: The left one is a gaussian one. The two middles are like a more concentrated liquidity distribution and this one is like to capture the volatility of a market. When a user want to swap or add liquidity, he will simply go to the trader Joe interface for a swap. For example, he will choose the two tokens as usual and the router will choose which route is the best to get the more accurate price. It will use the legacy pairs which are the v one and the new one. The liquidity book seamlessly. The user won't have to select for anything about that.
00:06:00.686 - 00:07:20.098, Speaker B: When he has liquidity or want to remove, he just have to select the market and it will work as before. The liquidity book add a search pricing that will measure the volatility in the market and add a variable fee on top of the base fee. So when the market is stable, the users that want to swap will just have a base fee and when the volatility increase so the price are not no more stable, the users will have to pay a variable fee on top of the base fee and this fee will help the liquidity provider mitigate the impairment loss. For example, we can see here that when the price are approximately stable, sorry. Which means that the bin crossed because the bins represent the price. So when there is a lot of crossing, the search pricing is not really increasing and when there is spike of bin crossed, the search pricing will increase and the variable fee will increase as well and when the price goes back to stable then the search pricing will decrease. The liquidity book add a new primitive to the DeFi world and we expect a lot of things to be built on top of the liquidity book.
00:07:20.098 - 00:07:32.640, Speaker B: For example, we expect vaults, we expect limit orders and we expect delta neutral strategies to be prominent and things that you get below top and I will let Davide talk about that.
00:07:34.930 - 00:09:39.910, Speaker A: So we have a very thriving ecosystem of protocols already released on Trader Joe and these represent all the different aspects that DeFi users would like to engage with. But with the introduction of liquidity book, we are going to need new products being built on top of our protocol so that these new functionalities unlocked by liquidity book can be unleashed as we are taking a modular approach when we want to stimulate any builder to rise through the possibilities of what LB is going to give to all of you. And this is why we are partnering with avalabs and Chainlink to launch a liquidity book builders program where anyone that has a good idea on what could be created on top of liquidity book will be able to earn visibility, resources, access, advisory and participant to an exciting contest that we are going to associate with it. So this is definitely the opportunity for any builder among you all to reach to us and to figure out if there is any way for us to support you. Create the next big protocol on avalanche that is built on top of liquidity book. Trader Joe is not only a DefE protocol, it's also a family of passionate builders. We are beyond one year of existence.
00:09:39.910 - 00:11:22.294, Speaker A: The reception that we have gotten from our users has been incredible for all this time. It's lovely to meet you all, but often we hear people like you that ask, how can I participate in Defi? And we are looking not only for people that want to build on top of liquidity book, but also for people that would like to join our team. So this is also a chance to tell you all that if you are looking to join our family, if you are engineer, if you are a marketer, if you are a business developer, if you are a creative, Trader Joe and Jopegs offer a lot of opportunities for you all. And you can message me on Telegram, through the QR code or directly visit our jobs page to see to apply for a position and join our very big and passionate family of builders. I would like to thank you all for having listened to us for this speech and we are open for any questions that you might have on liquidity book. We know that education is going to be definitely important. It's an advanced protocol that we focus a lot on making as simple as usual through the usual trader Joe user experience that they're all used to.
00:11:22.294 - 00:11:30.380, Speaker A: Is there anyone with a question regarding how our concentrated liquidity model works?
00:11:37.910 - 00:11:47.590, Speaker C: Is it similar to that of Uniswap V three? Concentrated liquidity, is it like a fork of Uniswap's new V three mechanism?
00:11:48.490 - 00:12:31.614, Speaker B: It is similar in some approach, but it's different in some other. Like, for example, the fungible liquidity allows for way better management of the liquidity. As I explained, UniviS three works with nfts for a position. And so when a user wants to manage its position, he needs to withdraw the entire position and deposit again and manage its position. Whereas with the fungible way, you can just remove the specific ids or like a share of that specific id that you want to remove and manage. So that allows for more easily management. At the same time, we don't use the same formula.
00:12:31.614 - 00:13:07.310, Speaker B: They use the x times y equal k to shorter range. We use the constant sum formula. So that means inside the bin, the price is constant, whereas with uniswap with three, the price can change inside an id. So that's also a difference. And we have the search pricing on top of that. That means Uniswap only have a fee that's constant over whatever the volatility is. Whereas us, we try to capture the volatility of the market to mitigate the impermanent loss of the users, the liquidity providers.
00:13:07.650 - 00:13:34.070, Speaker A: Also, we are not a fork. Louis is indeed one of the core engineer. He has written the code entirely as a new primitive. So it's trader Joe technology deployed on avalanche to show you that we are a team full of big brains.
00:13:44.410 - 00:13:46.694, Speaker C: Yeah. I didn't mean to offend you.
00:13:46.732 - 00:13:47.030, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:13:47.100 - 00:13:58.650, Speaker C: And I know it's a different framework. I was just thinking if it was, you took some ideas from Uniswap's framework, but, yeah, all good. Thank you.
00:13:58.800 - 00:14:18.430, Speaker B: You're welcome. Is that a question? Oh, currently, I think. Yeah. Blinding up there.
00:14:18.880 - 00:14:19.292, Speaker A: Hi.
00:14:19.346 - 00:14:47.656, Speaker D: Great explanation. Just one question about the fee. You said you have a variable fee related to volatility, but do you think that that may make markets wing even tougher and extreme? Because traders don't jump in because they say, okay, fee is getting too high. So I don't jump in, I don't balance the market. So the crash become even tougher. So at the end of the day, the impairment loss is kind of the same. You have also the issue not having exchanges happening and so on and so forth, basically.
00:14:47.838 - 00:15:33.700, Speaker B: Thank you. That's a great question. We really thought about that because that's an issue. And first of all, there is a max of the variable fee so that we can change it and manage it, and it will be managed so that when we think that the fee is too big or like that we don't see enough volume, we can always manage all the parameters so that it captures the volatility and swaps occurs. The max is a good way to cap things and that's a way to make sure that the swap still occurs. Even if. Forgot my one, even if the volatility is high, the fee will be capped, basically.
00:15:33.850 - 00:15:35.270, Speaker D: Okay. Yeah, clear.
00:15:38.170 - 00:16:05.760, Speaker A: Okay. So we are going to be around available for any question just outside the stage now. We are also going to be the hackathon tomorrow to be available for anyone curious about questions. As mentioned, we will have a builders program that will help anyone building on top. We'll thank you all for listening to us and see you soon.
00:16:06.130 - 00:16:06.540, Speaker B: Thank you.
