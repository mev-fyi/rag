00:00:06.650 - 00:00:29.730, Speaker A: We have another defi panel. This one is going to be on more alpha, the coming Defi derivatives boom. I imagine we have some farmers and traders in the chat, so this should be a good one. Topic is what new financial products are available to Defi users. Let's explore with our moderator, Ash Bennington of real vision, as he leads this panel.
00:00:29.890 - 00:00:39.020, Speaker B: So, let's go around and introduce ourselves. If everyone could just tell us where they're coming to us from, their name, obviously, where you work, and what you do.
00:00:39.710 - 00:01:05.490, Speaker C: Okay. Hey, everyone. I'm Aditia. I'm based on the east coast here in Virginia, just south of DC. I graduated from Duke back in 2013 with a technical degree. I spent a number of years at DRW as a quant trader, and now most recently, excited to be the CEO and co founder of Derividex, which is a new decentralized exchange for derivatives built on top of Ethereum. And thanks for having us on the panel.
00:01:07.430 - 00:01:20.230, Speaker D: Hey, guys, I'm Antonio, the founder of DYDX, coming in from San Francisco. DYDX is one of the leading decentralized exchanges for spot margin and most recently, derivatives trading.
00:01:21.130 - 00:01:22.280, Speaker B: Great. Will.
00:01:22.890 - 00:01:52.510, Speaker E: Hey, I'm Will. I'm the founder of Diversify, which is another self custody exchange. We are one of the first and only exchanges which operates on layer two on Ethereum. So we can have very high number of transaction throughput for traders while still giving them self custody and all the security guarantees of the Ethereum blockchain. And we've been live for two months now on Mainnet. Previously, I worked at Bitfinex, and before that studied engineering at Cambridge.
00:01:53.490 - 00:01:55.786, Speaker B: Great. Welcome back, Gabriel.
00:01:55.978 - 00:01:58.918, Speaker F: Thank you very much. Sorry, I apologize for the inconvenient.
00:01:59.034 - 00:02:07.170, Speaker B: Of course, there was a little bit of backend problems. But if you could just introduce yourself, tell us where you're coming to us from and what company you're at and what you do. Sure.
00:02:07.240 - 00:02:43.310, Speaker F: So, I'm a co founder of RSK and Riff. RSK is the first smart contract platform secured by bitcoin. So, it's a bitcoin side chain, fully compatible with Ethereum. We've been in this space for seven years. RSK started in 2015, but even before that, we collaborated in building the latin american bitcoin and blockchain community. So we've been in this space for quite a long time and very excited to be working on the DeFi space and collaborating with Chainlink and all the other projects, just making this blockchain ecosystem interoperable.
00:02:43.810 - 00:02:45.700, Speaker B: Great. And where are you coming to us from?
00:02:46.310 - 00:02:53.860, Speaker F: So, the project started in Latin America. The co founders are from Argentina. From Argentina, but are currently living in.
00:02:54.390 - 00:03:16.246, Speaker B: Ah, lovely. Very exotic. Cool. Yeah, thanks. So, the name of the session today is more alpha, the coming of the Defi derivatives boom. And it's about the discussion around the new financial products that are available to defi users. So what I'd like to do is go around the horn once more and have you each tell me what that means to you and why you think it's significant.
00:03:16.246 - 00:03:31.070, Speaker B: But there is one rule for the first question only. No undefined jargon. We want to keep it as general as possible, and then we're going to dive into the weeds after that. So just big picture, what is it you're doing? Why do you think this matters? And what do you hope? Go ahead, Aditya.
00:03:32.210 - 00:04:12.646, Speaker C: Yeah, so I can kick things off. This is a really exciting topic, I think, for all of us. Hence we're in this space building derivatives, as everyone knows, is a massive market. I mean, the idea of a derivative is it's something that, as the name suggests, derives its value from an underlying asset. So the problem space is quite massive and there's really unlimited potential for what can be represented. And so it's a really exciting space to be building in for that reason. Right? People are looking to trade with, speculate, hedge, arbitrage, with all sorts of underlying products, as per their risk profile.
00:04:12.646 - 00:05:10.042, Speaker C: And so to be able to create products that are useful for any number of people is something that's really exciting. And one of the things that we've seen happen in the space right now in DeFi is actually something that's taken place in centralized finance, but just at a hyper, hyper accelerated pace. Right? So in centralized finance, and in particular in the crypto markets, you have kind of the spot trading on Mount Gox or Coinbase that started in the early two thousand and ten s, and then that sort of gave way to margin lending and trading on Bitfinex. And then the ICO craze sort of died down in 2017 2018 time frame. And then you saw derivatives in the centralized context, namely BitMex, I think, pioneered it, and then also finance, FTX, et cetera, have come a little bit more recently. And it's really just taken the trading world by storm. Right? The volumes for these just far, far outweigh that of their spot or fixed expiry futures counterparts.
00:05:10.042 - 00:06:09.700, Speaker C: And what we're seeing in DeFi is this same type of narrative, right? So you had some of these ether deltas or zero x based relayers, and then more recently, give way to DYDX, some of the margin trading products out there, and now perp products that are really coming in batches now. And it's really exciting to see the evolution and the rate of progress that we're seeing take place. And I think we're seeing this explosion of growth of platforms, not just in the structure of the products, not just in the underlyings they represent, but also in the way they're fundamentally executed. Right. Whether they're done via open order books, amms, and we can talk more about this as the discussion goes along. But the point is that it's a very rapidly evolving space, and I think Defi has a very unique opportunity to cater to just a truly wide array of customers and user bases in a really strong fashion that centralized context can't quite do.
00:06:10.150 - 00:06:11.966, Speaker B: Great. Antonio?
00:06:12.158 - 00:06:39.802, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that was an amazing introduction, so thanks for that. I would echo basically everything you said. Well put. But yeah, basically the reason I am excited about it is just due to kind of the size of the market and also how we've seen just markets traditionally evolve over time. Like Aditya alluded to. Basically, in traditional markets, markets usually start with the simple types of trading, like spot trading kind of evolve to more complicated things like margin and derivatives over time. I think with kind of like the reason that.
00:06:39.802 - 00:07:14.178, Speaker D: I think it makes a lot of sense for derivatives to be on Defi is just for a lot of reasons that we've seen a lot of the spot trading activity move over to Defi. Things like self custody, things like being able to trade tons of different assets which you may not have available on centralized exchanges. And that's really exciting to me. I really think of finance and decentralized finance as well as like a stack. So kind of at the bottom of the stack you have things like just assets. So first blockchain kind of came up with decentralized assets. So things like bitcoin, ethereum.
00:07:14.178 - 00:07:41.390, Speaker D: Then after that, in the stack, it's kind of things like buy sell exchanges. So three years ago, we saw things like zero x Kyber kind of come out and be the first decentralized ways to trade assets on spot. Then after that, kind of the next level of complexity is like margin trading. And then kind of the pinnacle is like derivatives. And I think that's where we're getting to right now. So I think it's not that far off where we'll see a really big boom come in derivatives products like we saw in centralized exchanges.
00:07:41.970 - 00:07:43.360, Speaker B: Excellent, will.
00:07:44.130 - 00:08:35.078, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree with a lot of that. I think the biggest excitement, from my point of view, in terms of decentralized derivatives, is actually the breadth of what that can mean. And so typically, when we think about derivatives, particularly in crypto at the moment, people often think about perpetual futures as being one way that people can speculate on cryptocurrencies, and especially as the market matures. I think there's a sign that because of the reducing volatility potentially, and more sophistication of traders, that these are kind of products that people want to trade. But actually, I think derivatives can mean a lot more than that. And really what we're representing is you have some underlying assets, whether those are on blockchain or not, and being able to build more complex or more interesting trading assets or products on top of those. Some of the potential use cases are also, for example, for staked tokens.
00:08:35.078 - 00:09:18.560, Speaker E: So being able to then build things that may be wanting to trade in the underlying assets, where tokens are staked or held and locked in various different systems. And increasingly, those are things which people will be interested in. And so there's a very broad and flexible range of products which could be built, and those in some cases, can be built better in a decentralized system, because it's composable, and because the logic is defined in smart contracts or in other type of cryptography, then it could be built using contracts in a legal sense. And that will lead to much faster and much more rapid innovation. And that's the thing that is really exciting about this for us.
00:09:19.890 - 00:09:36.386, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's interesting. One of the things that's interesting to me about this topic is how potentially broad it is. I'm curious to know, what are the topics that interest you the most in this space? Non recourse? Leverage? Is it lending? Is it margin? Anyone who'd like to jump in, if you want?
00:09:36.408 - 00:10:23.890, Speaker F: Ash, I can give you my take on this. I would like to divide the answer in two. On one hand, I'm super excited to see the level of innovation and open source technology that we're seeing in DeFi, and these amazing solutions that the guys mentioned before. Just mind blowing. I've never seen this rate of innovation in the traditional centralized finance solutions. Now, what really made us create RSK in the first place was the dream of using blockchain technology and decentralized finance to really create a deep change in our global society. So we live in a world where 50% of the global population are excluded.
00:10:23.890 - 00:11:53.710, Speaker F: And it was actually the component of decentralization that bitcoin brought to the table that enabled us to have a financial system with no KYC that anyone can use. And this is what excites me the most about DeFi. I love to see the super complicated, innovative solutions, but I am still not done with the first part. I want us, as a global community and ecosystem, to build solutions that can really transform the lives of billions of users that require extremely low cost, extremely simple to use financial solutions to do, nanotransactions that can invite them to participate in the global economy. So when we talk about derivatives, the dream that we had when we started building RSK was the possibility of issuing stable coins for different emerging markets, like Argentina, Brazil, african countries, India, with collateral in. And at the beginning of this year, there's a project that is currently live in RSK that's called money on chain, which issued the first stable coin with collateral in bitcoin. And the idea is that this is a first of a set of stable coins that will be able to be issued with bitcoin as collateral.
00:11:53.710 - 00:12:32.960, Speaker F: And this is the kind of derivatives that I think the world needs the most. When I'm saying the world, I always think that defi, if we only do defi for us, like people in this call or even in this conference, then we are not changing anything. I mean, it's a very cool technology, but basically the world and the global society will continue to go the path that it's been on, and even might get even worse or more defi can bring to help us build a better society. This is what excites me the most.
00:12:33.330 - 00:12:45.554, Speaker B: Yeah, that's great. In fact, I liked your frame so much, Gabriel. I'll rephrase the question that way. What are the products or services that DeFi derivatives can provide that the world needs most? Sure.
00:12:45.592 - 00:14:12.938, Speaker E: So, I mean, definitely one of the use cases that's sort of, I think, going to be most widely useful and applicable is, as mentioned, stablecoins. So I think Dai is a clear example of what is essentially a synthetic asset derivative that's built and collateralized on ethereum. And clearly that can happen on other blockchains as well. That's something where you have a permissionless asset which can be transferred without any government or otherwise controls. And I think that's something that feeds into what we're seeing as being the kind of major growth around all sort of defi products, whether derivatives or sort of spot tokens of any type, which is really the kind of permissionlessness, first of all, which allows people to build on top of things, often list tokens, or create anything they want around the existing building blocks the composability of being able to interact with various different systems within what you're building. So you do get these building blocks which are adding on top of each other, of which, for example, a global stablecoin or some sort of hedging derivative product can be a piece of the overall puzzle. And then particularly the kind of transparency and the auditability that you get from having all of this happening on chain, as opposed to in a kind of legal framework.
00:14:12.938 - 00:14:52.854, Speaker E: And so I'd say that particularly those most fundamental building blocks, like decentralized stablecoins, are probably going to be some of the things that can be most useful globally. That said, personally, I'm not really a believer that derivatives, particularly like perpetual futures for speculation, are ever going to be world changing or bring more people, include more people into our financial system than happens in the traditional world. That's just something I think is not really very likely and the rich get richer, but there are obviously certain things that will do that. Yeah.
00:14:52.892 - 00:15:27.918, Speaker D: If I were to just piggyback back off that, I totally agree with most of the things that you guys said. I agree. That's basically the goal for all of us. I think, like working in blockchain. And I think something, Gabriel, that the stuff you were talking about that brought all of us to the space, I think if I were to just take it a step further in terms of how derivatives can help that, obviously, with kind of new financial products like crypto backed stablecoins, great use case. The one thing I would say is, know if we want crypto to be big, we need there to be really liquid markets for crypto, and we need those markets to be stable. We need them to have derivative products where you can express complex price expressions.
00:15:27.918 - 00:16:10.900, Speaker D: You need to be able to let arbitragers bet on volatility. There needs to be transparency in the markets. And what we've really seen in the crypto market so far is just like most of the crypto trading, and basically all of the crypto derivatives trading kind of goes on on offshore exchanges, which are not regulated. They don't have necessarily the best transparency in terms of what's going on under the hood. And I think that that's where Defi can kind of come in, inject a lot of this really good transparency into the market, kind of as will was talking about. Replace a lot of the legal contracts with smart contracts, replace some of the laws with code. And I think that's a really great outcome for the space as a whole and kind of the health of the market.
00:16:11.670 - 00:17:04.882, Speaker C: Yeah. Definitely agree with everyone so far. I think one of the areas that is particularly interesting to me is just the concept of leverage, right? That's one of the beauties of derivative products, allows people to really achieve this level of capital efficiency and take on leverage in high numbers. Certainly in crypto it's common to see these 100 plus x, which is kind of wild. Haven't quite seen that in defi yet, but I think it's an interesting question, and I don't think DFI has quite gone there yet. And again, I know there are these perp products, derividex being one of them, Dydx of course, others as well, that are launching this. But right now, what we're seeing a lot of people do in Defi is they do this yield farming, these crop rotations, whatever you want to call it, and sort of indirectly lever up their collateral, right.
00:17:04.882 - 00:18:10.362, Speaker C: By going like several iterations through the think will. I certainly agree with you, by the way. I think we can and should and will go well beyond perpetual swaps. But one of the things to slightly push back, if you don't mind, is that I think perpetual swaps do allow people, in theory, if they're robustly built to more from a capital efficiency standpoint, achieve the levels of leverage that they would like a little more directly. So I think that is one strong use case for it. And then also to Antonio's point, the overall ecosystem of tradable products is actually very interconnected, right? So for example, a like on the perpetual markets, it actually turns out that a lot of institutional clients, they certainly are trading these products, but a lot of them actually are sticking to fixed expiry futures or even spot where there's a little more regularity and certainty, as opposed to the funding rate, whereas a lot of retail. So a lot of these new traders that previously hadn't entered the markets are participating on BitMex and the likes of that.
00:18:10.362 - 00:19:05.210, Speaker C: So I think we'll see that influx in the defi space also as these products get more well built out. And then also, as I was saying, there is this level of everything being intertwined with each other. So, for example, putting on this basis trade where you can take on a perpetual position and then take on an offsetting position on a more traditionally structured market, like a future or a spot. So to Antonio's point, increasing these types of products, even if that's not the end game, does increase the overall liquidity of the market and allow people that may not be actually participating on perpetual swaps, but can execute on other avenues in a more capital efficient and a stronger manner per their kind of trading strategies. So I think we'll see that happen in Defi.
00:19:06.350 - 00:19:19.200, Speaker B: I'm curious, we've just talked a little bit about where we think the boat is going. I'm curious about where you guys think we are right now. What's the current state of the ecosystem, and what some of the gaps are that we need to cross in order to get to where we're going.
00:19:21.410 - 00:21:00.602, Speaker F: If you want, I can start at this. I think it's very interesting what has happened in the world in the last six months, because it's one thing where we were at the end of last year, and this is another different thing, is where we are now. And not only because all the innovation that has happened on the Defi ecosystem, but also we are witnessing the collapse of the traditional system. From a geopolitical standpoint, from a financial system, I see a huge probability of the swift system collapsing and seeing the Internet broken into two with the US and China on an open technological and financial battlefield. And I also expect fiat currencies to go through a period of extremely high inflation and probably going back to some kind of gold standard or bitcoin standard. So I think it's interesting to analyze the defi and blockchain ecosystem crypto in that context, because we're going through a phase of change that we've never seen before in the history of humankind, and definitely not in our lifetimes. So I think everyone in crypto, or everyone who understands how bitcoin works somehow feels a little bit more safe or secure, in the sense that if everything collapses, there is a safety net that we can go and look for shelter to protect our long term life savings.
00:21:00.602 - 00:22:03.554, Speaker F: This is happening in Argentina right now. This is happening in Venezuela. We were talking about adoption. And I think when the financial system collapses, or when the users really need this technology, the adoption curve just explodes as the survival instinct that lets you learn whatever you need to learn to benefit from the technology. And what I hope doesn't happen, but kind of what I see this going is I believe that the trust problem between the US and its allies, and China and the TikTok issue and the 5G, it's probably going to lead us to a financial system broken into two, where you have to choose whether you want to use WeChat money or Facebook money, or western money. Western Internet. And I really hope that the Defi ecosystem can also bridge this, because when all this started, it was kind of a cyberpunked mode for us.
00:22:03.554 - 00:22:26.620, Speaker F: To protect from governments and corporations, which I definitely think is really much needed. But I didn't see it coming that maybe DeFi and bitcoin and crypto in general could be the bridges that will keep the global society united in case the financial system and the lack of trust between the parties breaks everything into.
00:22:27.390 - 00:23:01.400, Speaker B: Know that's such an important .1 of the things. And first of all, to bring in the international perspective, which is absolutely critical and something that we sometimes lose sight of when it's just us based persons who are having the conversation. And second, to talk about some of those risks that are inherent. We have, for example, some of the plumbing in the traditional financial system like swift, could in fact be bifurcated if there is a substantial economic or trade cold war with China. So it's a very interesting point. Anyone else, in terms of the state of where we are today and what some of the gaps are, or even risks, as Gabriel maybe phrased it?
00:23:02.410 - 00:23:38.258, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe just zooming in a little bit more, totally echo all of that stuff that Gabriel was talking about, but maybe just zooming in on what's actually going on with DeFi derivatives today. I think where we are right now is that in DeFi, the spot markets are very dominant. There are some margin markets like Dydx, a couple other platforms. It's like some derivatives markets, but it's still very focused on spot trading. And I think that's the case for a number of different reasons. We haven't really, for the most part, moved to layer two, scalability, of course, things like diversify are like pioneering there, DyDx soon to move to layer two as well. That's a big problem, especially for collateralization and stuff.
00:23:38.258 - 00:24:19.230, Speaker D: We need more liquidity, so there's more market makers moving into the space, but there's not that many market makers that are comfortable trading on a decentralized exchange compared to centralized exchanges right now. So there's a lot of things I think we need to level up on for the DeFi space as a whole, and especially with more advanced financial products, a lot of really new, exciting projects that are coming out, like derividex soon as well, which I think will really help a lot with that. DyDx just innovating a lot on our existing perpetual products. So it's like super early days right now for derivatives on Defi, I guess, is the TLDR. But all of us are doing a lot of work to really level up on all these aspects, and I think it will improve a lot. Like even in the next year or so I think we'll be sitting here having a very different conversation.
00:24:20.690 - 00:24:23.374, Speaker B: Checklist. That's great. Go ahead, jump in. Idea.
00:24:23.572 - 00:24:25.780, Speaker C: Sorry, will, I didn't mean to cut you off. Go for it.
00:24:26.950 - 00:25:13.278, Speaker E: Essentially, I think we're at that position where proof of concept has happened, especially for spot trading. Now there's a shift happening for Defi, and it's sort of unstoppable. And it will keep just that. The momentum on that will keep growing. And derivatives are maybe slightly further back on that, in that there are DyDx and others who have very sort of complex and well designed derivative systems, but which don't yet scale, but which will very soon. I think the challenge is going to come to all of that from maybe another direction as well, which is that in scaling these systems, which is definitely also proven, diversify is already live, as are some others. Now, on a layer two scaling system, we are going to see another sort of challenge, which is the composability, sort of between these different layer two systems, and between layer two and layer one.
00:25:13.278 - 00:25:43.530, Speaker E: And that is something that's particularly important for derivatives, where you may want to link various different systems together and have oracles and other liquidation conditions and the ability for people to quickly arbitrage between various systems sort of built in. And so there's going to be a real blocker on the composability, technical challenges, which I think will again be solved in a year's time. But that's still something where there's no clear solution.
00:25:44.110 - 00:26:05.322, Speaker C: Yeah. To add to what everyone said, I couldn't agree more. I think what I've seen in the space is there's a lot of ironies at play in crypto. Go figure for one, for example, and this is sort of the start of centralized exchanges. You have these, as Antonio mentioned, you have these decentralized assets that are being traded on centralized venues.
00:26:05.386 - 00:26:05.854, Speaker D: Right?
00:26:05.972 - 00:26:51.822, Speaker C: Which fundamentally is kind of an irony at play right there and then. Now, what we're seeing in DeFi is two of the big, and there's many, but two of the big theoretical advantages that DeFi brings to the table. One is that theoretically there should be low cost, right? Like, you don't have this middleman that's taking a giant trading fee, taking a giant cut, but there are massive gas costs, even like small, simple transfers or approvals. Forget all the complex things that our systems are all doing. This is prohibitively expensive, and so the cost ends up being passed on either to the platform or to the user, which creates a really, again, prohibitively expensive experience, which is not really. Kind of one of the advantages that theoretically DeFi offers. And then also on that same point, there should be a low barrier to entry, right.
00:26:51.822 - 00:27:17.010, Speaker C: For anyone. Right. There shouldn't be. These KYC regulations be able to be cross jurisdictional, et cetera. But what you see also is like fundamental UX issues, right? And so when those are at play, it's very difficult to actually get a lot of users participating. And so while those problems exist, I'm excited to share this stage, or I guess metaphorical stage, with these individuals. Everyone is working on it really rapidly.
00:27:17.010 - 00:27:45.600, Speaker C: We've seen, I know TbL is not exactly the best metric, but back in June, there was a billion dollars locked up. Now there's ten, right? So it is rapidly exploding. The rate of development is through the roof like a rocket ship. So it's very exciting. There's a lot of smart people working on this. The community is growing, so I know we'll get there. But I think these are some of the issues at play right now that certainly need to be solved in order for DFI and derivatives in particular to go from that one to 1000.
00:27:45.970 - 00:27:46.720, Speaker D: Really.
00:27:48.850 - 00:27:56.486, Speaker A: Thank you to the rest of the panelists too. I'm sorry, I have to jump in here. We need to move on to our next presentation. It was great insight though, guys, really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
00:27:56.588 - 00:27:57.878, Speaker D: Thanks so much for having us.
00:27:57.964 - 00:27:58.530, Speaker C: Thanks, Ashley.
