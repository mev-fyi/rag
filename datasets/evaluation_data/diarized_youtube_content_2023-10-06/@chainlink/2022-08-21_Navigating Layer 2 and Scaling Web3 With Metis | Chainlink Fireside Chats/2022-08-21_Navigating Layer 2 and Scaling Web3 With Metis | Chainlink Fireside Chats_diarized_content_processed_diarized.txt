00:00:06.010 - 00:00:26.440, Speaker A: First of all, thanks, everybody, for coming out. We really appreciate it. This is going to be a great conversation here. Really just want to kick things off by getting an introduction from our guests. If you could just tell us a little bit about yourself. And how about as a fun icebreaker, what's one exciting thing you're looking forward to doing in Toronto this week?
00:00:27.850 - 00:01:11.680, Speaker B: Thank you guys for coming here. And thank you so much for inviting us. My name is Alina Sinelnikova. I am CEO and co founder of Mitis and also I'm a co founder of Crypto Chicks with Natalia. This weekend in Toronto, it's a huge weekend for us because it's the eat Toronto and it's the first time ever in history we have an eat Toronto. So we have been dreaming of it since, I think, 2016 when first we got to know Tracy and we came up with this with the idea, let's do it, let's do it. And then finally, now we've done it and it's going really well.
00:01:11.680 - 00:01:33.290, Speaker B: So that's the plan for this weekend, just to attend the event. And thank you for inviting us here. It's been great week for us as well because we just announced this week, we announced the Chainlink integration and we're really happy to chainlink to join us in the Midis ecosystem.
00:01:34.990 - 00:02:04.500, Speaker C: Hi, guys. Thank you for coming. My name is Natalia Amelin. I am a co founder of Cryptocix and I'm also lead of Genesee investment fund at Metis. I'm super happy that you showed up. I know it's a lot of fun activities going on back at Rebel, so I'm super grateful that you're here and looking forward to meeting some of you later.
00:02:06.070 - 00:02:28.220, Speaker A: Thank you very much. So to start off, I think there's a wide range of knowledge amongst the crowd. I'd love to just get a few key concepts explained to kick things off. Maybe to start with yourself. Natalia, could you, from a high level, explain the blockchain trilemma problem, what that is and why that's important?
00:02:29.870 - 00:03:09.850, Speaker C: Interesting question. So, blockchain, it's. I think it's a widely held belief that the modern decentralized network can support only two out of three properties that describe the blockchain. So when we talk about the blockchain, we think about decentralization. So decentralization. When we talk about decentralization, we refer to the meaningful distribution of consensus and computation across the network. Second main part of it is scalability.
00:03:09.850 - 00:04:15.406, Speaker C: And scalability is, of course, the ability of the blockchain to process transactions and transactional throughput, and increase it without clogging the blockchain. And we also have the aspect of security, which is also very important, and that's a very important aspect for all of us. We don't want to put our financial, I guess, our money into something that is not secure. So that is the three aspects of the blockchain trilemma. And as I was saying earlier, it is believed that only two out of three can be supported by the modern blockchain. And we're always compromising on a third. So when we think about, for example, bitcoin or ethereum, we think that they are decentralized, they're secure, but maybe not as scalable because the transaction throughput is relatively small, right? We're talking about twelve transaction per second on Ethereum, for example.
00:04:15.406 - 00:04:35.618, Speaker C: Right? And when we talk the private blockchains, they could be secure, they could be scalable, but they are compromising on decentralization because there is a limited number of nodes that are processing the transactions. I think that's kind of my take on it.
00:04:35.704 - 00:04:53.450, Speaker A: No, that's fantastic. And the follow up question to that, to yourself, Alina, would be, could you then explain what is the difference between a layer one and a L2? And how does mite step in to approach the problems that were mentioned earlier?
00:04:54.830 - 00:05:43.130, Speaker B: I'm glad that Natalia got the hardest question and I got the easy one. So layer one and L2. Layer one is of course the main blockchain. Like in our case, for example, this is Ethereum. So this is a blockchain that is decentralized, but at the same time it has some problems, such as scalability, which result in a low transaction throughput and the cost of the transactions, sometimes the fees, the transaction fees are really high. Not at the moment, but sometime back in the days when there was a lot of load onto Ethereum, transactions could be cost $100, $200. And that is of course not feasible.
00:05:43.130 - 00:06:47.834, Speaker B: So in this case, L2 come to the rescue. So L2 is the system that builds on top of layer one, which is in this case Ethereum, and architecture of it. It's not a chain by itself, but it is the system that collects transactions and then commits them to basically saves transactions. Let's say in case of the optimistic roll up in a batch, as one transaction to the Ethereum. And in this case, it inherits ethereum security. So because the transaction gets saved onto the layer one, onto Ethereum, and it does not need any consensus, because this is just wrapping up the transaction and saving, wrapping up transactions and saving. So there's not much logic into it and there's no consensus, and therefore the security is inherited, and it's also supposed to have only one honest sequencer.
00:06:47.834 - 00:07:26.650, Speaker B: Sequencer is basically the program that actually submits these transactions to the network. And even if a sequencer is not honest, nothing happens to the transactions because you cannot save kind of like wrong transactions onto the layer one. Anyways, this process just stops if you have a dishonest sequencer. But in this case, nothing happens to the accounts or the security, so no money getting lost. So that's what L2 is. It's basically the layer that inherits the security from the layer one and makes transactions faster and cheaper.
00:07:28.430 - 00:07:38.430, Speaker A: Fantastic. And could you then maybe expand on that with what is Metis and what makes it special in the L two ecosystem?
00:07:39.730 - 00:08:28.254, Speaker B: Yes, the idea of mitis is not just the L two or infrastructure. So we built this infrastructure because Metis idea is to build an economy, decentralized economy. So for that, of course, we need this decentralized base layer that is very usable. Ethereum is a good decentralized layer, but unfortunately it's not usable in our case, because again, the low transaction throughput and expensive transactions. So for that we needed to build our own L2 in order to even debase our economy on something. So that's what we did. We started with the optimistic roll up, then we upgraded it to smart l two, how we call it.
00:08:28.254 - 00:09:31.090, Speaker B: So when the transactions is not saved all at once, or the whole batch, but it actually does it on demand. And so therefore it allowed us to bring the cost of the transactions to just a few cents, a couple of cents on Ethereum, and the transaction throughput is very fast. I cannot tell you the number, I'm sorry. But yes, if you try meteors, the transactions are momentarily very fast. And based on that, now we are building, and we continuously building the system of the DeC. It's decentralized autonomous companies which allow any person to create business just with one click of a button and be in an open environment, in an open ecosystem, without even knowing that they are on Ethereum. So this is the idea for meteors to create this economy of the businesses that are all interconnected with each other.
00:09:31.090 - 00:09:32.660, Speaker B: And that's what we're building.
00:09:34.550 - 00:10:03.326, Speaker A: Exciting stuff. Absolutely. I was listening to a podcast on the way up here, and I heard a story of how you actually got introduced to crypto, Alina, and I believe it was Natalia, asked for your help to set up a wallet way back in 2014. So that's a long time ago. I would love to hear. 1415 still a long time. I would love to hear.
00:10:03.326 - 00:10:15.710, Speaker A: And if you could tell the audience, how have you seen this industry grow and develop since that time? What are some key takeaways that you've seen? And then what led you to joining Metus?
00:10:16.050 - 00:10:53.934, Speaker C: Yeah. For, you know, I was lucky enough to start following the blockchain space from early days, and that was, of course, very special. At some point, we started getting our hands, I guess, wet and using the blockchain itself. But what is the first step? Right? The first step is wallet. So I was trying to set up mist wallet at the time, and my computer just kept spinning and spinning and spinning. I think the wallet sucked, but that's my excuse. But I couldn't figure it out.
00:10:53.934 - 00:11:10.660, Speaker C: So I said, hey, I have my fellow computer scientist with 20 years of experience in coding, so why don't I ask her help? And we were trying eventually have to get help from my son, and it worked out.
00:11:11.110 - 00:11:17.480, Speaker B: It was the other way around. You first get help from your son who couldn't help you, and then I helped you.
00:11:18.490 - 00:12:03.554, Speaker C: All right. It's good that he's not here. Right? So anyway, to get the long story short, eventually it worked out, and we never used the meter since then. That was my takeaway. Do not use the mist wallet. So in terms of what we've seen in the space since then, obviously it has been a wild ride for everybody, I think, who've been following it from the early days. We saw the first hack, the Dow hack, that I think was very impactful in many ways and kind of started shaping the culture and shaping the thought processes and communities in Ethereum space.
00:12:03.554 - 00:13:15.610, Speaker C: And in the beginning, it was just bitcoin and Ethereum. Right? And now we look around and I think there is a whole bunch of the. It's almost like a sub blockchain space that was created because people see a problem that the large Brooks blockchain have in terms of the ability to scale and handle the transactions. And as the demand on the network kept growing and growing because more people, more businesses started building on a blockchain, it was more and more obvious that we need to come up with a solution to scale Ethereum. So now we have almost like a subcategory of the space, which is focusing on various scaling solutions. Right? And so we are meteors, of course, is one of them, but there are very many, and they all have their individual approaches to this. And I think what we see and what we specifically care about at Metis, and I think I'm talking on behalf of everybody in our team, is the decentralization.
00:13:15.610 - 00:13:58.594, Speaker C: I think that's something why this space was created back in the days to start with, because we wanted to have the freedom, we wanted to not depend on centralized parties. We wanted to own our own funds, be our own bank and own our own identities. And I think the people who cared about it, they're still in the space. And that's one of the most important things why we come to work every day at MIDIS. We really focusing on maintaining decentralization. We're not compromising. And that's, I think what I think will be even more important in the coming days.
00:13:58.594 - 00:14:35.700, Speaker C: When I look around, I read the news every day, I see that there are some infringement on people's freedoms. You probably all heard about the tornadic cash decision. And more and more I think it becomes prevalent that decentralization is really important in this space. And in the past several days, quite frankly, I mean several years, I think we kind of maybe get a little bit away from that theme and started focusing more on becoming faster, cheaper, but sometimes, unfortunately, at the expense of decentralization. And I think this is not an acceptable position.
00:14:37.370 - 00:14:49.020, Speaker A: Very inspirational. That was excellent to hear. I'd love to pass it over yourself, Alina. And what kind of insights could you share from your extensive experience in this space?
00:14:52.590 - 00:15:38.202, Speaker B: Yes, I would like to continue with Natalia. And we are very big fan of decentralization. That's why I speak for myself. But that's why I got into the space, because when I started reading books about bitcoin at the moment it was not clear in books back then. And then it started studying Ethereum. That was so amazing that there is systems that were programmed, supposedly by humans, but they can work without any human interaction and that they can self sustain, self regulate, and as well provide this open environment for everybody. No matter what status you are, like, what status you have in society or what country you live in, or how much money you have.
00:15:38.202 - 00:16:24.726, Speaker B: So it's completely available. So I consider this kind of like a perfect democracy, that right now in the world everybody's fighting for, but it's right there at our fingertips. So this technology already exists. But what the most important insight for me is that decentralization is not for everyone. Decentralization is for people that has this sense of accountability and responsibility. And that is something that I learned actually this year. So I'm already that much, that long in space since 2015.
00:16:24.726 - 00:17:16.118, Speaker B: But yeah, suddenly this year it occurred to me that we need to prioritize and prioritize over to the people that has responsibility, accountability. Not everybody happy in a decentralized environment start with the private key, for example, right? So that people are, they are losing private keys and they would rather afflode this responsibility to somebody else to hold these keys. And let's be honest, this is not for them. But when we're building, we need to make sure that we are building for people who actually will be happy and they will be happy to use it and that will be so much easier to focus on that people. So that is my big insight. And I know probably I will have lots of opponents and say, oh yeah, no, let's build it for everybody. And I can tell you it's probably not possible.
00:17:16.118 - 00:17:22.460, Speaker B: So let's focus on the right people. So decentralization starts with people, not with the technology.
00:17:23.630 - 00:18:02.360, Speaker A: That's a great line right there. Decentralization starts with people, not technology. Thank you for that, Elena. I want to shift gears here and talk about the metus ecosystem because we've seen some really amazing stuff happening. Some top dapps are building on medus, I think ave sushi swap, cheetah to name a few. We just had chain link price feeds go live August 3, I believe so, yeah. How is the metas ecosystem growing? And could you talk a bit about the ecosystem growth plans for the future?
00:18:05.850 - 00:18:51.110, Speaker C: Okay, I will start, maybe we'll go one after another. So first and foremost, as Alina was saying before, our goal is to be building a backbone of the web3 economy, right? So it all starts with infrastructure. So continue on my topic of decentralization in the next six months based on our roadmap, which I'm sure you all read about, or will read about if you Google. One of the things that we're focusing on is continuing with enhancement in technology that will help with decentralization. So that's one of the things that I am looking forward in our roadmap.
00:18:52.810 - 00:19:37.334, Speaker B: Yeah. And that is involved building the whole system of the decentralized sequencers, the fraud proofers. So it's not be like, as I said, when the sequencer go down, L2s are still centralized in that sense. But yes, we're building a system where the sequencers is going to be multiple and they're going to be all decentralized and belong to the community as well. That is a big part of the roadmap. Also, we are focusing on our building DC. So the docs, how you say, the decentralized autonomous company infrastructure, the tooling for it, and even right now we have a base tooling for that.
00:19:37.334 - 00:20:45.798, Speaker B: And we already see this decentralized autonomous companies that are emerging and they are becoming the cornerstone of Metis ecosystem and Metis roadmap itself. So the whole business of Mitis is decentralized and will be consist of this DACs that will be leading the main business lines of Mitis. The first one that just got emerged is the matrix reputation power. So that's the decentralized autonomous company that built the reputation power that is going to be in use for the whole Metis ecosystem. The reputation power badges. It's been launched yesterday, already released into the community. So now they're going to be going around all these badges and it will allow people think of these badges like a credit score, for example, so you can have them displayed, displayed all your merits displayed, all your accomplishments, all your credit scores.
00:20:45.798 - 00:21:31.020, Speaker B: And that's how the people and companies can see who they can interact with or who they choose not to interact with. So this is a cornerstone of the future economy and we plan to emerge and to help further decentralized autonomous companies that are going to be autonomous if they're going to be building their own thing under their own management and funding. So the meteor's founding team will not be the central authority to tell what to do, but the community takes over. So that is what our plan.
00:21:32.750 - 00:21:56.260, Speaker A: Thank you for that. And just to kind of clarify, I'm sure a lot of people have heard of DAos, decentralized autonomous organizations. So Miteas, you then have dacs. Could you kind of just explain why someone would set up a DAC versus a DaO or would they set up both? What is your suggestion there?
00:21:56.870 - 00:23:05.830, Speaker B: Yes, the Dow indicates as the community. So the community, but the DC, the company corporation or the company that carries some business, right from definition, it has to be sustainable. It has to produce certain product or something. It has to produce the product and it has to be, well, it's not necessarily can be kind of like decentralized inside of the DC, but it has to have some sort of form of management of the governance inside. But it can be centralized. So decentralized, autonomous company in a sense, it could be centralized, it could be decentralized, but it has to carry on the business line, has the business model, sustainable business model, and it has to be also performing the business model for the good of the ecosystem.
00:23:06.890 - 00:23:10.710, Speaker A: Got it. Did you have anything to add to that, Natalia?
00:23:11.690 - 00:23:52.630, Speaker C: No, I think Kalina covered think, you know, with DACs, I kind of think about it as the maybe dao on steroids. Right. So DAos have some functionality which today traditionally is maybe a bit limited to kind of organization which is primarily used for maybe voting for governance structures when with DACs it's really built for businesses to run on. So it will have a little bit more of enhanced functionalities. Maybe it's charity DAC, maybe it's an investment DC. So it has to be able to support this, I guess. Functionalities.
00:23:54.250 - 00:24:01.320, Speaker A: Very interesting. And it's quite easy to spin up a DAC, is that right? Just very intuitive on your website.
00:24:01.690 - 00:24:28.260, Speaker B: Yeah. So if you go to portal Mitis IO, we already built kind of like first version of it and yeah, we had testers that created like I don't know, 7000 DCs already. But yes, our goal right now is to build further. So we're going to be releasing next version soon. Yes, it's supposed to just take one click of a button to do that.
00:24:29.430 - 00:24:42.070, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, on that note, just kind of wrapping things up here. What's next for Metis in the future? What are some exciting things that you're looking forward to further down the roadmap?
00:24:43.210 - 00:24:58.700, Speaker C: Well, I think we talked already about some of the things that we're excited about immediately. Right. So I'm in particular excited about our match matrix, which is our reputation system. I think you're going to have a lot of fun with it. Absolutely. Go and try it. We launched it.
00:24:58.700 - 00:25:24.130, Speaker C: I think I am excited to see our community grow. This second half of the year the focus will be on and I guess bringing Chainlink is kind of a stepping stone to that vision. Right? So bringing in more established players into our network as well as growing our homegrown solutions as well. So that will be a big focus.
00:25:24.200 - 00:25:50.886, Speaker B: For us in this year and also looking forward to decentralizing more and inviting more community members to start their own decentralized autonomous companies. So we can help with the funding for them. But we need people who actually can lead, can very motivated people and the ones who can dream and who can realize their dreams.
00:25:51.078 - 00:26:20.182, Speaker C: I'm also looking forward to seeing more of you guys building on Metis. Right? And I think that's why you came here. Some of you may be developers, some of you not. But community need all of you, right? It's not just about developers. It's about people who can market, who can manage communities, who can manage human resources. So every single role that exists in a web two world applicable to web3. Right.
00:26:20.182 - 00:27:02.834, Speaker C: And we need your talents. So I hope that all of you will join our ecosystem. We have very attractive tools for the ecosystem development. We are launching our grants program we have our Genesee investment fund supporting the promising projects which bring unique value to our ecosystem. We also have KCAs build your mining program that returns you a percentage of transaction fees that you spend on our network. And we have the community governance process. If you go through it, we will help you with marketing and other things.
00:27:02.834 - 00:27:09.410, Speaker C: So all these excited things we put together for you and looking forward to seeing you on Metis.
00:27:10.010 - 00:27:11.400, Speaker B: Thank you. Come over.
00:27:12.250 - 00:27:28.700, Speaker A: I think that's a great way to end it. Yeah. Thank you very much. Elena and Natalia. We do have the opportunity for maybe one or two burning questions. If they're out there, please raise your hand now and we can take that. And yeah, over here.
00:27:29.150 - 00:27:49.490, Speaker D: I know, like L2 right now is kind of in growth phase and kind of in your early stage, let's say X number of years from now, the TVL on the L2 becomes much, much bigger than Ethereum or just a much bigger ecosystem on L2. Do you think at that point the L2 just move on Ethereum and then become their own layer?
00:27:51.270 - 00:28:29.486, Speaker C: I think L2 will stay on top of Ethereum because if they move away from Ethereum, there no longer will be L2. Right. Because by definition, L2 relies on, it's built on top of the main chain or layer one. Right. So it relies on security and decentralization of the main layer while helping with the scaling. So if L2 moves away from the ethereum or from any other blockchain, then essentially they become in layer one. And we need to build our own consensus mechanism and our own infrastructure that ethereum already has.
00:28:29.486 - 00:28:34.290, Speaker C: So L2s cannot just move away and become independent chains.
00:28:35.110 - 00:28:39.700, Speaker B: Layer one is essential part of the L2. It has to be there.
00:28:41.430 - 00:28:56.120, Speaker A: Great question. Anybody else? Question back here. I remember reading in the roadmap about a sequencer pool. Is there a way for anybody to participate as a sequencer, like with their own node or their own validator or something like that?
00:28:56.570 - 00:29:13.040, Speaker B: Yes, because it will be decentralized. Yes. There will be opportunity for everyone to actually be the node, to hold the node. It's going to be based on the staking. So you have to stake a certain amount, but yes, so the sequencers will be decentralized in the community.
00:29:18.530 - 00:29:23.970, Speaker A: Any other questions? Quick follow up question. Do you know how much would need to be staked?
00:29:24.790 - 00:29:29.074, Speaker B: I don't think at this moment I know. Where's you on?
00:29:29.112 - 00:29:30.100, Speaker C: Where's you on?
00:29:31.510 - 00:29:35.330, Speaker B: I need our CTO. So probably read the announcements.
00:29:38.170 - 00:29:40.520, Speaker C: At the moment. It's an insider information.
00:29:42.810 - 00:30:00.930, Speaker A: Definitely. Any last questions? Take one more if it's out there, and. Great. Okay, so one last thing. I do want to give everyone a heads up. We have Smartcon September 20, eigth and 29th. I want to give a quick plug to that.
00:30:00.930 - 00:30:24.950, Speaker A: It is a conference that Chainlink Labs is putting on with an absolutely stacked panel. Mites will be there and many others. So if you're interested in that, feel free to come talk to me afterwards or talk to Jamie or anybody else and check that out. But without further ado, I'd like to give our guests a round of applause and say thank you for coming out.
00:30:25.720 - 00:30:26.444, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:30:26.482 - 00:30:26.970, Speaker C: Thank you, guys.
