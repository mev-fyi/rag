00:00:02.000 - 00:00:11.554, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Are you ready to this session number for today? I'm here with Bara. Hey, Bara, how are you?
00:00:12.054 - 00:00:14.514, Speaker B: Hi, Solange. I'm doing great. How are you doing?
00:00:15.214 - 00:00:19.514, Speaker A: So good. Exciting for this session. I really love to do this session.
00:00:19.934 - 00:00:50.374, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the last couple of days are, like, really exciting. People were like, look, creating smart contracts, deploying the first smart contract. I think we saw a lot of people, like, posting on Twitter and LinkedIn, sharing their experience. I think that's fantastic to see. And I think before we get started, let's see where people are joining from. I think we have a lot of people already. I can see Ajay, Deepak, there are a lot of people who are from the previous days joining us today.
00:00:50.374 - 00:00:55.634, Speaker B: Yeah. Guys, can you share with us, like, where you're joining from?
00:00:58.254 - 00:01:05.154, Speaker A: Yeah, if you'd like to share it here, because my question will depend today. So you can share it here now.
00:01:05.774 - 00:01:19.046, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, we have people from Pakistan, Canada. Great. Nigeria, Portugal, London. Yeah, great. I think we have people from all around the world. So I think it's really going to be a cross country session as well.
00:01:19.046 - 00:01:29.524, Speaker B: Like, you're going to speak to a lot of people who are going to learn more about cross chain protocols, especially the chaining CCIP today. Yeah, I think we can get started.
00:01:30.144 - 00:01:38.424, Speaker A: Yes. Let's go. So see you at the end. And Bara, you being the chat as well, to support you with the questions.
00:01:38.464 - 00:01:41.128, Speaker B: Okay, definitely, Solansha. See you soon.
00:01:41.176 - 00:01:41.520, Speaker C: Bye.
00:01:41.592 - 00:01:56.774, Speaker A: See you. So, let's go. I must share my screen with you. Let's prepare the right slides for you. Yes, here we are. Now, I'd like to add this to the end. Wait a minute, let me finish.
00:01:56.774 - 00:02:28.894, Speaker A: Only review where I'd like to have this information for you today. I have a lot of slides. You will see that you'll be huge. Yeah, I think now we are good. Let's share my screen with you. Here we are, session four present. And we are starting now.
00:02:28.894 - 00:03:09.174, Speaker A: Today is the session that you will learn about CCIP. And we are talking about the cross chain interoperability protocol. And we are doing a cross chain transfer. We are transferring a token from one blockchain to another blockchain. And I'm doing that using a token that I think is no it by some people because it's a stable coin. It's one of the representations of the USD in different blockchain. So this is the USDC.
00:03:09.174 - 00:03:30.562, Speaker A: Let's go. This is me. I think you already know me. I am a developer, advocate, I training clubs and based in Brazil. I am in Brazil now because I used to travel around the world, but I am in home now. And let's go to our pet and see what's happened over there. Yeah.
00:03:30.562 - 00:03:40.824, Speaker A: Remember that I saw some questions related to the previous sessions. We have all of them here in the Luma page.
00:03:41.484 - 00:03:42.424, Speaker C: Okay.
00:03:43.004 - 00:04:28.174, Speaker A: And also let's add more info for you as well. Remember that we have the bootcamp support in the discord. And you also can go to the YouTube to find the sessions if you need it, including different sessions. These are the slides that you can check it out later. Like I just updated this part that we are doing now. And remember that every day we have tasks. If you'd like to receive the tasks, to receive the certificate at the end, it's here to know the tasks.
00:04:28.174 - 00:04:38.022, Speaker A: And the people are already adding the name and country. But I have a different question to you. In a few minutes I will see your error.
00:04:38.078 - 00:04:40.582, Speaker C: Okay. Okay.
00:04:40.638 - 00:05:16.254, Speaker A: You are putting your name and country, but I'd like to know your favorite ice cream. Who is that? What's this? So I like. Okay, I'm from Brazil. Let's put Brazil for you. And I like chocolate. And you, what do you like? Yes, we already have a lot of people, a lot of questions. Amazing.
00:05:16.254 - 00:05:55.654, Speaker A: And let's add a bit more information here. Hey, yoga. Thank you. And I have more info for you. Yes, I know that we have some problems, some doubts, and in order to solve this in a like an organized way, I created this the debits for me. So all of you please go to the debits for me. So your questions that are here, add here in the debits form.
00:05:55.654 - 00:06:20.826, Speaker A: And we are checking this link. Or today or tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day that we have some surprises for you. But also we have time to solve it. Until now to have you like done to. Maybe if you need, you can study a bit more in the weekend. But we must be sure that you will be ready to the next week.
00:06:20.826 - 00:06:51.816, Speaker A: So go to the debit form. It's so simple for you. I can go over there where I am now. Is this only your email, your name? Like to answer the question exactly for you and your question. And we are helping you tomorrow. Okay, maybe today a bit, if I have time, but for sure tomorrow. And yes, we have a lot of names over there today I must talk a lot.
00:06:51.816 - 00:07:30.762, Speaker A: So let's go to the presentation because the content is huge today. Here we are. We are starting talking about interoperability. Oh, the pad. We should send the pad link because I forgot. Let's maintain the pad link a bit more here for you. And what is interoperability? And first of all, think about blockchain like islands.
00:07:30.762 - 00:08:22.044, Speaker A: Each blockchain is an isolated island and we must find ways to communicate between them. This is the concept of interoperability. So we are talking about the ability to exchange information between different systems or networks, in our case, different blockchains, even if they are incompatible. And the idea is to share concepts related to that when we talk about blockchain. Another concept that is important to you is the finality. So finality is the moment that we can say that your transaction is really immutable in a blockchain. And it depends on the blockchain, depends on the number of confirmations.
00:08:22.044 - 00:09:03.828, Speaker A: And is the moment that we used to say that the past transactions are extremely difficult or impossible to revert. This is the immutable part. So the finality varies across different networks. Some can have the instant finality, other needs multiple confirmations. And related to that, it means that we must have different times of confirmations. Maybe after the block, that is your transaction. To be sure, we would like to have 100 blocks after that.
00:09:03.828 - 00:09:30.034, Speaker A: And depends of the blockchain. Imagine that if we talk about Ethereum, 50 seconds per block, we are talking about a lot of seconds, okay. Like 15,000 seconds. Like that can be. Or it means that maybe we must wait 20 minutes or four minutes. Depends on the blockchain.
00:09:30.114 - 00:09:30.762, Speaker C: Okay?
00:09:30.898 - 00:10:21.924, Speaker A: But this is the concept of finality. And why you must understand this, because in blockchain, the interoperability depends of on the finality. To be sure that you can do some transaction in a destination blockchain, you must be sure that the transaction in the searcy blockchain will not revert, will not be changed. It's really immutable, okay. And for the people that needs the farm with the debts like this farm, it's in the pad, okay. If you go in the beginning of the bed, the pad, you can see my presentation, you can see the. For me, it's all over there, okay.
00:10:21.924 - 00:11:19.228, Speaker A: And yes, Matt, I need a break in the weekend and probably you as well, but maybe you'd like to use the break to study a bit more, to be ready to the next week. I really need the break to rest a bit, okay. Especially because. Or I'm teaching, or I am like supporting all the sessions in three languages, 6 hours per day. Today I'm teaching the 6 hours because I'm doing this session in Portuguese, English and Spanish. And like I said before, blockchain, it's an isolated network and they cannot communicate in a natively way. So what you must have between the blockchains, the first concept that exists are the bridge.
00:11:19.228 - 00:12:16.062, Speaker A: So the bridge is a way to communicate from one blockchain to another blockchain. But we used to say that the traditional bridges are centralized. It means that when you are transferring the funds from one chain to another chain using a bridge, in fact you are giving the funds to some centralized identity and you must trust that they will send your tokens to the other chain. And if you do some search related to last year, to past hacks and bridge, especially last year, it happened a lot. So it's really hard to have a centralized bridge to trust in a centralized bridge when you are transferring funds.
00:12:16.158 - 00:12:16.954, Speaker C: Okay.
00:12:18.814 - 00:13:25.190, Speaker A: And to solve this we have the CCIP, the chainlink cross chain interoperability protocol. And what is the CCIP? The CCIP connects, the blockchain connects different blockchains networks using lanes. And the lane is a unique combination of the searcy blockchain and the destination blockchain. And you can say that lane is going from a to c but we have another lane go into c, two a. And also another concept that is important to you is the chain selector. So each of these blockchains has a selector, it's a code like it's a number that you must use this selector to communicate with that blockchain. Here we have a high level architecture of the CCIP.
00:13:25.190 - 00:14:01.930, Speaker A: It's a huge view for you. So imagine that you are here, the end user in the circ blockchain. You are interacting with some application, decentralized application and over there you have some messages. And in a minute we will understand better what's the message. But it's been defined, the message and the destination blockchain. So I'd like to send some transaction to which blockchain. This is the point.
00:14:01.930 - 00:14:32.590, Speaker A: All of this is done in the searcy blockchain and we have a halter over there. So the communication between ER is much content. So imagine that this is match content inside the surface blockchain. This is much content. We communicate with the outer. The outer is another, is much content in the circe blockchain. Then we came into the off chain part.
00:14:32.590 - 00:15:15.434, Speaker A: This is CCIp part that's off chain. And here you can see that a message can be some information and also can be tokens. This is going to a destination blockchain. So in the destination blockchain I already know that the message came to this destination blockchain that was defined here. When I'm sending the transaction in the search. I came here, I arrived here in the destination blockchain and we have a how that over there as well. So we have a how to in each blockchain that chainlink CCIP is implemented.
00:15:15.434 - 00:16:47.822, Speaker A: Now the outer sends the message to some application that is prepared to receive this message, or even if it's a token can be sent directly to the end user. We are doing this today because we are transferring USDC, we are creating this application in this searcy blockchain and we are sending directly to the user wallet in the destination blockchain. So let's understand better the concepts that we have here because this will be used today and next week you have another session related to CCIP. What is a cross chain messaging? Cross chain message can be used to transfer tokens and these tokens must be already implemented, supported by chaining CCIP. A cross message can be to send any kind of data, information or even you can send the token and some info, some instructors instruction. What would you like to do with that token? And remember that you saw that we have the CCIP sender. The CCIp sender can be you directly.
00:16:47.822 - 00:17:42.794, Speaker A: The concept of your account in your wallet, it's a e o, a external owned account or can be any smart contract. Like today you are creating a smart contract to do that. Also we can have the CCIP receiver. The receiver can be external owned account as well. But if you are sending tokens can be that. But if you are sending a message with the token or only a message, it must be a smart contact that implements that ccipreceiver. So with the instructors on what you do when you receive a message, I'd like to answer a bit of this question.
00:17:42.794 - 00:17:51.538, Speaker A: I can tell you that CCIP can work like a bridge, but CCIP is more than average.
00:17:51.626 - 00:17:52.178, Speaker C: Okay.
00:17:52.266 - 00:18:20.904, Speaker A: And you will understand this better in a few minutes. Okay. You saw the outer in a previous slide. So the howter. It's a contract that is responsible for initiating the cross chain interactions. And we have one how contract per chain. I must update this, sorry.
00:18:20.904 - 00:19:14.378, Speaker A: Here. Okay. And how the outer works when you are transferring tokens, the colors must approve with the how to be able to spend to transfer tokens. So this is a concept of ERC 20 token that we must understand better today. Like yesterday you saw the ERC 20 token. But when you are transferring tokens, for example, choice March contact is not the same like Ethereum. When you receive the smart contract has the ability to know when receive Ethereum or the native token because that receive function that we saw yesterday.
00:19:14.378 - 00:20:08.210, Speaker A: But if you send tokens to as much content as much content doesn't know that received a token. So we used to do another approach on that. The approach is to approve that smart contract to use your token and then call another function called transfer from inside the match content. So days match content will be able to get the tokens from your account. We are doing this now in a few minutes in the hands on part. Okay, come back to the outer, the outer as well. When a message is received on the destination chain, the router is the company that delivers the tokens and the message to the user account.
00:20:08.362 - 00:20:09.174, Speaker C: Okay.
00:20:12.994 - 00:21:01.278, Speaker A: So what can I do with CCIp? What are the core capabilities of CCIP? First of all, token transfer. We are doing this today. This is the ability to transfer ERC 20 tokens. Another is send any arbitrary message like hello world from one chain to another chain. And the measure that we can combine this and create a programmable token transfer. You send the token to the destination blockchain. When the token arrived over there, you'd like to add in a protocol two links, or you'd like to do a stake or you'd like to do a swap to another with another token.
00:21:01.278 - 00:21:48.792, Speaker A: You can do whatever you'd like to do when the token arrives. And this will be automatically programmable. It will be defined in the destination contract and related to the arbitrary messaging. Next week, the other session related to CCIP. You will learn how to mint a token from one blockchain in another blockchain. So this is an overview what you have related to CCIP. What is the cross chain stack? So we must have your wallets and applications that are cross chain interesting projects to doing the hackathon.
00:21:48.792 - 00:22:38.366, Speaker A: Also you can use the cross chain concepts inside DeFi or NFTs or gaming. Like I said before, next week you are learning how to do this with an NFT. But also imagine a game that you can use an asset from one chain to another chain. Or let's go from outside the blockchain. Imagine that you, you have Nintendo and Xbox and you'd like to use some game or some resources that there are in a game in the Nintendo. You really would like to use that in the Xbox version. How can you do that? You must have a CCIP between the systems.
00:22:38.366 - 00:22:56.548, Speaker A: But this is not, this is not blockchain. So imagine the same on blockchain. If you'd like to use some asset from one game in one blockchain, you'd like to use that asset in another blockchain. In another game or the same game doesn't matter.
00:22:56.676 - 00:22:57.464, Speaker C: Okay.
00:22:58.724 - 00:23:57.464, Speaker A: The CCIP and the cross chain stack is so important when you think about the enterprise and capital markets. Imagine that and you can see later, maybe do some research related to the PoC that was done with Swift that interact with all the banks. And we have another example with a bank or another system in New Zealand. So there are interesting approaches to you related to enterprise and capital markets. We already talked about the program token transfers. You know that you can use the CCIP in a way that it's only a bridge across chain bridge. You can have any kind of cross chain decentralized applications, all of these using the CCIP.
00:23:57.464 - 00:24:56.304, Speaker A: And I tell a bit more related to the risk management network because I saw some people in the chat exactly asking about the difference between other bridges or other protocols. And I can tell you that it's exactly the risky management network that makes the difference. But let's talk about this a bit later. For now, let's see some examples what cross chain experience developers can build using the CCIP. We already talked about the token transfers, but imagine in DeFi that you can have the collateral in one blockchain and lock this collateral in one blockchain and borrow something in another blockchain. This can be possible now. So easy.
00:24:56.304 - 00:24:59.404, Speaker A: And when we talk about DeFi.
00:25:02.504 - 00:25:02.792, Speaker C: We.
00:25:02.808 - 00:26:02.330, Speaker A: Used to say about Monet, Lagos, or about the composability, but it was a composability inside the blockchain. Now you can have the true DeFi composability between blockchains with different parts interacting in different blockchains related to nfts. I already gave some ideas to you. Another interesting point. Did you hear about account abstraction? I think this is a good concept to you to learn later when we finish the bootcamp. Account abstraction is a new concept where we can have some wallets that's kind of smart contracts and can be better to recover because it's can have a different approach in recovering the wallet and the funds. And this account abstraction can be done between blockchains as well.
00:26:02.330 - 00:26:58.004, Speaker A: You can have the cross chain account abstraction. I already talked about games with you and related to data storage and computation. We know that some blockchains are more expensive than another blockchain. So what about to save or to store a part of the information in a shipper blockchain and have only the hash, only the final result in another blockchain. Like we know that Ethereum started before the others and it's like the base. So you already have your application in Ethereum since the beginning, but now we have a lot of layers too, that are more, that are faster, are less expensive. So let's do more storage on that.
00:26:58.004 - 00:27:32.564, Speaker A: Let's do more complicated computations on that layer two and bring the final result to Ethereum. This can be so easy now. And remember that I told you about the risk management network. It's here. Let's understand this a bit more. So you are here, you are the end user, you are interacting with your sender contract in the searcy blockchain. They sender contract, you interact, communicate with the outer.
00:27:32.564 - 00:28:23.914, Speaker A: And if you have tokens, we have tokens today. So I can explain this part a bit more. But you can see that the risk management network is interacting on this part. Like we have a decentralized network here only to take care of the risks, only to guarantee the security of this part also, we have another decentralized network of the risk management here also to be sure that we don't have a double spent, we don't have nothing wrong in the transaction. And you can see here that I have different networks. In fact, this is the off chain part. It was not only one decentralized network.
00:28:23.914 - 00:29:01.874, Speaker A: You know that if you have a decentralized network, it's more secure. But imagine if you have three decentralized networks. This is really, really secure because we have one network that is monitoring everything that's happened. We have another network. This is the committing zone that proposed receive the transaction in the searcy blockchain. Proposes the transaction in the destination blockchain. This will be in the commit store and they must have a consensus in order to do that.
00:29:01.874 - 00:29:52.960, Speaker A: So they propose some transaction in the destination blockchain only after the risk management network approved. We have a third network here. The executing done that will really execute that transaction here, send the transaction to the outer. And again, we have this on rank part. If you have tokens, off rank part in the other side. Let's understand this a bit late, okay? I have more things related to this. When I talk about payments, how can I pay the fees here? Let's come back here again like, okay, I'm sending a transaction in the destination blockchain.
00:29:52.960 - 00:30:42.980, Speaker A: It means that I'm paying fees in the destination blockchain, the gas fees that you already know about that, but I pay this in the searcy blockchain. How I can do that? The outer can calculate that fees for me. So the outer, you have the ability, the capability to calculate fees on the destination blockchain. When I mean farming the destination blockchain. It will calculate the fees. And this is how can I pay the fees? You already know that you are paying the fees in the searcy blockchain. What are the fees? The fees are the gas cost to do both transaction and destination blockchain.
00:30:42.980 - 00:31:01.282, Speaker A: And we are paying a bit more like a premium than that. Be rewarded to the decentralized oracle networks. That three networks. And you can pay the fees using the token link or using the nativity token from the searcy blockchain.
00:31:01.418 - 00:31:02.214, Speaker C: Okay.
00:31:03.594 - 00:32:03.528, Speaker A: And if the fees change a bit in the search, we are like monitoring this and you have reliable execution in the destination blockchain. So this is the other part of the risk management network that I'd like to show you. So what is doing the risk management network? It's looking for all kind of problems. Repeated messages, incorrect amounts, no matching cross chain messages. Like you have a transaction here that's not over there or someone try to bring this part and create a transaction in the destination chain without having the searcy blockchain and something like that. All kind of problems. We are being sure that this will not happen here.
00:32:03.616 - 00:32:04.404, Speaker C: Okay.
00:32:05.304 - 00:32:56.364, Speaker A: And yes, this is of it's offline part that's monitoring how the online part as well. And about that you have the presentation and you have this to see a bit more related to the risk management network. I can stay old session only to talk about that. So I not do this today. We must go to the hands on part. And this is, this is the hand zone part. So today you are using the chaining CCIP to transfer USDC between blockchains.
00:32:56.364 - 00:33:17.280, Speaker A: And also this is a base kit transfer. So I did this really, really easy for beginners. But if you'd like to see more advanced ideas, advanced options, you have this git book and this YouTube masterclass.
00:33:17.392 - 00:33:18.164, Speaker C: Okay.
00:33:19.984 - 00:33:39.994, Speaker A: Let'S go. We are doing our transfer from avalanche Fuji to a cheroom sepolia. So we have a lot of things to configure today. Let's do that. So we are here. Let's update my pad and come back to the end.
00:33:40.294 - 00:33:41.234, Speaker C: Okay.
00:33:42.014 - 00:33:46.982, Speaker A: I didn't forgot you, but let's see if you have time at the end to see your rehearsal.
00:33:46.998 - 00:33:47.714, Speaker C: Okay.
00:33:52.094 - 00:33:53.990, Speaker A: But I know what's your reholt here.
00:33:54.022 - 00:33:54.694, Speaker C: Okay.
00:33:54.854 - 00:34:06.022, Speaker A: The problem probably you didn't did the grain roll part in the token. So check it out. The grain roll part.
00:34:06.078 - 00:34:06.462, Speaker C: Okay.
00:34:06.518 - 00:34:33.014, Speaker A: To solve your problem. So I have on my other screen everything that you need for now. Today we are using the link token. So let's use it here is the link token. And we must add the link to metamask. So let's go here. Click on that.
00:34:33.014 - 00:34:59.622, Speaker A: And I have the address of the link token now of the network. I know that he did this with you in the first session. But let's be sure that everyone can do that now again in a peaceful way. So I am here. I can choose the network that I'd like to have it. I am else Polya and I will do the edge to wallet part. Let's see what's my.
00:34:59.622 - 00:35:26.978, Speaker A: Is my wallet good? Yes, I am in sepon. Everything's good. So edge to wallet link. And I don't have any link here. It's fine. I hope you to do the same. And here is the reference without the address for you.
00:35:26.978 - 00:35:48.324, Speaker A: Okay, next step. You saw that I'm going from avalanche Fuji to ethereum seporia. Avalanche is another network Fuji. It's another blockchain. Fuji is the testnet from avalish. Okay, we must configure the avalanche Fuji. Let's do that.
00:35:48.324 - 00:36:13.594, Speaker A: Now the setup. Remember that we have this. In order to add the Fujitu metamask. I go here. Chain list. It's amazing website where you can get the configurations of different networks. So here.
00:36:13.594 - 00:36:21.390, Speaker A: Hey, demos. The presentation link is in the beginning.
00:36:21.462 - 00:36:21.950, Speaker C: Okay.
00:36:22.022 - 00:36:24.430, Speaker A: Slides. You can get the links over there.
00:36:24.462 - 00:36:25.154, Speaker C: Okay.
00:36:28.454 - 00:36:49.564, Speaker A: No, not that. Okay. So with this chainlist.org dot I already choose the network that we need. This is the avalanche Fuji. How can I add this to my metamask? I'm going. First of all, connect my wallet.
00:36:49.564 - 00:37:18.184, Speaker A: Next connect. I'm connected now. And now I can add it to metamask. Hey, Elena, I may just teach you how you do that. Okay, go to the pad. It's only to click here. Line 202.
00:37:18.184 - 00:37:46.320, Speaker A: And I have this on my. I was here. I clicked in add to metamask and banana. We are is better if they go directly to this now. Okay. Because this is the Fuji network directly. And probably I didn't yet.
00:37:46.320 - 00:38:12.906, Speaker A: Yes, here chainlists are asking to allow this to add this network. Let's approve that. And then I'm switching from Sepolia to avalanche Fuji. Now you can see that I am on avalanche Fuji. Let's see. Over there.
00:38:13.050 - 00:38:13.734, Speaker C: Here.
00:38:14.354 - 00:38:37.394, Speaker A: So hino mainnet. Avalanche Fuji testnet. I'm here now. Next point. I know that we must fund our vault. But before that, let's add the link token here as well. So it's connected on push.
00:38:37.394 - 00:39:25.696, Speaker A: I'm going again to the chaining documentation. And yesterday I did a comment in the portuguese session that's important to do to you as well. When we think about token addresses, you must be sure that you are really going to the official documentation to get an address. Why that? Can you create a link token just now? We did yesterday. Yes, we can have a lot of tokens with the name link but they are not official. Be careful to not be scammed. To not interact with a token that supposed to be linked.
00:39:25.696 - 00:39:56.940, Speaker A: But it's not the way to be sure of that is go to the official documentation. If you would like to interact with any token in the blockchain, go to the official documentation. Would like to interact with USDC go to the circle documentation. We are doing that today. You'd like to interact with Uniswap, go to the Uniswap documentation. Be sure that you are going to the right place to get the address of a token. Okay.
00:39:56.940 - 00:40:26.374, Speaker A: This is so important to you to not have problems, to not disclose. Okay. So I came here. I am in wavelength Fuji now and also I'd like to add the link token on avalanche Fuji. We have here the edituality. It's so easy. So edit token.
00:40:26.374 - 00:40:53.558, Speaker A: I don't have a link as well. No problem. And we what's happening now? If I came here on Metamask and I go to the tokens part, you can see that I have a bit of a vax and zero link. But these are the tokens that I should have. Now this is the beginning of the setup part so let's close this and this and this.
00:40:53.726 - 00:40:54.554, Speaker C: Okay.
00:40:56.374 - 00:41:20.372, Speaker A: Now next we must have tokens. I know that you don't have tokens on Avax. And let's go over there. Let's go to the file set. Probably we don't have in the faucet yet. Okay. Nothing.
00:41:20.372 - 00:41:48.580, Speaker A: Wait a minute. That I will fund the faucet. Now I have it using another account and I'm doing that in another account. So I am in the other screen that you are not seeing that changing my account. And then how many people do you have here? Now let's see. So 190. Let's think 200.
00:41:48.580 - 00:42:19.694, Speaker A: Are you at? In order to get 0.5 I 100 link. 100 avax. And also let's see how much I have on link. I must add the link here as well. Let's do the process again here. And I changed my wallet in the other screen.
00:42:19.694 - 00:42:21.134, Speaker A: You cannot see that but I change.
00:42:21.174 - 00:42:21.754, Speaker C: It.
00:42:25.474 - 00:42:28.170, Speaker A: And I'm authorizing that in another screen.
00:42:28.202 - 00:42:28.934, Speaker C: Okay.
00:42:32.634 - 00:42:33.938, Speaker A: Yeah, I have enough.
00:42:34.106 - 00:42:36.574, Speaker C: It's good. So good.
00:42:36.994 - 00:42:50.856, Speaker A: So let's do that. First of all, I'm getting the address of the file set and I am in the other screen. Saint some Avax. Wait, I send everything. Then you start to get it.
00:42:50.880 - 00:42:51.464, Speaker C: Okay.
00:42:51.584 - 00:43:12.644, Speaker A: And I know that some of you need the faucet password. Wait a bit more. Let's do this first. So I just sent the Avax. You didn't see that? It's not a problem. I know that I'm doing that. Another screen.
00:43:12.644 - 00:43:15.164, Speaker A: I'm sending link now.
00:43:23.114 - 00:43:24.094, Speaker C: Okay.
00:43:26.914 - 00:43:51.274, Speaker A: And doing the transactions is confirmed. Let's see what's happened here. Yoo hoo. Now you can start to get it. And if you don't have the password, let's add over there. I must come back to my other account and including I need that. So let's add the password to file set if you need it.
00:43:51.274 - 00:44:21.954, Speaker A: So be sure. I know that this is a new network for you. So I may expecting you to come here like you do now. Copy the address of your metamask wallet. Paste here. Probably you need Avax and link. So send the request.
00:44:21.954 - 00:44:59.182, Speaker A: And in a few minutes you have ten testnet link and 0.5 avax. These are the transactions and I can close that. But if you are seeing this session in another moment, not live with us, probably you need to find this in another way. And this can happen because we have 200 people doing this in the same time. It doesn't matter. Okay, so if you are not live, go to the official faucet.
00:44:59.182 - 00:45:05.264, Speaker A: Not now, because probably we broke the faucet. But use the workshop faucet now.
00:45:05.304 - 00:45:05.856, Speaker C: Okay.
00:45:05.960 - 00:45:21.656, Speaker A: If you don't have it here, go to the other. I have another faucet from avalanche as well. I don't know that's working. Yeah, this is another interesting faucet that can help you.
00:45:21.680 - 00:45:22.364, Speaker C: Okay.
00:45:26.184 - 00:45:41.948, Speaker A: And because we are in a different network, it's interesting to you that the ether scale on Ethereum is for avalanche. Is there snow trace? This is the block explorer that we are using.
00:45:42.116 - 00:45:42.944, Speaker C: Okay.
00:45:45.684 - 00:46:28.874, Speaker A: So let's go to the USD part. How are you? I'm not seeing. Yeah, guys, don't worry. If you got an EHR over there, he fresh the page and try again. Like I used to say that I broke all the systems because and not only I'm doing that, but when our first, the chaining team, when we do a bootcamp like that. This is the huge block bootcamp in the blockchain space. And I think the concepts and the systems are not prepared to us.
00:46:28.874 - 00:47:07.344, Speaker A: So it's normal that we are breaking all the systems, but they will come back. So next step, let's go to the USD part. I must import the USD part in my metamask wallet as well. So come here. Remember that I told you that I must go to the official site. Who is the owner who created the USDC? It's circle. So I'm going to come back.
00:47:07.344 - 00:47:18.092, Speaker A: Yes, come back here. So let's go to the stable coins on the circle documentation and make it just bigger for you.
00:47:18.268 - 00:47:18.652, Speaker C: Better.
00:47:18.708 - 00:47:35.080, Speaker A: Now we have the USDC on test networks. Here you are. And we have the address in different networks. So now we are on avalanche. Fuji. This is the address that we need.
00:47:35.192 - 00:47:36.004, Speaker C: Okay.
00:47:38.424 - 00:48:07.364, Speaker A: So let's add this in the faucet first. In the metamask first here. In order to add this to metamask, this I must do in a manual way. So copy the address. This is the address that you saw here. Km two metamask tokens. Import tokens.
00:48:07.364 - 00:48:31.100, Speaker A: Paste the USDC address. It's here. It's right. And next. Okay, now I have the token over there as well. Next step is the file set. Remember that we add on Fuji.
00:48:31.172 - 00:48:31.944, Speaker C: Okay.
00:48:33.964 - 00:49:01.814, Speaker A: The file sets. It's a different file set. Let's see if you are broking the circle faucet now. You need more link. Oh guys. What you are doing? Okay, and someone take off the password. Okay, I'm adding the password here again.
00:49:01.814 - 00:49:04.258, Speaker A: And let's see if you need more.
00:49:04.346 - 00:49:06.734, Speaker C: What I did here.
00:49:08.474 - 00:49:10.614, Speaker A: Get the password.
00:49:11.354 - 00:49:11.778, Speaker C: Oh.
00:49:11.826 - 00:49:49.094, Speaker A: What is the faucet? Guys? Okay, let's see what it is with the faucet. Five. Okay. Are you saying a bit more? Wait a minute. Exactly. Saint. I first I'm funding the official faucet.
00:49:49.094 - 00:50:09.026, Speaker A: Okay, wait a bit more. Oh how I. Oh, I am in the wrong. Wait. I did things wrong. Now go to the official account now.
00:50:09.090 - 00:50:09.734, Speaker C: Yes.
00:50:12.074 - 00:50:28.326, Speaker A: Wait a minute. I may funding this now. But I'm doing the other screen. I think this will be enough for now. How you got out the link?
00:50:28.390 - 00:50:28.994, Speaker C: Guys?
00:50:32.494 - 00:51:02.586, Speaker A: In some seconds we have that. Let's try this now. So this is done and let's go to the to the official USDc file set. If this is not working, probably we must try late. In another moment. Remember that I'm not only cheering sepolia. So come back.
00:51:02.586 - 00:51:20.014, Speaker A: The network. Change the network to avalanche. Fuji. Let's try. I don't know if it is working now. PRobabLY you broken the faucet before me. Oh wow.
00:51:20.014 - 00:51:47.596, Speaker A: Yeah. This is a problem to us. I think I have something in another way. Or maybe I change the workshop. We will do different workshops. Let's see if I have in my other account at least to. To help myself to do this with you.
00:51:47.596 - 00:52:23.416, Speaker A: And probably you must do it later. This will be a problem without the workshops that I have today. Guys, I must change all the workshops. So let's see if I have. I don't know, wait a bit more that I'm solving the problem. What I must do, I must add the link token in my other account. Yeah, it's so send.
00:52:23.416 - 00:52:51.828, Speaker A: Jeez, guys, I am in another account now. Okay? You know that I'm rich on this account. Oh, I have 20 here. I can do that. But I'm sorry, guys, you cannot do with me. Oh, it's so sad. Okay, but I may do it in my other account.
00:52:51.828 - 00:53:28.304, Speaker A: Not on this, let's say, at least for me. So I'm sending YSDC for myself in the account that I'm using the workshop, okay? Only to do this with you. And I try to solve this to the other sessions or late. Let's talk with someone else to solve this. But I cannot solve live. Okay, so here we are. We know that.
00:53:28.304 - 00:53:54.992, Speaker A: Let's try to solve it later. I will try to do two workshops with you. Okay, when is this? Then we try another workshop. Let's try to do both. Maybe you use a bit more. So next step, let's finish this and then I will do another. Another workshop.
00:53:54.992 - 00:54:21.484, Speaker A: If you transferring another token. Okay, first of all, a bit more to you related to SDC. Let's go to the remix part now. Yes, Filipi, are you throughout the process with the USDC. Then we are changing to do that with another token.
00:54:24.464 - 00:54:27.644, Speaker C: Okay, it's here.
00:54:29.104 - 00:54:51.644, Speaker A: So remember that. Let's go to remix and see if I am in the right network. Icon number five. I mean remix. Change the environment. Injected provider. Hey, the people are telling that the faucet is working again.
00:54:51.644 - 00:54:52.836, Speaker A: Try over there.
00:54:52.980 - 00:55:01.420, Speaker C: Go, go, go. Yahoo.
00:55:01.572 - 00:55:19.924, Speaker A: The faucet is working. Here we are. I just connect my wallet with remix again. And this is a different network. The four 3113. And I must send this contact to you.
00:55:21.264 - 00:55:22.004, Speaker C: This.
00:55:22.304 - 00:55:58.404, Speaker A: Okay, so now we are creating a file called transfer USDC Basic. Here we have transfer USDC basic. Let's copy and paste the code for you. Here we are. Don't cut the code, only copy it. Be nice if you are friends. And remember to create a new file, go to the second icon.
00:55:58.404 - 00:56:27.984, Speaker A: File explorer. Go down the workspace in the button, create a new file or right button. Create a new file in some place here. Transfer USDC basic. I already have you one, so it's change the number here. Come back here. Come on guys, come back.
00:56:27.984 - 00:56:36.304, Speaker A: Ctrl Z, put the code back here. Go, go, go. Okay, yeah, you do that.
00:56:40.924 - 00:56:41.644, Speaker C: Here.
00:56:41.804 - 00:58:02.594, Speaker A: Okay. And we are updating our official GitHub for you. This is from the past bootcamp. Okay, the bootcamp that we did in January, we have. It is late here, but if, if the people cut the code again, get it here, okay, until the end of the bootcamp, we have official on the chain link GitHub. Okay, here we are, here is the code and let's you can deploy that, but I must explain a lot of things to you, okay, and when we deploy it, add here the information for me. Let's deploy, click on deploy, confirm, waiting be confirmed.
00:58:02.594 - 00:58:47.794, Speaker A: Here we are. I'd like to ping that, copy the address and share with you now. Where is the people here ehor online. Oh, again, I can't believe that someone did this again. Be sure that you copy and paste from here or get on GitHub when it starts to be complicated, get on GitHub. Okay, this should compile. Or if you came here and click on copy raw file, it's the same.
00:59:23.114 - 00:59:26.666, Speaker B: Solange, sorry to interrupt, but I think you are on mute.
00:59:26.770 - 01:00:07.542, Speaker A: Yes, I forgot. Okay, thank you, bara. So what I have here, I have the license, the version of solidity. Remember that we are deploying this on Fuji. And now this is the ccip part. So what I have here, first I have the interface out there. It means that this is the interface to interact with the outer, okay, then I have the client, the client from CCIP.
01:00:07.542 - 01:01:03.430, Speaker A: It's much content that has some structures, some definitions that we used to have inside our content. Because I'm interacting with an ERC 20 token, I'm getting from open zeppelin, the interface for the ERC 20 token. And because I do a transfer from the USDC token from one account to another account, I'm using the safe ERC 20 from the open zeppelin as well. Five. Jonah, I don't have another way. Now maybe if you wait a bit, you can try again like the people told us that you can try late.
01:01:03.502 - 01:01:04.234, Speaker C: Okay.
01:01:06.894 - 01:01:48.158, Speaker A: And this is, this is my content. I'm using the safe ERC 20 for the interface, for the token, the USD token, USDC token. And here is new for you guys. We didn't use that before. This is a way that you can handle with the ehors in your smart content. And what kind of ehors I may try to solve, or at least to send a nice message. First, I'd like to know if I don't have enough balance to pay the fees we are paying the fees using the link token.
01:01:48.246 - 01:01:49.034, Speaker C: Okay.
01:01:51.094 - 01:02:33.026, Speaker A: So this is the way that I can check that. Like what's my link balance and how much I must have to pay the fees I'm sending USDC. So I'd like to be sure that I, I have enough balance on my account to do this transfer. And by the way, here I must send a link to the contract. This is the first way that you are using the token link. And the purpose to the token link is exactly to pay fees to be used in some chaining services. Okay, this is the USDC.
01:02:33.026 - 01:03:17.410, Speaker A: So in your wallet you must have an amount more than you'd like to transfer. And because I use send the link token to my contract at the end, if I like to withdraw the tokens and I don't have enough, I can receive this. Ehr, okay, this you already know about that. The owner is the person who is creating the content. You can see that I have the interface with the router. I have the interface with the link token. I have the interface with the USDC token here.
01:03:17.410 - 01:03:57.254, Speaker A: I have a lot of things hard coded, but you can know exactly where I got each information. So what is the outer? Let's go over there and see the outer. Okay, here is the CCIP documentation. And by the way, talking about the documentation, you can go to the overview. You can see how to get started. But I'm hearing the supported network space. You can see all the networks that CCIP is deployed now.
01:03:57.254 - 01:04:17.050, Speaker A: And I am on Fuji. So this is Fuji. And remember that for each network we have a smart content. That's the outer. Here is the outer. Also these are chain selector that I can use. Now I'm using the outer.
01:04:17.050 - 01:04:46.734, Speaker A: Okay, this is the outer finishing 8177. Let's see, 8177 is this. Okay, I must have the link address. You already got it in the link contracts over there. But also if I am in the CCIP page, I can get the same address from here. 7846. 7846 is this.
01:04:46.734 - 01:05:38.724, Speaker A: And I'm doing the transfer of the USDC token. So this is the address of USDC we already got from here. And I'm sending from avalanche Fuji to escrim sepoya. So it means that the chain selector, you be that where I got that in the support network space. I can go to. Where is Sepoya here? I can go to Sepolia Sepoya and get the chain selector over there. Okay, this is the same that I have here.
01:05:38.724 - 01:06:17.090, Speaker A: So I'd like to create an event. Remember that events are locks that are sending outside the blockchain. And I'd like to know when I'm transferring USDC across chain. This is the idea of the message for which chain. The address, who you received that the amount and how much I'm paying on fees. The constructor is the UB runner. When we are deploying the content, we are initializing everything.
01:06:17.090 - 01:06:43.758, Speaker A: This is the owner, the CCIP outer, the link token, the USDC token. Then this is the main function that we have it. The transfer USDC it to Sepolia. I must pass the parameters. Who will you receive? Our goal is to send it to our own account but in the other blockchain on Sepolia and how much I'd like to send.
01:06:43.886 - 01:06:44.674, Speaker C: Okay.
01:06:46.734 - 01:07:20.310, Speaker A: Here. Remember that I told you that I'm importing the client of CCIP to get some structures, some definition that we have over there. This is one of that. I have a special type called EVM token amount. This is an array and I'm creating this array now covered token amounts. And I can transfer more than one token. We are only transferred one now.
01:07:20.310 - 01:07:31.230, Speaker A: Okay, what token are you transferring? It's the USDC. The amount is the amount that I need to find here.
01:07:31.382 - 01:07:32.234, Speaker C: Okay.
01:07:36.574 - 01:08:18.350, Speaker A: So interesting question over there. In fact, you can have the address because avalanche Fuji, it's EVM compatible. You can have the same address on Ethereum, on Sepolia and Fuji. So if you'd like to send from one account, from the account one to the account two. Yes, you can be sure that you have the setup correctly. But we are starting on avalanche Fuji, not Sepoya. We are going from Fuji to Sepoya.
01:08:18.382 - 01:08:18.998, Speaker C: Okay.
01:08:19.126 - 01:08:55.930, Speaker A: The source is Fuji. And here we are. I have another structure defined in the CCIP client. This is the EVM to any messaging is the message that I'm creating now. So the receiver, it's my account that I'd like to receive the amount of tokens. I don't have any date and information over there because I'm only sending tokens. These are the token amounts.
01:08:55.930 - 01:09:23.314, Speaker A: This structure that we create upstairs. And I don't have any extra arguments. For example, when I'm doing the CCIP nft that you are doing that next week, I mean increasing the gas limit. But for now I don't need to do nothing. And how I'm paying the fees. I'm paying using the token link.
01:09:23.474 - 01:09:24.334, Speaker C: Okay.
01:09:28.114 - 01:09:51.054, Speaker A: No, you don't. The can you transfer to account that is not yours. Yes you can. You can transfer to anyway. But it's easy to you to understand here I'm doing the most basic thing I'm doing the most that way. So I prefer to transfer to my own account in the other blockchain.
01:09:51.174 - 01:09:51.954, Speaker C: Okay.
01:09:54.614 - 01:10:16.884, Speaker A: And here I'm calculating the fees. Remember that I told you that the outer can do that for me. We have this function called get fee and the feed depends of the destination blockchain. Like some blockchains are more expensive than others and depends on the size of my message.
01:10:17.224 - 01:10:18.084, Speaker C: Okay.
01:10:21.144 - 01:10:55.328, Speaker A: Here I'm checking if the fee that I must pay is higher than the amount of link that I have on my contract. And if I don't have enough to pay the fees, I will revert with the error. Or if you are good, I'm approving. Remember that concept of approv transfer from? It's here. I'm approving the outer to use to transfer from my smart contract the amount of fees that I need.
01:10:55.456 - 01:10:56.284, Speaker C: Okay.
01:10:58.664 - 01:11:11.684, Speaker A: In the same way I'd like to send like 0.1 USDC. I'd like to be sure that I have enough USDC, not on the conflict but on my account.
01:11:11.984 - 01:11:12.844, Speaker C: Okay.
01:11:13.344 - 01:11:36.076, Speaker A: If not, I will have virtuous. If I have it, I will transfer from my account to the smart contract. And then I'm approving the author to expand my USDC tokens.
01:11:36.180 - 01:11:37.024, Speaker C: Okay.
01:11:39.844 - 01:12:23.372, Speaker A: After I'll define it, I can use the CCIP send in the outer to send that message to the destination chain selector. Each message that you sent, you have a unique message id and then I'm emitting the event. Okay, let's see if I need to add more in the faucet. Oh, enough. And for both guys, you are getting so much. Get only what you need, please. Okay, I do a small break to send more tokens to the faucet again.
01:12:23.372 - 01:13:07.156, Speaker A: Wait a minute. And why am I sending like this a few per time? Because I must have enough to order three classes. And also we are trying to avoid just to have some bot or someone getting more than we need. Okay, this is so important to have the right in the class. So I'm sending tokens in the other screen. Let's send it to. Do you have more people now? I still.
01:13:07.156 - 01:13:54.752, Speaker A: I don't have more people. I sure that someone is getting more than you need. Be nice if you are friend guys. So sending a bit more of alpha wax. Let's send a bit more of link as well. It seems that Gabrielle got it. Okay, but I have a bit more over there.
01:13:54.752 - 01:14:24.640, Speaker A: Let's change my account one more time. Okay, let's go forward. Come back here to the content. This is something that I create only to help you to help the students during the workshops. I'd like to see if my content is approved to use in my USDC. So let me check in this here. Also, I'd like to see the balance.
01:14:24.640 - 01:14:56.726, Speaker A: Can see the balance of your account. Can see the balance of the smart contract. But I created these only to return the link balance and the USDC balance. And this is the only owner that you know that since the session two where we have the withdrawal token. So if you send the link to the token and then you'd like to get back after do the transaction, you can use this to withdraw back.
01:14:56.830 - 01:14:57.594, Speaker C: Okay.
01:15:03.934 - 01:15:33.404, Speaker A: Yes. Let's go forward now. I think the code is explained. But probably if you are trying to do this directly, you can't wait a bit more. Was okay. And probably I'm sorry, but we are here to work together and to be together with everyone. Sorry about you.
01:15:33.404 - 01:16:11.468, Speaker A: So let's come back here and I think you are almost done. What I'd like you to see here. I see. USDC. You can see that my contract is not allowed to use in my USDC, okay. And okay. I am the owner.
01:16:11.468 - 01:16:40.470, Speaker A: We can see the balance. So first of think I must. I must authorize my contract to using my USDC. Let's do that. And wait a minute. That I used to have a copy of the padding some moments and it's good moment to have it. And here we are.
01:16:40.470 - 01:17:11.818, Speaker A: Almost done. Okay, so what am I doing? Am I doing that? Proof USDC first. Now let's add the code for you. Thank you guys. I really forgot that. Oh, the translations are crazy. Oh, and I did not finish.
01:17:11.818 - 01:17:32.834, Speaker A: Okay, let's go here. Where? Let's go here. Almost here. Now I'm right. So let's go to this part. And I must delete this. Sorry guys.
01:17:32.834 - 01:18:01.298, Speaker A: What I must do now. I must approve the OSDC. So I must approve. It means that approve your is much counted to use. Yeah. We have huge problems now. So let's go forward.
01:18:01.298 - 01:18:22.206, Speaker A: Let's see if you can. Because probably the guy that we burned now can allow us to use the pad. So the idea is to approve your smart contact to use your USDC.
01:18:22.390 - 01:18:23.274, Speaker C: Okay.
01:18:24.374 - 01:18:31.950, Speaker A: But I'd like. Let's do less to be sure that you can have enough to do other things if you like.
01:18:31.982 - 01:18:32.714, Speaker C: Okay.
01:18:34.454 - 01:18:57.712, Speaker A: How to do that? Let's go here. This is the token. The USDC token. There is no trace. The block explorer of avalanche Fuji. And I came to the concrete part like you have on a telescope. And I came here right? As a proxy.
01:18:57.808 - 01:18:58.288, Speaker C: Okay.
01:18:58.336 - 01:19:40.344, Speaker A: I'm here. So in order to do that, I must connect my wallet. So how to connect my wallet? Go upstairs in the right side and click on signing Metamask. Next connect. Now I must sign a message signing. And now you can see. Not yet.
01:19:40.344 - 01:19:51.920, Speaker A: I should be signed here maybe. Good. Yes. Let's refresh and see. Femi.
01:19:51.952 - 01:19:52.524, Speaker C: Good.
01:19:53.704 - 01:20:09.578, Speaker A: Not yet. Let's try. Let's see. So let me go to approve. Yeah, I think I can do that. So approve. Who will be the spender? Okay, I will do this process one more time.
01:20:09.578 - 01:20:38.228, Speaker A: Including for myself signing and sign a message. So signing. Okay, do this process should be okay now? I'm not sure, but I hope so. So the expanded days match contract address and we are doing less. The value will be debt.
01:20:38.356 - 01:20:38.812, Speaker C: Okay.
01:20:38.868 - 01:21:00.734, Speaker A: Zero point 21 USDC. So let's get the address of my contract here. Come back. Should there is no trace. Paste the address. Get the value. Interesting guys, how much decimal places I have in SDC? I have six.
01:21:00.734 - 01:21:26.594, Speaker A: So if I'd like to have 0.1, it's one with five zeros. 12345. Okay, is this click on right. Sign the message again. And since that's not signing.
01:21:33.454 - 01:21:34.314, Speaker C: Oh.
01:21:36.734 - 01:22:20.066, Speaker A: Yeah, probably is us. We are broking this site again. Let's wait a bit more to have this done. I will sign with you. Or are you changing the conflict? I have another way to do this. Okay, let's do this in another way. I just think in another way.
01:22:20.066 - 01:22:58.870, Speaker A: Let's come back to remix. I'm only updating some part. Okay, this so 0.1 less. Okay, let's go on remix. So we have another way to do that on remix. Remember that I have the interface.
01:22:58.870 - 01:23:28.174, Speaker A: I imported the interface over there. So find the interface in the concrete. Deploy Internet transactions in the beginning. Find the interface over there. Contract interface ERc 20 token. This is the interface. Select go to IP address and use the address of USDC.
01:23:30.274 - 01:23:31.014, Speaker C: Here.
01:23:32.154 - 01:24:00.824, Speaker A: Then click on I address. So what I'm doing now, I have this interface connected with the USDC content. And now I can do that. So we must do the same over there. Go to approve. Approve. The expander is my contract.
01:24:00.824 - 01:24:43.672, Speaker A: The amount is how much is the amount? So the amount is this here is the amount. And now click on transact. So let's do. I do the transact part, but I do that again. Okay, one more time. This is interesting. I will stay here a bit more.
01:24:43.672 - 01:25:14.470, Speaker A: It's a shame that I cannot do the metamask big. Maybe I can. Yes. Okay, not so big. What am I doing here? I mean approving my smart contract to use my token and I'm improving exactly what I need now. 0.1 be careful about this.
01:25:14.470 - 01:26:19.184, Speaker A: When you are interacting with decentralized applications like decentralized exchanges, why that? They used to add this and add the maximum. What's the problem with that? If that decentralized application is hacked, maybe they can get all of your funds. So it's not a good practice to allow the maximum. If you allow the maximum, you are like paying fees only once to do that. But you can put your funds on risk because even if you have $100 for example, and you put the maximum, it can spend 2100. And every time that you deposit something or account can do it again. So be careful about that, okay? It's better if you add the cap only what you need.
01:26:19.184 - 01:27:21.214, Speaker A: So next and approve. I'm waiting down to be approved. And by the way, let's do this again. So how can I do here I am on deploying drone transactions, okay, scroll down until the contract part. Open this and choose ERC 20 token, okay, the interface ERC 20 token. And then in etsy address paste the address of USDC, okay? And then you have this, you have this interface down, okay. And here on the approved part, this is the address of my smart contract, the transfer USDC basic address.
01:27:21.214 - 01:28:13.414, Speaker A: And the amount is 0.1 because USDC has six decimal places and I'd like to have 0.1 here I have 50 and I did the transact. So if I come back to my transfer USDC basic and click on allusDC now, I can see that I approved that. So to be sure, we have my more contact over there. Hey guys, I think if this is your contract, you should be here. Okay, let's add you to another place and.
01:28:15.594 - 01:28:16.218, Speaker C: See.
01:28:16.346 - 01:28:38.914, Speaker A: So if I go to the allowance USDC on my contract, this is the result. Okay, but let's say that you must do that on transfer the USDC basic.
01:28:43.334 - 01:28:44.394, Speaker C: Okay.
01:28:47.264 - 01:29:27.814, Speaker A: So again, where is the approved part? First of all concrete, you must choose the ERC 20 token interface. The interface is over there. Do not deploy that. You can't here in address here, I'm going over there. Here's in the I address. Add the USDC concrete, then scroll down to the ERC 20 token. And here you must expand this part, the ERC and the approve is the first.
01:29:27.814 - 01:30:01.714, Speaker A: So expand the proof, add the smart contract, your smart contract address and add the amount. Okay, is that, is this. And after that you can check this part. Not on the ERC 20 token, but on the transfer. You can as well, but I'm checking the transfer USDC basic. Go to the Aulus USDC. Okay, here we are.
01:30:01.714 - 01:30:34.114, Speaker A: I did this three times. Guys. If you could not do now, check it out the video later. Okay, I'm going forward the next part that I must do. And I changed some parts here. So wait. Now I must be sure that my content has linked so on metamask and here.
01:30:34.114 - 01:31:02.114, Speaker A: And I prefer to send it three. On metamask, I will send three links to my contract. Okay, let's get the address of my contract. This is the address. Go to metamask tokens link. I. Why? I have too much here.
01:31:02.114 - 01:31:22.314, Speaker A: Sent and sent three links to my contract. Is the faucet good? Oh no.
01:31:23.134 - 01:31:24.074, Speaker C: Okay.
01:31:26.334 - 01:31:48.586, Speaker A: And this is. I miss sending now to my convict. I should send the tokens to the faucet. But I sent you myself. So let's fix that. I know that you still need tokens in the faucet. Wow.
01:31:48.586 - 01:32:08.214, Speaker A: Why this is right here. Yeah. This is strange. Yeah. I am in the right account. So how good. Now what I did? I sent link to my contact.
01:32:08.214 - 01:32:32.302, Speaker A: Wait a bit more, guys. This is my account. I just send a link to my contact. Let's see that. If you came into your content, go to the balances off. I'd like to see the balance of my contact first. This is the balance of my contact.
01:32:32.302 - 01:33:11.114, Speaker A: I have three links over there. This will be three and this will be three. So if I came here, you must wait now. Okay. Are you saying late? Not now. And if I go to balances off, this is the result. How good until now.
01:33:14.134 - 01:33:15.154, Speaker C: Okay.
01:33:17.214 - 01:33:45.998, Speaker A: Let'S see what happened with this person. You have enough to do that part. You have enough link. So sorry. I'm not sending nothing to you now. And we are done. So what we did until now, we deployed our comfort.
01:33:45.998 - 01:34:02.674, Speaker A: We came into the USDC token and approved our comfort to use our USDC. Then we came to the contact and send the link to our contact in order to pay the fees.
01:34:02.974 - 01:34:03.874, Speaker C: Okay.
01:34:05.334 - 01:34:36.532, Speaker A: With all of that, we are done to transfer USDC. And I know that we have some people that are not with us now. I can try to to help you late. Okay, so transfer USDC. Now the receiver will be your wallet address. The amount is 0.1 USDC.
01:34:36.532 - 01:34:49.424, Speaker A: We are doing that now. Let's go here. I am on transfer USDC. Basic. I will do this part. Transfer USDC to sepolia. So expand this.
01:34:49.424 - 01:35:45.836, Speaker A: The receiver is your wallet. The amount is must be in weight or in the. It's not weigh in this case. But is in the mid node unit, then I can click on transaction. So in exactly this moment, I miss sending a transaction to the CCIP part. This is the CCIP part and I'd like to see if you are with me now. I know that we lost some people.
01:35:45.836 - 01:36:26.284, Speaker A: Let's see, after that, I'd like to get my id. So how can I do that? I approved that on metamask. So come to metamask. This is the last transaction that I did. Click on that, copy the transaction id. So metamask, get the last transaction, copy transaction id, copy it, come back to the pet and paste it. And let's try to solve the problems.
01:36:26.284 - 01:36:39.220, Speaker A: This problem is happening because you didn't can be two problems.
01:36:39.252 - 01:36:39.944, Speaker C: Okay.
01:36:40.364 - 01:37:08.884, Speaker A: Problem number one, you didn't approve with the USDC. Three problems. Problem number one, you didn't approve the USDC. So check it out. The Aulus WASDC. Problem number two, check if you have link in the concrete. So paste the address of your concrete here, check the balance off.
01:37:08.884 - 01:37:23.794, Speaker A: Problem number three, check the address of your wallet. This is my wallet. And check if you have USDC on your wallet.
01:37:23.904 - 01:37:24.714, Speaker C: Okay.
01:37:28.534 - 01:38:06.474, Speaker A: And I will do it again. But wait a minute. Remember guys, you can see the video later. So I mean deleting the problem and out of this, let's go down now you must go to the circle cCAp explorer. And here I can check the status of my transaction. So let's get my transaction again. It's here.
01:38:06.474 - 01:38:36.164, Speaker A: Paste in the CCIP explorer. Wow. Success. You can see that, that I already pass all the phases. We have four phases over there. And I came from avalanche Fuji to assyrian Sepoya. And from this, this is my smart contract to my account.
01:38:36.164 - 01:38:40.004, Speaker A: And I transferred 0.1 YC.
01:38:40.704 - 01:38:41.724, Speaker C: Whoo hoo.
01:38:43.224 - 01:39:34.874, Speaker A: Let's see now what I must do. I must go to Sepoya and check it out. So let's put this step by step for you. I will come back again, okay? But this problem is because you USDC transaction problem, you didn't approve the content to use erOSDC, okay? So now let's go to Metamask. On Metamask, I'm going to Sepolia again. Sepoya. I'm on Sepoya now.
01:39:34.874 - 01:40:07.328, Speaker A: Tokens. I have all the tokens that we created, but I don't have USDC yet. So this is the address of USDC on sepolia. Let's edit USDC. I think I'm right. And oh, why have we more before? You cannot see because I have. You can see that I have 24.6.
01:40:07.328 - 01:40:39.124, Speaker A: Why I have too much. Oh, let's get that. So if I came here on the etherscan and try to see something like that, what's happening with my contact. This is how the transactions. How they transfer tokens. And I can see my balance over there. Let's go in the other way.
01:40:39.124 - 01:41:06.588, Speaker A: It's not so easy. Let's get my address. I'd like to prove you that I did this. Now I have these tokens out of this. This is the USDC. So now I am over there. And you can just saw that I received that two minutes ago on Sepoya.
01:41:06.756 - 01:41:07.624, Speaker C: Okay.
01:41:11.204 - 01:41:50.666, Speaker A: So let's try to help you with the ehurs. First of all, let's see some ehors. Yes, energy. I just let you know that we are preparing a git book without the instructors, without the interaction of the people. Okay, we are doing that as well. Prepare to have this in the end of the bootcamp. And yes, I know that this is hard, guys.
01:41:50.666 - 01:42:26.276, Speaker A: I know that this is a difficult session and you have all the weekend to review and try again. And we are here to help you. Okay, Tony, please let us know which network are you. Probably this has happened because you are in the wrong network. Are you on Fuji? Let's see. I'm coming back to see some ehors from you.
01:42:26.300 - 01:42:26.984, Speaker C: Okay.
01:42:38.684 - 01:43:18.752, Speaker A: Thank you. We have a lot of amazing people here and all of them are helping us. Tomorrow we have 1 hour only to solve the problems. I like to solve some mayhod. Let's see how we have three links for the fees. Also. Thiago, what's happened? I send it to my contact more than I need.
01:43:18.888 - 01:43:19.752, Speaker C: Okay.
01:43:19.928 - 01:43:29.608, Speaker A: And let's come back here to Fuji. Here on Fuji.
01:43:29.696 - 01:43:30.524, Speaker C: Okay.
01:43:31.584 - 01:44:03.814, Speaker A: I know that if I come back here on my contact and I saw my balance now you can see that I have 2.93. And okay, if I came to explore this was the fees. But because sometimes the fee can be more expensive than this, I prefer to send it three links. And if I'd like to get my link back, I can. I came here now and withdraw the token to myself again.
01:44:03.894 - 01:44:04.674, Speaker C: Okay.
01:44:07.134 - 01:44:31.870, Speaker A: Yes. And the amount of link is in the contract. Now is this. Let's see. Can we convert? Convert link to your USDC only in a decentralized exchange. Not here. Okay.
01:44:31.870 - 01:45:11.418, Speaker A: Taking to convert this only you depends on the smart content in the way that we did that. Only you have access to that link. Because it's only you can withdraw that link. But another person can use your link. Yes, another person can use your transfer USDC base kitschu transfer tokens and then you are paying the fees to do that.
01:45:11.506 - 01:45:12.294, Speaker C: Okay.
01:45:16.434 - 01:45:37.398, Speaker A: What more? There are some contact. I'd like to see someone. Let's see if someone is good. So, are you getting the contact of another person? Approve. Let's see what's happened with AJ. I see yours now. This is your contact.
01:45:37.398 - 01:46:07.840, Speaker A: Okay, let's see your contacts. Come back here and come back to the transfer USDC base key. This is the address of AJ contract. And let's see if you are good now like AJ. Come here. Pay attention. Your problem is you didn't allow the contact to use.
01:46:07.840 - 01:46:31.104, Speaker A: If you'd like to do it again, you can't, okay? Because of this. Let's see your contact here as well. I'd like to see what's happened with your contact. Yeah. In fact, yes. So AJ. Yes, exactly.
01:46:31.104 - 01:46:37.432, Speaker A: Exactly. Pay attention. I miss solving your problem. Okay? You are trying to do what you can't do.
01:46:37.488 - 01:46:38.168, Speaker C: Okay?
01:46:38.296 - 01:47:31.878, Speaker A: Why you can't do? Because I can see here that you didn't approve the contract to use your SDC. So what you should do now, we have two options. First, remember that I created this ERC 20 token, this interface with the USDC address. So on this interface, we must go here and approve your content to use your USDC. So get the address of your token and the amount and the transact. After you do that, if you come back here, you can see that this must be one and something.
01:47:32.006 - 01:47:32.834, Speaker C: Okay.
01:47:33.414 - 01:48:16.064, Speaker A: Is this destiny not working? Exactly. Hide. Hide this comment. Okay. What more? And Tony, you can try, but I don't know if this is working because I'm doing on metamask. I don't know what's the behavior on wallet connect? You can do it and let us know. Oh, really? Maybe you can get this from your wallet on the telescope.
01:48:16.064 - 01:48:54.534, Speaker A: Ok. To get the contact address again. And I used to ask you to add the contact address in the pad because we can get it later. Is the message id? The message id is different from the transaction id. The message id is unique. And in the message id we have the transaction id from both chains. And let's see yours.
01:48:54.534 - 01:49:10.702, Speaker A: What is. How can I find you here? Young, are you here? What line are you? You are not here. If I know your name, I can help you.
01:49:10.798 - 01:49:11.594, Speaker C: Okay.
01:49:15.954 - 01:49:35.258, Speaker A: Where we get the transaction id? This is easy. Go to metamask and activity. This is the transaction that you use it. Contact, interaction and copy transaction id.
01:49:35.386 - 01:49:36.214, Speaker C: Okay?
01:49:42.094 - 01:50:06.990, Speaker A: Yes. So you are here. I'd like to know the address of your comfort. Could you highlight them in the pad or let me know which line is you. The spending cap should be the same amount that you are transferring. Okay. 0.1
01:50:06.990 - 01:50:42.494, Speaker A: USDC. This is what we are doing. And remember that you can get supporting the bootcamp channel. Go over there today after the class. Also we created this debits form for you. And tomorrow we have you 1 hour related to that here. So if you came here in the dubbed form, you can add your email, your name and your question.
01:50:42.494 - 01:51:27.504, Speaker A: So let's come back here and remember what more do you have over there that you need? What is the difference between approval is not trace versus remix? It's the same. But I used to do not trace. Not trace was not working for me. I could not connect my wallet. So I decided to do that on remix. Okay, it's up to you. One or other.
01:51:27.504 - 01:52:05.248, Speaker A: Yes, we have the dubbed form over there. Are you at a bit more of link in the. Ah, yes, let's. I cannot copy. Young, I must go to the YouTube to copy this. Where I am, I cannot copy. Let's try to get it.
01:52:05.336 - 01:52:06.004, Speaker C: Wait.
01:52:10.104 - 01:52:32.874, Speaker A: So this is from my friend that I'd like to solve now. Let's go. No, but this is the transaction hash. I'd like to get your smart content. This cannot be useful for me now. Yeah, this is the hash. Add the content.
01:52:32.874 - 01:52:50.908, Speaker A: Okay, let's see. What is this? This is you interact with the concrete over there. I'd like to see your transfer content.
01:52:50.996 - 01:52:51.744, Speaker C: Okay.
01:52:59.804 - 01:53:55.828, Speaker A: What more? In the last session, we have some approach related to how to get a job. But what I can tell you about that, like doing the boot camp and doing all the exercise. And maybe later you can create your own GitHub with the exercises. Create projects related to that. If you can prove that you already know this kind of stuff, this can help you. Is this and why I needed to approve? Because this is the concept of ERC 20 tokens. If you send the token directly to the smart contract, didn't know that received the token.
01:53:55.828 - 01:54:15.326, Speaker A: So the approach is always approve someone else to use your token. So approve the smart contract to use your token. And then inside the smart content, you can see here that we are transferring from your account.
01:54:15.510 - 01:54:16.394, Speaker C: Okay.
01:54:21.174 - 01:55:10.680, Speaker A: And what is an interface? An interface. It's the declaration of functions. And you use that interface with the address of some mismatched content that is already deployed. Okay, so interface are used to interact with contents that already deploy it. On the interface, you are not defining the instructions, the command of each function. You only declare the interface itself. It means that you declare how is each operation like how is the transfer? The transfer is expecting to receive an address and a integer.
01:55:10.680 - 01:55:43.924, Speaker A: The transfer from is expecting q address and this. So with this how the interfaces to do that? So this is a structure that is created. Remember that I told you that in order to use the chaining CCIP, you must use some structures created by chaining. This is a structure created to define the tokens.
01:55:44.004 - 01:55:44.784, Speaker C: Okay.
01:55:45.604 - 01:56:22.862, Speaker A: And here I'm creating a variable called token amount using this structure. This is an array. I'm creating that array with only one, one position in that array. Yes. Feel free to publish the code on GitHub because you are creating that yourself. You can tell that I learned this in the chainic bootcamp. Yes.
01:56:22.862 - 01:56:40.830, Speaker A: And the URL to usages in the future. Remember that we used to say that before usages don't usually do some audit if you are doing like a real project. But these are the basics to you.
01:56:40.902 - 01:56:41.674, Speaker C: Okay.
01:56:48.794 - 01:57:06.114, Speaker A: Yes. Oh wow. I know. What's your problem? Your problem is that you are or you are not using the solidity version or you don't have the autocompile selected. And here you have another solidity version.
01:57:06.154 - 01:57:06.854, Speaker C: Okay.
01:57:07.354 - 01:57:48.938, Speaker A: My recommendation, turn on the autocompile. So let's go to the form. Yes. Remember that in order to go forward, go to the form that you did before and you are here. You must paste the address of your smart content and the transaction that you get. How can you get the transaction? The transaction is the transaction that you add here. Yes, the transaction id.
01:57:48.938 - 01:58:02.026, Speaker A: So this is the transaction when you are on avalanche Fuji and you call it the transfer to Sepolia. This is the transaction id that I'm expecting over there.
01:58:02.130 - 01:58:02.934, Speaker C: Okay.
01:58:09.614 - 01:58:31.760, Speaker A: I think it's time to finish. Let's see if I have a bit more here for you. We did the explore part. Oh yes. Let's. In order to wrap up everything, let's finish this. So you are here.
01:58:31.760 - 01:59:06.010, Speaker A: This was the work flow that we did. We did the wrong on rank part. So what's happened here with the token? The token depends of the owner of the token. So what how circle deal with this circle used to burn the token on one chain and mint the token on the other chain. Okay, so this is one of the approaches. This is the token handling mechanisms. It can burn in one chain, minting another chain.
01:59:06.010 - 01:59:13.570, Speaker A: But some kinds of tokens can be locked in one chain and then you mint in the other chain.
01:59:13.682 - 01:59:14.434, Speaker C: Okay.
01:59:14.594 - 01:59:19.442, Speaker A: Depends if this is an activity token from one chain.
01:59:19.538 - 01:59:20.294, Speaker C: Okay.
01:59:22.034 - 01:59:55.094, Speaker A: What more? And remember that you are being prepared to participate in the next hackathon. If you didn't yet, you can subscribe to the next hackathon and you are learning a lot. I'm sure that you'll be capable to create an amazing project and I think we are good today. Bara, are you here? You'd like to finish with me?
01:59:56.754 - 01:59:57.130, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:59:57.162 - 01:59:58.574, Speaker B: So ranch. I'm here.
01:59:59.154 - 02:00:00.134, Speaker A: Amazing.
02:00:00.514 - 02:00:01.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I think.
02:00:02.554 - 02:00:03.774, Speaker A: Yes, you can talk.
02:00:04.514 - 02:00:06.694, Speaker B: No, please go ahead. Sorry.
02:00:07.074 - 02:00:16.786, Speaker A: No, this is a difficult session, guys. I know, but you have more time to try it and you have the hack or everything to check it out later.
02:00:16.850 - 02:00:17.574, Speaker C: Okay.
02:00:18.714 - 02:00:47.894, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I can see there are few people who are still able to trying to deploy it. Don't worry, you can always come back to the video, do it on your own pace because the session is already recorded. You can come back and watch the video. And if you still can't do it, don't worry. We have a community on the discord. So please do join the discord community where we have the bootcamp channel. We are there to help you out in each and every step that you're facing problem with.
02:00:47.894 - 02:01:38.224, Speaker B: So feel free to know, ask your questions there and you know, our community will definitely help you out, like with all your questions out there. And yeah, like I said, feel free to fill out that, you know, dows form. We, I think tomorrow we gonna have a good amount of time to answer a lot of questions from the previous sessions and also the CCIP session today. So I think make sure that, you know, you fill the form, come back tomorrow so that you can get answers to all your questions. And yeah, if you learn something today or like did your first cross chain transfer. And if you feel like, you know, this is amazing, feel free to share your experience about the bootcamp using the hashtags hash Chainlinkbootcamp 2024. So that, you know, we get to know more about like what's your experience, what you learn, show it to the world like you read your first cross chain transfer today.
02:01:38.224 - 02:02:14.524, Speaker B: Because I don't think, like, not many people in the web three space haven't done a cross and transferred. So you are that, you know, top 10% of the devs who might have done this right. So showcase it to the world as well. And I think you can also tag Solan so that, you know, she'll also retweet and, you know, share with the rest of her community as well. And yeah, I think with that, like I said, feel free to join the Discord channel, post your questions, and tomorrow come back. We have some surprise session to build on Celo. So don't forget that, you know, this is something that is cool that you can learn on how to build on Celo, which is another blockchain.
02:02:14.524 - 02:02:17.444, Speaker B: So I wanted to see you there as well.
02:02:18.144 - 02:02:40.144, Speaker A: So exactly like Ibarat told you. Yes. Tomorrow we have a session with Celo. Celo is another blockchain that you can use some of the chaining services same time from today. And if you don't have a problem, it's not related to debits. We have cello with you as well. I really recommend you to be here.
02:02:41.084 - 02:03:08.594, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think Solange, we can call it for a day. Thanks a lot for everybody joining us. I know it's too much for you because you're still getting started, but like I said, we are here to help you out with all the things, things that you need. So I think we can call it for a day and. Yeah, thanks so much for, like, taking your time and, you know, teaching, like, you know, a step by step process on how to do this crossing transaction. Thanks a lot to you for, like, spending a lot of your time educating.
02:03:08.894 - 02:03:14.838, Speaker A: People globally, securing be here, Barat. See you. Bye bye.
02:03:14.886 - 02:03:15.854, Speaker B: Have a great day.
02:03:16.014 - 02:03:16.334, Speaker C: You too.
