00:00:10.010 - 00:00:53.706, Speaker A: So this space this year, a lot of big headlines, not all for the best reason, specifically around the subject of transparency and security. This summer, multiple centralized financial institutions declared bankruptcy, with reports they been insolvent months before all of this, while, real world asset tokenization from centralized institutions continues to push the market forward. So where do we go from here? Well, today we have a great panel for you. We are going to be talking about proof of reserve, transparency, security, and the future of real world assets. I'm going to let the panelists introduce themselves, tell us a little bit about who you are, your name, what you're working on, and we'll get started with the discussion. Happy to.
00:00:53.728 - 00:01:15.090, Speaker B: Thank you, Max. My name is Michael Gas York. I've gotten my start as a marketer with my own agency during the era of the ICOs and ended up working on a whole bunch of projects during that time. One of the projects was trust token. Good friends of mine as well ended up joining them full time. And along the way, we launched a really popular unsecured lending protocol, Truefi. You'll maybe hear more about that.
00:01:15.090 - 00:01:34.490, Speaker B: And I was working a lot on our very popular stablecoin, TUSD, probably the most transparent one in the market, especially as what we'll announce today. Along the way, trust token has become archblock with a big institutional focus, and Truefi has gone and fully decentralized. That's where I lead marketing today, really trying to bring more liquidity on chain and also put real world assets on chain.
00:01:36.670 - 00:01:58.980, Speaker C: My name is Brian Hanke. I'm a co founder at Cash. What we're trying to do is to build transparent infrastructure for the tokenization of physical assets. We leverage the chainlink proof of reserve to do that, and our goal is to provide fully transparent assets that are publicly audible in real time.
00:02:00.230 - 00:02:01.118, Speaker A: Noah?
00:02:01.294 - 00:02:31.830, Speaker D: Thanks, Max. Hey, everybody, I'm Noah Buxton. I'm a partner at Arminino LLP, which is a large CPA public accounting firm. Top 20 by revenue in the US, and been in the space since 2016, roughly. Our firm was the first financial statement audit firm for Coinbase 2014 to 2018. I got pulled down that rabbit hole in 2016 and really wanted to do more. Basically saw that there was a ton of potential in this space as we saw personal finance and capital markets and crypto assets changing.
00:02:31.830 - 00:03:06.422, Speaker D: Who should be involved? Certainly a public accounting firm who deals in ledgers and assets should be involved. And so since 2019, I've led our digital asset industry practice, and we do a lot of things, frankly, but you can kind of think of our work as traditional audit tax attest services applied with a crypto expertise to this space. So serving large exchanges, funds, broker dealers, token projects, just about every constituent in the space, we do a traditional accounting service for. And then the stuff I'm really excited about and really proud of is our sort of innovation piece.
00:03:06.476 - 00:03:06.694, Speaker B: Right?
00:03:06.732 - 00:03:49.934, Speaker D: So we've launched a platform called Trust Explorer in late 2018, and it was actually the world's first real time audit application, or real time attest application. So today that system provides real time transparency and industry standard attest reporting to anyone, to the public, to retail users and institutional users alike, around roughly $40 billion worth of crypto assets. So our total AUA, as we call it, is around 40 billion and growing. And have been partnered with Chainlink for a couple of years now. And actually taking this sort of middleware of trust and transparency to the next level, trying to work with key partners to actually put this trusted information on chain free spice smart contracts.
00:03:50.062 - 00:04:05.660, Speaker B: And we've been long term partners Armanino, since pretty much the very start using them for attestations of our reserves, and now also proud users of the trust Explorer platform. So our attestations on the reserves of treesd are happening every 30 seconds and we really couldn't do it without them.
00:04:06.430 - 00:04:20.990, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, the name of this panel is proof of reserve Roundtable. Noah, I want to go back to you. Proof of reserve. Interesting term. Can you explain, in your words, maybe give people who aren't familiar a definition, what is proof of reserve?
00:04:21.650 - 00:05:22.014, Speaker D: Absolutely. Yeah. So in the most pure sense, it's the ability for an issuer, a custodian, a platform operator, a marketplace, to provide transparency to users, right. That if it's a one to one promise that they've made to their customers or to the market, that they actually have the assets to back up that tokenized promise or that tokenized liability. And there's a lot you can say about this, but a quick historical point is that this term, proof of reserves, was actually first used in 2014 by Greg Maxwell, who's a well known bitcoin developer and post mount Gox days, he was theorizing how we could check the evil exchange, as he said. And what he proposed was a very interesting model where you could do digital signatures to prove assets held in commingled custody at a retail exchange. And on the liability side, you could do cryptographic proofs or use merkel trees, which are core to bitcoin as well, for roll up of transactions, and that the user could actually participate.
00:05:22.014 - 00:05:55.146, Speaker D: They could actually cryptographically participate and know that they were included in a liability set. So that's where this really incepted, I guess you could say. But it's really become a community driven or market driven term sense. And so when we say proof of reserves, we're talking about this general idea that we can have trust and transparency and say a tokenized asset or an account liability. Right. However, it's evolving in a very meaningful way. Right? So sort of the edge cases of proof of reserves or the bleeding edge is really this on chain proof of reserves.
00:05:55.178 - 00:05:55.374, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:55.412 - 00:06:06.660, Speaker D: The idea that sort of different types of issuers or different types of custodians or platforms or marketplaces can provide this type of transparency in an automated and on chain way.
00:06:07.030 - 00:06:22.434, Speaker A: Michael, I want to go to you next. One of the big announcements from this conference happened yesterday. TUSD announced they're implementing Chainlink proof of reserve, not just on chain, but into the minting function of TUSD. Can you maybe elaborate on why that's important, both the TUSD holders and defi protocols alike?
00:06:22.482 - 00:07:14.598, Speaker B: Sure. So I would say the sort of market wide bleeding edge sort of transparency bar today is monthly attestations of your reserves. That's about on par for industry. We're already well past that with integration with Chainlink and with harmonino to do attestations live every 30 seconds with the proof of reserves right there available on the front end. The thing that we're announcing here at this conference is a move away from just using the data of the reserves to report on the reserves being held in custody, but actually using that data to be a bottleneck to minting. What that means is only when the reserves held by our escrow banks are provenly on par with the outgoing TUSD is a mint allowed to happen. And it doesn't slow down the minting at all.
00:07:14.598 - 00:07:51.810, Speaker B: It's a really bleeding edge whole new bar for transparency in stablecoins that shifts the usage of data from simply informational to actionable. It doesn't allow minting of new to USD to happen until the reserves are provenly in the bank. This helps prevent infinite mint hacks. This helps prevent vastly de pegged reserves. And it really, I think is the new bar for transparency and stablecoins, which remain a key building block in Defi. And we're really proud to do that here. And with Chini Garmino as our key partners, we couldn't do without them.
00:07:51.960 - 00:08:13.990, Speaker A: Awesome. Brian, I want to talk about cash gold for a second. You guys have five vaults across three continents and you're using proof of reserve to, in real time put your reserve data on chain and into your minting function. Five vaults across three continents. I feel like I'd have trouble just keeping track internally, let alone have all that data in real time on chain. Can you talk to us a bit about the architecture behind that and how it operates?
00:08:14.150 - 00:08:47.010, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Before we even started cash, we developed a asset tracking technology we call Gram chain. And part of Gramchain is we have handheld scanners that we distribute to the vaults. They're Internet connected. And the vaults, when they receive or withdraw the gold, they track the gold using those scanners. That data is broadcast to the blockchain in real time, so it's timestamped and it prevents any tampering. And then that in turn, updates the proof of reserve.
00:08:48.310 - 00:09:04.620, Speaker A: All right, let's open it up in a bit. I'm curious too, because in traditional finance, audits are done maybe once a month, once a quarter, maybe once a year. You guys are all working with audits in real time. Why is real time transparency important? Why not just do an audit once a month?
00:09:06.350 - 00:09:41.190, Speaker B: The area of stablecoins these days, especially when it underpins a multi billion dollar industry. In DeFi, these are key building blocks. A lot can go wrong. Again. There's opportunities for hacks of these stablecoins for de pegging. And when so much of DeFi is undergirded by these key building blocks, it's really, really key that they function properly, that they function really, really well at the stations. Transparency is pretty much one of the few things we can do in stables, not just to differentiate against our competitors, but also to build a very honest, transparent, and resilient industry.
00:09:41.190 - 00:10:19.166, Speaker B: Unfortunately, some of the transparency didn't make it all the way to lending, for example, which is why I think we found some things that happened this year with some centralized lenders and even a few decentralized lenders, where they got into a lot of trouble. And the argument we have is that transparency isn't just a nice to have, it's not just a little feature. It's a key part of infrastructure that makes our market more resilient. And in these early days, infrastructure is not built all the way yet. We're in the era I compare to sort of early Silicon Valley. We had to build your own server racks and run that if you wanted to build a startup. So all the more reason to make the key infrastructure extremely resilient and transparent is one of the key ways to do that effectively.
00:10:19.166 - 00:10:38.070, Speaker B: 32nd at the stations is the best in the industry. Putting them on chain and then using them to actually do the minting. This is kind of the new bar. And so to see the future of stablecoins and DFI industry, I think this is sort of a now must have if you're going to be in the world of stables and if you're going to build on them as part of DefI.
00:10:39.050 - 00:11:25.670, Speaker D: Yeah, from my perspective, there's a number of drivers here. I think Michael states it well, but I think there's sort of the demand in the marketplace, right? Stablecoins are still very young, and just a couple of years ago there was a high level of distrust, essentially, right. High level of skepticism among retail users, institutions and regulators alike. And some of that still persists. But some of this is simply driven by what the customer wants, right? And so what trust token did is give the people what they want. So with this skepticism being so easily communicated on social media and other sort of easily broadcast channels, the token issuer says, okay, we've got to do something, right? We've got to go raise the bar. So that's certainly one driver here for innovation and assurance.
00:11:25.670 - 00:12:14.982, Speaker D: The other one, personally, from my perspective, is I'm not just a guy who works at an accounting firm. I actually really am passionate and deeply believe in this space, right? I believe that tokenization of assets and capital markets is inevitable. It's something that, frankly, it's something that's been set in motion that can't be stopped. These markets will be more liquid, more fair, more transparent, more disintermediated. And so from my perspective, what I do in my daily job, right, we've got to advance our part of the space that we can, the part of the space that we can move is to make transparency and assurance and trust models also more liquid, more freely available, more automated, and more on chain. And so that's kind of the team spirit that we have. The team believes deeply in that.
00:12:14.982 - 00:13:17.158, Speaker D: And so we've pushed very hard, not only within our own walls of the firm, right? We have to convince a lot of people and do a lot of politicking to say why we should take these risks, but also outside the firm. So the CPA industry is governed by the Public Accounting Oversight Board as well as the American Institute of Certified public Accountants in the US. And there are similar institutions and other jurisdictions, but they set the standards. And so we work deeply or sort of frequently on these working groups with these standard setters to educate them about what is possible and why we can still provide a trusted function under standards, with ethics, with independence, all of those required components. But we can do it in an automated, real time way. Ultimately that is better, faster, stronger and more resilient than traditional or sort of old modes of assurance. And what you get at the end of the day with those two things is, I truly believe, is that tokenized markets again can realize their full potential.
00:13:17.158 - 00:13:22.490, Speaker D: So it's a bit inevitable, but there's still hard work to be done to realize that full potential.
00:13:23.390 - 00:13:40.830, Speaker A: Yeah. BrEnnan I'm interested in gold, too, right? Because a lot of real world assets are coming on chain. They're being tokenized. But something like gold has a cost to it. There's a cost to store, there's a cost to audit, there's a cost for security. How do you transparently show how that cost is collected? Could you elaborate?
00:13:40.990 - 00:14:19.102, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So we just programmed this into the smart contract. We have both a small transfer fee and a storage fee. You need to have both of them because there is a way for somebody to avoid one or the other. Like if you wrap the asset in some kind of a wrapper, you could avoid the transfer fee. So this is all automatically calculated in the contract. And whenever tokens are sent, received, or if the pay storage fee function is triggered by us, then they are paid.
00:14:19.102 - 00:14:27.330, Speaker C: But this is enforced by the smart contract. We can't take any more than is owed. It's calculated on a prorated daily basis.
00:14:27.830 - 00:14:48.754, Speaker A: Gotcha. Michael, I think it's interesting we have you here because in terms of recent events, about a month ago, OFac sanctioned the tornado cash contract. You're a stablecoin. We saw other stablecoins interact in certain ways once that happened. How do you balance the transparency, but also the privacy of users when you're managing such a large asset?
00:14:48.802 - 00:15:23.730, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I was thankfully just talking about this with our legal department to know sort of where to thread the needle here. One of the first things I would say is privacy is effectively a user feature. Apple is probably the market leader in this regard in actually competing in sort of the broad markets. They do use privacy as a competitive differentiator against some of the other sort of smartphone and OS providers. And we think similarly about stables and generally defi and sort of crypto markets as a whole. You use privacy as a way of differentiating against, say, maybe a central bank digital currency, which wouldn't offer per se the same sort of competitive element and the privacy element.
00:15:23.730 - 00:16:11.300, Speaker B: So when we think about building our assets, when we think about building our lending protocol, we generally prioritize privacy first. When we build for the user, that's who we ultimately serve. And then we also go well above and beyond with transparency, with folks like Carmenino and Chainlink to be proactive with regulators and go well above and beyond what they might expect in terms of transparency attestations and sort of transparent use. With that said, what we think about this is, I borrow sort of SBF's of a whitelist, a blacklist, not a whitelist. You sanction and expunge any bad actors that are provenly bad. You do that as proactively as possible, but certainly reactively. We do nothing without a warrant and very serious due process.
00:16:11.300 - 00:16:49.760, Speaker B: And then generally you build the most transparent and private stablecoin you can. So that's sort of our priority. That's our mo to book for the user, privacy first, and then to abide by all sanctions, regulations, transparency requirements, and to also be proactive in terms of regulation. And that does come in the form of transparency. It also comes with working tightly with regulators. We do really stand far and above what the sort of required baseline for stablecoins that are asset backed are. At least we have in house legal and out of house legal that work with sort of policy groups as well as regulators directly, even getting to the point of talking to some of them in the house.
00:16:49.760 - 00:17:22.710, Speaker B: And we really do try to stay far away and beyond what the minimum bar is. And being asset backed, I think also makes us a little bit safer relative to say, our algorithmically built competitors there. So privacy first regulations as needed, focus on the user and compete with privacy as a key offering, and then sort of build around the blacklist and expunge bad actors versus the whitelist of only allowing vetted, greenlisted folks to use it. We really do want this to have global adoption.
00:17:22.870 - 00:17:48.450, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I think back to a year ago, guys, and everything was going to be tokenized. Lamborghinis, Picasso art, seemed like there was no limit to what people were looking tokenize. Noah, I guess I'll start with you. What else can be tokenized? You work with a number of different projects in terms of auditing, carbon credits open for you guys. What do you think else comes to the market in terms of tokenization? Or what have you seen personally?
00:17:49.510 - 00:19:02.978, Speaker D: Yeah, I think anything is and has been ripe for tokenization. To me, it's not really what's possible, right? Just about anything is possible. There's a few barriers to sort of real liquidity, real secondary markets, real sort of meat in these pools or markets. And so I think some of it, you could just generally say is infrastructure, right? So if you look at sort of the providers or the, I guess you'd call them software providers or tech startups like securitize would be an example that uses Ethereum as a base chain to tokenize different types of securities, largely private securities offerings. That's a very compelling space because private securities make up something like $13 trillion worth of assets just in the US, right? These are real estate deals, mortgage loans, debt pools. They're generally sort of regulation d offerings, LP interests, and they're very illiquid, right? So if you own part of a condo deal in Florida, the secondary market is not liquid, right. There is not a nice trading application or venue to kind of get out of that asset with any speed.
00:19:02.978 - 00:20:38.786, Speaker D: And if you are able to get out of it with any speed, you have a high fee on the way out too, because you've got paperwork to push and lawyers to pay. And so the idea that you can tokenize those things and make them liquid is very possible. The other barrier though is the general partners that put these deals together, right? The general partners that essentially put together a reg offering for all of that real estate in Florida or that class a real estate in Texas or whatever, they're traditionalists, right? They are baked in their models. And so the idea that, oh, we're going to now go use a platform, we're going to tokenize these LP shares and we're going to provide a platform and then a secondary market, sort of the T zero type approach, for instance, you see that that's been hard uptake, but I guess, yeah, sorry to go along, but to your question, yeah, I think commodities are ripe for tokenization for sure, because you have capital markets, macro investors that invest in things like gold, right? They invest in it not because they want to have gold bars to touch, but because it's a great hedging asset, right? It's a macro asset with deep liquidity. But how do they buy it? They buy it with GLD, right? They buy it with paper gold. And so they're getting this just number exposure. So things like cash gold, and the idea that you can tokenize real physical gold that you can know it's fully reserved in certain vaults, I think eats into those types of commodity markets, right? Tokenized commodities can quickly become macro assets that large institutions can play in, right? They can accept that risk, they can understand it, and ultimately, again, it's better, faster, cheaper, more transparent.
00:20:38.786 - 00:20:43.546, Speaker D: So they like that kind of stuff. Yeah, I'll cut it there.
00:20:43.728 - 00:21:06.030, Speaker A: Brian, I think you need to put no on your BD team to get cash gold out. But on the topic of, you know, I think there's an interesting parallel between crypto and gold in the sense that they're sometimes seen as a hedge against fiat currencies. What is the future for tokenized gold? What are the benefits, I guess, to holding cash gold, as opposed to getting exposure through traditional financial markets with gold?
00:21:06.690 - 00:21:52.350, Speaker C: Well, with tokenized gold, you basically have all the benefits of ethereum, bitcoin, any kind of digital token you can transfer peer to peer in a trustless fashion. It makes it infinitely portable. It facilitates new use cases like global netting and swapping, so you could eliminate the need for slow and costly shipping of gold. It creates the opportunity for new financial services and products that have this type of real time transparency, which existing ETFs do not. So really any use case you can imagine, tokenized gold is programmable gold. It can support any application you can imagine.
00:21:52.850 - 00:22:06.050, Speaker A: Got you now to come back for proof of reserve for a moment. Both of you are issuers that are engaged with proof of reserve data that's going on chain. I guess aside from putting it in minting, what are the other benefits to writing reserve data on chain?
00:22:07.510 - 00:22:45.762, Speaker B: Well, I think one of the things it does is it makes the data itself programmable and composable. There's really interesting things when you can take not just the asset and make that composable programmable. You see really interesting innovations in DeFi when you make the data programmable as well. We've seen people use the data of our reserves in really interesting ways. The hackathons using it to build their own stablecoins, for example, by using the data as one of the pegs to create a composite stablecoin of, say, different forex assets. We have five forex assets, and they're using the data to build, say, an FX token comprised of multiple assets beyond it. So we have composable data.
00:22:45.762 - 00:23:02.520, Speaker B: You can use composable data to build, to feed it into, say, regulator needs too. So I think the really interesting thing about this question is, there's not a great answer because the opportunity space is so large, but the thing I'm most excited about always is how people use it to build.
00:23:03.130 - 00:23:49.634, Speaker D: Yeah, there's people in this room that are far smarter than I am. So I think it's like up to the creative talents of developers, DAP developers and protocols to sort of see why this information could be useful and what could be built. Yeah, some of the things that come to mind in DeFi would certainly be risk know circuit breakers. Right? Understanding that as you've got pools of stablecoins essentially that there can be a downstream risk measure to know the collateralization ratio or proof of reserve of a given tokenized asset. And that can be a good risk measure. On the DeFi side, I think it complicates things, certainly. So there's some downside to complexity, but there's certainly some upside to risk measures.
00:23:49.634 - 00:24:28.020, Speaker D: And those things could be like pausing withdrawals, for instance, or could be notification to users with on chain messaging. Again, I don't know, the world is our oyster here. LTV ratios I think would become something that could be very interesting, right. As stablecoin has a proof of reserve history, right? Maybe there's not just a point in time component to this, but there's a historical on chain component, right? A sort of a proof of reserves, credit rating sort of aspect to this where over time trust is compounding on itself. Right? So yeah, those are just some initial ideas, but again, smarter people than I will come up with that and put it into code.
00:24:28.950 - 00:24:48.920, Speaker A: Great. Now, launching a new asset, especially a real world asset, is no easy task. Each of you have either done that or work closely with projects who have. If you were to rewind, give yourself some advice, or perhaps there's someone listening in the audience today that's looking at launching a new asset, real world asset. What would you tell them? What advice would you give to someone looking to enter this market?
00:24:49.370 - 00:25:36.422, Speaker B: That's a good one? Well, when I first joined trust token, now Archblock, I was tasked with marketing a stablecoin, and I found pretty quickly it was effectively, hope this is still appropriate. But effectively selling ICE to Eskimos is not a differentiated product insomuch as the primary thing between stablecoins. They all try to compete on their peg and they try to compete on their redeemability. And so we needed to find a competitive edge for us with transparency, while also maintaining privacy as a means of competing with other stablecoins. But beyond that, you also need to have very strong BD relationships to navigate adoption. Marketing isn't really good enough on its own. You need to actually find inroads into getting large amounts of this asset minted, and you also need to find ways for integrations to succeed in the market.
00:25:36.422 - 00:26:20.386, Speaker B: Maybe that's using the asset as a liquidity off ramp, maybe it's some yield offering that your asset builds in. But what I really want to get at is as you build an asset of any sort, you really, really need to focus on the competitive edge you're going to have against other assets of its kind. You're also going to need to be able to get a strong BD effort to get adoption for it with both integrations, with liquidity, with some sort of competitive offering, maybe off ramps or yield. And finally, it's probably obvious, but you're going to need to have a strong regulatory background, a strong compliance background in order to make sure this thing is not regulated of existence either. And maybe finally, I'll end with, you're also probably going to need to have a strong risk department. We've also seen how that's taken stablecoins out of the market. So it's not an easy business, I won't lie.
00:26:20.386 - 00:26:32.090, Speaker B: But I think there's a lot behind it. If you are able to do this successfully, you can have a multibillion dollar asset in your hands, and that effectively unlocks a lot of opportunity for growth and profitability.
00:26:33.550 - 00:26:46.000, Speaker A: Okay, great. I want to give you guys a chance to brag on yourselves. The space is constantly developing. What's on the roadmap for you guys moving forward? Any new innovations? New blockchains? Brian, if you want to kick it off, sure.
00:26:46.850 - 00:27:39.310, Speaker C: Well, we definitely want to continue to expand onto more chains. We're looking pretty closely at ZK, sync and arbitrum, but we're open to considering any of them coming up pretty soon. End of this year, early next, we're going to launch support for non fungible assets and NFTs, all kinds of different things like watches and art and who knows what's next. And also we're making the entire cash infrastructure available to other products or, sorry, other projects and businesses as a white label product so that they can have access to the explorer, gram chain, asset tracking, Chainlink, proof of reserve. And they can add digital gold, eventually other assets to their applications as easily as you could add payments with a stripe API.
00:27:41.730 - 00:28:21.014, Speaker D: Yeah, got a lot going on. So I'd say there's a few key initiatives at the tail end of this year and into next year. One of them is on standards, which doesn't have anybody jumping out of their seat with excitement right now. But the truth of it is that we're working with a couple of, I would say, key market participants and regulators, standard setters and standard bodies to provide clarity. Right. And so one of the areas that we're working on is specifically for stablecoins and similar asset backed tokens and providing a meaningful framework for this attest.
00:28:21.062 - 00:28:21.226, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:21.248 - 00:28:30.554, Speaker D: There's a few firms that can do this. Armanino is the only one that can do it real time so far. We'd love some competition, frankly, but there needs to be more of a framework.
00:28:30.602 - 00:28:30.814, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:30.852 - 00:29:18.190, Speaker D: The largest accounting firms across the world are hesitant to accept this type of work unless they can point to a framework and show their risk team. This is the framework we follow, and it's from the standard setters and it makes sense. You've also seen sort of movement in new York around proof of reserves. Certain jurisdictions are sort of starting to talk about it, but that's a patchwork problem for issuers. It's a little bit directionally helpful, but doesn't really solve the problem in a broad enough way. So very excited about the work we're doing there. Hopefully we have some news on that, but basically previewing it, I think what we'll see is that real time, a test or sort of real time proving of reserves generally becomes a baseline standard, especially for centralized, fiat backed stablecoins.
00:29:18.190 - 00:29:36.242, Speaker D: The other kind of product initiatives we're working on, we like building software within an accounting firm. It's kind of a startup feel. It's a lot of fun. I think we've been pretty good at it, better than I expected, actually. So we'll continue doing some of that. One of them is just from a business perspective, right. Sell what you've already built.
00:29:36.242 - 00:30:26.674, Speaker D: And so we have a great pipeline of very interesting clients and issuers that will come on over the next few months. And some of these are interesting plays, like an index token, additional stablecoins with varying sort of models and other tokenized issuers. Max mentioned carbon credits, right. Sort of an evolving space where these things are sort of illiquid, sort of opaque, and a tokenized model for them really creates a very compelling sort of access to them and transparency to them. So the other thing that we're doing, maybe it's a little less exciting in a way too. It's exciting to me, but Arminino has developed a pretty proprietary tool know, frankly, it's hard to do a large exchange audit, right. We used to audit coinbase, binance, us, FTX, us, our audit clients.
00:30:26.674 - 00:31:22.866, Speaker D: These are complex operations, right. And so we've developed signature tools, blockchain explorers of our own. We host all of the networks, host our own nodes to do this work. And so that tool set has been disparate, right. It's been kind of this back office stuff that we use. We're productizing and pulling that together, and we think that there'll be a very cool opportunity to sort of make this tool set open source to people, freely accessible, a freemium sort of model, right, where the community can have access to a block explorer that isn't just point in time and isn't sort of operated by who knows who or just an early community block explorer, but that has been sort of built and tested for really financial assurance use cases and has some of the key tools that are required, again, like digital signatures to prove rights and obligations or ownership over a given wallet or digital assets. And so that's compelling.
00:31:22.866 - 00:31:39.370, Speaker D: I think there'll be also an accounting firm model for that too, because I don't know if you guys know, but there's basically five accounting firms roughly that kind of know how to do any of the really important work in this space. Again, I hope that there are more. I hope that that develops because it's a key component of this market.
00:31:39.440 - 00:31:39.674, Speaker B: Right?
00:31:39.712 - 00:32:07.314, Speaker D: Like the companies that you guys are founding and working for need these services, frankly. And so there needs to be more players here. But it won't always be that those few accounting firms do the largest of test work or the exchange audits. It will be an open marketplace and there'll be other players. And so we think that tool set can actually allow more auditors to do more work. There's one more thing we're working on, which is kind of a tweak to the technology we already have, which is this real time ability.
00:32:07.362 - 00:32:07.574, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:07.612 - 00:32:44.580, Speaker D: So host nodes yourself be able to query data on that side, be able to build APIs to financial institutions and custodians and do real time transparency. We think that there's a great application of that in the capital markets and private fund space, or crypto funds specifically, especially the complex ones that use DeFi and move quickly. These asset managers need to be able to strike a Nav, as they say, or net asset value on the asset holdings. And we kind of have all the tools to do it. It's just about reordering it into an application that those managers and fund administrators want to use and can rely on.
00:32:45.830 - 00:33:26.490, Speaker B: And I would say with sort of three big product lines are stablecoins, a bunch of institutional services, and then now $2 billion originations, deep lending protocol. It's a long list. I'm going to try to keep it concise here. I would say on the stablecoin side, integrations are always key. The probably biggest one that we're excited about is jumping back into the Makerdao supply side. We've been long term partners there, and we're just about to jump back in to be another supporting asset to maintaining their peg on DAi. And then we're also going to do a lot to improve the liquidity on ramp and off ramps these days, wires are the primary way we go in and out of the asset, but we're doing a lot to improve to USD as an on ramp and off ramp.
00:33:26.490 - 00:34:22.922, Speaker B: So you'll see a lot of infrastructure improvements there. To jump over to our lending side and go back to your earlier question of where will we see tokenization next. The thesis that we have is that tokenization is not so much necessarily going to quickly improve in assets that are effectively atoms trying to move over to bits, because the collections on these assets, the provability of that asset's quality and value, are a little hard to maintain. Where we see liquidity flying in is around lending books, and we are going to do a lot around tokenizing real world lending effectively with the lending protocol. We've already brought lending in emerging markets, lending in fintechs, in let am, and even crypto mortgages in Austin through Truefi. And we're doing a lot to improve the composability of these portfolios and these loans. So you might see, say, a urine vault that includes a 20% allocation to real world lending through TrueFi portfolios.
00:34:22.922 - 00:34:53.146, Speaker B: So that's something we're doing on the infrastructure side, and then we're doing a lot more to improve institutional adoption of lending, which will hopefully get inflows through family offices and what have you into some of these assets. With the launch of things like tranching, capital formation periods, improved reporting, and as far as improving Defi liquidity, stablecoins remain a key building block. But we also expect unsecured lending protocols like Trufi to be sort of the next big building block to hopefully making this a multi trillion dollar industry. And it's a multi billion dollar one.
00:34:53.328 - 00:34:55.126, Speaker D: Can I make one more quick point, Matthew?
00:34:55.238 - 00:34:55.466, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:55.488 - 00:35:47.014, Speaker D: So one thing that we're definitely working on that I was remiss to not mention is more proof of reserves on chain, right? And just to contextualize this real quick, so what we do for trust token, for the true USD asset specifically is one part of it is data aggregation, right? Four different blockchains that they mint tokens on, and about seven different custodians where they hold cash, right? Bringing those things together allows us to one do a simple data reconciliation. But then on top of that, build attest reporting, again under recognized AICPA standards, you guys can all go click the button on trust Explorer right now and get an attest report that's again 30 seconds old, as Michael said. Now we take that, what we call sort of trusted data, right? It's been put through probably more than just it's been put through some rigor.
00:35:47.062 - 00:35:47.274, Speaker A: Right?
00:35:47.312 - 00:36:13.218, Speaker D: I guess is what you could say. And then it's fed on chain. So we do a lot on the attest side. It's frankly a little bit expensive and laborious. There's things that we do behind the scenes that aren't automated to make sure that we are meeting the standards. But next tail end of this year, we're open for business, I guess you could say. Right now what we're doing is what we call sort of non attest por, right, which is simply serving the data aggregation problem, right.
00:36:13.218 - 00:36:56.962, Speaker D: There are simple use cases where you can say one token on chain and sort of one custodian or one asset that backs it up, right. But that's usually not the case. It's actually usually multi chain or multi custodian. And so there's a simple sort of way to do this, which is aggregate the data and then build a connector, work with Chainlink, and provide this data on chain, which is deflationary compared to sort of the attest model, right. It's certainly lower cost and lighter weight. And so what we'll give to issuers on that side is essentially what we call control panel, but is a GUI for that same information. Right? So granular access point in time data, sort of the historical record of all the data points.
00:36:56.962 - 00:37:25.494, Speaker D: So it would be the custodian data points and the on chain data points. So looking forward to doing that, I think that it's necessary because proof of reserves on chain is just a different problem than sort of price aggregation on chain or price feeds on chain. Right. Where you've got many sources of truth that need to be sort of weighted and measured or averaged to get a secure, as chainlink says, or reliable, complete, accurate, timely, as the auditors would say, price feed.
00:37:25.542 - 00:37:25.706, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:25.728 - 00:37:42.554, Speaker D: And so it's really security comes from the decentralization, right. The multi node operators aggregating that price and providing it in these tokenized and proof of reserves use cases. It's just a different problem because you usually have a single source of confidential data that is the source of truth.
00:37:42.602 - 00:37:42.778, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:42.804 - 00:38:12.886, Speaker D: Which is the bank account or the custodian. Right. And so to provide security there or reliability or accuracy, complete, accurate, timely information, I think that there needs to be some middleware. It might not be that way forever, but there needs to be some data aggregation and middleware. And so we're tooling ourselves up to be able to do that at volume, at scale, I guess you could say, and looking forward to, I hope that that will be a solid pipeline for more proof of reserves on chain.
00:38:12.918 - 00:38:13.066, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:13.088 - 00:38:19.820, Speaker D: So more protocols can benefit from that, more issuers can benefit from that, and the space moves forward.
00:38:20.350 - 00:38:44.334, Speaker A: Great. Well, I think to tie things up, asset issuers like yourselves are a cornerstone of blockchain, bringing new assets on chain. But one of the core pillars of blockchain is transparency and security. And it's nice to see asset issuers taking that to heart, and especially you guys leading the space in terms of real time transparency on chain. So I want to thank you all for joining us today. Thank the audience and those tuning in, virtually. Pleasure to have you guys.
00:38:44.372 - 00:38:54.770, Speaker C: Thank you, guys. It's.
