00:00:00.090 - 00:01:09.886, Speaker A: I think for us, what we are super excited about is the fact that Chainlink was able to build this bridge between traditional finance and crypto to be connected with data, because blockchains are not naturally compatible with real data, whether it's like stock data or even the proof of reserves of a fund. And I think the technology is quite unique for us to have that globally accessible to a public ledger like Etheriam, so that we can read any kind of data. And that's really what Chanlink does. They were able to secure billions of dollars in value, trillions of dollars, settled as well, on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. And as such, this technology can be used for any kind of data, including our bitcoin reserves for our spot bitcoin ETF. And as such, we came up with this fantastic partnership so that anyone in the world with an Internet connection can see our bitcoin reserves in real time, available on the FM blockchain, the world's largest smart contracts platform, so that anyone can see, finally in real time, the bitcoin reserves. And for specific reasons.
00:01:09.886 - 00:01:40.540, Speaker A: Of course, we do not share our wallet addresses for security and of course, some attacks that can happen on several wallets. Such the solution with Chainlink is the perfect fit for us to enable anyone with a transparent way to read our bitcoin reserves in real time. And this is really fantastic. None of that would be possible without the amazing teams that we have at 21 shares, and of course, the collaboration that we have with ARC and the fantastic partnership that we had so far with the Channing team.
