00:00:00.570 - 00:01:24.360, Speaker A: The final thing that we're doing, in addition to providing the technology and creating proper incentive alignment without conflicts of interest, is we're generating an interface for capital markets and banks to properly interact with blockchains very efficiently. So my very strong belief is that as long as we can keep the technology conflict of interest free, secure and hyper reliable, and we can continue to grow it in a sustainable, economically justifiable way, so that the costs expended by it grow with the security it provides, and that it continues to provide security at larger and larger scale capital markets participants, namely banks that have trillions of dollars, will continue to use it more and more. We've already seen people make stablecoins from banks. Large banks actually create their own stablecoins and put them onto chains. And we've seen more and more of them start to talk with us about building more advanced applications. We are working with an increasingly larger amount of banks, and some of the things I'm seeing there suggest to me that things will move beyond a proof of concept into a pilot and into production. And just to be clear on what it moving into production means, banks have trillions of dollars.
00:01:24.360 - 00:02:05.620, Speaker A: So if our industry is going to grow, yes, it can grow from prop traders and institutions and whoever wanting to use it, but it really does need large institutions to decide to become part of it, because it's a superior system. And for us to do that, for that to happen, we need it to be a superior system. So the final thing that we're doing is working with large capital markets institutions to enable them to access these conflict of interest free, reliable and tamper proof alternatives, and offer them to their clients in large volume and in a usable way.
