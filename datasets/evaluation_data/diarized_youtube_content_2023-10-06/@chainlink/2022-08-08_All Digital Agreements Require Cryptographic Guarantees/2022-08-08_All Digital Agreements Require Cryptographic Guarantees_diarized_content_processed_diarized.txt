00:00:02.250 - 00:00:14.394, Speaker A: Why has the world shifted from sending the craziest things over unencrypted channels to the average user wanting to use endtoend.
00:00:14.442 - 00:00:18.400, Speaker B: Encrypted messaging systems like telegram signal and others?
00:00:19.570 - 00:00:22.526, Speaker A: Well, it's because the institutions, whether they.
00:00:22.548 - 00:00:26.934, Speaker B: Were larger technology institutions, governmental institutions, or.
00:00:26.972 - 00:00:36.546, Speaker C: Technology platform institutions in the form of web two, failed. They failed their users, and those users.
00:00:36.658 - 00:00:38.202, Speaker A: Lost faith in them.
00:00:38.336 - 00:00:42.154, Speaker B: As a technology provider for communications, it.
00:00:42.192 - 00:00:51.374, Speaker A: Was no longer acceptable for users to simply say, oh, it's a big telecom, it's safe, or, oh, don't worry about it.
00:00:51.412 - 00:00:55.294, Speaker D: Nothing can ever go wrong if the government decides to look into every single.
00:00:55.332 - 00:01:06.050, Speaker C: Message you ever sent, or any number of other kind of very vague, brand based, paper based guarantees.
00:01:07.670 - 00:01:11.026, Speaker A: Those guarantees fell away because of things.
00:01:11.048 - 00:01:13.486, Speaker D: Like Cambridge Analytica, because of the misuse.
00:01:13.518 - 00:01:18.054, Speaker B: Of various assumptions that users had about the privacy of their messaging data, and.
00:01:18.092 - 00:01:20.002, Speaker D: Because of many, many cases where telecoms.
00:01:20.066 - 00:01:23.000, Speaker C: Didn'T deliver the security and privacy that they promised it.
00:01:23.770 - 00:01:30.698, Speaker A: But how was faith for users and for the general public restored when it.
00:01:30.704 - 00:01:34.810, Speaker B: Came to communications and basic text messaging capabilities?
00:01:35.310 - 00:01:39.930, Speaker C: It was encryption, which is a form of cryptographic guarantee.
00:01:41.010 - 00:01:43.198, Speaker A: This proves to me, even in a.
00:01:43.204 - 00:01:46.238, Speaker C: Very near term way, that the difference.
00:01:46.324 - 00:01:48.666, Speaker B: Between a paper promise and a cryptographic.
00:01:48.698 - 00:02:00.250, Speaker A: Guarantee is extremely valuable and highly valued by users once they understand what that guarantee is in the form of messaging.
00:02:00.410 - 00:02:02.814, Speaker D: That guarantee has become widely understood as.
00:02:02.852 - 00:02:04.554, Speaker B: End to end encrypted messaging.
00:02:04.682 - 00:02:06.086, Speaker A: And the lack of end to end.
00:02:06.108 - 00:02:18.230, Speaker B: Encrypted messaging is no longer a reasonable standard. The new minimum standard is end to end encrypted messaging, whether it's on WhatsApp or signal, or telegram, or any number of other capabilities.
00:02:19.850 - 00:02:22.742, Speaker A: This is what I predict will happen.
00:02:22.796 - 00:02:23.780, Speaker B: To the rest of the world.
