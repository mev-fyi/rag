00:00:39.730 - 00:01:14.178, Speaker A: Without any further ado, let me introduce our panelists. We have Bret Shearer from the Palm Tree group. We have big round of applause. We have Coop Berturley, Koopa Troopa, and we have Naomi, aka Mark Johns. Big panel for us. Just want to thank you guys again for coming out tonight and very excited to get this started. So just to start off the panel, I guess, let's start with what is a music NFt? Happy to start with.
00:01:14.178 - 00:01:18.230, Speaker A: You want to. Guys want to go left to right or jump in? Start with Bret.
00:01:19.130 - 00:02:04.914, Speaker B: All right, I guess we'll jump right in. Yeah. I mean, to me, a music Nft is essentially valuing music as if it's a piece of art. So it's like looking at music same way we're used to looking at collecting art. We've seen crypto art for years now, where digital artists now have a way to distribute their art in the form of NFTs and have it kind of valued directly by collectors. That narrative is very familiar for physical artists already. So being able to bridge that to kind of visual art and now give music the classification of it is art, obviously, but also giving it that ability to be valued directly as art.
00:02:04.914 - 00:02:09.490, Speaker B: So it's kind of like being able to collect music in the form of art directly.
00:02:10.630 - 00:02:21.500, Speaker C: Nice. Yeah, I'd follow on to that. Just say that it's a tokenized song in the same way that we have vinyl, NFTs allow us to make digital vinyls now. And having a collectible version of music allows us to make a secondary market in a way that we haven't really seen before.
00:02:23.870 - 00:02:43.700, Speaker D: Music nfts, I look at them as collectibles. I feel like if you are a stan of music in general, if you're a stan of any artist, that's a way for you kind of demonstrate that that has not existed before this little era. So I think that's special for both artists and the fans as well.
00:02:47.190 - 00:03:05.366, Speaker A: The important question I skipped over was to introduce yourself and explain how you got into web3 and how you are related to music NFTs that give us some more context. So sorry. I do apologize for that. I got excited. Bret, if you want to share your experience with web3, that'd be great.
00:03:05.548 - 00:03:33.034, Speaker B: I think it was a great start. Get right down to it. Yeah. My name is Bret. I go by blockchain Bret on Twitter. And I started off in the crypto space in 2016, working at consensus building products, the Ethereum shop, and then I co founded a company called Fleek, which is a developer platform. And I've been collecting NFTs since early 2018.
00:03:33.034 - 00:03:50.390, Speaker B: Started off with, like, crypto art and a bunch of other types of NFTs. And more recently, I am a partner at Palm Tree Crew Crypto, which is a venture fund focused on the creator economy. Crypto creator economy. And I'm a big music NFT collector.
00:03:51.770 - 00:04:09.414, Speaker C: Love that. Yeah, me and Blockchain b have a nice rival going on sound collecting a lot of music nfts, so it's a good time. Hey, guys, I'm Cooper. I am an operator investor in the creator economy. I work with founders to build products for creators. Getting into web3. Prior to crypto, I was into music, and so I was a curator for a blog called this song is Sick.
00:04:09.414 - 00:04:28.500, Speaker C: I was a journalist and an artist manager, graduated with a music business degree. And so for a long time, my life was two worlds. It was music as a passion and crypto as a profession. But now, finally with music nfts, I've found a way to really meld those together. So I'm really excited about it. I'm an investor in a lot of the music NFT platforms that, you know, today, collecting and then helping as many creators get on board as possible.
00:04:30.150 - 00:05:03.210, Speaker D: Let's go. Hi, guys. My name is Naomi. I've been working in music under the name Mark Johns for the last six years or so. I've kind of moved throughout the music industry in different capacities. I guess between artists, songwriter, a r creative, it's just all over. And when the pandemic started, we kind of started doing these Zoom sessions that I found very counterproductive to the process of making art in general.
00:05:03.210 - 00:05:27.710, Speaker D: It just didn't make sense to me, so I took a little bit of a step back. I started working at a bar. I was a bartender for a little bit, and that's when I learned about just the actual foundation of what the blockchain is. And I was like, all right, cool. This is inevitable. This is a financial system that is already in place that is ready to take over what's going on. Everything else will follow.
00:05:27.710 - 00:05:41.320, Speaker D: It's just a matter of time. How do I align my interests with what's going on in this world, and how do I make a contribution that makes a difference? I guess. And that's what I've been focusing on in the last little bit.
00:05:42.010 - 00:05:58.394, Speaker C: I love that. I'll just echo know Naomi and our friends from LA. I remember when I went to one of my very first house parties there. I was talking to her. I was like, hey, I do crypto. And she's like, that sounds cool. And I remember just thinking like, I was crazy because, no, there's this book how the Internet happened, and now crypto is coming about and stuff like that, and I just want to give her a huge cosign.
00:05:58.394 - 00:06:15.960, Speaker C: She runs something called Friday Night Dinner in Los Angeles. It's an event for creators to come together and ask questions in a very comfortable environment. I've been lucky to attend a few of them, but they're really, really fantastic. And now she's on sound, dropping a lot of music nfts, and the progression has really just been incredible to watch so far and a lot to go.
00:06:18.090 - 00:06:36.060, Speaker A: Cool. Well, on that topic, how do you feel that music NFTs are going to interact with the current system in terms of publishing agencies, management groups? How do you think the music NFT world is going to disrupt that? And maybe how can you guys work together with them to make it possible?
00:06:38.110 - 00:07:28.090, Speaker B: All right. Yeah, I think it's a bit of a different space right now. It's kind of like an area where mostly where independent artists can kind of take advantage of it and excel in a new area. So pretty much if you're an independent artist and you're starting to make music now, you should be looking at music nfts first and foremost as an avenue to release your music. And it's probably a better path than going directly to maybe label paths or directly to Spotify. So, yeah, I think it's kind of that to start, but there's a lot of opportunity for musicians that are already signed with labels, et cetera, to be able to kind of figure out their path into it. So I think it's coming from both sides.
00:07:29.150 - 00:08:12.998, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this is the biggest question for music NFT success. Is there a world where we can actually work cohesively with the existing system, with publishers and with agents? Right now, I see music nfts as a new revenue stream very similar to digital merchandise. So in the same way you're selling t shirts or you're selling vinyl records, this is kind of the analog we're making today. And I think it gets interesting because you now have a consumption layer where you can play the music NFT. I have all these different people that were involved with the creation of it, from the artists itself to the person making the COVID art to a songwriter to a producer. And so really challenging when you sell a music NFT, what does that look like? How do we treat that from a rights perspective? I'll be the first to say I don't think any of us have that fully figured out yet. But it's been really exciting to watch independent artists just taking that first leap of faith and kind of curating this environment, this community that we all know and love today.
00:08:12.998 - 00:08:39.140, Speaker C: And over time, I believe that publishers and labels will come in and provide a service role in the same way they do today. Whether it's a distribution role to help you get on something like sound or catalog, whether it's a collection type thing, or whether it's just a community building thing to help you moderate your discord, there's a lot of roles that artists are having to play right now outside of making the art. And I think the biggest thing that I'm excited for service providers to come out and do is let the artists make the art that they do the best and allow them to take care of all the business things that right now, a lot of independent artists are handling themselves.
00:08:41.030 - 00:09:14.190, Speaker D: That part I come from, like, a little bit of a weird background, I guess, where I started in the music industry as an artist, specifically, and I started as an artist before I'd ever done a show before. I'd never performed. I'd never done the on stage thing. And it turns out I don't like that too much. It's not for me. And while that is definitely for some people, for some people, it comes naturally for some people, that's what they're born to do. It just wasn't the fit for me.
00:09:14.190 - 00:10:26.500, Speaker D: And to be told by everyone around me that the only way that you can succeed as an artist is to tour, because that's where you make your money, that's where you make your living, was a little bit discouraging. I had to reassess my position in the industry 100%. And when I came to learn about web3 and the opportunities that it gave to artists within the space, I was like, all right, cool. This is a private patronage model that works for an artist like me, who is not looking to connect to millions and millions of people at a time, but rather just to connect with somebody and have my art be felt by someone. And I think that there's a lot of artists like that, and it's a little bit insane to expect every musician to be a performer and to expect every performer to be a musician, the same way that it's a little bit crazy to expect every DJ to be a producer and every producer to be a DJ, because they're two different things, and you can have strengths in both. And I just feel like this world kind of gave me an opportunity to exist in the space where I have the most strength and where I have something to contribute as opposed to just struggling to kind of break through. Does that make sense?
00:10:28.150 - 00:10:28.466, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:28.488 - 00:11:15.874, Speaker C: And I want to stick on that point for a second because I think patronage is such a key word here to focus on for music nfts. As you alluded to, people ask me all the time, why are you buying these music nfts? What's the value of them? Do they have ownership rights associated with it? But as someone who's been a fan of music for a long time, I really value a relationship with the creator prior to music NFT, there wasn't really a great way for me to say, like, I really like this song, or I really want to have a deeper relationship with you as a creator. And so being able to collect a song, come to a discord and have a one on one conversation, it's really, really unique. I think we're in a very lucky phase right now. If you are a big music NFT collector, you have a very high likelihood of getting to know your favorite artists on a deeply personal level. I don't think that's going to scale broadly, but I do think there's an opportunity for fans to show I really want to be involved in these specific communities. I really care about getting to know this creator, and more importantly, I care about getting to know the fans of this creator's community.
00:11:15.874 - 00:11:17.620, Speaker C: So it's not only about that.
00:11:18.090 - 00:11:49.520, Speaker D: If anything, it'll diminish over time. Like, as it continues to scale and as more artists continue to join the scene and as more fans continue to understand what all of this means, that connection slowly starts to dissipate. And so I think that every artist that is choosing to participate in the scene as of right now, and every fan that is choosing to engage with those artists that are participating are reaping the rewards of just being early. And I think there's a lot to be said for that. So thank you all for being here.
00:11:51.570 - 00:12:51.010, Speaker B: Yeah, and I'll add to that, too. I think when it comes down to music, like, a lot of the revenue for these different artists, usually, majority of it comes from touring, which is kind of a crazy concept, if you think about it. They should be making most of their money off the art they create themselves, right? The music they make is their art, and that should be where they're monetizing for the most part. There's obviously artists that do really well, but even if you look at their income and their revenue, it's way more from touring than it is from streaming, they can definitely still make a lot from streaming, but that's the top, top percent, right? So, yeah, I think in this world where you can have your art monetized directly, touring can become something more of like an additional plus. Something you do for fun, something you do for the love, for bringing your community together. And you can really kind of just focus on creating the art and people appreciating your art directly.
00:12:52.550 - 00:13:08.920, Speaker A: Very well said. So in terms, though, of the live experience, I go shows all the time. How do you guys think that music NFTs can enhance that experience itself? Like, is there something we can bet in shows, concerts, tickets? What are your thoughts around NFTs at the actual shows themselves?
00:13:10.730 - 00:13:12.054, Speaker B: Cooper, you want to hit this?
00:13:12.172 - 00:13:32.894, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. I'll take a first stab at it. I think that every artist will eventually have some free NFT to claim for coming to the show in the same way that you have a concert ticket that you save. When I would go to festivals, I would save my wristbands and save my concert stubs. I think that giving people free poops for attending a show is a really, really great way just to build a social graph. Right now, we're in a world where if you want to buy a music NFt, you have to shell out a couple hundred dollars.
00:13:32.894 - 00:13:55.986, Speaker C: And that just does not scale to the average fan of most artists. And so right now, I think the simplest thing is just to give people an attendance token saying, thank you for coming. But as me and Bret can attest to, when you hear your song, the owners of music Nft live at a show, it hits very different. There's the meme of the guy in the corner and it's like they don't know. I own this music NFt. But it's real. It's a very visceral feeling.
00:13:55.986 - 00:14:13.680, Speaker C: And so I think that the way that they're going to interact moving forward is that if you are an artist that has music, ten of T's available, there's a distribution layer to give people free NFTs for coming. And then if someone does own your music Nft, I think there's going to be a personal relationship with that collector. And so what that looks like, I think is still TBD, but I see it happening very fast.
00:14:14.770 - 00:15:05.050, Speaker D: I think it's beneficial for the artist. I think it's important to know who's coming to your shows and how to connect with those people and how to kind of create that connection between your shows. Like, as an artist right now, you can do a tour across the whole 50 states of the country and not have any idea who those people are, how to connect with them again, how to reach out to them again, to let them know that you're doing another tour, to let them know that you're releasing another song, to let them know how to participate in your growth as an artist. And I think that there's definitely an opportunity for all these ticketing companies to really participate in the situation, venues to participate in the situation. And for artists to kind of make that executive decision that they want to include this technology in how they interact with their fans, that's really what it comes down to.
00:15:05.200 - 00:15:45.850, Speaker C: I'll add one more quick thought here. So the reason why music nfts clicked so easily for me is I used to be really into hat pin culture in music. So artists like pretty Lights and jam bands like sts Nine, there was this huge culture around enamels that had nothing with them except for a social currency amongst the fans in that community. And so when I was going to the show, you would give your hat to someone, they would look at your collection and whatnot. And it became so obvious to me that there are social dynamics that happen at IRL events. And so in the same way with music nfts, I think eventually we'll get to a state where you can open your wallet and show that you have different song NFTs, you have different pops from different shows. And I think we'll start to see this superfan gamification system where you can notice who the biggest fan of this artist is live as per the assets that they hold in their wallet.
00:15:47.390 - 00:16:50.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that something that will be cool over time is all these artists that are releasing their music as NFTs are starting to build a community around their art directly. It's a group of holders. So there's a lot of topic, a lot of talk around membership nfts. How do you create utility or access around it? And I think what's happening kind of low key is every single one of these artists that's releasing music NFTs is actually building their membership. Like it's building their community. So once maybe they get to the level, or if they decide they want to take it to touring or to shows or to different types of festivals, I think there will be ways for these artists to kind of bake in their NFTs that already exist with their existing fan base and provide additional experiences, access to certain areas in the festival, or maybe it's backstage. And then if you can show it off, maybe we get some Google AR glasses out there we can see who has what.
00:16:50.398 - 00:16:52.400, Speaker B: That'd be kind of nice for sure.
00:16:53.250 - 00:17:26.540, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. That's how I envision it. Get 100 NFTs, you get backstage, you get 1000 NFTs, you get like special all access, whatever in the booth. Once in your lifetime, everybody's dream always to be in the DJ booth. But Naomi, not as a touring artist. But if you were an artist, would you be embarrassed if I came up to you and tried to show you my po app and said, like, I was the first one at your show and you wouldn't did. I will embarrassingly say I did go up to Cooper at the Tyco show and I got a PO app that proved I saw him at the Tyco show.
00:17:26.540 - 00:17:48.020, Speaker A: That's good. And I did not know you worked for that song. That's like a poop of the people who were in the beginning who are looking for the good remixes. So, yeah, always trying. Doesn't matter anyways. If you have no music nfts in the room and you want to get into music NFTs, where would you guys recommend the first place to look or start is?
00:17:49.990 - 00:18:17.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess it depends. If you have no other NFTs and you're just kind of getting started and you want something like kind of small to get going. I think the price point is probably a little high, to be honest. But if you go to sound, I would say that's probably the lower end of the price point. I mean, you can get an addition for 0.1 E. It's not like that cheap.
00:18:17.074 - 00:18:34.400, Speaker B: But you're buying music, though. It's worth something. It's worth something. Yeah, I think that's a pretty good place to start. There's definitely more options of platforms, but that's probably the most democratic access.
00:18:35.410 - 00:19:02.930, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say there's a social dynamic and a financial dynamic. So if you're getting started today, I think it's important that you surround yourself with other people that know what they're talking about in the space. And so there's communities like Songcamp, water, and music that are doing fantastic job. FWB has a really amazing music community. And then on the collecting side, if you're getting started with a credit card, Royal is a fantastic place to get started. You can just buy with a credit card at $100 and get a taste for what's happening. And as you go deeper down that rabbit hole, as Bret alluded to sound, XYZ has drops every day from up and coming artists.
00:19:02.930 - 00:19:25.780, Speaker C: It's where I'm the biggest collector right now, like, spending most of my ETH, and I'm really excited about that. And then catalog is also a fantastic marketplace for more intimate relationships. So if you're buying an NFT on catalog, it's a one of one. And as I alluded to earlier, with patronage, if you're collecting a record from an artist on catalog, there's a really, really high likelihood that you can have a direct conversation with them and get to know what they're working on. So those are some things I'd recommend, but curious to hear what you have to say, too.
00:19:26.150 - 00:20:06.686, Speaker D: I mean, you named all of them, but all right, ain't no thing I would mint songs. We love mint songs. They've been doing a bunch of events over the last week with a chill pill that have been really fun to participate in. I just think that's a cool little avenue for just music creation and distribution in general. Royal is a great point of participation if you're looking for something that is affordable, if that makes sense, I would say sound is a little bit more intimate. It's a more limited collection of editions, but again, more affordable. And then there's catalog, which is the one of one.
00:20:06.686 - 00:20:26.770, Speaker D: And I guess the real goal of all of this is to kind of get it to a point where anybody feels like they can participate at any level, at any income level or whatever it is. We don't want barriers, you know what I mean? I think that's the end goal, but it's so early that everything that's happening right now is necessary.
00:20:27.190 - 00:20:49.290, Speaker C: I guess this may feel like an obvious point, too, but listen to the music and try and find something that you love. I think right now it's easy to just buy artists because there's like a name and they're performing well, but just going and browsing sound explorer page or catalog and just, like, listening to find an artist that you love, you're going to get way more out of that connection when you collect a song that you have a relationship with rather than trying to buy it just to make a profit.
00:20:50.110 - 00:21:04.610, Speaker B: Yeah. Plus one, plus one, plus 100. Yeah. Going to the platforms first. And just like listening to every single artist. Also just click on the artists, click on their Twitter, see what they've been doing before. Check out the collectors, too, see what else they've collected.
00:21:04.610 - 00:21:16.120, Speaker B: Yeah. Also follow everyone on Twitter, see what they're tweeting. And yeah, I think that's the best way to learn about the space and listen to all the music for sure.
00:21:17.370 - 00:21:54.270, Speaker A: Definitely. This does remind me early soundcloud stages in many ways until they removed all the content because of obvious reasons. But the way I would go about finding music is like, what's the most popular song in Brazil? And then what's the most popular song in Ukraine? And then from there you follow influencers, and then you go down different wormholes, find different NFTs, and that helps you discover people that are just not on the top ten every day. Besides my recommendations on how to find music, what are you guys most excited about right now for music nfts in general, period?
00:21:58.050 - 00:21:59.630, Speaker B: I'll let you start. Cooper.
00:22:00.130 - 00:22:28.870, Speaker C: I'm really excited for the era of custom contracts. I think there's a lot of artists that are going to start graduating post platform now. Everyone's in a stage with music NFTs where they're dropping on catalog or sound. We're going to start to see that some of the artists that have done well there are going to take this to the next level. That means bigger drops, more additions, more rarities with it, more collecting games, and I'm excited. Over the next three to six months, I think we're going to really see an inflection point because it's going to go from 25 additions on sound to there being 1000 NFTs at different rarities and price points. I think that's going to open up a very big secondary market.
00:22:28.870 - 00:22:37.280, Speaker C: There's a lot of amazing people who are helping these artists build really, really amazing sites. And I think that maturity level is going to take the sector to a space that we haven't really seen before.
00:22:39.890 - 00:23:25.358, Speaker D: Shout out Chainlink. I'm freezing. So cold up here. I would say the thing that I'm most excited for is the leverage that it gives to writers and to artists. This ecosystem that now exists is one where publishers, major labels, all these people that have kind of held the Ace card for the last 2030 years now really have to trust the artists that they're working with and the writers that they're working with to account to them in a proper way, the same way that they account to the artists. And I think that offers the artists and the writers a lot of leverage that has not existed before in this industry. I think that's important and there needs to be a mutual trust, and I just don't think that's existed before.
00:23:25.358 - 00:23:29.760, Speaker D: And this is offering a system in which that can take place.
00:23:34.690 - 00:24:32.162, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm excited about, I think the creative, if we're going to like high level stuff, I think the creative freedom is the most exciting aspect. It's just like creators come in, they do whatever they want. They release where they want, they release on multiple platforms. They don't give up any control, they don't give up any platform specific relationships, and they release whenever they want and connect with whoever they want. It's a much more beautiful world for the artist, but also in kind of a more specific type of topic. I think that an exciting area that I want to see unfold is in the kind of NFT scene already. There's the concept of CCO, where in a board ape, you can have an NFT and you have the commercial right to NFT, but then there's CCO projects like nouns or Toads, et cetera, where now the project itself is the platform.
00:24:32.162 - 00:24:59.690, Speaker B: And I think that if artists in the NFT space can really push the barrier on that, and they might find that an artist themselves can also become a platform and that anyone will be able to do whatever they want and with their music or with kind of taking the artists into more projects, into more levels. And I think that will return, will become super powerful for every artist involved.
00:25:01.310 - 00:25:21.666, Speaker A: Absolutely. Creative freedom. The people are the first and last dance floor will finally get the credit, and so will the artists. So I think that's good for the questions. Unless you guys have anything you want to add. We can save a little bit of time for Q A if we have any questions. All right, so I saw this hand first.
00:25:21.666 - 00:25:27.540, Speaker A: I only have one microphone, so I'll bring it over to you to ask. No, it's okay.
00:25:29.910 - 00:25:59.070, Speaker E: Perfect. Hey, thank you so much. My question is kind of regarding the music industry. I think you kind of touched on it that the artists really are taking advantage by the people in power right now, and only select few really can break through and write their own contracts. But for the average person, Spotify is a very apple music. Stuff like that is still going to be around. And so I was just kind of interested what you see unfolding there in the future and how that will help for the person.
00:25:59.070 - 00:26:08.820, Speaker E: Not so much. Not so much involved. Just enjoys music, loves finding out new things. But these are now going to be private, potentially. So just your thoughts in the general industry of evolution there.
00:26:11.990 - 00:26:13.460, Speaker A: Would like to take it.
00:26:15.270 - 00:26:34.690, Speaker C: It's a great question. I think that all music NFTs should be distributed on major DSPs. So if there is a music NFT, you should have it on Spotify. It should be on YouTube. But I think the larger trend here is eventually, I believe that all music will be free to listen and valuable to own. So right now, artists are getting paid a fraction of a penny for every stream that's happening. We've yet to find a global model for streaming that works for all parties involved.
00:26:34.690 - 00:26:51.870, Speaker C: So I think what's going to happen here is that people will distribute their music for free. To Bret's point about CCO, I can go and stream it very easily. Right now it's $10 a month to get every song in the world. I think eventually it'll be $0 to get every song in the world. But if you have a special relationship with that song, you can collect it as an NFT, and I think that's the way that the artists will be able to monetize.
00:26:54.390 - 00:26:55.380, Speaker B: Well said.
00:26:57.990 - 00:26:58.740, Speaker A: Saw.
00:27:01.750 - 00:27:25.290, Speaker F: Obviously we're seeing a lot of adoption from the big artists like Snoop Dogg, but as someone who has worked a lot with independent artists and talked to them and been one myself, we're not really seeing a lot of widespread adoption. There's like a negative connotation about. So, like, what could we do to remove the mystique around NFTs and also just that negative, just association with them from the indie community specifically?
00:27:31.730 - 00:28:26.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess in the community that exists so far, it's like, it's such a positive thing. I think it's because everyone really appreciates the art and wants to be connected with the artists. All the reasons behind why we collect music, NFTs and stuff we've been talking about, I think it's stronger than any of the negative points. They are probably not looking and checking and seeing what's really going mean. I also. I think it's good to grow organically and natively at the same time. It's like, I love to see Snoop Dogg dropping and bringing the mass eyes to it, but it's a cool thing for artists that are maybe even smaller, like bringing the space up and growing with it and making it to what it is.
00:28:26.080 - 00:28:31.520, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's maybe not such a bad thing if it happens, not super quickly.
00:28:33.010 - 00:29:19.710, Speaker C: I think it's very accurate that right now NFTs have a very negative public sentiment. And I think the reason for that is that we focus far more on the speculative nature of it than the tangible utility of what you can do with it. And so to solve that, I think we need to get into a world where people are earning free NFTs for participation and they're able to use that to do things that enhance their everyday fan experience. So if that's getting pre sale tickets to a show discounted, know, we talk about this stuff a lot, but right now most people are only getting those benefits if they spent thousands of dollars on a one of one or on an NFT. And so I think it's a bigger problem just with the state of NFTs in know the average person will see an NFT by their favorite influencer posting a story post for an NFT product and then gets rugged two days later. It's like, as an industry, I think we need more case studies of independent artists who have really made a name for themselves through this technology. People like Daniel Allen or Oshi or Latasha, I think are all great examples of that.
00:29:19.710 - 00:29:28.980, Speaker C: And more broadly, I think it's less about getting the snoop doggs into the world and it's more about highlighting the people that actually use this technology to make a career for themselves and using that as the case study moving forward.
00:29:30.470 - 00:30:14.800, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think it's necessarily about the utility stuff of bringing through experiences or adding. I think all that stuff is awesome and it's amazing plus, but an ideal future is everyone just appreciating music and thinking it's valuable and wanting to collect it and be a part of the artist? I think people just need to get around that concept and it's going to be hard, especially for an industry veteran that is so used to the way that music goes through the system today. It's going to be really hard for someone to say, oh, yeah, music is valued like art. Like perfect one to one directly. That sounds great. Let's titch the whole thing. I think, yeah, it's going to have to happen in a more native way over time.
00:30:17.490 - 00:30:18.480, Speaker C: Anything else?
00:30:21.170 - 00:31:09.440, Speaker D: I think that for artists today, it's pretty messed up just in terms of what the label is actually offering to you. Oh, God, how do I articulate this? How do I explain this? I feel like the main difference is that if you are an artist signing to a label and they're coming to you with a list of expenses, right. This is a private company that has developed their relationships with these outsourced, whatever the fuck it is. Basically, as an artist, you're receiving the short end of the stick in terms of accounting every single time, regardless of your position entering the situation. I'm just going to give the microphone back because I lost my train of thought.
00:31:11.270 - 00:31:29.400, Speaker C: I have a good one to keep it going. Naomi, I'm really curious to hear, when you started hearing about nfts music, NFTs, et cetera, what was it that actually kind of clicked for you and what made you be like, yo, I want to start doing this now because obviously people in LA were talking about NFTs a ton. It was like public conversation. But what really tipped it over the line to make you want to start really diving in?
00:31:29.850 - 00:32:26.218, Speaker D: I was working as a bartender, and when I would put my tip into the computer, it would take three weeks from when I put my tip into the computer for me to see that tip in my bank account. And when I started learning about web3 and blockchain in general, it actually had nothing to do with music. I was more interested in the financial system, you know what I mean? That could kind of aggregate into all these industries as we move forward. And I was like, all right, this already exists. You've got people that are being paid with checks and you got people that are being paid with direct deposit. If you want to be paid with direct deposit and not have to wait that extra five days, you're demanding that from your employer. You know what I mean? So I think that we're going to get to a point where if the system already exists where I, as the employee, can get paid today for the work that I do today, I'm not going to want to wait another week.
00:32:26.218 - 00:32:48.478, Speaker D: That's up to you as the employer. If you want to hire me, you have to be competitive in the way that you pay your employees. And so that's an inevitable. I so happen to work in music. I so happen to love music. So that is where I kind of started my journey. But initially, I was just like, this is a financial system that is inevitable.
00:32:48.478 - 00:33:05.240, Speaker D: This will happen. This is going to take over the way that everything works today. How do I find a place in all this that I'm interested in, that I can offer something of value and just participate, I guess, is where I found myself a few months ago.
00:33:08.730 - 00:33:28.154, Speaker C: Yeah. What I'm hearing, though, that's really interesting, is most artists in web3 are very financially literate. Like, they're thinking about Web three, they're thinking about their finances. They're thinking about the economic value of these assets. And it's interesting to recognize that as an artist in Web three today, there is a necessity for you to think about how to price your NFTs. Think about how many you want to drop and where to drop them and whatnot. And it's a very new dynamic.
00:33:28.154 - 00:33:52.520, Speaker C: So I think the thing that Bret highlighted that I'd really love to echo is that utility isn't really necessary for music NFTs to have value. I think a lot of artists get caught up in, like, how can I deliver the best fan experience possible to try to justify the valuation of this. But I can definitely speak for myself, and I think for Bret too, that we're just collecting the music. If you were lease good music and you find a way to tokenize it to make a secondary market for it, there's a huge opportunity there. I think that's more than enough to get the conversation started.
00:33:53.770 - 00:33:54.760, Speaker B: Yes, sir.
00:33:55.770 - 00:34:04.630, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you, guys. Any more questions before? One more question and then one more. Here we go. Music nfts.
00:34:07.050 - 00:34:18.350, Speaker B: Yeah, you spoke about music NFT, owning music nfts. In terms of patronage, what kind of opportunities are there for continuing patronage with music nfts?
00:34:19.410 - 00:34:20.160, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:23.730 - 00:35:02.822, Speaker C: This is a really amazing question. If you think about the different dynamics of music nfts, you have one person who will collect one for $5 and one person who will collect it for $10,000. I think it's impossible to deliver the same experience. And so we think about discord servers and the way that we have tiered access today, we don't really have a great system for that. I think back to my earlier point, just allowing you to have a relationship with the other fans in that community is more important than worrying about how to have a relationship with that creator directly. And so I think patronage will change from I'm going to have a Facetime or a zoom with the creator to I'm going to have a social space for ten other people who also own this music NFT. And my job as a creator is to create environments where if I live in LA and someone lives in Miami, there's a high likelihood that we can have a connection together through music nfts.
00:35:02.822 - 00:35:07.790, Speaker C: And I think that's kind of the patronage is our shared love and of artists, rather than asking for the artist's time directly.
00:35:08.610 - 00:35:31.062, Speaker B: Yeah. Also, the artist should just keep releasing music. It's your career. You're going to keep releasing music. As you grow, you can create more additions, you can sell more. As your community grows, you create more nfts. I mean, it's not like you should necessarily limit the amount of music nfts you release for any reason other than however many you want to put out.
00:35:31.062 - 00:35:45.820, Speaker B: But naturally, you'll be able to release more as the next songs you release as your community grows and you can do more additions. I think probably the key thing for continued Patriot is continued making of music.
00:35:48.590 - 00:35:56.318, Speaker C: I want to tee up a softball here for you. The way you were talking about patronage with how you're thinking of doing music NFTs moving forward is fascinating. If you're open to sharing it, I.
00:35:56.324 - 00:36:44.462, Speaker D: Would love to yeah, for sure. I was going to say, look, as an artist, coming from a situation where people were paying at the most 1.29 per song, that was the highest price point for any song ever. And to be at a point where people are paying five figures for a song and everybody should be able to set the price point for their art, you as an artist should have that, right. You know what I mean? Everybody should be able to do that. But let's not pretend that the artist, while making the song, does not get the same satisfaction that the listener does from listening to it. Do you know what I mean? It's not like I'm giving and receiving nothing.
00:36:44.462 - 00:37:20.760, Speaker D: Do you know what I mean? So I think that that's why artists right now are looking to really deliver the most amount of utility as possible. Because when it comes down to it, in essence, we get the same feeling that you get from listening to the song, do you know what I mean? As we are making it. So I guess it just needs to kind of come to a point where everybody's benefiting, no one's being taken advantage of, and it's just working together so that everybody can continue to do what they're doing that makes them feel good. And I think that's the tea.
00:37:23.390 - 00:37:36.910, Speaker A: Very well said. I understand what you're talking. Guess if there's anybody else have any questions? I guess I have a question. We have a question over here. We did. I'm wrong. Awesome question.
00:37:36.910 - 00:37:59.060, Speaker A: Say I wanted to create a house music dao for all house musicians like Jamie Jones, Locodize Solomon, and they want the community to be involved and I have all the resources. But how would I go about starting it? How would I do a fair launch for a dao? A music dao. What would be your recommendation coming from.
00:37:59.910 - 00:38:01.910, Speaker B: Full time Daos Koopa troop?
00:38:03.690 - 00:38:28.190, Speaker C: I would say by start collecting one house NFT that people can get behind collectively and then just start snowballing that. So rather than trying to release music at first, I would say put three to five people in a group, identify an NFT you want to collect together, and then just start growing that outwards. I think over time you'll have a treasury of assets that have an underlying value that represents the ethos of that group. And from there you can start to bring in artists to release songs and distribute. But I can speak. Me and Bret have like a fun collector.
00:38:28.930 - 00:38:44.370, Speaker B: That's one really good way. Another really good way is to make a creative common where they can come together, make music together, and then release nfts songcamp that was deezdao or noise.
00:38:46.230 - 00:39:07.560, Speaker A: Thanks, guys. All right, so I guess take back is if you're a musician or creator out. Please, please consider releasing a music nft so we can change the system, change the game, change the world. Thank you guys so much for coming out tonight. Thank you. Chainlink Labs, Bret Cooper, Naomi, it's an honor to have you guys here. I'm so grateful that you came.
00:39:07.560 - 00:39:08.806, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody, for.
