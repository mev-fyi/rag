00:00:00.330 - 00:00:47.410, Speaker A: Regionally. You have us banks wanting to do transactions on blockchains with us banks. You have european banks wanting to do european banks because of their pilot regime for tokenization in the EU, and then you have banks in Asia in their local regions being willing to transact with other banks. So this is something I've never seen before. I've never seen banks on production say, let's do some transactions with other banks across our respective chains. So this is a completely new stage that is not the same movie as before. And this is what actually makes me very hopeful that we can create not only the public blockchain Internet of contracts, which will grow at its own pace, but we can actually create the bank chain Internet of contracts.
