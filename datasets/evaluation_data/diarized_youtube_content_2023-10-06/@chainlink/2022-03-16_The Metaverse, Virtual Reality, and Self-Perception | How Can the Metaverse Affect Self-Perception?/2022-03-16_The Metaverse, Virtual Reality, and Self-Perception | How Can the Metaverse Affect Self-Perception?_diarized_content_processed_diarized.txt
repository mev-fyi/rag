00:00:06.250 - 00:01:11.746, Speaker A: And I talked about when you are in virtual reality, you actually own like embody the virtual body. So it's totally different from other type of media. For example, in the digital games, you play a character, so you look at the character at your screen, so there's a distance from your actual self and the character. We know there's a first person perspective in video games, but you are still looking at his hands in the screen, but not, and you can see your actual hands in the real world. So there is still like a gap between your body and the character's body. But in virtual reality, if you have the experiences to put on the head mounted devices, which is HMD devices, you have these goggles and you put it on. If you have a virtual body, if you look at it, you look down, you'll feel like that virtual body is your own body, because you can move your hands and move your body and just move along like that.
00:01:11.746 - 00:02:08.130, Speaker A: So that thing is really interesting because of this embodiment. Protoes effect indicates that if the characteristics in this virtual body will influence your behavior and your attitudes. So from my perspective as a scholar, I wanted to go deeper with the theory, because that theory only talks about it would change your self perception and self alteration. And it didn't really specify why it changes your attitude and behavior. So in my two of the studies that I'm going to talk about today, my argument is that because the embodiment, it changes temporarily self concept, so you temporarily perceive yourself differently and it align with this virtual body. And because of that, that would change your threshold behavior.
