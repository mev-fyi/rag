00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.250 - 00:00:20.030, Speaker B: Thanks for coming everyone. Some of you, I think, I think I met you for the first time. Just to begin, I just want to ask if you could briefly introduce your project and yourself, starting from maybe the hub for sure.
00:00:20.180 - 00:00:36.870, Speaker A: Hello everyone. So we're the hub and we're building a platform to actually provide all the tools and services for the 3d Internet. We're backed by Decentraland Sandbox and Polygon. And very happy to tell you what we're doing with chain link right here in Seoul.
00:00:39.370 - 00:00:53.520, Speaker C: Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Alan and I'm the CEO of the Luxon and we are building web3 gaming platform on Polygon chain and also making first game which onboarding on Luxon called Desperado. Nice to meet you.
00:00:54.610 - 00:01:10.240, Speaker D: Hey guys, I'm Sunil. I'm the co founder of Localabs. We're building Markx right now and Markx is a platform where any brands communities can connect with creators so that they can license out their IP and create emojis out of it.
00:01:14.970 - 00:01:31.750, Speaker E: The Shanyinkesa Kachi tongue is a tutorial. Taiyangan Asha kona.
00:01:35.790 - 00:01:57.700, Speaker B: Okay, I'll translate for the Connect project. They're based on a web two project, a company that focuses on travel businesses as well as duty free shops. And they are trying to pursue an onboarding of the web two individuals and communities onto web3.
00:02:00.310 - 00:02:33.920, Speaker F: Hello everyone, my name is Jesse from Artverse. Artverse is web3 infrastructure for did we create did for making verified user to enter into web3 game specifically. So we are making did platform that you can create your own digital identity that can provide more benefit when you are joining to Webster protocol or games. And eventually we make a word for Marketplace where you can trade your Webster game items and another tokens, et cetera. Thank you.
00:02:34.530 - 00:03:10.746, Speaker B: Okay, so next question. I have a few for the projects. Can I start with local labs? Your platform is very interesting. I did a little bit of research, but it's not really easy to grasp, meaning it's not easy for people to understand just by looking at it. If you can briefly, very simply explain what you do and at the same time focusing on the Gen AI because AI is the trend right now. You're doing a lot of things with the generative AI space with your platform. Am I correct?
00:03:10.848 - 00:03:11.258, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:11.344 - 00:04:03.882, Speaker D: Okay, so to start with, in terms of the protocol that we're building, it might be hard to grasp because it's more on the licensing side of the brands. So basically brands can come to us, add their IP on chain and we basically allow them to license that out to creators to create products out of it. But it's kind of broad when you say that. And when we are super young, it's hard for any creator to come and build multiple products on top of it. So what we are focusing on right now is emojis. We see that a lot of users, especially in Korea, there's a huge market of emojis. Cacao talks using it, lines using it, and in terms of web, three communities too.
00:04:03.882 - 00:05:30.918, Speaker D: A lot of communities engage in Discord, telegram and a lot of messaging app and use emojis. So we see that as like an opportunity where we can have creators create emojis for multiple communities out there. So if you're a gaming community, if you're a brand, if you're even a protocol like Chainlink, you can use our platform to have creators create emojis and users and community members can use it. So that's basically what we are doing right now in terms of the jnai side of things. Since we are also creating a creator's network, we know that for a lot of artists, it's hard to compete against AI. So what we are doing is we're creating a generative model that basically allows any IPs to be used and create a first frame of the emoji so that the artists can now use that asset to create their divert version of the emojis that they want. So right now, one example is we just recently launched Petmon, which is basically you can upload a picture of your pet that converts that into a pet Pokemon looking like peT, and then our creators would create emojis out of that and then users would use it.
00:05:30.918 - 00:05:47.020, Speaker D: So that's one model that we're going after. But we are also looking to onboard a lot of AI model people who can basically help the artist with the model of their art.
00:05:48.350 - 00:06:31.690, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Yeah, I guess generative AI is a space that's continuing to grow and I believe that. I'm so curious. After a few months, I'll have the same conversation with you and you'll have an expanded idea and more different approach to what is there to come. So I guess I think the emoji side is a market that's been growing for decades and still I see that it's growing and what you're doing is very innovative in terms of what you're trying to grasp with the blockchain technology as well. So thanks. Next one I have for Jesse at Altverse.
00:06:31.690 - 00:07:25.420, Speaker B: Alt first is a digital ID project. Correct me if I'm wrong, so you will see that not only blockchain, but a lot of the industries are very much swarmed with bots. And there's a lot of artificial transactions, there's a lot of unknown identities, especially in the gaming sector as well. So we believe that digital ID is a space that will continue to expand. So that's something that, Jesse, you're doing in the space. So my question was, what is exactly that you want to do in the blockchain space? And the question is, what made you choose this area of focus when you decided to jump into the blockchain space? And how are you trying to solve the questions and problems that exist out there?
00:07:26.350 - 00:08:04.006, Speaker F: Okay, thank you for the. We actually, I was so impressed by the speech from the Sergei. He speeches about truth and transparency. That's why we really believe in Web three, I guess. But the reality is really opposite right now. So they are saying like, there are web3 gamers, 35, 35 million web3 gamers in the world from the report. But it says that based on the analysis of onchain, it's only 270,000.
00:08:04.006 - 00:08:50.422, Speaker F: It's less than 2%. So so many bots or fake account are like snatching our tokens or NFTs or gaming items, actually. That's very bad for the ecosystem, I guess. And our team truly believed that we want to build a transactional web3 ecosystem, which means we should know who are our counterpart parties. That's how we can transact. Even though there are like a blockchain technology there. We cannot compete with scams or fakers over the opposite word or someone who trying to try to do some bad things to us.
00:08:50.422 - 00:09:33.570, Speaker F: So, I mean, this did. Digital identity is really pivotal things we should build. And we found that this could be really beneficial for now. We found that the product market fit in the gaming industry right now because there are so many gamings, even though in this bear market, gaming protocols are very active in this market. And a lot of investment on gamings are increasing right now. So I guess we should have our own digital identity that you're trying to build instead of you create another metamask wallet to enter another protocol. That's what we are visioning to build.
00:09:33.570 - 00:09:34.338, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:09:34.424 - 00:10:03.630, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. That was a very clear and precise explanation. My next question goes to Chris from Connect. I believe Connect has released the Android version and also iOS. Is it released an iOS version of your app? And as far as I know, you have gained traction of getting over 30,000 users within a two week period. And about like 70,000.
00:10:03.630 - 00:10:42.760, Speaker B: So far, or maybe it has increased. That's a lot of traction. My question is, it seems like you are directly connecting web two benefits to the web3, community. And so that I want you to explain what type of membership benefits that you would have in your portfolio and how that would benefit the web3, community as well. And what the problems that you're trying to solve. Meaning that why blockchain? Why would you need blockchain to solve the problems that or to enhance the situation of what you're put in.
00:10:50.370 - 00:11:15.960, Speaker E: Tongiratanga, Taiyang and Jayang, bunja, kujungiyang and bubuna, ghana bakinja, manako, Seki, waga, Tamil, Chaguru, Taiyangan, kyo, Bina, Chongwe, Tara so.
00:11:20.010 - 00:11:51.150, Speaker B: We'Ve been in the traditional business for quite a bit of time and we realized that there are issues with transferring money. And because of this, we have also thought that the bottleneck has always been of the transaction of fiat and because of the fact that we're getting more globalized and there's a lot of transportation of items and also like human going from one place to another. But in terms of financial transaction, this was an issue that we thought we needed to solve.
00:12:04.890 - 00:12:10.230, Speaker E: Kukai J on the jungle.
00:12:24.750 - 00:12:47.680, Speaker B: So the blocker was always the remittance, settlement and transaction issues when doing business and also transacting. So this was an area that the blockchain could be a solution for. And at the same time, there's a lot of vast array of web two services that we can implement in terms of trying to solve the financial problems so that we could provide benefit in a more efficient way.
00:12:48.690 - 00:13:04.630, Speaker E: Tikina is a hangugun, Kumyung, Sandukoniko, KPI K culture, K Betty Kurdung, Tayangan, Asha Konabuna, Taiyangan.
00:13:12.190 - 00:13:42.674, Speaker B: And Korea is also the epicenter of a lot of the medical benefits. There's a lot of tourists that are coming into Korea for korean medical services. Also, K pop is very famous and it's worldwide, creating a wave. So a lot of the factors that we have here are the services that we can provide globally. So this is the focus of our attention at the moment. Okay, thank you. Next is the questions for.
00:13:42.674 - 00:14:32.260, Speaker B: I have the same question for Luxon and also the hub, and I think I'll go with Luxon first. Is that what part of the blockchain technology excites you the most? Meaning that there must be a reason why you decided to jump into applying the blockchain technology in the game that you have. And also because I believe that you also have a very vast experience in the web two gaming industry as well. So I wanted to ask that question and how would you like to drive your game or your project? By using blockchain. And if you can explain what relationship or what implementation that you had with Chainlink solutions and how you're using it.
00:14:32.710 - 00:15:15.374, Speaker C: For the first thing, before we start this business, our team made web two gaming, especially mobile game. And when we see the web two and web3 world, the major difference is the transparency. For example, in web two gaming, every user data is not owned by any personnel, but owned by a company. So there is no chance to get those kind of information in web two vault. But in web3 world, in the wallet, we can see the old user information transparency. Under those kind of situation, we try to build our platform called looks on. Our slogan is reread.
00:15:15.374 - 00:16:16.418, Speaker C: We keep. It means that if user connect their wallet on our website based on the user transaction history, we give some meaningful NFT to those user. So for example, if a user has some experience in the x infinity based on those NFT purchase history, we give our own NFT because we recognize those user as a potential our gaming user. So through this way, not just selling just NFT, but we want to get our potential user more gradually. For the second question, we are using Br solution really nicely. Because in web two world, especially in mobile game main business model is the random box called Gotcha. In Gotcha, it's always controversy to user because always good item have a rare chance to get every user always suspicious.
00:16:16.418 - 00:16:36.540, Speaker C: Our probability table. But on web two web3 world, by using Buoyalip solution, we didn't make our own probability table of our items, but Chainlink give our chance of those probabilities. So by using those solutions, we are completely free from those kind of issues.
00:16:37.630 - 00:16:38.620, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:16:39.790 - 00:17:22.454, Speaker A: I would like to answer that question by talking a little bit about the industry and how we have come so far. I mean, if you think about it, the adoption of blockchain technology has been mainly focused on financial applications. It's of course the low hanging fruit. And that's why we got of course bitcoin, Ethereum and all the DFI apps that came afterwards. But if you think about it, we've been in it like for what, since 2010 until today, 13 years of only financial applications. However, the technology has really evolved to a point where the standards can be applied in different ways. And we think that this is linked mainly to one very human thing which is called ownership.
00:17:22.454 - 00:17:49.374, Speaker A: Right. We talked about it with transparency, truth. At the beginning of the talks. And humans like to own things, and that's a very embedded things that we have since many, many years. And I think blockchain technology can really allow us to, so to say, show this ownership in the digital world. So we've all used the Internet for many years. However, we have never owned anything that we do on the Internet.
00:17:49.374 - 00:18:27.120, Speaker A: I mean, we have our social media profiles, we have our gaming assets, but it's not ours. And everything is siloed in their own ecosystem. And essentially what blockchain allows us is to actually move these assets in a transparent way between virtual worlds. So the way we're implementing this, and together with Chainlink, we've been working with them for about two years already started with creating oracles for land valuation. So we were a virtual real estate fund, bought lands and created algorithms to evaluate those lands. So we use Chainlink oracles to bring the algorithms on chain. That's how we started, also a financial application.
00:18:27.120 - 00:19:06.598, Speaker A: But now we realize that we have this new wave of adoption coming with gaming. And as the guys were mentioning it here before, identity ownership is going to be very important. So we're going to be using CCIP essentially to bring assets, crosschain, mainly nfts. So we have interoperable avatars that you can use in multiple virtual worlds. And through CCIP, we want to pretty much take these avatars and move them between worlds. We also created tools to build 3d instances. So these 3d instances that you build in a 3d sort of, say, modeling environment, you can then also take from different virtual worlds to others and also to different blockchains.
00:19:06.598 - 00:19:11.418, Speaker A: So that's how we're leveraging it and really excited about the future together with chain link.
00:19:11.584 - 00:19:30.560, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Last question, if you had like a 1 minute pitch about your project, if you don't, that's okay, but if there's anything that you want to mention before you go, it would be great. Nobody has desperado. Is it coming up?
00:19:31.810 - 00:19:34.094, Speaker D: Okay, I can go ahead.
00:19:34.132 - 00:19:34.720, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:35.050 - 00:19:55.000, Speaker E: The China Taiyang and Shimmer serviceman Choi Shima service.
00:20:02.610 - 00:20:28.790, Speaker B: We are working really hard to expand our presence in the APAC market especially, and we have actual tangible services that we provide to the users. So we are not only partnering off with Chainlink itself, but at the same time, if you have any suggestions or ideas, we would love to have an interaction with you and also see if we can create any synergy together going forward. Okay, thank you so much for coming.
00:20:28.940 - 00:20:29.880, Speaker D: Thank you.
