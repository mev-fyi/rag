00:00:00.650 - 00:00:48.646, Speaker A: Parametric. Parametric insurance is an insurance product where the claims handling and surprising is done automatically by some algorithms and by data. So data is, for example, weather data, or flight delay data, or any other data which is available which is connected to some real world risk. It could also be travel risk, or it could be supply chain risks, which are available as real time data. And as you all know, the Internet of things is making tremendous progress. And so the available data is abundant, and we have high quality data from all type of sources. And now we can use this data to trigger insurance events.
00:00:48.646 - 00:01:40.074, Speaker A: For example, application underwriting, where we need to examine the historical risk, but also the claim sandling when some lost events happens. And we need to calculate payouts and decide on payouts. And in our model, parametric insurance, these events are all triggered automatically by data. And to get reliable data, you need oracles. And that's the connection to chainlink and the Oracle world. And the oracle is the part, the interface between real world data and our smart contracts, which control the whole insurance workflow. And decentralized oracles are, of course, especially a good example or especially good fit for this because it cannot be manipulated.
