00:00:00.170 - 00:00:29.320, Speaker A: I noticed a trend coming up lately, and that is that people that never did anything in crypto are starting to get super interested in crypto, and particularly on Defi. And I'm talking about institutional investors. I get them friends of friends that usually do, you know, like traditional, hardcore finance, options trading, stuff like that. Never did crypto in their life. And they're calling because they know we're crypto entrepreneurs and asking if we can give them a one on one on Defi. And this has never happened to me before.
00:00:35.930 - 00:00:57.630, Speaker B: Hey, everybody. Welcome to Chainlink Live with Orbs. My name is Andy Boyan from Chainlink's labs, and I've got Daniel from chain. I'm not from Chainlink. I got Daniel from Orbs, and I've got tal from Orbs. Here to talk about orbs. What it is, the liquidity nexus protocol, single sided liquidity, staking for amms and all sorts of good juicy stuff.
00:00:57.630 - 00:01:06.290, Speaker B: I can see your questions, and we can bring them up a little bit later. But first, I want to hear about orbs. What is orbs? What makes it special? Can you give us the rundown?
00:01:06.950 - 00:01:26.230, Speaker A: So, first of all, orbs is an OG, meaning it's an old project. It was created in 2017, late 2017. It's been around for a very long time. And it's a blockchain infrastructure, a public. So there is no private network. Everything is public. Proof of stake based, one of the first proof of stake networks that were in production.
00:01:26.230 - 00:01:52.826, Speaker A: And the interesting, there are so many blockchains out there, and you need to position yourself. Where exactly do you see the opportunity? Because in the early days, everybody wanted to do l ones. Everybody wanted to replace Ethereum. And we know that this doesn't work. There is one ethereum. It's very difficult to do l ones that compete with it. And then people went into l two, and we see, like, polygon arbitrum.
00:01:52.826 - 00:02:38.042, Speaker A: We see so many new projects now actually going to production that are classic l two s. And Orx is a bit different. It's not quite an l two, but it's not quite an l one. So I would say it's like an l 0.51.5. Sorry. So you could say that Orbs is on the middle road between being polka dot, that has its, you know, it's a separate blockchain with its own incentive layer, and it has its power chains, which is very similar to a concept that we have called virtual chains that run independently. But it is closer to being an l two, meaning that it is very tightly coupled to Ethereum so we do many, many things directly on Ethereum.
00:02:38.042 - 00:02:57.446, Speaker A: For example, the entirety of orbs proof of stake is not running on the orbs blockchain. It's running on Ethereum's blockchain. We have like, weird things. For example, our native token doesn't run on our own network. Our native tokens run in the near c 20 on Ethereum. So we did some weird combination between an l one and an l two.
00:02:57.628 - 00:03:13.974, Speaker B: Interesting. So it's a version of a scaling solution or like a side chain kind of combination there. But then you've also got these virtual chains as well. And I've seen some talk on your website about enterprise and the virtual chains. Is that where the virtual chains tie in? Is that kind of your mission?
00:03:14.102 - 00:03:46.290, Speaker A: Yes. So the original idea was in 2017, 2018, nobody knew where blockchain is going to hit. So everybody wanted to find industries that are looking for blockchain solutions. And we kind of set our eyes on the enterprise world. Now, today we see that the enterprise world moves slowly and we see defi kind of like taking all the steam in the last one and a half years. And now we're kind of like looking at the direction where the enterprise does Defi. And this ties into what we're going to talk about later in Nexus.
00:03:46.790 - 00:03:57.590, Speaker B: Yeah, you and I both come from enterprise world. You more so than I. And things move slow. Right. Like there's a lot of people, they make a lot of decisions and they deal in a different time frame.
00:03:58.810 - 00:04:14.890, Speaker A: The big issue is, in the enterprise, you have the innovation teams and then you have the lawyers who sign the agreement. And the big problem is that you have one conversation with one team, and the conversation is very drastically different when you speak with the other because they move in completely different paces.
00:04:15.050 - 00:04:35.518, Speaker B: Yeah, well, we'll see how DeFi scales once we really start scaling and face those size challenges as well. Multiple departments. I don't doubt we'll see some of those similar conflicts. Okay, so that's orbs. Now, you've also got this liquidity nexus protocol. What is this? How does it fit in? This is your major DeFi offering on orbs.
00:04:35.694 - 00:05:12.362, Speaker A: This is the first one. We actually have a lot on that are not released yet because we've been very actively involved with DeFi in the last year. The best way to learn something is start experimenting with it yourself. So we just took a bunch of funds and started actually doing defi just to see how it works. It was mostly like personal funds of ours, or even funds that people led us to manage and help them manage for them. And we learned a lot throughout this process. And I saw two pains and they're completely separate.
00:05:12.362 - 00:05:46.822, Speaker A: And then orbit's nexus kind of like, was born from trying to combine them. So the first one is like a d five pain, and you probably experienced that. So you probably did farming. And as you know, when you did farming, you always, usually you need two tokens. And not only that, in all the uniswap v two and in sushi, you need them in equal amounts. One of the problems we had is it was never the same amount. You need ether and USD and USDC in the same amount, or you need ether and bitcoin in the same amount and your portfolio doesn't hold them in equal amounts.
00:05:46.822 - 00:06:17.140, Speaker A: And then you say, okay, maybe I'll buy some USDC just so I can farm. But that kind of defeats the purpose because I'm not long on USDC, I'm long on ether. And you don't want to alter your portfolio, your long positions, just so you can do a little bit of apy on the short term. So this was very annoying, trying to do this balancing act of finding pairs. And pairs are an inherent issue in liquidity. Because liquidity comes in pairs, it's always pairs. It doesn't work in single.
00:06:17.140 - 00:06:53.922, Speaker A: So this was one problem from the Defi world and a different problem. We kind of saw it in the know, the centralized, traditional world. And that problem is that the interest rates are know. Everybody knows know. You know that in your bank account. I recently moved to London and I bank with Barclays, and a few months ago I opened my Barclays account, and just for the fun of it, I went to see what they offer, and this was the most amusing thing. So I went and I went to see what do Barclays offer me as my savings account? Do you know what's the interest that they offer?
00:06:53.976 - 00:06:54.738, Speaker B: No idea.
00:06:54.904 - 00:06:56.740, Speaker A: 0.1%.
00:06:58.870 - 00:07:01.810, Speaker B: I think that's pretty good for banks right now, honestly.
00:07:03.510 - 00:07:16.114, Speaker A: 0.1 maybe. And then I said, you know what? Let's look at the other end. Let's say that I need a loan. Let's say I go into overdraft. How much could they charge me? Do you know what they charge?
00:07:16.242 - 00:07:17.142, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:07:17.276 - 00:07:25.290, Speaker A: I'm going to tell you and then we're going to google it because you're not going to believe me. 35% and I'm not kidding you. It's d five rate.
00:07:25.440 - 00:07:27.498, Speaker B: Go ahead, share your screen. Let's see.
00:07:27.584 - 00:07:31.440, Speaker A: Let's do it. Let's do it live. You see my screen?
00:07:31.810 - 00:07:33.520, Speaker B: Yeah, let me pull it up here.
00:07:40.850 - 00:07:41.886, Speaker A: Do you see it?
00:07:41.988 - 00:07:42.640, Speaker B: Yes.
00:07:43.510 - 00:07:55.990, Speaker A: Barclays overdraft fee. Who? Boom. See? First result. Ridiculous.
00:07:57.770 - 00:07:58.520, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:00.810 - 00:08:30.174, Speaker A: So this gives you an example how completely and utterly corrupt the centralized financial world is. But it does show you a lot of opportunity. I have a blog post about it. Give me 1 second. Sure. Look at this. So what I did is, so I started asking companies like corporates, what do you do with your cash flow? Like, you have access money that your company doesn't use.
00:08:30.174 - 00:08:54.850, Speaker A: And it's very what they usually do. For example, Apple. Apple has the biggest stash of cash in the world. So what do they do with this money? They invest it. And if you want to put it in something like bonds, you look at the returns that you get. And these are the returns. So I went online a few months ago to fidelity, and I wanted to see what are the returns that people get on dollars in bonds.
00:08:54.850 - 00:09:11.526, Speaker A: And you see the numbers. These are 0.1 or 0.2. Everything is so tiny. So it wasn't just me getting those lousy rates in the bank. It's actually big corporations that have a lot of money. They get those lousy rates as well.
00:09:11.526 - 00:09:51.466, Speaker A: And if they want to get more to fight inflation and stuff like that, they have to go into stocks and something that is much. Then, you know, an idea spark that said, okay, we have two different crowds here, and I think that we can marry them together. So on one side we can marry the defi side, and the defi side, for example, is somebody that has ether. Okay, so let's say that you have a bunch of ether. What are you going to do with it? So if you have ether and you're long on crypto, like we all are in Defi. So you go into, for example, a vault like Harvard's finance. I hope you're familiar with them.
00:09:51.466 - 00:10:15.838, Speaker A: It's a cool project, not related to us in any way, but it's a cool project that I use personally. And you want to farm with your ether. And then you look at the return for your ether, and by the way, you see that it's 15%. It's not actually 15%, it's 15 because of the farm rewards. The return is 0.4. So you get a very lousy return for ether. But if you look at the sushi.
00:10:15.838 - 00:10:59.950, Speaker A: Let's go sushi swap, USDC, you see that here you get significantly higher returns just because you have the two sides. And then I said, you know what? Like, people who have ether, they get lousy returns on ether. In Defi, people who have just dollars in the centralized world, they get lousy returns on their dollars. What happened? If we take these two parties, we marry them together and let them do eth, USDC farming. Each side brings their own token. I mean, the traditional finance guys will bring the dollars and the crazy DFI guys who like ether will bring the ether. And what we can do then is we can give them 20% and let them share the 20%.
00:10:59.950 - 00:11:14.830, Speaker A: So each party is going to do 20%, or you can split it differently. So instead of each party doing 0.1%, both parties, just by working together, they can do 20. And this seems like a pretty cool idea.
00:11:15.000 - 00:11:51.550, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a dating app for liquidity. Know, when I think talking, I've talked to a couple other founders and projects in Defi who realize there are enterprise companies who they need to stay in dollars. They can't take their treasury and just put it in eth or whatever it happens to be, but they want to do more with their funds. And even on a short term basis, they want to do something for a week, two weeks. Right? They have payroll to me. But you don't want to have a million dollars just sitting, doing nothing for two weeks. It's a million bucks.
00:11:51.550 - 00:12:00.658, Speaker B: So something like this, that's Defi, right? It's that accessibility, it's that permissionlessness. And then if you can do single sided, that's pretty intriguing, right?
00:12:00.744 - 00:12:24.154, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty intriguing. It's not easy to do because you need to plan the incentives very carefully. And this is where Chainlink comes in. We're going to talk about it later because if you do these sort of things, you're opening yourself up for exploits. We all heard about flash loans and how scary they are. So you need to protect yourself. It's not trivial to take two parties that have different goals and try to make them work together.
00:12:24.154 - 00:12:36.960, Speaker A: Although we use smart contracts, we do everything on Ethereum. Yeah. So basically trying to align this to happen also to solve the problem of impermanent loss. I don't know if you're familiar with that.
00:12:37.730 - 00:12:40.974, Speaker B: Will you define impermanent loss for our audience real quick?
00:12:41.092 - 00:13:10.242, Speaker A: Yeah. So every time you provide liquidity in an amn, for example, uniswap or sushiswap or pancake swap, if you like VSC. So every time you provide liquidity, you suffer a loss because people trade through the liquidity that you provided. So you are basically the counterpart. So let's say that everybody wants ether. You're basically giving them your ether and taking the dollars that they don't want. And this loss is impermanent loss.
00:13:10.242 - 00:13:23.760, Speaker A: So if you go in and you add liquidity, and by the time you remove liquidity, the price of ether is different from when it was when you started, then you're going to suffer a slight loss for it. And it doesn't matter if ether went up or down.
00:13:25.570 - 00:13:44.782, Speaker B: So a liquidity provider, the enemy is volatility. You don't want volatility. You want just people to trade when assets are stable. But people like to trade when assets are volatile too. Right? That's the exciting part. When things go up and down, that's when the trades happen. So you're kind of setting yourself up for default.
00:13:44.782 - 00:13:45.886, Speaker B: Impermanent loss.
00:13:45.998 - 00:13:46.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:47.930 - 00:13:58.790, Speaker C: Volatility is only a problem if you enter and exit at the worst case, it's the worst point in time, right. If you just wait, prices will eventually return. You can exit without impermanent loss.
00:13:59.290 - 00:14:21.646, Speaker A: Yeah. So think about it like a wave. Like waves in the ocean. So the price of Esor goes up and down and it doesn't remain exactly the same. So if you are in the long term as a liquidity provider and you got it in the same price, you can wait until the price returns. So these tiny shifts, they don't hurt you. The only problem is when ether goes into a bull run, and this is not the entirety of the year.
00:14:21.646 - 00:14:30.580, Speaker A: If you look statistically, the major changes in the price of ether or bitcoin happen in about ten days out of the entire year.
00:14:31.910 - 00:14:55.420, Speaker B: A bull run or a bear run. Right. If it's where there's $1,000 rise or dip in eth, just as an example, that really harms your position or changes it, we got some good questions here, and I think people will want to see. What does liquidity nexus look like? Do you guys have any shots yet or anything you can start talking about? I know you don't have things you can show us quite yet.
00:14:55.950 - 00:15:22.610, Speaker A: Well, the thing is that Orbs is an infrastructure company. I mean, what we do is we build protocols and we write solidity code on Ethereum. So what I can show you is the orbs mixers contracts. But I don't think it's going to be very interesting for anyone or explain how they were written. We are now working on integrating this protocol with various providers that are interested in being one of these two parts, one of these two sides.
00:15:23.510 - 00:15:29.640, Speaker B: So you're actively soliciting enterprises who want to be providers. Is that part of the model?
00:15:30.650 - 00:16:02.400, Speaker A: I would say so. Usually with enterprises, everything is much more complicated because there's a lot of licensing involved and there is a lot of regulatory issues involved. So normally we wouldn't be ourselves, the party who solicits, because usually need special regulations for that, special permits. But what we would do is we would work with partners who hold all of these licenses in all appropriate jurisdictions, and they would solicit enterprises and offer them the consulting services. We are a technology provider at the end of the day, but we make it possible for this to happen.
00:16:03.330 - 00:16:09.374, Speaker B: Keep has a question that I'm going to pop up here for you, and I'm going to broaden your question because I know you've asked a bunch.
00:16:09.422 - 00:16:09.730, Speaker A: Keep.
00:16:09.800 - 00:16:28.778, Speaker B: So keep says, do investors who are reluctant to risk cryptocurrency trust stablecoins, are these new investors you mentioned earlier, like there's more of these investors coming in, are they open to the idea of stablecoins? And Defi, are they still really just trying to learn and balance that risk out?
00:16:28.944 - 00:17:06.790, Speaker A: Okay, so very good question. So first of all, I think most of the stablecoins, particularly USDC, USDT, they're centralized, so they don't have the inherent decentralized protocol risks of stablecoins like Dai. So let's put the dais of the world aside. Fi, for example, we saw issues with that, with holding the peg, so it's not trivial. But with USDC, USDC will hold the peg because it's a completely centralized company and it's audited. So they do trust it. I mean, if people don't trust it, it's just because they're afraid of crypto in general.
00:17:06.790 - 00:17:27.660, Speaker A: And this is nonsense. We do see the more educated financial players and they understand what USDC is. They know it's completely regulated. There are accountants that go audit, make sure that there are enough fiat dollars in the bank. So it's completely 100% safe? I wouldn't say 100%, but as safe as any money in a fiat bank account is.
00:17:29.230 - 00:17:33.798, Speaker B: Cool. Go ahead. What was that, Janiel?
00:17:33.894 - 00:17:37.226, Speaker C: I said any other custodian, basically, yeah, it's a custodian.
00:17:37.338 - 00:17:39.630, Speaker A: And centralized world loves custodians.
00:17:40.370 - 00:18:05.240, Speaker B: Yeah, they make a lot of sense, right. As you speak the same language from one world as you're trying to bring it into the new world a bit. Keep has another question here about the structure of liquidity nexus. And is the orbs token, is it the orbs token? I assume there's an integration there where you can stake orbs as well, and trade. Is that a part of the liquidity Nexus protocol? How does that fit in?
00:18:05.690 - 00:18:42.254, Speaker A: So first of all, we are very firm believers in open networks and open protocols. And you don't want to shove your incentive system, because if you do that, then you won't be successful. What you want to do is you want to prove that there is demand for this protocol and then you want to be the best implementation for it. So it's not entirely Orbs. The protocol is open. Anyone can provide their own incentives in the protocol. But we do believe that the Orbs platform provides certain benefits, like ideal benefits, to marry enterprise players and to marry Defi players.
00:18:42.254 - 00:18:49.830, Speaker A: You don't have a lot of players in the market who can play both sides, and we have a lot of experience with both sides, so I think we can be competitive.
00:18:50.250 - 00:19:00.040, Speaker B: Excellent. And you guys have recently become Chainlink price feed sponsors as well. And do we have an orbs price feed yet, or is that in the works?
00:19:01.290 - 00:19:24.538, Speaker A: It is in the works. There are a lot of difficulties with the Orbs price feed because a significant part of Orbs is traded in Korea. And as you know, all the kimchi issue. So there are difference in prices. So it's not easy to get quality price feeds across the east and the west.
00:19:24.634 - 00:19:30.642, Speaker B: All right. Teams are working on it. Yeah. Okay, cool. I'm going to go back to my questions. Thank you for your questions. Keep.
00:19:30.642 - 00:20:12.094, Speaker B: Again, everyone, we are here with Orbs protocol talking to Tal and Daniel. My name is Andy Boyne from Chainlink Labs, and we're having a good session of Chainlink live talking about impermanent loss, single sided liquidity staking. And I know many of the link enthusiasts and Chainlink enthusiasts out there are big fans of single sided staking for amms as well. So this is great to talk to you guys. Oh, here was my question. When you're dealing with single sided staking, because like sushi or uni, when you stake, you have to have a balanced pool. Is there a danger for single sided amms in having an imbalance? And how do you do that? You mentioned before a little bit.
00:20:12.094 - 00:20:16.740, Speaker B: Like, there's some math that has to be done. How do you do, like, what's the challenge there?
00:20:17.270 - 00:20:50.666, Speaker A: Okay, so basically, you can't imbalance the pool. It's not possible if the pool is imbalanced. Just there is money that's not working. So imagine that it works this way. Let's say that you have a lot of corporate dollars, fiat that comes in, let's say, a million dollars. So it would just sit in the contract, in the orbs, in the liquidity nexus contract, and do nothing. So you would have a million dollars of USDC just sitting there waiting, not generating any ApY, not farming, nothing.
00:20:50.666 - 00:21:14.366, Speaker A: Then there would be, let's say, a defi layer, somebody who has ether, and they want to farm, so they need some USDC to farm. So they would send their ether to the contract. Let's say they have $1,000 worth of ether. That's it. So they would send that ether to the contract. The contract would take $1,000 worth of dollars, marry them together, create an NFT out of it. You have to do nfts here because it's non fungible.
00:21:14.366 - 00:21:46.590, Speaker A: It's a different conversation of why that is. And then the contract sends it to do farming on sushi, for example, in mustard chef, or whatever it is. So basically, if there are not enough ether participants, the dollars will just stay there and not work. But what we expect to happen is to have oversubscription of ether. And the reason for that is because you saw the returns on ether, returns on ether stock. Now, if you could do 30% on ether, you would be oversubscribed.
00:21:48.610 - 00:21:57.618, Speaker B: Well, I mean, a lot of the staked ether contracts, that's why they're so high, is you're getting a good return on staked ether right now, even though you're locking it up for an unknown period of time.
00:21:57.784 - 00:22:20.826, Speaker A: Yes, but then, even then, it's low. It's like 6%, and you're locked for two years. So if you could do 30. But I have to say, it's not without the risks. There are always risks. There are no free meals in Defi, although many people like to sell free meals in Defi. So the risk here, just to be completely transparent, is the impermanent loss we talked about.
00:22:20.826 - 00:22:57.894, Speaker A: And the reason for that is that the corporate players, they can't suffer any impermanent loss, because impermanent loss ties into crypto volatility. And if you have an institutional company or a corporation, they don't care about ether, they don't care about bitcoin, they don't care if the prices change. They don't care about volatility. They want to put dollars, they want to get their dollars back. So we have to protect them 100%. And in order to do that, if there is any impermanent loss, all the impermanent loss goes on the ether side. So the ether provider takes all of the impermanent loss, but we do compensate them for it.
00:22:57.894 - 00:23:18.700, Speaker A: And the way we do that is that we don't split the rewards 50 50, we do it 80 20. So basically, you get 80% of the rewards for taking the impermanent loss, and this reduces the APY for the institutional players. But that's okay because we're competing with 0.1 there. It's not very difficult.
00:23:20.350 - 00:23:45.698, Speaker C: Also that from the eyes of the regular Vidian, from crypto that looks to make high yields on ether, they usually don't really care if they end up with a little less ether. If the prices of ether actually went up a lot and caused a lot of impermanent loss. So it's kind of a win win scenario, even though you're getting more risk, right?
00:23:45.784 - 00:23:57.640, Speaker B: It's really different if I'm in ether, and another token, that impermanent loss, I'm eating it somewhere. But if I'm just in Eth, then the number goes up. Well, then I won somewhere. So that's good.
00:23:59.630 - 00:24:20.110, Speaker C: A good ballpark for how much better the APY is, is if you look at your normal sushi, for example, ETHC pairs, basically, you take the double that. You take 80% of that, of the double. It's basically how much you will get more or less on the equity.
00:24:20.450 - 00:24:32.046, Speaker A: You double the APY because you only provide half the money. Okay. Because the USDC party provides the other half. So that's why you double the APY, and then you take 80% of that because that's your cut of the rewards.
00:24:32.238 - 00:24:45.698, Speaker B: Cool. I got a couple of good questions, and then we'll kind of wrap up. We are heading towards time, but we get talking DFI, and things happen as they always do. Is there impermanent loss protection? Like, does such a thing exist?
00:24:45.874 - 00:25:17.460, Speaker A: Okay, very good question. So there are many people who claim to have developed the miracle pill that is impermanent loss protection. But I believe strongly that this pill does not exist. The only thing in my eyes, you can do is create bots, like, let's say a stop loss bot that will pull you out if the impermanent loss reaches that amount. But to create an incentive system that fights impermanent loss is impossible. And I'll try to explain why. Impermanent loss is what makes amms work.
00:25:17.460 - 00:25:56.942, Speaker A: Amms, as you know, every decentralized economy, has to have wholesome incentives for the economy to work. Because if people, for example, would not make money from providing liquidity, then there wouldn't be any liquidity for the traders. If traders would not pay reasonable fees, they wouldn't do any trades, and then liquidity providers won't make money. So you need to have a healthy economy, and impermanent loss is part of that. It's a crucial part of the healthy economy. Impermanent loss is what causes the price of the Amn to follow the market price. Because through the impermanent loss, who earns the impermanent loss? I mean, if somebody loses it, that means that somebody earns it.
00:25:56.942 - 00:26:36.380, Speaker A: It's a zero sum game at the end of the day. So who earns impermanent loss? So the arbitrators earn it. So you have all the time in all amms, basically, because the uniswap v two model is a closed model, it doesn't have any price feed. As a manufacturer of price feed, you are very familiar with it. So the only way it follows the market price is that arbitragers see the difference in prices and they start trading in order for the prices to meet, because they can make money out of the difference. And this money is the impermanent loss. And if you would stop giving them these incentives, then they won't trade, and then you would have a bunch of amms with pegs that are not related to anything.
00:26:37.150 - 00:26:59.986, Speaker B: You would have no markets. Right? That's a great explanation, and what a great question. That's a really hard problem to solve. It doesn't just go away if you give people incentives, it's still in the system somewhere. So who are you offloading it to? Is a better question than am I protected from impermanent loss? Is a good question, but not is it gone? Because it's not gone.
00:27:00.168 - 00:27:30.140, Speaker A: Some projects who claim to have impermanent loss protection, they actually mask it cleverly by using their own token to subsidize it. So basically they're giving away extra reward to fight the impermanent loss. So you feel like there is no impermanent loss, but it's not actually gone. They're just giving you a different reward token and hoping that their own token economy does not collapse from giving away too many rewards. So that's how some projects do that.
00:27:30.830 - 00:27:49.010, Speaker B: If you have anti gravity boots, you don't get rid of gravity. It's still there, you're doing something. Anyway. Sorry, that was a bad metaphor. One more good question. We have great philosophy questions here, and keep has another one just about that general direction of the industry. Do you think Defi can replace, and he uses the word replace traditional CFI exchanges?
00:27:49.430 - 00:28:23.974, Speaker A: Very good question. I like the philosophy aspects of things. I don't think that Defi can replace traditional exchanges, and the reason for that is that Defi will always be more expensive and slower. So I love Defi, and I do defi, and I hate exchange. So I'm a very firm believer in DeFi. But we do need to be honest and say that decentralized systems are always less efficient than centralized ones. So if you look at the fees, for example, you would pay a lower fee on the finance centralized exchange that you would pay in uniswap.
00:28:23.974 - 00:28:50.646, Speaker A: That's just the way it is. It's 0.3% versus below 0.2. You would wait at least 10 seconds before you have a confirmation on a decentralized exchange, something that is sub second or sub millisecond on finance. So there would always be markets for centralized exchanges. The reason is, what you should ask is, what does Defi provide? And the answer here is a level playing field. We talked about that.
00:28:50.646 - 00:29:24.690, Speaker A: The traditional financial system is corrupt. Companies like Barclays banks have the audacity to ask somebody for 35% interest over money that they owe and give them 0.1. These are gray markets. I don't know how anyone thinks this is remotely reasonable, but this is how the world works. In the financial system, people make money off of being close to the plate. The playing field is not level. And this is what DeFi changes.
00:29:24.690 - 00:30:08.442, Speaker A: Everything is transparent. Everybody's equal. And the equal opportunity is very crucial for some parties for doing successful business. I'll give you one example. Can you trust the volume that a centralized exchange reports? Okay, let's say that you want to own a low cap token, whatever token that you want to buy. So one of the questions you're going to ask yourself is, is this token liquid? If I want to sell it later on, would I be able to? So what do you do? You go to the exchanges and you try to assess the liquidity. Are the liquidity numbers real? Did you ever try to check if they're real? Well, exchanges are incentivized to lie because people would go to the most liquid exchange.
00:30:08.442 - 00:30:43.478, Speaker A: So why wouldn't the exchange report fake high liquidity numbers just to attract more customers? So there's a problem here. Inherently, centralized exchanges lie, and they're incentivized to lie. Now, if you want to know true liquidity, the only way in the universe that you could do that is with something like Defi. And a financial system that has proofs for every aspect and the parties cannot lie is a game changer. So it does have a lot of benefits to the humankind in general, but there would still be markets for people mostly interested in paying the smallest fee or doing the quickest transaction.
00:30:43.654 - 00:31:21.174, Speaker B: That's the trade off, right? It's speed and cost versus security and autonomy and transparency. And those are things. And access too, if you take a look at compliance and where can a centralized exchange operate, where can you offer insurance products? Some states, nation states, it's not possible to do unless you're going through Defi permissionless system. So keep. I love your question as well. Replace, I don't know about replace, but certainly improve on some aspects of, and give people some other options. With that, we're going to wrap up because we're over time a bit, and I don't want to keep you guys too long.
00:31:21.174 - 00:31:34.380, Speaker B: But first, what is on the roadmap for orbs, what's coming up next and when can we see that you don't have to stick to hard dates here. We're not a stickler because we understand development schedules, but what's coming up.
00:31:35.310 - 00:32:14.402, Speaker A: So we are obsessed with improving Defi and finding areas in Defi that we feel that the infrastructure that we've built over the years can do tremendous impact on. And one of the areas, for example, is improving on strategies. So if, you know, if you look at strategies, you've seen volts, for example, volt's products are a very cool product because they've taken, they mask away the complexity. You just give them your money and they do a bunch of smart contracts that manage it for you. So you don't have to follow everything and you don't have to go compound yourself or do other complicated things. But the funny thing is that vaults suck. What do I mean by that? They suck.
00:32:14.402 - 00:32:41.102, Speaker A: They're very, very simple. If you think about what a bot could really do, a bot should juggle ten positions, see the most profitable ones, and move the money here. Take loans, liquidate the loans. This is something about ten levels above what vaults today can do. And the reason for that is that the vaults are very limited by the EVM and by the price. You have to do these things off chain. And doing these things off chain in a secure way is not easy.
00:32:41.102 - 00:32:54.370, Speaker A: It's very close to Chainlink's oracle problem. So you need other parties that have incentives that can do these things in a dedicated way. And we believe we have an advantage there as well. So these are some of the things we're thinking about and planning.
00:32:55.190 - 00:33:14.714, Speaker B: Excellent. It's good to hear that. And of course, Chainlink, we've got solutions around those as well. So let's talk off chain computation and all sorts of things Chainlink provides. Tal Daniel, it has been awesome talking to you, getting to know you guys and your perspective. Hilarious.
