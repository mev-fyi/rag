00:00:14.790 - 00:00:15.530, Speaker A: Sweet.
00:00:17.310 - 00:00:18.700, Speaker B: Share this with you.
00:00:19.070 - 00:00:19.434, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:19.472 - 00:00:30.366, Speaker B: Well, thanks, everyone who's joining us on YouTube. We'll get started here in a few minutes, then here's a link for you and then I'll drop this into some of our channels.
00:00:30.478 - 00:00:31.140, Speaker A: Sure.
00:00:36.470 - 00:00:37.220, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:00:45.060 - 00:00:46.112, Speaker A: It cool.
00:00:46.166 - 00:01:18.312, Speaker B: Welcome, everyone. Yeah, really excited to have everyone joining us today. We'll get started here in a few minutes. Let some more people join. I if you have questions throughout, definitely drop them into the chat. I'll also share all the links that we have going forward. Really excited to have Kay joining us, founder of Spectre Group, Spectre AI.
00:01:18.376 - 00:01:21.656, Speaker C: Right, Spectre AI. Thank you for having me, Tina.
00:01:21.768 - 00:01:23.950, Speaker B: Yeah, really, really excited for it.
00:01:25.600 - 00:01:26.012, Speaker A: Cool.
00:01:26.066 - 00:01:28.000, Speaker B: Well, are you ready to go?
00:01:28.150 - 00:01:34.640, Speaker C: Let's go. Let's kick it off. Let me know if I break off halfway, if there's any problem with the Internet or something, but it should be fine.
00:01:34.790 - 00:01:37.472, Speaker B: Perfect. Yeah, no, you sound great. So cool.
00:01:37.606 - 00:01:37.868, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:37.894 - 00:02:10.296, Speaker B: I really want to thank the Spectre community, the chainlink community, for joining us today. In addition, really want to thank you, Kay, for joining. Really excited for this. The goal of Q A is to allow the community to learn more about all the cool stuff that Specter is working on, our relationship and how we're working together and how they're using decentralized oracles and to learn what makes this integration unique. A little bit about the agenda today. So, for about the first 20 to 30 minutes, I'll be asking questions to Kay. If you have questions again, make sure to drop them in the chat.
00:02:10.296 - 00:02:16.930, Speaker B: If there's time, we'll get to them. If not, I'll make sure to drop all the links so you can ask those in our specific channels ourselves as well.
00:02:17.860 - 00:02:18.176, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:18.198 - 00:02:21.600, Speaker B: But without further ado, thanks again, Kay. Really excited.
00:02:22.260 - 00:02:58.424, Speaker C: Thank you, Keena. So I'll introduce myself. For those of you that don't know me, my name is Kay Kimani and I, along with my team, developed Spectre over the last three years. Now, Spectre AI was a token sale, December 2017. That's when we completed it. And we have been working on financial technologies almost since 2014, 2015. And what we provide to traders, specifically short term traders, we're talking about day traders that aren't specifically investors in assets.
00:02:58.424 - 00:03:53.464, Speaker C: Long term is the ability to generate a high level of return well above peers in a very short duration and also, obviously, take on that level of risk as well. It's not leverage trading, which is quite unique. And I'll get into that a little bit in detail, if you allow me. But I think before I do that, I'll give you a bit of a background in terms of my background, where I've come from. So prior to entrepreneurship, which I've been doing with my current team for the last nine years, it's been nine years, almost ten. I was working as an equity research analyst at JPMorgan and then Goldman Sachs, and at Goldman Sachs specifically, we were also into long short equity investing. And so our background has always been in finance, but finance has changed so much in the last ten years, and especially now in the last few years, given what's happening in the macro picture.
00:03:53.464 - 00:04:51.244, Speaker C: So we created a pretty unique platform around three years ago, and we've been pretty much plugging away at growth, hacking growth in the last three years. Today, this platform, Spectre AI for traders that sign up to it, and by the way, us citizens are not accepted because we are all about the KYC, all about the regulations. What it allows traders to do is to generate anywhere between 70% to 400% roi within the time frame that they specify. So they basically structure a trade, and I'll tell you where Chainlink comes into this, but they structure a trade long or short, on any underlying asset, and they will say when it should expire and also what level of risk they want to take. So if when it expires, they have not won the trade, then they can choose how much they wish to lose. So whether it's 99% or whether it's just 5% or 10%, we allow them to structure these contracts. And that's what makes us unique.
00:04:51.244 - 00:05:56.732, Speaker C: And of course, that opens up a wide gamut of outcomes for traders who are looking to make high risk adjusted returns. So a trader can look at Tesla, for example, and say, okay, I believe Tesla in the next ten minutes is going to rise, and I would like to take a trade of $100. Now, if they're correct, depending on the time of the market, depending on which trader our liquidity pool is matching against, they can earn anywhere from as little as 70% all the way up to 400% on that. And so why this is unique is you effectively have much lower holding period risk for any trader. They understand what that is because, for example, now if I'm buying a token on Uniswap, which by the way is a fantastic tool, generally speaking, I'm buying it to make a good ten x or five x or those type of returns, but I have to hold out for that. I have to hold out a few months, if not a year or two. Typically, things tend to pump a lot quicker, but generally speaking, you're not going to be making 90% return within 2 seconds.
00:05:56.732 - 00:06:17.064, Speaker C: Our most popular option on the platform is actually five second trades followed by 15 minutes and then five minute trades. So you can make close to double your money if you predict the market correctly on our platform. And of course, what differentiates us is the fact that we're all about risk mitigation.
00:06:17.112 - 00:06:17.324, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:17.362 - 00:06:31.084, Speaker C: So there's no leverage on the platform, there's no margin calls on the platform. And, of course, where Chainlink comes in, and I don't know if you want to go into that now or should we kind of go at a piecemeal?
00:06:31.132 - 00:06:31.296, Speaker A: No.
00:06:31.318 - 00:06:36.640, Speaker B: Yeah, no, this is a perfect time. No. So it sounds like you got a lot of high frequency.
00:06:37.300 - 00:07:10.232, Speaker C: It's all about the high frequency. And our returns are unparalleled in the sector. I mean, there's certainly no crypto provider that allows for this. We're not for investors, we're for the traders, and we provide returns that other brokers in the space simply cannot do. So, in terms of chainlink, here's what we did. So, traditionally, people were depositing on our platform, whether they're using the centralized wallet or the decentralized option, which is pretty interesting for crypto traders. They were depositing either in Ethereum or bitcoin or largely fiat.
00:07:10.232 - 00:07:53.244, Speaker C: Right, fiat currencies, and they were getting paid out in fiat. So we had traders that were making maybe 2300% a day after three or four trades, and then they basically withdrew their earnings in fiat back to their bank account, what have you. But then when we see, we've seen the growth in DFI, and we're a company that likes to innovate, we're not an also ran. So we're not trying to create another uniswap or anything like that. But if you actually go back to our white paper three years ago, you will see that we were the first decentralized autonomous liquidity pool. The concept of the DAlP, if you actually Google Dalp, you'll see it was very similar to what Uniswap is now doing, and they've had wild success with. So what we said, we basically said, okay, Defi is definitely growing, but we want to be on the right side of the law.
00:07:53.244 - 00:09:01.852, Speaker C: We want to do it with KYC, which is important to us, but equally want to capitalize on that opportunity. So we reached out to Chainlink, and Chainlink, as we've seen in the last three days, especially, it's so important to have multiple price feeds verifying a decentralized price, rather than just one random oracle, because that opens it up to fraud. So what we needed chainlink to do is to verify the actual defi deposit amount value. When a trader deposits money at Spectre to trade, so far, we would only show it in fiat or eth equivalent. Right, but how do we actually show it in different tokens, ERc 20 tokens, like what is the value of their balance in synthetics? If they've deposited, let's say $1,000 worth of synthetic coins as collateral on our system, where do we actually adjust their balance because of the fluctuation in synthetic prices? We need an oracle to do that. And that's where Chainlink came in. And we've been using Chainlink now actually almost under the hood for our Defi boost wallet for two months already and without any incident.
00:09:01.852 - 00:09:37.864, Speaker C: So I'm happy to report that. And the key thing now that we allow traders to do, for example, the Chainlink community, if they are obviously investors in Chainlink, but they have a part of Chainlink where they say, okay, I would like to play around with it, I want to grow my chainlink balance. Now they can actually get paid in Chainlink. So if they earn, if they actually have three, four winning trades, and let's say they deposit 1000 chain links and they've made a 300% return, then they can actually get that much out in chain link coins, not necessarily fiat.
00:09:37.912 - 00:09:38.172, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:38.226 - 00:10:26.920, Speaker C: And the beauty is also that it can be in different coins. So I can deposit in chain link, but I can earn in synthetics, if that makes sense. So that's what we're kind of enabling with the defi wallet. And that's our kind of contribution to the sector, if you will, in terms of where things are headed. And I think this is probably the most quote unquote exciting bit. And we're probably three months away from that is right now, if a chain link community member comes to a platform and they deposit link or whatever, and they trade the underlying asset on which they're taking a speculative trade on a speculative directional bet, if you want to call it, is actually things like Tesla, things like currency pairs, traditional currency pairs, euro, US dollar, gold, and a few equities.
00:10:27.000 - 00:10:27.580, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:27.730 - 00:11:07.144, Speaker C: But fast forward two to three months from now, we are actually going to be plugging in something like Uniswap, which allows traders to trade the entire gamut of defi coins as well. So what that means is right now, let's say I have a token that I'm pretty bullish on. And if I invest in it now on uniswap, it may do three x, it may do five x in the next few months. Fantastic, right? There's definitely that opportunity. Equally, it could also go to zero. We know how dangerous DFI can be. However, what the spectre D five boost wallet is adding now is actually the ability for me to bet on that coin now within the next 2 seconds, or 1 second or five minutes or 15 minutes.
00:11:07.144 - 00:11:55.380, Speaker C: And I can get 90% return out crystallized, right? So I'm not stuck to holding that token. We are actually creating synthetic markets for you. So you can actually get out higher returns much quicker. And obviously that also means a different risk profile as well. The thing is, and I'll shut up in a bit, but the one point I do want to make is staking has its ups and it has its downs, right? So if the underlying project obviously has a really good economics profile, underlying volumes, billable volumes, are growing. Kyber, I think is one example that people take example of then the APY that the annual percentage yield that these projects pay actually makes sense. But you see in this space, there's a lot of garbage tokens that are paying 100% APY, 50% APY.
00:11:55.380 - 00:12:24.880, Speaker C: And that's like a pyramid scheme. Because there isn't an underlying engine of growth, right. Driving that level of growth. With Spectre, obviously we've have over 20 million in billable volumes. We are almost a break even project. More importantly, we've done over 2 million real money transactions. And the point that I want to make is, if you are stuck with a lot of money in a token, over a three year vesting schedule, in a token that has good APY, you may not be able to sell, right.
00:12:24.880 - 00:12:41.976, Speaker C: It's the greater fool's theory. They may actually sell ahead of you. And we saw that in the recent DeFi correction. A lot of people were stuck. So what we're basically telling traders is, okay, staking is good, if you believe in that. We're not saying it sucks. What we're saying is that you can actually generate very high levels of return in a few minutes on our platform.
00:12:41.976 - 00:13:19.504, Speaker C: Forget having being stuck into staking contracts for a long period. So it depends on the trader's profile, their risk profile, their investment horizon. There are obviously investors who will say, well, why would I want to make 90% on Spectre today when I can make ten x over, let's say two years by investing in a good quality team in a d five project. And then we would say, we agree with you, there's no reason for you to use Spectre. But I get the feeling that a lot of people that are entering these defi projects right now for staking, they're doing it for the quick gains. They don't really care about the tech, and that's fine. We're all humans.
00:13:19.504 - 00:13:41.720, Speaker C: We want to bring forward our holding period. Time value matters, and therefore we created Spectre a few years ago. So I would say it's worth trying out. We have a demo account. You can see the chain link icon there as well. So it's a verified price feed. And give it a shot, see if you like it.
00:13:41.720 - 00:13:44.270, Speaker C: And I think it could be of interest.
00:13:45.120 - 00:14:22.424, Speaker B: Well, yeah, thanks a lot for sharing, and I'll make sure to drop all these links into the description afterwards for everyone that's listening in. No, but you guys have a very unique approach to defi that you don't hear about. A lot of people are all about these high APIs and these unsustainable platforms, but this kind of takes it all to a different angle. So really interesting. And congrats to your team. One thing, so you talked about this defi boost wallet. Do you want to kind of break that down of how this works one more time for people that maybe might have missed that in there?
00:14:22.622 - 00:15:38.012, Speaker C: Absolutely. So think about it this way. Right now, if you are depositing money at binance or Kraken or whatever, you're ultimately sending them funds, right? And you are depositing, let's say, in dollars, you're buying bitcoin with it, et cetera, with the view for a long term gain, hopefully, or for changing between cryptos on our platform, what we're basically saying is if you are interested in generating a high level of risk adjusted return during the day, within five minutes or two minutes or a few hours, whatever, then our platform is for you. And you don't need to deposit in dollars or just bitcoin, Ethereum, you can actually use your favorite defi tokens, right? So whether it's Ave, which I think is now lend, whether it's chainlink or whether it's synthetix, if you believe that you have a pot of money right now in these tokens, that is not doing much, right, and it's a few hundred dollars or whatever, and you want to double it or you want to triple it over the next few days and you believe you're good at trading, that's the key point, right? We're not just paying you for depositing. We're not a staking company. You deposit in the DFI boost wallet, you trade the underlying markets. And if you use your technical analysis or FA fundamental analysis correctly, you will be matched with another trader who will pay you out all algorithmically.
00:15:38.076 - 00:15:38.400, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:38.470 - 00:16:00.552, Speaker C: Or you'll be matched against our liquidity pool and you will earn 90% or 100% or whatever it is in the coins that you deposited. So as a chain link trader, I can say, okay, I'd like to deposit $1,000 worth of chain link. And I believe that by the end of the day, the euro us dollar will be down by even a pip, even a percent, even one basis point.
00:16:00.606 - 00:16:01.064, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:01.182 - 00:16:29.164, Speaker C: If you are right, you would be paid out 80% instantly, but in chain link. So you've just increased your chain link balance by 80%. Right. And you can structure these contracts in a way, of course, that if you lose, you only lose, let's say, 25% of your trade, not 90%, 80%. But that also has a corresponding impact on the potential payout. This is up to the trader how they structure this so called digital contract. That's the DFI boost wallet in a nutshell.
00:16:29.164 - 00:17:05.432, Speaker C: Of course, it's not only chain link, you can deposit other D five coins as well. And we call it boost because of the risk returns profile relative to, let's say, leaving your wallet with just staking right where you're earning, let's say 1020 percent a year, which is fine because obviously maybe you have larger deposits there. But as we've seen recently in DFI, sometimes you could get a 30, 40, 50% correction in that token and you're stuck. You can't actually sell it because you're stuck into a staking rewards program. So obviously we don't hold your tokens in that way. You can withdraw them anytime. So that's basically the DFI wallet.
00:17:05.432 - 00:17:27.236, Speaker C: And in around three months time, we will be adding a range of, hopefully up to 50 really popular DFI coins. The top ones on uniswap, you can actually take long, short trades on them and structure them for expiry within seconds. And I think that really will up the ante in terms of what we're offering. Does that give a kind of a.
00:17:27.338 - 00:17:51.130, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's perfect. And so we were talking before too, because trust is a big thing, or how is my funds secure? And we were talking before about your team. So you guys have been working with each other for over nine years and it kind of, kind of came into this project. And have there been audits and other things that have been completed on the platform itself?
00:17:51.900 - 00:18:19.824, Speaker C: Yeah. So glad you brought the question up. So we're kind of dinosaurs in this space, but we haven't been too much in the limelight. I was telling you that this is my first kind of public appearance in three years. We're all about the product. We're a very product focused team that'll become very clear to you if you actually open an account. We have done, I think, three or four different layers of audit on our actual smart contracts for the decentralized wallet.
00:18:19.824 - 00:18:48.030, Speaker C: So on our platform, you can trade centralized, which has its advantages in terms of trade entry speed in terms of payouts. If you are, let's say a crypto anarchist, which we do have those as well, then you don't have to deposit with us. You can trade purely decentralized, but you need to KYC in order to get clearance to access the actual platform. The decentralized smart contract has been audited three layers. More importantly, we had a hacker one. I don't know if you know hacker one. They're based in the US.
00:18:48.030 - 00:19:58.724, Speaker C: We had a deep hacker bounty with them, which lasted three months after our token sale. And the thing to note also is that we have built a wide nexus of partnerships with payment service providers that are all regulated around the world, which allow traders to deposit in a range of fiat and non fiat options after KYC to build those it takes know we live in a very AML compliant, and I think maybe some of your people want to shoot me after this, but I'm going to speak my mind. We live in a very AML and KYC compliant world. It's only getting tougher and regulators are not going to bend to a KyC less world. It's actually going to move the other way. So we have had a lot of audits and really importantly is if you actually google us, that's a big litmus test, right? So if you go to forex or trading platform brokerage review services, you will generally find a lot of negative reviews about brokerages. Generally speaking, brokerages have a bad name, right? Not all, but generally speaking, it's difficult for brokerage to have good name for us.
00:19:58.724 - 00:20:34.530, Speaker C: If you go to forex peace army, which is considered one of the top places where you can see various brokers ranked, we have a good reputation and we certainly don't have a bad reputation across the board. We've had zero incidents of fraud. Traders have always wanted, by the way, we've had, I think in total we have paid out just in the last quarter or in the last year. I think it was over 5 million in wins. The figure is possibly higher. I'd need to go back to our files. But traders who earn, they get paid by the liquidity pool or by other traders because we match them.
00:20:34.530 - 00:20:44.210, Speaker C: And. Yeah, so we have a very good track record in that respect. In terms of your first question, my team, we have been working together.
00:20:46.020 - 00:20:46.384, Speaker A: For.
00:20:46.422 - 00:21:06.196, Speaker C: Now almost ten years, right. We started work at the beginning of 2012, end of 2011. That's when I left high finance. I used to work, as they say, for the devil, but I actually had a decent time there. It was at Goldman Sachs. I really enjoyed it, I learned a lot. And then we obviously built a lot of financial technologies after 2014.
00:21:06.196 - 00:21:33.948, Speaker C: Our origins are in financial education, and then we got into algorithm development. Today, if you actually kind of Google us, you find a bit more about us. Spectre is our crown jewel. It's kind of what our team is growing up. My personal responsibility is equally on the investing side. So we are with Hatchworks, which is a venture capital and incubator firm. And you can also find all details about various team members there, about us.
00:21:33.948 - 00:21:45.350, Speaker C: So we're actually investors ourselves, right. In the space we have a macro portfolio, we also have a micro portfolio and a defi portfolio. But that's things we do, obviously.
00:21:47.800 - 00:21:48.164, Speaker A: To.
00:21:48.202 - 00:22:23.260, Speaker C: Just keep kind of the wheels churning and yeah, I would say it's an exciting time to be back in the limelight. It's been three years, we've hit a lot of roadmap targets. We have a pretty close knit community. If you look at our telegram channel, a few thousand token holders, and very importantly, again, not to shill our token or anything like that, but very importantly, unlike a lot of defi projects, and maybe they're going down the right route, our route is a bit different, we're a bit more traditional. We believe cash return is king.
00:22:23.340 - 00:22:23.584, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:23.622 - 00:23:11.312, Speaker C: I mean, we're not so much about inflating our tokens and paying out in tokens. And that's why if you look at our token, it currently has a yield of just maybe 5% gross, 3% net. But the bottom line is we have actually returned a very substantial amount of cash back to token holders since, and driven by volumes, business volumes and investment income over three years. So that's what I can say for us. I think the platform itself, from a trader's perspective, is really interesting to use. I would encourage anyone who's interested in generation of risk adjusted return to actually create a demo account, get comfortable with it, spend months on it, right? You don't have to deposit real money. And when you see you're making money on demo, if you're good at it, then you can actually take the next step.
00:23:11.312 - 00:23:26.150, Speaker C: But I will say again, we are close to us citizens because we have licenses in place. And more importantly, we only allow real money trading after Kyc. So don't shoot me, but this is a requirement for us.
00:23:26.520 - 00:23:26.884, Speaker A: Cool.
00:23:26.922 - 00:23:29.210, Speaker B: Yeah, makes a lot of sense.
00:23:29.980 - 00:23:30.484, Speaker A: Sweet.
00:23:30.532 - 00:23:44.670, Speaker B: And so you kind of spoke about it. Where's the best place for the audience to kind of join this community and kind of explore? I know there's a lot of people that are based in the US that are itching. They're like, what's wrong with the website?
00:23:47.680 - 00:24:12.432, Speaker C: Here's the sad thing. I'll tell you a little about this, but in short, go to Spectre AI. WW Spectre AI. Go ahead and create a platform for the US clients. We would love to offer the service to you, but we simply cannot because we would need a FINRA license, we would need a CFTC license, and we would love to do this, let's say in a few years from now when we actually have regulatory approval. At this moment, we do not. So it's very, very strict.
00:24:12.432 - 00:24:18.500, Speaker C: Our KYC, in terms of who can join a us citizen trying to access our platform, will actually find a dead website.
00:24:18.570 - 00:24:18.804, Speaker A: Right?
00:24:18.842 - 00:24:47.200, Speaker C: So they'll probably think it's an exit scam. But if you use a VPN, you can actually go to our website and see what we're all about if you're based in the US. But unfortunately, to trade, that wouldn't be allowed. And I do apologize for that. But we will be working towards this in the future. Very interested in that market in the future. But right now, the bulk of our growth, and I think Chainlink also has a good sizable portion of its user base outside of the US.
00:24:47.200 - 00:25:15.592, Speaker C: So we're very interested in that. We are currently in the process of opening an office in Brazil. We opened, our primary office is in Indonesia. And we are currently looking to hire one more head of business development, our main head of business development, who currently could make the call. He's based in Asia. He's actually growing the platform out. But we are looking for someone sort of westward facing as well.
00:25:15.592 - 00:25:38.720, Speaker C: So it's an exciting time. And if you want to join, know, just write to IR at Spectre AI, which is investor relations at Spectre AI, but use IR and then we'll give you all the access details to our community. We don't have a discord. We have a telegram chat. It's kind of a long winded link, but I can leave that with you later. And then you can let the community know.
00:25:38.870 - 00:25:39.232, Speaker A: Cool.
00:25:39.286 - 00:26:01.896, Speaker B: No, thanks a lot for sharing. A lot of people in crypto, they're thinking, like, what's next three weeks down the road? I think it really shows the sustainability and a lot of promise that you're thinking long term, where will we be three years? And what do we need to do now to comply with the way society actually really works to be able to do this?
00:26:01.998 - 00:26:35.256, Speaker C: It's so true. It's like I look at DeFi and we're very excited by the changes that are happening. Where we pause for thought or we have a cause for concern to a certain degree, is a lot of these projects have fantastic ideas, usually disruptive ideas, to the extent that someone like the CEO of binance came out and said, we have an existentialist threat with this type of business model that is out there. I won't mention names, but I think we both know which one I'm referring to. And the issue with these is that it's theirs to lose.
00:26:35.308 - 00:26:35.572, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:35.626 - 00:26:46.310, Speaker C: I mean, it's theirs to lose if they don't stick to regulations, because regulations can be absolutely fierce. And so, yeah, we're taking the long view on this. Definitely.
00:26:47.260 - 00:26:48.010, Speaker A: Cool.
00:26:48.540 - 00:27:07.980, Speaker B: One question from the audience. So you're past working at Goldman Sachs in the legacy banking system. Where do you see kind of blockchain fitting into this? And how do you think it's going to affect how legacy banking works and the future of banking?
00:27:08.800 - 00:27:37.528, Speaker C: Look, I'll put it this way, the thing about the banksters, and I call them banksters, use the term colloquially, is that these guys, and having been one myself, they are smart, right? Way, way smarter than me. And the thing is, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan commercial banks, which, by the way, their business model is now being threatened with the central bank digital currencies, you may have heard about that. They're not going to just bend over and take it. They never have in the last 2300 years.
00:27:37.614 - 00:27:38.250, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:38.620 - 00:28:01.324, Speaker C: What they are doing is they are probably going to go to these revolutionary high traction platforms. I won't mention names, but we all know what they are. Maybe even chain link, right? Hopefully for you guys, although you guys have your billionaires anyway, so congratulations. But they will come to these type of platforms and just buy them out. That is my personal view.
00:28:01.362 - 00:28:01.660, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:01.730 - 00:28:14.668, Speaker C: And of course, people can say, well, you can't really buy out a protocol or this team is hidden. It's a protocol. What are they going to buy? Yeah. Then the risk is, if you are just a protocol and you don't have defensible technology with the IP, then they'll just recreate it.
00:28:14.774 - 00:28:15.284, Speaker A: Right?
00:28:15.402 - 00:28:39.680, Speaker C: You remember the run on Uniswap by sushi or sushi master, right? Ring a bell? They were scared. Now, Uniswap did a fantastic move there by issuing their token. It was a good defensive flare. And now things seem to have stabilized. And well done to the savvy team of Uniswap. And the venture capital firm that invested in them. Might have had bit of a sleepless night or two there, but they seem to have stabilized.
00:28:39.680 - 00:29:22.040, Speaker C: The thing that was. Imagine this. Look what happened to Uniswap with sushi master doing that to them. You saw what can happen. Now imagine if Goldman Sachs or one of these people or these banks actually feel threatened by any of these technologies. They will appeal to the human spirit, the greed which is at the core of many founders in Defi, which we see with the rug pulls, and they will just do a buyout offer that they cannot refuse, or they will just make that technology irrelevant by spending billions at a better protocol, or the same protocol with better marketing. Look, and sorry if we're running over time, but I think it's a really good question you've asked, and I want to take a bit of time to answer this.
00:29:22.040 - 00:29:28.456, Speaker C: Uniswap's be all and end all and its entire lifeblood are its liquidity providers. We agree on that.
00:29:28.478 - 00:29:28.664, Speaker A: Right?
00:29:28.702 - 00:29:36.044, Speaker C: It's lps, these lps. Some of them left to sushi overnight. So there is no real loyalty here.
00:29:36.082 - 00:29:36.284, Speaker A: Right?
00:29:36.322 - 00:29:53.548, Speaker C: It's all about the money. Imagine if someone comes in like Amazon. Amazon was running Amazon for 20 years as a lost leader, crushing retailers on the street. Their investors were saying, what the hell's going on? And Jeff said, watch. And look what happened today. Amazon is in a different league. They're profitable completely in a different league.
00:29:53.548 - 00:30:14.356, Speaker C: So what I'm saying is, big banks, if they fear blockchain, they are already making the moves to run these networks, competitive networks, as loss leaders offer the liquidity providers much better incentives, even if it means they take a margin hit. And they do that until they basically get rid of all the teams. That's the worst case scenario.
00:30:14.388 - 00:30:14.536, Speaker A: Right?
00:30:14.558 - 00:30:19.236, Speaker C: I'm not saying this is never going to happen, but most people, most ceos in this space would tell you. Keenan.
00:30:19.348 - 00:30:19.624, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:19.662 - 00:30:31.464, Speaker C: DeFi is going to disrupt Goldman Sachs, the new banking, legacy. Banking is dead. I'm actually saying, be very careful. Let us not get arrogant about this. The best thing to do is actually work with them. That's smarter.
00:30:31.592 - 00:30:32.076, Speaker A: Right?
00:30:32.178 - 00:30:37.564, Speaker C: And, you know, Sun Tzu said it the best if the enemy is more powerful. Split and reevaluate.
00:30:37.612 - 00:30:37.824, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:37.862 - 00:31:10.628, Speaker C: You can't take on the entire banking sector. I think it's best to work with them and very importantly, work with regulations. Otherwise you will just get shut. You know, here's the interesting thing. I had this discussion with a community member or two in my chat. I get attacked quite often for being a realist and not an idealist. And the point is, ultimately you are going up against a trillion dollar foe, if you want to call it a very established player.
00:31:10.628 - 00:31:35.276, Speaker C: And all these players have invested heavily in blockchain in the last two to three years. A lot of these players have also wound down their blockchain programs, you would agree, right? And there's a reason behind that. Not that there's nothing in the technology, but it's just. It's not as freaking amazing in its current non scalable form as people think. It's just not right now. Post ETH 2.0 and other sort of layering solutions and sharding solutions.
00:31:35.276 - 00:32:05.080, Speaker C: It may get there, but I would say now, finally, I answer your question. Sorry for the long winded responses. DFI has a fantastic future, but not in its current state. I think the DFI leaders of tomorrow, some of them are going to be around in a big way. But I would say that 99% of the teams that we are backing today simply won't be around because there's an attitude adjustment needed to actually understand the magnitude and scope of what they're trying to change. Right. With uniswap, I'm very impressed.
00:32:05.080 - 00:32:43.172, Speaker C: I'm very impressed how they are kind of moving through it. The thing that I don't agree with, whether it matters or not, what I agree with or not, but is the fact that ultimately I believe in teams need to be transparent. They need to show themselves. That goes for so much. And this whole we're a protocol, we're hiding, that's not going to work for too long right now. If you are based in the US offering regulated services without KYC to millions of Americans, and I'm not saying anyone's doing that, but if they are, that to me is an existentialist threat. It's an existentialist threat.
00:32:43.236 - 00:32:43.512, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:43.566 - 00:33:16.150, Speaker C: It just is. And so if the DFI people can say that, okay, we want to survive, we want to have a big share of finance in the next ten years, just play a little bit by the book, and then I think big things can happen with Chainlink. I think it's interesting because your business model is agnostic, right? You're not giving investment advice. You're not a trading platform. You guys are just saying, look, we have really good quality price feeds and in theory you can have a million partners in the future, right? So it's a good hedged play into this space.
00:33:17.240 - 00:33:17.652, Speaker A: Cool.
00:33:17.706 - 00:33:21.030, Speaker B: No, thanks a lot for that answer. Really appreciate it.
00:33:21.480 - 00:33:22.032, Speaker A: Sweet.
00:33:22.096 - 00:33:43.928, Speaker B: Kay, well, yeah, I think that's our time. So everyone that's listening in, I'll make sure to drop all these links in the description afterwards. Again, Kay, really appreciate you coming on and for the really insightful insights into your background and kind of where things are going and about your platform and really excited to see it grow over the next months and years to come. Really appreciate your time.
00:33:44.014 - 00:33:44.904, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:33:45.102 - 00:33:52.528, Speaker B: Yeah, cool. And otherwise, thanks a lot everyone who joined us today and we'll see you next time.
00:33:52.694 - 00:33:55.020, Speaker C: Thank you everyone. Bye.
