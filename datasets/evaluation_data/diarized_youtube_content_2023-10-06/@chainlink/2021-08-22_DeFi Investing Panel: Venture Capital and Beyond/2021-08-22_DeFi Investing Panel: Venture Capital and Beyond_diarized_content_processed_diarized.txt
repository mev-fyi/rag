00:00:05.130 - 00:00:53.642, Speaker A: Welcome to our DeFi investing panel. We've got some of the best minds in the business here with us to have a really interesting conversation about the state of DeFi investing. Everything you ever wanted to know about how a venture capitalist in the crypto space thinks about DeFi projects. My name is David Post. I lead corporate development and strategy for Chainlink Labs. Very pumped to have this esteemed group of investors on this panel, and I think it's going to be a very interesting conversation and hopefully provide a lot of input to anybody thinking about starting a blockchain project, wondering what trends are in the DeFi market, and understanding some of the key determinants of success or failure of projects in the crypto space. So as we get started, just wanted to provide some introductions.
00:00:53.642 - 00:01:09.570, Speaker A: So I'm going to ask each of the panelists to just provide a brief intro and also talk about what you think will be the most exciting trends in DFI from an investment perspective over the next twelve months. So why don't we start with Santiago?
00:01:10.870 - 00:01:32.220, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks David. Great to be here. I'm a partner at Parfi Capital. We focus almost exclusively on DFI at the intersection of d five, web3. Our approach is to be first and foremost users of these protocols, and that really kind of informs our thesis as to what's working, what needs to be built, and so, yeah, happy to be here.
00:01:33.310 - 00:01:41.130, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. And what's the trend you think is most exciting in DFI over the next twelve months or the first couple of top trends?
00:01:41.950 - 00:02:14.518, Speaker B: I think capital efficiency is one. Obviously everyone knows that over collateralization is required in the space. I think as we scale out different blockchains is quite interesting. I think there are certain use cases that have been very difficult to scale in the current Ethereum landscape. But as other blockchains and l two s launch, I think it's going to be quite interesting and generally just, I think from our vantage point we see a lot of interest from traditional financial institutions in a record low interest rate environment to play in DeFi. So those would be three.
00:02:14.684 - 00:02:21.690, Speaker A: Awesome. Next, sin Shu, if you could provide an intro and talk about some of the top trends you're seeing in DeFi from an investment perspective.
00:02:22.110 - 00:03:02.178, Speaker C: Sure. My name is Xing Shu. I'm a partner at IOC Ventures. So as an early stage venture fund, we are very active in working with early stage projects in DeFi, social coins and NFT. I think we believe that DeFi is going to really getting more and more mature. So a lot of micro innovation I think will come some of the things San Diego has already rightly put it. And I think another interesting thing we are going to see is that as yield over the overall yield is coming down, we are really going to see the DeFi applications that are going to be really used regardless of yield.
00:03:02.178 - 00:03:21.580, Speaker C: And to that sense, I think a few top projects will really emerge and establish their position, and we are also going to see some of the newer ones that are coming to challenge all these top projects. So a lot of interesting battles we are expecting to see, I guess.
00:03:22.510 - 00:03:34.278, Speaker A: Thanks. That's good context. Next, Imran, and in addition to talking about your top DeFi trends, also, if you could just give our audience here a little bit of background on the DeFi lines and your mission and objectives.
00:03:34.394 - 00:03:55.080, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you. Name is Imran. I'm one of the leads at the DeFi alliance. We have two areas of focus. The first is supporting startups as they're building their products and getting to product market fit. And we help them in three areas. One is liquidity provisioning, two is product feedback, and three is regulatory support.
00:03:55.080 - 00:04:50.390, Speaker D: The second area of focus is we operate a consortium, and this consortium is a mix of law firms, ecosystem providers within crypto, and more traditional financial firms. And the goal there is to identify areas of opportunities where we can work together in working groups and help solve for DeFi startups. So one of which is our current regulatory landscape and how we should be governed, whether the regulator should govern us or should we govern ourselves. And so those are some of the topics that we're thinking about. And now, in regards to the way we think about Defi and some of the upcoming trends, I think both Sinchu and Santiago nailed it in terms of capital efficiency. And you could probably get a little bit deeper and think about identity and reputation of how this could be interact, how users can leverage that in a way to interact with the different ecosystems around it. So defi is one, nfts, metaverses, et cetera.
00:04:50.390 - 00:05:34.920, Speaker D: And so we're going to start to see a lot of interesting experiments from that perspective. Crosschain infrastructure is also another one, as you can see with Thor and others, they're kind of on a bleeding edge, and they're focusing a lot of energy on figuring out how this works and making sure that it's safe and secure. So I think that's the second area that we've been looking at, like cross chain infrastructure. And I'd say third is going to be traditional financial firms and what they're looking for. Right. And so we're getting a lot of inbound in regards to what does Ave look like from a permission perspective, et cetera. So I think that's another area that we're starting to see more interest in.
00:05:35.290 - 00:05:46.940, Speaker A: Let's just stay with you, Imran, since we're talking already. So what advice would you give to founders in relation to how to most effectively engage with the venture community and start launching a crypto project?
00:05:48.190 - 00:06:31.660, Speaker D: I think first and foremost, this product, right. If you're going out for a raise, have an idea of what you want to build, get to an MVP and start to get feedback in regards to the area of opportunities where you want to go next. Sometimes we see sponsors that are incredibly excited about what they want to build and raise before they actually build an MVP. In my regard, for me personally, I'd like to see an MVP get feedback, support, and then start to kind of scale up. And so I would say one feedback is get feedback in regards to the MVP and kind of scale up from there.
00:06:32.270 - 00:06:42.800, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, essentially, same question. If you were to give founders advice about how to most effectively engage with the venture community, what would be the key things that founders should keep in mind?
00:06:43.490 - 00:07:28.170, Speaker C: I think one thing, to be honest, I still see like a gap or divide between the developer community or the founder community versus the funds. I think things have certainly been improved significantly. But still, I think one advice is that founders can treat investors as your partners. You are really trying to choose which ones you are going to work with for the next months to years. You are not just presenting the most rosy part of your idea and try to get the money, because money is really commodity. You can get it in many places, but really you are looking for someone who you can trust, who can give you wisdom, and who can even back you up when things are not that good. Right.
00:07:28.170 - 00:07:33.870, Speaker C: I think that's the main advice I like to share with, especially new founders.
00:07:34.290 - 00:07:49.170, Speaker A: Thanks. In Santiago, kind of building off of that point. Take us through your thought process for when you're assessing whether or not to invest in projects. What are you looking for? How does your internal process work? Just give our audience an idea of how this kind of works behind the scenes.
00:07:50.070 - 00:08:50.674, Speaker B: Yeah, very succinctly. I'm looking for unique insight and crystallized in a sentence or two, and I think a lot of people struggle with that. What is their edge? And a lot of times I think to everyone's point, look, it's a world of open source. It's a great opportunity and a challenge for founders. Right. When you can utilize a lot of the technology and parts of the stack that have been built, but oftentimes I stumble upon founders that are really passionate but haven't really done the homework in terms of canvassing what's out there, what's working, haven't really used a competitive product, and it's not a very satisfactory answer when you tell them, hey, have you looked at, if you're doing crossbridge chains, for instance, and to everyone's point, just to go off of that, have you looked at Thorchain? What is the issue with thorchain that you're to have? Like, I like to see a lot of focus from a founder because a lot of times in crypto, there's no shortage of ambition. I find there's no shortage of grand visions.
00:08:50.674 - 00:09:15.866, Speaker B: Right. That's decentralized. But I think inherently you need to sort of stay focused on a three year, like on a three month horizon. The next three months are singularly focused on this and maniacally focused on this. And I think if you're not that way, you're going to be pulled in a million. Know, at the stage that we're investing in, where I love interacting with founders in, this is super early. And I think the best founders have that vision.
00:09:15.866 - 00:09:29.022, Speaker B: Like you talked to Sergey early, early on, he had a very concrete vision of Chainlink. And I think that is really, I think, kind of resonated with the people that saw that. So when you see it from a founder, you sort of latch on to that, but it's rare to find.
00:09:29.156 - 00:09:46.280, Speaker A: Yeah, and tell me just about the internal process. So someone comes and pitches you an idea, they get on the phone or they get on Zoom. I guess at this point, the founders that I talk to have to do this 20, 30, 40 times. What happens after the call, when they've explained the idea to you? What does your internal process look like?
00:09:46.810 - 00:10:13.674, Speaker B: Yeah. So I've sort of architected a program internally at verify where I want to minimize bias. So a lot of times it's only one partner or one analyst or one principal on the call. And the reason being is when I ask a question, the questions that I ask really dictate the kind of answers and are very much a leading question. Right. An analyst might pick up on certain cues or my intonation in my voice. And so a lot of what I want to minimize is really value, an independent process to do diligence.
00:10:13.674 - 00:10:56.474, Speaker B: And so we do a round of questions and there's really just one lead that does all the work. And then at the very end, we bring in the team. If we go through multiple rounds of diligence, technical product. We might socialize with a few of our partners, like the Defi alliance or our friends out in Asia. So we like to bring in other founders as well that are going to complement the round. And then after that we bring in the team to meet the entire team that's going to be supporting them. But for a lot of times, I think it really is about owning all of the diligence for us to avoid kind of traps and certain cognitive biases that inherently in your diligence process can arise.
00:10:56.474 - 00:10:58.160, Speaker B: And so try to minimize those.
00:10:58.530 - 00:11:06.900, Speaker A: Got it. Thanks for that insight. Amron, is your process similar to what Santiago described? What happens after the pitch, in other words?
00:11:07.990 - 00:12:47.940, Speaker D: Yeah, we typically have a investor committee meeting where we have all of the stakeholders within the DeFi alliance and we just dig deeper in regards to what are the areas of opportunities that are missing in Defi. Are there duplicative efforts happening elsewhere? What were the results? What are other firms looking for in regards to what the startup is building? And then we dive deeper on the technical infrastructure perspective because a lot of the products that we see is going to be a genesis of how they build the product from a technical perspective. And then finally, the biggest question that we ask our founders is, what is the secret that you know, that no one else knows? And Santiago alluded to this earlier, which is like, if the founder doesn't have incredible vision or an innovative idea that they can build, that no one else is building, then anyone else can easily copy and kind of outcompete. And that's already happening in the ecosystem today. Zapper, as an example, was just a wallet that could show you your portfolio, and now they're swapping assets, they're showing your nfts, they are gamifying experiences, and they're going to do a lot more. And so I think we're still in this evolutionary process of figuring out where is all of these products and how do they all fit. And over time, a lot of what we see today that look like individual products are going to start to overlap and look like it's one.
00:12:48.310 - 00:13:01.350, Speaker A: Exactly. So I think you have to know what the, so what you're saying, if I get distilled, is you have to know the secret. And you also have a perspective in terms of how the secret evolves over time, because where you start obviously isn't where you end up necessarily from a business perspective.
00:13:02.330 - 00:13:13.290, Speaker D: It doesn't matter what chain you build on also, right? Because ultimately founders will bootstrap on other networks, and so you have to have an edge a secret.
00:13:14.030 - 00:13:30.110, Speaker A: Got it. Let me kind of ask you something. So all of the investors on this panel have a reputation for really getting in the trenches with founders and working with them over time. So can you talk a little bit about your approach to working with founders to drive results?
00:13:30.690 - 00:14:15.534, Speaker C: So I think we try to take a tailored approach or solution to different founders. Some founders are just very clear. We talk to them in the beginning, then there's a vision and a plan of execution of he or she go. And sometimes during the process the founders might need specific things. It could be something about liquidity provision, it could be about partnerships with some of the projects for integration, and sometimes it could be even about building a community in Asia or getting listed on some of the exchanges to help with these things. So that's, I think, the bulk of the project founders we work with, that's the mode. But sometimes other founders might need different kinds of help.
00:14:15.572 - 00:14:15.774, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:15.812 - 00:14:50.970, Speaker C: So, for example, they don't have much issue in terms of execution, but they just want someone to brainstorm together with them on the next big thing they want to build. So we do that as well. And I think we just try to provide whatever kind of help that's most needed by the founders. And sometimes it includes very specific things, even technical kind of support and instructions to legal firms. It can be as practical as that. Yeah, it depends.
00:14:51.790 - 00:14:52.154, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:52.192 - 00:15:14.260, Speaker A: And kind of. Santiago, kind of an offshoot of that mean. Do you believe that there's kind of a blueprint for how you should think about as a founder in terms of putting a crypto project together? My observation has been that everyone kind of tries to launch in a kind of bespoke fashion. So do you think that there is a recipe in terms of how you should launch a crypto project?
00:15:16.230 - 00:15:54.362, Speaker B: It's a great question. I don't know. I think the only blueprint is to keep an open mind. And for instance, a lot of founders say, hey, what's worked for Defi blue chip project x? And you're like, well, wait on, hold on a minute. The ecosystem was very different a year ago than what it is today. I think users today expect a token users today expect a liquidity mining program. But that's not to say that I feel like my best advice is not to be very prescriptive, first of all, with founders, second of all is just your product is very different if you're an amm, if you're a wallet, if you're an aggregator, a derivatives protocol.
00:15:54.362 - 00:16:43.050, Speaker B: So I think you can borrow a lot of elements, but ultimately I think the key insight, I think, for me, is at the end of the day, all of these are communities first. And so the really successful protocols have been very in touch with their community, and the community will. The nice thing about a user in crypto is he's very vocal and he will tell you what he wants, and if you screw up a particular product rollout or feature, he's going to tell you that. And so I think my best advice is really engage with the community and build a community. Index is a great example. I think that's a protocol that's relatively young because a lot of founders come to me and say, well, okay, great. Like, chain is a great community, but how do I get there? I think there are good examples of protocols that have built good communities and have allowed members of the community to step up and rise to the occasion, because, again, you really want to prioritize a sufficiently decentralized network and a lot of community engagement.
00:16:43.050 - 00:17:58.822, Speaker B: So I think there are some parameters around token economics and what the market wants. Not optimizing just for user acquisition, but also retention. Right. A lot of these Defi protocols have a liquidity mining component, which is whether you want to distribute tokens or you want to tie certain activity in the protocol and reward active users all that's great. But I think a lot, most protocols that I see today are just really kind of singularly focused on this very near term objective of how do I get the biggest TDL and how do I win? It's like, well, yeah, but you're going to kind of blow your load and you're going to give users all these tokens, but are they going to stick around? Are they going to be like, what about the retention piece two, three years down the road? And so I think, again, just to sum it up, you need to be both thinking in the near term, but also in the long term, especially when it comes to monetary policy, especially when it comes to token design, because you don't want to be in a position where you codify these things and then three years down the road, you don't have resources in the dow to give out to other partners because D five is going to look very different in three years, four years time. So keep that sort of flexibility in anything and everything that you do.
00:17:58.956 - 00:18:01.480, Speaker A: I think it'll probably look very different in six months time.
00:18:02.090 - 00:18:03.160, Speaker B: 100%.
00:18:04.570 - 00:18:17.980, Speaker A: Ron, same question. Is there kind of a blueprint that you see for launching these types of projects successfully? Do you kind of agree with Santiago that some of it is you can drop on, but you have to be ready to customize and kind of be unique on certain parameters. What are you?
00:18:18.830 - 00:18:50.262, Speaker D: I like community is incredibly important, right. Because they are going to be the long term stakeholders moving forward. So that's like number one. Number two is, I always tell founders, don't launch your token or your liquidity mining program first, right. You launch your product and you get feedback and support, get product market fit and double down with the liquidity mining program later on. You could see this working really well. Like ribbon Finance is one that's launched a great product.
00:18:50.262 - 00:19:27.034, Speaker D: They've reached between $50 to $75 million in TVL before they actually incentivized a token. And they did that for a very short time. And they're doing this in kind of like a blitzcaling motion, which is like, we want to test this and see if this works really well and let's get to 100 million. And they did it. You could think of other projects that are doing that as well. DYDX, they haven't launched a token yet and they've done $4 billion in volume, notional volume, and they haven't launched a token yet. And imagine once they launch a token where they're going to go next, right.
00:19:27.034 - 00:19:51.538, Speaker D: So I think you're giving up equity in your company if you think about it, right. If you want to give it to the right people and the right stakeholders, you should give it to the users of your protocol, reward them heavily versus giving it to yo farmers. Not saying that there's anything wrong with it, and I think you should have yield farmers, but has to be done in a healthier way. And I think that's probably the way that's good insights.
00:19:51.554 - 00:20:31.430, Speaker A: And it seems like, once again, it seems like the way I view it is there's kind of like different steps in your project plan. And step one, you have options, one, two and three, and you have to understand what the advantages and disadvantages are. So I think that there are probably some common decision parameters. And within those decision parameters there's a couple of different choices, kind of like a choose your own adventure book. And you have to figure out how these different pieces are going to fit together. So I think those are very interesting insights. So since you, we don't like to see when projects don't succeed, but you've been investing for a long time in this space, what do you think are some of the primary reasons that projects do not manage to succeed or that they fail?
00:20:32.410 - 00:21:03.034, Speaker C: I think one reason could be compliance and regulatory issues or risks. Right. That's something we have seen and that's very straightforward to understand. But let's say other than that, another issue is sometimes lack of leadership. I say that because I'm just echoing. The other speakers have just said I think it's very important to engage the community. The reason being that I think product market fate in the crypto space sometimes is a moving target.
00:21:03.034 - 00:21:20.354, Speaker C: So as a founder, you have to take the leadership. You have to constantly review your direction, your vision. Right. It's not like you set some goal, and then that's it. People naturally, automatically just take your product and use it. It's not like that. Sometimes you have to adjust and even pivot.
00:21:20.354 - 00:21:54.122, Speaker C: Right. You have to take the leadership of that. What I see sometimes for certain projects, that somehow they got stuck at a particular thing and they believe this is something very cool to build. But whether the market likes it, whether the community will use it, that doesn't seem to be the priority, or they feel we can worry about it later. I think that's the issue. So sometimes it's very obvious, like there's a market demand, so you just build that. But sometimes you also need to explore and navigate a particular niche where it's going to attract a lot of users.
00:21:54.122 - 00:22:13.430, Speaker C: And sometimes maybe, yes, the founders are right, this is something that's going to be needed by the market, but then you need to educate the market. So taking that kind of leadership by the founders, I think, is the key to success and failure to do so sometimes, unfortunately, will result at least much less success of the project, as I see.
00:22:13.580 - 00:22:25.500, Speaker A: I think that's a good insight. Santiago, same question. What do you see your advice to founders? What are the biggest things you see projects trip up on in terms of trying to get to a high degree of scale and success?
00:22:26.830 - 00:22:55.054, Speaker B: Yeah, just going off of what I think we discussed earlier is no amount of financial engineering solves for a crappy product. This is Embren's point. Look at uniswap. Single handedly, the most popular defi protocol for a long time, didn't have a token. And so I think it's product first. It's always product. That deficit, just in technical debt, cannot be absolved by any amount of financial engineering.
00:22:55.054 - 00:23:25.102, Speaker B: So it's difficult, because if you don't have a token, you may be at a disadvantage. No question about it. I think in this world, users expect it, but I think founders can be too quick. And Imran alluded to this earlier around launching a pre product in a token. Like tokens are powerful. I'm certainly of the mind that tokens went through this phase after 2017, that they're a scam at the end of the day, blockchains are coordination mechanisms. You need a transfer of value to coordinate people.
00:23:25.102 - 00:23:50.146, Speaker B: Otherwise, no one cares. The token is that wrapper. Use it wisely, don't rush into it. And I'll give concrete examples. Look at what Uma is doing with their a B, testing certain token designs and programs. Ultimately, they're using their treasury in a very, I think, strategic way. And we proposed, for instance, a liquidity mining program for Ave.
00:23:50.146 - 00:24:14.222, Speaker B: It was only three months. Why? Because, I don't know. I'm not perfect. I've designed a lot of these. But the state of DeFi is constantly in flux. And so again, if you don't need to codify stuff like monetary policy or an inflation curve, don't do it, even though users might want you to do it, just don't do it because you want to retain flexibility. In a world of open source, then anyone can copy your code.
00:24:14.222 - 00:25:02.330, Speaker B: You would have talked to the maker guys. Being first in crypto sometimes is not the best, because then a lot of projects copy that and then iterate on that. And I think even the maker team would tell you, look, we're kind of the bedrock of DFI. We're the stablecoin, but there are ten other different stablecoin protocols that are. We didn't nail it from the get go. And I think going first, I commend it, but at the same time, don't rush into codifying certain things. And I think at the end of the day, if your North Star is creating a product that users want, and you listen to the community and really kind of adapt around that, I think the best protocols in Defi, you were to look back and you say they're very much in tune, their discord is bombing, and they're constantly rolling out features and even empowering community members to build around the protocol.
00:25:03.150 - 00:25:28.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I think those are great insights. Unfortunately, we have reached the end of our time. I think that this conversation could go on much longer. I know. I've really appreciated the insights. We have really enjoyed getting to know all of you over the past couple of months, and we're going to be working on some things that will be announced in the future more systematically together to support both chainlinks ecosystem and also the Defi ecosystem in general. So thank you for your time.
00:25:29.530 - 00:25:32.610, Speaker B: Thank you, David, and thank you to the entire panel for your insights.
