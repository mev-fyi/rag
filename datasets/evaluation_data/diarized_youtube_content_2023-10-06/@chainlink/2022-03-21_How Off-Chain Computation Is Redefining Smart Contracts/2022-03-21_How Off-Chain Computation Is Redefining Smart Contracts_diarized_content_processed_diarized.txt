00:00:02.090 - 00:01:24.520, Speaker A: So a hybrid smart contract is basically redefining what we consider to be a smart contract. Before, we might have considered a smart contract to be one contract about tokenization, and then might have moved on to being about one contract about tokenization and another about dow voting, and another one about multisig security, another one about something else. What we're basically saying is that the more advanced contracts are actually a composition of both on chain code running in a blockchain, or even multiple blockchains, and off chain trust minimized code running in a decentralized oracle network. A decentralized oracle network is basically a committee of nodes that comes to consensus about various computations but does not have a blockchain. It does not generate a blockchain. It simply generates consensus about certain key inputs or computations that don't need a blockchain but do need to be given to a blockchain in order for a smart contract to do something useful. Generally speaking, the way this architecture is evolving is once again just like initially, the entire conception of a smart contract might have been one smart contract, and then it moved on to two smart contracts interacting with each other, maybe about tokenization and voting, and then defi expanded it to those two contracts relying on a data feed about off chain data.
00:01:24.520 - 00:01:53.420, Speaker A: Now, what we're seeing is both an expansion in the amount of contracts on chain as individual services that need to interoperate with each other to be composed into more and more advanced applications, and a greater amount of off chain services, whether that's the provision of data, whether that's the provision of computation, or whether that's the provision of random numbers, cross chain any number of other key services. So.
