00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker B: You.
00:00:01.890 - 00:00:14.350, Speaker A: In 2021, your team announced that several enterprises like Deutsche Telecom, Swisscom, the Associated Press, and AccuWeather had launched Chainlink nodes. Can you explain how and why these companies are participating in the Chainlink network?
00:00:15.090 - 00:01:30.370, Speaker B: Sure. I think fundamentally, it's the economics of the Chainlink network, because all of these companies, Swisscom, Deutsche Telecom, Associated Press, AccuWeather, all of them have done very significant analysis on the smart contract economy and the market for either their data or their computational capabilities. And I think that what they got from that analysis was that not only is there an existingly large enough market with sufficiently strong enough economics to have them provide their data to it, but it's a rapidly growing market, growing from below 1 trillion to well over 2 trillion in a very small time period. So the market size of where they can provide their data and their ability to provide their computation is much larger than it was before. The second reason is the efficiency through which they can provide that through the chainlink network. So we have an extremely efficient way for them to simply plug in their existing data, plug in their existing infrastructure, and give people the security of their computations, the quality of their data for weather with AccuWeather, or news for Associated Press or others. And then what that does is it closes that chicken and egg cycle, where if you don't have high quality infrastructure, you can't really build high quality applications.
00:01:30.370 - 00:01:57.050, Speaker B: But once the Associated Press, once AccuWeather, once various other data and computational providers provide infrastructure through something like the Chainlink network, then you have an infrastructure that can give rise to decentralized insurance, better and better dynamic NFTs, more and more advanced Defi. That's really the cycle that Chainlink closes and accelerates, which is what we feel is our contribution to the smart contract economy.
