00:00:07.770 - 00:00:31.074, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. We have a great team here with trueflation. We have Ken, who leads up business development with the team. We have Zaji, myself here from Chainlay Labs. And we're really excited to unpack a little bit of what's been happening with the trueflation team, and especially on the back of what's happened on the back of Smartcon. Last year, a really exciting award was granted to these folks for building something really innovative. And we're going to hop into that momentarily.
00:00:31.074 - 00:00:37.174, Speaker A: But before we do so, we'd love to just hand it over to you, Ken, welcome to the you.
00:00:37.212 - 00:00:43.560, Speaker B: Thank you. So I can just do a quick explanation, if you like, of.
00:00:45.130 - 00:00:50.894, Speaker A: Sure thing. Yeah, it would be great to hear just a general overview of what you guys been working on.
00:00:51.012 - 00:01:22.390, Speaker B: Okay, so essentially, the short version is trueflation puts inflation data on chain, and obviously we use Chainlink. The longer version is we put us dollar inflation data on chain. And using the Chainlink oracles to do that has been. Obviously, I've been a fan of Chainlink for so long that it's never been an option to use anything else but Chainlink.
00:01:23.770 - 00:01:53.778, Speaker A: Yeah, man. So if you don't mind me asking, you guys were granted the award, the challenge that Bellagi set out at Smartcon last year, right? And so, if you don't mind, can we expand a little bit on what the behind the scenes look like of how you guys mobilize to bring some product like this to life? I mean, we're pretty much bringing relatively important index information that the rest of the world uses, but now making it in an open source and friendly to use way for web three. So just curious how you guys did that.
00:01:53.864 - 00:03:16.010, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think, like most people, we were concerned at the rising inflation, and we're kind of looking at developing technologies to help protect purchasing power for users of the dollar and stuff. And so the first thing that we had to do in order to do that was create a way to accurately gauge inflation data. And so that was kind of like, what was the impetus behind the idea? In addition to calls from other people, and also the call from Chainlink of Bellaji and the others, was motivated by that same desire to have an accurate gauge. So that's behind the scenes. Essentially, how it started was we need to protect people from inflation. And in order to do that, you have to first have to accurately diagnose what the inflation level is. And we found, in my opinion, I don't think the government CPI was ever meant for use with sophisticated financial instruments.
00:03:16.010 - 00:03:51.080, Speaker B: And it's more of a bellwether used by the federal government to gauge. Is inflation high or is it not? It was never meant to. At least this is my understanding, it was never meant to build sophisticated products on top of. So we needed something a little bit more live up to date, open and accurate according to what people are purchasing and spending money on. So that's really how it happened. It's pretty simple.
00:03:52.250 - 00:03:57.906, Speaker C: And through that process, were there things that maybe surprised you as you started building this consumer price index?
00:03:58.018 - 00:04:33.954, Speaker B: Yes. Okay, so the government CPI, the way they arrived at it, I had no thought. You know, it's the federal government, NSA, all that stuff. They collect all your data. I figured they had all these super sophisticated mechanisms, know they have every single piece of data out there and they use these supercomputers or whatever to develop these really accurate models. But that's not what happens. They use essentially surveys and they take a small amount, well, relatively small.
00:04:33.954 - 00:05:17.300, Speaker B: It's like tens of thousands of people across the country, 350,000,000 now. And they ask them essentially, what did you pay last year for product x and what did you pay this year for product x? And then they find that difference and that's how the CPI is. So for us, that wasn't as accurate or as fine tuned, I guess you could say, for the products that we were looking to build. But that was really what surprised me was I thought the government would be on top of the sophisticated data models, but that's not how it happens.
00:05:19.030 - 00:05:23.442, Speaker A: Yeah, well, thank you for explaining that. I actually didn't know myself.
00:05:23.576 - 00:05:24.994, Speaker B: Yeah, me neither.
00:05:25.192 - 00:05:26.500, Speaker C: Bit went too.
00:05:27.770 - 00:05:58.970, Speaker A: But I think the way you guys really distill it down is really user friendly. Using the application you guys have made, app trueflation.com, really easy to follow and really transparent in terms of the interface and the experience. You could really unpack all of these different ingredients to the index that you guys have come up with. So I'm curious to power that, I guess. Where in this whole equation does Chainlink come into the picture?
00:05:59.130 - 00:07:03.886, Speaker B: Okay, so as an oracle, Chainlink is obviously top tier, but we use Chainlink oracles to deliver the information. So essentially what we do is we take live data from APIs. The idea is to take data from a year ago. What price? From data aggregators and APIs, for example, zillow, you would get housing and rental data. What was it a year ago? And what are people paying today just for housing stuff? Real estate. And so we take all that data and there's tons of other data providers. We have like over 10 million data points that we aggregate into this larger algorithm, and then we crunch the numbers, I guess you could say, and then feed that onto the blockchain via chain link for use in smart contracts.
00:07:03.886 - 00:07:38.670, Speaker B: So that's where Chainlink comes in, is making it available to all the different chains for anyone that wanted to use inflation data. And there's a ton of. I know we haven't finished the hackathon yet, but we've gotten so many awesome submissions and projects for the chain link hackathon, I thought I'd mention that. It's really cool. The chain link community is super sick, and I've been a member of it forever, so I knew that. I see that swag.
00:07:42.610 - 00:07:56.130, Speaker C: That's awesome. And thanks for saying that. We're really excited to see what our community is building around all of this. But from your perspective, what is the goal for your community? What are you hoping that people will learn from the data that you're aggregating?
00:07:56.290 - 00:08:53.720, Speaker B: Well, we want to enable people. We want to give people the means to protect themselves from the ravages of inflation. They say that inflation is like a hidden tax, and it is kind of true. If inflation is at 10% and you make, just use a round number, $100,000, then you've lost 10% or $10,000 in purchasing power over a year. So that adds up and it compounds, and it's a real problem. And so we want to enable people the tools to protect themselves from these oftentimes undernoticed or hidden taxes from inflation. And that can come in the form of either using different tools that people have created with trueflation or even creating their own.
00:08:55.130 - 00:09:09.900, Speaker A: Yeah, and so, I mean, kind of just to expand on that, the community sentiment piece a little bit, ken, has there been any preference in terms of where they'd like to see what you're working on, expanding into a multi chain world or what chains are you guys operating with? Right.
00:09:10.910 - 00:10:08.654, Speaker B: Absolutely. So right now, we are on eth, obviously, and then avalanche and Polygon and BNB finance. So each chain has their pros and their cons. We've gotten a lot of interest in using, you could call them the l two s, or whatever polygon, for example, just because the fees are so much lower. And if you're using data daily and you're consuming or storing data on chain, that's really what people have been really receptive to. But I'd like to see it to where the data is available on every chain. And that's something that we're working on.
00:10:08.654 - 00:10:17.700, Speaker B: But luckily, because we use chain link, it's basically any chain anyone could want. But those are the chains that we're live right now.
00:10:18.310 - 00:10:19.346, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:10:19.528 - 00:10:30.646, Speaker C: Yeah, super nice. Thanks for expanding on that. And we did see congrats. Thought you wrapped up your seed round led by fundamental labs. So what are some use cases that you're working towards on that front?
00:10:30.828 - 00:11:40.574, Speaker B: So the trueflation CPI is so useful in a bunch of different ones. One of the things that I think is really cool is there's an opportunity to have a stablecoin proof or resistant of inflation. So like an inflation resistant stablecoin, I guess you could say so that it keeps up with the actual level of inflation rather than a standard stablecoin is going to just be at a dollar, but if inflation is taking 10%, then it's going to be lower than a dollar in a year. So that's one example. There's all sorts of, like there's prediction markets, there's options and futures and hedging opportunities for people. And by the way, one of the things that we're building is not just the US dollar, but the goal is to get to the entire world. We've got the UK and Canada coming, I think within the next month.
00:11:40.574 - 00:12:07.860, Speaker B: We've got some european countries, Germany included, and then we're also focusing on Latin America as well. And so that's an example of if there was a company that wanted to trade futures or options based on inflation rates at this or that level in inflation ravaged countries, that's a really useful tool.
00:12:09.450 - 00:12:18.940, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely relate to that. I'm personally from South America, so I can see why governments and people in those countries would be really interested in learning more. So it'll be interesting to see what.
00:12:20.110 - 00:12:21.706, Speaker B: What country?
00:12:21.888 - 00:12:26.700, Speaker C: Colombia. So definitely. Oh, nice.
00:12:27.550 - 00:12:30.362, Speaker B: I've been to Colombia a couple. Yeah, nice.
00:12:30.416 - 00:12:33.610, Speaker C: Yeah, Devcon this year. Hopefully a lot of people will be there.
00:12:33.760 - 00:12:35.930, Speaker B: Oh, what's the date?
00:12:36.080 - 00:12:40.094, Speaker C: It's in October and it's going to be in Columbia, so I think a lot of our community will be there.
00:12:40.212 - 00:12:50.850, Speaker B: Oh, really? Okay. I'm going to see if they'll send me. That'll be awesome. Is it in Bogota or. Sorry, there's a need.
00:12:51.000 - 00:12:54.420, Speaker A: You were just saying there's a need. You got to go and figure it out.
00:12:55.050 - 00:13:29.770, Speaker B: Absolutely. And Venezuela is right next to Colombia and they've been absolutely hammered by inflation. That's the goal. And that's the goal with web three or crypto in general, is to enable people. I know it's like a corny word, but really empower people the tools to create the means to protect themselves so that they don't have to trust these institutions, that they can build the means to protect themselves and interact directly with one another. And I think it's a legitimate dream.
00:13:29.930 - 00:13:53.910, Speaker A: Absolutely, man. And I think you were just kind of giving us maybe a little bit of an Easter egg of what maybe is ahead in terms of all of these other indices in other countries or other markets that could benefit of something like this. But I'm just curious, imaginatively speaking, are there other types of indices that you think could be done in a similar way to what you've done here from a consumer price perspective with this type of technology?
00:13:54.060 - 00:14:52.106, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So one from the CPI perspective, the way I see things moving is kind of like a Google Earth for inflation data. So you can zoom out and have, like, you could say global inflation, and then you could have it at the state level or like country level and then regional and then us state or province and then city and then zip code and just zoom in and out and have different levels of granularity with other things. Absolutely. I think there's both the opportunity for, again, a corny word, metaverse type of indexes. So like things like nfts or real estate on the blockchain, like actually in the metaverse real estate. And so there's all sorts of opportunities for that.
00:14:52.106 - 00:15:23.540, Speaker B: But also in the real life, in real life as well, you could have GDP. It's essentially infinite, the amount of stuff that you could do. And then also you could do, I think a really cool project is, and it has nothing to do with us. It's just something that I think is cool is like helium and all the Internet of things that's possible. And so you've got essentially all this data on the blockchain with all these Internet of things. That's a ton of new data that's available, and who knows what people can build with that.
00:15:24.310 - 00:15:41.718, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I think there's obviously a myriad of stuff that could take place with empowering data, with web three. Just curious, just to tie things up for people who are really curious about what we're talking about here. Where can people find more about trueflation?
00:15:41.814 - 00:16:04.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So you can check the app for the live inflation data today. That's app trueflation.com. And then you can find us just our main landing page, trueflation.com. We're also on Twitter at trueflation. And then if you go to our twitter, you'll see links to our telegram, which is active and our discord as well.
00:16:04.754 - 00:16:29.926, Speaker B: The telegram is more for your casual user. The discord has become more for developers to ask questions, but all are welcome. If anybody has any questions about developing, you can hit me up on Twitter. It's just at knacn is my Twitter account. But yeah, anybody that has any questions or input, we're happy to have them. Yeah.
00:16:29.948 - 00:16:42.700, Speaker A: If you don't mind, can I just give people a little bit of a teaser of the app? I got it pulled up right here if you want to tell people a little bit. Yeah, let me see if I could share real quick. Give me a second.
00:16:44.930 - 00:16:50.014, Speaker C: Yeah, this is all really interesting, what you're building. So I'm super excited to see this.
00:16:50.132 - 00:16:54.320, Speaker A: We got the dad right here. I mean, it's pretty clean.
00:16:54.690 - 00:16:55.594, Speaker B: That's right.
00:16:55.732 - 00:16:56.642, Speaker C: To look at.
00:16:56.776 - 00:17:31.114, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a sliding. We've got the highest year to date. And then also you can check just the various, like, you can have, what is it, five day, one month, six month, year to date and one year. And so you can get a feel for that. And then we also break down the categories of each of the, call them Lego pieces of the CPI. So it's food, housing, transportation, medical care, education and personal items. You can see like transportation, which is gas is the one that really had a massive impact and then.
00:17:31.114 - 00:17:43.658, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Then you can furthermore drop down to get more granularity to see. Here's transportation, here's every single part of it. And then the current rate. And all this updates every 24 hours.
00:17:43.764 - 00:18:19.338, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is super cool and informative for anyone. It doesn't matter if you're really into web three or someone who's never really even heard about blockchain before. The ability to see information like this is really empowering. To your point and the mission of you guys, what you're working on is pretty clear. Depending on your lifestyle, you could come in right here and make your choice. If you're someone who's considering higher education or going to college or whatever, you can unpack it. If you're trying to feed a family, you can unpack it.
00:18:19.338 - 00:18:21.662, Speaker A: It's a really cool application you guys have built.
00:18:21.796 - 00:18:50.200, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. The possibilities for building, let's say if you were in an industry where for food, you were just interested in food, it will be available to have called just those values, just food values. So like I said, you could call that just that single Lego piece of food, or you could break that down even more and have all those values. That's where things are moving.
00:18:50.890 - 00:19:32.382, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely, man. I'm going to stop sharing real quick here, but I think that in the spirit of web three and the composability piece, I think you referencing these components individually as Legos. It enables a whole nother derivative, myriad of options for people to continue to build and expand on even this foundation. So anyway, just felt the need to show some folks I was playing with you before we hopped on the call today. Just thought it was a really nice look, clean look, easy to. So anyway, if you guys are looking for more about trueflation, you have Ken, you have his info, you got all their info. And Ken, man, really appreciate you hopping on today.
00:19:32.516 - 00:19:33.740, Speaker B: Absolutely. Thank you so much.
