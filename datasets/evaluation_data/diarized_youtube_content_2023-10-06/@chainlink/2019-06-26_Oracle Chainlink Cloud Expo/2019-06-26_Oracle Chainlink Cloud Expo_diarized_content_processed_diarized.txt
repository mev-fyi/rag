00:00:00.450 - 00:01:01.320, Speaker A: You all right, so thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for watching. I know that there are a lot of people watching that have been waiting for this talk for some time, has been in the making for several months. So I discussion in this talk is going to be about how startups can monetize their APIs so basically they can get an additional revenue stream from their APIs by selling that data to smart contracts. My name is Fernando. I'm the senior manager for the technical team of the Oracle Startup program. Oracle has been running a startup program for about three years with great success, with hundreds of startups currently in the program and many more coming.
00:01:01.320 - 00:02:15.146, Speaker A: So the agenda here is actually pretty short, but we're going to give you an overview of APIs and blockchain just so you understand the opportunity. Why would a startup want to sell their data to the blockchain and how popular APIs have become in the recent years. Then I'm going to walk you through the architecture of a solution that I have been working on with my team and that we offer to the startups that are in the program. I'm going to give you some examples of startups that are currently in the program that could be using this new solution going forward. I'm going to make a big announcement, so there's a lot of people from one of the involved communities. So Chainlink community waiting for this. So it's going to be a pretty big announcement of a collaboration between the Oracle startup program and Chainlink, and I'm going to leave you with some of the next steps.
00:02:15.146 - 00:03:00.874, Speaker A: This is actually the beginning of a six month or maybe more run, and I'm going to talk about that later. So to talk about APIs in blockchain, I did invite a friend, Pablo, who's here, who works in the Oracle customer innovation labs in Sao Paulo. We're both from Brazil, and I have been bugging this guy for six months about this talk. So I think it's only fair that he gets to share some of the spotlight and talk to you for a few minutes about APIs in blockchain before we start talking about the architecture of these solutions. So Pablo, take it away.
00:03:00.912 - 00:04:30.358, Speaker B: Thank you, Fernando. Well, to start the talk, I will start with a question, why connecting startups API to the blockchain? And I was writing a report for Smart beer recently, this year, and some interesting facts. Three quarters of startups are already developing internal and external APIs, and the reason half of them is developing to partner with other companies both consuming API for data or selling their data, monetizing their API, some data about blockchain the World Economic Forum in Davos recently did a research and estimated that by 2027, 10% of the global GDP will be stored on blockchains. So that's nearly $8 trillion. And talking about blockchain and startups and NPIs, the same study by smart Bear identified that nearly a third of startups believe that blockchain will be the biggest growth in API adoption will be because of blockchain. But if you do a comparison about startups, APIs and blockchain, you have a tale of very two different worlds. You have startups, APIs, that complexibility, integrity, security depends on a bunch of factors that is not easily controllable.
00:04:30.358 - 00:04:58.260, Speaker B: So it is chaotic environment, contrasting blockchain environment where data is highly secure, reliable and trustworthy if he is on chain in a blockchain. But there's a lot of opportunities to unite those words. What comes with a bunch of challenges also. And now I'll let Fernando walk you through of some of those challenges and recommend a possible solution. Thank you.
00:04:59.350 - 00:05:59.602, Speaker A: Yeah, so, as Pablo was saying, there is a technical challenge that many of you watching may be aware of, which is that it's just not a good idea. To put it simply, it's just not a good idea for a smart contract to go to an external API without a middleware in the middle. There's a lot of things for the meter to do, like in traditional midwear, there's a lot of things that a midweek can do to reduce the burden on the application. It's the same as many platforms that we had before, and it's the same with smart contracts. And there's the mem. There's always a mem in a blockchain talk, which is the concern is bringing bad data to a smart contract is just not a good idea. So as Pablo was saying, the blockchain is highly secure, it's reliable and trustworthy.
00:05:59.602 - 00:07:10.190, Speaker A: You've heard it many times before, but the external data isn't, right. So if your smart contract takes input from somebody else, from some other source, and that data, and that bad data gets in your smart contract, it doesn't really matter how secure or reliable or trustworthy the blockchain is. That blockchain is now ruined, right? It's now dealing with bad data, which is definitely not a good idea. So in order to fix that, a number of vendors have introduced adweight, as I mentioned before, and I'm working specially with one, which I'm going to talk to you about called Changlink. So the solution that we have developed and that we are now offering to the startups in the Oracle startup program starts with the Oracle cloud infrastructure. So for those of you that don't use the Oracle cloud, Oracle cloud infrastructure is the infrastructure services provided by Oracle which are similar to other clouds. So we're talking here about basic compute, network and storage.
00:07:10.190 - 00:08:02.270, Speaker A: Oracle also offers a managed blockchain service, and this is for enterprises. Oracle, as you know, is primarily targeted in enterprises. So this is a managed service for enterprises based on Hyperledger fabric that has been very successful. So I can't really share the numbers, but this thing has been selling very well. So enterprises are signing up for this service to start their blockchain projects, right. And again, based on Hyperledger. So inside that platform, what you get, simply put, is a number of nodes that have at least two things, right? So they have a copy of the ledger, right? You've heard about it before, a copy of the ledger, aka a copy of the data.
00:08:02.270 - 00:09:20.614, Speaker A: And they have what Hyperledger calls chain codes, which are the smart contracts that I was referring to before. So in hyperledger they're called chain codes. So to a minimum, that's what you would expect in each node in your blockchain running in the Oracle blockchain platform. On top of that, in this solution, I add a theorem client, because in order to get the chain link, which again is going to be the midway between the oracle blockchain platform and the startups APIs, I need to go to Ethereum. So this is an example, which is not as common as you would think of one blockchain going to another blockchain. So this is a private blockchain, what you call it, permissioned blockchain, going to a public blockchain, a non permissioned blockchain on its way to a startup's API, you would anyway go to the external world, right? But in this case, you're going to first go to Ethereum and then to the startups API. So using that Ethereum client chain codes reach Ethereum, and in Ethereum you also have a few components that are important to understand.
00:09:20.614 - 00:09:50.660, Speaker A: First is you got a copy of the ledger. This is not the same ledger, obviously, as in the blockchain platform. So the Oracle blockchain platform, that's the enterprise using it, right? That's the enterprise data. In Ethereum, there is also a ledger, but it has nothing to do with the enterprise ledger. And there you have two new components that you may not have heard before. One of them is called Chainlink. So the company and the software have the same name.
00:09:50.660 - 00:11:15.042, Speaker A: What that chain link does, it's going to service what in blockchains call it Oracle. So it's going to be a piece of software which is also a contract, a piece of software in between the chain codes in the Oracle blockchain platform, Ada API. So that's a piece of code that you need to write. That piece of code uses another piece of code called external adapter, which is the code that actually makes the call to the external API. So what we're building here is a solution to get to the startups APIs, which starts with chain codes which may be written actually in a variety of languages, and running the Oracle blockchain platform, this is something that the enterprise writes, right? So this is the Oracle customers writing it. Oracle 430,000 customers in 175 countries. So those are the Oracle customers writing those chain codes and going through Ethereum and chain link to get to a startup's API and have the same high security reliability and trustworthiness that they would get if they were only dealing with data that is already in the blockchain with data that is on chain.
00:11:15.126 - 00:11:15.806, Speaker C: Right?
00:11:15.988 - 00:13:37.100, Speaker A: So it is a lot of software to write, right? And I'm going to go back to this later. If you are an enterprise and you want to consume like, let's say enterprise are never small, right? It's never about consuming one API, right? That's not going to happen, right? So I've been in the enterprise software business for 20 years and I've already found myself working for companies that had like 600 systems just around the one that I was responsible for, right? So enterprise is always big, right? So if an enterprise wanted to consume, let's say ten APIs in their chain codes, they would need to build by themselves these chain links and these external adapters for each one of those APIs, right? So that's a lot of work for the enterprise, right? That's also a lot of work for the startup. So if the startup decided in advance to having a deal, write to those chain links and write to those external adapters and make those available to the enterprise, that would still be a lot of code. But when you're talking startups, there's another problem, which is they have few resources, right? They don't have the same money as the enterprise, so they may not really have the capacity, so to say, to write all of this code in advance and let it sit there until an enterprise actually wants it. So we have a problem, right? So the enterprises using enterprise blockchain in a product like the Oracle blockchain platform, they do want to consume external APIs with all these guarantees that Chainlink and decentralized admitter like it offer. But it's a lot of software for them to write by themselves. And startups, even though they kind of have an incentive, they're probably going to have trouble or they're going to face challenges writing all of this software in advance to having an actual deal.
00:13:37.100 - 00:14:38.320, Speaker A: So it's a classic startup's problem, and I think a company like Oracle in our startup program can greatly help to fix that. And I'm going to tell you how. But before I get there, I want to give you some examples of startups that are currently in the program that are already working with me and my team to implement this solution. Right? So companies that are either already working or considering working with us for this solution, the first one is a company from Brazil called Smart Trips, right? We have companies everywhere, right? So the Orco startup program is truly global. So we have startups from pretty much everywhere, just like Oracle has offices everywhere, we have startups from everywhere. And Smarttrips is from Brazil. What Smarttrips does is pretty interesting.
00:14:38.320 - 00:15:13.562, Speaker A: So if you're a business traveler and you pick a cheaper alternative for a flight or a hotel, they take the most expensive flight that you could possibly pick. They pick the difference between that price and the price of the alternative that you picked and they give you that money as credit, as points, right? So they have the ability to answer that question, which is, was this flight a cheaper alternative for my employee at booking time. So they have the capability, they have an API that can give that information.
00:15:13.696 - 00:15:14.282, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:14.416 - 00:15:16.378, Speaker A: They are not a blockchain company.
00:15:16.544 - 00:15:17.018, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:17.104 - 00:15:42.990, Speaker A: So we're not talking here about connecting blockchain companies to yet another blockchain company, right. That's actually pretty common. What we are aiming for is a solution to connect known blockchain startups, startups that are not necessarily using blockchain today to the blockchain revolution to make them available in blockchain and to help them to monetize what they have. So this is an API that Smarttrips could potentially monetize.
00:15:43.070 - 00:15:43.458, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:43.544 - 00:16:08.546, Speaker A: So it's very possible, it's very likely that there are companies outside of Smarttrips itself that would want to consume that information, right? And that's the kind of information that you can think of a smart contract that could use that. And by the way, this potential consumers of an API like that even include people already working with smart trips.
00:16:08.578 - 00:16:08.738, Speaker C: Right?
00:16:08.764 - 00:16:48.626, Speaker A: So perhaps the smart trips itself is not using blockchain, but a company working with them is using blockchain and like to consume that event, to consume that information from Smartrips through an API. So this is the first example. The second example comes from Asia, from India. It's a company called Incraft. What incraft does is also very, very interesting. They monitor inventory of a certain brand. They work for brands, so they monitor the inventory and they can tell you when that inventory needs to be rebalanced across retailers.
00:16:48.626 - 00:17:07.600, Speaker A: So let's say you have two retailers. One of them, for some reason, starts to sell exceptionally well. So something happens and this one retailer starts to sell exceptionally well beyond what was planned. These guys can tell you when that happened.
00:17:08.130 - 00:17:08.880, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:09.890 - 00:18:03.322, Speaker A: Again, that's the kind of information that they could sell, right? So in addition, to have that information consumed by their own systems, they could sell that information to other parties, a third party, they could share that with a mean, it's again, not very difficult to think of somebody around their ecosystem, around that company that could use that data. Again, incraft, like smart trips, is not a blockchain company, right? They don't even use blockchain, but they have an API that can give you that answer, and I'm sure they would like to monetize it. It doesn't take you much time work with startups or with anyone to learn that people like to make more money to get new revenue streams and APIs. Are this an explored revenue stream for most startups?
00:18:03.386 - 00:18:04.000, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:05.410 - 00:18:27.682, Speaker A: I should actually take the time to say that there are actually startups that sell their APIs, right? Actually, it's not as usual as you would think, but startups do sell their APIs, but they do that with like a separate product, a separate subscription service other than through the blockchain.
00:18:27.746 - 00:18:28.454, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:28.652 - 00:19:37.674, Speaker A: And even though it's not really the topic of my conversation here, you could argue that selling data in a blockchain is considerably easier than selling it with your own subscription service, because there's a lot of things that you do for a subscription service that you don't need to do in the blockchain, including crypto payments, right. If you're getting all your payments in crypto, that makes your life much, much easier than taking fiat money and dealing with the crazy, completely nuts global payment system. So the third example comes from Europe, from the UK. It's a company called iglize. And iglize is in the travel time search business. So what they can do is they can tell you how long it's going to take for you to get somewhere and how long, for example, it's going to take you to take a package to a customer, right? So they have an API that can tell you that, idealized by the way, already sells API. They have an API product.
00:19:37.674 - 00:20:42.082, Speaker A: They sell access to the API, not to smart contracts, not in the blockchain, but they do have an API and that's the question that they can answer. How long is it going to take for you to deliver a package to a customer? So there you go. I have three startups that are already in the Oracle startup program, which is called Oracle for startups. They are all over the place. One of them is in the Americas, the other is in Asia, the other is in Europe. All these three guys could be selling their data in the blockchain, but they're not, right? And again, I think that a company like Oracle and a startup program like ours should be able to help these companies to create that additional revenue stream and why not? And also create this ecosystem around them, right. What I usually say is that oracles and all the other big vendors, their biggest asset is the ecosystem that they created around them, right? So there are millions of people certified in Oracle technology.
00:20:42.082 - 00:22:18.634, Speaker A: There are hundreds of thousands of partners and thousands of ISVs working with Oracle. That took us a few decades to create. And that's something that a startup can, it's very hard for a startup to create by itself. So again, I think in addition to just giving them technological help, right, to give them the support that they need to connect the APIs to blockchain, Oracle's contribution can really be helping these companies to create this ecosystem around them, right? So to find these partners, to communicate with these partners and to make their business more successful. So I have an announcement, and I'm sure Twitter is going to like this now. Right now. So the announcement that I'm making here is that to support startups that want to sell their API in the blockchain, other than just talking about it, other than just giving you a diagram for it or to give you a link with the code for you to do that, other than just doing that, we are actually going to develop, we are going to pick 50 startups and we are going to do it with them, right? So we are going to pick 50 qualified startups and develop chain links for them.
00:22:18.634 - 00:22:36.710, Speaker A: Again, chain links the software between the Oracle blockchain platform and these startups APIs. We're going to pick 50 startups and we are going to develop chain links for each one of them and to prepare them to sell to our customers, which are many.
00:22:36.780 - 00:22:37.400, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:38.490 - 00:22:44.426, Speaker A: So we are actually going to do it with them rather than just tell them how to do it.
00:22:44.528 - 00:22:45.180, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:46.270 - 00:22:55.082, Speaker A: And by doing that, again, I think we do more than just give technology support, we actually help those companies grow.
00:22:55.136 - 00:22:55.354, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:55.392 - 00:23:53.514, Speaker A: As I said, startups very more often than not they want to do things, but they don't have the resources or they don't have the time. So we're going to fix that. So the team that I manage is going to give architect to the effort. We're going to form a squad with one Arctet from Oracle, one specialist from Oracle, and one or maybe two resources from the startup. We're going to get together and we are going to develop, co develop this chain links with this 50 companies from all over the world and we are going to announce this 50 companies in the Oracle Cold one conference in San Francisco in September. The Oracle startup program is open to all startups, right. So any startup that is watching me right now or can join the program, there's no selection.
00:23:53.642 - 00:23:54.270, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:54.420 - 00:23:55.962, Speaker A: So any startup can join.
00:23:56.026 - 00:23:56.302, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:56.356 - 00:24:02.434, Speaker A: Any startup from any country in any industry, it doesn't matter if it's B, two C or B, two B, it doesn't matter.
00:24:02.552 - 00:24:03.170, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:03.320 - 00:24:07.598, Speaker A: You can join the program to participate in this initiative.
00:24:07.694 - 00:24:08.194, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:08.312 - 00:24:34.378, Speaker A: And on top of getting the chance to work with my team to develop these chain links, you're going to get by joining the program, free cloud credits, a 70% discount. So when your credits run out and you still have a 70% discount, which is just huge.
00:24:34.464 - 00:24:34.858, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:34.944 - 00:24:39.118, Speaker A: And makes us cheaper than anyone else.
00:24:39.204 - 00:24:39.840, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:40.610 - 00:25:13.222, Speaker A: So we give you free cloud credits, we give you a 70% discount, we give you unlimited access. Two oracles 24 x seven by 365 technical support with additional Q and A and escalation support from my team. So again, we go beyond other programs because we just don't give you credits. We just don't give you a discount. We give you unlimited access to support and additional support on top of that with our own team for Q A and escalation.
00:25:13.286 - 00:25:13.850, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:14.000 - 00:25:27.166, Speaker A: And that's among other benefits. So you can go to the program website right now, ww dot oracle.com startup and join the program. This is an equity free program.
00:25:27.348 - 00:25:27.886, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:27.988 - 00:25:35.070, Speaker A: We're not in the business of buying companies through the program. That's not what we're doing.
00:25:35.140 - 00:25:35.662, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:35.796 - 00:26:18.334, Speaker A: So it's an equity free program that offers you all those benefits and it's also going to offer you a special opportunity to work with my team, to work with me and to work with my team in the development of chain links that are going to help you to monetize your APIs in the blockchain. So again, other than just telling you how giving you diagrams or code, I'm actually going to do it for you. But I need startups, right? So if you're watching this and you want to explore the idea with me and with my team to sell your data to a blockchain, join the program now and then we will talk.
00:26:18.452 - 00:26:18.926, Speaker C: Right?
00:26:19.028 - 00:27:09.920, Speaker A: Join the program and then we will talk. We will discuss the opportunity we are trying to find. Maybe we can even find customers for your API in the program itself. Again, hundreds of startups, right? Or I have this other 430,000 customers of mine that I'm sure you may be interested to reach and they may be interested in consuming your data on the Oracle blockchain platform. So again, very special opportunity, a very important announcement, and we are going to announce the winners in the Oracle code one conference in September. It's between September 16 and 19. I don't have the date yet, but the sessions confirmed it's going to be in September, Oracle code one.
00:27:09.920 - 00:27:30.286, Speaker A: So before I go, let me leave you with some of the next steps here. So the first step is any startup that is interested in monetizing their APIs in the blockchain can join the Oracle for startups program now, right? Free site is up. Go ahead and join the program.
00:27:30.408 - 00:27:31.080, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:31.530 - 00:28:38.390, Speaker A: And then we're going to talk. The next step is, which is already in progress, my team is going to publish new content about how to run Chainlink and Ethereum on OCI on Oracle cloud infrastructure. And this is also for the startups, but this is also for other entrepreneurs or other members of the link community, my fellow marines, which may be interested to learn how to run Chainlink and also Ethereum on OCI. So we're going to publish that content in the next few weeks or months in between now and September. So we're going to publish that content in the official program blog, the official Oracle for Startups blog. Then we're going to also publish content about how to develop these chain codes. So how to actually write code that runs in the Oracle blockchain platform and goes through Ethereum and Chainlink to a startup API.
00:28:38.390 - 00:28:43.194, Speaker A: So we are actually going to publish content for you to learn how to do it.
00:28:43.232 - 00:28:43.578, Speaker C: Right?
00:28:43.664 - 00:28:55.278, Speaker A: So for those startups that are not selected to work with us, those startups are going to get instructions to do it by themselves.
00:28:55.364 - 00:28:55.566, Speaker C: Right?
00:28:55.588 - 00:29:37.546, Speaker A: So we're going to publish content about how an enterprise can develop the whole thing by itself if they choose to do so, or how a startup can write the chain link and deploy it on OCI and connect it to Oracle blockchain platform. So that's another piece of content that we're going to publish in between now and September. Then in September we have the Oracle code one talk. So I fly again from Brazil to the US for a conference. It's going to be the Oracle code one conference here in San Francisco. And after that we start developing the chain links.
00:29:37.578 - 00:29:37.774, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:37.812 - 00:29:51.026, Speaker A: So after I have selected the startups, we're going to form the squads with the 50 of them using the resources of my team and we are going to start developing these things and announcing them.
00:29:51.128 - 00:29:51.682, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:51.816 - 00:30:35.246, Speaker A: So it is certainly going to take some time for us to develop it's 50 pieces of code. Right. So it's going to take us some time. And this is the kind of thing that you also want to space a little bit just to give every startup a little bit of the spotlight. So we are talking about making announcements of new chain links for maybe a year, right? So this is not only Oracle, the ORC for startups telling you that we are going to develop 50 chain links in collaboration with the chain link company. This is Oracle for startups telling you that we are going to do it for a year.
00:30:35.348 - 00:30:35.710, Speaker C: Right?
00:30:35.780 - 00:30:47.762, Speaker A: We're going to do it 50 times over a year and we are going to publish this code and run these announcements all over a year.
00:30:47.816 - 00:30:48.274, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:48.392 - 00:30:51.830, Speaker A: I'm thinking it may take about a year to complete the 50.
00:30:51.900 - 00:30:52.182, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:52.236 - 00:31:11.386, Speaker A: And nothing really stops us from picking other 50 companies after this. Again, Oracle has resources to support startups, has a lot of resources to support the startups and has all the interest in the world to connect them to the Oracle blockchain platform and to offer that connectivity to our customers.
00:31:11.568 - 00:31:11.962, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:12.016 - 00:31:17.438, Speaker A: So we have all the interest in the world to do it. So we're going to do it with 50 now let's see how it goes.
00:31:17.524 - 00:31:18.160, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:20.690 - 00:31:22.158, Speaker A: And we'll take it from there.

00:31:22.852 - 00:31:37.630, Speaker A: So again, before I go, the important thing is if you work in a startup or if you own a startup that could potentially sell data API data to smart contracts in a blockchain.
00:31:37.710 - 00:31:38.340, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:38.790 - 00:32:27.200, Speaker A: If you're not thinking, yeah, that sounds like something that I could do, right. Or you know, somebody that works in a startup that could use that, please invite them to join the program. So to go to oracle.com startup to read about the program, there's also obviously a channel for you to get in touch with us for additional questions before you sign up, take a look, sign up, join the program and I'm going to be more than glad to work with you and your team to explore this business opportunity and maybe select you to be one of the 50 companies that are going to work with us to co develop this code and this content.
