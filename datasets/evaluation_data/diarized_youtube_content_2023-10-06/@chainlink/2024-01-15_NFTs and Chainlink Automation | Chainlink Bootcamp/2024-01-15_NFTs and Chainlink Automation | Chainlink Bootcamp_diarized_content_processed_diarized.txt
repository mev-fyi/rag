00:00:09.870 - 00:01:05.650, Speaker A: Sorry, this is the english session so welcome everyone. We are here to our section number six. I'm so excited today. And I used to say that to be a developer advocate is to live in a dangerous way. And why? Because you are doing things live and sometimes things didn't work or live or like some minutes before like today. So this will be really amazing to do this class today in English especially because I create a new project live with you because 2 hours before my old project that I use is since two years ago and it's really that project is not working and so it's time to create a new project. First of all, let's create our pet.
00:01:05.650 - 00:01:37.760, Speaker A: Probably someone already did it for me. Yes. I don't know. Let's go to our content. I'm equating the pad. Wait 1 minute and then I will share with you session six. I hope that you have some time in the weekend to review the content to be sure that you are read now.
00:01:37.760 - 00:02:06.210, Speaker A: And one more minute. I almost read with you. Yes. So here we are. Let's check this film. Yes, he was here waiting to me to put the right phrase. I love you guys.
00:02:06.210 - 00:02:40.260, Speaker A: It's so amazing. This, I need to tell you have no idea how I am happy with this boot camp. It's really amazing. I feel that I may really make a difference in your life and make more people. Bring more people to the blockchain world to word that we can trust more on cryptograph and to a better word. This is the point and welcome. I'm so glad to see everyone here now.
00:02:40.260 - 00:03:25.918, Speaker A: And you are here and I will update our slay. Wait a minute. Some minutes to you to come here and I am in the other screen just now. Let's update this to you're. Yes. Amazing to have everyone here. Two more minutes and then I started the content.
00:03:25.918 - 00:03:57.220, Speaker A: Okay, how we are? Let's go to the chat. Thank you. I think you are ready. Okay. I'd like to add more slides for you. Change automation. Okay.
00:03:57.220 - 00:04:50.970, Speaker A: It's amazing. Like I have all these lights done to one point and now you do another. Let's see. So here we are. Let's go today's lights, by the way, before go to these lights, let's add something important to you. Like remember that we have the task form to you to add your tasks to receive the certificate later. And the best place to you to get contact, it's in our develop portal.
00:04:50.970 - 00:05:15.106, Speaker A: And also our sessions are here in the luma where you did your inscription. The discord channel. You can ask questions over there. No, we don't have it here. I think not. Let's see. No.
00:05:15.106 - 00:05:40.700, Speaker A: So someone put something different in my slide. Okay, maybe you put the slide that we are today. No, this is the right. Okay. You must open this. Okay, I got it. Yes, it was here.
00:05:40.700 - 00:06:09.120, Speaker A: I can't open now. I must signing. But it's this. Yeah, we're done. Let's put you in a better place. Oh, you are welcome. And I'm so glad that you are learning.
00:06:09.120 - 00:06:55.092, Speaker A: Oh, I forgot to put the pad here. Wait, this is the pad? Yes, you can fill the formula on the last day. In fact, after the last day, I will give you some more days, probably until the end of this month. If you fill the pad, you receive the certificate from this boot camp. Exactly. No new task until now. Wait a minute.
00:06:55.092 - 00:07:17.460, Speaker A: That I added the task at the end of the class. Okay. And like I said before, I must create some smart content live today because the other is not working. And I got a new idea. So let's do something new. Here we are. No, here we are.
00:07:17.460 - 00:07:42.122, Speaker A: The content today is this. We are talking about nfts dynamic NFTs and chain link automation. And the pad is not good now. Yes, here. And we are hearing the welcome, welcome everyone. And the developer part of that. You already have it.
00:07:42.122 - 00:08:59.250, Speaker A: And nfts. Let's go. First of all, what's NFT? The idea is that NFTs representing something can be like a punk, a ticket, a real estate, an apartment, some posts, some badges, some trading cards, wherever we really talk about to represent digital assets. But you can represent some real world assets and you don't have limits to what you'd like to have in your presentation in blockchain using an NFT. I like to say that even and to understand better NFTs, it's interesting to understand the concept of fungible and unfungible selfie. Imagine that a $100 Bill, this is a fungible token. Why? If you change one bill for another bill, both bills of $100, they worth the same.
00:08:59.250 - 00:09:26.970, Speaker A: It's the same value. But when we talk about NFTs, we are talking about to have something unfungible. It means that this is unique. And even if you have two copies each of this copy, you have a different idea, a different identification. So you be unique. This is the idea. NFts are unique.
00:09:26.970 - 00:10:26.574, Speaker A: And most part of the NFTs today, they still are static. But the idea is that in the future the NFT will be dynamic. Like here I have the Lamello bow. This is a basketball player. And he has some NFTs that is predating according with his points and talking about more about NFTs because when I'm saying that an NFT is unique, the people think, oh, but if it's unique, how can change, how can be dynamic? Imagine that you are an NFT. I am an nFt, so I am unique. I have my unique fingerprint, my unique DNA, but I'm changing day by day.
00:10:26.574 - 00:11:50.074, Speaker A: I'm being older, I hope to not be fat, but my body is changing as well. Everything is changing. I am an NFG for sure, and you are the same, you are unique, but we are changing. This can be the concept of a dynamic NFT and also we can think about rules and conditions to update nfts, like scores, like career riot experiences, weather like I have here the chain link different conditions. So when we talk about NFTs, not necessarily an NFT must have an image, but if you'd like to list it in some marketplace, it's good to have it and it's normal to have NFTs with images. And where can you store these images can be like on chain. I will not do this example today, but I have another project that probably we are doing until the end of the boot camp where yes, we are doing this.
00:11:50.074 - 00:13:24.530, Speaker A: I store the image on chain and I change the image on chain because it will be like an SVG image. But also I can store images off chain like you pass the URL of the image inside my NFT, you store this. When we store the image off chain you can think about to store in some centralized system or centralized cloud you can, but we are living in a decentralized world, so it is better if you store your image in decentralized way. And this is IPFS. IPFs is an alternative to do this. It's the interplanetary file system and you can run a node of IPFs to store, but you can also use some services that make our life easy to upload the files to the IPFs and to ping the files over there. Because if your file is in IPFs but is not broadcast to other nodes, it can also disappear even if it's centralized.
00:13:24.530 - 00:14:18.842, Speaker A: But when you ping using some services like this, this services guarantee that they always have an instance and copy of your file. And in this way it will be broadcasted to the other nodes and be decentralized. And I put some alternatives here, you can check some of this. Today I'm using pinata, but all of them are good. Choose what is better for you. Now let's talk about the structure of an NFT. When you have an NFT used to have some kind of metadata, and this can be where you save the information store.
00:14:18.842 - 00:14:55.478, Speaker A: The information store. The attributes related to the NFT I got from the openC. It is a marketplace that we are using today, later. And the image is not so big, but it's to understand how this works, like in the metadata. This is a json file. It's a special kind of file to organize information. And this is the NFT, the smart content.
00:14:55.478 - 00:15:50.390, Speaker A: And this is a kind of NFT, the erc seven to one content. So inside of the content, we have the metadata to each of the NFTs that you are minting on this collection. And if the information you appear over there, like in the marketplace, the image, the properties that you appear here, and if you create an NFT that didn't follow Jesus standard, you can do it. But probably you cannot list on Opensea or other marketplaces that use the same standard. And yes, Roma, you are right. That metadata looks really like an object. And I'm creating one live now because the other is not working.
00:15:50.390 - 00:16:38.386, Speaker A: So let's create live in a few minutes. And this is like you told before, JSOn. It's a kind of file like you have the Sol, the solidity extension for solidity files. You can have the json file. It's the extension to have a json file. And this is a structure of the file like we must have in order to list on open Zeppelin, you must have this structure, the name, the description, some image and some attributes. And talking about how to store this metadata.
00:16:38.386 - 00:17:19.314, Speaker A: Like the images, you can store this on chain inside this much content. You can create this life. Not today, because today is the most simple and beginner NfT that we are creating. But in other day during the boot camp, we were doing another creating this on chain, but also we can store the metadata off chain with URL, a link like you are doing with the image. And we are doing this now. And thank you, Chris, for this explanation. This is great.
00:17:19.314 - 00:17:51.630, Speaker A: If you can copy this in the pad. I love it. Okay. And this is the basic points that we use items that we used to have in the metadata. So before that, let's organize a bit more here. So I may put a divider here. Nfts, nfts metadata.
00:17:51.630 - 00:18:12.660, Speaker A: JSON. Thank you. Let's come back. So creating an NFT. We used to say that we are creating an NFT, but in fact we are creating an NFT collection. Okay. And let's do this better.
00:18:12.660 - 00:19:11.098, Speaker A: It means that we are creating smart content and this much content will be the collection inside that we can mint NFTs, a lot of NFTs, in fact. Okay, Ashko. Yes. QNFts can have the same image and if you'd like to not reuse it, you must check this in your collection. It depends of the purpose of your collection and how you are creating your project related to this. So this is how we are creating the smart content. Like we create an ERC 20 token using open zeppelin.
00:19:11.098 - 00:20:12.580, Speaker A: We can create NfT collection using the open zeppelin as well. Let's go over there. Cr, I think you have some problems with prox or something is blocked in your network. Okay, I'm putting all the contracts on my GitHub for now. After I finish the contract, I will upload on the GitHub and then you can get over there. Okay, we have problems in other sessions of the bootcamp with the same, in other languages, like they are in environments that they cannot access the pad because the pad is blocked. So here, this is a basic that you can see that this is my NFT, the name that you have.
00:20:12.580 - 00:21:00.174, Speaker A: And to be mintable, we have, like I said before, each NFT to be unique, they must have a unique ID and you can manage how you are incrementing the IDs. And also you can have roles and et cetera, stuff like that. This is one way to you to create. I will create another in a few minutes. And like I said before, I'm creating live because I'm changing my idea and my NFT today. So in a few minutes we come back here to create. Okay, let's see what's more marketplace.
00:21:00.174 - 00:21:49.778, Speaker A: After we create our NFT collection, we can list in a marketplace, the marketplace is used to monitor NFTs that appear on chain and automatically add them, index them. It's like they have a centralized database and they can manage this and list this to us. This is terrible. Wait, one of the most know it is the OpenC Opensea. It's a huge marketplace and this is the way that we are listing this later. Okay, I can share with you. Not this, not this.
00:21:49.778 - 00:22:28.670, Speaker A: I think this is my problem now. Yes, I will share with you my problem. I create an NFT a few minutes ago, like 2 hours ago, that's supposed to be a flower that is growing, but the image is not appearing. And if I go here, I have the JSon on IPFs of the JSon file. This JSON is the image and this is not working. I can only upload this again on my account. This is one alternative.
00:22:28.670 - 00:23:14.910, Speaker A: But when I created the smart content I had decoding the images. So what I'm doing now, I'm creating a new ismatch content live with you. So you must wait some minutes watching me creating this. And then when my smart content is done, I will share with you. So you cannot copy and paste just now because I create now. But going back in order to create my smart content, I must have the images. So let's do this and I will share with you my original idea and what I'm doing now.
00:23:14.910 - 00:23:51.510, Speaker A: Oh, I did something wrong that everything have terrible colors. The copy and paste didn't work today. So my idea was creating this dynamic NFt. He shut was with you Friday, last Friday. And this flower that is growing was his project, his idea. So he created this dynamic NFT, this flower with three stages that was from seed to the flower. And it's supposed to me to do this with you because the images is not appearing.
00:23:51.510 - 00:24:27.960, Speaker A: I'm creating a new one that will be a photo album that the image is changing. But we can have the same image in different NFTs. Like we said before, I'm looking here if I have another to you. Yeah, I have one of these that was working one year, not one year, but some time ago. And I'd like to share with you this. Wait. Flower here.
00:24:27.960 - 00:25:17.506, Speaker A: This is one flower collection that I did in September of 2023. You can see that I have some seeds, some that is growing, another that's not in the middle. This is an example. Goodbye. But now we are doing a new project that will be the photo album. I was getting some food before start here and this session when they decided, okay, let's do a photo album. I select some photos.
00:25:17.506 - 00:25:49.874, Speaker A: Now I'm uploading these photos to pinata. I will create a new JSOn file using pinata and like using visual code and then upload to pinata. And then I'm sharing this with you. So it will be like 15 minutes that I'm coding. And if you'd like to do this part with me, you can, but it's not the most important. Okay. You can try this later because you must create an account.
00:25:49.874 - 00:26:25.088, Speaker A: You need more time to do this on pinata. And this is some Audi files that I have. So let's go here. What I'm doing, I'm creating my NFT now. Wait, let's select the images. Open my computer. I select some.
00:26:25.088 - 00:27:26.820, Speaker A: I will do a tiger collection with you because I love tigers. But I'd like to have the tiger two, I know that you are not seeing, but wait. That you are seeing in a few minutes. Okay. And tiger three. Okay, I have more images, but this is something. Images that I have here now.
00:27:26.820 - 00:28:02.168, Speaker A: And I will upload these three. Tiger one, two and three. Not the others. Okay. So I delete this and create a new album on pinata. So upload if you have some image that you'd like to do your now you can do it, but you must create the account here. I will not wait this part because my goal is to share these images with you.
00:28:02.168 - 00:28:37.492, Speaker A: You can use my images since I finish. Okay, this is my photo album upload. And I like to Tiger photo album. So I'm doing the upload of some imagings now. And this is. These are the images, the three images that we have. Okay, let's do this big.
00:28:37.492 - 00:29:03.550, Speaker A: And you can see that each of this image has a hash. And if I change something on the image, I'll change the image. You change the hash as well. This is the folder. And inside of this folder we have these images. Okay, let's see one. This is one of that.
00:29:03.550 - 00:29:45.052, Speaker A: So next I must create the json file related to this. And I can create this in any place, including the pet. But I'm creating in another place because you don't need to create this now. You can only see this part and you are doing with me when I finish the content. Okay, this is the tiger one. And I must get the image of my tiger and add here. So let's do it.
00:29:45.052 - 00:30:08.816, Speaker A: This is the first tiger. I need to get this and add here. So you can see that I'm adding the URL of this image. This is a bengal tiger. And this picture was taken in Tempa Bush Gardens. Tempa. Okay, this is it.
00:30:08.816 - 00:30:41.118, Speaker A: Okay, let's do the second photo. It will be another tiger. Let's see, what is this? Tiger two. And I know that I'm not waiting for you now. Okay, I remember that it was in Tokyo. Let's change this to I get two. And this was in Tokyo.
00:30:41.118 - 00:31:06.490, Speaker A: In the wendo or something like that. Zoe in Tokyo. Let's change the image tree. I have some template over there. Did you saw? And the image tree is this. Okay, this is another from Tempa. From Boshi Gardens on Tempa.
00:31:06.490 - 00:31:31.940, Speaker A: Let's do it here. Tiger three. Tiger three. Tempa al Bengal tigers. Is this. So now I'm uploading this to Pinata. Let's create another.
00:31:31.940 - 00:31:57.340, Speaker A: I'm creating another folder. I know that you are not seeing now. Yes, you are seeing. Okay, let's do this new folder. And this will be json photo album. JSon that we need this. Okay, let's do this now.
00:31:57.340 - 00:32:19.870, Speaker A: And here I must add probably this is so small for you. Can I do this right? Yeah. I cannot increase this. Sorry that it's a bit small. But I'm adding here the content only of that three images. These three images. Let's add it here.
00:32:19.870 - 00:32:37.298, Speaker A: Don't worry. To do this with me now. Okay. You will follow me in a few minutes. I know that I'm not sharing this with you just now. So let's go over that pinata again. And now I'd like to upload another folder.
00:32:37.298 - 00:33:10.740, Speaker A: And this folder will be the photo album JsON. And it will be the Tiger photo album JSOn. Here I could add here is there. Let's open this. And now I'm going to our smart context where I'm using this. I'm creating this first for me, then for you. Okay.
00:33:10.740 - 00:33:33.914, Speaker A: I must have another cop of my remix because I have it using another place. And I know that you are not seeing. Don't worry about it. It's not a flower anymore. You'll be the photo album. Okay. In a few minutes, I will share the code to you to do with me.
00:33:33.914 - 00:34:01.060, Speaker A: Okay. This will be the photo album. And I'm exchanging the flowers. So let's understand what I'm doing here and fix this life. What I have here is the photo album. I must add here the three URLs that I have here. Let's get one.
00:34:01.060 - 00:34:20.680, Speaker A: So this will be the first. You can see that. Wow. The pinata. It's a bit late. Let's see what's happened here. By the way, maybe this can fix the order.
00:34:20.680 - 00:34:39.760, Speaker A: Okay, let's use this. Not exactly the pinata. And because maybe this. I think this will not be good. No, I don't like this. Wait. Because if you are using this, probably you cannot access later.
00:34:39.760 - 00:35:13.142, Speaker A: Let's change this as well. I'd like to access this image in a different way. And this. Okay. Let's access this directly on IPFs. So I must change it. That creates thing to be only this it.
00:35:13.142 - 00:35:34.600, Speaker A: Okay, it's the same. But now I'm sure that I am on the right link. So I will predate here again. I lost. Wait a minute. Tiger tree. Okay, now this is good.
00:35:34.600 - 00:36:12.280, Speaker A: It. And then for three, do the same for the others and change it better now. And really I'm doing this live now. I could not fix my problem before. So you are seeing all the process that I'm doing to create this. This can be good for you. And because I copied this from here, I'm doing here.
00:36:12.280 - 00:36:51.600, Speaker A: Let's update this hit place and come back here now. Not here, here. Like I deleted this. It means when I doing the ping. Ping is the process to be sure that your file will be on IPFs started by Pingata until you disappear it. So did. And I upload again the new one below.
00:36:51.600 - 00:37:15.078, Speaker A: And this time I added the tiger on this way. Let's see if you need something. No, I think I would. Okay, we are here. So this is again. And remember that I must use this. You can see that change.
00:37:15.078 - 00:37:51.650, Speaker A: This is different. Let's see the target. The image is not different. What is different? Is this the JSon here? Let's go here again on remix to understand the difference. So if I remove this part, you can see that the name of my album, my hash, my PFs hash before was this. And now is this. This is the new one.
00:37:51.650 - 00:38:22.570, Speaker A: So we must use this. And let's do this with the three. Now I'm good. Two and three. Okay, this is good. I'd like to be sure. So I will get you one of these and try it.
00:38:22.570 - 00:38:44.268, Speaker A: How good? Let's get one of these and try it. How good as well. Let's see the order. Like the two here. I'd like to test everything. No, this is bad. I must fix this.
00:38:44.268 - 00:39:08.268, Speaker A: Let's understand the why. Let's see the tree. I didn't save it. Probably. Yeah, let's see the tree. No, not here. 43 and this is goodbye.
00:39:08.268 - 00:39:32.730, Speaker A: And this seems to be the same. Yes, this hash must be the same. Because this is the folder. Let's get here to be sure if it is right. Tiger photo album. While you check this again. Tiger photo album.
00:39:32.730 - 00:39:53.906, Speaker A: Let's open it. Maybe Philippe, you are right. Probably I have a problem with this as well. My magic. It's upstairs. It's up. Case down.
00:39:53.906 - 00:40:23.244, Speaker A: Yes, you are right. Great. Thank you. I love my students. So I must fix the second. Okay, let's fix the second. What's the best? And you think that I'm doing a mess like because I have extensions in lowercase and uppercase.
00:40:23.244 - 00:40:53.644, Speaker A: I could put in our equal. But especially because I'm doing this live. You can see how the process in this way. Crazy process. And because I doing here to share with you later. And I'd like to do here copy from these two genes. And I never update one.
00:40:53.644 - 00:41:23.490, Speaker A: JSon direction apfs. What's happened? Let's see here. Let's edit the tails. No, it's not this. Let's upload. If I upload it to be out. I think I did the Tokyo wrong.
00:41:23.490 - 00:41:50.780, Speaker A: Let's fix this. Let's fix the Tokyo as well. Yes, you are right. Perfect. And then let's fix this here. You know that I have it to copies. This is good.
00:41:50.780 - 00:42:26.640, Speaker A: Okay. Out. So I prefer to unthink the album and create the album again. Something you change again. Okay. Because I'd like to have everything in the same place untin and pin out the folder again. And this is the tiger again and upload it.
00:42:26.640 - 00:42:51.720, Speaker A: Okay. I'm not using the other because I have more things inside. You are right. Open here. Let's see what change. And this was wrong before. Let's see.
00:42:51.720 - 00:43:11.686, Speaker A: Yes. Now it's good. And I love my students because you are really paying attention. Congrats guys. You are helping me so a lot to do this life and okay. I think this is good. What we change now we have this definite.
00:43:11.686 - 00:43:56.382, Speaker A: So let's update this inside my content is this part. Yes. And you can see that it's changing. Let's open only one to be sure. Good. I think now it's good. Did you saw something different? Okay, let's check the last again it and it's better to have some to put everything in the same size, same lowercase.
00:43:56.382 - 00:44:11.000, Speaker A: Don't do this. Okay. This is not the best pretzel. But I got images from different places. All of these are my pictures. I took them. Okay.
00:44:11.000 - 00:44:38.752, Speaker A: The album is done. But this was the flower that I must check the contact live because I did it. The images is here. So what am I doing? I have three mages that I'd like to rotate these images on my NFT. So the same NFT can have a different image. And this will be changed. You can change like every day, every hour.
00:44:38.752 - 00:45:07.700, Speaker A: I change it every minute. Okay. So I have it in interval of this. It will not be more the flower. It will be the photo album boot camping. So it will be this foe album. So this is the interval that I'd like to update my NFT.
00:45:07.700 - 00:45:47.856, Speaker A: My major, my NFT. In this case if I'd like to do this in 1 minute here I have 60 because I must count it using second. Okay. I may saving to initialize the time that my smart contract is being deployed. So 1 minute after this the image can change. And I may also minting one piece in my collection exactly when I'm creating the content and the safety. Mint is the partner of mint of open zeppelin.
00:45:47.856 - 00:46:27.376, Speaker A: It's not only mint. What am I doing on the safe mint? You must define who you receive the NFT. This is the talking ID that we are managing the token ID, getting the last id, incrementing the token ID, and then do this safety mink. This is done by open Zeppelin. And for the address, the talking iD. And then I'm defining that. The metadata of this first is the first position on my array.
00:46:27.376 - 00:47:04.920, Speaker A: We have a three position. Okay, great. Now I have a function, in fact, to discover what is the image that my NFT has now. So I create a function only to compare strings. And you can't compare strings directly on solidity. In order to compare strings, the best approach is to create the hash of the string because the hash should be always the same. So here we are.
00:47:04.920 - 00:48:18.370, Speaker A: We are creating the hash using the Abi encode of the first string. The two points that I'd like to compare and compare with the second is this. And why I'm doing this because I like to do the photo album stage to discover like and photo album, not stage, photo album index. And I would like to discover which is the index that is my album now. And I'm comparing the strings or zero or one or two. Okay, so this is photo 10 one, photo zero two, and photo zero three. Right? If you not one or two, because I only have a tree, it will be three.
00:48:18.370 - 00:48:55.532, Speaker A: Only this. And this is not a flower anymore. So let's change this to update, to rotate photo. It's like album that you are flapping, you are rotating the photos, you can give the token ID. And now I must check where I am now. What is happening? I'm changing here. If it's more than two, I'd like to come back to the first.
00:48:55.532 - 00:50:01.110, Speaker A: Okay, and what I do here, flower staging, set token token ID new. But instead of this, let us do in a different theory, if it's greater than two, if it's in fact two, we'd like to use the zero one that we create here. So I may come back to zero. Okay, let's see if I may write. Yes, it's going to zero else. I'm doing this part. Okay, so I'll see what we are doing.
00:50:01.110 - 00:50:35.660, Speaker A: I'm increasing. Not the flower stage, it's the photo album index stage plus one. Then create the new. I think this is good now. Next, this is the automation part. I didn't talk with you about the automation, so I'm doing this and explain a bit in the practical way. Then we are understand this later.
00:50:35.660 - 00:52:02.240, Speaker A: Okay. It's supposed to do Santa and here is the checkup keep. In the checkup keep, this is the point. What do you do here? This is what is supposed to not, doesn't make sense to have this here now because the idea was if it was a flower and the flower is in the latest stage, I'm not growing the flower anymore. So here I'm saying that I may only updating the flower if the stage is not the last, but if I like to rotate the photo always this doesn't make sense anymore. So here I'm saying that I will update only if it's zero or one, if it's two, it's not doing nothing anymore. So probably I will take this off, okay, take this off.
00:52:02.240 - 00:53:05.362, Speaker A: And the perform upkeep we use to check up keep is to check the conditions to automate your function. And I know that I didn't talk about automation yet, but let's do this in a few minutes. The checkup keep is the condition that you'd like to update your NFT. The performer keep is the condition that you are really updating the NFT. So here check the condition here execute your business rule. In our case you are checking the timing, we should check the ID. So I'd like to update only the last token in my collection and then I got it only the last on my collection and then I must do something here.
00:53:05.362 - 00:53:38.456, Speaker A: But probably I did something wrong here. Never will be true. Waiting. Let's see what I can do here. Yeah, I don't need to check nothing of this now. It's like we have another condition. Yes, I prefer to maintain this here and I will not do this part.
00:53:38.456 - 00:54:18.536, Speaker A: Okay, are you maintaining this part in the order? Yes, exactly. This is great. We have one NFT collection and the three tokens. Not three tokens. Table we have three kind of tokens. You can have 100 tokens in this collection, but these 100 tokens can have only three different images. Is this the point? Okay, because I prefer, and we are creating the rules now.
00:54:18.536 - 00:54:58.016, Speaker A: So the rule is if I am on the last image, it is done, I will not rotate anymore. So this is not working on this way, instead of this you'll be the hidden that was before. So if I am in the last image, you not do nothing anymore. And here I'm doing all the others. Okay, now make sense. It is. So I may checking here and if it's less than two, I'm not in the last image.
00:54:58.016 - 00:55:42.144, Speaker A: Then you do the update. And this is the update. How can I do? I'm checking the timestamp to be greater than the interval. I may getting the last token minted in this collection. And only if it's not in the last image. I'm not growing flower, I'm rotating photo because it's not. And it's not flowery space, it's photo album index here now it's good.
00:55:42.144 - 00:56:11.468, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about this link. Say you understand better when we start to do this. Okay, let's create NFTs on this collection. And then it's better to you to understand this. Okay, so wait a bit more and let's do in a practical way. I think this is done is ready before share with you. I'd like to deploy myself, see that it's working.
00:56:11.468 - 00:56:45.580, Speaker A: And then I can share with you. Wait a bit more. This is a totally unexpected class because the things was not working before. But I think this is a good to you to see how to develop a class life. Okay, I think I'm here. I'm in Sepolia. Oh, by the way, did you need some tokens on Sepolia? Let's fund the faucet for you.
00:56:45.580 - 00:57:14.396, Speaker A: If you need tokens, get it now. And today we are using link. So let's fund you. Let's help you first. Jeez. And let's put ten here, ten here. Okay, confirm and try to use the official faucet.
00:57:14.396 - 00:57:47.770, Speaker A: But if you can use this, let's send now some link. Not sepolia, but link. And let's send 200 links. Okay, good. Here, let's come back. I must deploy this to be sure that is working. And then share with you injected provider photo album deploy in.
00:57:47.770 - 00:58:18.330, Speaker A: But I put this time two minutes, not 1 minute. Okay, let's deploy it. So I'm doing this in a faster way now. And if it's working well, then I do again with you in a peaceful way. Slow down. Step by step. So this is my photo album.
00:58:18.330 - 00:58:51.830, Speaker A: So if I'd like to go to the test net. Test net here. Maybe if I go here now and try to get my contract, I should find it. Not yet. We must wait a bit more to the Openc listed. Okay, so let's go forward. I must go to automation.
00:58:51.830 - 00:59:36.100, Speaker A: Not here. Automation. This is the automation again. I'm doing this so fast to be sure that it's working and not explain nothing. Now it and I must find this two links. So this is the part related to the automation. I will explain the automation for you later.
00:59:36.100 - 01:00:12.900, Speaker A: I direct you only to be sure that everything is working. And let's try again. Not I would do a tricky guys. When you try to get something on test net you can see go here and change it directly. The image is not here probably. Maybe the problem is shopping C and not my flower. Maybe because the image is not here.
01:00:12.900 - 01:00:45.466, Speaker A: You can see here that the collection exists but didn't appear. Oh, it's a shame. I will go forward a few and probably tomorrow you will do something extra with this. Let's go together. Okay, so it's time to do this. To understand better, I will come here back to explain two points more and then we are doing together. So we create this much concrete.
01:00:45.466 - 01:01:34.300, Speaker A: I did it now and I show you how to list on opensea. And how can we have a dynamic NFT? This is the original idea. Let's create a flower with three stage. Now we are creating an album that is rotating the image, a photo album and what has happened. What is different with an NFT dynamic NFT structure? What can I update on chain? I can update the metadata URL. I'm doing this on this example. Or maybe you have different images but you'd like to change the metadata inside theismatch content.
01:01:34.300 - 01:02:42.858, Speaker A: Or you can update it directly out the JSON. Okay, these are some alternatives. This is the easiest that I did now and we are doing this probably with the VRF session because I'd like to combine both here. How can we update NFTs with blockchain oracles? Let's talk about the chain link automation. Why we have chain link automation? These match contacts are not self executed. It means that the smart contract didn't know if the time passed or if some conditional condition change inside my rule, my content. In order to do this I must cow a function inside theismatch content and then theismatch content can check this for me.
01:02:42.858 - 01:03:39.934, Speaker A: Example, imagine that I have a payment, a compensation, a payment to receive every first day of the month and this will be paid by a smart contract. The smart contract alone cannot know where when is the first day of the month. I should call the smart contact every day, call some function over there and ask you, hey, smart contact, today is the first day of the month. Can I receive? And probably the answer will be no and no and no until now 1 February. So this much content cannot do this itself. One way to solve this is to use the automation to count as much content to you. Okay, you can create develop a bot in a centralized cloud.
01:03:39.934 - 01:04:30.108, Speaker A: Yes you can. But again, we are in a decentralized world so would you like to do this in a decentralized way? And this is automation okay, so our chaining automation is a decentralized network of nodes. These nodes are monitoring that checkup keep function that I told you before. And inside the checkup keep function you will put the conditions that you'd like to have to update something inside your NFT. And then you have this process. So there are off chain part. That is the automation node is the dawn of automation.
01:04:30.108 - 01:05:14.944, Speaker A: They will simulate the checkup keep. And then if the conditions are true, they you see that you are going to the automation register concept. And then they broadcast the perform upkeep function to the blockchain. But it's interesting to you to check that. First of all, this is simulated. So this simulated part doesn't cost nothing for you. Only when you are doing the performance keeping and the performance keep has a true value, you be successful on the simulation way.
01:05:14.944 - 01:05:51.130, Speaker A: Then this you broadcast the right transaction to the network. Okay? Yes, Rama, you can use automation to trigger contract function. This is the main goal. You have three kinds of trigger on automation. And I will talk with you later. When I saw this, this is something he surfaced for you. So you have this on the slides that you have now.
01:05:51.130 - 01:06:15.470, Speaker A: And how can we automate the dynamic NFT? We have the NFT address and then we go. Not here. Let's update. This is wrong. I got an OD version. Yes, now is right. Let's do this now live.
01:06:15.470 - 01:07:09.570, Speaker A: So come back here. And first of all, don't forget to connect your wallet like always. So for the people that is arriving now, connect your wallet on remix. And we are on Sepolia today. So Metamask Sepolia, then go to remix and this should appear Sepolia. Now let's create the photoalbung soft. Let's begin.
01:07:09.570 - 01:07:38.760, Speaker A: And don't cut the code, only copy it. Let's go. This is a good point. Give me a minute. This is a good point to get everything. Because it's the point that someone can delete everything. So wait, I am on the other screen only for a minute.
01:07:38.760 - 01:08:13.628, Speaker A: Let's do this. Okay, I have a copy of the bed. Now let's go. This is my photo album and you can copy and paste like me. Then, now that I explain a bit about automation, let's directly deploy. Someone cut but you give it back. Okay, deploy.
01:08:13.628 - 01:09:11.240, Speaker A: The parameter is one. So 100 seconds is two minutes. This is the code where I am. Okay, here we are. So the deploy here, the updating terravao. Then you can add here your name and photo album address. Let's wait for you.
01:09:11.240 - 01:09:50.310, Speaker A: Thank you guys. I'm really? In the fire? Live in, out? Yes, summer, this is a great question. I will share this with you in a minute. Okay. When we are going to the automation website. Oh, someone here? Kissford. You put the contact, not the address? Yes, it's happened.
01:09:50.310 - 01:10:23.430, Speaker A: And the link say I didn't forgot you. Okay. We are doing this in a practical way in a few minutes. How we are today? Let's see. Okay. So good. A lot of concrete.
01:10:23.430 - 01:10:56.990, Speaker A: I'm so happy. Not totally happy. You know that I like to understand what's happened with my collection. Something changed. Like this. Not showing. I did this a few hours before and nothing.
01:10:56.990 - 01:11:16.910, Speaker A: Let's close it. Some parts that we are not using today. How are you? Okay. A lot of content. Great. Oh, great. This is interesting.
01:11:16.910 - 01:11:53.560, Speaker A: This is not an ahold, this is a warning. Here I have the same warning. You don't need to worry about this. Why I have this? Because I can do the automation part. Passing some parameter that you create inside the automation platform, the website. But I'm not using the check data and the performing data. But I maintain it here in order to use this in the future.
01:11:53.560 - 01:12:22.940, Speaker A: So I have this warning. But this is not a neighbor. Okay. Not an Ejor. Oh, do you have another? This is not mine. You can compile. Let's see.
01:12:22.940 - 01:12:57.850, Speaker A: Okay, then you check if you have. First of all the auto compile selected. Check if you are in the right version. Try to compile manually. Or hit fresh remix and connect again with your wallet. Daniel put 120. Don't put any point.
01:12:57.850 - 01:13:25.890, Speaker A: Maybe you can check if you put some space before or later. Okay. And Joel, please share your collection with us. Oh, maybe something with my browser. Maybe. Yes. So next point.
01:13:25.890 - 01:13:59.150, Speaker A: Let's take the hood off. Here's. Sometimes the gas is high. So this is the smart contract. I think we have a lot. So now what we are doing. Let's explore this first before go to the automation part again.
01:13:59.150 - 01:14:26.996, Speaker A: Here we are. This is my content. If first go to the balance of. Yeah. Expand photo album. Balance off your wallet. Your address.
01:14:26.996 - 01:14:38.664, Speaker A: Wallet. Let's see. Supposed to meet you. Have you won? Let's see. At my wallet here. Go to balance off. Yes, I have you one.
01:14:38.664 - 01:15:11.640, Speaker A: This is good. Let's mint another. So go to safe mint. Another nft in your collection. So let's do the safe mint part. This is my address that I was here. Let's put on safe mint.
01:15:11.640 - 01:16:14.800, Speaker A: Probably because we have a lot of people now the network is congested. Network is busy. Look this. Check in the browser a bit. You don't need to do this. Okay, application clearly the second. But it's working.
01:16:14.800 - 01:16:57.010, Speaker A: Yes, related to the browser. You saw that I cleared the data. Maybe the flower is working. Okay, new project. So I'd like to you to do the safe mint at least twice. Okay, it. Let's do one more time.
01:16:57.010 - 01:17:40.722, Speaker A: It it. Okay, here we are. So if I go to balance off, I must have a tree. Maybe I can mint tigers for you later if I go to my photo album. Let's see. I have a tree now. One that still don't appear, but the other.
01:17:40.722 - 01:18:41.390, Speaker A: Yes, it's better. And like where is linse? You can see now that I have three of these and all of them have the same image. Are you mint more especially to show you what's happened, I'd like to have five tz. I saw this kind of an eho when I was not in the right version here. Please check if you are on this version. Solidity 0.8.19. Okay, let's go here.
01:18:41.390 - 01:19:38.830, Speaker A: Yes, because if you are on Testnet and on collection, it will appear in the right way. And you can see that one of that already changed because of the automation. You create another collection to use it. Automation. Wait, I should create another to automate with you update 100 and now it will be 60 seconds for me. Okay, let me create a new one. Let's have it to solve here.
01:19:38.830 - 01:20:52.450, Speaker A: Yes, I have it to now because I need to do the automation part of you and mint at least three tokens. Mint and Nicole. Nicole, be sure that you are here on the injected provider metamask. Maybe the problem is because you are not connected in the network. Okay, now I have list three, I mean to the last. And then we are going to have the automation part before go to the automation part. Let's go together to the openc.
01:20:52.450 - 01:21:48.956, Speaker A: If I go here searching your content. Okay, let's do it. So I copy it here. Go to open C and check my context here. Photo album, chain link collection. And now it's working. And the links.
01:21:48.956 - 01:22:22.876, Speaker A: I remember that here we have three kinds of pictures. Three different pictures. But now I have four NFGs that have the same picture. And if I go. Let's open one of these. If you put the mouse on the image, you can see down here, you can see the index of that image. So this is zero, three, one and two.
01:22:22.876 - 01:23:08.024, Speaker A: Let's open. What is the zero? This is the index of my Nft. So I have four images on my NFT collection. Four NFTs, but each of them has a different index. This is the index zero. Because of this I can say that this is unique because they have different identifiers, different indexes, but they can have the same image. Before changing the image in an automatically way, let's do this in a manually way to understand.
01:23:08.024 - 01:24:16.700, Speaker A: I'd like to you to get the photo album index of token zero. So on remix index zero. And then for example, I'd like to do something index one is better if you have more than one. If I go here on remix and here the photo album index of the second NFT index one. Here you can see that the second NFT has the image zero is the first URL on our list. Okay. And this is.
01:24:16.700 - 01:24:45.940, Speaker A: Let's grow only this. It's not grow anymore, but let's rotate this. So I'd like to go to rotate photo. I'm doing this manually. I didn't start the automation part yet. So rotate photo index one. Rotate photo index one.
01:24:45.940 - 01:26:01.250, Speaker A: Here we are. And if you go back here again, should he turn 1 hour first jSon. And this is the second JSon. So what we did now we change the second NFT to show the second image. Let's check. But probably this is not updated on Opensea how to refresh on openc. Open the image.
01:26:01.250 - 01:26:31.100, Speaker A: The index one NFT example. Let's go. This is my photo album. But it is used to not be refreshing in an automatic way. So what is the one two one? This is an example for you. This is mine. So this is the one.
01:26:31.100 - 01:27:44.642, Speaker A: And I know that I change this. So I came here to the three dots and refresh metadata game and refresh and refresh the page. And now change it and money come back. It seems that Google Chrome is playing with me today. Let's try again this forced to have this. I can't believe on this. So the people that have the same problem of this.
01:27:44.642 - 01:28:17.470, Speaker A: Let's try to inspect, go to application and clear site data and then let's see if it's working. Yes. Okay. Great kiss for this. You are totally right. Yes. Computer like to start counting from zero.
01:28:17.470 - 01:28:52.054, Speaker A: But this is like to be human. You don't start having the age one. You start being a baby with zero years. And then we have months until to have the year one to be one year old. It's the same with the computer. Wait, so now the tiger changed. But he's supposed to change the.
01:28:52.054 - 01:29:32.380, Speaker A: Probably I forgot to change it here as well. And you can see that the property change like the Tokyo. The city is Tokyo. You can see how that is Tokyo now. And if I came here now I have one different. Okay, but you saw that we did this in a manually way. Now we'd like to create the automation job to change the picture to us.
01:29:32.380 - 01:30:17.930, Speaker A: But if you have four NFTs, the automation will get only the last one, not the others. Okay, let's try start the automation part. How good are you asking? One more for you. When you got your collection, please add your naming and your link collection marketplace. Put here your naming and collection URL. Like mini. This is mine and this is my bootcake.
01:30:17.930 - 01:31:04.910, Speaker A: Would you add yours as well? Let's see some collections. Kiss father. Did you like to see? Ah, nice one. Let's see. Rema. Rema has three. Great Rema, amazing lot of collections.
01:31:04.910 - 01:31:39.690, Speaker A: Okay, good to see our profile. Alex. Let's see. Ingrid. Wow, you create a lot. So amazing. Vandana, I'd like to see yours.
01:31:39.690 - 01:32:29.880, Speaker A: Great. Oh, interesting. Vandana, you create on Fuji, I create on Sepalia. Did you saw that? It's good that openc list everyone. Okay, I think you are done to go to the automation part now a lot of collections are here so let's go to chain link automation. You must go. And I have so many things here.
01:32:29.880 - 01:33:18.530, Speaker A: Automation chain link and I didn't finish it. Okay, we are here, so we go to register new upkeep. First of all connect your wallet. Yes. Constant tinos. Maybe you can try to speed up the transaction. Okay, I need to have a transaction here but try to cancel our speed up.
01:33:18.530 - 01:34:26.108, Speaker A: Okay. Fervendana is not a problem to do on Fuji because like Opensea list on Fuji and automation work on Fuji. So I would. Okay, let's go to the automation part now. I came here on automation, connected my wallet here and register new upkeep here is interesting. I forgot your name, sorry, but someone asked me about the kind of triggers that we can have. We can have three kinds of keepers only that trigger one that is only timey basic.
01:34:26.108 - 01:35:13.260, Speaker A: So if my first idea that it was the rotate when you go to the last, come back to the first. I don't need a custom logic. I can do a timey basis and I can say okay, change the image every wherever 1 minute, but inside the function that I mikalid in my content, that hot 80 major. Remember that over there I can put something if it is in the last image, go to the first. But it's tiny basic like I don't have other conditions. Because of this I come back to the idea to only change until the last image. And this is a custom logic because.
01:35:13.260 - 01:35:29.524, Speaker A: Okay, I'm using a tiny but also I have the rule that if you go to the last image, it's done. You not change anymore. Okay. Another trigger. That. It's a new trigger. So amazing as well.
01:35:29.524 - 01:35:56.444, Speaker A: It's the log trigger. Remember that we learn a bit related to emit events in our smart context. Like when we did the CCIp transfer. We meet an event saying that that transfer happened. We can have a trigger related to events. Some event will be triggered. Then you can do something inside your content.
01:35:56.444 - 01:36:23.886, Speaker A: Okay, I like this. Let's come back now. It's a custom lodge key. Remember that. Okay. Oh, I'm adding more in the faucet. Okay, let's see how is the faucet.
01:36:23.886 - 01:36:44.290, Speaker A: Yes, we have people that need here. Let's add more. More. 20. No, it. Zero. No.
01:36:44.290 - 01:37:31.558, Speaker A: Okay, let's send some link as well. Not sepolia link. So the people that need link. Yes, in some minutes. Here, there are more tokens in the faucet. You can use it. Okay, so custom logic.
01:37:31.558 - 01:38:19.640, Speaker A: Let's go forward. Next, the target contact address is our contacts copy. Come back here and paste. And don't worry about this because we didn't eat the scan verification. So this is not a problem to us. Upkeeping. Name it.
01:38:19.640 - 01:38:54.410, Speaker A: Photo album automation. Like this. And only this. Starting balance on link. We are paying link to do this. Okay, let's start with three links. Three and only this.
01:38:54.410 - 01:39:27.950, Speaker A: Then go to register upkeep. Are you checking yours, Vandana? Let's finish this. So here we are. I'm awaiting the upkeep to be done. And let's go to the last that Vandana did. This is Sepolia. Yes.
01:39:27.950 - 01:39:38.050, Speaker A: You have. You won on Sepolia. One picture, one album with three as well. This is on Sepolia. Great. You did too. Amazing.
01:39:38.050 - 01:40:04.490, Speaker A: And terminal lies. When you subscribe it to this, it's here. If you scroll down, you can see the link of all the days. The days that pass it. You can see any of this. Okay. If I go here, this is the second day.
01:40:04.490 - 01:40:37.410, Speaker A: Okay. So I can edit this for you to help you. So all sessions are here. Let's go forward. Probably you are here with me. You created. Yes.
01:40:37.410 - 01:40:56.160, Speaker A: View upkeep. This is my upkeep. And you can see that the balance is not three anymore. Because probably. And you note the bit is bigger. You must note this. My balance.
01:40:56.160 - 01:41:21.870, Speaker A: I added three, but I don't have a tree anymore. It means that it's executed at least once. The minimum balance is this. If I have it less than this, you'll not be executed. And here we are I funded and the condition was executed. Maybe if you refresh it will be executed. Yes, if it was executed twice now.
01:41:21.870 - 01:41:57.156, Speaker A: And this nft you not change anymore the last image. If I create a new image, you change it. So this is my photo album. Let's refresh it. And what is the last index? Q three. This is the tree and we know that openc didn't do it automatically. So three dots top right corner.
01:41:57.156 - 01:42:53.760, Speaker A: Refresh metadata and let's see if now it's good. It's supposed to be the tiger tree. Come back to the first. No. Yes, let's fight with this again. Inspect application, clear site data and try again. Yes, now it's good.
01:42:53.760 - 01:43:44.990, Speaker A: So this tiger, you're not changing the picture anymore because it's in the last. And wait, come back. This is the index two and the index zero. You not change only can change manually because they are not the last. This I change manually and this is the last that was changed updated in automatically way. So if you create one more now and we can start to create two others as well. Safe mint.
01:43:44.990 - 01:44:18.740, Speaker A: Wait to confirm this and let's compare with the automation. It's still painting. Done. If I come here now you have five. Not yet. Come on. Yes, now I have five.
01:44:18.740 - 01:44:57.180, Speaker A: If I came to here probably already updated once. Not yet. It was two minutes or 1 minute, I don't remember. But let's wait a bit here. Yes, you can see that color the third time. And what I'd like to show you is for this. Let's try to update this before opens up in QMe.
01:44:57.180 - 01:45:36.310, Speaker A: I know that I have a problem so I'm going direct to the inspect application. Clear comeback. Not yet. It's keyword on openc. Not yet. Oh yes, you can see that this. Change it and change it here.
01:45:36.310 - 01:46:05.240, Speaker A: And I have the same problem. Yes, I try another browser later. I need to do this. What I did. Now let's try one more. And in fact now it went to the order. You can see that it's kidding me because here is right, but not here.
01:46:05.240 - 01:46:48.400, Speaker A: But you can see that change. And when the automation run the next time. When I have four automations. I know that you be like this now. And we have a collection with a lot of different NFTs. But we have only three different images. So the NFT is alternating between these images remote.
01:46:48.400 - 01:47:34.032, Speaker A: If you refresh your remix, probably you lost the contact address. How can we solve this? Go to your metamask and probably you can see the contract creation. Must be this contract creation. Contract creation and open the contract creation view on block Explorer like contact creation. And this is the address of your collection. Okay. And if you add in the pet, tell us your name.
01:47:34.032 - 01:48:32.620, Speaker A: I can check in the pet. So if you copy it later, you know that you can come back here with the photo album, open it and use it at the address. I think you are almost. This is a good question. Why is the last tiger that is changed by automation table? This was the rule that I defined. I could define it in a different way like doing a loop, try to update all of them. But I decided to update only the last.
01:48:32.620 - 01:49:17.912, Speaker A: And where is this on my code? Because the code is the true. You can see here on the perform upkeep that here I'm checking the last token. The current is like the last index because we start young zero. The current minus one is the token ID of the last that we minted. And then I'm asking here to rotate photo only for this token ID. If I'd like to rotate it more, I could. I could do like a loop a for loop and rotate more.
01:49:17.912 - 01:49:50.868, Speaker A: If you'd like to rotate how in the album? This is tricky. Probably not working with. If you create so many NFTs you will have out of gas is not working. So you must take care. How will be the gas here? Okay, but is this. It's only the last because I defined this here. If it was the timey basic, imagine that I only checking the time.
01:49:50.868 - 01:50:34.390, Speaker A: This is timey basic, but it's timey basic plus be the last. Okay, if it's only time, for example, maybe I can do this how they rotate photo directly from the time based automation. Not on this way. I do not do this, but should we understand some example for you copy and go to information. I am not finished. Only here time based. Next the content.
01:50:34.390 - 01:51:21.984, Speaker A: Now I must pass to the ABI the application binary interface the functions that my content has. How can I get this? If I go to remix some place here I have the ABI copy. I came into solid compiler copy the ABI paste here. Next. Now the automation knows all the functions that my content has. I'd like to use the rotate photo and use another ID for example. So with this, if you'd like to do in only timey basis they could call this function directly.
01:51:21.984 - 01:52:16.020, Speaker A: But you rotate only one. The portuguese students, they create a telegram group and they will still work together later creating projects. So we can do the same with here. Okay, I will do one more time the ABI. How to get an Abi? I came to the solidity compiler icon four and then my photo album is opened. If I scroll down is Mao here? Copy Abi Chuk Clippy board it's here. Okay.
01:52:16.020 - 01:52:59.230, Speaker A: On the left side and let's see. I did this with you. I have two copies of this so I can take this off. We did the automation part now give me some minutes. I wait you here if you need to do some question are you added the task? Let's add the task for you to do in the phone. I mean another computer now. Okay, wait 1 minute.
01:52:59.230 - 01:54:40.850, Speaker A: This is another computer photo album automation for automation where you ask two points for you iOS first the address and then iOS your automation job. Okay? It creating during section six and then it. It's automation link automation URL for your job. We used to say that this is a job, okay? Not this here. Automation sepolia and this is the job. I'm asking you to edit this for me. Okay, the link of the job let's put the explanation get the URL of your job.
01:54:40.850 - 01:56:14.190, Speaker A: I think it's this and I will put an example of this for you. The form is updated and iOS G's form automation URL example photo album address okay. These two. I just added it now probably you already can do it. Oh great guys, I like to have this here to know how many did it here. You can do this here as well. So this is mine.
01:56:14.190 - 01:56:53.420, Speaker A: Perfect. Wow, this is really amazing. Yes. London I will join you. I may not promise that I will be so active over there because I used to have a lot of groups and messages and it's hot but I try some moments I pass around see what happened. But I'm so glad that this group is trying to be together. Try to learn more, to study.
01:56:53.420 - 01:57:37.312, Speaker A: This will be amazing guys. I'm pretty sure that this year you'll be the year of your life. You'll be really amazing because you will starting so well, so committed studying and this will make a difference for you. Thank you. You are welcome. Yes, a lot of contacts. I think we are almost finishing and you can see that I used to ask in the task form the same tasks that I asked you do here.
01:57:37.312 - 01:58:23.980, Speaker A: So it's only copy and paste for you. So amazing and great work boys and girls. I'm so proud of you. I'm really enjoying to do this course to teach because for us, for the teachers to have this kind of interaction make difference and you help me a lot. You are helping each other in the chat. I'm really so proud of. It's really, really amazing.
01:58:23.980 - 01:59:09.290, Speaker A: Alex, what's the step to force rotation. Great question here on remix. If I go to my album and rotate, I must say which index I'd like to rotate. And this is the NFT index. Choose the one and do it. Let's rotate the two now, I think. Okay.
01:59:09.290 - 01:59:38.040, Speaker A: Thank you, Kisford. Your explanations are so useful. Thank you so much. You are helping me a lot. And I think it's just for today. I read past the time it was really 2 hours today and. Well, see you tomorrow.
01:59:38.040 - 01:59:39.220, Speaker A: Bye.
