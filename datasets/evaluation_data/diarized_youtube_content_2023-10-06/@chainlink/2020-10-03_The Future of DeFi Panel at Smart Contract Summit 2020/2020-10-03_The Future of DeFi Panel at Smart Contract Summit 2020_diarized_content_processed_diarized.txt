00:00:06.490 - 00:00:08.330, Speaker A: The next panel is the future of Defi.
00:00:08.410 - 00:00:12.858, Speaker B: It's going to be moderated by Cooper Turley from Defi rate, and, yeah, I'll.
00:00:12.874 - 00:00:30.566, Speaker A: Leave it to it. Awesome. Thank you, Adam. Yeah, so today we're going to be talking about future of Defi. We've got some awesome projects here from a bunch of different verticals. We've got Misha from monolith loom from RenVM, Eric from injective protocol. So we're hopefully going to be joined by Bradley from unstoppable domain as well.
00:00:30.566 - 00:00:32.002, Speaker A: Awesome. What's up, Bradley?
00:00:32.066 - 00:00:33.000, Speaker B: How's it going?
00:00:33.690 - 00:00:47.960, Speaker A: Doing well, doing well. I'd love to kick it off and give each of you guys a quick second to give an elevator pitch about what you're know. Obviously, I know that we're limited on time, so I just want to sort of keep it brief, but it would be great for people to get a high level primer on what you guys are working on. So, Misha, let's kick it off with you.
00:00:49.130 - 00:01:10.980, Speaker C: Hi, I work at a place called monolith. We're trying to change the relationship which people have with their banks. We're the first non custodial visa debit card attached to Ethereum and what we're aiming to do is show that we can give users the same experience as their current account without taking their money.
00:01:11.590 - 00:01:13.950, Speaker A: Awesome. Eric, you want to give a primer on injective?
00:01:14.030 - 00:01:35.830, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So hi everyone, I'm Eric Chen, CEO and co founder of Injective. Injective is a fully decentralized L2 derivative exchange. So basically you can trade any type of market as long as there's a price feed the market creation is open and permissionless and we support a wide range of financial derivatives starting from perpetual swaps and cfds and expiries futures.
00:01:35.990 - 00:01:38.620, Speaker A: Awesome. Lung, talk about Ren real quick.
00:01:39.070 - 00:02:02.820, Speaker D: Yeah. Hey everyone, my name is Lung. I'm the co founder of Ren Project and what we're building is a decentralized bridge for bitcoin to Ethereum and other chains as well. So our goal in the long term is to be able to connect as many different chains as know. We recently went to mainnet with bitcoin, zcash, bitcoin, cash and Ethereum. And soon we'll be able to provide same bridges to Polkadot as well.
00:02:03.990 - 00:02:06.580, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. And Bradley, why don't you take it away?
00:02:06.950 - 00:02:29.738, Speaker E: So hi everybody, I'm Brad. I'm one of the co founders at unstoppable domains. We are building tools to onboard people to the decentralized web. So we have a blockchain domain registry called crypto. We also have a registrar, unstoppabledomains.com, where you can buy domains and manage them. And then we also have a set of web tools where you can easily deploy websites to ipfs even if you.
00:02:29.744 - 00:02:30.780, Speaker D: Don'T know how to code.
00:02:31.790 - 00:02:56.498, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. One of the great things I love about this panel is everyone's sort of touching a different vertical of defi, and it's kind of at the fringes with sort of these interesting use cases. I think we've seen a lot of development in lending sectors, decentralized exchanges, but everyone on this panel is working on something that's a nice component to that. So I'd love to sort of focus on that composability aspect for this panel, I guess. Long to start off. You guys have seen a lot of success with Ren BTC so far.
00:02:56.498 - 00:03:06.520, Speaker A: Do you think that's something that's going to end up happening on a lot of other chains too, or do you primarily see you guys as bitcoin is the killer bridge use case, and that's going to be our focus for a long period of time here.
00:03:08.010 - 00:03:59.110, Speaker D: I think bitcoin will be the main piece of liquidity that we see moving between chains for the same reason that it's the main piece of liquidity we see just in general. It's just the most popular people know about it the most and kind of everything kind of correlates with it. But I do expect that we'll see some interesting specific use cases for other chains that we've been looking at. So there's a few chains that we've been looking at bridging for specific purposes, that have specific use cases that have been proposed that they feel interoperability to Ethereum or to other chains would be beneficial for. And I think those will be pretty exciting to see. One of the ones that I'm particularly interested in seeing is stablecoins moving around and being able to use assets from different chains to collateralize stablecoins on different chains, but then use those stablecoins anywhere. So I'm pretty interested to see that personally.
00:03:59.850 - 00:04:21.120, Speaker A: Definitely. I know that one that I'm keeping an eye on is the terra blockchain with what they're doing with Luna and payments in Korea, something that I've seen sort of lofted around and yeah, just cool use cases like that, right, where people want to trade on uniswap, but they can't really do it without going to a centralized exchange. To me at least, Renbridge is a great way to take those to Ethereum and sort of unlock this liquidity in the ways that DeFi traders are pretty used to at this point.
00:04:21.570 - 00:04:34.838, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think the lunar guys have done an awesome job of taking a stable coin and making it deeply integrated with what you might call the real world. And being able to bridge that to Ethereum will help it hook into DeFi as well.
00:04:34.964 - 00:04:48.874, Speaker A: I was going to say, speaking of the real world, Brad, I know that you guys had your largest sales to date yet on a crypto domain. Curious to hear your take on sort of that domain in particular. What you think the intentions might have been behind it or why it was this nefarious domain that ended up selling for so much money.
00:04:49.072 - 00:05:51.980, Speaker E: Well, I think everybody knows that the domain in question here is sex crypto, which sold for $90,000 on the secondary market, which I believe was the largest NFT sale on OpenC ever. This was a couple of days ago, and I think we could all use our imaginations, but I think porn and other content like that was a very early use case for the traditional web. It may be that we see things like that in the decentralized web on the early side of the adoption curve as well. But the other thing maybe to call out is just that there's a lot of intersections, of course, between Defi and Dweb. But I think this is just sort of an emerging proof point that I guess the financialization of Dweb is also happening, coming whatever. And it's this other kind of narrative that is getting ready to be intertwined. And there's actually a lot of ways that it's going to start getting much closer with Defi in the near future.
00:05:52.590 - 00:06:03.262, Speaker A: Yeah, what does that look like to you when we talk about a centralized domain? How do you see that interfacing with Defi? Is it that every trader has their own decentralized domain? It's that companies are hosting their own sites, or what do you envision happening there?
00:06:03.316 - 00:07:11.702, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think there's a really big problem with Defi, which is this kind of jurisdiction regulation problem, because ultimately I think a lot of the things that people have been trying to build have been protocols. And then you have this issue where, okay, I have this protocol, but then I want to make sure that there's an interface for people to go and interact with it rather than just interacting directly with the smart contract at the command line level. And so the moment you have this interface, then all of a sudden you have an individual or a company and an admin and a registrant, and you have the liability. And what you can do with a decentralized domain name that you couldn't do with the traditional one is you could have a DaO control the domain name and the website. You could have a community anywhere in the world control it. And then the Defi applications themselves don't need to, or, sorry, the Defi protocols themselves don't need to build the application layer, and then that removes them from having to do the part that potentially would lead to regulation or them being a financial services company or whatever. There's Kyber crypto or Kyber network has a decentralized website.
00:07:11.702 - 00:07:33.820, Speaker E: There's a few other Defi apps that are already doing this. And when we're talking to know, they're essentially saying, we expect some sort of regulation is going to be coming. And then the place where the biggest problems are going to be happening is on the front end. And if you can go and put that on the dweb and turn that over to the community, then you essentially have an answer to the jurisdiction problem.
00:07:34.670 - 00:07:55.800, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. I think that's a really good transition to what Misha is working on at monolith. I know that you guys are really focused on just helping people in the european jurisdiction better use their DeFi assets and sort of take hold of this sovereign nature. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the hurdles you guys had to face with regulations and getting your visa card approved and hopefully what that looks like today and sort of the future plans that you guys have for that?
00:07:56.170 - 00:08:44.766, Speaker C: Yeah, I think regulation is really interesting. All the big nations came together under FATF and have clubbed together under this idea of AMLD five, which is the fifth anti money laundering directive. And it was an ambiguous statement which basically said, hey, guys, crypto, we need to start looking at this is what the kind of agreement was at the nation states, and then each countries gave it, picked a regulator internally. The UK picked the financial services or the conduit Authority, which is our financial service regulator. And they've turned around and actually, they've.
00:08:44.798 - 00:08:45.380, Speaker B: Been.
00:08:48.310 - 00:09:35.822, Speaker C: More conservative, actually, than the original fat position. So in the UK, they have this concept of a virtual asset service provider, which if you're someone who's written a smart contract and they can identify who you are, and if you are either selling goods to a uk person or you are a uk entity or belong in the UK, you can't enable a swap, for example, under UK law, and the regulator requires KYC on swaps. So, I mean, we as a business believe in self sovereign assets. We're non custodial. We are an entity. We're not decentralized finance. Ultimately, I think even the US government can knock on our door at any point and jail.
00:09:35.822 - 00:10:16.254, Speaker C: So we have to act as good citizens. I think all we can do is try and push people and kind of educate people to why we're trying to do this. I think when we went to our regulator and we took it to them first and we went, hey guys, I can produce something which kind of feels like a current account, but I have no systemic risk to my users. I can't mess with my users bank account numbers. I can't do nefarious stuff with their money. How about you letting me have a go at this? And they were actually quite open to it. I think I was pleasantly surprised.
00:10:16.254 - 00:11:17.220, Speaker C: I come from a web tech background, not a finance background, not a regulation background, and they were very interested. They were interested in what it meant to not be able to fiddle with people's money. So where we are now, we've applied under the FCA's current regime, and we'll hear back by the end of the year. I guess what's scary about this is that a business like ours in the UK now wouldn't be able to start up without asking the regulator first anymore. So I think times are changing. I think the key for us is being able to challenge this idea as a service provider, that you have to take deposits, and if we can build a service like a Spotify where you don't own the music, but you get a nice service of music. If we can bring people a nice service of Defi and not have to trust us, yeah, we think the regulator will be on board with that and we're trying to take them on that.
00:11:18.150 - 00:11:53.914, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really interesting. I think that one of the bigger pieces of news this week in DeFi was Aave getting its EMI license, so being able to do fiat onramps. But what was interesting to me was the fact that Ave Limited is the one that's going to be doing that onboarding. There's going to have to be some KYC involved for at least a step of that process. I think that, optimistically, we all envision depositing USD and then it's automatically just deposited into ave earning interest. But like this on ramp hurdles, we're all sort of figuring out what that looks like. And it seems like, at least for the foreseeable future, there really is going to be this sort of eye over the shoulder, watching everyone that enters into Defi, making sure it's done properly.
00:11:53.914 - 00:12:02.190, Speaker A: And while that's definitely awesome and necessary, it definitely is an interesting look at what I think we're all trying to build here with decentralized finance and self sovereignty.
00:12:02.350 - 00:12:20.310, Speaker C: Can I say one thing to this? I think what makes me sad about my role and what we're building is I think this was the promise of fulfilling for the underbanked and what we're doing is just fulfilling services for the overbanked and rich people in western countries. And that makes me sad. We'll get there, hopefully.
00:12:21.530 - 00:12:50.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And I think that's actually a good point because right now on Ethereum mainnet, I think that a lot of the small people have gotten boxed out. It's basically just a whales game trading really anything on DeFi and any use case outside of DFI has just gotten completely stamped out. So I guess Eric passing it over to you, I know that you guys are planning on building on L2. You are building on layer know. Was that an intentional design decision from day one prior to this whole gas wars thing starting? Or sort of what was the thought process that led to this being just the logical choice that it is today?
00:12:51.830 - 00:13:49.670, Speaker B: Yeah, so basically we started considering about L2 or back then mainly as like a side chain solution around 2018. The key thing is that we kind of looked at how centralized exchanges work and how decentralized exchanges work. Obviously back then the most popular model was the Xerox model and we saw that you can have a centralized relayer, but still the entire exchange process is not as smooth, it's not as usable for most of the, I would say seasoned or like professional traders out there in the space because the trade turnover rate is just so low. So when you come to think of that, there are a lot of the factors you're not considering beyond just really responsive front end interface, is that as a market maker you're trying to adjust your risk level accordingly when it comes to settlement. Because when you place an order, you kind of expect execution to be immediate. You kind of expect cancellation to be immediate as well. So back in the day, there's a lot of front running when it comes to taking over cancellations, taking over existing take orders.
00:13:49.670 - 00:14:36.820, Speaker B: So we saw that there's a lot of need to have a much more faster kind of settlement layer, to have a much more responsive and much more secure kind of like order matching process. So this is kind of how we came to be. Essentially, we want to secure that entire process to make it as friendly as possible for market makers to come in and for a lot of higher liquidity providers to be able to trade securely, because back then I was also looking into market making, and I had to adjust my risk parameter and spread really conservatively. So I think that's actually one of the reasons why Dexs didn't have much liquidity back then. And right now, thanks to uniswap, there's a constant curve and the boom of DFI that created this entire rush of liquidity into it. But I think the underlying risk function is still around the same.
00:14:37.910 - 00:15:02.780, Speaker A: It's really interesting too, because one of the things of 2017 is like these silos that popped up with centralized exchanges. So you kind of had the finance of the world, which were the holy grail. But nowadays the Dex ecosystem is very composable. People are pulling liquidity from all over. There's aggregators routing it together. I'm curious to hear on your guys end, how does that fit into the trading experience you guys are able to offer and sort of the spreads and the depths and really the opportunities for traders, what does that look like?
00:15:03.310 - 00:15:53.166, Speaker B: Yeah, so basically, one thing we do have to sacrifice a little bit is just in general, like on chain composability, obviously, there are things that we can work on a little bit down the road to kind of highly improve that. That's completely within the question as well. But currently, as it stands for, the version that we're going to be putting out soon, that is something we're going to be sacrificing. Essentially, you're adding one more layer, and a lot of transactions are going to be effectively happening off ethereum chain. But I think kind of like, just in general, the way that derivatives exchanges work, the way that a lot of these derivative protocol works, you're kind of just in general being isolated from the defi ecosystem a little bit as well. We kind of don't really work like margin trading, where there's also lending pool they can get capitalized on. So just in general, I would say derivatives is kind of like self isolated in a sense.
00:15:53.166 - 00:16:19.154, Speaker B: But I think I see that as an advantage because I would say like 50% isolated from d five, but you're also 50% isolated from the Russell world. So we can introduce a lot of markets outside of the crypto world realm or even outside of traditional realm. I would say that we're kind of making the sacrifice within a DeFi composability for short term, in exchange for a lot more flexibility beyond the blockchain ecosystem.
00:16:19.202 - 00:16:43.066, Speaker A: In the long term. Yeah. And it's a pretty logical next step. I think that we're seeing specifically a derivative sector going off chain, Dydx integrating with Starcax, and then along with synthetics. Looking into optimism in the future. This L2 conversation is a pretty hot topic right now. I would love to open floor and see if any of your individual teams are looking at specific L2 projects or sort of what you guys envision for this next couple of months.
00:16:43.066 - 00:16:55.070, Speaker A: Do you envision a composable L2 ecosystem built on Ethereum, or do you think that we're going to start to see these players, like, near coming to the table and kind of siphoning this liquidity off and taking it into their own respective territory?
00:16:56.690 - 00:17:52.180, Speaker D: I personally think that once you start thinking about L2s, you start seeing the same kind of issues that we see with all the layer ones that we made, but you see it at a much lighter scale. So we have all these layer ones, polkadot, tezos, bitcoin, ethereum, that are essentially silos. And then when you think about the side chains that you create off Ethereum, they're all siloed from each other, either because they just aren't inherently capable of speaking to each other or because they're very application specific, like something in the case of injective protocol. So direct interoperability doesn't necessarily make sense. One difference is that you already have this kind of hub, so if you have these two L2s, they can kind of go back to their core hub, and they can talk to each other through that. But typically, that's a very long process. And what we've seen is that, at least from the perspective of an interoperability protocol like RenvM, all these L2s just look like layer ones to us.
00:17:52.180 - 00:18:38.610, Speaker D: So instead of having an ecosystem with four layer ones, we have an ecosystem with four layer ones and ten L2s, and they all still need the same solution, which is that they want a faster, more direct interoperability with each other. So that you can take a bitcoin, you can send it to Ethereum, and then you can take the bitcoin that's on Ethereum, and you can send it to a side chain, you can take it on that side chain, and you can send it to a side chain that's on a parachain on polka dot, and you can take that and you can send it to Tesla, that it doesn't really matter what you're going to or coming from that it just works. And it works in the same way with the same sort of user experience and the same developer experience. So at least from this perspective of interoperability, I think L2 actually makes that question all the more interesting and creates a lot of opportunity as well for these protocols.
00:18:39.510 - 00:18:42.290, Speaker C: So are you integrating other L2s?
00:18:42.950 - 00:18:45.618, Speaker D: Yeah, we have started some great.
00:18:45.704 - 00:18:46.878, Speaker C: Yeah, so a lot of the layer.
00:18:46.894 - 00:18:55.766, Speaker D: Twos are EVM compatible, which makes them trivial for RenvM to just plug into and support. And it's just a matter of community governance. Decide if that's something that wants to.
00:18:55.788 - 00:19:03.720, Speaker C: Happen, I guess, like the burner stuff, the XDai stuff, and even Amisa go and all of that. Right? Yeah. Interesting. Thank you.
00:19:04.330 - 00:19:44.520, Speaker A: Yeah, this is interesting because you just mentioned it just works. And I think that when we're talking about the future of Defi, I'm on optimistic that a user playing in this ecosystem won't have to think too much about it. As someone who's been trying out a lot of these L2 solutions, as Eric talked know, there is an extra step to getting there. You sort of have to take your assets, deposit it somewhere else, and be familiar in that ecosystem. I'd love to just sort of open the floor a little bit and know when it comes to the average user using DeFi, do you guys envision these killer use cases being sort of these L2 trading protocols, or do you envision it being sort of this layer one sort of composability with lending or Dex trading or something like that, being more attractive to the new users that come into the space and want to take advantage of some of these products that we're building today?
00:19:47.210 - 00:19:49.320, Speaker C: I can have a go, please.
00:19:50.250 - 00:20:23.486, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. Thank you. So I think just in general, for just an extremely general user, we can envision it as like a mobile front end user. What we're going to see a lot is a lot of kind of like a fast gateway or sometimes centralized. Most of the time, I would say centralized rarely. It's a decentralized gateway for them to access and interact with the entire defi stack. This is mainly due to the fact that as an app, it's just very difficult to interact directly with the Ethereum blockchain.
00:20:23.486 - 00:20:58.750, Speaker B: Obviously, you need a fiat gateway inherently. So that's why we see Dharma start working on being extremely app focused, being kind of like a fiat gateway for just in general, the defi stack. And I am extremely bullish on that, but I think that it's kind of similar to how the traditional world works as well. Basically, there's a paypal and a venmo of the world that's acting essentially like a middleman for all the inner bank transfers, and they kind of aggregate all the cash reserves, so called, before it reaches the final settlement. So we do see that there's a lot of room for faster gateways in the meantime.
00:21:00.050 - 00:21:11.140, Speaker A: Yeah, and when we talk about gateways, Brad, do you guys see yourselves with unstoppable being sort of a stepping point into defi and integratepo, or do you see yourselves as more someone who's already familiar with this space, looking to take their experience to the next level?
00:21:11.910 - 00:21:55.066, Speaker E: We definitely see ourselves as an onboarding point. I think that we're consumer facing companies, so we see ourselves as the way to get started on the dweb. And so I think there's a lot of emerging defi use cases there. And again, I think a lot of it is probably going to be around dows and putting these defi apps onto censorship resistant, onto censorship resistant websites. So that's a very natural place, but it's more for the developers than it is for the consumers. I think kind of maybe down the road there'll be points where we would be able to participate in the onboarding of consumer defi applications, but right now it's more developer defi and then consumer.
00:21:55.098 - 00:22:17.670, Speaker A: Dweb that makes sense. And I want to stick on this sort of gateway note. I know that the past few months I've really been looking into, like, how do I take these crypto assets I have and use them in the real world? Misha, I know with monolith you guys are trying to tackle this with your debit cards. Do you envision a future where sort of all of my funds can be held in crypto and sort of use seamlessly within the real world, or what are some of the blockers to being able to allow us through that in a frictionless.
00:22:19.450 - 00:23:15.418, Speaker C: I think. I don't think it will be enough to just let people do what they can do with their bank on crypto because there's going to be an overhead unless these L2s really kick off or east 2.0 comes and totally smashes it. But even then, it will always be a little bit harder to use this space. Like, you're going to have to sign stuff like use your biometrics a bit more. And I guess what we're excited by is, I think it's that changing of the dynamic again. So your bank is fundamentally interested in making money for their shareholders and as a portal to the d five world, which I think is something which we're trying to build and we're making good progress on, we can have a different relationship there.
00:23:15.418 - 00:23:45.634, Speaker C: We can kind of tell people pay us $1020 a month and we'll try and make your money go as far as possible. Whereas every other relationship which someone has or which people generally have with their money is that of it going down and their bank's bank balance just going down. I think there's some really awful stats. Actually, if you look at most of the world, I think we're probably quite lucky individuals. But most people don't like looking at their bank balance and are scared of their bank, scared of how much money.
00:23:45.752 - 00:23:47.142, Speaker B: They'Re paying out in interest.
00:23:47.276 - 00:24:07.180, Speaker C: And I think there's an opportunity to go out to people and go, hey, this is something different. And we have a different kind of a different incentive model and a different relationship until then. It's just expensive right now, so it's only going to appeal to Wales. And frankly, that's very boring to me.
00:24:07.790 - 00:24:58.858, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think it is interesting how much this defi narrative has been ingrained into me personally. So it was a funny anecdote this week I was calling one of my banks about credit card renewal fee, and I was saying like, hey, can you waive this? And they were like, no. And I started saying, what incentives do you have to keep me around? Why should I keep using your service? What rewards do you offer me taking this yield farming narrative and putting it in a traditional lens, there was no registration. It's like, yeah, you can't waive the fee, you can pay it back with some of your points, but that's about it. And so I think that that's a really interesting narrative, like specifically these incentives to keep users around and sort of incentivize them, or just tapping into lending protocols. Long, I know that you guys partnered with curve for this Ren yield farming liquidity mining campaign, which was really awesome. Can you talk a little bit about how much that actually helped with the liquidity of Ren BTC and sort of like the overall usage of the protocol as a whole?
00:24:59.024 - 00:25:38.002, Speaker D: I think our launch was really serendipitous. It came just after comp, but just before the rest of the defi yielding craze kicked off. So we were lucky to ride that wave in a mean, just from a business and marketing perspective, it made sense. Even know people were calling it yield farming necessarily. I think that was a term coined by Kane, to be honest. I just remember looking at a telegram chat and Kane and Michael from synthetics and curve respectively were just like going at it on this long tangent. About all these things you could do with the liquidity tokens or where you could put them, and then what? You'd get out and somewhere else and you could just lever up massively.
00:25:38.002 - 00:26:24.070, Speaker D: I was just like, yep, cool, whatever. I don't get this, but it certainly helps a lot. I mean, I think that we made two really good decisions when it came to launching RenBTC. One was that we launched WBTC with Kyber and think almost two years ago now, that found its way everywhere into defi. And then with curve we were able to create a stable bridge where you could go from your bitcoin to your rembtc in a permissionless way and then go in a one to one from your MBTC to WBTC and then go into whatever application it was that you actually wanted to use. Because WBTC is very difficult to actually get a hold of, to mint or to only. It's essentially just bitcoin exposure in a sense.
00:26:24.070 - 00:27:17.586, Speaker D: For most retail users, it's a synthetic that's backed one to one by bitcoin because it's not easy to redeem, whereas RenBTC is BTC in the sense that anyone in any amount can go back and forth and they all have the same relationship with the protocol. There's no special relationship that you have with the custodian. So I think that was our launch plan and the incentives just really helped us draw attention to it. I mean, really, in the grand scheme of things, the incentives weren't huge. I think over the course of four months it was something like $50,000, which for the number of users liquidity we saw it was just enough to get it bootstrapped to get people talking. And I think the difference between that and what we see as yield farming at the moment is it's not a governance token. You're not earning a portion of the ecosystem by using the ecosystem.
00:27:17.586 - 00:27:29.290, Speaker D: And it's not something that's going to happen in perpetuity. It's just something to bootstrap things. Whereas some protocols, they intrinsically bind the yield to the usage of the protocol and the governance of the protocol.
00:27:29.630 - 00:27:49.066, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's two really important things to touch on there, I think. First and foremost, the Ren bridge. If anyone hasn't used it yet, if you're looking to take your bitcoin, import it over to Ethereum, there's literally no better solution for me. I've used it multiple times now. It's a frictionless solution. There's no hurdles or anything like that. You just press the button, deposit it and then you end up getting it in metamask.
00:27:49.066 - 00:28:33.200, Speaker A: It's really a beautiful thing. I know you guys worked for a really long time on that, so definitely want to give it the badge of honor myself as a user. And I think to your second point, the narrative of yield farming is actually more enticing than actual rewards themselves. Right? So you mentioned, like, for the Ren liquidity mining campaign, you only gave out about $50,000. But just the fact that you could earn curve and Ren and SNX from putting your wrapped bitcoin somewhere, I think that that sort of like DFI token stacking thing is one which has really taken this whole narrative by storm. Right. Regardless of the amount of money you're making, it's nothing too crazy, but just like optically telling someone you're earning three tokens at once by just putting your capital somewhere is a really compelling narrative, and one that I think is only going to continue to keep stacking up more and more the further we go down this rabbit hole in the next couple of months here.
00:28:33.200 - 00:28:34.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:34.372 - 00:28:38.350, Speaker D: At the end of the day, you get a token that you can actually still use to earn yield elsewhere.
00:28:38.930 - 00:29:10.270, Speaker A: Yeah. And to your point, I do think that this whole yield farming is the product thing is getting a little bit dangerous. I think you just alluded to it really perfectly that the entire value of a lot of these new products that are launching are the yield farming itself. It's definitely an interesting distribution mechanism, but I think that we'd be wise to sort of take a deeper look at what's going on under the hood and whether or not there would be any usage if there wasn't an apy or a token to be earned from using x, Y or z. Awesome. Well, I know we're coming right up on time here. I want to sort of open up the floor for one last question here with where we're at in Defi today.
00:29:10.270 - 00:29:31.780, Speaker A: I would love to just sort of hear, like, scale of one to ten how optimistic you guys are on the sector right now. I think that there's a lot of weird directions we're headed right now. We sort of have shown that it's something that's here to stay. But I would love to just hear very briefly like the skeptic scale to the optimist scale. One being DFI is going in a terrible direction. Ten. DFI is going in the most perfect direction possible.
00:29:33.270 - 00:29:44.486, Speaker C: I'll start just because we're short on time. So, yeah, I think Defi depends what you mean by DeFi. I think stacking and stacking of different protocols on top of each other for farming kind of seems a bit.
00:29:44.588 - 00:29:44.854, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:44.892 - 00:30:05.500, Speaker C: I don't know. I don't understand it well enough. I think what I'm excited by is this thing, which looks like an economy on Ethereum right now. I think tokenization of real world assets, realt synthetics, all this stuff coming together is very sexy, and I'm optimistic about that. An eight. Nice.
00:30:08.690 - 00:30:46.502, Speaker E: I would say that I think that kind of the inevitable wave that crypto markets grow is there's all kinds of innovation going kind of from all different directions. And some of it's good and long term sustainable, and maybe some of it isn't. And everyone will almost definitely get ahead of ourselves at some point because that's also inevitable, but that's also just part of the cycle. So I think there might be some goofy things emerging now, but that's also kind of a good sign because it means that we're moving forward. So I would be like, I'm a nine. I don't mind the goofiness. I think it's inevitable.
00:30:46.502 - 00:30:55.470, Speaker E: And on the other side of the crash, behind the goofiness, is when you see what the real stuff was. And there's almost always actual real stuff from those cycles.
00:30:56.530 - 00:31:34.678, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll give it a six. Somewhat optimistic, but right now there's a lot of goofiness. Definitely like goofiness is part of it in a lot of hypergrowth type of markets. Kind of like overzealous, over passionate is just kind of like the first step. And really when it gets to the boring part, that's when we know that we're relatively more successful. Because I remember the funny part was that someone asked me about what are DeFi is going to bring on the next bull market. Back in, basically before comstar doing the token, and I was like, there's not enough tokenization of these DeFi protocols.
00:31:34.678 - 00:31:51.370, Speaker B: There's not that much value capture of these DeFi protocols, especially during that time. And then I basically said that the market cap of the total Defi protocol goes flips once and then we're good to go. We can bring another bull market and then flash forward to now. I mean, it's been a pretty crazy ride.
00:31:51.530 - 00:31:53.200, Speaker A: Yeah. Writings on the wall.
00:31:56.690 - 00:32:52.274, Speaker D: I'm just going to say, dan, I think Defi has proven everything that needed to prove so far. Given how early we are. I think that means that inherently there's a ton of risk. So it's a ten with the caveat that the risk is also ten could turn out that this experiment goes awfully and that we hit a roadblock in a year and realize, shit, this is not sustainable in any form. I think we've already seen some commentary around dows with the Darkdow paper that was published ages ago as to criticisms of whether these things are even theoretically capable of being made safe. And there's a lot of critics of how DFI worked at the moment in a lot of ways. How d is that? D defi and in some cases in yield farming, things like yam, let's say how phi is the phi? So I think ten.
00:32:52.274 - 00:32:57.410, Speaker D: I'm optimistic. The opportunity is huge and so far everything is going well, but the risk is also massive.
00:32:57.990 - 00:33:07.622, Speaker A: Absolutely awesome. Thank you guys for your time. I think that this was a great panel. Once again, thank you to chainlink for hosting us. It's been a blast. And Adam, I'll pass it back over to you, man. Thanks.
00:33:07.622 - 00:33:07.970, Speaker A: Cooper.
