00:00:00.330 - 00:00:32.146, Speaker A: You. I'm not even sure how I feel about this advice right now because I'm not so sure it's. It's completely right. But at the time, it was very good advice for me. And the advice was, you can either look backwards or you can look forwards. You can't do both. It was valuable for me at the time because there's sometimes a tendency to cycle on what went wrong or why it went wrong, or how it went wrong, or, oh, my God, something didn't work, something didn't succeed.
00:00:32.146 - 00:01:10.740, Speaker A: This, that. And I spend a good amount of time analyzing how things work and why they didn't work and why they will work differently and how to make them work differently. And it's not necessarily good to focus too much on what went wrong. I think it's good to look in that. And the thing that that advice led me to was to the idea that you have to look at how something went wrong and then you have to learn from it. So you have to make sure you learn from it. But learning from it and using that learning to go forward is different than staying there and hyper focusing on something went wrong.
00:01:10.740 - 00:01:51.500, Speaker A: And why did it go wrong? And cycling in your mind on why something didn't work out, whether it's something personal or something professional or whatever it is, I think that's useful advice that you basically ask yourself, are you spending your time looking backwards? Are you spending your time looking forwards? And funnily enough, as you think about it, the advice doesn't even say what you should do, but it kind of puts you with a choice. And the choice and the answer to the choice seems pretty obvious. So I don't know if that's the best advice for everyone or ever, but at the time, it was very good advice for me. Close.
