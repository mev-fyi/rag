00:00:00.330 - 00:01:12.238, Speaker A: You. Decentralized finance is really the first large scale, widely adopted hybrid smart contract that effectively combines trust minimized on chain code, which is made trust minimized by blockchains and their ability to come to consensus about the state changes of that on chain code. And in equal part, the ability to access external systems in a trust minimized way. And that trust minimized access to external systems is what Oracles and Oracle networks you know, the best version of an oracle mechanism is really a decentralized oracle network, which is what Chainlink is. And so Chainlink is a large collection of many at this point, hundreds of decentralized oracle networks, each performing their own distinct value and service and kind of input of data or generation of randomness or even some amount of computation for the creation of a new, more advanced hybrid smart contract. So, for example, if you look at lending, you need data about price. If you want to make a derivatives DeFi product, you need data about what's going on with the derivative.
00:01:12.238 - 00:01:42.220, Speaker A: If you want to make a weather insurance product, you need weather data, and you need that data to meet the same high standards as the contract itself. And that requires validation, consensus. Decentralized computation in the form of an oracle network and chainlink is the largest and most widely used decentralized oracle network and set of decentralized oracle networks, enabling the majority of DeFi to actually operate, rate and function correctly and.
