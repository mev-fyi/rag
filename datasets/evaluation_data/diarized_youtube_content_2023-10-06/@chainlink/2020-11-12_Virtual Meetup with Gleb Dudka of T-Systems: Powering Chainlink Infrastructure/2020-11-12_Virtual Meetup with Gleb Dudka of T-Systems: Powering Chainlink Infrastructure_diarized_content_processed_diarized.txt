00:00:14.050 - 00:00:14.600, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:15.210 - 00:00:29.190, Speaker B: We are live, so we'll give it just a couple more minutes, let some people join in here. Then here's the link for YouTube. I'll just drop this into some of our channels.
00:00:39.980 - 00:00:40.392, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:40.446 - 00:00:51.560, Speaker B: Welcome everyone who's joining us in from YouTube. Give it a couple of minutes, let some people join in here. Hey, cigar, Alexis?
00:00:51.720 - 00:00:52.140, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:52.210 - 00:01:12.496, Speaker B: Thanks a lot for joining us. We'll get started here in about 1 minute. Really excited to have gleb from t systems joining us today. Talk about everything that all the cool stuff that they're working on and how they're powering chainlink infrastructure. So should be a pretty exciting talk.
00:01:12.678 - 00:01:20.900, Speaker A: Yeah. Hello everyone. Guys. Super excited to talk. Also excited about a more, let's say more interactive q a session afterwards.
00:01:23.560 - 00:01:37.930, Speaker B: I know that your smartcom presentation was definitely one of the top commented and responded in the survey afterwards, so people really enjoyed you stepping in. I know that you even stepped in like last minute with that one too.
00:01:38.560 - 00:01:55.792, Speaker A: Yeah, but it was last minute, but not really. Anyways, we were prepared to talk about this thing, so we have a lot of discussions about this internally anyway, so last minute was not such a big deal.
00:01:55.926 - 00:01:59.648, Speaker B: Yeah, I love your background too that you got going on here.
00:01:59.814 - 00:02:04.530, Speaker A: Thanks. I had it before but I thought maybe not change it.
00:02:05.640 - 00:02:07.844, Speaker B: Yeah, it's looking good.
00:02:07.882 - 00:02:22.730, Speaker A: I guess we are in a community which doesn't. Yeah, it depends. I would say people don't really take themselves too seriously, which is a good thing. So that's cool about I guess overall crypto community as a whole.
00:02:23.180 - 00:02:30.970, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's good. It's nice seeing that coming from the enterprise side of the crypto world know gives us help.
00:02:31.920 - 00:02:32.380, Speaker A: Cool.
00:02:32.450 - 00:03:03.140, Speaker B: Well, thanks a lot everyone who's joined us today. Really excited to have Gleb Duca of T systems joining us a little bit about this presentation. Gleb's going to go into a little more details about his presentation at Smartcon. You can definitely watch that one afterwards as well in our videos here on YouTube. And then after that we're going to have an interactive Q a session. So if you have questions, make sure to drop them into the YouTube chat, be able to pull them and then moderate those from here. But again, glub, really excited to have you and thanks a lot for joining.
00:03:03.960 - 00:03:09.864, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for inviting, and thanks a lot for organizing. So I guess I'll jump right into, right?
00:03:09.902 - 00:03:12.490, Speaker B: Yeah, if you want to just jump right in, that'd be great.
00:03:16.140 - 00:03:34.544, Speaker A: Okay. My deck. Yeah, let me just collapse all the tabs. Yeah. Okay. So hello everyone. Really excited to see you.
00:03:34.544 - 00:04:16.136, Speaker A: Here. More excited to be answering your questions later on. So, as Keenan pointed out, I'm basically going to talk about. I'm glad from tsysystems MMs, and I'm going to talk about basically us running a chainlink node. I had a similar talk at the smartcon, so I tried to kind of put more content, like newer content into that. So basically I'll talk about, first of all, about training and anti systems MMs. So how does this work? What are we actually doing and how this came to be? Basically, then I'll talk about our broader, kind of from a macro standpoint, our infrastructure thesis.
00:04:16.136 - 00:04:38.500, Speaker A: So the way we look at the blockchain infrastructure, at node operation and staking, staking as a service and so on, so forth, and then I basically provide outlook on where we are going, like where I think the space is heading as well as then would be more than glad to answer all the questions. So just a few words about me. So who am I again, my role?
00:04:39.880 - 00:04:42.900, Speaker B: I think your mic has a little bit of an echo.
00:04:43.560 - 00:04:44.260, Speaker A: Okay.
00:04:44.410 - 00:04:46.170, Speaker B: Kind of going in and out.
00:04:49.420 - 00:04:50.696, Speaker A: Is it better now?
00:04:50.798 - 00:04:52.584, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds a lot better.
00:04:52.702 - 00:05:36.216, Speaker A: Okay, so my role is I'm a product owner at the assistance of Ms around all things, basically providing web three infrastructure, which includes running nodes, taking as a service and so on and so forth. I'm always trying to clarify the letter T, right? There's Deutsche telecom. People saying like, this looks like T Mobile. Yes, it does, because T Mobile is actually a subsidiary of Deutsche Telecom. So Deutsche Telecom is the big mother company, the Deutsche Telecom group, and we are the largest telecommunications company in Europe by revenue. And there are different subsidiaries. So T Mobile is one of those, as well as the T systems where I'm based.
00:05:36.216 - 00:06:39.320, Speaker A: More precisely, I'm based in blockchain solution center of tsysystems multimedia solutions. And basically there's a lot of companies, and they're all obviously interconnected and 100% subsidiaries. But just to make it clear, what I find pretty exciting about our blockchain solution center is that we are basically working very closely within the digital trust unit, which combines security, data privacy and blockchain together. So when you look at web three infrastructure, so running nodes, and especially oracle related business models where you provide data, I believe this is a very nice, basically match, because we can just not purely look at things from the blockchain, but we can just basically also look at all those business models from the very deep security standpoint as well as from the privacy standpoint. Okay. So basically, to wrap it up and some things have changed since I last talked at Smartquan. So where are we at today? We are currently running, we are live on 33 price feeds.
00:06:39.320 - 00:07:29.288, Speaker A: So last time I talked was five, I guess. So it's like more than what, 600% growth, which is nice since last time. Essentially what we do as a node operator, we are providing price data to the workers, mostly to the various decentralized applications, mostly currently utilized by DeFI applications. So I mean there are plenty of very cool companies utilizing the data we provide, like synthetics would be some of the, I guess more prominent examples of the DFI applications. So with this, basically, as I said, we help secure some of the value on the DFI application level. So currently 12.5 billion, which is still growing.
00:07:29.288 - 00:09:09.180, Speaker A: Most of that, as far as I remember, is powered by chaining with this basically, and I'll talk a little bit more about this later on. Where did this web three infrastructure provisioning as an enterprise actually came from? So when we look at the DeFi, at decentralized finance, it's a lot about, I mean it says basically in its name it has to be decentralized. So by default, or by definition, basically, it disintermediates a lot of players which are active in, let's say traditional finance. And I mean enterprises, I would put in the same bucket because enterprises have been basically working with mostly with very centralized business models. And now, as we see basically the space becoming more and more decentralized, as I believe it should, big companies are finding it way harder to basically get a very strong right to play on the application level of, and I mean DeFi would be the most prominent example of that, I guess. So at this point in time, I find it pretty hard to imagine a big enterprise basically developing its own DeFi application and basically attracting a lot of usage to that. So basically, given that, that there's limited try to play, what can we actually do? And basically this is where this infrastructure narrative, it came around, where we can say that, well actually enterprises have been very good in doing other things.
00:09:09.180 - 00:10:23.440, Speaker A: So like systems as a big IT service company has been very arguably famous or in Europe very prominent in terms of running and operating IT systems of other large companies, of running or providing a very secure IT service. But this is what, in case of chaining, basically in order to run a node, this is exactly what you need to optimize for. So you need to optimize for more or less traditional things like security, uptime, availability and so on and so forth. And that basically means that we can monetize the DeFi space. Like we can get our right to play in DeFi space as a large company, as an enterprise from the infrastructure standpoint, because by running chain in oracles, we are basically our, let's say future success or future revenue streams or whatever. Basically, the angle you look at it is dependent on the whole, in this case, defi space, basically growing and becoming more and more widespread and successful and so on, so forth. Because the more depths there will be, the more DeFi applications there will be.
00:10:23.440 - 00:11:23.024, Speaker A: The higher the demand for the data, the more value it secures, the more value will be put on actually secure price feeds on secure oracles. And that basically means that we will be basically participating in the growth of DeFi, but not from the use case standpoint, but from infrastructure standpoint. And I believe with that we kind of found the right to play in DeFi, and not just defi, but our staking. I will talk about this a little bit later. We are with this participating in generalized, so called generalized mining. So we are providing a certain IP service to a decentralized like Jay Brookmann invented. Kind of came up with this term because proof of work mining with bitcoin, it's basically taking some resources like the hardware, like the ASICs, and basically putting them to work for a decentralized network, contributing to the network.
00:11:23.024 - 00:13:04.596, Speaker A: What it wants in the case of bitcoin is security, immutability, and so on and so forth, and getting rewarded for doing so in a digital asset. So with Chainlink, you can kind of see the comparison, I guess, with the fact that you are providing, you're spinning up the node, you're making sure it's very secure, reliable, as well as you're also providing some data on top of it. And you make sure that basically your data cannot be corrupted, and so on and so forth. And that's the service you provide to a network, and that's how you get also, that's for what you are getting rewarded in case of chaining. So I believe we are the first enterprise in the world to kind of monetize, to basically work with a business model like this, where, I mean, there were some companies running blockchain infrastructure, like nodes, like bitcoin's, IBM, I think for private permission blockchains, I guess they do that quite a lot. But actually running public network infrastructure on a public blockchain network, as well as directly monetizing it via the native digital asset of that network, I believe this is something which we did, I guess I shouldn't say we are the first one, maybe I don't know about someone or something, but at least from the big companies we are, I would say the first one definitely. And what I also wanted to add is what I sometimes talk about is that there have been a lot of news about, a lot of news about microstrategy, right? Like buying bitcoin, holding bitcoin on their balance sheet and square.
00:13:04.596 - 00:13:44.048, Speaker A: And I think there was another one. But basically, actually our company is also, I think we are like, we are think 85 in standard SMP, like number 85 or something. But essentially by running these models we also hold assets on our balance sheet. In this case like Ethereum would be one example, right, chaining, but no one knows about this, which I sometimes find interesting. But I guess in the future as we basically scale up, I guess it will become a more prominent fact. So next stage is staking. Basically.
00:13:44.048 - 00:14:23.184, Speaker A: We are like everyone, I guess looking forward to proof of stake implementation as well as we are active on the staking business models, not just for chaining but for other networks. And we are going scale through those as well. Just some numbers. I don't think I will just give like the full numbers. I mean anyways, a lot of people, I guess on market link people can see our note, they can see basically the statistics about the earnings and so on and so forth. But what I can say at this point in time, this has been a profitable business model. So we do, as a corporate, we do have a lot of pressure on the business case side.
00:14:23.184 - 00:15:13.388, Speaker A: So we need to basically do business which is also making us money. We are not running like a proof of concept to see, to test things out, but we're actually running a viable business case and we want to scale it up. So basically we are doing it profitably like this. What I can say. So I've seen some committee, I guess that's what I didn't have too much time to talk about at the Smartcon summit. Basically the journey has been quite volatile, I would say, to get a business model to work like this, the business model like this, to work in a big company. I think this is also kind of obvious that bigger enterprises are not exactly famous for being too fast or too agile in terms of new business models and stuff.
00:15:13.388 - 00:15:47.092, Speaker A: But that infrastructure narrative of which I'm going to talk in the next part of the presentation I think really helped us to push this through and a lot of basically stakeholder management and education. So once you're kind of passionate about a project or about a thing, I think with a due amount of convincing and basically a lot of luck. Obviously you can push this through. So what we did, we raised internal funding for the project. Initially. It was not meant in the beginning. It was not supposed to be chaining, it was supposed to be another network.
00:15:47.092 - 00:16:27.664, Speaker A: But we still had that kind of generalized mining staking business model which we wanted to pursue. Basically it resulted in us. Basically we ended up with chaining for the first network we went live on. Obviously that involved a lot of protocol research and modeling, the business case, a lot of basically development and internal audits. Because the big company as again, I guess you can guess it needs a lot of approvals as well as making sure that the business models and the technology really works. So like on our end, on the infrastructure side of things, so the nodes and so on and so forth. It involved coming kind of talking about stakeholder management.
00:16:27.664 - 00:17:04.368, Speaker A: It involved making a lot of departments happy, which are the hardest to make happy in a big company. So I guess those could be like tax legal most of the time. But again, we had some pretty cool guys on board with this who supported us with getting basically this thing through the corporate door. So partnering, onboarding. So we are working with custodian and broker licensed in Germany. I'll talk about this in the next slide. Also, probably the very hard thing was to include all of the new processes which come with such a business model.
00:17:04.368 - 00:18:12.692, Speaker A: Like for example Baron chenic node. We need ether to basically feed the data into the network and we're getting link out of it, right? So basically having those assets, having those new processes adopted or somehow included in our ERP systems or something like this has been also a huge challenge for us, especially when the blockchain, you cannot send the invoice to a blockchain, right? So that led to quite some funny discussions internally. So obviously we launched our chaining node, I guess probably in the worst time to launch a chaining node. We launched it right into the fat campaign. So I guess people know which one I'm referring to as well as basically the DeFi was just taking up. So at some points the wave were just astronomical. So it posed itself some challenges for us internally on the risk management standpoint, obviously treasury management, as I said, we basically have to balance two digital assets.
00:18:12.692 - 00:19:06.244, Speaker A: So it's complicated enough when you have one digital asset which you need to somehow track and put in the systems and everything. But with chaining, it's basically that squared because we have costs in one asset and we have revenues in another asset. Both of them are volatile. As you can see from the discussion, from these discussions is that we basically turned ourselves into like a mini fund because basically we are dealing with two digital assets, which are, one is like cost and one is revenue. We are looking into hedging framework for how to basically make sure that in no way can our business case turn against us. I mean that would be like, I don't know, chaining price dumps and ether price like skyrockets or something like this. But that could be one scenario.
00:19:06.244 - 00:20:04.296, Speaker A: Obviously there are multiple ways to tackle it, not just hedging. There are a lot of, I would say, collaboration and coordination things which can be done to hedge against that. But from a pure financial standpoint, the prices are the ones you look at when you design hedging solutions. So we were talking with some banks, some banks, even the bigger ones, basically they have no idea what we are talking about. But with some smaller and more agile banks, I guess, who are more flexible in terms of offering some services around digital asset hedging and stuff, that's basically where we are currently looking at. So just how it works, I just wanted to very quickly show, I mean, I guess how did we structure dealing with digital assets in a compliant way for us in guess it's pretty straightforward. So we have a broker.
00:20:04.296 - 00:21:09.104, Speaker A: So in our cases, Bancho Shaik from Frankfurt and Finoa as a custody provider from Berlin, basically. And then there's the systems and then there's the chenic network, right? So basically there's definitely some movements of tokens between the custodian and the broker. I mean, understandably whenever you want to buy something or sell something, that's like basically custodian is the proxy and then basically our cost, right, as I said, is an ether. So we need to acquire ether to purchase ether, right? So through the custodian and the broker, we then kind of feed the data into the network. Okay, the chain link is at the wrong place, but we are like feeding the data in the network. And for that we are expanding the ether we bought, right, because we pay the transaction fee in the next stage. And for providing the data, what we earn is link tokens which we then in the next step will want, can or may or may not sell for back to euros to kind of COVID our expenses or something like this.
00:21:09.104 - 00:21:52.930, Speaker A: Because I mean, as a big company, as I pointed out, we still have a lot of these kind of business case considerations which we need to fulfill from the management standpoint. And I will also refer to how it can change in the future in the next slides. Yeah, blockchain infrastructure. So this is kind of talking about, I used this picture before. So kind of hearing all this, people might think, oh, they are like hyping or something. They are doing this business model because I don't know, there's a lot of money in the market or we are in whatever defi bubble or whatever, they're hyping it up. I would disagree with this.
00:21:52.930 - 00:22:59.668, Speaker A: I would disagree with this for multiple reasons. So what we published not so long ago was like the infrastructure, like web three blockchain infrastructure, where we argue, kind of try to explain from the enterprise standpoint how this thing work, maybe a correction just to be super correct. I published it from my personal account. So that might or might not be representative of the official view of the company, right? So it just shows just in order so that no one then comes to me and says, hey, you wrote this in your blog article, why did you write this like this? But in general, what I can say is that all of our team is basically aligned with that vision and with that kind of where we are going with this. So the way we look at this, I'll try to make it shorter because I want to keep some time for Q A. So why providing blockchain infrastructure? So we live where we live in the world of many chains. So there's not going to be a single chain basically doing everything.
00:22:59.668 - 00:23:45.440, Speaker A: So in each chain has its own purpose and its own goal. So bitcoin arguably, like peer to peer cash or digital gold, not going to go into that topic. And then chaining, for example, connecting, let's say off chain data in a reliable way with on chain smart contract, like bridging that basically physical and digital world gap, Ethereum coming up with like EVM whatever. And basically in order to fulfill that goal, all of these networks rely on a distributed infrastructure. So a lot of nodes. Otherwise it wouldn't be a blockchain, it would be a centralized system. So there needs to be a decent number of nodes which are run reliably and securely, right? In this case, it's nodes, validators and so on and so forth.
00:23:45.440 - 00:24:40.020, Speaker A: All of these blockchains basically are designed in such a way as to define good and bad behavior. So the good behavior is what gets you reward basically. And the bad behavior is what either doesn't get you a reward or gets you punished in terms of slashing. Right? And here out of this comes this generalized mining concept where you're looking at the network, you're looking what is good, what does the network considers to be good behavior or good service, good activity, and you are basically providing that and you try to minimize or completely avoid ever running into the bad behavior of the network. Many people refer to blockchains as incentive machines. That's basically what they are. They just program what is good, what is bad, and describe which rewards you get or which rewards you lose for either of those.
00:24:40.020 - 00:25:34.470, Speaker A: And that does kind of an economic, autonomous economic agents, or sometimes referred to as commons. Right? So blockchain can be also looked like a river where there is fish. And you look at the river, you see there's fish, and you decide, okay, how do I get that fish? And the laws of physics or whatever, I don't know, physics nature give you the way to get the fish out. You build a fishing stick and you go to the fish and you. Fish and blockchains network are in this sense kind of similar. Where there's the blockchain network, there are tokens in that network, there are rules of the game written in whatever white paper in the code, which defined as good and bad. And then you look at that and figure out, okay, so how do I get those rewards, what I need to do? And then you need to build a phishing stick, in this case like a node validator, and you build this in accordance to laws of physics, or in our case like laws of blockchain, whatever.
00:25:34.470 - 00:26:12.496, Speaker A: And basically that's the comparison, I think, which is pretty easy to kind of grasp. It's very hard for a new network to bootstrap infrastructure. Pretty straightforward. As I pointed out before, why we believe this to be our even core business is because in terms of providing secure infrastructure, there's not so much blockchain in it. It's more or less traditional DevOps security, which is like paramount, which is very important. The only thing different is the revenue you receive in digital assets. So once that is solved, basically you're good to go.
00:26:12.496 - 00:26:51.720, Speaker A: You're doing your daily business. So that's what we basically solved in order to allow us to fulfill these business models right very quickly. So why telcos? Because telco has been historically providing public network infrastructure. So from the phones they are building, like telphon towers, lines, et cetera, with Internet basically now say information at scale. There's Internet backbone as a cable service, so forth. If we look at web three, a blockchain is kind of the value on top of that. Like a layer, sorry, a layer on top of that, which is like the layer where you can freely move value around and transact and so on, so forth.
00:26:51.720 - 00:27:42.456, Speaker A: The public network infrastructure at that level takes form of nodes, validators, block producers, transcoders, bakers, and so on and so forth. So if we look at from as a telco into this and we say, yeah, this is the next public network. Our core businesses provide infrastructure to public network. So let's provide this if there's a business case. So that was pure infrastructure view. What the blockchain space makes it extremely exciting is about is that there's basically always a financial layer on top of anything. Like any, basically token economics, any infrastructure like a validator node, there's always a financial layer because there needs to be those incentives around running infrastructure, right? These incentives have to be baked in the protocol.
00:27:42.456 - 00:28:49.300, Speaker A: This cannot just be like a company paying you 100 whatever per month on a subscription basis to run a node. All this has to be on chain and written basically in the economics of the chain. So we know stake shift is happening. I guess not talk too much about this. So staking is like a means of active network participation and like non custodial yield generation, right? Basically staking allows people to actively participate in the network, to take on some different roles, participate in governance, do all sorts of jobs, to fulfill all sorts of jobs. I mean, in case of chaining or the proof of stake, that would mean that basically having secured a certain stake allows you to basically feed the data for the contracts which like securing a lot of value, for instance, right? So that's what enables a token holder of link, or I mean it would be same for Tezos, Cosmos, Polkadot, whatever. It would mean that that's the way for a token holder to participate in the network and secure the network.
00:28:49.300 - 00:29:59.608, Speaker A: Kind of trying to draw parallels to the normal people's world, right? The staking can be also looked at the form of election. So basically people are voting with tokens, they're electing their representative. Because staking, basically you have a choice how to run a known validator node or delegate to someone, stake with someone, vote with someone. Like all networks have different terminology, right? And here, basically it's a means for you to elect someone who is going to fulfill the service on your behalf. So just like, I mean on paper, right, politicians, they represent you and they fulfill your kind of, they do work on your behalf, right? At least that's how I guess it should be. And with staking, makes it very transparent on the code level, right? And a validator can also be looked as a bank because the validator is the one who enables a token holder to get exposure to the staking yields. Basically it's like going to a bank, putting your money in, and then they pay you some small interest.
00:29:59.608 - 00:31:06.028, Speaker A: Rate on the money because they use it for their purposes, right? They loan it out and stuff. They do some work with the money, right? So basically here it's the same, but it's non custodial, which is key, right? Because we are not getting the tokens, but we are just getting the right for the token and we are fulfilling some kind of work on your behalf as a token holder with that stake. So that leads to there being strong bottom up demand for secure infrastructure providers from investors like institutional as well as retail, as well as anyone who has to deal with proof of stake assets. And we can see like exchanges offering staking services. We can see like in the future banks will offer staking services, custodians integrate staking as a service providers and so on and so forth. And the key here is that for most of them this is not core business. And this is like super cool thing that basically for the bank, I guess let's take decentralized streaming network.
00:31:06.028 - 00:31:55.840, Speaker A: So you need to stake your LPT tokens with live peer orchestrator transcoder. And they do video transcoding. So the video transcoder fulfills a very specific technological like IT service, but it allows you to get yield. Like it's not core business of a bank to run to transcode videos, but this is a core business of the bank to provide yield. So there's this conflict and that means that the IT companies are now going to kind of eat into the bank's business, in my opinion, in the future. So once the crypto grows, so a lot of basically IT service companies will be way more positioned to, I mean, Defi is eating like traditional finance software is eating the world. And that's kind of also in that direction where it companies basically will be eating finance, in my opinion, slowly.
00:31:55.840 - 00:32:31.420, Speaker A: So I'll speed up a little bit. So scalable business models makes sense. It's not headcount driven, which is uncommon for a corporate. Usually corporates are used to having headcount driven business models like consulting, especially growing market size as well. Like the whole crypto market, the whole proof of stake market, especially Ethereum going to 8.0. The whole addressable market for staking and providing secure infrastructure is growing, microchaining is growing. So basically there have been some significant investments in blockchain infrastructure providers from leading VCs.
00:32:31.420 - 00:33:30.184, Speaker A: Sometimes if you run a staking service or your generous mining service, you're getting exposure to the assets at a lower cost basis. So basically you have a choice, either go to the exchange and put like, let's say you have 100K, you can go and buy a token like link for 100K. That's one option at the market price. Or you can potentially spin up the node and earn this and put this 100K into the secure node operation into securing like the fees and earn the link. And if you do it profitably, that by definition means that you're acquiring the token at a lower cost basis than if you were just to buy it on the market. And this often leads to situations where early staking service companies for new networks can earn the tokens at a cheaper cost basis than what VC is paid for, like in seed round, which is by itself a very powerful notion. I don't know, mechanic.
00:33:30.184 - 00:34:02.980, Speaker A: Right, I'll skip this one. I kind of talked about this as well as in the conference. So this is one which I like to talk about. There's this concept of network lifecycle, again, have to give credit to Bookman, he came up with this concept. Basically it says that any centralized network goes through a certain cycle. So there's an early stage where the assets are not liquid, they're maybe not yet live, the blockchain, the main net is not live. The assets have a very strong VC style character, they are not liquid.
00:34:02.980 - 00:34:37.940, Speaker A: And basically this is an early stage. Right. Then there's the mid stage where the main net is launched. And then there's this whole infrastructure needs to be bootstrapped with reliable node operators, professional infrastructure providers and so forth. Assets become liquid and it's all about governing the network. It's all about bootstrapping, providing all of those services which are needed for the network to basically get started, to get traction and so on and so forth. And then there's a late stage of the network where you have the public assets, the assets become more, let's say more liquid.
00:34:37.940 - 00:35:35.460, Speaker A: And it's really about building use cases on top of a network. And all of these stages are interconnected and like reinforcing another. Because if you're a VC but then you are also building the use cases, you are kind of contributing to the value accrual to your token. Because if you build a cool business case which creates all the value, and if the token economics are right, then you can expect some value basically accruing to the token and the same as mid stage. If you have invested in the early stage of the DC, you can use these tokens as enabler for you to fulfill those opportunities. Like in staking, right? You invest early and then this is your own stake which you have to put up as collateral. If you run a validator like some networks require you to put a self bond, like a tezos for instance, right? And I believe we as a corporate right now are more or less in the mid and late stages of this, right.
00:35:35.460 - 00:36:39.080, Speaker A: We want to run secure infrastructure and we potentially would want to build use case because we do have this big company and a lot of B, two C and stuff like this. But in the future, that's where I would want us to go is to capture all the three things, right? So that's a very simple thinking. Like if you're acquiring a digital asset at a lower cost basis than the VC would, or the lower cost basis than if you were just to buy it on the market, then why not just hold it? You are getting the asset anyways, then why would you sell it? You would want to keep onto the asset. If you believe in the network. If you believe, and I mean I guess that's the basic prerequisite to participate in network you believe in, right? Because otherwise it's a very short sighted kind of bet. Yeah, I guess I'll skip this quadrant. We can run vary data ourselves, like chaining would be the right quadrant at the top.
00:36:39.080 - 00:37:12.740, Speaker A: We are the ones running the node. We can also run it as a service on behalf of a bank custodian, et cetera. We can do this for public networks, but also we can kind of do this also for permissioned and private networks. The business case there is not as transparent because it's not on chain business case. Right. But still those are kind of the business models possible where we are going. So we are going to continue scaling our chaining project, we are going to add new networks, we are going to improve on our risk management and hedging and build up the platform for creating new nodes.
00:37:12.740 - 00:38:28.248, Speaker A: Basically is a part of our regional platform vision. I won't talk too much. Before starting this, we have a kind of a slightly broader vision of having this as a platform. We decided to start smaller, to have a build up the specific case and then potentially expand to offering this kind of more product size it. But yeah, that's maybe something which comes in short to midterm. Also, I guess we as a brand, especially when we talk a context of reliable infrastructure, I think the brand can be kind of trusted, right? We have a long experience of running secure infrastructure for big companies, for other big companies, not that much talk. I mean if we are providing infrastructure, I guess the whole package basically comes handy with the grant security certificates, compliance like regulatory, secure regulatory environments and so forth, as well as we are also actively looking into the ways to add value because especially in the public proof of stake space, there is a competition for staking the service providers.
00:38:28.248 - 00:39:00.952, Speaker A: There's this so called race to zero fees where the providers are very much competing on fees and so there have to be a lot of value added services which you provide in order to capture the bigger share of the market. So we believe there can be some and we believe we are active in some of those already. Yeah. Next step, support new layer ones and expanding from the financial standpoint. Right. So maybe hedging, maybe kind of moving into the whole lifecycle investing. Yeah.
00:39:00.952 - 00:39:39.284, Speaker A: So that's where we are. That's some funny screenshot that kind of summarizes it a bit. Right. What are the major benefits? That's definitely one, I guess. So basically being able to sit here and talk to you guys, I guess this is kind of also additional benefit which comes with dealing with innovation, like very kind of innovative business models. So for which I'm thankful for the team, for everyone basically who supported and helped to get this thing going. So feel free to reach out to me.
00:39:39.284 - 00:39:54.890, Speaker A: Feel free to read the infrastructure thesis which are published. Yeah. And I guess we are also on time quite well. So let's just jump into the Q A. Thanks a lot for your time.
00:39:55.340 - 00:40:18.130, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, thanks a lot for that glove. That was a great presentation. People are loving that last slide. Cool. Yeah. So I have a few questions here from the audience that I think the big one is, and you kind of touched upon this, where's the data come from that you guys are.
00:40:19.460 - 00:41:14.736, Speaker A: So that's, I guess I also saw the question somewhere on Twitter. So the data, we are basically taking some, we have multiple API providers which with whom we are working, we are constantly working on integrating new API providers. So all of those like premium subscriptions so we can make sure that we have a full, let's say transparency and data service. And I think the way, and what I like about Chainlink, the way it's expanding, you guys are trying to get rid of the single data API redundancy. So before some node operators were like working with one API, but now basically everyone has to integrate multiple. So basically to either make sure to switch them or in case there's some kind of huge deviation on one, so there are different ones you can basically switch onto to kind of minimize the potential negative impact on the whole network. So basically that's essentially what we are doing.
00:41:14.736 - 00:41:20.212, Speaker A: We are adding new APIs and we'll add more in the future, I guess. Cool.
00:41:20.266 - 00:42:00.988, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks a lot for that answer. Yeah, it's really interesting, this whole story, and you kind of talked about it on the slide, and then also with the analogy of phishing, but the story of everything that actually goes into this and t systems, you guys are like creating this blueprint almost for other people to kind of follow. And we're trailblazers really, in this. So it's really exciting to be working with you guys and definitely, definitely appreciate it. Going into yourself a little personally, too. Where do you see the future of Defi going? And we were kind of talking before with CBDCs in Europe and some banks that are in Europe kind of talking know, these are the futures.
00:42:00.988 - 00:42:02.690, Speaker B: How do you personally view.
00:42:06.100 - 00:43:16.084, Speaker A: Mean, arguably, that would be one of the first things to really get traction. I guess we also have to be kind of self reflective in saying that in 2017, everyone was saying ICOs are like the killer use case. Now everyone says DFI is killer use case. But I do think that there's much more substance in what we are seeing with DFI today than what we have seen with ICOs in 2017. I think the coolest things about DFI is really that it's composable, that you can really think that's what kind of enables those economies of network effects between each individual. Like, a lot of smart people are working on this thing and a lot of smart people are working on another thing. But then those two things can actually work with one another, which is unimaginable in the traditional world where you have a startup, and then they would see them as competitors or a big company would want like an IP or all sorts of considerations which kind of made it not possible before, but now with kind of Ethereum and maybe, I don't know, some other chains, we can see some other chain joining, kind of trying to join.
00:43:16.084 - 00:44:31.632, Speaker A: I mean, I guess people have different views on if they're actually joining or if they're just trying to join or making it look like they're trying to join, I don't know. But basically we can see that spread and pretty excited. I mean, each Defi application, like synthetics, whatever, it deserves its own kind of, whatever slot workshop to just fully kind of understand what it might mean in the future if this succeeds or if it gets traction, right? So pretty exciting space to be in. And from our standpoint, right, what we like from this infrastructure narrative, we are use case independent. We are not limiting ourselves to one application because one application, individual applications can fail. But if you are providing infrastructure to a broader ecosystem, basically, you are not really caring about individual companies failing or succeeding, but you just bet on the whole space, like a space as a whole growing. And I think that's the bet, which I guess we are definitely, I personally would be very comfortable making that the whole ecosystem would grow very cool.
00:44:31.686 - 00:44:48.710, Speaker B: Yeah. And I imagine so what was the culture shift like internally? Was everyone kind of already kind of considering cryptocurrencies and blockchain infrastructure as a path down, or did that take a lot of internal advocating on your part and team?
00:44:49.480 - 00:45:53.310, Speaker A: Yeah, so it depends what you look at. If you look at blockchain or blockchain infrastructure. So the blockchain definitely has been before I joined systems, I mean we had the big team of blockchain guys and from it, from tech to business finance guys, economists who were working in this space, and we built some projects, proof of concepts and use cases for larger companies like in automotive, in finance and so on and so forth. So that blockchain definitely, I can never say that blockchain just appeared or something, but that view of basically looking at the space, not that much from use case standpoint, but more from the infrastructure standpoint, from kind of trying to monetize all of the innovation which is happening in the public space and really monetize it with a digital asset, I think that's kind of the shift which happened. And again, we are thankful to many people who contributed to this. I'm glad this worked.
00:45:53.760 - 00:46:08.544, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, it's really exciting. And so I see one question here with this kind of staking model that you're thinking that will be KYC, correct. Anyone that kind of wants to be involved with what you're guess.
00:46:08.582 - 00:46:47.548, Speaker A: I guess it depends on the, so it depends on the staker profile. Right. So if you're working with custodian because it's their problem to do the KYC, it's not your problem anymore. If you work with one big client, be it VC foundation, et cetera, the same they akyc. Right. So it really depends what you are addressing and there are multiple ways how to limit the scope of people you are addressing. And I guess yes, that's definitely the concern would be from our lawyers is what happens if we cannot stop anyone using our service.
00:46:47.548 - 00:47:13.060, Speaker A: Right. If it's like staking as a service. But as I said, there are basically workarounds around that. For some protocols they are pretty simple. For some protocols I guess they would require a lot of workarounds. But because we are just starting, we didn't really face that problem right now. Or we try to proactively look at the opportunities which do not involve those sorts of considerations at the very beginning.
00:47:13.560 - 00:47:45.170, Speaker B: Got it? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that answer. And I think we got time for a couple more questions. Want to be respectful of your time. On one of your slides, you had what could be a model is other kind of enterprises and companies kind of like using your infrastructure through you. Are you seeing interest of other telecom companies or enterprises kind of wanting to jump in and either provide infrastructure or kind of do this same model as yourself?
00:47:47.380 - 00:48:11.256, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the short answer is yes. And the longer answer would be yes. And it depends. Right on the use case, it depends on the blockchain. It depends on who is the one reaching out. I guess what I see us doing right now is working. We have to, without basically being too precise, but basically we have to look where the token holders are.
00:48:11.256 - 00:48:26.300, Speaker A: And then if those token holders might not, might want to run their own infrastructure. But with knowing that we are the ones running the back end, basically. Cool. That would be the way to look at it.
00:48:26.450 - 00:48:53.380, Speaker B: Exciting times. Sweet. Yeah. I think that you covered most of the questions that we had and the audience had within the presentation. Is there anything else that you wanted to say that maybe anything else? Here's a good question. How do you prevent unauthorized reselling of t systems data yourselves?
00:48:55.580 - 00:49:38.596, Speaker A: Unauthorized reselling of t systems data. Right now we are not a data producer in our own right. So at this point in time, we are providing the digital asset prices. So we cannot produce the digital asset prices ourselves. That would be whatever a bank or clearinghouse, whatever, they would be the ones kind of producing the data which they can then sell. If we are thinking about some potential future use cases, like whatever supply chain. If we are running a supply chain use case and we have, then tsystems is the one running the supply chain or somehow integrating with the supply chain, then we would be the producers of the data.
00:49:38.596 - 00:50:03.470, Speaker A: And I guess then that's when we will have to think about that problem. Right now, that's definitely not a problem which can happen to us right now. Maybe it can happen in the future then. I'm not sure how, but that's actually an interesting question. Because if we are seeding the data on chain, then it's visible for everyone. But I guess then there are a lot of privacy. A lot of people are working on privacy and we'll see.
00:50:03.470 - 00:50:10.670, Speaker A: First people have to come to me with a very profitable, nice blockchain supply chain use case and then we can talk.
00:50:12.180 - 00:50:14.432, Speaker B: I'll make sure to read happens.
00:50:14.566 - 00:50:16.160, Speaker A: That's not really an issue.
00:50:16.310 - 00:50:27.312, Speaker B: Yeah, cool. Well again, Gleb, if people want to follow you on twitter, where should they go and how do they follow you? Progress.
00:50:27.456 - 00:51:17.168, Speaker A: Yes. So twitter is my personal one is hay gleb like hey, and my first name and for any t systems related, of course. Follow t systems mms, follow t Systems International, follow deutsche Telecom, whatever. All of those are basically entities we are affiliated or subsidiaries of. So if there will be some big information from the blockchain, you will definitely see it propagating basically upwards. And I would encourage to read the infrastructure thesis. We worked like this, took a long time to come to that and took a long time to kind of structure the thinking process behind this in such a way.
00:51:17.168 - 00:51:22.530, Speaker A: So any feedback for that more than welcome to implement, discuss, whatever.
00:51:23.060 - 00:51:44.390, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, really appreciate you coming on here, glubb. The community really enjoyed it and everyone who's viewing in, I'll make sure to drop those links in this afterwards and share the video. Also, stay tuned on the YouTube. We'll be coming back with another meetup with chain Guardians and you guys can help design the next characters here in a few minutes. So again, glub, really appreciate it and.
