00:00:00.410 - 00:00:24.458, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much for joining us today. Really appreciate and thanks, Jeff, for the introduction. It's a pleasure to be here with the advocates on stage. As you said, the community is really big and it's a pleasure for me to be on stage with four of them. Many of them of the other ones are here with me today and join us this weekend for the Smartcon. So really appreciate and yeah, maybe we can start with the introduction.
00:00:24.458 - 00:00:33.202, Speaker A: If can share a little bit more about who you are, where you're from and how you joined the web three industry. Maybe with you, Olivia.
00:00:33.266 - 00:00:50.460, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Happy to start. My name is Olivia. I am with Project Aventures, actually a venture capital firm, but I'm also a passionate community advocate. Since two years I'm leading the Berlin based chain link community.
00:00:51.470 - 00:00:59.230, Speaker C: My name is Alex Turley. I run a company called MDMA. It's a web three marketing agency and I'm also the community advocate for Atlanta.
00:00:59.570 - 00:01:09.330, Speaker D: Oh good. My name is Danielle, I'm from Brazil. I am the head of market of an NFT decks called tip and flip, known as Brazil content creator and a channeling community advocate.
00:01:09.750 - 00:01:16.440, Speaker E: My name is Rosh Patel. I'm a community advocate in London, based out of London. I've been an advocate for just over two years now.
00:01:17.770 - 00:01:34.202, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you so much. Appreciate and yeah, just maybe to have a quick introduction on how you discover web three, chain link and the advocates program. So maybe we start with you.
00:01:34.256 - 00:01:57.300, Speaker E: Sure. I found out about blockchain technology from the term dapps during the early Ethereum days. And the decentralization of apps is what sort of appealed to me. It obviously expanded into a broader range of how blockchains can work and function in real society. But that's sort of what first spikes my interest to read about it.
00:01:57.670 - 00:02:00.578, Speaker A: And when Chainlink appears in that, and.
00:02:00.584 - 00:02:24.780, Speaker E: Then Chainlink appeared when you understand that there is an oracle problem, and Chainlink seeks to solve an oracle problem of putting off chain data onto the blockchain. And that was always the other aspect of if data can't correctly and verifiably be put on chain and it's wrong at the source or in transmission, then you're at a sort of stopping point somewhere along the line.
00:02:25.630 - 00:02:27.334, Speaker A: Cool. What about you, Daniel?
00:02:27.382 - 00:02:44.182, Speaker D: Yeah, I started professionally, so an FT company hired me and at first I was like, oh my God, nFts, it doesn't make any sense. And I fell in love with this ecosystem. Now I'm here. Defi crazy. Oracle is crazy. And Chainlink. I was invited by Jeff at a conference.
00:02:44.182 - 00:02:53.570, Speaker D: He invited me to be a Chainlink advocate. I was already a huge fan of Chainlink, and I just said, yes, I'm totally in, and joined this amazing ecosystem.
00:02:54.710 - 00:03:20.086, Speaker C: I was serving at a bar on a lake and just making money hustling as a young kid. And then I was on Twitter and saw the cash tag and ignored it at first. And then my friend sent it to me again. I was like, all right, let me look into this. So I started researching and sort of going into the partnerships and what exactly Chainlink does, and I was like, okay, this is really cool. So then I started a podcast with two other friends and now four. We had Darb, who's another advocate, was our editor.
00:03:20.086 - 00:03:38.534, Speaker C: So that was amazing. And then Jamie, actually, the East coast events manager, invited me. He's like, do you want to run stuff in Atlanta? And at first, I was hesitant because I'm not the best public speaker, or at least wasn't at first. And I just took the leap of faith, said yes, and it's been history ever since. So that's how I got into chain.
00:03:38.602 - 00:03:50.566, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Something that is already great about when we talk about the community is this collaboration between people. So you were able to create something with some other people, Darby, and you're still working with them now, so that's awesome. Yeah.
00:03:50.588 - 00:04:09.706, Speaker C: Him and I, it's funny, we have like, this. I refer to anime. When you're on the hero's journey, the two characters are just like, building and building and building. And for the past two years, him and I have just built together and also built an amazing relationship. And I didn't even know him before I joined crypto, so it's really cool. The app gets. Program brings people together.
00:04:09.808 - 00:04:12.042, Speaker A: Awesome. Now, about you.
00:04:12.176 - 00:04:49.270, Speaker B: Yeah, for me, I think definitely discovered the whole space two to three years ago and came across Chainlink pretty soon when you start when to understand what all these different protocols are trying to do. So I was really fascinated with that. And by following Chainlink on Twitter, I came across the advocate program. So I feel like the program kind of found me rather than the other way around. It was great then to talk to Mark Romero, and he introduced me to the european community and was able to then start the community in Berlin.
00:04:49.770 - 00:05:25.426, Speaker A: Something that we can see already here on stage is that most of the time, the committee members start being advocates without the official title. They have an idea, they do it, and then we say, oh, we love what you do. Would you do that officially as an advocate? And, yeah, that's something really cool. And now if we talk about creating or building a community, I think it's something really important in Web three. We are really powerful, actually link with this community. What do you think about this important part of the community in the blockchain space?
00:05:25.608 - 00:06:04.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I can start. I mean, in Berlin, it's been really amazing, first of all, to see the community grow from, I don't know, very small amount. Now we have more than a thousand people. So it's been a really huge, tremendous, rewarding experience. And you get so many different profiles and developers and just enthusiasts and people who enrich the community from all sorts of different angles. Even if you come from Web two, you have new ideas about what web three can even improve. So there's this thing of the crowd gets smarter the more diverse it is.
00:06:04.574 - 00:06:18.340, Speaker B: So that's really, I think, what we do with the community building. So we bring in a lot of different knowledge and perspectives into the web three space. So I really enjoy that. And it's really rewarding also as an advocate to meet all these different people.
00:06:18.790 - 00:06:54.558, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. I think especially in Web three, communities are like the bread and butter of any brand, right? Like you can have good tech, you can have good marketing, but if nobody is constantly talking about your project or the tech, then it sort of falls off into the wayside. As we know, crypto is like goldfish attention span. Things just kind of come and go each day. So like building the community in Atlanta, it was really nice. Like the first event we had, 80 people showed up and so there was already people in Atlanta that were interested, but there was nowhere to host the event or no one was just hosting events. So that was nice to see.
00:06:54.558 - 00:07:14.600, Speaker C: And then even online communities, we sort of like reinvigorated the link marines with the L toads. So it's like a community link marine NFT project. And we focus on building education for the build program. So it's been really nice seeing everybody come together. And I don't think one person can be the community. It's obviously the group of.
00:07:15.770 - 00:07:19.126, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, pretty cool. It's all about education also.
00:07:19.228 - 00:07:19.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:19.532 - 00:07:34.122, Speaker D: What I'm trying to do is to bring all the Brazilians communities closer to Chainlink and explain what Chainlink really does, and they will be able also to explain Chainlink to the others. And in this way I can grow the community in Latin America or in Brazil in general.
00:07:34.256 - 00:08:02.200, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree. It's definitely about educating and informing and speaking to people. People always want to learn more and you can still learn from other people, even if you know more than them in different. So I've hosted events in London, and just turnouts in London have always been great, but you meet people, and you can have fantastic conversations and just learn loads and loads of information from people. So it's probably why a lot of people hear, as well, which is quite nice.
00:08:03.690 - 00:08:07.560, Speaker D: If it's all about community, just use the community. Just talk to people.
00:08:09.230 - 00:08:21.510, Speaker A: What are the main opportunities or challenges that you can see when we try to build a community in a decentralized industry, as here? I don't know. Maybe. Daniela?
00:08:21.590 - 00:08:31.230, Speaker D: Yeah. One challenge, and also opportunity is to be able to teach something that you have learned last week, for example. So that's the highest point for me.
00:08:31.380 - 00:08:56.920, Speaker C: I would say democracy, because definitely with a dow, it's like, there's so many people that have differing opinions, and that's, like, the point of it, is to hear them all and then come to a conclusion that makes the most sense. So that's probably been the most difficult part, is reading and trying to understand and relate to a ton of different people that want a certain project to go a certain way and what is the best avenue for that, and then sort of agreeing to that and voting on.
00:09:00.250 - 00:09:07.130, Speaker A: You. I know that, Danny, you're already involved in many other dows, too. I don't know if you want to share more about that.
00:09:07.280 - 00:09:08.406, Speaker D: About Daos.
00:09:08.598 - 00:09:09.642, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah.
00:09:09.776 - 00:09:40.438, Speaker D: What I'm trying to do in Brazil is, like, weekly tutorial spaces, and every week, I try to bring dows closer to us, and my approach is like, okay, do you think you don't have anything to do with chain link? I will show you that you do that you can build with chain link. So, yeah, I'm trying to bring dows closer and in other communities and some web two products and companies also, and talk about hackathons. That's my approach, because I think that everyone can build with chain link. You will find, at some point a collection with chain link, and maybe, I.
00:09:40.444 - 00:09:51.442, Speaker A: Don'T know if you want to share the main success that you had as a community advocate, something that you created for your community or something worldwide.
00:09:51.506 - 00:09:53.660, Speaker D: And my chainlink cupcakes, for sure.
00:09:54.190 - 00:09:55.478, Speaker A: The famous cupcakes.
00:09:55.494 - 00:09:56.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:56.510 - 00:09:57.782, Speaker A: And you, Olivia?
00:09:57.926 - 00:10:28.082, Speaker B: Yeah. I think last year, we hosted a lot of events. I think close to 1213 events, and we almost had. Half of the speakers were women. I was pretty cool turnout, actually. Like, in the end of the year, I started counting, and I was like, wow, it's like, maybe, like, 40% female speakers. And that was really cool results, I think, of a lot of sourcing work for really interesting speakers.
00:10:28.082 - 00:10:38.790, Speaker B: But of course, also a push to showcase that visibility and to give that transparency also to women in the space. So, yeah, that was a really cool kind of statistic.
00:10:39.770 - 00:11:15.170, Speaker C: I definitely think it would be sort of building the blockchain space in Atlanta. It was like I said, sort of siloed communities and chain link connects, chains connects oracles, dawns, et cetera. And so I thought of it as like, why don't we just take all these siloed communities and just start hosting events and sort of form. There was like four different groups, and now we just have one large group chat and we push each other's events sort of just like building the city up rather than building siloed communities. So that's been going good. And we're actually hosting an event next month called Web three ATL as a part of four or four down. I can go into that if you'd like, but it's very cool.
00:11:15.240 - 00:11:17.778, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you're in Atlanta, just join him.
00:11:17.944 - 00:11:20.726, Speaker C: If you're in Atlanta, hit me up. I'll let you know.
00:11:20.908 - 00:11:22.534, Speaker A: And the cupcakes. Anything else?
00:11:22.572 - 00:11:38.780, Speaker D: Yeah, the cupcakes for sure. Social media, local social media growth, weekly tutorial spaces. And when I taught chainlink to a master class in Brazil and to a hundred of teenagers, and they were very, very interested about Chainlink, so it was amazing.
00:11:40.350 - 00:12:08.340, Speaker E: I have helped host numerous meetups last year and also this year with a few other London advocates as well. Recently I've hosted a few Twitter spaces with some build projects related to that gaming. I haven't done anything like cupcakes, but no, most of what I do is sort of online and in person meetups. It's always nice to sort of meet people and speak to people.
00:12:09.590 - 00:12:13.398, Speaker A: You say that you had like 50% of the speakers that were women.
00:12:13.484 - 00:12:14.758, Speaker B: Like 40, yeah.
00:12:14.924 - 00:12:29.978, Speaker A: And what are the opportunities you see or what kind of strategy do you see in web three with this diversity? It's decentralized. I don't know if you saw other strategy by chain link or other project in web three.
00:12:30.064 - 00:12:32.366, Speaker B: You mean like what we can achieve with that?
00:12:32.468 - 00:12:33.818, Speaker A: Yeah. With this diversity?
00:12:33.914 - 00:13:28.734, Speaker B: Yeah. I think it's just a very strong sign towards women in general that there's this new industry, relatively, that can be now populated also with new ideas, with a lot of diversity. And if we come in early, then we can make space to bring in our ideas. And I'm very proud of that. And it's been so great to see also women that have been really in the industry for ten years since kind of everything became really big and there's a lot of knowledge also and a lot of mentorship for women among women in the web three space and especially in the Berlin web three community. Right. Chain link is one of the communities in Berlin, but we have also, there are other female web three communities, dows and so on.
00:13:28.734 - 00:14:12.378, Speaker B: And we kind of all talk to each other and make each other really strong. And I'm just very glad that with the chain link meetups, we're able to give a stage to these women. But also. Yeah, just like you said it the other day, right? Yeah. You can talk about diversity a lot, but the best thing for diversity is if you just have a very content driven talk or a very technical driven workshop by women, for women and so on, rather than always talking about diversity. Of course it's important, but the doing is much more important. So I'm really happy just to see so many women actually being so curious about the technology and making it, driving the diversity through it.
00:14:12.464 - 00:14:32.610, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree. I don't want to talk about how is to be a woman in web three. I want to be a woman in web three. You can ask me about oracles, data feeds, functions, everything. You know how to answer you. And what I'm doing right now is try to invite woman to talk about tech part. Yeah.
00:14:32.610 - 00:14:40.600, Speaker D: The most famous Twitter spaces in brazilian community is about the hackathon. And it was a girl explaining everything about the hackathon. It was amazing.
00:14:41.290 - 00:14:43.880, Speaker C: Was this launch is what was this?
00:14:46.570 - 00:14:55.260, Speaker D: No, no, not Solange, unfortunately. But she's awesome. She's amazing. It was Sabrina. She won the hackathon, the spring hackathon. It was awesome.
00:14:56.190 - 00:15:05.770, Speaker A: Maybe. What's your role as an advocate when we talk about educating people? Roche, maybe the educational part around blockchain.
00:15:05.930 - 00:15:35.320, Speaker E: Yeah, I think you need to first understand how technical minded someone is before you start talking to them about blockchain technology, smart contracts, et cetera, et cetera. But you could go down a path of beginner 101 and then I'm far from an expert, but we could more a technical conversation. So you can always progress a conversation with whoever you are, wherever you are, and different people. Yeah.
00:15:36.010 - 00:15:37.430, Speaker A: What about you, Alex?
00:15:38.250 - 00:15:39.622, Speaker C: Just like what I've done to help.
00:15:39.676 - 00:15:50.470, Speaker A: With education or more globally, how education is important for us as an advocate, how you can support the new joiners.
00:15:50.550 - 00:16:06.734, Speaker C: Yeah. So I hosted a CCIP event in Atlanta, like, last month, and it was for Georgia tech students. And so I was like, okay, computer science school. They'll know what blockchain is. They didn't know what metamass was they didn't know what the block explorer was. They didn't know what a blockchain was. And we were teaching about CCIP.
00:16:06.734 - 00:16:24.120, Speaker C: So I was like, oh, crap. So we're coming up with like a ten week course for all the students at Georgia Tech if they'd like to participate. It's basically beginner to. You can code your own Dapps, staking applications, use CCIP, et cetera. So that should be coming out soon. Cool.
00:16:25.050 - 00:16:54.914, Speaker B: Yeah, good. I'll take that as a input. I think in Germany we also partner more with educational. We want to partner more with educational institutions to host more workshops and just take a very pragmatic approach at education. But as you say, sometimes being in the industry so deeply, we can sometimes forget that a lot of people might not know some of the basics. So it's always important to kind of go back to that. So definitely, yeah.
00:16:54.914 - 00:16:56.100, Speaker B: Thanks for sharing that.
00:16:57.590 - 00:17:00.510, Speaker A: I remember that you said that you make some meetups in universities.
00:17:00.670 - 00:17:11.750, Speaker D: Oh, yes, in universities to 18 year old students. And they were very interested. It was amazing because it means that we are building the next generations of builders.
00:17:12.810 - 00:17:30.010, Speaker A: I think that's something that changed recently for the changling community, but we really want to reach the universities, students, young people, and to educate them from a professional way. So that's really cool. And, yeah, maybe for the next year. What are you the most excited about as an advocate?
00:17:31.150 - 00:17:51.154, Speaker B: I think the education really, I'm very much looking forward to meeting a lot of young people and kind of like hearing also what they're excited about. And then Chainlink has obviously launched a lot of great new features and products. So kind of like talking about the use cases of that will be pretty nice.
00:17:51.352 - 00:18:10.118, Speaker C: Yeah, I think coasting more events locally and just like getting the beginner knowledge up and then into intermediate and then also I used to create sort of like content about Chainlink services, so probably get back to that. I stopped for a while, but just more like deep dives from beginner to really understanding what the technology does.
00:18:10.284 - 00:18:21.134, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm excited to talk about the new products, to learn about the new product and also talk about the new product. That's what I want to do, because chain link unites two passions of mine, teaching and web.
00:18:21.172 - 00:18:43.940, Speaker E: Three, I'd like to host a few more in person meetups, but also online discussions, Twitter spaces, even like a YouTube live where you could have a demonstration purpose for specific people, specific elements and whatnot. That's what I'm sort of looking forward to doing next year. That should be quite fun.
00:18:44.390 - 00:18:49.826, Speaker A: You have a lot of work in the next few days, weeks, months. With every announcement from Kimali yesterday.
00:18:49.938 - 00:19:00.406, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely a lot of announcements. He was like, announcing data streams and then functions and then automation 2.0 is like, okay, it's okay. And then more and more.
00:19:00.588 - 00:19:02.630, Speaker C: It's like a 30 minutes talk. I just kept taking pictures.
00:19:02.710 - 00:19:03.162, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:19:03.216 - 00:19:04.300, Speaker B: It was so cool.
00:19:04.990 - 00:19:07.498, Speaker D: Yeah. The product team is just rocking it.
00:19:07.584 - 00:19:46.006, Speaker B: It's awesome. But I would also like to add, I'm looking forward to growing also the advocate team in Berlin. Right now we're like three, but we're just onboarding new advocates and hope to grow the team there because it is really about teamwork. Right. I think teamwork, if you're an advocate on your own, have really a lot of respect because it can be a lot of work, to be honest. I think it's really important for every advocate. If you're able to set up, like, a little team, if you can find other people from the community who want to, like, it just becomes a much more rewarding experience.
00:19:46.006 - 00:19:49.270, Speaker B: So I'm very much looking forward to that also.
00:19:49.340 - 00:20:04.398, Speaker A: Yeah, that's something crazy for the committee advocates. Is that for Rush and Euribia, you have a team, you are money advocates, but for most of them, they are alone in the city. You're just doing something crazy because you manage everything.
00:20:04.564 - 00:20:14.254, Speaker B: I mean, there's a lot of support from the community online. Right. It's not like you're completely alone, but it's like, of course, on the ground it's different, and that's crazy.
00:20:14.292 - 00:20:31.606, Speaker A: I think I was an advocate before joining the company, so I was one of them during two years, a few years ago. And I know that if you want to make a meetup, you have to do everything, so we support you, so checking up supports you, but you're the one on the ground, and you've done an amazing job. So that's huge.
00:20:31.708 - 00:20:53.242, Speaker C: Well, I want to say, yeah, Chainlink has been really great about that. Like I said, when Jamie sort of asked me if I wanted to lead Atlanta, I said yes, but he gave me all the resources and sort of just entrusted in me that I was going to do a good job and I did in the end. And I think that it's really cool that chain link is just there as sort of a support role.
00:20:53.306 - 00:20:53.486, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:53.508 - 00:21:02.080, Speaker C: Like, just go educate people. If you like the technology, which obviously, if you're an advocate, you do. And, yeah, so just thank you to chainlink for everything.
00:21:02.530 - 00:21:11.170, Speaker A: And, yeah, maybe what advice would you give to someone that want to be more involved in web three as an advocate or maybe just as a community member.
00:21:11.910 - 00:21:12.802, Speaker D: Yeah, sure.
00:21:12.936 - 00:21:48.654, Speaker B: So I would definitely find a local community and try to find people who have the same interests. And if there's no local community, start like a little meetup. Like, even if you just meet for some drinks or so and start talking about the topic. I think one of the first meetups I went to, also in Berlin, was from a dao, and then they had questions printed out and it was like, what's your favorite coin? What's your favorite blockchain? I was like, this is so adorable, but these kind of things that happen, and it was a very memorable experience for me. So, yeah, definitely.
00:21:48.772 - 00:21:51.626, Speaker C: I would say plus one, get involved.
00:21:51.818 - 00:22:05.026, Speaker D: We're here every single day talking about community, the part of community. So use this community like, text the people, send direct messages and talk. Go to events and start to talk with people. Definitely.
00:22:05.128 - 00:22:18.486, Speaker E: I say do it. Just go for it. Even if you're shy, quiet, attend. Because you will meet one or two people and you'll just have a common interest because that's the reason why you've gone to the place in the first place. So just do it. Go.
00:22:18.668 - 00:22:35.422, Speaker C: I would also add that it opens so many doors that you don't think could be opened. So it's like if you want a job in the space or even think that you want a job in the space, just take the first step. It's kind of like anxious of nerve wracking at first, but you meet a lot of cool people and you build relationships and learn a lot.
00:22:35.556 - 00:22:46.700, Speaker A: And content is available for free. You can have access to everything. So just do it. Just do it and join us as an advocate. Perfect. Thank you so much for joining us.
