00:00:08.810 - 00:00:42.342, Speaker A: Awesome. All right, let's get started on our lesson three. Remember, everything is in the GitHub repository and we could scroll down, hit lesson three and see all the code here. I'm building up this repo as I film, so underneath this lesson three is going to be a lot more information than just the code here. All of our code samples end with FFC, which means freecodecamp. So if you see a GitHub repo that ends with FFC, know that that repository is associated with this course. I'm going to do a quick high level walkthrough of what we're gonna be building in this lesson.
00:00:42.342 - 00:01:11.262, Speaker A: So you don't need a code right now. Just sit back, watch and enjoy. In this lesson we're actually going to expand to having three different contracts. Let's say we want to be able to deploy simple storage contracts from a contract itself. Yes, contracts can indeed deploy contracts. We are going to create a contract called storagefactory Sol that's going to be able to deploy and interact with other contracts itself. So what we could do is we could go deploy this to a Javascript VM.
00:01:11.262 - 00:01:52.798, Speaker A: We're going to choose storage factory and we're going to go ahead and hit deploy. In our contract down below we have a number of different functions. Our top function is this function called create simple storage contract, which we can click, and it'll actually create a simple storage contract for us. Then we can go ahead and interact with it at a next zero, we'll save a favorite number of one. Now if we hit SF get zero, we get one back and we can see the address of the simple storage contract that we just deployed. Additionally, we're going to learn about a number of solidity features such as importing inheritance and so much more. So let's go ahead and jump in.
00:01:52.798 - 00:01:59.530, Speaker A: And remember all the code is available here from the GitHub repository, so be sure to refer back to these contracts if you get lost.
