00:00:14.490 - 00:01:49.946, Speaker A: With Chainlink proof of reserves we leverage on Chainlink's decentralized oracle network that has been secured tens of billions of dollars in DeFi to verify assets collateralization, be it off chain collaterals like for stablecoins or tokenized rwas where reserves are mainly deposited on various banks or third party custodians. Also proof of reserves for on chain collaterals which you can verify and check wrap assets on the destination chain against where the native assets are locked on the source chain. So here the diagram illustrates how the Chainlink decentralized Oracle network monitors the third party auditor or the third party attestors reported asset vault values and submit these reserve answers to the proof of reserve feed contract on chain. So here, whenever there is a change on the vault's reserve values, the oracle nodes observe that change, come to the consensus within the dawn, create a report and then submit the latest reserve answer to the proof of reserve feed on chain. And who are the stakeholders which can benefit from proof of reserve? Firstly, it's the token issuers themselves. We're able to provide greater transparency of solvency, proving that sufficient assets or collaterals are fully backing their token. Second, the DeFi apps and developers can integrate proof reserve fee as verification logic checks or circuit breaker in smart contracts to prevent minting or even prevent accepting these unbacked or undercollateralized tokens.
00:01:49.946 - 00:02:54.210, Speaker A: And third, definitely defi participants, the community, the token holders having a boost of confidence and peace of mind knowing that these tokens are sufficiently backed. So in short projects developers can leverage proof of reserve as an added layer of security, increase transparency for their stakeholders, boost community trust and finally gaining a competitive edge. Being a leader in the space to integrate proof of reserve transparency versus opaqueness, which would you choose? But hello and welcome to Chainlink tech talk session. My name is Joshua Ching and I'm a solutions architect here at Chainlink Labs. Today we're very fortunate to have Benjamin Stani from Matrixport and we are going to talk about proof of reserve and the implementation on STBT token. Benjamin, welcome. Perhaps you could give us a quick round introduction of what you're working on at Matrix Port and also Matrixdoc and the background of the companies and what is it aiming to solve?
00:02:55.510 - 00:03:45.490, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Thank you for having me here, Joshua, and thanks for the introduction. We're excited of what's been built there on chain link labs as a partner. Matrix Port is one of the largest digital asset service provider, spun out as a standoff from Bitmain in 2019, very deeply and rooted into the ecosystem in Asia but generally, like on the crypto side and global scale. And Matrix Doc is our real world asset brand that has been launched at the beginning of the year where we're focusing on tokenizing real world assets and have launched the first product which is called short term treasury bill token STBT, which relies on daily proof of reserves in a fully bankruptcy remote fashion.
00:03:47.130 - 00:04:08.250, Speaker A: Right. RWA tokenization has been an increasing focus in the blockchain industry with BCG, JP Morgan. A couple more reports mentioned a total addressable market of in the trillions of dollars in the coming years. And what do you think that is and why? Is it something you decided to pursue and perhaps some benefits do you see in tokenized rwas?
00:04:10.030 - 00:05:09.834, Speaker B: Yeah, so I've mentioned like the first RWA that we've been working on is this tokenized treasury bill token. And what we've seen over the past 18 months is a drastic divergence between on chain yields in DFI and the risk free rate that you can generate off chain. If you think back, like beginning of last year, you're able to generate easily double digits in Defi while treasury rates were close to zero. And then Luna happened and we had a couple of other collapses in the ecosystem. And basically if you go back to end of four Q last year where crypto yields have collapsed and us government paid you close to four and a half percent, now that has continued to increase. But a lot of the crypto players were jealousy eyeing the risk free rate off chain. And so that has brought the demand for bringing that rate into a liquid form on chain.
00:05:09.834 - 00:05:23.490, Speaker B: And obviously rwas have two major benefits. They're bringing increased transparency, they're bringing 24/7 liquidity as well as cheaper transaction costs. And they're also allowing the origination of new type of assets.
00:05:23.830 - 00:06:04.930, Speaker A: Yeah, indeed. I think tokenization of RWA brings a lot of major benefits when it comes to you mentioned just now. Increased transparency, 24/7 liquidity, lower transaction cost overall. I think this is also resonated in the recent DUI research where investors are mostly now interested to invest on tokenized private funds, securities, fixed income products like T bills, bonds and et cetera. And I know Matrixdop has launched tokenized t bills called STBT. Short term treasury bill token. Can you give us an overview of the process of STBT? How is it different from the other tokenized assets out there? Maybe perhaps also some key unique features and benefits of STBT?
00:06:05.910 - 00:06:49.040, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Absolutely. Happy to give you a quick brief overview of STBT. Let me share my slides here. So STBT, as we mentioned before, the yield that us government is now paying on short term debt, which is generally considered as the risk free rate in traditional finance, has exceeded 5%. And so that brought that demand for the risk free rate into the Defi ecosystem on chain. And while stablecoin issues have added t bills to their protocols, obviously there's an advantage if you can replicate t bills directly in a tokenized form.
00:06:49.040 - 00:08:05.538, Speaker B: The way that this works at Matrix Dork I mentioned before in February 2013, Matrix Dork has launched real world assets and the first token that we've created was SDBT. SDBT stands for short term treasury bill and exclusively deploys reserve assets in short term us treasury securities with six month maturity or less or reverse repo or cash. And the token itself is launched as an ERC 1400 standard token that is only offered to accredited investors and gives them that type of exposure. Now what do we offer here is basically a diversification for stablecoins. STBT is designed to allow stablecoin holders to access this risk free rate via t bills in a completely transparent on chain way. The fee rate is very competitive. What you can see here, for example, we've compared it to two of the other major tbill providers here, and SDBT is we're only charging ten basis points annualized off the yield.
00:08:05.538 - 00:09:12.282, Speaker B: Then there's the intermediate fee of the assets that the custodian is charging, and then there's a redemption fee in case you want to redeem this token one to one with stablecoins. At the moment, most of the major stable coins are supported for minting STBT, and as long as you pass the KYC and restrictions to be on the whitelist, then you'd be able to hold STBT. There's a web free connection as well, which is the minter contract, and that allows for anyone permissionlessly to interact with the minter contract and send stablecoins to the smart contract address and then mint STBT from there. The other thing that I should mention here is that obviously because this is on chain security and audits are very important. So there's been two security audit firms, blocksac and Celec, that have audited both the STBT contract as well as the minter contract, right?
00:09:12.336 - 00:09:49.340, Speaker A: Yeah, speaking of security, STBT token has integrated proof of reserve verification checks into the minting logics, so ensuring that STBT supply on chain is always equal or less than what the proof of reserve reports otherwise minting will revert. So making sure that STBT is sufficiently backed and fully collateralized off chain and very excited as well to provide this additional security to STBT token. And Ben, maybe you could also share a little bit more, like why is it important to have proof of reserve and how does it benefit STBT? Maybe in terms of security transparency or holders confidence as such?
00:09:50.270 - 00:11:01.840, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So we've made sure that STBT goes full length in terms of transparency, and for that we are very happy to be partnering with Chainlink and proof of reserves where in real time users can verify any point in time that the underlying assets held in the bank accounts backing STBT are equal or higher than the outstanding number of tokens. And what that means is that there's no need to trust the issuer because this is enshrined in the smart contract logic, as you mentioned before, that there can be never more STBT than what the proof of reserve attestations is. And what we've also done in terms of reducing counterparty risk is set this all up in a bankruptcy remote orphan entity. This is an SPv structure where basically the assets are backed by securities and there's no counterparty risk involved with matrix port, the parent company.
00:11:02.390 - 00:11:11.860, Speaker A: Awesome. And maybe one question, what does STBT enable for DeFi ecosystem and its use cases in the coming future?
00:11:13.750 - 00:12:32.010, Speaker B: So STBT is really seen as a building block. You can think of it as an on chain t bill token, a way that you can get that risk free rate on chain. And so that means it's very seamless and cost efficient on and off ramp because matrix stock can provide the minting and redemption both YOTC as well as the smart contract, the minter contract that I was showing before, it's an on chain treasury tool that allows anybody that currently holds stablecoins, which natively can't generate any yield, to generate that risk free rate, while having a similar underlying risk profile, which is us government securities, which is generally considered as the risk free rate. And so this is attractive for DeFi projects, for Dow treasuries, for protocol treasuries, for vcs that have raised and haven't deployed or high net worth that want to have assets on chain. And it's also an interesting primitive on the DeFi side for yield farming funds because they can provide STBT related liquidity to on chain pools and then earn liquidity rewards by providing that on chain liquidity.
00:12:32.170 - 00:12:39.040, Speaker A: One more question, are you considering or the team is considering offering more this kind of tokenized rwas in the.
00:12:41.410 - 00:13:18.940, Speaker B: I mean, the short answer is matrix doc has been created as our RWA unit and we plan to launch multiple products in that area. Real world assets is something that we are very passionate about and believe is the future. But at the moment I think the major focus for us is this treasury token. We are looking at 100 billion of market cap in just fiat backed stablecoins out there that are currently generating zero interest natively. And so there's still a long way just for this one product to take off.
00:13:19.950 - 00:13:34.690, Speaker A: It's a huge market out there and this is only. We are just about to start in this kind of industry for the developers out there. Do you have any recommendations for the developers out there building tokenized assets?
00:13:36.390 - 00:14:39.030, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think if you're developing tokenized real world assets, generally the first thought process you should be going through is like who are you actually targeting this token to? Can they buy it? As I mentioned, SDBT is going through a KYC process. So it's only for accredited investors, which means it's a KYC token, it's a permission token. And that's the first thing that you have to think about whether what you're going to do with your RWA token will be considered as a security in most jurisdictions. And then the second question that you should be focusing on is what's the strength of having this on chain? Yeah, obviously you can have better transparency is what we're showcasing here. You can better liquidity and ease of transfer. So these should be your main selling points and should be pain points for your users that you're trying to solve with your token.
00:14:39.530 - 00:15:00.490, Speaker A: Exactly. I think the strengths of having on chain is transparency, greater access to liquidity and the ease of transfer. That's very true. And your prediction, what are your predictions for the future of tokenized rwas? Is there anything you're particularly excited about with the future of this industry?
00:15:02.190 - 00:15:36.040, Speaker B: Yeah, so I said it before. I think the part that I'm very excited about is just the treasury side of things. For example, we have over 100 billion of fiat backed stablecoins and we've only got a few hundred million of tokenized t bills in the market. So that's a tiny fraction. But if you look at the size of the US government securities t bills, that's over 11 trillion. Right. So that's more than ten x of the entire crypto market cap.
00:15:36.040 - 00:15:49.498, Speaker B: And that's just one type of off chain security. Right. If you're looking then at other asset classes, you can get an idea of the scope and potential of what we're talking about here.
00:15:49.664 - 00:16:05.170, Speaker A: Billions of dollars that we're talking about just now from the reports that we get as well and from the online articles that we read as well. That's a lot to come. Where can viewers like us learn more about Matrixdop and how can we get involved?
00:16:06.310 - 00:16:15.214, Speaker B: Yeah, the best way is to go to the Matrix doc website ww matrixdoc.com and then follow us on Twitter or our accounts.
00:16:15.262 - 00:16:17.010, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect, perfect.
00:16:17.080 - 00:16:20.360, Speaker B: Or of course, feel free to reach out for me as nice.
00:16:21.370 - 00:16:39.560, Speaker A: Benjamin, thank you so much for your time today. And thank you for explaining STBT in more detail and also the implementation of pool reserves and how it can tremendously help to increase adoption. We look forward to together having greater collaborations. And thank you everyone for watching this tech talk. Have a great day.
00:16:40.290 - 00:16:40.700, Speaker B: Thank you.
