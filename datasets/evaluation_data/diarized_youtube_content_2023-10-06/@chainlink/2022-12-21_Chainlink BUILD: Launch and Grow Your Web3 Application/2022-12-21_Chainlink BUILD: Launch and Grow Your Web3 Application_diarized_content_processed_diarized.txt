00:00:02.250 - 00:01:12.910, Speaker A: Chainlink build is made to allow these early stage teams, these kind of pre revenue to mid stage teams, to grow and get access to the best chainlink services by allocating a significant portion of their total token supply to paying for the highest quality of Chainlink services. So what this is meant to do is, regardless of where the market is, it could be up, could be down, could be in the middle. We fundamentally believe in web three and we believe in web three applications and DFI and all of these systems. And our goal is to enable all of these developers to build the next generation of systems. And in pursuit of this goal, we're making it easier and easier for different groups at different stages of their development to pay. So the rates that been seeing for the build program so far are somewhere in the three to 5% range of the total token supply of folks that are in the build program and going on to use these chain link services. So the build program is there to enable the growth of the next generation of Defi and other apps by allowing them to pay in a resource they abundantly have, namely their total token supply.
