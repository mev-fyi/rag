00:00:05.290 - 00:00:19.774, Speaker A: This panel is fundamentally about nfts and community. When I got involved in the NFT space, started really learning about them. I didn't get it. I wasn't going to make it at first. More volume. Can we get a little higher volume, please? Thank you. Yeah, see, keep it up.
00:00:19.774 - 00:00:35.174, Speaker A: I like that. I appreciate that. But once I actually started participating, I got nfts. I joined discords. I started meeting people and learning projects. I realized community is this fundamental part of this technology. So we wanted to have a panel about that.
00:00:35.174 - 00:01:06.434, Speaker A: Can you hear in back? Still low. We need higher. Good crowd. One of the things I noticed, again, just to repeat, was that community is fundamental. And the diversity of community in this space is actually really fascinating in the front row alone. We've got entrepreneurs, we've got professors, we've got musicians, we've got artists, we've got everybody, like, spanning the spectrum. It's been really fascinating to watch and be a part of.
00:01:06.434 - 00:01:25.062, Speaker A: So let's have a panel. Let's talk about community, what that brings to projects. Before we get into the meat for our panelists, I want you guys to go ahead and get started. We're saving the seat right next to me for Merlin. He's running late, so he'll come in first. One word. Describe your community in one word.
00:01:25.062 - 00:01:26.834, Speaker A: Adam from untamed elephants.
00:01:26.962 - 00:01:27.982, Speaker B: Charitable.
00:01:28.146 - 00:01:31.980, Speaker A: Charitable. Fantastic. Crystal. One word.
00:01:34.980 - 00:01:36.204, Speaker C: Superheroes.
00:01:36.332 - 00:01:39.756, Speaker A: Superheroes. Adam from ether cards.
00:01:39.948 - 00:01:40.892, Speaker D: Supportive.
00:01:41.036 - 00:01:47.940, Speaker A: Supportive. Adam, let's start. Ether cards. Adams. We have two. Adams. I'll make sure to distinguish why.
00:01:47.940 - 00:01:50.660, Speaker A: Supportive. Reflect a little bit. What's your community about?
00:01:50.810 - 00:02:35.200, Speaker D: Yeah, so the community is very engaged with the ether cards projects and any projects that ethercards becomes involved in. It's really amazing that they jumped on early with the presale, with the project earlier this year. And every project that ethercards works on and launches with a partner receives an incredible amount of support, both with purchasing and collecting the projects, but also in non monetary ways. Just getting the word out and being supportive through discord and through Twitter and information sharing and educating potential members of those other communities.
00:02:35.360 - 00:02:36.304, Speaker A: Awesome. Crystal.
00:02:36.352 - 00:02:37.024, Speaker D: Superheroes.
00:02:37.072 - 00:02:37.956, Speaker A: Was that your word?
00:02:38.058 - 00:02:38.468, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:38.554 - 00:02:42.244, Speaker A: All right. Why? Superheroes, like, reflect. What is your community about?
00:02:42.362 - 00:02:43.476, Speaker C: Everyone in our community.
00:02:43.578 - 00:02:44.404, Speaker A: A little closer, please.
00:02:44.442 - 00:03:10.264, Speaker C: Everyone in our community is super multi talented and supportive. So not only are they out there creating and bringing something to the table, we have lawyers, we have artists, we have marketing people, and these are all just community members that kind of the project. And they're all like, we have lawyers that are like, I have this side project. I want to get into art I want to learn how to build nfts. Can you teach me? And then an artist will come and teach them, or like, a tech person will come teach them. So much support, so much information sharing. It's amazing.
00:03:10.264 - 00:03:14.032, Speaker C: And just seeing that every day is like, what really pulled me into the space.
00:03:14.086 - 00:03:26.252, Speaker A: I was like, wow, fantastic. Untamed. Adam, we agree. That's a pretty cool name. You're charitable, was your word. Talk about your community a little bit. Why are charitable?
00:03:26.316 - 00:03:44.890, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I'm here to repamed elephants. We're the OG charity driven NFT community. So our audience loves artists and nfts, but we're also on a mission to save the elephants in both Africa and Sri Lanka. So in our discord, we talk less about price and more about what we can do to help elephants using new technology.
00:03:45.420 - 00:04:01.868, Speaker A: Fantastic. We're here because nfts have had this crazy rise in web three over the past year and far beyond web three now. We're clearly seeing that so many industries are involved. Adam, ether. Adam, what's led to this rise? Why are people excited about this movement in this moment?
00:04:01.954 - 00:04:51.180, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's a couple of things. One, I think everyone wants to belong to a tribe, right? And so this is another opportunity to find a tribe. Belong to a tribe. But probably just as equally important, or maybe more important, is it also offers this opportunity to have a one to one connection with the creator. So the creator of the collection, the creator of the idea, the creator of the art that's on the NFTs, it's a wonderful opportunity where if you want to find a tribe around a specific, whether it's a charitable project like untamed with elephants, or it's an artist project, or it's a project that is with an NBA rookie of the year, you can find those projects, you can find those tribes, you can join them, and you can have this great community and participate and learn and share your knowledge with others.
00:04:51.250 - 00:05:08.884, Speaker A: Right. There's the social belonging component that really helps, but then there's also this, like the secondary market makes there's value possible, and that's not for every project, but for many projects. That's clearly what leads to the rise and the excitement. Crystal, what sort of things are you seeing in terms of why do you think this has taken off so much right now?
00:05:09.002 - 00:05:31.692, Speaker C: I think it gives everyone an opportunity to get in on something that's so new and fun and because anybody can do it that has a laptop and there's so much information and everyone is so friendly and helpful. You can get into it without much experience, and you could be not doing it yesterday, and then next week be like one of the top artists. All you have to do is bring an idea.
00:05:31.826 - 00:05:50.290, Speaker A: So it's an opportunity space for creativity, which, I mean, there's been some of those opportunity spaces. They've been built on gated platforms or walled platforms. And it feels like because of composability, there's just this opportunity for openness and expansion. Experience untamed. Adam, do you have reflections on this?
00:05:51.860 - 00:06:17.848, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in the NFT world, one of the greatest things is when we welcome someone to the herd. I mean, you post on Twitter and suddenly you get 100 likes and 100 people sharing their elephant nfTs. And when we joined forces with Chainlink, with our integration, we got the same link. Marine welcome. We got 100 meme photos welcoming us to the Chainlink family, too. So that kind of welcome in this kind of socially isolated Covid era just resonates a lot.
00:06:17.934 - 00:06:51.940, Speaker A: I wonder about that, the timing with Defi and Covid and NFTs, people are looking for more social connection. Here it is. And it's not just social connection, but also value and also this creative space. And you've got to spend your time doing something. It's like a perfect storm of events, almost untamed. Adam, I'm going to go back to you. So for know, one of these elements of NFTs pfps, a lot of what comes into what makes people excited about them is the prestige that comes along with them being first, being early, high value, finding something rare, super rare.
00:06:51.940 - 00:07:04.196, Speaker A: You guys are taking this charitable approach as well. I'm curious, how does charity manifest as prestige in your community? Is that something you guys talk about? Is that, like, a goal of yours? How does that manifest?
00:07:04.308 - 00:07:35.620, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So a lot of people use our elephant pfps on their twitter and social media, and we're trying to make our elephant project reflective of our charity values, so that when people are flexing with their twitter profile, people are like, oh, this is a person who loves elephants, who wants to contribute, who wants to do more. So in the traditional, non digital world, you see people wearing their charity, like wristbands and charity t shirts. So we want to make elephants the premier charity PFP.
00:07:36.280 - 00:08:07.816, Speaker A: Yeah, when I've donated to, what should I call them? They're not digital, they're analog charities. Can we do that? I don't think that quite fits, but still, analog charities of the past, I do like having that identifier, that moniker. It doesn't have to be a lot, but like a little. Thank you. I'm going to show a little something for what that is. So to move that to a digital world makes a lot of sense in terms of charitable donations. Crystal, what do you guys see? You have a little bit of a different structure with your NFt because it's dynamic.
00:08:07.816 - 00:08:21.312, Speaker A: First talk a little bit about it just so people kind of understand the context. It's a bit different. It changes over time given specific scenarios. And then how is that different in terms of prestige and pfps and things like that?
00:08:21.446 - 00:09:14.210, Speaker C: Yeah, so mine is interesting and the concept behind it is really ownership and it's sort of playing with ideas of ownership. My image is one of the first. It's usually like the top three, but most of the time it's the first result for face when you google it on images. And that image was taken backstage at a fashion show and I wasn't paid for it. It was just put up on a blog and somehow made it to the top of Google. And it's just been there for years. And when I saw that NFTs were just like the capabilities with it, I knew I wanted to play with this concept that I've been thinking, like, how can I do an art piece around this? Because I'm an artist and I talked to a friend and he brought me to a curse share and we created this dynamic NFT that's like a 3d model of my face that changes emotions with the price trends of Ethereum and our project.
00:09:14.210 - 00:09:27.620, Speaker C: In order to bid on the piece, which was the one of one, we had a ticket sale. And anyone that has a ticket then is going to be able to be the first access to a new platform we're building to help other artists create dynamic NFTs the same way that I created mine.
00:09:27.780 - 00:09:49.836, Speaker A: It's this total interesting confluence of intellectual property and digital ownership and rights and releases and dynamic nfts. It's really fun. It's very wild. Interesting program. Ether Adam, let's talk about Lamella Balls project for a little bit. Lamella Balls is doing NFT with ether cards. That's a different type of prestige.
00:09:49.836 - 00:09:54.370, Speaker A: It's like fans, it's real fandom and a fan experience. How does that play into.
00:09:56.900 - 00:10:39.804, Speaker D: Really, this is a really fun project that Ethercar has worked on. So Lamello Ball was the NBA Rookie of the year last year. We started working with his team before the NBA Rookie of the year award was announced. And so we set it up in a way where if Lamello won the rookie of the year award, then the NFTs would change dynamically based on winning the award. So that was the first thing. So by doing that, the strategy behind that was, again to offer the community an opportunity to have continuous engagement with Lamello. So whether you're a collector or a basketball fan of Lamello, you were invested in interacting with the NFT and interacting with Lamello's career, basically.
00:10:39.804 - 00:11:21.448, Speaker D: And we tried to take it a little bit farther for the next iteration, and we thought about, all right, well, how can LaMelo's career be put on the blockchain, right? So what we did was working with Chainlink. We now have Lamello's stats from all of his games are now on the back of his NFT. So his NFT are two sides. The front side is this really great design with this really talented, very talented artist. And then on the backside are his stats. So the owners of these NFTs will have a historical record of Lamello's performance starting this year. His first game was October 20.
00:11:21.448 - 00:12:14.540, Speaker D: So from October 20, this year forward, all of his stats will be on the NFT provided by the chain link and the Oracle. But by doing that, that creates this continuous engagement. And then to take it a step further, Lamello and his team are building in drops of tickets and merchandise and both digital airdrops and physical redemptions. So again, it creates this continuous engagement opportunity for fans and collectors. And I think that speaks to this opportunity to create this micro economy around fandom. Right? Because now you can continuously engage with your fans if you're someone like Lamello. Or back to my original point, if you are a collector or a fan, you have this opportunity to have a one to one relationship with the creator.
00:12:14.540 - 00:12:25.150, Speaker D: In this case, it's Lamello. And you can do that by owning the NFT, which, to your point, also has this secondary market value attached to it.
00:12:25.620 - 00:12:34.364, Speaker A: So we were talking a little bit. We started chatting about this and then stopped because I was like, I want to talk about this during the panel because I heard about another artist who's doing a fan connection.
00:12:34.412 - 00:12:34.684, Speaker B: Drops.
00:12:34.732 - 00:13:19.200, Speaker A: I just talked to them today and drops to their fans. You buy an NFT, you get special access to all sorts of interesting things. And we're reflecting this is essentially creating a new industry community manager as a fan experience, because these airdrops, I mean, they're NFTs. They last for as long as the blockchain lasts. So it's building this brand for a super long term, building a relationship with a set of fans for the lifetime of the person and longer their estate, which is like this miniature cottage industry now that has not only that's existed before, but it has not been democratized like this before. And that's really, really fascinating to think about. These small teams that are going to end up running stuff for well known people and brands and intellectual properties for a very long time.
00:13:19.270 - 00:13:43.220, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a big opportunity. And additionally, it's great for the creator or that celebrity or whoever that individual is, because they can own and control the monetization around it. There's no ads being sold on the side of their intellectual property unless they want it to be. There's nothing else sold by a third party unless they want it to be. But they're truly owning that relationship and also controlling the monetization.
00:13:43.380 - 00:13:47.868, Speaker A: Crystal, did you have a reflection on that? I saw you going for the mic, so I wanted to make sure I.
00:13:47.874 - 00:13:48.780, Speaker C: Was just moving it around.
00:13:48.850 - 00:14:19.156, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Just checking with you and another sort of interesting data point there. When there are secondary markets, they benefit primary markets. When there's active community around secondary markets that the primary market may not have a hold of, those always benefit primary markets. It's excitement, it's activity, its potential, and then that reflects back not always in direct value, but in indirect value and costs. So from an economic standpoint, that's great for large existing ips as well. Sorry, I got excited on a tangent there.
00:14:19.156 - 00:14:42.590, Speaker A: I told them I have questions, but I may drift off on them and get excited as well. Adam, do you have ideas about this is really interesting for a charity too, about community length and the dedication about how are you going to have a community for a very long term invested in this charity? Not just financially invested, but interested and conceptually, how do you guys plan for that?
00:14:42.960 - 00:15:30.012, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So a lot of NFT projects donate one time to a charity and call it a day with untamed elephants. We're brainstorming with three different elephant charities on how can we use the NFT as kind of a membership card to work in their infrastructure? Because the elephant charity world is huge. It's gigantic, and they're throwing events all over the world and they have a lot of interesting people involved. So how can we tie into what they're doing? And the first thing we're doing is one of our nonprofits is leading an elephant rescue mission in Sri Lanka in February for elephant NFT holders. So they'll be able to come and join us and the CEO of the nonprofit will be taking us around the country and we're going to try to subsidize travel. So depending on response and everything.
00:15:30.012 - 00:15:36.012, Speaker B: We can't have everyone join, but we'll maybe use Chainlink as the random number.
00:15:36.066 - 00:15:55.288, Speaker A: Generator to pick a topic that I've seen. I haven't actually seen discussion of this. I feel this. So this is dear to me. I love NFT projects. I am one person with a limited amount of time and energy. I don't know how to dedicate my time to NFT projects.
00:15:55.288 - 00:16:06.928, Speaker A: I'm seeing a couple of nods as well. What do we do? Here's a question for the industry. What do we do? We depend on active communities to participate, to be involved. But I got a job, man.
00:16:06.954 - 00:16:07.850, Speaker D: I got kids.
00:16:09.260 - 00:16:17.320, Speaker A: How do you judge that? How do you encourage people to make it worth their while and solicit that in some ways you guys are competing, right? We're competing for attention.
00:16:17.980 - 00:16:19.276, Speaker D: So first of all, how do you.
00:16:19.298 - 00:16:24.264, Speaker A: Approach that or how projects approach that? We'll just start right to left from audience, Adam.
00:16:24.312 - 00:17:33.308, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So for those of you who don't know, ethercards has traits that are on chain, utility and functionality traits that are on chain that can be added to new NFT projects that are built, or even existing NFT projects that have already been built. And so by having these traits added to NFts after they launch or when they launch, that provides an opportunity to provide those benefits on a random and or non regular basis that can keep the community somewhat engaged, looking forward to the drop of those trades. So if you're like us, where we have jobs, we have kids, we're busy, I can scan my discord announcements for those rare but valuable benefits and traits that are going to be added to the NFTs because that's the small amount of time that I have to be engaged. And so we kind of look at it from that layer and then everything on top of that is just great, right? And everything on top of that generally comes from the community itself around educating and communicating internally.
00:17:33.484 - 00:17:41.076, Speaker A: Discord notification bot. Somebody invent it. Help me manage my discord noties. Yeah. All right. We're getting some love on that one. All right.
00:17:41.076 - 00:18:01.244, Speaker A: There's a hackathon project for you right there. Sorry, I was just checking to see if somebody else is here. No, Crystal, how do you split up your attention? How do we think about this and give the projects the attention they deserve? I love these projects. I want them to succeed. I can't give my everything.
00:18:01.442 - 00:18:41.176, Speaker C: It's so hard, especially because, discord, you turn all the notifications off, but you still get maybe the announcements, and then it's like ten announcements a day from one project. I feel like one thing for me, because it's so much between Twitter and Discord and all the groups. I feel like keeping your project clean and concise and not like spamming your community because these are your people and if you keep spamming them, they're going to ignore you at some point. So I think keeping your announcements really concise and not like announcing announcements, just like saying, here's the thing, here's the information you need. Don't tease them. Give them the info and don't make them jump through hoops. Take care of your people.
00:18:41.358 - 00:18:58.984, Speaker A: I want to believe, I want to believe in humans. But like spam, you still get spam emails for a reason as it works on enough percentage of people that spam is effective enough. It's like cost benefit analysis enough. So, yeah, I want that so bad. I don't know. I don't know what to do about it. Adam.
00:18:58.984 - 00:18:59.816, Speaker A: Go ahead, Crystal.
00:18:59.848 - 00:19:09.292, Speaker C: I was just going to say, I personally, if I'm in a project and it's like a week in, and I look at the announcements and I thought I was keeping up, and then there's like 50 that I missed, I usually am just like, okay, this project is not for me.
00:19:09.346 - 00:19:22.660, Speaker A: It's hard. You guys approach that. What do people do? You want people to come in, be donors, be helpful, be proud of that, but also participate in other things in the space. So how do you balance that? Or how do you encourage your community to balance that?
00:19:22.810 - 00:20:00.930, Speaker B: Yeah, we haven't figured it out either. And I'm an NFT investor as well, and I struggle with the same things you guys do. So one thing I'll say is that when building a community, you build it one person at a time. So there's a lot of fly by night NFT people who just chase after what's hot, but those guys will all disappear. The next hype thing that comes up. But the people who, one on one, you can connect with and build up as a new core community over time, I think that strengthens. So whether it's someone who comes in with a tech support question that you can help them one on one with, or just asking someone about who the person is behind their.
00:20:02.900 - 00:20:26.276, Speaker A: Great. A lot of you may not know exactly how Chainlink relates to all of this. I'm not going to give the whole spiel. Chainlink is infrastructure that helps many NFT and defi projects and all sorts of projects get data from off chain on chain. We're kind of the pipes beneath the surface of the street if you want to learn more, there's plenty of information about that online or talk to any of us as well. I got Mike up front. He's a chain link geek.
00:20:26.276 - 00:20:51.364, Speaker A: He knows everything about it, so you can talk to him too. But that's why we're here. That's why we're hosting this event as well. Are any of you thinking about getting into launching an NFT project? Do we have people who are considering that a little bit? Some of the folks, yeah, I got some nods, some subtle stuff. So here's a question. Where do these people begin? Because I thought about that too, like, oh, it's easy. Crystal just said it's easy.
00:20:51.364 - 00:21:01.332, Speaker A: I can get spun up and then I kind of get stuck. And again, I'm busy, so I drop it because I'm just like that. But where do people start? Adam, I'll start with think.
00:21:01.386 - 00:21:20.808, Speaker D: I think there's two things. I think there's the non technical and the technical. So I recommend, and I've had many of these conversations with people who are interested in starting projects. I always recommend non technical first. So work on building a community first. That community can be discord. It can be twitter.
00:21:20.808 - 00:22:27.804, Speaker D: A good example is I had a call with a project from some people in Paris who are looking at starting an NFT project around wooden japanese prints. So it looks amazing what their idea and their concepts are and what I told them is what I would recommend, which is spend time on building a community first and have a solid community of others who are authentically interested in the concept and in the project. And then from there you can start to grow the community and then move over to the technical because at that time, then you can build it and you can launch the actual NFT and you have this wave of support and it'll be easier to identify others who are authentically connected to the project. Because at the end of the day, the projects that I see that work really well are these very authentic projects. So the people behind them are very authentic behind it. They believe in it and they bring in back to this tribe and this one to one, they bring in the tribe of others who also believe in it and also want to be part of that tribe and also want to have a one to one connection with the creators.
00:22:27.932 - 00:22:29.372, Speaker A: Crystal, your thoughts?
00:22:29.516 - 00:22:53.284, Speaker C: Pretty much exactly that. And I'm actually doing exactly that right now. I'm gearing up for my next project, which is going to be a super strange painting project. And I've built a community and I'm just like slowly just talking to people supporting them. I had this great couple of guys come in from NFT Gamer TV, and they are so supportive and awesome. They invited me to their server. They taught me about a whole new chain that I don't know about and gave me some NFTs.
00:22:53.284 - 00:22:59.370, Speaker C: I'm like, if you just interact with people and you'll find the resources out there.
00:22:59.740 - 00:23:03.080, Speaker A: Join communities. Build your own community and join communities. Adam.
00:23:03.240 - 00:23:31.844, Speaker B: Yeah, that's all great advice. On the technical side, things are going to get much easier soon. It'll be like, push a button and launch an NFT collection. There's a lot of platforms I've seen out there for that. On the community side, I'd say to make a project that if there's a bear market, you'll still be passionate about and love and go through. Because the worst thing is to put all your energy into something for a quick payday. And then there's a bear market, and then you have to abandon it.
00:23:31.844 - 00:23:39.688, Speaker B: So pick something that no matter what happens to the NFT market, you'll still be passionate about and you can rally people around and keep pushing through.
00:23:39.774 - 00:23:54.188, Speaker A: Great. Here is super practical advice for me. Join NFT projects. Join their discords. See what they do with their community. Pay attention and participate. And you find one that's like, I don't want to do that.
00:23:54.188 - 00:24:14.784, Speaker A: Either it's too much work or I don't like the vibe. Or find one that says, oh, man, this is a community that's really valuable. And then just think about it. What are they doing that makes that valuable? And they're going to have community members that contribute in interesting ways. And so it's going to be like, well, yeah, if I have an amazing community, an amazing community will happen. But you got to think through some of that. Join a bunch, see how they're different.
00:24:14.784 - 00:24:38.452, Speaker A: That doesn't mean you have to buy nfts for everything, but you do need to join communities and see, what are these groups talking about? How does it work? What do people care about? There's the practical advice. Join discord servers. As I say, I get too many discord notifications. How's that for advice for you there? We're going to wrap this up. Merlin, thoughts? No. Okay. There is Amy.
00:24:38.452 - 00:24:49.644, Speaker A: Is it Amy from Metasaurus? Who's here? She's in back somewhere. She's got bright pink hair. I'm jealous of the colored hair movement. I'm going to do blue. I'm doing chain link blue. Oh, he's coming. Yeah.
00:24:49.644 - 00:24:55.756, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. See, we got blue here. He's coming. He missed it. We're done. Come on, Merlin. He's running late.
00:24:55.756 - 00:25:11.952, Speaker A: All right, so I'll set Merlin up for this. We'll give him. Make sure you know who he is so you can ask him questions. Merlin is Dr. DMT, founder of Metasaurs. Any roars in the house, he'll be here as well. Very passionate community, a very active discord.
00:25:11.952 - 00:25:48.576, Speaker A: So you can get his input. If you're looking to find some communities to join as well, you can join all of these communities as well. Discord servers, telegrams, all of that. Before we let up, though, last night, I was hanging out with a guy and he saw someone at the conference he wanted to talk to, and he was like, I don't know what to say. I just want to talk to that guy, but I don't know what to say. So this is an opportunity. Okay, panelists, what is a question that you want to get? Somebody's going to walk up to you after this and say, what's your favorite color? No, but like a good question.
00:25:48.576 - 00:26:04.672, Speaker A: What's a good question? So this is a question you can ask us up here. This question. I sprung this on you guys. Sorry. Surprise. But this is a question that the audience or people around the conference can ask you after this or later as we socialize. What's a question that you want to get? Anybody volunteer?
00:26:04.736 - 00:26:10.248, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say, ask me what's the most valuable part of this conference so far?
00:26:10.334 - 00:26:21.436, Speaker A: What's the most valuable part of this conference? Ask Adam. Ether. Adam. Adam Bauer from ether cards. That's the question you can ask him. If you got a question, write that down. You're set up.
00:26:21.436 - 00:26:25.980, Speaker A: I set you up. I hooked you up. That's a copy paste. Control v crystal.
00:26:26.640 - 00:26:32.556, Speaker C: What do you love about nfts? Everybody's passionate. Or like, what's your passion project in nfts?
00:26:32.748 - 00:26:45.100, Speaker A: What do you love about nfts? What's your passion project? You can ask Crystal from a cursed share that question to get that conversation started. Control C. Control v. Adam.
00:26:45.180 - 00:26:54.070, Speaker B: Yeah. My favorite question I get is I don't know anything about nfts. I want to buy my first one, and I love elephants. Can you kind of help me get started?
00:26:57.560 - 00:27:15.624, Speaker A: That works? No, but you love nfts and how to get started. He's a great guy to talk to. So, Adam from untamed elephants. Me, I actually didn't think about an answer to this question. So how about, would you like a cup of tea? My voice is killing me. No, just come and say hi to me. I will drive conversation.
00:27:15.624 - 00:27:24.652, Speaker A: That's kind of what I do, so don't worry about a question for me. But now you've got questions. Control C, control v. For all of you. Thank you all so much for joining this panel. Round of applause for our panelists. Thank you.
00:27:24.706 - 00:27:25.550, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:27:29.520 - 00:27:42.850, Speaker A: And we've got some more time. How long do we have this place, Josh? We got plenty of time. So there's more pizza in the back, there's more drinks. Start socializing. The best parts of these conferences are the conversations that happen, so please have them with each other as well. Thank you very much.
