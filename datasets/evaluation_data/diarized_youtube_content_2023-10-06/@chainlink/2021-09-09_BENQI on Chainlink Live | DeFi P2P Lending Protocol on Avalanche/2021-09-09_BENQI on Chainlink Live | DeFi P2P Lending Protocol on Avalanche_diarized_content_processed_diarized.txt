00:00:00.330 - 00:00:29.094, Speaker A: So here we go on Chainlink Live. Welcome to Chainlink Live. My name is Andy Boy and I'm here with JD Gagnon from Benki Finance. Benki's on Avalanche. And recently, well, not recently, now, a couple weeks ago, I guess that's still recently launched with Chainlink price oracles for their lending protocol. JD, happy to have you on. Why don't give us just a little primer? What is banky? What's kind of special about the project?
00:00:29.292 - 00:01:05.038, Speaker B: Yeah, little Primer is kind of hard. I could probably go on for 20 minutes, but banky is an algorithmic liquidity and money market on avalanche lending protocol, probably the easiest way to characterize what we do. It's just the first iteration of kind of the vision of Benki as a platform. But it was critical, obviously, for avalanche defi avalanche ecosystem to have kind of that foundational piece. So that was where we started. Let's give users and participants the opportunity to lend and borrow. Let's give other Defi protocols the opportunity to build strategies surrounding banky pools.
00:01:05.038 - 00:01:13.986, Speaker B: And here we are. Obviously things have gone fairly well, lots of work still ahead of us, but we're overwhelmed with the support we've had so far.
00:01:14.088 - 00:01:51.546, Speaker A: Yeah, for avalanche, for a long time, the network was alive. It's been live for over a year. And there was defi on the c chain for quite a while. But it was all dexes, pretty much different forms of decentralized exchanges because they're amms, which basically means you don't need an oracle. They make the prices themselves, just the way those smart contracts balance. But a lot of those next level of defi functionalities, lending and stablecoins and all that sort of stuff, really, we're waiting for price oracles. And so once the Chainlink price oracles launched, we saw Banky come right out of the gates and it looked like people kind of poured into banky.
00:01:51.546 - 00:02:02.820, Speaker A: And we're really excited about that. Can you describe the type of enthusiasm? Did you know beforehand, before that day of launch, how much enthusiasm there was going to be?
00:02:04.070 - 00:02:39.034, Speaker B: We're our own worst critics always, right? So we build these projects and you get excited and you have this vision and you build it out and you get to launch and you've tested everything and, you know, there's always little bugs and stuff when you launch and you get thousands and thousands of people playing around with something. But we were confident. We knew it was going to work. We knew it was secure. We had lots of audits, we had chainlink. We had worked very closely with venture partners and strategic partners in different areas of the world. So we knew we were going to have pretty good coverage.
00:02:39.034 - 00:03:05.830, Speaker B: But if somebody would have asked me to bet on 2 billion TvL, I wouldn't have taken the bet. I would have lost for sure. I would have probably bet everything against it and expected to lose or expected to never get there. And so it was pretty overwhelming. It was exciting. Obviously, it's a new paradigm, really, for avalanche. It's a new paradigm for us as a lending protocol.
00:03:05.830 - 00:03:33.280, Speaker B: That's a lot of responsibility. Obviously, we planned for that. We knew it would get there, maybe just not as quick. But yeah, it was a lot of anticipation. I mean, we worked very closely with you guys. It was critical to us to have proper oracle support. Security is number one, really, in any DeFi protocol, but especially in DeFi primitives and lending, there's just so much value at risk in terms of security.
00:03:33.280 - 00:03:43.220, Speaker B: People put a lot of capital, a lot of assets in these protocols. So we need to be 100% sure that we don't have vectors unaccounted for.
00:03:43.830 - 00:04:30.254, Speaker A: I was wondering about that because is there even extra pressure? Because you're one of the first, if not the first core, really, lending protocol on this c chain, on avalanche, that has a fair amount of hype and people come in and so if there's a security problem with y'all, there's security problem for, that's terrible for the whole ecosystem on avalanche. So there's that extra security and pressure, and then there's this additional pressure of just having that many funds and $2 billion. That's a crazy amount of money. If I could just say that's just not an amount that registers in most people. How do you guys deal with that as a team and as an individual? I'm just curious, how do you think about that and how do you stay focused?
00:04:30.382 - 00:05:22.850, Speaker B: Yeah, we take it seriously. Obviously, we didn't get into the D five primitives business and space with the intention of not having this type of responsibility. We came out publicly from day one. It would be pretty easy for people to figure out who we are, where we live, what we do, and we did that on purpose. The longer term vision of Benki, which I'm sure we'll talk about a little bit later on, but it is heavily focused on the regulatory environment and focused on compliance and Kyc AML. And in order to achieve those visions, which we'll talk, security history is paramount. And I mean, we had a lot of support from avalabs because again, being the first kind of larger platform to come out.
00:05:22.850 - 00:06:00.350, Speaker B: If there were issues, obviously it would reflect poorly on the ecosystem. And we have a lot of people that are waiting in the ecosystem for things to finally happen. And here we are, all the pieces are in place. So we had a lot of help or a lot of extra I's a lot of support making sure that we had all of the t's crossed and I's dotted. We went the extra mile with security. We've engaged Halborn on an ongoing relationship, so it's not just a one time smart contract audit. They look at everything like absolutely everything from a security standpoint, how our operational security happens.
00:06:00.350 - 00:06:20.546, Speaker B: All of our emails, everything that we do personally as a team also is looked at and consulted on from Halburn we have know that we're working with also from a security standpoint, gauntlet from a risk mitigation perspective. And of course, Chainlink.
00:06:20.658 - 00:06:53.918, Speaker A: I got a good friend who's head of security at a major crypto project, and audits are not a one time thing. I think that's a misconception. Audit is a process that does not end. This is a real value and it's other people's value. And you don't just stop and be like, okay, we're good now check the box. It's this constant thing, and sometimes it takes a little while to get used to that if you're unaccustomed. I came from academia, and so my security was like, make sure you don't share your key card and don't let people into your email.
00:06:53.918 - 00:07:12.322, Speaker A: That was pretty much it. But there's real different levels of security and for very good reason as well. So taking that can be a little bit of a step. But speaking of using Chainlink as a protocol and working with Chainlink Labs, how does Chainlink work? Tell the people, what do Chainlink oracles.
00:07:12.386 - 00:07:47.266, Speaker B: Do in, I mean, one of the most important pieces of banky is, of course, your collateralization rates. So you have to give collateral, obviously, and deposit money into the protocol. And when you give collateral and deposit money, you get yield on that asset. And if you so choose, you can then use that as collateral and borrow against it. And there's a lot of reasons that you might want to do that in Defi, we won't get into those today. But when you borrow the asset, the collateral, there's a ratio. There's a ratio that has to be considered to keep the platform solvent in a decentralized way.
00:07:47.266 - 00:08:56.838, Speaker B: And so in order to do that, the value of your collateral has to be tracked very closely and Chainlink obviously provides price feeds for our major assets so that we can be confident as a platform, the users, the other users of the platform can be confident that those price feeds are being accurately managed so that we know that if liquidations have to happen, they happen with clarity and certainty. I think what Chainlink does, obviously, that really adds a lot of value, is there's a bunch of redundancy built into Chainlink's decentralized infrastructure. The feeds come from multiple sources and they're adequately balanced and so on. So that we're not seeing the potential for somebody to maliciously move price on one exchange, have that do something detrimental to our protocol and cause chaos. And that's where you see flash loan exploits on lots of different platforms in the past. Having appropriate Chain link feeds is a very solid protective measure against that. Nothing is a sure thing in crypto, of course, especially when the stakes are so high.
00:08:56.838 - 00:09:06.330, Speaker B: If somebody finds a way in, there's a lot of assets accessible. But Chainlink has helped us to at least secure up that risk.
00:09:06.750 - 00:09:10.830, Speaker A: Know, are there anybody doing flash loans on avalanche right now?
00:09:10.980 - 00:09:46.178, Speaker B: Yeah, there is access to flash loans. Probably not in the size and scope that you would need to move markets again. Chainlink has done a lot of work, I think, and you know this as well as anybody, obviously, Andy, but Chainlink has done a lot of work, I think, to shore up the quality of the feeds, the amount of volume that's required to have a chainlink feed now, trading volume, the dispersion of trading platforms, there has to be a certain amount of them to be supported by Chainlink.
00:09:46.194 - 00:10:12.334, Speaker A: As a token, there's redundancies and decentralization from exchanges to data providers, to node operators, and to the clients, too. There's like three levels of clients. In case anything happens to go wrong in the actual code, there's a ton of redundancy built in there. I wasn't sure about the flash loan. I hadn't heard about that development on avalanche yet. So just curious about that. We're starting to get a couple of questions as well.
00:10:12.334 - 00:10:22.510, Speaker A: People are starting to ask about assets like, what can people use as collateral on banky? But first, let's clear something up. How do you pronounce banky?
00:10:22.670 - 00:10:26.550, Speaker B: Okay, so we call it. I call it banky.
00:10:27.290 - 00:10:31.014, Speaker A: Okay, that's it. That's the official. It's banky. Okay, good.
00:10:31.132 - 00:11:04.446, Speaker B: And the token is the chi token, which is probably, you wouldn't make that connection immediately, but it's the chi token. And so if you're in, you know, there's some asian influence, of course, in this. We named it Banki on purpose. And if you look at in Mandarin, it would be Banchi. I probably said it wrong. My teammates and colleagues are going to give me a hard time after. But that's the asian pronunciation, the mandarin pronunciation of Benki.
00:11:04.446 - 00:11:22.434, Speaker B: And it does have some meaning, interest over time in essentially the rough translation. And so it was a nod to our asian community also. It sounds cool. It's a really neat name, the Qi token. Yeah, Benki.
00:11:22.482 - 00:11:36.714, Speaker A: But the token, see, that's maybe that's where people were getting mixed up on my chats. There's arguing about all this conversation. I was thinking it was Qi, like, internal power, like Tai Chi, like that sort of thing as well. So I don't know if that's part.
00:11:36.752 - 00:11:42.398, Speaker B: Of your thing, but there's a lot of ways we can build really fun stories around it over time.
00:11:42.564 - 00:11:57.730, Speaker A: All right, let the lore build. So, back to this. What are some of the collateral that people can use now or that you're thinking about in the future? And a follow up. How do you make decisions about what collateral you want to include?
00:11:58.470 - 00:12:47.310, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. So, right now, you can have Avox as collateral. You can have wrapped bitcoin, wrapped ethereum wrapped chainlink. You can have USDC and Dai, and you can also deposit USDT tether, but you cannot use that as collateral on the platform. And then your follow up question, how do we pick assets? There's quite a few things. Obviously, risk to the platform, risk to the users, is the single largest priority here. Part of the reason we partnered with Gauntlet is Gauntlet does a ton of ecosystem related modeling and risk assessments, solvency assessments.
00:12:47.310 - 00:13:38.962, Speaker B: If this happens, could we survive? Could we liquidate fast enough? What are the collateral factors that we have to implement to be able to stay within a certain realm of security and comfort? And so when we're looking at a new asset, the same way that Gauntlet would do this for other platforms, we would go to Gauntlet and say, hey, we're thinking about adding this asset to our repertoire. What do you think about it? And they'll run a whole bunch of assessments, and they're an amazing team. If you haven't looked into Gauntlet, please do. The listeners and viewers, they're just phenomenal. And then they'll come back with reports and analysis and say, okay, well, this asset could work, but we can't collateralize it yet. There's not enough liquidity in the ecosystem. If something was to happen, if there was some sort of impact in the marketplace, we wouldn't be able to liquidate fast enough.
00:13:38.962 - 00:14:07.434, Speaker B: But if you want to offer support for lend and borrow, you can, you just can't collateralize it possibly. Or they might say, you can collateralize it, but it's really low. Or there will be a borrow cap. You can only borrow out a million of that asset, a million dollar equivalent of that asset. And so there's a few things that we can toggle to manage risk. Obviously, collateralization in general, the collateralization factor, and then the borrow limit. And those are kind of the three.
00:14:07.552 - 00:14:48.950, Speaker A: Dials that you talk about liquidity in the ecosystem. We're in a multi chain world now. People are on ethereum, solana, polygon, binance, smart chain, avalanche, phantom, all of the above. When you talk about liquidity, are you talking about the accessible liquidity on the c chain for that given token, or the amount of liquidity relevant to all the other supply that might be on other chains? If I take one link token and bring it over to avalanche, and then the rest of it is elsewhere, that's not a lot of liquidity on avalanche. It's going to be a lot harder to access. That's a pretty deep question. So to the audience, if that's too deep, I'm sorry, but this is actually a really.
00:14:48.950 - 00:14:51.706, Speaker A: We're living in a multi chain world, so thinking about these things is kind.
00:14:51.728 - 00:15:29.854, Speaker B: Of interesting, kind of important. Yeah, so that's a good question. So, I mean, from a pure decentralization standpoint and with the current tech infrastructure. So the way that our liquidations are done on our lending protocol is an account goes into imbalance, where it's now not over collateralized far enough anymore. And then something comes out in the contract that allows third parties to come liquidate that asset and then return the opposing asset that we need. Right. So if that happens in a decentralized way, that has to happen, generally speaking, in a flash loan environment, or in the one transaction, Right.
00:15:29.854 - 00:16:24.914, Speaker B: The way to mitigate that risk for the third party that's liquidating is they come in, they do it all in one transaction, they take their profit, and they go. And so we have a partnership with a platform called coup that we're involved with, and they have a liquidation bot specifically built for banki. And then there's other third parties that are liquidating loans on Benki, also other operators in the ecosystem. It's intended to be that way. And so the first kind of layer of risk mitigation and the most decentralized kind of perspective there is, what can we liquidate in a flash loan environment inside of avalanche, inside of the avalanche C chain. Now, the modeling does look and gauntlet does look know. Okay, so there might be liquidity inside of ethereum, for example, for the link token, but it has to be degraded in terms of its ability to help us in a liquidation environment, because there is then multi steps.
00:16:24.914 - 00:16:44.938, Speaker B: Someone has to take custody of the assets. They have to bridge the asset. Then there's slippage and other things on the Ethereum side. Then they have to bridge back the other asset. So there's multiple steps. It's not as clear, it's not as clean cut. Another way is you could facilitate liquidations to and from centralized exchanges.
00:16:44.938 - 00:17:37.470, Speaker B: But again, the risk there has to be factored, because it's not clean cut, it's not simple. It doesn't happen in one transaction. It's not immediate. So then we have to figure out, are there third parties willing to take that risk and go to other networks? Probably. If the yields are appropriate, then people will. But how do we ensure that those yields are appropriate? And what is an appropriate yield for someone to take that risk? And what happens in a market shock event? At what point does that yield become too low for risk, and how do we model that and prepare for that so we don't have insolvency, and that's what gauntlet works on. They run incredible models to look at centralized exchange liquidations, and where do we figure the parameters will balance out? They look at other networks, multichain.
00:17:37.470 - 00:17:51.634, Speaker B: What we're excited about is there's a lot of projects building in the space right now to figure out how to do cross chain swaps in a single transaction. And that'll be very interesting. We're talking to a lot of last.
00:17:51.672 - 00:18:34.682, Speaker A: Summer, just the composability on the EVM for DeFi was like, okay, now there's this extra level of complexity. Just getting our heads around that as an industry was pretty significant. And then now once you add multi chain, it doesn't just multiply it by two. If you're dealing with avalanche and ethereum, it probably squares the complexity, and then you add another polygon and BSc, so now you're cube, et cetera, et cetera. So the complexity just keeps increasing. Those attack surfaces, the risk surfaces keep increasing. We don't necessarily have clear answers to that here, nor do we need to, but that's a really interesting line of research, and I wonder how complexity scientists may contribute to this in the future.
00:18:34.682 - 00:18:37.330, Speaker A: Okay, those are my research plans.
00:18:37.990 - 00:19:19.242, Speaker B: The key really is, I think, one of the biggest challenges with the multichain world is remaining decentralized. There's a lot of ways to do multichain stuff in a very centralized fashion, but it's very difficult to do it in a completely decentralized way. And one of the kind of complexity factors that you didn't mention there, which is obviously present, is now different programming languages on non EVM chains. Right. So if you're going to try to build a platform that interacts with EVM on avalanche and rust on a different network, how does that work? Where do those two languages combine? How do you do that in a decentralized way? A lot of exciting things that still to be developed.
00:19:19.306 - 00:19:42.422, Speaker A: Interesting stuff. I want to pivot a little bit. I want to make sure we get a chance to get to know you and your team. Can you give me a brief, or maybe not brief. Do what you need to do. What's your crypto origin story? How did you get your crypto superpowers and get into this industry? And if you can touch on, you don't have to tell me about every individual, but is your team's background similar? Where do you all come from?
00:19:42.556 - 00:20:18.546, Speaker B: Yeah, so I was a partner with a hedge fund investment firm for years in Tradfi. And I remember hearing about bitcoin in the very early days, and I remember thinking, this is a complete scam. It was one of those things. That's how it was being portrayed to us in the investment world is that this was a scam. Don't let any of your clients even consider buying it, and so on and so forth. But I remember thinking and reading the initial white paper, thinking, this is kind of cool if they can actually pull this off, if this actually grows to scale, it might be kind of neat. Long story short, I kind of forgot about it at that time.
00:20:18.546 - 00:21:29.974, Speaker B: It was like a buz. And then it kind of went away in Canada anyways for a couple of years. And the longer I spent in traditional finance, the more I realized that in many cases, it felt like you were acting against the interest of your clients. And it became a sales environment where it wasn't about the underlying profitability as near as much as it was about bringing on new clients and making profit for the intermediaries. And so as time went on, I realized crypto was evolving a little bit. And how do I get involved in this space coming from tradfi, obviously, there wasn't a direct jump in 2015 16, so I started working on brand and messaging and marketing for crypto firms, and I partnered up with a group in New York and they were doing regulated fundraising for crypto projects in 1617, which obviously was kind of fun at the time. Everybody was raising money and away we went and we were doing a lot of branded messaging and we were working with another firm that did acceleration into the US government and we helped accelerate blockchain projects into the US government.
00:21:29.974 - 00:22:08.822, Speaker B: And I went, holy crap. We had a bit of an inside line into how developed some of this blockchain tech was even beyond cryptocurrencies. And I said, the future is closer than, we're closer to this reality than I originally thought. And I mean, you hear all the hype of like, let's trade tokens and 20 year olds are making millions of dollars. But for me it was really about a new financial paradigm. There's actually a world in which there's a lot more liberation of financial control, financial transparency. If you manage financial projects in this way, in a decentralized way, you can actually make money.
00:22:08.822 - 00:22:37.040, Speaker B: Not necessarily promising exorbitant money, exorbitant. Like, I know we all chase the 100 x thousand x, but when you're looking at larger portfolio management for people that might not be actively involved in flipping apes, there's a lot more consistent, predictable, transparent ways to make actual returns on investments. And so we just thought that was super interesting. The space wasn't really ready for it at scale yet, but there was a lot of development that was happening.
00:22:38.130 - 00:23:03.874, Speaker A: That idea of on chain analytics and chain link. Oracle's transparent. Oracle, where do you get your data? That transparency from a portfolio management standpoint is really fascinating. So if you can look at on chain data and clearly see like, these wallets are inactive, these wallets are active. Here's where the volume is going. These are peer to peer transfers, these are payment levels, if they're small or whatever. So you can kind of tell that stuff is really fascinating.
00:23:03.874 - 00:23:22.954, Speaker A: That's like the deep analytics. There's a bunch of places, Dune and Nanson, a bunch of places that do that sort of thing. Is that the sort of thing you're getting at? Like, well, the opportunity is there to do a lot more in terms of transparency and accessibility too, right? If it's all on chain, anybody can do that. It's not this proprietary data, it's all from Nasdaq or whatever.
00:23:23.072 - 00:24:01.302, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think it's also just about kind of where the ethical boundaries now exist in a way that they didn't before. So I remember being in Tradfi and one of the biggest lobbies we had at that time was how little information we had to provide to the investors, how at the time, you could hide a lot of the fees inside of the rates of return and all of these other things. And the fees were exorbitant. And that was a huge lobby. Organizations were spending millions, tens of millions of dollars lobbying against clarity to the client on how their assets are being managed and what the fees are. And blockchain just removes a lot of that. And we're big on data.
00:24:01.302 - 00:24:32.494, Speaker B: We're big on, on chain analytics. We have other products that are all about data, that provide blockchain data and different things. We won't get into that today, but it's a completely new paradigm for how products are built. How products are built with absolute focus on sustainability. DeFi has to be sustainable. It's code. The truth is in the code, not in manipulation and bailouts later on by financial institutions and governments.
00:24:32.494 - 00:24:49.798, Speaker B: And it's just so pure that it just brings a new level of opportunity for financial management, for individuals, for enterprise. It's exciting. I think within the next five to ten years, we're going to see some incredible shifts in our global paradigm. It's amazing.
00:24:49.884 - 00:25:11.710, Speaker A: I think we already have, and we're frog in the water sometimes been like, this is going to be great. And I don't know if it's boiling a frog is the right analogy, but that analogy of like we've become accustomed to, this is what Defi already can do. And so we can see from right now, well, look, five years out, whoa. But really where we are is actually also pretty significant.
00:25:12.370 - 00:25:17.970, Speaker B: I saw a pepe meme today of Pepe in the boiling water. So yeah, pretty relevant.
00:25:18.630 - 00:25:42.780, Speaker A: What keeps you motivated to build instead of almost 2 billion in TVL tomorrow, just for whatever reason people decide it's a million dollars, it goes way down. What keeps you motivated to keep building in this space, regardless of TVL? How do you position yourself? What's the sort of things you think about and keep in mind when you get up in the morning, why do you go build?
00:25:43.470 - 00:26:33.082, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think the primary motivation for a lot of people in this space, especially when you talk to project teams and developers, actually is not usually focused on the vanity metrics of TVL and platform size, although those are all important and they become the things we have to look at. We have a responsibility to our communities and our investors to do so. But I think the real excitement comes from being a transformative piece of a new society, a new way that people manage their finances. And I think right now, in our opinion, and this is part of our ethos at banky and even our other platforms. But is really. Defi is amazing, right? There's some amazing stuff that's happening.
00:26:33.082 - 00:26:55.422, Speaker B: There's some amazing adoption, but arguably, we're still kind of at the beginning of that early adopters curve in a lot of ways, because you have to try. You have to try to understand how to function in this world. It's not simple. The user experience is very challenging. Even just getting into Defi is confusing. And we were talking about this yesterday. I mean, you and I that have been around for a while, things happen slowly.
00:26:55.422 - 00:27:20.518, Speaker B: We're the boiled frog, right? Metamask came out, and IDex turned into Uniswap, and then BSC came out, and we figured out how to bridge, which was confusing, and custom networks in metamask and different wallets and all this other crazy stuff. But it happened slowly. It happened one thing at a time, but a new entrant into the space right now comes in and figures out, first step on ramp, okay, got to get money into the space.
00:27:20.604 - 00:27:21.142, Speaker A: Then what?
00:27:21.196 - 00:27:28.390, Speaker B: Where do I send it? How do I know how to send it? Oh, Metamask wallet. Then what if I want to put money into banky? How do I get there? Bridge.
00:27:28.470 - 00:27:29.820, Speaker A: What the heck is that?
00:27:32.110 - 00:28:12.666, Speaker B: And then you have to swap on it, amm and get into the wrap tokens. It's very confusing. And so I think, for us, it's all about, how can we work with other platforms, work with our platform within our realm of control, and make that experience for new users, both retail and institutional. We have a big focus on institutional and enterprise users for Benki, how do we make that transition more palatable? Because right now, it's very disjointed. You wouldn't even know about a lot of platforms unless you stumbled upon them. And then when you do, the uis are all different. They're confusing, potentially, if you don't know what you're looking at, that's what motivates us.
00:28:12.666 - 00:28:46.658, Speaker B: How can we build this into something that just becomes commonplace? It's a simple symbiosis of traditional finance, traditional banking for certain purposes that will exist, in my opinion, for the next few decades, for sure, but a symbiotic relationship between that and Defi, and now you have a choice. The choice isn't, do I want to spend all day figuring this out? The choice is which one serves the purpose, and you can move to and from different strategies and different approaches, and we're really long way from that.
00:28:46.744 - 00:29:03.382, Speaker A: You said you think that a lot of founders have this, not just your team. And I couldn't agree more. Just from working at Chainlink Labs and the way that teams here approach building Chainlink, there's integrations. You guys can track the Chainlink Twitter account. There's integrations every day. Multiple. It's not about the integrations.
00:29:03.382 - 00:29:22.960, Speaker A: It's about securing decentralized systems. It's about providing secure data. And those integrations are proof of that. The amount of value secured is proof of that. But that's not the end goal, right? The end goal is there needs to be secure infrastructure that people can rely on so projects like banky can come out and secure 2 billion in value, or whatever it happens to be.
00:29:23.730 - 00:30:03.466, Speaker B: Most founders will give you, if you ask them, will give you their actual vision. And all of these things that happen, TbL, token price investments, all these other weird things that happen along the way, are just ideally objective proof that you're moving further towards that vision. If your vision is a global, decentralized infrastructure where people can participate as much as they want, well, there's some steps along the way. You have to get to certain critical mass. You have to get to a certain ease of onboarding. And those are just the stepping stones along the way to validate that you're on your way to your vision. And I think we have more questions for you.
00:30:03.488 - 00:30:17.620, Speaker A: JD, what music do you listen to when you're in the zone? You're zoning out. You don't have meetings, you're not writing. You're just doing your tasks, finishing up basic stuff. And you put on some good headphones. You got some decent ones. And what do you listen to?
00:30:18.150 - 00:30:36.918, Speaker B: That's a good question. I have two genres of music that I listen to. If I'm in where I'm thinking, where I'm working on new ideas, figuring out how we're going to approach certain strategical. Strategic efforts. I listen to baroque music. Baroque music. It's a form of classical music.
00:30:36.918 - 00:30:55.870, Speaker B: It helps with memory, helps with recall. It just puts me in a good zone. That's probably about 30% of the time. The other 70% of the time. Music, puzzle solving. Yeah. There's actually been a lot of studies that it does help trigger certain areas of your brain related to memory, both retention and recall.
00:30:55.870 - 00:31:10.242, Speaker B: So it's interesting. I've done that since university, and then I'm a huge EDM fan. I'm just a big kid when I go to the gym and when I'm out getting amped up about something, EDM all the way.
00:31:10.376 - 00:31:26.402, Speaker A: There's a big EDM contingency in crypto. I'm well aware of them. I'm fine with it. It's not my main gym, but I'm fine with it. We got people in the chat who like this as well. They like the broke, they like all of it. What's coming up on the roadmap.
00:31:26.402 - 00:31:44.110, Speaker A: So there's actually quite a few questions in here about when are you going to have more assets collateralized when staking. Everybody always wants to know. You can pick and choose what you want to talk about on the roadmap, but give us a sense of what are the things coming down the pipe that you're the most excited about in the short, medium term.
00:31:45.090 - 00:32:17.154, Speaker B: We have a lot of stuff coming down the pipe. Some of it we can't quite publicly announce yet. But Benki is not just a lending protocol. Benki is a Defi platform that builds defi primitives. So the lending protocol is the first iteration, the first Defi primitive. We're well down the road of developing some other DeFi primitives, which we will announce relatively soon. We're not going to keep people in the dark too long, of course, but it's very exciting.
00:32:17.154 - 00:33:27.440, Speaker B: We're just firming up some fairly important partnerships and different things. So DeFi primitives with the goal of building a regulated and completely compliant subnet and bringing a full DeFi platform onto a subnet in a way that almost is like regulation as a service. I'm kind of tongue in cheek that a little bit. But our goal, and we're well down the road with institutional relationships and meeting and doing focus groups with key stakeholders in different jurisdictions, in terms of regulators, in terms of traditional finance institutions, in building the piping, in building the infrastructure, in building the regulatory structures, to have a subnet that is easy and manageable for tradfi to tap into. So on the EVM, on the C chain, DeFi on Avalanche, we'll be releasing a few more DeFi primitives in the relative short term, which all have a very close relationship to lending. We're not just launching random stuff, they'll all tie in very nicely together. So we're really excited about that sooner rather than later, which is kind of cool.
00:33:27.440 - 00:33:35.538, Speaker B: I mean, we're not talking years from now. We're talking in the next couple of quarters. We'll see some pretty interesting stuff. We have some other.
00:33:35.624 - 00:34:10.294, Speaker A: One sec. For the people who are not as familiar with avalanche, subnets are like. So avalanche is a consensus protocol. It's like how all the nodes come to consensus and agree that, yes, this is the state of transactions and balances on the chain subnets, basically you can build separate blockchains on top of that consensus. And they're kind of interconnected in some ways. They share security. So the C chain where Defi is on avalanche right now, that's one subnet, but it's got its own governance subnet for staking the P chain.
00:34:10.294 - 00:34:28.180, Speaker A: It's got the X chain that's like a Utxo, like bitcoin. You can just transfer assets, but subnets are coming is something that's been on the roadmap for avalanche for a while, and projects or companies or whatever it is, can build their own separate subnets. So that's a really interesting. Putting that into context. Very interesting to me.
00:34:28.950 - 00:35:20.770, Speaker B: What's really compelling, I think. And we're not the only group that's looking at regulation and try to figure out how to combine. And I don't believe that regulators are just going to look the other way. Obviously, that's clear with even the Coinbase stuff that's coming out recently. So it's our responsibility as platforms, as leaders in the space to be a part of the conversation, to get a seat at the table, to work with traditional finance institutions and figure out how to build these products in a way, how to regulate these products in a way that's not detrimental to the space, but is also as aligned with the regulatory motivations that need to exist in different jurisdictions. So that's a big kind of piece focus of ours. Put our head in the mouth as a lion and say, hey, we want to be a party to this conversation so that we're not just reacting to what happens.
00:35:20.770 - 00:35:50.202, Speaker B: And if we do that properly, our subnet definitely will be a leader in terms of integration with traditional finance. We're working a lot right now on custody, on institutional custody providers. We have some stealthily participating in our protocol already, which is very exciting. And we have a few more large ones coming out that we can. Lot of. A lot of really exciting things. A lot of really exciting things.
00:35:50.336 - 00:36:02.462, Speaker A: That's all very exciting. We'll stay track. I got a whole bunch of great questions, like at the end, but no, I'm running out of time. I gotta go. So we gotta wrap this up. So, Scott, I see your question. Really good question.
00:36:02.462 - 00:36:13.700, Speaker A: Come back to another chain link live. I got more next week. And head to the Benky chats. There's telegram, there's discord. There's all sorts of stuff down below. You can see that in the description. JD, where does your community mostly hang out?
00:36:14.150 - 00:36:20.022, Speaker B: Most of the time we hang out on Telegram. You can go to our telegram channel. I think that's going to be in the.
00:36:20.076 - 00:36:21.298, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll be in the description.
00:36:21.394 - 00:36:38.566, Speaker B: In the description as well. We are opening an official discord relatively soon. It's not open yet, but it will be pretty soon. So Twitter. We're on Twitter quite a bit, but telegram is the place. You can see all the founding team is also in there. We have some amazing community managers.
00:36:38.566 - 00:36:39.978, Speaker B: But yeah, Telegram is a good place.
00:36:40.064 - 00:36:49.166, Speaker A: JD, thanks for coming on and talking to me. I really appreciate getting to know you and get to know Benki a lot better. Let's do this again. Let's catch up in a couple of months and see where everybody's at. Sound good?
00:36:49.268 - 00:36:50.846, Speaker B: Would love to, man. Thanks a ton.
00:36:50.948 - 00:37:08.494, Speaker A: I appreciate your time. I'll talk to you later, man. Hey, everybody. Thank you for coming. Thank you for the great questions. I'm sorry we couldn't get to all your questions. We have limited time, but use those questions as a way to facilitate conversation in the banky telegram community and other places as well.
00:37:08.494 - 00:37:30.938, Speaker A: Please feel free to join them. Follow them on Twitter and join the chainlink communities. Chainlink telegram, Chainlink Discord, follow Chainlink Twitter and there's also the smart contract, smart underscore contract Twitter, where you can get updates about when these Chainlink live events are happening. We do three or four of these a week. We talk to all sorts of awesome, interesting projects. We talk to NFT and gaming projects. We talk to great defi projects, blockchains, all sorts of stuff.
00:37:30.938 - 00:37:44.026, Speaker A: My name is Andy Boyan. Thank you so much for coming to Chainlink Labs. Thank you, Tatiana, for hanging out and being a moderator for me and for the great questions again, to the community, to JD and banky. Don't forget. Know I gotta say it. I'm sorry, I gotta say it. Smash.
00:37:44.026 - 00:37:50.330, Speaker A: Smash that subscribe button. Help me out. Smash and like and share. And I will talk to you guys next week. Bye.
