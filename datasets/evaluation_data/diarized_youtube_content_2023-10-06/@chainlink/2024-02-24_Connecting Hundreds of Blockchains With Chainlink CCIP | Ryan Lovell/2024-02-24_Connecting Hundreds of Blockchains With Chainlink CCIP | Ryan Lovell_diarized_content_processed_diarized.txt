00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.062, Speaker A: My name is Ryan Lavelle. I do use case development for capital markets at Chainlink Labs. Previously, I worked at a company called Vanguard that's the second largest asset manager in the world and built and designed a lot of their blockchain projects around the 2017 2018 time frame. A lot of our projects were built on a siloed single blockchain. And when you look at who participating in capital markets, such as investors, portfolio managers, they need to get those assets out and about. It can't just live on one siloed ledger. So what was really exciting to me about Chainlink is the software and the network.
00:00:43.062 - 00:01:17.480, Speaker A: It's designed to be blockchain agnostic. So working very long with one simple technology stack, and I think back in the 2017 2018 time frame, everyone thought that there would be a few networks where everyone would come and connect to them. It's been quite the opposite. There's been hundreds of different types of chains. And what's really exciting to me is chain link and the vision of CCIP connecting all of those different chains that really make capital markets work in a better way.
