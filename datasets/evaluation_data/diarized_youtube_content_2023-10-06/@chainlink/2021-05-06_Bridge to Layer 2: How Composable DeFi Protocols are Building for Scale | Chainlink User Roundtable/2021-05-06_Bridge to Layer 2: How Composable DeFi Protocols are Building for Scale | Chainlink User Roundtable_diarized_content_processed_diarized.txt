00:00:00.170 - 00:00:46.422, Speaker A: Which is completely crazy when you think about it. Like the wall DeFi ecosystem was less than 1 billion a year ago, and now you have a single protocol that grow from $1 billion in a day. And that's actually a good thing for Ave. But it's especially an even better thing for the wall ecosystem because we reach project market feast, decentralized finance, there's a fully fledged ecosystem. Like I often say, it's a fact that most Ave users don't use Ave. They interact with Aave, with, for example, the smart wallets in startup. Or if I server, they use Ynvo, they use mstable, they use like curve finance.
00:00:46.422 - 00:00:56.640, Speaker A: All these protocols and those synergies, those bridges we build between the community and the protocol. Next Defi and stockpile, at least in my eyes.
00:01:03.490 - 00:01:37.866, Speaker B: Hi everyone. My name is Andy Boyan with Chainlink Labs, and this is a Chainlink user roundtable. We wanted to take some time today to learn about Instadapt's recently released Ave debt financing bridge. This release takes advantage of composability in DeFi to let users move debt from layer one on Ethereum to Polygon. Also Ethereum. We brought Mark Zeller from Aave, Luis Gitpusha working on Gelato, Samiak Jain from Instadep, and Pradav Maiswari from Polygon to talk about this release and what it means for scaling defi. Now, we've already been chatting a little bit.
00:01:37.866 - 00:01:51.600, Speaker B: We jumped in a room and just started talking DeFi as we are what builders are want to do. But let me start with Samiak. Congratulations on the launch. Can you explain what this debt financing solution accomplishes? How does it.
00:01:53.410 - 00:02:57.922, Speaker C: I mean, on a very basic level, it's like instadep enter into the market with the debt refinancing feature. Two years ago, when we launched maker compound refinancing, and it was like Instadapt's thing to build a refinancing thing. Then after this, we saw Ave on Polygon and the opportunities between chains. So this was the obvious next step after doing composability, extreme composability on layer one. What about the composability between chains, like between the L1 and l two s, and possibly in future between l two s and l two s. We thought about the complexities, like you can easily move your balances from l one to l two s, but you can't really move your depth positions. And if you want to move a depth position, then you'll have to wipe your daP, move the collateral tokens, and then you have to borrow the DaP, which is technically not possible because user probably don't have depth to pay back.
00:02:57.922 - 00:03:11.100, Speaker C: Like if they have the tokens to pay back, then they won't have a depth position in the first place. So that was the complexities. And we thought about the technicalities. So how it works. Should I get into that?
00:03:12.430 - 00:03:15.340, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. Go into a little bit of how it works. That'd be great.
00:03:15.950 - 00:03:46.846, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically, what we are doing is we are not moving the entire position from layer one to L2. What we are doing is we are getting the user's position on layer one into our smart contract. So we are moving users ave position into our giant ave position on l one. And then we are transferring the data using the polygon's decentralized data transfer from l one to Polygon. And we are transferring the user's position data from l one to l two. And then with the help of gelato, they are tracking.
00:03:46.846 - 00:04:20.206, Speaker C: Like whenever there is new data transfer, they run an automation. And if the transaction is going to successful, it creates a position. And we have a liquidity on l two, which ave provided us with automatic tokens, which helps us to create a position for users. So users position is in l one in our contract, and we give them a new position on l two. And over time, we do the settlement between l one and l two s. And it's just like we do this back end settlement, but there is a liquidity, a huge amount of liquidity to facilitate this process. So that's how it works.
00:04:20.206 - 00:04:48.760, Speaker C: It's not like transferring the tokens, it's about just transferring the data and just doing the round off and only transferring the assets that are required in general. So if a user wants to move depth and another user wants to move, sorry, a user wants to move diadept and another user wants to move dicolateral, then we won't move that from l one to l two, rather than we will just settle that diadept and dicolateral into l one, and we'll just transfer the user's data. So that's how it's working.
00:04:49.610 - 00:05:12.538, Speaker B: The problem statement is, what problem is this solving? It's, well, I've got a debt position. I owe money, but I don't have the money to pay back the money, and I don't want to. Right. It's a bunch of fees to settle that debt and then move over and do all that. Let's simplify that process. That's fantastic. And Luis, you're from Gelato and Samiac.
00:05:12.538 - 00:05:23.620, Speaker B: Mentioned gelato automation is part of this. You guys also had a recent release. Can you talk about that release and how this plays into the instadap debt financing a little bit?
00:05:24.070 - 00:06:22.374, Speaker D: Yes. So actually we were working with instadap already since last summer, and in February we launched a depth bridge on layer one on Ethereum Mainet that was using the Gelato version one. It took us quite a long time to build it. It was a complicated feature, basically moving debt from maker avault into AvA in order to forego liquidation. And yeah, so recently Samyak told me that they are also working on basically this migration to Polygon. And we were already thinking, okay, of course we also want to be on Polygon, especially if DAP is there and we can help them with the bot network to improve ux there. And yeah, so it was by coincidence that we recently also released our Gelato version two, which is a much less opinionated protocol than the version one.
00:06:22.374 - 00:07:03.986, Speaker D: It's way less smart contracts than the version one, which usually means you can use more like typescript, Python, whatever you want to write your tests to build your features. So this increases the speed of delivery a lot. And we were able to, with our new gelato version, write the bot software that was able to serve and automate this instead of bridge from layer one to L2 in just like 1 hour or so. And also, I have to give a huge shout out to the Polygon dev experience. I didn't know what to do initially. I just went to the docs. I literally just changed the URL for the network in my hardhead project and just deployed the contracts there.
00:07:03.986 - 00:07:17.750, Speaker D: If you don't use any contracts that rely on dependencies that aren't there yet, it's so easy to get started. It was super easy, and we got everything up and running in less than a day. So that was pretty smooth.
00:07:18.350 - 00:07:57.800, Speaker B: That's awesome. Pranav, before we jumped into the discussion, you were talking about something about retail users and how with tools like this, well, now we're seeing the dev experience is faster, we're getting better at writing dev tools and documentation and getting things live, and now the automation is getting faster with things like gelato scaling is getting faster. This is all happening. Your proposal was that this is what we need to see more retail users. And that was my question is for Ave on Polygon and Polygon, are you seeing more retail? Are you seeing still just a bunch of whales coming? Like, what's it look like?
00:07:58.410 - 00:08:36.594, Speaker E: I won't say that it's just about retail or just about whales coming. It is a mix of both really coupled into really great experience that polygon is providing with Aave's great debt, market positions and stuff like that. The one thing that we are talking before this particular recording was that retail currently are not so well versed in DeFi on the Ethereum networks. The reason that might occur on that particular part is that maybe because we don't have the correct user experience over there or there is a lot of transaction fees that is required to make things happen.
00:08:36.712 - 00:08:37.042, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:37.096 - 00:10:14.770, Speaker E: And that is the reason why L2s are definitely the way for retail people, the people who have less amount of stake to actually do, but still want to experience and understand how DFI works, if it is an alternative to banking, and how we can have this open position where people can just lend, borrow and make things happen without third parties and related retail stuff. So that was basically the gist of me talking about that. So yeah, that is basically what Polygon is trying to do. It is going to be, or rather trying to be the lay to give the lay to experience, which will not just attract defi whales, but all the retail people, or all the people who love Ethereum, who love being on an open financial market ecosystem. And yeah, that's what we are working on currently. And that is the reason why Ave on Polygon has attracted a lot of retail users. Just to quote some stats, like it's been two to three weeks since Ave launched and we have about $1 billion of liquidity and 7500 people already onboarded on Polygon seeing that particular thing, we actually committed a good amount of value, about $150,000,000, just to make this happen and facilitate this, to assure and accrue more of the liquidity mining program that actually makes things even better and incentivizes retail users not just to try DFI, but get into it, get well versed with it, and leave the financial depth market positions that exist in the current ecosystems, in the physical world.
00:10:14.840 - 00:10:22.366, Speaker B: Right. Mark, what are you hearing from your users about user experience and Ave in general, but ave on Polygon?
00:10:22.558 - 00:11:09.122, Speaker A: Well, the first thing is that finally I can try defi. Because let's face it, if your net worth is less than five figures or even less than six figures, it's very hard to use ethereum layer one right now. And personally, we are all here in this panel building things and we are building finance for everyone because we are all sharing that idea that we are providing an alternative to what exists in the world right now. Because what exists in the world right now is not good enough for most people. And if we build something for only people that are worth $10,000 and more, I'm not interested. I would not spend 16 hours of my day every day since six years to just that. That's not the point.
00:11:09.122 - 00:11:59.614, Speaker A: And I think everyone agree in this panel. And thanks to Polygon, I can literally, if I have like $50 equivalent and I'm someone in India, I can send that to global transact.com and send wire transfer from my indian account directly to Polygon and they will deliver me the asset directly on polygon. I don't have to use any centralized exchange. That's something that is super easy and will be done in less than a couple of days. Worst case scenario, then I sign up with my metamask on wallet network, Matic network and they will airdrop me a very small fraction of matic. But transaction fee are so cheap that that small fraction of matic will cover a few transactions for me and I can deposit that into ave thanks to liquidity mining.
00:11:59.614 - 00:12:48.194, Speaker A: I will get some matic to get my transaction fee independence and get my share of the network as an active participant in the blockchain. Maybe what I deposit, I will deposit that into curve. Maybe I will do my first create on comet, swap on quickswap. I will try the ecosystem and I will learn from there because there's a lot of theory online, there's a lot of things we can read, we can learn that way. There's a lot of tutorials, but nothing will replace actually doing things like having a wallet with a few bucks in it and doing those things on Ethereum, doing the transaction and the interaction I talked about. It's at least, I don't know, $8150 of transaction fee on Matic. It's not one set, it's much lower than one set to do all that.
00:12:48.194 - 00:13:15.146, Speaker A: And finally everybody can access defi again. And I think it's game changer. That's a paradigm shift. And that's all the efforts we did in the ecosystem since this summer and six years, to be honest. There's still a lot to do, there's still a lot to improve. We are still all working on it, but we are getting there. We want DeFi for everyone working in.
00:13:15.168 - 00:13:24.000, Speaker B: The space in early 2020, you could do all this stuff on Ethereum for a lot less. It's just the way I feel like people.
00:13:26.770 - 00:13:53.926, Speaker C: I remember when we entered into the industry in 2017, we used to do all the testing on main net, just deploy the contracts without any issue. It was like the gas was one way, so it used to be less than one dollars and we used to do all the things. And now it's like you have to do super good testing before going proceeding forward because the deploying contract might cost you 400 $500, right?
00:13:54.028 - 00:14:45.800, Speaker E: And also, just to add up on that, there are many teams who have talked to us who thought that we don't want to move away from Ethereum and move to a L2. We want to be on Ethereum itself, and let's try to actually optimize the contract that we have and try to subsidize the fees or make it work anyhow just to decrease the fees and make things work. But actually, with the Ethereum price boom rocketing and a lot of congestion in the network, definitely scaling solutions were the only solution. And L2 actually gives you that opportunity to be on Ethereum ecosystem, use that security, and despite that, have the security and have the scale of the one which you envisioned, something like 7000 transactions a second or something like that.
00:14:46.970 - 00:15:36.470, Speaker A: And what I really like about Polygon is that it's several layer project. So what most of us using as protocol right now is the proof of stake blockchain, that some will code sidechain, some will code commit chain. Obviously it's a big topic, and maybe that's not the main topic today, but it's only one small part of what is Polygon. And there's going to be also other solutions that will be implemented. And the whole ecosystem of polygon is about experimenting, trying new things, building step by step, build things that works now, but also build things that will work later and that will be even better later. And that whole reason is super interesting when you are a developer and you support a protocol.
00:15:37.450 - 00:16:52.314, Speaker D: Actually, I wanted to also follow up on what you said earlier, mark, with how on Polygon now, normal users can do a lot of stuff that they wouldn't be able to do on Ethereum. At Gelato, we are mostly developer focused, and I would say the same is true also for the developer users, right? The people that maybe don't have funding in their startup or whatsoever. All of this beautiful experimentation that we were able to do, like Samiak said back in 2018 2019, for little money on Ethereum Mainet, it's gone now, right? Like every time we write a smart contract, we have to spend hours and hours just optimizing gas. And while it kind of gets like maybe a game for some, it actually feels like wasting time sometimes, spending so much time just optimizing, working around the EVM gas stuff, which is completely arbitrary, right? It's weird. So I think I'm really excited for that. I hope that on polygon we can again have a renaissance of developer experimentation, again writing smart contracts without fear of how much gas something will mean for gelato. We have so many features that we had to say goodbye to half a year ago that would require a lot of transactions.
00:16:52.314 - 00:17:38.814, Speaker D: Our goal at one point was to maximize the transactions per user by basically letting them access bots, right? A normal user would just manually transact during the day maybe, but not at night when they sleep. With gelato, we want everyone to basically increase their rate of transactions, the per capita rate of transactions a lot. And of course on Ethereum mainnet this is at the moment a weird, awkward goal to have because everyone wants to reduce their transactions on martish again, or on polygon matic, we can again have use cases like, I don't know, maybe trading volatility in a really small margin that become possible again, opportunities that are open again, just because we don't have to always think is it even worth it if it costs $200 worth of gas for every transaction? So I'm really excited for that as well.
00:17:39.012 - 00:19:09.382, Speaker A: Also about shamlink, know that transaction fee are very cheap on polygon. You can develop new use case because basically in Defi all the LTV parameters, the liquidation parameters where the loan are over collateralized with pretty conservative parameters, but it's due because transaction fees are expensive on ethereum layer one and also the network is relatively slow. And it's also a lot of legacy from the early days of DeFi where the whole liquidity and volume were like less than 1% that it is right now. And when you have this kind of network and this kind of playground as a developers where you can test new things and do these kind of things, you can have like price feed oracle from gen link that we use at Ave, that instead of having a derivation threshold of 1% 2%, you can put it at zero 1%. And if you do that, you can create special market, for example on Ave or on mecha Dow that will have like a much more risky LTV because you know that the price information inside your smart contract will be updated much more often and much more precisely. So you create whole new use case. I'm thinking for example of margin trading.
00:19:09.382 - 00:19:25.300, Speaker A: Like margin trading, it's not very efficient right now on Defi for a whole lot of reasons. But if you have faster cheaper transaction, you can enable this kind of use case. A full range of new use case are possible now, right.
00:19:28.310 - 00:19:29.026, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:19:29.128 - 00:19:29.954, Speaker C: Sure. Okay.
00:19:29.992 - 00:20:27.062, Speaker E: So the faster cheaper transaction just not actually increases the whole lot possibility. But also, as I was specifying on, increases the user experience, right? Because currently on ethereum you cannot have meta agnostic relayer based transactions in which you just give them the public private key and the relayer does the transaction for you because it is economically not viable, right? All the transactions you're doing, all of them happening via relayer and the relayer paying for it. But on matic on the other hand, it is very much possible. And that is the reason why GSN and biconomy both are meta transaction agnostic relayer infrastructures are so very much popular. And that is the reason if a user comes, he does not have to have Matic or any of these things to do the transactions or interact with the Dapps deployed on Matic. What they need to have is just a public private key, maybe from metamask or use any kind of wallet. They just need to sign a transaction, give them the authority to do that.
00:20:27.062 - 00:20:50.830, Speaker E: And rest of the things is handled by the ecosystem, right? So there is a whole lot of new infrastructural and usage based things coming up. And definitely L2s will emphasize that, empower that. And yeah, definitely you are right on that part, that a lot of new opportunities will open not just in DFI nfts, but a lot of new things, let's say social tokens.
00:20:53.090 - 00:21:10.660, Speaker B: So great user experience changes with scaling and all these bridges and composability, what challenges still remain? Like what are kind of the next major walls that as developers and builders you guys are going after you got in mind? I know everyone's thinking like 3610 months down the road, what's next?
00:21:12.790 - 00:22:07.250, Speaker E: What I would say, as per the experience of people using wallet, which is official wallet of Matic or polygon, is that whenever people transfer their funds, or let's say tokens from Ethereum to Matic, it takes about eight to 10 minutes. And that again is not that quick. But it is still okay for people to do that. But when on the other hand they're moving their tokens from something like Matic to Ethereum because of the security and decentralization of the bridge, it takes about 3 hours, right? I can go into the technical part, but I'm not touching that surface. But currently it takes about 3 hours because the checkpoint that matic does is about every 3 hours. So it is about 3 hours. And we cannot expect people right now who are the retail, again, retail users to wait for funds once they have transferred and booked their stuff on Matic to avail it in 3 hours or 6 hours or whatever, right? And that is one of the things that currently polygon is working on.
00:22:07.250 - 00:23:05.394, Speaker E: We are working on a fast exit for moving assets from something like Ethereum to matic. Biconomy is building one of these solutions and other one is being built by a connect network. They have partnered with decentral games and their exit was live before some time back I checked using their state channel based approach, they can move their funds from Matic to Ethereum in our wallet also included it for USDC, USDT and two, three stable coins which were very active. The only problem, or the only hurdle in using connects for fast exits from Matic to Ethereum, which takes about two or 1 minute and increases the user experience, is that the vector node that does all this movement requires its own liquidity. And that's where we have to think about if, let's say a token wants to move from Matic to Ethereum using fast exit. The vector node which makes it happen on the connect has to have its own liquidity. And that's where sometimes there is imbalance.
00:23:05.394 - 00:23:21.754, Speaker E: Let's say there is a lot of traffic moving from Ethereum to Matic. So there will be a dry up of liquidity on that vector node and that will cause the issue. So yeah, connect's team is definitely working on that. And we are also exploring more and more options of fast exits from Matic to Ethereum and vice versa, and making.
00:23:21.792 - 00:23:33.694, Speaker B: Things even better as there's more defi legos. You got to speed up each lego in the chain, right? Like, okay, now we got to speed up the bridge. Samiak, what are you guys working on? What's your challenges that you're solving?
00:23:33.742 - 00:24:20.798, Speaker C: Next on the challenges we are targeting, we just launched the l one l two bridge. Now there is a huge opportunity on polygon. There were a lot of ideas before that we had which we weren't able to execute on layer one. Either it's automation or once. Now polygon has scalability, so you can also bring back the limit orders and many other different kinds of things. So one thing that we are currently exploring and probably might work, might start the work soon, is defi limit orders, in which you can create limit orders through your defi positions. So basically a swap through your defi position.
00:24:20.798 - 00:25:09.950, Speaker C: So let's say if you want to do some earnings through your defi positions, you can't use those assets right now. If you have an ave position in which you have Ethereum collateral and diadapp let's say you want to provide a swap for stable coins so you can switch your diadapt to USDC by creating a limit order and back and forth so the public can get a swap between die and USDC, and you can switch your DAP from between die and USDC and earn the margin that you are taking maybe 0.5% or something. So debt swap, collateral swap, leveraging, saving, all these kind of things can happen through defi limit orders. And now there is scalability. So these solutions will be viable. So this is something that we will explore.
00:25:09.950 - 00:25:25.122, Speaker C: But yeah, this is something that we can really build on polygon without thinking of the fees. Right now, it's not possible on layer one because everyone is into amm because of the gas price. So limit orders is not kind of the thing. But yeah, this is one of the things.
00:25:25.176 - 00:25:35.238, Speaker B: And something like that would that tighten the arbitrage and bring prices all closer to their peg as well, because there's so much that now you got automated arbitrage for no money.
00:25:35.324 - 00:26:14.110, Speaker C: It will be. So basically, just think like you are providing swaps through your ave position. Like that position you're not going to. It's just sitting idle like you have created your position. It can also be a position like, let's say die collateral and die dap. Now you're providing a swap between die to USDC from collateral swap and dap swap. So basically, let's say you have $100 of assets, but you are able to provide a swap worth of $1,000 because you have just made your position so big, like $100 position, and now you have $600 worth of collateral and $500 worth of depth.
00:26:14.110 - 00:27:01.086, Speaker C: Now you can provide a $600 worth of collateral swap and $500 worth of depth swap. So it's like $1,100 worth of swap through your $100 position. So it's like eleven x swap through a limit order, which is not possible, which has not been possible ever before. And I think this can bring the price way closer, especially on the stable coins, but also on Ethereum and rabbitc or other things when user wants to do collateral swap between ethereum and rap BTC. And there's one more thing, like on the riskiness of the position. So let's say rabbitc has lower liquidation limit than ethereum. Now, if your position is about to get liquidated, then swap your wrapbitc collateral into ethereum collateral.
00:27:01.086 - 00:27:18.118, Speaker C: So you will get a margin on your liquidation, because Ethereum has higher liquidation limit. So if these kind of limit orders will be possible, then that is something that is possible. That could be possible on Polygon, but not on Alvin. That is one thing that we are exploring currently.
00:27:18.284 - 00:27:30.700, Speaker B: So Samiak went into his file cabinet and pulled out all his weird dream journal ideas of what he wanted to build a year ago or two years ago, and now he's making it all come to life. That's pretty cool. Luis, what are you guys.
00:27:32.830 - 00:27:42.914, Speaker D: Yeah, like I said, we just released the version two, which the main aim of the rearchitecture was to allow us to ship a new feature every day.
00:27:42.952 - 00:27:43.540, Speaker C: Basically.
00:27:45.510 - 00:28:23.902, Speaker D: We do serve dev developers, so the main goal is that developers come to us with a problem or something they need automated, and then we write the bot software that automates it. But we also have some of our own features. Like we recently revamped our original Alpha UI from over a year ago, which had limit orders back then, and now it's back live. We reanimated it. We shut it down for like a year or so because we were only focusing on developers, but we thought, what the hell? Let's also launch limit orders. Why not? So we have that live at the moment. Sorbie finance got quite a lot of orders in already.
00:28:23.902 - 00:28:50.438, Speaker D: This is on Ethereum mainet. But we soon want to also, like probably today or tomorrow, launch that on Quickswap. So we also have limited orders on quickswap. That will be really cool. We already have many requests from users that basically say that the transaction costs are too high. So that will be mean. Whatever instadep wants to automate or Avo wants to automate on Polygon, we are there.
00:28:50.438 - 00:28:57.446, Speaker D: We can help you with that. And, yeah, I think a lot of the focus this summer will be on L2 for sure.
00:28:57.628 - 00:29:02.060, Speaker B: Fantastic. Mark, what challenges do you see are next? What's Ave building next?
00:29:03.310 - 00:29:59.526, Speaker A: So Ave is about to deploy two new products, but I'm not at the liberty to share them. But you can expect big things from Ave in the next few, let's say, weeks, even if it stays. But, you know, development works. But I will say that right now, the biggest bottleneck for Polygon adoption is the on ramp and off ramp. So to help people, like people that just discovered crypto maybe three months ago or six months ago and are listening to us right now, they want to jump in, they want to say, oh, I heard those guys speaking in the panel, and I want to try this thing. And all they do that in many countries is super hard, to be honest, in many countries around the world, it's super hard to access. It's super hard to create an account in the centralized exchange.
00:29:59.526 - 00:30:36.562, Speaker A: Most centralized exchange won't let you withdraw directly to Polygon. They will let you withdraw to Ethereum layer one, then you take the bridge, but doing that will cost you probably $40, $50. That's too much for most people. You have transact, you have runtime network, the interrupt I talked about, but that's not enough. I think that's probably one of the biggest things to improve over the next few weeks. For example, there's been an initiative I did with the Kinex team about BSC. So the binance smart chain blockchain and polygon blockchain bridge, in order to have some liquidity.
00:30:36.562 - 00:31:37.850, Speaker A: So if you are a binance user, you can withdraw some funds directly to the BSC and then send those funds from the BSE to Polygon. This initiative is like a bit more than two weeks old, got thousands of users, millions of dollars of volume. It was very successful for a test, and liquidity will increase a lot over the next few days inside that bridge that will allow people to access more this and, yeah, there's still a lot to do. I have the feeling that DeFi is much better right now than one years ago. When we look at what we can do with decentralized finance, what are the system and the application? But I want DeFi to be much better in one year from now. And I think we are all working together on this. It's incredible that in our ecosystem, it's only synergies like Ave use shedding price feed, we use instadap, and people can use instadap to use Ave.
00:31:37.850 - 00:32:12.502, Speaker A: I really want to work with gelato on automation. I have a lot of good ideas, so we should definitely start a chat, please, just after this call. And yeah, there's so many good things we can do together. And the target audience, it's the average users, like people that just discovered disco. It's fun defi, and will discover Defi in six months or in one years. We want to provide them the best experience. They are the reason we are working countless hours in this ecosystem, because they deserve it.
00:32:12.502 - 00:32:17.894, Speaker A: They deserve a bit alternative to finance that. What we have right now, for most.
00:32:17.932 - 00:32:49.954, Speaker B: People, could not say it better. I'm going to wrap this up here, you guys. Thank you so much for coming to have this conversation from Chainlink Labs. We just wanted to sit down and learn about this product, learn about what's happening on Polygon and Ave and all over the. So this is just extremely exciting for us and for Defi. So I really appreciate your time so will our audience for all of these projects. I'm going to put all the links down in the YouTube description so I won't go around and have you tell everything where you are.
00:32:49.954 - 00:33:14.246, Speaker B: I'm going to fill up that YouTube description. But here's my plea for the audience. Join these communities. Go to the discords, go to the telegram, join chainlink, join Instagram, join gelato, join Affe, and join Polygon. There's so much good activity that happens there, networking. You get information about these new products, and this is where all this happens. These are coordinated in the chats, these projects like that.
00:33:14.246 - 00:33:28.780, Speaker B: So please go join them. Thank you all for watching this panel, our Chainlink user roundtable, our bridge to l two. We'll have more of this kind of thing soon. So, like, and subscribe to the chain link YouTube channel. And thank you very much.
