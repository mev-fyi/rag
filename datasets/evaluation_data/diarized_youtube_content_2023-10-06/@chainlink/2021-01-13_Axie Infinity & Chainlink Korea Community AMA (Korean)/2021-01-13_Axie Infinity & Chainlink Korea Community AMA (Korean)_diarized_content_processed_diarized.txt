00:12:33.980 - 00:12:36.280, Speaker A: See technique.
00:12:46.060 - 00:13:26.152, Speaker C: So with chain link, we are doing two things. First, we're using the price feeds for our NFT marketplace. So the reason that we do this is that we need a stable and reliable price feed for our marketplace. In the past we were using one site, for example, coin market cap. And if coin market cap went down, then suddenly our website would have no.
00:13:26.206 - 00:13:34.410, Speaker B: Stable price feed price. Peter going and then Chungama then Hangaji website.
00:13:53.940 - 00:14:13.844, Speaker C: Yeah. So the second use for Chainlink in our system is that we're using chainlink for the randomization process. So we're using the chainlink VRF to determine the rarity of body parts when certain really rare axes called origins are born.
00:14:14.012 - 00:14:40.210, Speaker B: Say to one day uninsiraco tongue song has maintaining k of. Yeah. Kohiki song, et cetera. Kung Jung the poetry kit training.

00:15:11.110 - 00:15:17.060, Speaker B: What kind of leader do you have when you use oracle like chain link?
00:15:17.910 - 00:15:39.370, Speaker C: So basically on our website, players see the price of axes in ether, right? But a lot of our players, they don't know what 0.1 ether means, so they need that price to be converted to dollars. So basically what we're using user when.
00:15:39.520 - 00:15:45.610, Speaker B: You kagogen .0 young dumb.
00:15:56.550 - 00:16:03.860, Speaker C: So yeah, they need to. That's basically it, right? The US dollar price feed is really important.
