00:00:03.210 - 00:00:04.880, Speaker A: So my unicorn is ready.
00:00:06.050 - 00:00:11.280, Speaker B: Background. I love it.
00:00:26.180 - 00:00:27.192, Speaker A: Stream is up.
00:00:27.286 - 00:03:08.180, Speaker B: It just wait a couple minutes. Looks like the trickling of people has slowed down enough. You want to get started? No, as soon as I say that, more people join. All right. Sergey, are you there? There we go. Awesome. Cool.
00:03:08.180 - 00:03:41.612, Speaker B: Well, thanks, everybody, for attending. Welcome to the AMA with the one inch team. So today we've got Sergey and Jessica from their side. Sergey is one of the co founders. This is the first time we've ever had 1inchh sponsor one of our events, but definitely not one of the first time we've seen 1inchh at one of our events. So we're definitely going to talk about that. But yeah, really excited to be working with them in such a big way for the first time and to have them kind of go full cycle from project to sponsors.
00:03:41.612 - 00:03:43.696, Speaker B: So we're 100% going to be talking.
00:03:43.718 - 00:03:44.656, Speaker A: About this for most of the things.
00:03:44.678 - 00:03:54.036, Speaker B: So I don't want to spoil it too much, but yeah. Big thank you for everybody who's here. And big thank you for taking the time, Sergey, to chat with us. Looking forward to it.
00:03:54.218 - 00:03:56.310, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Nice to be here.
00:03:57.320 - 00:04:27.570, Speaker B: Awesome. So, yeah, maybe we jump into it. I normally like to kind of talk a little bit about sort of the beginning time, so before the kind of current thing you're working on. So would love to kind of get a sense of what were you doing before you started 1inchh and sort of what were you sort of thinking about what kind of problems or kind of what led up to the founding of 1inchh? And we could talk about the founding in a minute, but kind of curious about the stuff that happened before.
00:04:28.900 - 00:05:23.040, Speaker A: So what we did before, fundamentally, with my co founder, is we had our own channel on YouTube, and what we did was security audits on live streams. We just discovered new smart contracts where a lot of people put it a lot of money. It was back in 2018, and most of these smart contracts were scams. We tried to explain the people they shouldn't invest in such a scam. We discovered backdoors and bugs in such smart contracts and show it publicly. We teach the people to read the code, to not trust, just because it is just a smart contract. So you should understand that it's dangerous to put money into not audit smart contracts.
00:05:24.500 - 00:05:43.480, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. So that was when you guys were working on the cryptomaniacs channel, right? And yeah, I mean, the first time we met, obviously, was at an ETH Global event, so maybe I'm kind of curious about sort of when did you first hear about these hackathons, the series of events, and what was your first one that you attended?
00:05:47.100 - 00:06:45.260, Speaker A: I heard from ETH Global, from Anton, and he actually is kind of old hacker guy who participated multiple times already. In Russia, he won like 50K over overnight on one of those hackathons. And one day back in 2018, he asked me may I would join a trip to Singapore. Singapore, it was great. So we had really long flight, but it was really great. So we just won three sponsor prizes and found out that oh shit, we can do it every month, participate on every ETH Global hackathon and just try to get a bounty. And it was really that we participated every month on ETH Global hackathon around the globe.
00:06:45.260 - 00:07:10.020, Speaker A: And I stopped count all the hackathons which we participated. And it was not about money, it was like about fun and the experience. We learned a lot from the hackathons, how to deliver fast and really high quality, how to pitch. And based on this experience we were able to build our startup.
00:07:11.720 - 00:07:59.488, Speaker B: From my point of so yeah, so Singapore was your first one. I remember that event was we we had unlimited beer everywhere, which was pretty awesome. And it was just mean a really great environment, even though it was a bit of a smaller event, it was awesome. Okay, so then you did a whole bunch of other ones in between and then I'm getting to the most kind of relevant one which was ETH New York. So Singapore was I think December of 2018 and then ETH New York, the first one was in May of 2019, so not that long after, only about five months. So of course New York is where kind of the idea and kind of the birth of one inch protocol was. So we'll have to kind of talk about sort of what that experience was like building that project.
00:07:59.488 - 00:08:07.030, Speaker B: And I guess did you always know that this was going to be a big thing? Was it just a fun thing you were building and what was that experience like?
00:08:08.040 - 00:09:46.772, Speaker A: So we actually didn't really know what we should build on ETH New York. Normally our approach was to just come to the hackathon, fill the hackathon, speak with everyone and with every sponsor and then we thought what we can build. So in New York I was speaking with Vitalik a little bit with Hayden Adams and I shared the idea which I got about kind of the app which would offer you all the different DEXes so you shouldn't waste your time to find the best price. And then in the middle of the hackathon we found out with Anton that we can actually use the approaches from Arbitrage trading which we implemented in our Arbiter Sport. We were playing like month before with really very efficient Arbiter sport and we used the gas token there and we implemented own logic to discover all the liquidity. And on the hackathon we thought why not also split among all the DEXes at the end, combine all these small liquidity pools into a single one and provide the best price. Because if you swap more you get worth a price.
00:09:46.772 - 00:10:21.820, Speaker A: If you swap little bit everywhere, then you have better price. I didn't sleep over two nights, so I wake up at Friday morning and on Sunday, 06:00 06:00 p.m.. I was in bed and in the between. We didn't sleep. It was crazy. So at the end I lost my orientation already, but I was able to pitch. It was actually okay, but not my best pitches.
00:10:21.820 - 00:10:47.944, Speaker A: Had to pitch to two teams and one team was really amused. The other team didn't understand, I guess because of my bad English. And we actually won only $300 from ENS. I was happy that I was able to pay for my airplane ticket. One inch was born. We actually solved a problem. We found it out after the hackathon that we really solved the problem.
00:10:47.944 - 00:10:52.330, Speaker A: And yeah, we just continued to continue to work on that.
00:10:52.860 - 00:11:19.532, Speaker B: Awesome. No, I think it's a great story. I remember, I think maybe around one or 02:00 A.m. On maybe the Saturday night, you explaining to me what you had been building and I remember being like, I'm not really sure what's going on here, but best of luck. And I mean, it's funny that you even notice, especially that 1inchh, despite being this massive platform and what it is now, it didn't actually win the event. Right. It wasn't one of the finalists.
00:11:19.532 - 00:11:59.890, Speaker B: And I think that that goes to show that even if you do build something that isn't maybe one of the finalist projects, doesn't mean it won't be successful long term. Right? I mean, those prizes are sort of, in a way, pretty arbitrary. So really it's about continuing to work on the problem. Right? And then I think kind of afterwards I don't know if this is necessarily true or not, but I know obviously you kept coming back to these events and I think I saw you in Boston and a couple other events. So were you sort of iterating on sort of the 1inchh idea at events still and sort of like, how did you know to carry on this idea rather than some of the other things you'd worked?
00:12:00.900 - 00:13:08.470, Speaker A: So actually, yeah, we continued to participate on the hackathons because we had also other ideas. So in South Africa, we have built decentralized streaming platform with micro payments, with Raiden networks. So you had to pay for each kilobyte and if you best quality, you pay a lot. And we had some other things like GDI and some other but this was like something what we just wanted to build. We had the idea and it was like funny, it was cool and in peril we had 1inchh, and we had normal jobs until early this year or summer this year. And we were working in the night on 1inchh just to improve that because we got feedback from the community. And I love the Ethereum community because it's next year to you.
00:13:08.470 - 00:13:27.710, Speaker A: It's almost everywhere. And we got direct feedback that, oh, it's a cool thing. Yeah, some of the users start to use that. We saw some traffic and we started to improve that because all the users started to use it. It was great, awesome.
00:13:29.040 - 00:14:15.710, Speaker B: And then, yeah, I would love to kind of talk about sort of the users starting to use it. Right. There was definitely a period where all of a sudden I think one of the nice things about your experience also has been that I think it's kind of been like a very gradual sort of approach, but then it got kind of crazy for a while. Right. I'd love to kind of know as you were going through the crazy part and hundreds of millions of dollars been going through kind of the 1inchh protocol. What was that like? Was that exciting? Was it terrifying? Were you building new things as fast as you could? What was that period of time like? I mean, you're really much still in that period of time, but I guess kind of very curious about what it's like to work on a protocol that's been so successful so quickly.
00:14:16.800 - 00:15:20.400, Speaker A: Yeah, the direction from my side and Anton was like, we wake up and have seen a lot of volume and it was crazy. Overnight we got much more volume and then next day, much more and more. Every week we doubled our volume. Every month we doubled our volume. And it's unbelievable in the first hours, first days, but then you recognize that it's cool, it's there, and I wish to keep it and I wish to improve. That what we do and also deliver best user experience and yeah, it's a good feeling. It's a good feeling.
00:15:22.260 - 00:16:14.610, Speaker B: Cool. Awesome. And then I kind of want to talk about one last hackathon related thing, which was what you guys built at Hack Money, right? The cheat token in May of this year, I guess at that point, 1inchh had still been doing really well, like doubling volume all the time. It was crazy at that point already, right, and yet you still decided to attend the hackathon and build something for the event. Maybe just kind of would love to know a little bit about why you love doing these hackathons so much. Right? I mean, it seems like I think you and Anton in particular are probably our biggest building supporters. What's your big draw for these events? Why is it so important to you that you attend and create something cool every time?
00:16:15.380 - 00:17:18.644, Speaker A: This is the feeling which you get when you not sleep, like two days at one piece and you deliver MVP in the best case, and you pitch that and you present your idea. And in a traditional world, in different software companies, if you have an idea, you have months, maybe almost a year to implement almost working solution. And here you deliver very fast. You have to be very efficient. And the competition feeling that there are also other people who compete with you for those sponsor prizes and also main price. Actually, our main goal was to get at least one Ethereum Global main stage price. We were really working very hard to get it.
00:17:18.644 - 00:18:02.980, Speaker A: So we needed like eight months to just get the first Ethereum Global main price. Most of the reasons are the filling, the competition filling and we keep it here and what we do right now. So we are well funded, but still I don't sleep, like also it happens that I don't sleep days here and have to deliver also with my guys together and almost all our guys also hackathon guys, also Ethereum Global winners and so on. We love to be hackers and builders.
00:18:03.800 - 00:18:58.150, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. I know you did eventually win as a finalist and I was very excited for you and I think that was just a great thing. Yeah, I think one question that comes to mind is I'd love to kind of get your take on how important user experience is in DeFi especially and within crypto. I remember I think joking with you at one of the events that you're the only app that ever is ever presented that has a dark mode switch on right like that, that is one of the most important pieces that you put into it every time just to make sure dark mode is available. I'd love to kind of talk about sort of what your thoughts are on user experience and how important that is and maybe some of the decisions that 1inchh makes in that regard that you think is helpful towards its success.
00:19:00.060 - 00:19:53.704, Speaker A: Yeah, my first steps in Ethereum, they were really terrible. Based on the user experience, I didn't understood what the fuck is MetaMask and what should I do with that, should it work? So I had the luck that had Anton also in a development. So I'm a software engineer and software architect since 15 years, like 15 years professional experience. I didn't see never such an approach with this web3 and so on, but it was really interesting. It was like, okay, I see here is really no user experience. Almost no. And we want also to improve that.
00:19:53.704 - 00:20:35.430, Speaker A: So our UI is improved by the time and first it was really terrible and then we improved that and improved that and this dark mode. So no one used this dark mode. And I like this dark mode thing and we introduced it in 1inchh and I use it everywhere on every hackathon because it looks better. And yeah, we tried also to improve the UI. You see there a lot of projects now have really great UI and also improve the space. We hope to get more users on board.
00:20:36.760 - 00:21:15.568, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I agree. The UI aspect in particular I think is very important and I feel like 1inchh was like one of the you've always been very focused on making sure that the use of the product makes sense, that things just make sense from the get go and that are well communicated. And I think that's really important. And I just want to highlight that about kind of all the projects I've ever seen you build. No matter if it was built in 24 hours or one inch over now many months, it's always been sort of very well UI and then with really great process. So yeah, just wanted to highlight that.
00:21:15.568 - 00:21:33.560, Speaker B: Okay. It looks like there was a question from the audience, from Valava on YouTube. She asked Sergey any words of wisdom for people wanting to build? I assume that means on ETH or in the ethereum space, what helped you figure out which direction to go with one inch?
00:21:40.220 - 00:21:53.070, Speaker A: Yeah, which so how we came to all the ideas is actually initially.
00:21:55.410 - 00:21:55.822, Speaker B: We.
00:21:55.876 - 00:22:25.446, Speaker A: Started to build one inch. For example, for us, like Anton said multiple times, it's really terrible. I have here like 100 ether to swap and it's really terrible to find a place where I get the best rate and we actually build it for us. And the end, it was like for everyone. The first part of the question, I didn't get it. And we also did some for Ppls, I think.
00:22:25.468 - 00:22:33.820, Speaker B: What means yeah, I think it's similar to what you just described, which is build something that you want to use.
00:22:35.790 - 00:22:57.140, Speaker A: That's exactly. That what you would use if you build something, give your friend, if you've worked together with co founder, for example, like I with Anton, give your co founder to test it, to use that and you will get a lot of feedback, I'm pretty sure.
00:22:58.390 - 00:23:09.670, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Get your friends, get your co founder, get everybody to give it a try. Exactly. Cool. Looks like there's another question, which is are you participating in the current hackathon?
00:23:11.290 - 00:23:11.858, Speaker A: Yes.
00:23:11.964 - 00:23:19.610, Speaker B: As a sponsor. Yeah, exactly. And have you seen any of the current projects already? And if so, what are your impression?
00:23:20.590 - 00:24:00.280, Speaker A: So I have seen only one project, but I didn't dive deep into it. I had really less time, but I will take time very soon to discover everything what was built. I hope there are a lot of projects who use our APIs or Smart contracts. So we love to see more people building on top of Money Legos. What we produce is not an ecosystem, not loss thing. We actually produce Money Legos and feel free to use it and benefit from that.
00:24:02.650 - 00:24:10.700, Speaker B: Definitely. What about maybe a flip to that question? If you were able to participate as a hacker, what do you think you would be building for this event?
00:24:13.070 - 00:24:54.700, Speaker A: That's a good question. This that's difficult to answer right now. So I had the idea also already on Singapore, here in Singapore to write a decentralized on. Of course there's status there, but it feels like closed system. I would love to build really similar to Money Lego. Also, like a component which can be used everywhere. And this is like decentralized chat system.
00:24:57.150 - 00:25:08.400, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an idea for sure. Okay, cool. Another question from YouTube. Did you meet your co founder Anton at a hackathon or I guess how did you meet before?
00:25:10.610 - 00:25:51.398, Speaker A: I was introduced to Anton from a good friend of Anton. They moved to Germany, where I'm from and to the city. And I met him through my wife, and his wife had contact, and we met some days. And I was trying to talk with him about crypto, about ethereum. And some other kinds. And they said I am not really interested, but I have a friend. He talks to me similar like you do and they talk all the time about crypto.
00:25:51.398 - 00:26:25.080, Speaker A: So I will introduce you. And I didn't speak with Anton a lot, just wrote a little bit and like half year later they joined my YouTube stream about the audit. I actually started by myself to just discover and try to decompile some smart contracts and he joined and after that we didn't leave YouTube for like half a year. Almost every day. Security Audits we did more than 100 security audits and live streams over two 3 hours.
00:26:26.250 - 00:26:37.340, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah, that channel was very prolific and I remember you guys recording during all of our different events as well.
00:26:38.430 - 00:26:48.510, Speaker A: I have some videos from New York so we may can use this for a documentary movie someday.
00:26:49.730 - 00:27:36.160, Speaker B: Yeah, that would be awesome. Okay, cool. And then let me see, I guess maybe one last question from my end and then we'll see if anybody else has any last questions. But Thursday is going to be the deadline for this event so I guess this would be typically when you start your project, but for everybody who's going to be kind of finishing their projects on Thursday, what advice would you have for kind of people that are looking to continue? Right? Basically should they continue, who should they talk to? What advice would you give to basically somebody who's in your position who built some kind of one inch thing of their own and are thinking about whether or not they should keep building it.
00:27:36.930 - 00:28:49.598, Speaker A: So I can say keep working, keep going and improve what you have built and try to get in touch with the community. It's not about to bring someone to shill your project, it's more about to present it, show it, pitch it and keep working on that. And of course I know how difficult it is in the last 15 years, what I did, I had my normal job and I had my own company where it was like a sandbox after 09:00 p.m. Until twelve I was working on something, I was trying something. Last twelve months was really hard for us, really less sleep. I had to perform on normal job, I had also to perform in my side project. But if you keep working you will.
00:28:49.624 - 00:29:01.822, Speaker B: Have success for sure. Awesome. Great. And congrats on being able to take that side project and make it the full time thing. That's the dream, right? That's the goal.
00:29:01.986 - 00:29:10.810, Speaker A: That's really the dream. Yeah. It's still unbelievable for us to live the dream now.
00:29:10.880 - 00:29:17.118, Speaker B: We're really excited for you over on the ETH global side, so congrats. That's really awesome. Yeah.
00:29:17.204 - 00:29:43.220, Speaker A: Thank you, guys for super organized and very helpful events. Not just for networking, also for personal growth, like, also skills and development and everything. Every event around the globe was really great. Organized and well done. Great people and the communities also.
00:29:44.010 - 00:30:08.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I appreciate that. I think it really comes down to the community and being able to have smart people anywhere and people who want to build, so can't do it without everybody else on this call. Awesome. Maybe we'll wrap it up here. It was great chatting again. Good to see you again. And of course, a big thank you to one inch, both for Sergey for coming here for the conversation, and, of course, as a sponsor.
00:30:08.730 - 00:30:26.500, Speaker B: It's a very small club of companies who have started at a global event and then have been sponsored an event. So we're really, like I said, excited for you guys to be able to be able to do that and look forward to seeing continued success for everything that you're working on.
00:30:27.350 - 00:30:28.194, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:30:28.392 - 00:30:32.130, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, thanks, everybody, and catch you on discord.
00:30:32.870 - 00:30:34.910, Speaker A: Thanks. Bye.
