00:00:05.930 - 00:00:18.910, Speaker A: One thing that I love about Youth Global is it really is all about having fun. It's about really exploring what's out there, being able to talk to everyone and really mingle. Coming back here has been extremely re energizing.
00:00:20.850 - 00:00:38.040, Speaker B: Just very happy to see that, you know, the ecosystem seems to have fully recovered from COVID Lots of people are happily going around and talking about things, hacking on things, thinking about what they're going to be building. I hope everyone enjoys the event. I think it's going to be great.
00:00:45.850 - 00:00:54.000, Speaker C: I love ETH Global. I've been doing ETH Global hackathons since 2017, and I'm a big fan of the enabling space it is.
00:01:00.850 - 00:01:01.262, Speaker A: Here.
00:01:01.316 - 00:01:18.962, Speaker D: It seems like in Web three that the people standing at the booths are like the founders, the CEOs, the people in charge of the company. It's really exciting to be able to actually talk and interact with these people. And they seem really interested in onboarding more developers. So that's probably my main takeaway. It's incredible to meet so many cool people here.
00:01:19.016 - 00:01:49.920, Speaker E: I feel like every time we attend an E Global hackathon, it's just amazing and mind blowing, and developers love it and we just want to be part of that ecosystem, part of that energy. The environment at ETH Amsterdam is just wonderful. Everything is buzzing. It has a chill vibe as well. You can definitely sense just like the creativity that is just coming together here at the event. Hackers from all around the world, 56 countries, are here to connect, develop, build amazing projects. And I think that that energy is something that you want to be a part of.
00:01:54.050 - 00:02:30.502, Speaker F: The hackathons are a weekend event where people can come and get paired up with a team if they don't already know. People just spend the time in the coworking space and get to work together. And at the end you have judges who are really supportive and people who've been in the ecosystem building and get to kind of give feedback on the project. And I think it's just a really collaborative process. Through the entire time. I think this is probably the highest quality group of hacks on teams I've seen through East Global. It just is so impressive.
00:02:30.502 - 00:02:35.050, Speaker F: Many of these are very practical that can be used today. So really amazing project.
00:02:35.200 - 00:02:44.602, Speaker C: East Amsterdam this year has been really good on the projects that I've seen around. A lot of projects that are making it much easier to get into Web Three and to make Web Three more accessible.
00:02:44.666 - 00:02:55.780, Speaker D: It's been amazing. There's been five of us and we've worked for the whole weekend, 36 hours, and we're absolutely exhausted. But yeah, just had a lot of fun. That's probably the main thing.
00:03:00.650 - 00:03:15.420, Speaker E: You what keeps me here and keeps me energized is the fact that everyone's just willing to teach and there's so many people just willing to learn. And if you come with that approach, I think that you will definitely find a welcome, warm, receptive community waiting for you.
00:03:19.950 - 00:03:30.400, Speaker G: Being in this experience where everything is organized for you, done for you, people are there to help from different teams, from different organizations. This vibe of actually being in web3 is just amazing.
00:03:35.330 - 00:03:48.614, Speaker H: You really make them feel like they belong and that they can do a lot more than they thought they could is kind of the hope for all of our events. We're doing 17 events this year, and I can't wait to see what that.
00:03:48.652 - 00:03:58.770, Speaker A: Looks like the year afternoon.
