00:00:03.370 - 00:00:50.858, Speaker A: Okay. And we're starting. So, yeah, the first team that we're going to have in is called Team Fund the restaurants. And I think Rochelle is letting them in now. And then once they're all ready to go, we should be able to let them present Song and Mohammed. Do you guys know you got there? I'm here. Yeah.
00:00:50.858 - 00:01:30.010, Speaker A: I can start. Yes, whenever you're ready. You said I fund the restaurant, right? Yep. Okay, I'll show. My name is Son and I'm a full stack developer. I built this application called Fondo Restaurant, which is a DAP that allows customers to donate funds to the restaurants. So right now, many restaurants are losing revenue because of the pandemic.
00:01:30.010 - 00:02:19.330, Speaker A: They don't have much customer like they used to and they are behind on their rents. And also they have to spend more money for clean products such as hand sanitizer and face masks. So the solution is to have a compounding for the restaurants and customers. They can donate eve to the restaurants and restaurant owners can create a post to promote their restaurants. Then they can also post what they need and it's time for the demo. Okay, so here's the DAP. Right now you're seeing this are restaurants where the owner needs fundings.
00:02:19.330 - 00:03:30.232, Speaker A: And let's say you want to create a post so you can request fundings if you're the owner. So you will click on Add Restaurant and enter the information and and then the location of your restaurants, maybe for customer to visit you're, maybe picture of your restaurants and how much you need and the descriptions of why you need these fundings. Um, create, then confirm. And there it is. The restaurant is created. And let's say if you're a customer and you want to support the restaurant, but first I will change it to the customer's wallet and then select the restaurant you want to donate. So donate to Drones Dinner and then this is how much that the owner needs.
00:03:30.232 - 00:04:36.300, Speaker A: And then you click on donate and enter the amount 150 e and then confirm it. Okay, so as you can see, the amount that this restaurant owner needs even down to 150. And here's the donation bar where you can see who donated to this special owner. And that's it for this demo. We'll go back to the slide. So in feature developments, I will implement credit delegation or rational using Ave so the restaurant owners can borrow money and maybe the customer, they can earn interest when they deposit funds. And I will also implement gas station network to cover their gas fee and then also allow customers to donate with Bitcoin, dow or other cryptocurrency instead of just ETH.
00:04:36.300 - 00:05:04.786, Speaker A: And that's it. Thank you for watching and I will see you next time. Yes. That's all I got. It seems like a very forkable thing in the first place, right? You could fork this thing. It's specifically being used for restaurants right now, but you could fork this into any kind of patreon style or even just like a shopping cart page. Right.
00:05:04.786 - 00:05:36.654, Speaker A: It's very close to I put a list of things in and someone comes in and pays ETH for those things. You've got that patreon limit there. The stuff that you mentioned at the very end was the most exciting stuff to me. Like the credit delegation stuff that seems like perfect for this. Or even just like RDAI. Like the kind of like yield redirection where someone could lock up money in favor of the restaurant and the yield could flow to the restaurant, but then they could pull their funds back and maybe by doing that they get some cool incentive to come visit the restaurant when things open up. Right.
00:05:36.654 - 00:06:17.740, Speaker A: You can have that log on chain and you can audit that they were there. Good job. Great forkable project. Something along the same line. I wanted to say it's missing a very low hanging fruit, which is something for the donor to get some sort of receipt from his donation. So let's say eventually the pandemic goes away and restaurants can resume their businesses without basing their revenue on donations. And it would be nice that those that were on the bad times get some sort of batch or something or just mention because right now you can't put your name or anything.
00:06:17.740 - 00:06:57.050, Speaker A: So something for tracking who has donated seems to be something fundamental. This is really nice. I also enjoyed the presentation. I think it's really generalizable, as Austin just mentioned. I was wondering whether maybe you would also want to add at some point or you were thinking of creating maybe some more involved incentive mechanisms where people would maybe benefit who are like the first donators. Maybe they or some have projects would maybe show up earlier or more prominent on the page or just some kind of curation market type of thing. Whether this was a consideration.
00:06:57.050 - 00:07:41.374, Speaker A: Yeah, I tried to do dedication, but I couldn't get to work. Well, it's only about time for you to get the knowledge for adding those more advanced features. Okay. Yeah. Also I was thinking about doing loaning restaurants. They can borrow more money if they have more customers using buying something from their product, using transferring to the wallet. Your team, is it a party of two or is it only yourself? Okay.
00:07:41.374 - 00:08:03.974, Speaker A: I thought I don't know why I thought there was someone else. I confused. Hopefully this has been a nice experience for you to pursue a career on this space. Yeah, thank you. And to dig into that some more. Think of a fork, think of a new direction to take this. Look at what you can fork this into and turn this into something new.
00:08:03.974 - 00:08:35.550, Speaker A: So many times I found myself learning in the space just by making something, then making something new and then making a new thing. It takes a long time to get traction and keep going and keep building. And this will be a great space for this kind of innovation. Okay. And it's also a great time now to be involved with this kind of crowdfunding and donation project. Now with the Corona situation, that's really a good spot to be in now with this. Thanks, song.
00:08:35.550 - 00:08:55.154, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone. Cool. Awesome. Thanks so much. Next up, believe we have another team by the name awesome Pensions, and I believe that is Tony, who's in the room. Yeah. Yes, sir.
00:08:55.154 - 00:09:21.360, Speaker A: So, yeah, take it away. Okay. Will you be playing the video for me, or I can play it over here? It's not a problem. I have a note saying we're playing the video. Let me just check with Rochelle if she's on top of that. 1 second. Sorry.
00:09:21.360 - 00:10:09.086, Speaker A: All right. Are you able to play your video, Tony? Yeah, I can play it. It might be a bit laggy because we've got cold weather and the network has gone crazy. Got it. Okay, let's give it a try. Just a quick check. Should there be video? Should there be audio? So far, something we don't think about until we're replaced by somebody much younger with back to back crises, layoffs, and bills that just need to be paid and age all coming at the same time.
00:10:09.086 - 00:10:50.620, Speaker A: What are you going to do? TikTok? That's right. You are going to get an awesome pension. Yes, awesome. Totally. So what's an awesome pension? Well, to help you out, let's start with normal pension, usually 40 years in length, and if you're lucky, 5% return on your 100K part per month. If you're lucky, if you're late, you have to pay 145,000 per month only to get a measly 23,000 per year. That's just not awesome.
00:10:50.620 - 00:11:56.560, Speaker A: Awesome Pensions, we're here to help you out with more people working in the gig economy and not having the ability to save. We have three great products our Standard Class, which reduces your pension time down to a mere 20 years, our Premier Class and our Defiant Class, all of which perform better than your standard high street pension. With our Standard Class, you simply pay your premium. You can upgrade to any of the other two classes, and if you don't like the policy, you can simply cancel it. Everything is done on the ethereum blockchain. With our Standard Class, you also have the ability to monitor the elapsed time, so how much time you've been paying it, see how full your pot is, understand your average interest, how much money you have left to pay, and how many payments you've made on time. So as you keep yourself on track now, that's awesome.
00:11:56.560 - 00:12:24.950, Speaker A: We are awesome. Pensions that's an awesome video. Awesome pitch. Yeah. Thank you. We got to dig into the technical stuff, though. Tell me how it works underneath, right? What does the contract do? So what the contract does is that it's a very straightforward contract.
00:12:24.950 - 00:13:12.540, Speaker A: It basically allows you to well, it uses a gateway pattern, so you buy yourself a pension paying over Ethereum and the UI. And then what happens is that it creates a specific policy just for you. And that policy has its own pot. And that pot basically uses a strategy service that basically tells it here's an investment scheme. You invest in this currency this time in this pot, in AV for this long. And then the thing is that it'll come back, make your 2% and then keep that compounding for the whole period. So as soon as you've bought it and put the money in it's already started earning for you using the D five protocols at the back.
00:13:12.540 - 00:14:49.030, Speaker A: And basically it uses I think it's one inch for I think it was for currency, chain link was for pricing, one inch was for swaps. That was it because you have to switch between different currencies in AV, have different earning rates so we have to do the switch for that because AV doesn't natively support being able to just swap between different currencies and so on. Is there some dynamic management of the funds or you just set the policy at the beginning and then it would stay like this or would it change maybe later? No, the policy basically we have like a diamond which pulls your policy and then that basically just gives you the execution thread because I'm still trying to figure out how we can efficiently do execution threads in blockchain. It's a bit of a problem for me and basically what that does is that once the policy gets that it then goes to the strategy service and says, hey, what's the best thing happening right now that's going to give me 2% of my money as quickly as possible? Because the goal of the business model is basically to earn 2% per month on whatever you put in. Ideally if you keep it at that $50 every month, by the end of it, 20 years later you should be able to earn a nice healthy five k a month which means you will definitely be able to retire. That's really nice, I like that. So the strategy is basically set based on the policy then.
00:14:49.030 - 00:15:26.214, Speaker A: Yeah. Any other questions? I want to dig into the tech even more. You've kind of mentioned one inch, you've mentioned Chain Link for your Oracles. I think you even mentioned that you're using the diamond standard or there's Facets, there, there's a ton of tech there. I wasn't sure if that's what you were saying. Can we get link to the repo? So normally what I'd like to see is like a demo where I get to get in, click in and do this stuff like send my pension or send like a fake pension where I send one every 15 seconds or something like that to see it. I want to get my hands on it.
00:15:26.214 - 00:15:47.230, Speaker A: So definitely if you could send us a link or give us something that we can interact with or a repo that we can play with. I think that's the key here. Yeah. Still work in progress, right? But yeah, I can get a link sent over. Yeah, it's not a problem. And I think a key here is like, keep going, keep building. Keep iterating.
00:15:47.230 - 00:16:09.254, Speaker A: I just said this, and I feel like I'm going to say this a million times, but throw things away. Build things. Throw things away. Build things. Expand, reduce. This kind of process in this space takes a while, and it may take a while to get someone to click. What you're describing is something awesome that people want to use, but we just need to have something to play with and use, too, right? We need that front end.
00:16:09.254 - 00:16:34.510, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I mean, that's absolutely great. I appreciate that, because in terms of the application, I was really looking at the ladies in the market. They can save $50, they can't give you $300 a month. And a lot of people, gig workers, they're running into this problem. And it's not a problem that's going to hit you tomorrow. It's a problem that hits you when you can't work no more.
00:16:34.510 - 00:17:04.010, Speaker A: And so the goal is to make sure that this project does see the light of day and it does get out there, and I will get you some testnet deployed contracts, and then you can tell me and give me some advice in terms of how to make it much better. Heck, yeah. Well, thanks so much, man. It's great. Thank you. Cool. So next up, I believe Xavier.
00:17:04.010 - 00:17:17.040, Speaker A: Jack kevin. In here. Team Haciendas. So are you guys here? You ready to go? Yep. We're going to share the screen and play the demo video. Sounds good. Take it away.
00:17:17.040 - 00:18:03.304, Speaker A: Can you guys see the screen? Yep. Are you new to DeFi and finding you have no clue how to make a transaction? Do you find it hard to wrap your head around token swap and liquidity pools? It's so confusing, it's even being called weird DeFi. No one really knows what's going on. You're not alone in being confused, and Haciendas is here to help. At Haciendas, we're on a mission to make DeFi more accessible and fun for new users with an interactive game. As it is now, innovations in DeFi often come with clumsy interfaces, complex lingos, confusing metrics, and opaque backend processes. So how can we make a smooth transition from conventional finance into DeFi? Haciendos is the game we are building to do just that.
00:18:03.304 - 00:18:37.620, Speaker A: It's easy to learn and fun to play with. The goal of making players comfortable with DeFi protocols. Here, we will take you on a fun and interactive guide tour to swap, deposit, borrow, and stake. You can select your character and meet other characters in the game. Discovering DeFi protocols doesn't have to be lonely anymore. You can meet and chat with other Defiers and make a few friends along the way. In the game, you have assets stored in your inventory, use them to deposit, swap, transact and borrow.
00:18:37.620 - 00:19:31.914, Speaker A: Not only can you see how many tokens you have by opening the inventory, you can also drag them around for making real world transactions. Not only can you chat with other players, but you can also transact with them using real cryptocurrencies. You can send money to artists, your friends, family, or anyone else in the game you'd like. If you'd like to exchange your tokens for some other coin, you can go visit the market and swap out ETH for Dai or several other coins, all without leaving the game. We've leveraged the power of one inch exchange so you can easily exchange your coins for others with the least hassle possible. Giving players the chance to make real transactions without leaving the gameplay will remove friction from the transaction experience. Ociendos integrates with Advanced Functionalities to help users learn to use liquidity pools.
00:19:31.914 - 00:20:22.400, Speaker A: The liquidity pools are represented in a visual way, so it's easy for users to understand the process. For example, you can deposit your tokens into Ave liquidity pools and borrow from the loan officer. You can also enter the Aave Governance building. Once greeted by this cute little ghost, you can read ongoing proposals and discuss them in the appropriate room with other players. Players can even vote on proposals from the game. We believe removing friction from this process will encourage greater participation in the voting. We hope this video made you want to learn more about the exciting world of DeFi, and we're happy you're starting your journey with us.
00:20:22.400 - 00:20:32.480, Speaker A: Give me the website. I want to go play it right now. Send me the link.
00:20:35.970 - 00:20:39.730, Speaker B: The link is project dashboard.
00:20:43.350 - 00:20:45.300, Speaker A: Amazing. So it's live?
00:20:46.070 - 00:20:49.480, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. You can play with it.
00:20:52.170 - 00:21:24.018, Speaker A: What's the um I will post it. Amazing project, by the way. So I remember ETH New York. I don't even know when it was one of the ETH New York's a couple years ago. A year ago, the Flex DAPs guys basically Gamified taking out a loan from compound and it just made it way more fun. It got a lot more interaction and that's exactly what you've done here. Times like Zelda, which is so freaking cool.
00:21:24.104 - 00:21:24.498, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:21:24.584 - 00:21:24.834, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:24.872 - 00:22:09.070, Speaker B: The idea is to make it fun enjoying real world metaphors to make this abstract concept more tangible for people who aren't used to DeFi. So this target audience is really like a very large sort of people who are new to DeFi. People who have interacted maybe with the wallet, but not quite proficient in using staking or borrowing this more advanced features and introducing them to tokens like Governance tokens on Ave and things like that. So it's bridging that gap between legacy apps and conventional banking systems and this very abstract DeFi layer.
00:22:09.970 - 00:22:18.900, Speaker A: It's really cool. So I'm wondering which of those features or use cases was the most difficult to explain or convey gamified way to people.
00:22:19.910 - 00:23:01.230, Speaker B: Liquidity pools are definitely more challenging to explain. And I think having this what we design is a liquidity pool, like literally a pool, the token swimming around. So kind of drawing a metaphor, like dropping your tokens in the pool and then taking some other coins out, I think that really explains what happens on the back end, because right now, all the DApps have zero sort of system feedback on what's going on after you send something. Even when I go on ave, I deposit some dai. I don't really know what's going on. So I think having that visual feedback is really important for raising the confidence in new users.
00:23:01.650 - 00:23:08.340, Speaker A: So that's really good. Your tokens now then inside the pool, like swimming around or something, you can fish them out.
00:23:10.070 - 00:23:16.290, Speaker B: Well, there's a loan officer standing by the pool, so they wouldn't let you just to jump in a pool and take things out without permission.
00:23:18.790 - 00:23:45.982, Speaker A: Do you have plans for continuing this? Because it could be fun. There are so many different products that you could have a real world with tens of different scenarios and have endless fun. And I could imagine different ways to monetize this. Whether it's from incentives from the teams, there are many ways that you could monetize. So is it your plan to continue developing this?
00:23:46.116 - 00:24:00.100, Speaker B: Yeah, we're scheduling a call with Matic this week. We got their attention. So I think there's definitely plans to continue this and explore all the ways we can monetize it as well right now.
00:24:02.710 - 00:24:37.360, Speaker A: Sounds like a lot of fun. Adding L choose it's over 100 different words you could have, like, with different portals if you are on optimism and then you need to move to and of course, making it an educating experience could be very hard from a UX point of view. How do you make people have fun and learn? But if you nail it, this could be a massive onboarding tool. So I hope it goes well. 100%. And I just want to echo that. If you nail it can be so good.
00:24:37.360 - 00:25:01.814, Speaker A: This thing that is here is like a very similar thing to something that I'm spending a lot of my time working on. Also, this is really good stuff. Good work. Maybe transactions out of a pool right now. Yeah, you definitely should come talk to Austin Griffith sometime. Yeah. Austin is too humble to say, but his build thing is a nice complement of this.
00:25:01.814 - 00:25:16.700, Speaker A: Both things should totally go together. Like, if someone is getting a little more experienced, it's like the natural next step after you nail the graphic interface. So you should totally check his workout, which is ETH build.
00:25:17.790 - 00:25:20.730, Speaker B: Yeah. I found that link on your bio in your Twitter bio.
00:25:21.970 - 00:25:27.280, Speaker A: And very good luck. Hope we see this evolving in the future.
00:25:28.210 - 00:25:29.934, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you.
00:25:30.052 - 00:25:50.770, Speaker A: Thanks so much, guys. That was awesome. Looking forward to sharing this stuff on Twitter, getting more people to play around with. It also cool. Next up, let's see. Edward Amore. I believe with West Texas Oil.
00:25:50.770 - 00:26:05.046, Speaker A: Interesting. You ready to go? Yeah. Let me share my screen. Oh, man. Where's Evan Van Ness? This is perfect for Evan Van Ness. He got the wrong judge. My name is Andy Kay, and I'm part of West Texas Oil.
00:26:05.046 - 00:27:06.080, Speaker A: And we're really excited to present to you a novel solution to oil theft in West Texas. We've got a great team, and one of them actually is an industry expert in the oil and gas industry, and I'll allow Kenneth to kind of introduce the problem to you. Hello. My name is Kenneth Luster. I work in the oil and gas industry and recognize the ever increasing need for the utilization of blockchain technologies within all sectors of oil and gas. After seeing the major concern of crude oil theft within the supply chain of oil production, the solution we develop reconciles the Bill of Lading between midstream suppliers and end stream refiners from Midland, Texas, to Houston, Texas. This is our demonstration of the front end of our project.
00:27:06.080 - 00:28:19.590, Speaker A: Right now, we only have our supervisor logistics handled. And the way that a supervisor would interact with this project is they'd come over to the Add Bol view, and here they'd input the information important for creating a Bill of Lading. Some of the stuff that's already pre filled out here is the contract address of the Bill of Lading contract and the funding token contract that we're using in real life. They'd most likely use a stablecoin contract like USDC or Dai or USDT. And then before also a good thing to mention is that before actually creating the bol and coming here, they'd have to approve the Bill of Lading contract to take out a deposit amount, which we would add in the future, a field that just says Value, and they can input. Here we already have the pre filled out information. So this is the driver ethereum address that will get the Bill of Lading.
00:28:19.590 - 00:29:17.842, Speaker A: This is the serial number. And all these zeros are just the coordinates for the origin, the point of origin, and the point of destination. In the future, we'll use something like the Google Maps API to translate real life addresses to latitude and longitude and kind of like not let people deal with that messy stuff. And then lastly, the quantity of crude oil and metric tons that a driver will be taking. Once all this is filled out, the supervisor can then click Add Bol, and this will create a bol by creating a transaction. They'll click Create, Confirm, and then send that off to the blockchain. Once this is done, in the future, we hope to actually display this for our driver.
00:29:17.842 - 00:30:14.938, Speaker A: Each driver would obviously have a different view, and the way we do that is by an event within our Create Bol. As far as the next steps, we plan to implement the ERC 25 35 diamond standard to allow for upgradability integrate with third party fiat on off ramps such as wire pay drivers sooner and accrue interest on payments such as with Ave. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Thanks a lot. I think that was interesting. So I'm just wondering, this bill of lading contract, is this like a real word contract that is somehow represented now back on the blockchain, or is it like a blockchain native contract? This is an industry standard contract that's used right now. It's like handwritten.
00:30:14.938 - 00:30:46.336, Speaker A: There are a couple of different forms, but they generally contain similar criteria that kind of represent where the oil is on the supply chain. But it's quite analog right now. So this kind of digital, even like, signed messages could be really powerful here. A lot of the things that you do along the way, you can be signing with a key pair, and then that can be cryptographically checked without having to write that on chain. And that might help with your chain of things, too. Cool project, though. It's cool to see the UI.
00:30:46.336 - 00:31:19.484, Speaker A: It's cool to see you pasting addresses in there and firing off transactions. That's what I like to see. Yeah, we stumbled into some issues on the front end, and we ended up scrapping. There's quite a few days of work I put in. I got to show you scaffold ETH. I got this tool made for building front ends for web3. You know what, Mohammed? Next time we should mention hackathon, specifically Mohammed, who did the social recovery wallet, not to show a different project, but yeah, so it was really fun.
00:31:19.484 - 00:32:21.904, Speaker A: And I come from a little bit of a supply chain background, and so I see a lot of handoffs here, and it's a very high ticket industry, although it is decreasing. That just signifies to me that there does need to be optimization of your bottom line. And this is one of those things like reduce loss on the supply chain so your product is more profitable. You got to keep it above the break even, because last year oil was down to less than $0 a barrel because you had to account for storing it. So I think it's a pretty interesting industry to address this problem through. Are you also considering to have some kind of factoring in where people can get money for their bills or their like, when we're thinking big picture? Because Kenneth, he's worked in the industry for a decade, so he's seen a lot of this and he addressed so many. Like, when we're trying to do the problem solving thing, we sat out trying to solve a real world problem.
00:32:21.904 - 00:33:02.262, Speaker A: I think that's where the most interesting aspect of blockchain is for me. Not that solving like a lending protocol or something isn't a real world problem, but this is more tangible to me. So when we started addressing this, Kenneth, it was like, hey, it takes a long time for drivers to get paid. Like, sometimes three weeks. I think we might be losing you a little bit, Andy. I'll just say it's great to have people, folks that are technical like yourself, that are also very interested in ethereum, like kind of this sort of cohort kind of thing going on here. Keep building that stuff.
00:33:02.262 - 00:34:12.250, Speaker A: Something that you might find when you take on a big ambitious project like this is that there are these holes along the way that you find that if we were to fast forward to what West Texas supply chain looks like, in ten years, it's going to be different. And maybe some of the little holes that you found along the way, attack one of those little things, solve that problem first and start building these things up. So then in ten years, we've got all this stuff in line, but stick around in the ethereum community. That's my biggest shill that I will give to you. I have a little question because I don't know the industry. Are there smallish players that are willing to go and use bleeding edge technologies, or is it mainly like super big corporations that it's impossible to get them on board? So that was definitely a big concern of ours because I talked to one of my dad teaches supply chain on the East Coast, and I talked to one of his professors, and they're kind of bearish on trying to integrate it. But a lot of these are the owner operators.
00:34:12.250 - 00:34:28.614, Speaker A: The suppliers are on the smaller side. They're like mom and pots that are contracted by shell. So I do think that there's an opportunity there if we decided to prove it. But thanks so much, guys, for your time and consideration. Really appreciate it. Well, thanks, man. And one quick mini note just to what Patricio said.
00:34:28.614 - 00:35:06.514, Speaker A: I happen to know a guy who has built some relationships with BP who's trying to help BP get into this industry. And he actually has close contacts with them in such a way that they would be willing to. Actually allocate a lot of money to a project that allows them to tokenize some of the things that they're already doing, whether it's commodities, to oil or otherwise. And I always kind of thought, like, I'm not sure how this will play out, but it seems like you guys actually might be a really interesting fit to talk with this guy who seems to have all these connections, but not quite the technical expertise. But you have a lot of the technical expertise as well. So maybe DM me on discord and I can help facilitate that introduction. Same thing.
00:35:06.514 - 00:35:18.280, Speaker A: I'll throw Karen in there too. Karen Scarborough is kind of in the space, knows this kind of stuff, too. And Evan, of course, but reach out to both of us. Let's link up. Let's see what we can connect you with. Yeah, I'd love to. Thanks, guys.
00:35:18.280 - 00:35:39.100, Speaker A: Thanks, guys. All right, moving right along. So the next team up. Is nerd d five or n third? Five. I have the video Craig that off YouTube, so let me try and set that up for you. Thank you. Give me just a second here.
00:35:39.100 - 00:36:34.782, Speaker A: Open up the video file. One more second. Sorry, it's got it. Oh, there it is. Before this project, I wanted to incorporate all the things I enjoy or love about crypto and combine them into one platform. So the technologies I used were matic. I also integrated the Arcane Widget, I did a play on ARV Gotchi and I also enjoyed their anti design.
00:36:34.782 - 00:37:08.150, Speaker A: So I tried to work around something like that. I also used ARV's protocol for the A tokens and also the borrow lend functionality and also the governance. I also tried to integrate the subgraph using the Graph protocol. Here's just a view of my Arcane network wallet. So run through this is Notify. I'm just going to quickly connect my network. See, I'm not connected my wallet.
00:37:08.150 - 00:37:42.560, Speaker A: Here we go. And now I can also load up my Arcane wallet. Loading. Now my count is loaded. And here I also have a network switcher. So if I switch my network up via MetaMask, it should show that I'm now on the Coba network. So in short, Nerdify is basically ecosystem.
00:37:42.560 - 00:38:34.880, Speaker A: So firstly we have our diamond contract Nerd NFT. There's only 10,000 of these and this is styled around a crypto punk or crypto kitty that just represents my Nerd token. And then we would have Nerdy tokens, which is basically our currency to have eight but NFT platform and marketplace where you can create NFTs and sell them and stake them. And I also have my Safu vault which is basically a security system. So any monies that come in from the Nerd tokens would go into that as a security system. So with AV I was working on integrating all their coins or tokens where you could deposit borrow. And then I was going to do a flash loan system probably on the Safu protocol.
00:38:34.880 - 00:39:17.608, Speaker A: Then I was also doing a play on of Gotchi. So if you would stake Ghost for Nerdy tokens, you'd get a Nerd token in the end. Little play on that. And then I did my Sapphire protocol over here and then again just a bit on the DeFi ecosystem. And then finally my NFT marketplace which would incorporate OpenSea. So in addition to this, I also wanted to build out analytical tools more on the side of the NFT marketplace and then also do a synthetic swap, which I thought could be a cool project. Anyway, this is a short presentation on Notify.
00:39:17.608 - 00:39:41.590, Speaker A: Hope you enjoy it. Love the UI. Go ahead. Thanks. So this is really comprehensive. This seems like really encompassing the whole range of DeFi protocols that are out there. So like an integration of basically everything more or less a bit of a playground for me.
00:39:41.590 - 00:40:04.028, Speaker A: That's exactly right. It's so cool that you can extend any of these protocols, you can just permissionlessly build whatever front end you want on top of it. So what you did was like, let's make this eight bit playground, this sandbox, where there's all these buttons for all these different things you can do. You want NFTs? We got NFTs. You want to borrow? We can borrow. I love it. That's fun.
00:40:04.028 - 00:40:39.060, Speaker A: I like the interface. Go ahead. I try to put a lot of focus on the governance with it being a diamond contract and allowing you to sort of upgrade it and that type of thing. So the Sapu Protocol is sort of based around that whole governance, where you've got your sort of players in the game. And the more they're interacting, the more they're providing or getting weights in the system, giving them a sort of a higher ranking. So a different way of looking at governance sort of centralized but decentralized fashion, you can call it that. So the sort of concept would be for Safu Protocol.
00:40:39.060 - 00:41:29.044, Speaker A: The idea is that that would be like an insurance for the crypto industry, and all your bigger players would be like your Nerds. So, for example, AV would be a Nerd or Compound, and they're all sort of putting skin in the game, if you can say that. So that's why I sort of try to focus around that governance theme. So is the Nerdy Token like a governance token in the end? And can you get it through yield farming or what's the exact use case? So the Nerd Token is the NFT diamond standard, so that almost becomes your governance. The Nerdy is just like a currency. So I was sort of playing with the idea of having like a die or a currency. So I sort of looked at of Gotcha and they've got the Ghost Token, which you can stake, and then basically you get your portals or your haunts.
00:41:29.044 - 00:41:59.020, Speaker A: So I wanted something which was high in value, but could be traded and given away, if I can say that. But the actual Nerd token is your governance. Makes sense. Yeah. You have to be an actual Nerd to get a Nerd token. Well, my idea with that is it shouldn't really be based on a price, but more just one per person. So you're really almost decentralizing the platform, if I can say that fully.
00:41:59.020 - 00:42:43.232, Speaker A: A lot of guys, like if you look at hash masks, someone can go and buy ten of them and then they've almost captured the market type of thing. That's where I wanted it to be a bit more even spread. So you built out an awesome UI, you deployed an NFT, and you have something set up so people can collect the NFT. There were some smart contracts that went. But can we talk through just what was some of the hardest parts? How would you make it better for the next guy? Sure. I think the sort of one click farming and yield farming, I think there's a bit of a barrier entry there to just the normal folks. That's why I sort of wanted to make it quite easy to log into the system with arcane wallet and create a wallet if you don't have one.
00:42:43.232 - 00:43:28.572, Speaker A: So almost trying to eliminate MetaMask and that functionality if I can, and then just making it more fun and interactive. So the more you stake or do different things, you can get rewarded with NFTs and different prizes, et cetera. What about for the builder, for the guy who wants to build this next front end, build the same thing you built? What advice would you have for them? Just keep trying. Yeah, this was quite a lot of tech. So I found I sort of had to just say I've got two days for this and build what I could and then put it down and go on to the next thing. But yeah, it's not as difficult as what it seems. When you look at these different protocols, like yearn and that, and when you start to deep dive, it makes a bit more sense.
00:43:28.572 - 00:43:36.300, Speaker A: Yeah, it's good. That's awesome to hear. Stay in the space. Keep building, keep building. Excellent. Thanks. Pub graph.
00:43:36.300 - 00:44:20.610, Speaker A: Thanks, man. Thank you very much. Right on. Cool. Next up we have Team October Bay and I'm also going to play your video. Hey, do you guys have video on yourselves? Maybe you can set yourselves up while I set the video up. Just 1 second, it's not finding my quick time window second.
00:44:20.610 - 00:45:09.710, Speaker A: There we go. Okay. Hello. This is our submission. Unfortunately, it's not as much as we wished for, but we were not really 100% focused on this hackathon, to be honest, for different reasons. Mainly, I personally am just really participating to see what it's like and not really to win anything, just for the experience, so to say. Anyway, there's a little bit of code that is somehow related to what we plan to do, and that is a chainlink adapter, actually, two chainlink adapters.
00:45:09.710 - 00:45:59.280, Speaker A: One to fetch the number of followers of a given Twitter account and one to make a tweet from a Twitter account that is owned by the Oracle and that's already built into our project UI, as you can see here. This is a list of GitHub issues, some funds deposited on it, and we can post this issue to Twitter and this will be handled by an Oracle on the covent network. Now. And the idea was to make the price for posting to Twitter based on the followers of the Twitter account that is being used by the Oracle. So actually in the background, it's two Oracle requests. First the followers and then the followers. Fulfillment then triggers the actual post job.
00:45:59.280 - 00:46:39.560, Speaker A: And there it. So the oracle posted to Twitter now. And you can click this button and see the post, just the deposit size and a link to the issue on GitHub. And that's it. What we actually planned to do was a much more comprehensive notification system based on chainlink. But that certainly needs a bit more time to think about. The other thing that I did rather spontaneously now is to start implementing the graph in our project.
00:46:39.560 - 00:47:16.450, Speaker A: So there's a new subgraph for these issue bounties you just saw and you can check it out here in the explorer. Yeah, just two entities, issues and issue deposits and a little bit of code. Very simple. Still just one simple handler that loads and adds issues and then adds every new deposit. Nothing too special yet, but we will definitely work on this a lot more, I'm pretty sure, so that we can handle all sorts of nice filters or notifications or stuff like that. We'll see. But for now that's it.
00:47:16.450 - 00:48:24.498, Speaker A: Yeah, not that much, but I'm curious to see what others submit. Yeah, thanks. So you said you shined to see how it was. I guess you mean how it was to build on this stack and the tooling and the community and how you're feeling now that you have tried? Sorry, if you're talking, I think it was either very quiet or no or your mic is on and you just on I'm can you hear me? We can hear you, but I think I think your input volume is like it's like the smallest possible unit. It's like a little man in a box, like after like yeah, and that's not much better. I mean, it worked before in the other call. Wait.
00:48:24.498 - 00:48:40.650, Speaker A: Hey Mkt, it's a bit better now. Can you start over? Sorry, a little bit better? Yes. It was just perfect in the other call now, so I was a little bit confused now. Perfect now. Okay, it's quiet but we got you go. Yeah. Okay, I'll try to speak loud, as loud as I can.
00:48:40.650 - 00:49:27.530, Speaker A: So what was the first question now? Sorry, the question was you said you got into the hackathon to learn how the thing was, I guess you were meaning the tooling, the whole stack. And how are you feeling now? Do you feel like you are going to keep building on ethereum? Yeah, of course, definitely. I mean, I just personally never participated in a hackathon, so for me it's just a first time experience and as I said in this video, I'm not here to win any prizes or something, just to see how everything works and how the processes are and so on. Yeah, we will definitely continue to work on this project because it started even before the sackathon actually. You cut off the video a little bit. I mentioned in the end that what you see there, most of it was not built during the sackathon. Now.
00:49:27.530 - 00:50:33.630, Speaker A: We started actually a few months ago and we were inspired by the hackathon, just by all the topics and technologies and we came up with some ideas that we want to implement in the project and submit during the sackathon. But unfortunately we were a little bit blocked by both private issues and work related stuff and companies demanding our time and so on. So it's development wise, not that much that we can present here. Yeah, there's something cool I could share with you because I think the idea makes a lot of sense. And not only it makes sense, my project actually needed this because we give batches in the formal nonfungible tokens to people that dot to things and many times projects want to give a special token as a price for people that request. Sorry, if I may interrupt you here, but that's exactly one thing that we plan to do. So to offer an option to issue governance tokens, for example, for projects alongside with their issues and bounties and so on.
00:50:33.630 - 00:51:09.686, Speaker A: Yeah. As you for sure know, GitHub doesn't offer a way to contact a contributor directly. If the contributor doesn't have an email address, you can get in touch with them and it really sucks. But it also makes sense that they want to preserve privacy. So if there were an open source connector like yours, if it were that has product market fit, we would use it. This is kind of what we have in mind with this notification system that I mentioned that we want to use. Chainlink.
00:51:09.686 - 00:51:43.954, Speaker A: Our chainlink Oracles are basically the team that is running this decentralized app and they also will be responsible for sending all sorts of notifications via email. If there is an email, we fall back to Twitter or just simple GitHub comments mentioning users and so on. So we're trying to tackle that problem. Yeah. Yeah. If you ever get this built, feel free to reach out and maybe we can do some testing because this is a need that we want to get fulfilled as quickly as possible. It's not just a crazy idea we had.
00:51:43.954 - 00:52:35.682, Speaker A: We really want this to exist. Yeah, I mean we already have quite good feedback from several sites and everybody says that, yeah, that could be really a very much needed project or product or a tool. And we tried to focus on the simplicity and cover like 95% of the use cases and just don't think about the 5% niche use cases and something a little bit in the spirit of uniswap for GitHub issues and bounties and open source funding and so on. Yeah, so I just feel a little bit bad because it's really not something we develop now during this hackathon. We just felt inspired by the hackathon to implement a few additional features around lending, for example, like saving accounts and so on. But yeah, I have to be as honest as I can, we didn't really deliver anything. No.
00:52:35.682 - 00:52:49.530, Speaker A: Good work. You're tinkering in the right area, you're thinking about the right things. Keep hustling, keep building this stuff. Like Patricio said, there is product market fit for these ideas. Thanks a good work. Thank you. Thank you.
00:52:49.530 - 00:53:32.678, Speaker A: All right. One thing I just will emphasize also for anyone listening and also for you, Mkt, is that the prizes, of course, are for what you build at the hackathon. But the environment that the hackathon is meant to create is such that even if you just want to participate and chat with people and just learn about things and tinker with ideas or chat with interesting people, it's a very welcome and open environment for that. So I wouldn't feel bad about not necessarily having done a huge amount of the hackathon, but it's great just to have you in the community. Yeah. I just wanted to make it clear because I heard from other people that sometimes projects just don't give a shit and they submit whatever they have from a year ago or something. I just wanted to make clear that that's not the case here.
00:53:32.678 - 00:53:41.580, Speaker A: Yeah, we do do like the due diligence at the end process, but I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Cool.
00:53:41.580 - 00:54:03.042, Speaker A: All right. And shared stake. So I don't know your name because your Zoom name is the project name. Yeah. We're trying to maintain a little bit of anonymity till we get a lawyer and figure out the presentation. Go ahead. Hey there.
00:54:03.042 - 00:54:42.486, Speaker A: I'm representing sharestake. We're the easiest way to stake for E Two and earn rewards sharedstake.org. And we're live on main net and Sharestake ETH via ENS. We integrated chainlink Ave and ENS over the market made hackathon. So the main problem that we noticed was a lot of users were hesitant to stake for ethereum too, because maybe they don't have 32 E or technical expertise to do that. The APYs were also fairly low compared to kind of the Djen yield farming ecosystem that we have. And a lot of users want to maintain liquidity and some investors might actually be short ETH.
00:54:42.486 - 00:55:46.980, Speaker A: So we built a DFI compatible liquid eat staking solution for nontechnical users. Users deposit their ETH into our smart contract with the website. They get a Vs two token back, which they can use to either they can burn it and get their ETH back directly, or they can deposit that into snow swap and start earning snow rewards. And that also allows exit liquidity because there's wrapped ether on snow swap as well. In the same pool, we have close to a million deposited into the E Two contracts by Shared stake, 100 plus holders and protocol users right now, and exit liquidity that's native to our smart contract, which I haven't seen anywhere else over market make. We built a perpetual renewable merkel distributor that we plan to use for future airdrops and an ability to open a long and short position via Aave using chainlink's price feeds. So the way we integrate with Aave, this is a mock off, kind of the front end that's on a dev branch right now.
00:55:46.980 - 00:56:42.862, Speaker A: You can kind of long ETH by having ETH and using that to open a CDP, borrow a stable coin against it, buy ETH with that and then deposit that into our contract to get the APIs there. So we automated that in a smart contract and then any money that's left over is credit delegated back to the user to do with as they want. And there's also a short eat strategy that goes from a stable coin, borrows ETH and then deposits that in the contract. And again, likewise it credit delegates back to the user. Chainlink was useful for the CDP based strategies because we needed it at USD price feed and it provides that. And then we also have the fast gas function used in our smart contract, the main deposit smart contract and our token Geysers to help the front end kind of figure out good gas prices. And we have sharestate.
00:56:42.862 - 00:57:06.586, Speaker A: ETH registered. So let me jump into a quick demo here. So this is our website. It's a landing page. We mainly built most of that over this month. Well, we launched the contracts back in December with a fairly simple UI. And you can go here, you can stake your ETH into it.
00:57:06.586 - 00:57:33.330, Speaker A: We're also live on Grorly if anyone wants to test us. And if you actually have yet, you can get that back. This shows how much monies we have in the contract right now. Here's the earn page and you can go check if your address is eligible for Sgt. Mine's already claimed it. And then you can see like stats here as well. And then we have info on our notion that this will take you to.
00:57:33.330 - 00:57:45.170, Speaker A: And we also have medium Discord. So come say hi in Discord. So that's the presentation. Please check us out. Sharestake.org. Sharestake. ETH.
00:57:45.170 - 00:58:20.524, Speaker A: We're open source on GitHub and you can email us at sharestake@gmail.com. Thanks and we could use some help, so please reach out. Bye. All right, that's a presentation if anyone's got any questions to the stuff. So just really quickly, one thing when it comes to one inch specifically, they are on this Discord and they were a hackathon project at ETH Global. And so if you did need to reach out to them, they're very receptive on Discord. Oh cool, yeah, I'll reach out to them.
00:58:20.524 - 00:59:10.020, Speaker A: Thanks. Can we carve it down to just what happened for the hackathon? Just like a TLDR of just your hackathon presentation minus the full everything deposit that in. So over the hackathon, we built the landing page pretty much over this month. We got all 1000 e of deposits into our contract. We built the perpetual merkel distributor for Airdrops that we're planning to use. And we also built the Ave smart contract that opens a CDP and allows you to go long or shorty and then depositing your contract. But that is currently live on covan we're on Gorelim, so we still need to do some testing before we bring it to main net.
00:59:10.020 - 00:59:35.734, Speaker A: I mean, a merkel distributor the contract on top of Ave. Like, any of these things are hackathon projects already. So it's awesome. I think it gets you guys good exposure, but you don't need it. You've already got your thousand E. But good work and congratulations. That's 1000 E, that's going to the Et two deposit contract, right? We're just depositing that and then we're spinning up validators and we miscalculated the fees.
00:59:35.734 - 00:59:50.106, Speaker A: So we're actually like short money. We're losing money doing this project. It's great. But hopefully that'll turn around, right? Yeah, hopefully. I love the UI. That's really amazing. I think it's really original.
00:59:50.106 - 01:00:30.022, Speaker A: Like the way that those different functionalities, they slide up and you can access them. That was really original. Can you maybe tell us a little bit more about this merkel tree distributor, how that works? Technically? Absolutely. Yeah. So right now, the merkel distributors, you create a merkel route and then there's a claim bitmap in the distributor which keeps track of claims. So all we did was we allowed a way to update that. So now you can go back on chain, see who's claimed their tokens, who hasn't generated a new merkel route with your extra new AirDrop holders, plus unclaimed old AirDrop holders.
01:00:30.022 - 01:00:57.250, Speaker A: And we allowed a way to upgrade that claimed bitmap. And what we do is instead of having just the single bitmap, instead of having the single mapping, we have a mapping of mappings and we just increment the version. And this is surprisingly gas efficient. Like, instead of 60,000, it costs like 70,000. Yeah. Thanks a lot. So this is like a regular merkel tree or a patricia tree because it needs to be upgradable.
01:00:57.250 - 01:01:17.510, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so we didn't do anything because we overwrite the merkel root of the tree. Right. So we use the regular TS node merkel tree generator that Uniswap uses. So I believe it's just a regular one. Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Quick question regarding the poll, because I'm somewhat concerned.
01:01:17.510 - 01:02:09.322, Speaker A: You have taken over 1000 Ether from people and you're handling all validating duties and the contracts where you keep balances and all the positive information and such, are they open source and have they been audited? No. So we're looking for an audit right now and trying to put together the money for an audit. So they haven't been audited, but they're open source and they're verified on Ether scan as well. But this is still a very valid concern and moving down, what we're doing is a multi bond system so you can bond our token, have a certain percentage of share in the pool and bond keeper and then deploy your own validator. And also when Ethereum choose kind of like shared validator credentials and withdrawing to a contract, those things are more available. We plan to integrate that and upgrade. Thanks.
01:02:09.322 - 01:02:44.754, Speaker A: So you got people to put 1000 ETH into an unaudited contract? Yes. We didn't do anything. We just launched it and people put money in and now we're going to go figure out the audit, right? That's what I was saying with kind of right now our fees we charge 0.3% per validator so that's not really enough to get audits or anything. Yeah, let's get that figured out. Make sure reach out to some of us. If you're not able to find somebody, there's lots of auditors in the space, there's lots of people that will just give you a spot check with that much east.
01:02:44.754 - 01:03:08.810, Speaker A: That's scary. Good luck. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. Message me also I'm happy to catch you to any auditors mobile and this is our hack for Market Make 2021. So let's get started team. I'm Abiak Jen, I am the iOS Android engineer for this project and with me I have Eric who is the backend engineer.
01:03:08.810 - 01:03:30.970, Speaker A: So talking about the opportunity, coinbase mobile app has 15 million download. Look at binance 10 million downloads. That shows there's a significant demand for mobile app. But when we look at Ave solution, it is website based but it has a staggering TVL of 4.5 billion. Assuming a two x penetration, a native mobile app for Ave actually represent an opportunity for another 4.5 billion.
01:03:30.970 - 01:04:00.314, Speaker A: And that is why we have built a native iOS and Android app for Avid and it works on main net. It is not a dab browser, it's a native app. So it supports all on chain translation. We are talking about deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, switching of interest type and collateral setting. We have also integrated with one inch to support the swap services in case the user doesn't have the token which is supported by Aave. We also provide transferring and creating and importing of wallet. So the app itself is a complete solution.
01:04:00.314 - 01:04:26.742, Speaker A: It doesn't require any support from the website. Now it is built with an infinitely scalable architecture. We have built Aave rest API from scratch. Each API endpoint talk to a microservices which is also serverless and that microservice talks to the Aave smart contract and that is because everything is serverless. It is an infinitely scalable so it can be scaled up to the global level. It's demo time. Today we'll do two demos for you.
01:04:26.742 - 01:05:00.530, Speaker A: The first demo we'll do an actual transaction on mainnet. Sorry, we couldn't do many transaction on mainnet because the gas prices are really high nowadays. In the second demo we'll demonstrate what all are the possible things with what all things that you can do with the mobile app. So let's go with the first one. We will open the mobile app and you can see all the assets which are supported by Aave. We can see all the analytics of each asset. What is the available liquidity, what is the total borrowed amount, what is the deposit rate, variable rate, stable rate and everything is fed directly from the Ave smart contract through our APIs.
01:05:00.530 - 01:05:26.748, Speaker A: Now let's try to deposit one ETH. Every on chain transaction is a two step process the first is reviewed, the second is confirmed. We can see there we are depositing one ETH. The user confirms it and the transaction will be broadcasted immediately on Minute. Here you can see the transition broadcasted. Let's go and check on Etherscan and you can see it's still pending and it will be okay. Success.
01:05:26.748 - 01:05:50.148, Speaker A: Let's go to the second demo and we'll show what all are the possibilities with the mobile app. You can see the asset has one deposit of KNC and he has two lows. One of ETH one is WBTC. He has a health factor of 2.2. We have already seen the deposit. Let's go to withdraw. Since he has already KNC, he can only withdraw KNC and we only let him to withdraw certain KNC so that his health factor is above 1.6.
01:05:50.148 - 01:06:06.372, Speaker A: Again, it's a two step process. Review and confirm. Let's go to borrowed. He can borrow all the assets which are possible on Ave. Again, maximum amount he can borrow is whatever can take his health factor to 1.62. Step process. Let's go to repaid.
01:06:06.372 - 01:06:25.452, Speaker A: He has only ETH in his wallet, so he can only pay ETH. He doesn't have WBTC to repay his WBDC loan. Again, it's a two step process. Moving to the next one. Switching of interest right from stable to variable, variable to stable. Both are supported and the last one which is the collateral setting. So you can also change your trust.
01:06:25.452 - 01:07:00.490, Speaker A: We are actually looking forward to work with Aave to improve the penetration of Aave protocol by releasing the official app on Play Store and App Store. Both iOS and Android app are production ready. We actually would be very happy if we can release the official Rest API for public and that would really help to grow the ava ecosystem by letting other developers to build on Rest APIs. And that's all from our side. Thank you very much. I kind of like it. How far are you from having this on the Play Store? One day.
01:07:00.490 - 01:07:33.552, Speaker A: Why is it on the Play Store then finish it yesterday. But we have tested all the transactions. We actually end up spending almost $700 to $800 to actually test all the transactions. Everything works on main. Net. We cannot release it on App Store for Apple because Apple requires any blockchain or any Ethereum based app to be released by a company, not by an individual developer. And that is why we need Aave helps.
01:07:33.552 - 01:07:54.430, Speaker A: And because this is an away app, it has to be released by the entity named Ave. I can't wait to use it. Yeah, you're in the right place to get in front of Stanny. I'm sure Stanny's going to see this and like it. So I think he's your next stop. Right? You guys need to just get this in front of Stanny, see what he thinks. I'm sure he'll cover your gas fees, but hopefully a lot more than that.
01:07:54.430 - 01:08:27.504, Speaker A: Yeah, we are actually looking forward to. Actually present it to our team. Any question that you have, feel free to answer it. Are you planning to create similar mobile UIs for other big projects? Yeah, so we have already created one for one inch and that app is already available on Play Store. Again, we couldn't do it on App Store, but it's available on Test flight. So if you want we can give you the link. And even for this one we have the APK.
01:08:27.504 - 01:09:17.424, Speaker A: If you have Android phone, you can flash it on your phone right now. But we were planning that once this hackathon is live, we would probably take the away code and make it a super app which has one inch away. And I think the next one we are trying is B protocol. And is this all open source? That's another thing. Are you providing these libraries back to other builders? Can people fork this thing and make something else? Yes, that's what we plan to do it, but probably after the hackathon because we just want to do some code cleaning process so that it is easily understood by others. But like if, for instance, someone wants to create an app that does ave credit delegation, you have the best starting point in the whole ecosystem at this point. So let's get that thing out there and let's get it open source.
01:09:17.424 - 01:10:12.916, Speaker A: We want to make our APIs public. Just want to check with Aave teamface if they are okay with that. Are there any usability issues or things that you think are much more difficult to handle on mobile that would be much more easy to show on a desktop? Just maybe because of constraints? Yes, if you already have a position with a way let's say you have ETH and you have some dye you have borrowed and you want to borrow more dai. So that calculation that goes in the back end, right, to make sure that your health vector doesn't go below one. So we are doing this calculation, but explaining this to the user on the phone is a little bit tricky. Yeah, I can imagine. I mean, that's really hard to show information in a very straightforward manner given the limited space on a mobile.
01:10:12.916 - 01:10:33.470, Speaker A: But I think you did a great job. Thank you. Amazing. And I'm assuming you guys will get to Stanny and there's no problem, but if the final boss provides any problems, you guys hit us up and we'll ping him too. August, thank you. Bye bye. Thank you.
01:10:33.470 - 01:11:06.836, Speaker A: It was really cool. Sweet. Moving along, we have not Arbitrum, but Arbitrarium, so yeah, feel free to take it away. Andre. Thanks. Let me share the video. It is only recently that cryptocurrency options have really kicked off.
01:11:06.836 - 01:11:51.610, Speaker A: In the last year or so, total bitcoin options open in interest has gone from about $200 million to over $5 billion. The primary venue for trading options is a centralized venue called Derabit. Derabit allows you to trade both Bitcoin and ethereum options across many different strikes and many different expiries. If we head over to the derebit UI we can see all the different strikes and all the different prices. And there are many of these. As we can see, there are hundreds and hundreds of combinations. However, recently there have also been some decentralized options protocols that have popped up which also offer the same service.
01:11:51.610 - 01:12:33.670, Speaker A: It's very hard to compare prices between each of these services because you have to use many different UIs. We wanted to create an options aggregator which consolidates different strikes across different expiries and different venues in a single UI. So we created an app called Arbitrarium. We only managed to finish the UI, we didn't manage to hook in prices. But you can see this is the concept. So at the top here you can pick the asset you're interested in. In this case we're looking at bitcoin USD options and on the right of here you have radio buttons which allow you to select the venues that you're interested in seeing prices for.
01:12:33.670 - 01:13:13.856, Speaker A: Beneath that you have an expiry selector. So by picking a date here, this would change the option down here that you see strikes for. On the left you can see the expiry price or the current price for each venue. The top price here is for derebit hedgek okx. And finally open. So there are different prices here because each venue has its own price tracker, so you can view those in a consolidated view as well. We created three themes for this.
01:13:13.856 - 01:13:54.770, Speaker A: We created a dark theme, which is this one also a gray theme and finally a light theme. The app is also compatible on mobile, so we can see here on mobile we have a little bit less information. We just show the calls in this instance. But you can toggle that by using the toggle here, which allows you to switch between calls and puts. And you can also toggle your exchanges that you're interested in and change your asset and also change the expiry. Soon we'll be hooking in prices. Unfortunately we didn't manage to finish it before the end of the hack, but you can expect that to be done soon.
01:13:54.770 - 01:14:51.514, Speaker A: Cheers. So yeah, that was our video. I think when a builder asks me what do you think I could build that the market wants on DeFi, I keep telling them build an options aggregator so you're on the right track. It needs to get much better for it to be useful. But you seem to understand what's needed because so far I don't know a single place where I can see the same financial product on a single view on real time. So I like it. I wish you keep building it.
01:14:51.514 - 01:15:53.440, Speaker A: If you find any hard, whether it's lack of funding or connections or mentoring, reach out to us because this is something ecosystem really wants our needs. Awesome, thanks. We'll keep building it and it looks so clear and straightforward and simple. That's the main achievement, I think. But it looks so simple, right? Yeah, that was one of our main goals, to make it easy for people who are not used to financial applications in general. And they just got into DeFi, for example, and we wanted to make it as simple as possible for these new users to get into DeFi and options specifically. I did a great job.
01:15:53.440 - 01:16:39.790, Speaker A: Thanks. Yeah, there's still some work to do, but yeah, we'll finish it and deliver, for sure. Patricio is counting on you. Yeah. And if you want ideas for something, be aware that there's like 15 decentralized financial derivative products out there, some of them extremely well funded. I mean, there are teams with tens of millions of dollars building products on the options field and they will need an interface for their users to find to get noticed. Make sure you are in contact with all those teams so they can be integrated out of the gate.
01:16:39.790 - 01:18:01.954, Speaker A: You think a part of the app could be for just a single product, like for example, just a page for Open and then another just for OKEx, because you've said some things don't have a UI still. Well, I guess, and this has been proven over the years on the theorem space sometimes, and it's more often than not, a highly polished graphic interface can trump the actual native interface of a protocol. Because all those protocols that I mentioned, those 15 that are out there, like potion, Pots, Open, et cetera, what they are focused on is the underlying tech, the smart contracts, the solidity code, and many times they don't have top talent front end stuff. Even if they want, they can really have their cake and eat them. Like if you are doing a highly complex financial protocol, you probably can't focus on the front end, so there's ample space for a front end that you can plug in because they are all open source. True. Find that similar UI.
01:18:01.954 - 01:18:26.706, Speaker A: I did the same thing where I was trying to build a wallet on multiple L two S. Right. You find the similar UI and you match one UI to everything and you kind of apply it to them. And like Patricia said, you can do it better than they can because they've got heady heady tech they've got to wrestle with. Yeah, they let them focus on the protocol itself and try to offer a great UI. Awesome. Keep building.
01:18:26.706 - 01:18:37.062, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks, guys. Thanks guys, for the great advice. We keep building, keep in touch. Feel free to reach. For sure. Thanks.
01:18:37.062 - 01:18:45.522, Speaker A: Yeah. Build in public. Keep building in public. That's the most important part. Thanks, guys. Bye. Bye.
01:18:45.522 - 01:19:18.994, Speaker A: All right, quick thing for the judges. If you guys did want to take a two minute break or anything, or if any one of you want to just mention now and we can do that break, I could go for a tinkle break. I'm not going to lie. Yeah. Okay, everyone, let's take a two minute break and thanks. Be back at 1115 or so. By the way, Patricia, your video and mic are still on.
01:19:18.994 - 01:22:19.772, Speaker A: Just FYI. Hey, Patricia, you have a fan. Someone's asking about your E badge. I have one also, but maybe you want to explain where you got it, actually. Is that a pope? It's a pope, isn't it? And it's medal. Who's asking? Stanamir Stoichev. Stoichev Stan.
01:22:19.772 - 01:22:54.620, Speaker A: Is he presenting now? No, he's in the chat. Can I guess? What? Well, it's a piece of pride. It's for everyone to know that I'm an Ethereum person. I have a I don't have a metal one, unfortunately, but I do have several of the patch ones from our different hackathons. Keep them close to your heart. I do. I actually have a shrine in my bedroom back home.
01:22:54.620 - 01:23:12.820, Speaker A: I'm not home right now. I literally have a shrine. Look at Austin's. Have you seen Austin's video? Oh, wow. Look at that. Yes. So I'm leasing a new place, so I don't have my own shrine.
01:23:12.820 - 01:23:58.640, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, everyone's back. So maybe we should keep the show. Oh, Stan says he thought that you own thousand ETH or something like buy after you have a certain number of ETH in your EOA, vitalik sends you, you go to Ethereum Foundation office in SUG and they check your wallet and you get one. I mean, we could do that because there can be more than 7000 people. Or is it 70,000? Actually, it would be too many tokens. Okay, we should keep things rolling.
01:23:58.640 - 01:24:17.076, Speaker A: I believe the next one up is Mohammed, who actually had been he put his hand up right at the start, so he's been here for a while. Thank you, Mohammed. Ave leverage from Right. Are you there, Mohammed? So, hi. Cool. Yeah, take it away. This is Avi.
01:24:17.076 - 01:24:32.924, Speaker A: Power up. Wait a second. Let me share your screen. So, yeah, can you see? Yeah. You changed your name for us. It's aven leverage. Yeah, I know.
01:24:32.924 - 01:25:06.626, Speaker A: I use the name Power Up in the presentation. That's fine. Power up is our DeFi project for market. Make calculation. By utilizing the Flash loan and one inch protocol, users will be able to leverage their loan or go long or short of an asset. And to avoid price and data manipulation, we use Channeling Oracle and the graph to fetch the data. Basic schematic is this platform works for both existing and new loans by utilizing the credit delegation.
01:25:06.626 - 01:26:25.824, Speaker A: For example, user can take a one Ethereum collateral and then take a Flash loan of two Ethereum and deposit three Ethereum. And then the contract would borrow the user loan using the credit delegation. And then using the one inch API, it swaps the token collateral to debt and then repel the Flash loan using that token validate plus the premium that takes from the user. Let's see it in action. We use the collateral token to die. And for the depth token we use USDC, we set the leverage to forex and slippage to 5% and the collateral amount would be 100. As you can see, the transactions are confirmed.
01:26:25.824 - 01:27:30.140, Speaker A: But since the contracts are not deployed on the main net, I can't demonstrate the deposits and depth. I use the graph API for that. And the graph only works for the main net, as you know. So that's it. Could you explain what happens under the hot place? Basically, once the user put the collateral as one ethereum, the flash loan used one ethereum as a collateral and then it deposits three ethereum to the heavy lending pool. And then using the lending pool it use the direct credit delegation to borrow from the user using the on behalf of and then it takes the borrow and swap it to the depth token. For example, depth token could be anything like USDC or anything.
01:27:30.140 - 01:28:36.864, Speaker A: And then it use that taken swap and the premium that took from the user to repay the flash loan. The premium will be paid before the contract call. What was the hardest part for you guys building this thing? What would you say you'd like to improve for the next guy who has to go through this same build? The hardest part was the lending pool interaction since it has some complex architecture and many things are not documented yet. So I have to dig in that code in the GitHub to find out. Many APIs. You also mentioned there is a debt token and a collateral token. So is this fully generalizable to any pair of two tokens? At least in theory and cool.
01:28:36.864 - 01:29:19.470, Speaker A: So then how does this affect the leverage ratio? Because some tokens are just much more volatile than others. I fetch the loan to value ratio from the graph and set the maximum amount using that. If you try to put some amount higher than LTV, it would ask you to lower it. But I didn't demonstrate that. I see. So that makes sense. And so what's the maximum leverage now in your example? It was forex.
01:29:19.470 - 01:29:59.260, Speaker A: Yeah, it was forex. I love the using the flash loan to unroll the position. It's such a clever, cool use of a flash loan. Nice. I don't know. Was that part of the documentation? Was that something you guys thought up? Like what spurred the idea of using the flash loan to repay or to get out of the position? Well, actually I took the idea from 1inchh as they told me this idea is pretty good to use and I chosen it. Awesome.
01:29:59.260 - 01:31:10.274, Speaker A: Are you planning to add more features to this in the future? Yes, of course. I got a lot of things in my mind and I listed them for the roadmap and I planned them in the future. But unfortunately for the time of the hackathon, I couldn't handle it. You can do it in the future, probably yes, exactly. Just to lean into that a little bit more, what do you think are the biggest concerns of yours in terms of adding onto this and building something and getting it into people's hands? What can we, as an ecosystem do better for you? For the deployment of the contracts, I didn't have any phone in my mind since I couldn't handle the gas fees. This date, we had to pay 300 gas for deployment, and for that reason, I didn't deploy it on main net. But after the sake, soon I will do it.
01:31:10.274 - 01:31:38.826, Speaker A: And for the help, I may need some team for that. And I am solo in this one. I couldn't find any team, so one thing right off the bat would be main net 40. It looks like time's up and we need to jump. Reach out to me. I'm at Austin Griffith on Twitter. We have a branch of Scaffold ETH that does main net forking and basically everything that's listed here in this thing, you can kind of fork that and build on top.
01:31:38.826 - 01:32:11.942, Speaker A: I use main net forking, but unfortunately the graph didn't work for that. Sure. OK, thanks. Good work, Mohammed. All right, next up, don't think they're in the chat just yet, but there's Twister and Jason. Is that you? Yep, yep. Cool.
01:32:11.942 - 01:32:54.530, Speaker A: Take it away, man. So this is Twister, a fork of tornado cash on the optimistic roll up. We didn't get to complete the whole project because of the technical complexity, but this is kind of just a scope of what we have so far. Wait, sorry, are you trying to share your screen right now? Oh, sorry, yeah, I have to forgot that part. Hello. This is Twister. This is a fork of tornado cash intended to run on optimism.
01:32:54.530 - 01:34:31.630, Speaker A: Here we have the core contracts of tornado cash as well as the open zeppelin contracts required to make tornado cache run. So this is using the ETH optimism plugin for hard hat to compile contracts. This doesn't work fully yet, as you can see below, when you run NPX hard hat compile, we get one error which kept us from finishing this, as you'll see in a second, which is the MIMC hash function. We have the bytecode outputted from building tornado cache itself, but we weren't sure how to link it with the compiler in hard hat, just to kind of show you guys what happened with the actual issue. So in Circumlib, which is a very popular library for ZK snark circuits, they have this MIMC gen contract. So MIMC is a hash function which is used in zkSNARKs, which is very friendly. It's like efficient since it has low multiplicative complexity.
01:34:31.630 - 01:35:47.900, Speaker A: And then the circuits themselves have some details with this because in a ZK snark you want to not multiply too many times. You have to do this thing where you basically store, you create like a storage slot for each time you have a value that's multiplied and so if you have a bunch of these right, you're going to just waste a bunch of memory and make your hash inefficient. MIMC is just basically a hash that's more efficient in terms of this sense. So the actual circumlud script that Tornado cache uses compiles the contract from scratch. So this is actually pretty hardcore, but it literally push on all the bytecodes individually and we just didn't have the time to reference the OVM spec and then basically translate each of these opcodes by hand to get this compiling on an optimistic rollout. So as you probably know yesterday, the original tornado has launched their token. So it's only reasonable to expect that they will capture value, whether it's in the form of fees or whatever.
01:35:47.900 - 01:36:33.820, Speaker A: So it makes sense that someone is already up to a speed on forking tornado, whether it's on a second layer or on main net. So a good thing you exist and hopefully when they search in phase, you can fork it and make it a real public good. Yeah, definitely. I think one of the really cool things about Tornado is that it's not just the contracts themselves, like the mining. They actually use a separate state route for mining verification because they basically check how long you've left your note in the deposit set. And so they're really good. And I don't know if you guys have checked out the governance forms, but the founders themselves are very technically they really know what they're doing.
01:36:33.820 - 01:37:21.922, Speaker A: It's very clever and I love them. But still, it makes sense that if someone doesn't care about the entropy or whatever and wants to have their own deployment but doesn't have the resources, I would totally support a fork like yours being productive. Yeah, I totally see where you're coming from. I think in this ethos of what we're building, it would make sense for us to actually be fully anonymous. Because if you expose the anonymity, instead you're just wasting you're making people waste a bunch of guys to print your governance. You know, it is what it so first thing this is dope. This is an awesome idea.
01:37:21.922 - 01:37:48.320, Speaker A: Tornado on OVM just gets me excited. That's all you have to say. I'm already in. Have you jumped into the OVM discord? I just talked to Ben Jones about this and kind of talking about some of the problems you guys are having and he said, get at us in the discord. So if you guys go in the OVM discord, if you haven't yet, especially this kind of stuff, this has Kelvin written all over it, this translation. Make sure you're connected with those guys. Oh, sorry.
01:37:48.320 - 01:38:46.402, Speaker A: Kelvin's been helping us a bunch, actually. So it's one of those things where it's like this is to the point where it's actually hard to write out this problem over text. We'd actually probably have to jump on some sort of a zoom call. And so I work on some other stuff full time as well as school. So it's really just like a time commitment issue for us, but totally can see this going further. Even the Tornado Cash team themselves, I'm sure they'd be interested in know at the end of like we respect what both optimism is building and also what the Tornado Cash team themselves are building. How much time do you think would it take for you to build this out fully, like to bring this to fruition? Well, this is the only contract that I know of that's generated like this because in Optimism they have a compiler that just compiles the solidity code into OVM and so this is the only contract that does not have a raw solidity code for it.
01:38:46.402 - 01:39:47.926, Speaker A: So once this translation is done, theoretically it should be able to run on optimism. Although actually getting it deployed is a different story because optimism doesn't have their testnet up yet. So it's only just a local testnet so far. So there's no COVID or whatever endpoint. So that would also probably take a while from just the deployment perspective. Anywhere from finishing this to there's always issues, but you should definitely keep up your work, I mean, now that you've come. So we're the team from UCLA doing this and originally I was interested in this idea because it's a good fit because the way optimism, the L2 roll works is that they do transactions off chain by merkel route updates, right.
01:39:47.926 - 01:40:46.266, Speaker A: And then they just push it to L One and then they have a fraud period of like a week I think. And then so if anyone has a dispute with the way the Merco Ruth has changed, they can basically dispute it. And so that's actually really nice because in Tornado Cash, what happens is that you put in your deposit and then your withdrawal is mixed with everyone else in the deposit or set. So the longer you leave it in there and the more people that deposit after you, the more plausible deniability you have in whose funds it actually is. So it's really good because both of them incentivize you to like I guess the trade off on the consensus part of optimism plays well into the incentive for added security in Tornado. Hey Jason, this is super cool, but unfortunately just with the timing we have to move forward. But yeah, I also personally am super interested in this.
01:40:46.266 - 01:41:00.160, Speaker A: I'd love to see optimism have Tornado Cash running on it. Basically. Yeah. Keep it up, keep building. Hit us up. If you hit a wall with those guys bug us, we'll bug them too. See you.
01:41:00.160 - 01:41:25.142, Speaker A: Sweet. The next one is Stan, the man who was talking about the pin earlier. So welcome Stan, to the show. And yeah, stage is yours. I think that you guys were going to play the video though because when I tried it on yeah, there's a few of these that I have the note for. I forgot which one? Sorry. Fantasy X.
01:41:25.142 - 01:42:14.402, Speaker A: Yes. Let me just quickly open it up just 1 second. Sorry. Share Screen Plc Team Fantasy X my name is Ali and together with my friend Stan, I would like to show you what we built for this hackathon. Now, our idea was to provide a platform which allows you to implement a blockchain version of your favorite fantasy sport. So it could be fantasy football, could be fantasy basketball, could be fantasy esport. That's actually what we focused on for this hackathon.
01:42:14.402 - 01:43:05.170, Speaker A: In particular, we use the popular multiplayer online battle arena game dota Two. So let me showcase the front end of our application that interacts with our smart contract. So as a participant, I will want to build my fantasy team of professional players represented by these cards, which in turn are represented by NFTs. Once I build my team, I will want them to compete against opposing teams. So notice how there are different properties associated to each professional player. Now these are properties like average number of kills, average number of assists, average number of debts. So there are proxies for their performance and these properties are dynamic.
01:43:05.170 - 01:43:51.590, Speaker A: And the monetary value associated to each player will fluctuate depending on their real world performance. Let me show you how I can buy one of these. So my MetaMask pops up and there you go. So the novel idea here is that we use an Oracle data feed to update the values of these properties in a transparent and proof way. And for this purpose, we built a custom chain link external adapter that connects to the Opendota API to get stats for each player that will be associated to their corresponding NFT. And that's it. Thanks for listening.
01:43:51.590 - 01:44:28.120, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry we couldn't show that much because we're both newbies, me and my friend. This is literally our first blockchain project. Believe it or not. Say that for being a newbie, it's not that bad. Tell us more about thank you. About the composition, I really loved it. I really like the fact that you guys organized so many things for us and that you're so helpful.
01:44:28.120 - 01:45:00.612, Speaker A: I tried to reach out for help, but I guess my issue was my own issue and I managed to fix it by myself. But at the end of the day, I'm really happy with the community. The only thing I'm not happy about, Austin, is not having the bow tie. Where's the bow tie? What is this exactly? It's a Tuesday. It's always so exciting to see new projects, like to see new people making new projects, to be hooking up MetaMask, to be hitting that button that first time. I love it. And I just want to see you continue to build in a space.
01:45:00.612 - 01:45:33.724, Speaker A: And if you have any roadblocks or you run into anything, reach out to me and let me help. We'll do, definitely. Thank you. But actually I meant by competition just to get back on that I meant like the competition between the players. But I'm glad to hear that you also like the competition itself. I love the projects. I really like ideas that are different than mine and everybody else's idea is different than everybody else's.
01:45:33.724 - 01:46:23.116, Speaker A: And I really love that somebody has an ATM idea. And I was shocked. My mind was so something really fun that is global does is that when the hackathon finishes, they put together all the submissions on a very digestible format. And if you enjoy this, I would totally encourage you to review those submissions of Hack money. Ethanline and Hackfs, they all have searchable functions. You can see who the founders are, GitHub profiles. I'm not an actual software developer and I still enjoy browsing over README files and reading their experience and the format.
01:46:23.116 - 01:47:18.450, Speaker A: There you have it on the chat, the different showcases particularly, I suggest you checking the one of the only one that's missing the hack money online because it's really a fun activity. It's something I say for my weekends when I want to do something fun for myself. And I'm sure you will love it. Thank you. Can you dig just for a second tell us a little bit more about that thing you had? It happens to me all the time where it's just like this freaking tool is not doing what I want it to. But really I didn't have the context of what it was supposed to be and I didn't understand what the difference was between a provider and a signer or something like that. Can you give us a little insight into kind of like what you banged your head up against? Sure.
01:47:18.450 - 01:48:04.610, Speaker A: What didn't we actually it's a team, first of all, we set up using Truffle and when we set up the contracts and we tried to pull from Open Zeppelin to extend to create the ERC 721, the compiler failed because I didn't know how to set it up accordingly. I banged my head against that for a really long time before I scrapped everything and did it again. And did it again. One of those things. Another thing that I really had hard time with is putting prices into MetaMask. I didn't know how to pass the extra parameter because I didn't find any documentation anywhere. I might suck at finding it, probably that's the case.
01:48:04.610 - 01:48:32.404, Speaker A: Have you seen that other toolkit called Hard hat? No, I only know MetaMask. I'm brand new. No, I mean regarding it's like a Truffle replacement. And it seems that developers getting their feet wet like it slightly more than Truffle. So maybe it makes sense for you to check it out. It's hardhat. Hardhat.org
01:48:32.404 - 01:48:56.896, Speaker A: I think hardhat.org you'll see some nice little characters and I'll even extend that shill to say check out Scaffold ETH. It's basically like a DAP in a repo that you can fork. And it includes ethers, it includes Hard hat. It has things like buttons that add those extra. Parameters that call things to MetaMask, just as an example. So it has a lot of copy paste examples for you, and a lot of stuff is standing up.
01:48:56.896 - 01:49:06.916, Speaker A: Yes. And recommend brownie as well. I think we would, but that's my friend. He does the python. I don't do python. So that's him. Yeah.
01:49:06.916 - 01:49:28.212, Speaker A: I think that's for python, folks. Yeah. Don't be afraid to reach out at Austin Griffith on Twitter. Hit me in the will do. Thank you. Okay, I guess we're done. I think we are, yeah.
01:49:28.212 - 01:50:09.340, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Hello. I represent the conscient team for the market make. Akaton. I'm Isodong Jafaro, founder and developer.
01:50:09.340 - 01:52:54.810, Speaker A: Due to a lack of transparency in property ownership, the growth of paper consumption a costly risk we have when we invest in a property and a profit taking time to come. We built a progressive web app where anyone can transparently purchase and trade affordable token of property and make some daily return and get under collateralized loan. How it works. So as an owner, I have to prove my ownership and have a digital proof of existence back. And as a customer, I can check the digital proof of existence of an asset and purchase that asset. As NFT, our future work will be to add more tokenized, valuable assets like uber taxi or debt, and also introduce a tokenization tool for business and later a governance protocol for our users and, of course, going mainnet. So let's see how it it okay.
01:52:54.810 - 01:53:23.550, Speaker A: That's all for the presentation. Thank you for some questions. Thanks a lot. So I'm curious to know if you have looked a bit into the legal recognition of the property that you're trying to tokenize. How does that work? Maybe in your jurisdiction, or is that something you are? Yeah. Yes. Currently, I've researched that here in France.
01:53:23.550 - 01:54:04.980, Speaker A: So currently I'm in France, but the company is in US. So currently in France, we have something we call that is a property that can be represented by a company. So currently, those tokens will be like a part of a company. I think legally, we have no problem with that. I see. So there is a company that owns the property, and you basically tokenize a share of that company. Exactly.
01:54:04.980 - 01:54:44.928, Speaker A: In the future, we won't need to own the property, but any real estate agent can tokenize their own property, and our user will just come and purchase those tokens. Great. Thanks a lot. That makes sense. And I hope that the jurisdictions will follow other countries, because this is really the interesting part, where revert assets become usable. Yes. Where was that deployed? I saw the site, and then I saw a little ether scan.
01:54:44.928 - 01:56:05.060, Speaker A: Is that testnet? Is it live? That something we can play with. What's out there? Yes, it's on Testnet, it's on Coven, but we try to put it with Matic. We try to do it with Matic, but we have some issues so we decided to continue with Coven. So also, if you are owner of a property NFT, you can use the delegate collateral to apply for a loan on AV platform. It makes sense to investigate the Matic deployment because with the current gas prices, everything Mainet is so expensive and Matic is so much yes, yes, I understand it because I tried to put some liquidity last time, and I pay a lot of fees on the gas. So, yeah, definitely I will put Matic on the platform. How are the property prices determined? Are they pulled in using some oracle? No, they are not determined.
01:56:05.060 - 01:56:37.070, Speaker A: We know the price of the property currently. We know the price of the property, and you just go and grab how much you want of the property so it's not fixed. Like, you can pay $25. You will pay as much as you have in your bag. But there is, like, initial price of the property that yes, $25 is the initial price. I see. That should be cheap enough for most.
01:56:37.070 - 01:57:40.300, Speaker A: Any other questions? Anything you got hung up with on Tooling? Like, anything other than Matic stuff, we've kind of dug in, but anything else that if you could smooth this process out for the next guy? Anything in particular that you got hung up on that you would like to see improved within the ecosystem currently? I don't know. We are looking for an acceleration program maybe that can help us really accelerate the project. So I think the only thing I'm currently looking for from the commute you might be interested in looking at in Paris, they have, like, a program around, some blockchain stuff, and we did a hackathon there two years ago. Okay. So there's some funding programs there. There's some good developers there. It might be just an interesting ecosystem to tap into in France.
01:57:40.300 - 01:57:59.510, Speaker A: Yes, I know. Eco Carande. I used to work with some developer. I think we're out of time, but I think that you're in the right place. Also, like, ethereum hackathons are a great place to accelerate your ethereum hack idea. Keep building. Keep showing up for these.
01:57:59.510 - 01:58:25.084, Speaker A: Keep the momentum going. Good job. Thank you. Thanks, man. Okay, next up is liquid DeFi Z Morris. And I am once again going to procure the video. So let me pull that up and just to confirm you're there.
01:58:25.084 - 01:59:22.890, Speaker A: Right, Z? Yes. Cool. Okay, the video is coming up presenting liquidify, implementing decentralized finance through protocols such as Aave and Uniswap. This is a work in progress. Let me demonstrate a portion. I'm going to start from scratch. So basically, this is an Escrow where you have an arbiter and a beneficiary.
01:59:22.890 - 02:00:29.730, Speaker A: Typical contract. Typical contract between the two parties where the beneficiary will receive the funds after perhaps whatever they agree to in the contract. In this case, I call the Arbiter, the Escrow manager, and the Escrow receiver is the beneficiary. In this case, I'm going to act as both and use my account. So what you do in this case is you enter those parties. I'll use my address for both. Now, we can choose an amount that might be a little bit too high because of the fees, but you can choose any amount at this point.
02:00:29.730 - 02:01:37.938, Speaker A: I will then choose approve and deploy and I'll have to submit my transaction fee and to approve the die two in the morning. I heard you say now, wow, it's still quite high. So I do not have enough ether for this transaction. I believe that is why it won't let me continue. Let me double check. But basically this is the premise and wow, it's very high. It's correct there, yes.
02:01:37.938 - 02:02:16.330, Speaker A: So I have to reject this, unfortunately. And I really wanted to show you because once you do approve it, your contracts will be listed here where it says existing contracts. So I will continue to build upon this and I hope you have a little bit of an understanding and we'll be able to implement this a lot further in the future. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I think an escrow contract, it's a very basic primitive that we still haven't solved. So it makes sense to build this thing.
02:02:16.330 - 02:02:59.000, Speaker A: My advice would be to plan on deploying it on Matic just because it's much easier for experiments and then improve the usability, like adding ENS support. Are you familiar with ENS? Yes. So ENS is quite fundamental for these things. And then it needs to have the ability to escrow other things than die, like at least ether or USDC, which is what usually people want to escrow. Right. I was using the Covon testnet so that's where I could get the die. Unfortunately, not enough ether.
02:02:59.000 - 02:03:49.992, Speaker A: Really? Basically, this was a scrap up from my original project, which is I wanted to follow the documentation for Ave and do a loan. And after you do the loan, what can you do with it before it's paid? So I wanted to do some swaps, do some arbitrage. So originally I built that loan and that worked. But then when I started to do the front end, I had some problems. And basically I'm really noticing that one. When you go into the front end, you want to bring your projects to the front end, your contracts, if you have more than one. What if you want to bring in all the providers and then the tokens? So I crashed on that a few times.
02:03:49.992 - 02:04:09.184, Speaker A: So I deleted my GitHub repositories a few times, started over. Nobody becomes proficient in ethereum development overnight. This is really hard stuff. Yeah. Just seeing you hit a button and it triggers a MetaMask. I said this earlier. That is the first step.
02:04:09.184 - 02:04:26.070, Speaker A: That is the key visceral experience. And that's the thing. You're coding up. Check out the tooling, keep working. My advice, I mean, hit me up if you need some covan. I am a covan whale and I can set you up. But yeah, just keep building.
02:04:26.070 - 02:04:52.540, Speaker A: Exactly. That's what I'm going to do. Yeah. Because I was really excited when I first started this project. I was going smoothly, but then when I jumped to the front end, I had some problems there. And that's another thing I really should have stick with one thing and stay on that. Then when I started building this escrow, I was saying I saw some other documentation where you could have multiple people.
02:04:52.540 - 02:05:28.888, Speaker A: So it's not just one person joining in. So you can have a bunch of people sign in on this contract and then during that, maybe one of them could take a loan out and then as long as they pay it back or actually they will be withdrawn from the contract and then when it's paid back, everybody gets their money back. And then if there's interest, then you could decide what to do with that as well. So, yeah, it's really exciting. There's a lot you can do. Got to keep on working, keep building. Yeah.
02:05:28.888 - 02:06:12.724, Speaker A: What's the next step you want to implement to realize what was that, what's the next step or the missing piece that you would like to see or that you would like to add next? Well, I'm really interested in upgradable contracts. Yeah. So what happens when you make some changes? But really, I really have to finish and get the basics down. So I'm working on it. Sure. But I'm sure you will get the basics done soon so that you can move over to those more exciting stuff like the upgradability pattern. Yes.
02:06:12.724 - 02:06:44.130, Speaker A: And also the graph and just seeing what's going on. I'm interested in tooling too. So you just see what's going on. Comparison. Hey, before I make the swap, what is it on Uniswap? What is it on these other protocols? Or split amongst all of them, see who's fastest, who gives the best rate. Looking forward to see you on a future east global hackathon. Yes, I'm going to be having a better project soon.
02:06:44.130 - 02:07:02.500, Speaker A: Thanks so much, man. Thank you for presenting. Thank you. Thank you guys. Awesome. Two more projects. And the next up is Rahul, whose project name is Rahul.
02:07:02.500 - 02:07:30.220, Speaker A: I like, yeah, the floor is yours, Rahul. Hi everyone. So I will be talking about Sci Finance. I have been working on this project for quite a while now. And this is the same submission which I made to its online global hackathon. So the page that you are looking at is for the NFT booster sale. So these NFTs, these act as discount coupons for siphon ends.
02:07:30.220 - 02:08:18.172, Speaker A: So you can basically select this is a related artwork to the currently selected booster. And this is host on filecoin where the CID for the artwork is encoded within the smart contract. So you can simply just buy it here. So these NFTs, they also act as discount coupons for siphons. So with siphon ends, these use ARBs veto contracts and I have made certain modifications to it to get the desired behavior. So the website is currently live here. So here you can basically it works on Coven.
02:08:18.172 - 02:08:55.560, Speaker A: So you can just select the instrument that you want and enter the amount. You can either mint, approve, deposit, redeem, borrow, repay. Here you'll get your current portfolio, the numbers, and this is like PSI farming. So here you can see the volatility. So for example, Bitcoin, the previous price was 38.8 and let's say the current price is 33.33,000. So this is the volatility for the total deposited liquidity and this is the maximum harvest that the users can get.
02:08:55.560 - 02:09:24.228, Speaker A: And this is the amount that is actually harvested. And this is the APY. So these are currently simulated numbers. The documentation is currently live. So you can just read and go through what I have been working upon. So, the long term, my thinking is that we are currently in the second stage of asset tokenization and I believe we will see upcoming digital curation markets. So this is what I am trying to research into.
02:09:24.228 - 02:10:06.956, Speaker A: And if you look at the NFT here, this basically talks about the infrastructure which I want to basically develop under Sci-fi. So under network intelligence, it's bonding curves, econometric design, state channels for the on chain infrastructure. These are the NFTs which will be going live pretty soon. Then there's a lending protocol, then the PSI harvest and then the digital creation market which I intend to develop. And it will be supported by the off chain infrastructure. Yeah. And the long term thing is that I want to research into econometrics and financial designs which can basically finance space innovation.
02:10:06.956 - 02:10:45.340, Speaker A: So let's say I want to do some experiment in space. Then I am basically looking into econometric models. So through an tokenized model I should be able to fund that like space initiative. So that's the overall idea and open to questions. Thank you. Have you built everything yourself? Yes, it's like a lot of work, even just the UI. You spent a lot of time crafting the experience and it feels like GeoCity meets DeFi.
02:10:45.340 - 02:11:38.752, Speaker A: I love just the vibe of this thing is really cool. Yeah, I have been working on this for like past five, six months now. And I started off basically kind of researching into what's happening here because initially I was working as a foreign investment bank and there I was looking into security tokens market, but that's not innovative, that's just like too much regulated and you can't do anything. So I got into this ethereum development space and since that I have been developing this and just trying to create something new, something innovative. But I think now it's almost there. So we'll be fun to see how it basically shapes from here. It seems that you've also built like a complete exhaustic documentation of all that just like undocumented and you just have to find out how they work.
02:11:38.752 - 02:12:36.256, Speaker A: Now, you've done all that, right? The thing is, when I was building and when I shared it, for example, in the video itself, I haven't really described how the volatility works because the harvesting works. Because the thing is, what I'm trying to do is I have parameterized yield farming. So inherently I'm capturing the market sentiment during yield farming. With that, I'm trying to minimize a loss potential. So, for example, if you're depositing your capital into AR and you are earning interest, but still you will face losses because if the price itself goes down, which doesn't seem like it's happening, but that is a certain case. So in those situations, you will get our instrument and using off chain AI models and modeling techniques, simulation techniques, we can simulate it in a way to minimize your actual loss potential. So if you are actually taking loan, then you will get this instrument when the price goes up.
02:12:36.256 - 02:13:05.228, Speaker A: So whenever you're in a loss position, we are trying to compensate for that. Wow. So when AI meets Blockchain, meets GeoCities. The thing is, within institutional finance, AI is a big thing right now, not blockchain, but Blockchain is a new finance. And I think they will eventually emerge. But it will be quite different because within institutional finance, it's mainly for trading. Right.
02:13:05.228 - 02:13:47.048, Speaker A: But I think with DeFi, it will be more about creating econometric models. So that is what I've been looking into. Yeah, I usually give this advice that when you take on this giant project, there are these holes and there's these weird things that you find that like, oh, this little piece right here is totally missing in the space. I can get product market fit by solving that thing. Instead of you've definitely been in this expand mode. It might be good to go into a reduced mode and pick up. But my caveat there is maybe this overwhelming crazy UX is exactly the kind of thing that will capture your own community.
02:13:47.048 - 02:14:31.876, Speaker A: And this is the thing that I could see a wave of people diving in and just playing around with this and getting into this UX. But I also would say kind of just like expand a lot, reduce down to something, and maybe even take this thing and leave it standing where it is, reduce down to something small and rebuild some small piece and try to launch that and see what kind of product market fit you get there. Also I agree with that. And that is why I added NFTs. So these NFTs, the contracts have been audited. I'm just making the final check. So initially I'll do the NFT launch on Mainet, and after getting some basic funds for auditing the other contracts, then I'll do other launch.
02:14:31.876 - 02:15:15.344, Speaker A: And I agree with your suggestion. But the thing is, I essentially want to converge it with Space Tech. And I have been having this thing for past five months. Elon Musk. Purchased bitcoin yesterday. But I knew this thing was coming for past year. Because the thing is, we meme about mining bitcoin on moon, like taking bitcoin on moon, but actually, econometrically speaking, if we actually mine bitcoin on moon, that is a feasible solution to actually establish research labs on Moon, because solar electricity, that will be more effective on moon because it doesn't have any atmosphere.
02:15:15.344 - 02:16:09.372, Speaker A: And if you are a private entity and you are doing a space exploration feature then you can't get money from these ventures. But if you actually mine bitcoin on Moon which is a meme right, but it will actually have an impact on price and it will actually help establish research labs on Moon. So I think that is something that is doable in the coming decade and I just want to get involved and maybe that's why it's just kind of like bizarre project that I've been building too many different blocks together. I love it. You need to have crazy ambitious goals and this is definitely ambitious. I love it. Any questions? Any physicians? What was hard for you? Give us something.
02:16:09.372 - 02:16:19.876, Speaker A: It looks like we may be out of time. Okay. Maybe we should go DM sometime or something like that. Feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear about your journey. Sure. Thanks so much Rabul.
02:16:19.876 - 02:16:36.624, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. Cool. Thanks everyone. We've got one project remaining, zeus. Looks like it's a mobile app. I have the video zike, that's you, right? Yep. Cool.
02:16:36.624 - 02:17:09.930, Speaker A: I have your video. I'm going to play it in just 1 second it and I'll talk over it. So don't be worried if you can hear. Right? Okay. Yeah. So this is sports prediction market. So really wanted to capitalize on a lot of hype not just around the Super Bowl but around all sports being back.
02:17:09.930 - 02:18:24.960, Speaker A: So big focus on the NBA, March Madness and American sports initially. So each one of these would be a league which would then have the bets or the matches, teams and games under it. Fell, NHL, FIFA, MLB and March Madness. And then I pull the results and matches for these games from the chain link API, Oracle network. First tab is the league, the second tab is a game as well as some of the players. So in the APIs they do have a variety of things that you could make a prediction on including like how many points over under a player or score and then also their stats going forward. And then this would be linked to the Ave wallet where you would actually be able to add leverage to your bids and then this would show your winnings.
02:18:24.960 - 02:19:30.230, Speaker A: And then one thing that I was exploring with, so we'll have a native like Zeus Token and then your winnings would be able to be either transferred or used for purchases for sports memorabilia or tickets or other prizes or tokens. So that was the mobile side. And then this is the web DAP. And so you just have your match results and then you can pick which side. So this is just on Covon. But I did it for Golden State but then for the example, also did it for the spurs on the other side and then after this you would actually be able to leverage. And one thing about sports betting, they have money lines so it's not always even and there will be a spread sometimes that they need to cover.
02:19:30.230 - 02:20:41.420, Speaker A: But then with Ave, a big thing was looking for arbitrage opportunities. So this was one where a lot of times different sports books will actually have different lines on the game slightly. So using a flash loan you could actually take advantage and be able to place those bets and capture a small thin spread that you couldn't really lose on the demo. And yeah, we'd love to hear you like that's an awesome UI for the mobile. I mean, I really loved the clean and nice way, how you presented it. The desktop application looks a bit different. Was that done by the or like a different person just out of curiosity? No, I did it also but I just didn't style it as hard because the mobile really was like the core focus and then that was more just to make sure that I could make a bet and had all the info and could make the calls and things like that.
02:20:41.420 - 02:22:19.544, Speaker A: So the mobile is the main part of it. What's the current status of the code base? What do you mean? How far are you on coding? The code base is pretty far like the app you show in the demo that could be released fairly within the next week or two. So that part's pretty far along and then that's why I did some of the just like the smart contract calls and stuff but a lot of that's all ready to go. One question I had, maybe I totally missed this, but I see Aave and I'm assuming there's some sort of staking and maybe like yield redirection here, but how does the betting work? Are you betting with your yield? Are you betting with ETH? Are you betting with credit? How does Ave connect to sports betting in this? Yeah, yeah. So we actually created the lending pool so that people could deposit their tokens into that and then also earn the interest on that while they're in the pool and then they'd be able to get that interest either way, even if they lost a bet. So really like no hard lockup of you stake toward Golden State and if they win, you win your yield back, but if they lose, you lose your yield or something like that. That's a perfect thing for using something like ethereum, but it's more like you took Aave, you stake some stuff, you earn some yield.
02:22:19.544 - 02:22:50.340, Speaker A: But also we're going to do some sports betting over on this side and kind of connect those two. Yeah, exactly. And then that allows you to claim those rewards. Right. So you still had to make that the prediction beforehand and then that would earn you a certain amount of potential if they did win. And probably just a total tangent to go on here. Let it be a lesson to all of us that mobile apps, or DApps, are going to have to look like that before they get mass adoption.
02:22:50.340 - 02:23:58.510, Speaker A: The current DApps that we have aren't usually mobile as mobile, and it's getting way better in the space. But for the mainstream audience, that mobile app that you showed, that's what it's going to have to look like for us to be able to capture an audience. Thank you. Any last questions? I mean, what about legality? Have we talked about is this legal? I think prediction markets are legal, right? You should DM Joey Krug from Auger, who has spent a lot of time thinking about building prediction markets and betting markets and the legality around it and companies founded around that topic. He works at Pantera Capital, but he's also the founder of Auger, and if you DM'd him or message him on Twitter or something, I'm sure he'd be very interested. Awesome, dude. I could also make an intro just in a conversation with him, so if you're interested yeah, no, I definitely am interested.
02:23:58.510 - 02:24:21.184, Speaker A: And future hackathons, I want to see the functionality of the site wired into the mobile app and I want to see all this working in a year. Hopefully I'll give it to you in a month. All right, sounds great. Thank you, ZK. You guys are awesome. Good work, man. Good design.
02:24:21.184 - 02:24:36.968, Speaker A: Cool. All right, I think that's it. That's a wrap. Wow. Thanks so much to everyone. I don't know who's still in the room. That was thanks.
02:24:36.968 - 02:25:02.720, Speaker A: You know, Austin, Robert, Patricio and Rochelle. Rochelle has been super silent, but she's been doing all the stuff behind the scenes, so thank you. Yeah, awesome. It's been super fun. Yeah. Any last thoughts from you guys? Well, I like the Pokemon one asienda it is the only one I clicked. Highlight.
02:25:02.720 - 02:25:43.950, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm excited to share some of these things on Twitter. I also really like it's interesting always to see the perspective, the different vantage points that everyone's kind of coming at this industry from and this technology from. It really is like it could be something as extremely complicated as putting our cash on optimism, which is like, you're getting involved with low level cryptography, or it could be trying to create sports betting markets, or it could be go to the moon and do bitcoin mining. There's so many different ways you can get into this. Always. It's always interesting to see that.
02:25:43.950 - 02:26:08.356, Speaker A: Thank you, Leon. But the nice UIs we have seen, I mean, quite a few of them, really nice. Thanks a lot. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. I wish I could get everybody together. That is about to build their own UI and show them Scaffold ETH and be like, look, it's all wired up for you already.
02:26:08.356 - 02:26:37.132, Speaker A: You just drop in your contract and you're going to have the UI. We get them over the first couple of weeks, I feel like. And then there's a totally different learning period of just getting context for the space, right. Kind of going on a tour of duty and learning what tools are out there and kind of like what people have already built. There's just a lot of context to gather before you can really hit a home run, and sometimes you can get lucky and just hit a home run. But a lot of cool projects. I love seeing these.
02:26:37.132 - 02:26:56.704, Speaker A: This is always exciting for me. Well, it's been a pleasure to share this panel with you. And until the next event, likewise. Yeah. I love hanging out with you guys. I can't wait to be together in person again, but this is still great. Have a good day, everyone.
02:26:56.704 - 02:26:59.916, Speaker A: Happy Tuesday. Hearts. Hearts. Hearts. Thanks, everyone. Bye.
