00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.146, Speaker A: Welcome everybody. My name is Kartik.
00:00:03.338 - 00:00:10.800, Speaker B: And I'm Luke, and we're going to be your MCs today for the storage provider summit. We couldn't be happier to have all you with us in attendance today.
00:00:11.490 - 00:01:12.302, Speaker A: So we're watching all of this on Eepglobal TV. And for those of you who are joining us for the first time, this is what we're going to be using for all of today's talks and we encourage all of you to log in and engage with all of speakers. You'll be able to ask any questions here and we'll be able to relate those questions directly to all of our talks. For everybody who also logs in and engages, we're also giving out a poop NFT Token, so be sure to say hi to us, the speakers and the global team. So this summit is part of Hackfs and Hack FS is a month long event which is a hackathon and a few summits. For the hackathon, we have over 650 developers from 61 different countries spending 18 different time zones building the latest and the greatest on IPFS and Filecoin and just whatever creative things that are possible now with Web Three. And also part of this hackathon, we're doing two summits highlighting the incredible things happening in the Protocol Labs ecosystem.
00:01:12.302 - 00:02:07.880, Speaker A: Last Friday the 6th, we did our Builders Day Summit, and today we're going to be focusing on storage providers and talking about that side of the ecosystem. So let's get into what today is all about. We have some amazing talks for the next few hours and we're super excited to share what we're going to cover. We're going to kick the day off by talking about what the business opportunities are on the storage side and we're going to do a panel covering different aspects of being a storage provider. Then we're going to have another panel about what does it mean to invest into Web Three startups and what do investors think about when they are looking to build and fund companies. Then we'll have ZX talk about what does it mean to bridge with FalcoIn and all the new things that are possible with Web Three. Then we'll have Michelle cover how you can actually take advantage of the grants opportunities in the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystem and further along your projects in a nondilutive way.
00:02:07.880 - 00:02:42.890, Speaker A: And lastly, we'll have Deep and Gail and talk about Filecoin. Plus they have some amazing announcements planned for you today and I can't wait for everybody to share the amazing things that they want. So with that, let's jump right into our very first talk. This panel is designed to or just is titled Business Opportunities and Storage Site, and we have Charles, Stewart, Kevin and Neo as our panelists. And moderating this chat will be Stefan and I'll. Let Stefan and all of our panelists introduce themselves now. So without further ado, please welcome all of our panelists.
00:02:42.890 - 00:02:48.820, Speaker A: I'll ask all of you to turn your videos on and we'll go right into our talk.
00:02:50.230 - 00:03:19.206, Speaker C: Perfect. Thank you so much, Kardik. Before we start today, first of all, welcome. Very excited to discuss a little bit more in detail the business opportunities on the storage provider. I want to talk about how I look at the Falcon ecosystem. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to look at the sky with one of my friends who's an. You know, when you live in a city like myself here in San Francisco, it can be foggy, can be really hard because of light pollution to actually see the stars in the sky.
00:03:19.206 - 00:04:08.934, Speaker C: We were kind of wandering through the sky with this new telescope, and we kind of landed on this really cool region called Omega Nebula. And as I'm trying to explain to him what Falcone is and what we do here every day, day in, day out. And he's trying to explain to me all the different galaxies and the cool stuff that he's working on as an astronomer. We kind of landed on Omega Nebula as being like, that place where we connected, because if you look at this region, it's one of the most brightest and massive star forming regions closest to our galaxy that we know of today. And it creates all these new stars. And so when I was looking at it and I was like, hey, what is this called? He's like, well, it's Omega Nebula. It's a nursery of stars.
00:04:08.934 - 00:04:51.462, Speaker C: And I'm like, wow, that's exactly how I look at filecoin, right? What we're doing here at Hackfast, what we're doing with the whole ecosystem is exactly this. We're building new companies, we're building new stars. And I thought it was really cool. And also we had a long conversation on how he should be storing all these images, because actually, this is a real image from that telescope here in my backyard two weeks ago, how he should be storing it on filecoin, of course. So that's the next conversation we'll have with his engineers. So today, what do we want to focus on as innovation happens across the universe within filecoin, not just on the front side. By creating new applications, we also look at the storage provider side.
00:04:51.462 - 00:05:40.520, Speaker C: There's a lot of opportunity there. The storage provider, we have now more than 2700 storage providers and growing every single day. They thought it would be interesting to bring a couple of providers to the table and have a conversation around where innovation can happen there as well. And so as you can look at this universe, we'll talk a little bit more about infrastructure as a service onboarding of data, data protection, et cetera, as we onboard more customers through our platform. So let me welcome Neo, Charles, Kevin, and Stuart to our panel session today and very happy to have you here. So let's kick it off with a first question for Neo. Neo, you're part of IPFS main.
00:05:40.520 - 00:05:59.310, Speaker C: You have a ton of filecoin powered. You've been adding a lot of filecoin power to the network. What's interesting to me is you've kind of started in China, but can you tell us a little bit more about IPFS? Maine has reinvented itself since the start of Mainnet and where you see opportunities for some of these newer startups.
00:05:59.730 - 00:06:13.522, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much Stephan, for the great introduction. Actually, fun fact about myself when I was a little kid, my dream job is to be an astronaut flying spaceship among the stars and that's really beautiful galaxies you're sharing there.
00:06:13.576 - 00:06:14.180, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:14.630 - 00:07:00.530, Speaker D: So just about myself, just a brief intro. I'm Neog from IPFS Main. We are one of the sponsors of Hack FS 2021 and we sponsored this same hackathon last year as well. The reason we like so much about Hack FS is that we find it's a really great place to find new business opportunities of cyberspace. Both IPFS Main and myself invested projects from the hackfs last year and we're planning to do the same thing this year as well. Well as a storage provider, we used to call it a minor. We started all the way from the beginning of FICO Network and currently we are bearing over 300 petabyte capacity and looking to expand globally.
00:07:00.530 - 00:08:12.860, Speaker D: Now we have over 90% of the capacity located in China. And if you stand from the client's point of view, it's not very good practice to have such centralized storage even though they are distributed between different data centers, but it's still within one continent. Well, most storage clients focus on availability and durability. So we built a full set of customized Lotus seedling algorithm optimization and storage solution to ensure that clients data is available when needed and protected against failures and errors. But more importantly is that we start to shift our focus to support other regions like North America and Europe. And in spite of different crypto friendly or UN friendly policies, I believe global expansion of ficoin storage, providing service is inevitable in long term. So we are happy and looking forward to working with local ficoin storage provider groups in different continents with our expertise of ficoin storage providing services.
00:08:14.270 - 00:09:10.458, Speaker C: Great, thanks. So that's fantastic to hear and I think you brought up a really good point is that it's a very strong community, right? So multiple storage providers work together across multiple regions. So when you design products or when you design solutions, you have to keep that in mind because as you mentioned, clients are looking at protecting their data across multiple regions, multiple countries, et cetera. The other thing you mentioned, which I want to comment to, is that we call this the storage provider panel session because as you mentioned, we put a proposal, or the community put a proposal together to rebrand the miner terminology to storage provider. Again, to be closer to the end customer because that's really what all of you are doing, which is providing a storage service and then some cool next to the next I want to bring Charles. Thank you so much NIA. Charles, the next question is for you.
00:09:10.458 - 00:09:41.240, Speaker C: Your company has know sort of evolved, right from being a storage provider also to a solutions provider. When you're working with enterprise companies, you kind of figured out that onboarding data is not always that easy. So you've found ways to innovate and help your customers to bring data on board faster. Can you give us an example of what challenges you have seen to deliver a good storage service and what applications have you built? Please educate us because you have some great stuff there.
00:09:41.690 - 00:10:21.682, Speaker E: Yeah, first one is based in Montreal, Canada. We were a storage provider before. We provide about ten nodes in North America for different data for our clients. So early this year we found that there are so many clients have big interest in Frycom storage science. With verified data, Frycoin can provide almost free for all the clients. They know this news and they feel excited about it. However, there was barrier for them because those industrial customers usually come for example the big data processing or machine learning.
00:10:21.682 - 00:10:57.946, Speaker E: They have a large demand of data. But however their existing structure was building on the centralized cloud platform like Amazon, Google Cloud. What do they want is that their engineers wanted to migrate to Brighton. Which means that they need some framework, tools or platform to help do the migration. Give an example of a local AI company called AI. They're doing algorithms. They have a huge amount of data labeling on their network.
00:10:57.946 - 00:11:51.342, Speaker E: Currently, storage on the AWS spends about thousands of dollars per month just for script. But when they migrate to Friday, the first question is that their data scientists have been getting used to using S Three as the framework. So they upload download and there are lots of development based on S Three. Now, the question come to us that if they cannot doing this migration easily based turnkey solutions for example Monday they are being so afraid of doing that. So, what do we do is that we're building the entire solution for them. We're building the cache layer for them to upload to accelerate the data access from the storage to computing. We're building the S three compatible interface to us called FS Three.
00:11:51.342 - 00:12:43.270, Speaker E: It is gateway to migrate your existing data from AWS to APS, then through the backup to fracture network without much human interaction. We're also building the aging environment for them to secure data in a catch environment, doing encryption before they upload to fragrance network. With those we also provide them the API access. Because developers getting used to API access is not like the normal end customers. Like they were using web interface. So they wanted to have those kind of and also some permission based access for some specific data. So with all those help, they'll be able to start migrating.
00:12:43.270 - 00:13:54.150, Speaker E: Then we also help them to apply for some devgrounds while they are building the tool so they get support from the Frico Foundation. Another interesting thing is that they have company currently located in China, which is using AliCloud as a bridge to send the data from China to Canada, which is lots of cost when they're using that protocol for transfer because adi cloud charge a large amount of money when you're doing the transportation cross candidates with the FireCon. We have so many nodes, over 3000 storage providers across the world and we have so much power in China, so most of them willing to provide those service for free. So with this advantage they are be able to downgrade their cost by 70% without impact over their business. So that's why we see that it's freak one and FFS that greater tools, but we really need us as solution provider to give them greater tools to accelerate their development.
00:13:55.450 - 00:14:43.410, Speaker C: Excellent. I like you brought up a ton of good points here. One is that what I'm hearing is that storage providers like yourself are also innovating by bringing more interfaces and make it easier for customers to onboard. So also secondly is that the ingest of sorry, the egress from existing cloud providers is expensive and anything that we can help with that making that easier so that more data can be ingested in even different formats. Because one of the unique items of Falcon here is that you have that unique ID and it doesn't really matter if it came in through an S Three interface or a virtual file system or a custom SDK. Cool. Thank you for that, Charles.
00:14:43.410 - 00:15:14.610, Speaker C: So, Kevin kevin. You're at picnic. One of the things that we kind of mentioned already is the provider community is very strong, right, very interconnected. One thing that keeps me impressing is how collaborative everyone is. Also for this panel session was so easy to have the support from everyone to communicate and sit on this panel. You for sure have been engaged with onboarding and data movement of some large customer data sets in petabyte scale. Can you give us some examples and educate the team on what you've seen there?
00:15:14.760 - 00:16:20.018, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly. So I wanted to acknowledge that over my years of participating in the blockchain space, the Filequin ecosystem is definitely one of the most collaborative open source communities. So first, thanks to you Stefan Protocol and Hack FS for inviting the Picnic team to today's panel quick intro. So Picnic is a San Diego headquartered cloud storage venture and our mission is to set the enterprise standard for web3 infrastructure so that all the blockchains of today they're not spinning up nodes and validating off of Amazon web services and using centralized infrastructure. So, to your point, Picnic, we are really lucky to be a part of numerous teams throughout the Filecoin ecosystem helping some of the coolest pioneers onboard their data sets onto Filecoin. So the first example that comes to mind is starling Lab, which is a joint venture between the University of Southern California Shoa Foundation and the Stanford Department of Engineering. And they aim to protect human history by leveraging Filecoin as the archival layer to their data stack.
00:16:20.018 - 00:16:55.866, Speaker B: So my team and I have been supporting them in preparing, among many various things, the movement of their data sets, the egress from where they are today, starting from tape storage. When you have petabytes of data, it's not easy to go digital, especially if you're talking at that scale. It's not easy to source the data of that scale. It's not easy to get it to the multiple storage providers. When we say 3000 on Filecoin, how do you get it to them across a blockchain network so that Starlink is able to enjoy decentralization and redundancy of copies. But it's going to happen. It's been happening.
00:16:55.866 - 00:17:10.262, Speaker B: It's been brilliant. So it's been really exciting time for all of us in the File community. I can think of so many other projects we're working on, but I'll cut it there so that we can share some time with other folks on the yeah, great.
00:17:10.316 - 00:17:47.330, Speaker C: Great. Kevin so basically, data management, like you said, right? And data onboarding, just like in other cloud offerings today, when you're moving petabytes in capacity, you want to move it fast. Sometimes sneaker net is the fastest way to do it. But the whole management, the data management aspect around that is where we see a lot of opportunity. I think that will sort of get disrupted as well. All the traditional tools today, by the way, charge a ton of money. Like if you go to some of the traditional, I don't want to call out any names, so I think there's a ton of opportunity there as well.
00:17:47.330 - 00:18:12.560, Speaker C: Stu thank you so much. Kevin stu, you have been an early adopter of Filecoin, right? And have extensive security networking experience. What recommendations do you have for the team here and for the audience when it comes to security networking in this space? I think you're on mute, too.
00:18:14.630 - 00:18:44.694, Speaker F: Somebody had to do that. So hopefully everyone's heard that yesterday there was a large break in to Polynetworks. It's a DFI provider, and there was $600 million worth of their stuff taken and most of it's been returned. It's an interesting story. So the security stuff is always in the news lately. I do want to break it down to some of the pieces. First of all, if we start with the actual blockchain and filecoin, that's been well proven.
00:18:44.694 - 00:19:25.186, Speaker F: It's been wholly tested. We don't see a security issue there, so we don't worry about that. But then we look at the different components, such as storage providers, like at Picnic. We have to be concerned about the physical security of the hardware. We have to be concerned about all the things that a normal provider would be concerned about. Denial of service attacks, protecting that inbound P to P connections into the network through some kind of firewall. Of course, you harden your OS, you protect all the systems that you're running so that your system is secure.
00:19:25.186 - 00:20:09.094, Speaker F: Then the other component is on the client side. And in our ecosystem, the client is the one sending data into the filecoin network to the storage provider. So that has to be protected. One of the big concerns we have, and I think the poly network breach tells you about protecting your wallets. So you have to do everything from making sure others can't access it, proper use of the wallets where you store them, and of course, protecting the keys and not losing the keys. So everything like you would expect from a normal operation, backups, backup of those keys, the wallets. And then on the network side, as Kevin mentioned, we're talking large volumes of data.
00:20:09.094 - 00:20:33.470, Speaker F: So if we just look at having to transfer a pebabyte of data, if you have a ten gigabit connection to the Internet, that takes about nine days to move a PIB. And on the internal side, the network requirements are even higher. We're typically looking at 40 to 100 gigabits per second internal connections because of the massive amounts of data. So hopefully that's a good overview.
00:20:34.770 - 00:21:09.610, Speaker C: Thank you. Yeah, no, great. Stuart, I think what you're highlighting is in every single stack, every single layer, every single step of implementing systems or a storage provider infrastructure, you see opportunity for improvement. Let's go back to Neo. So, Neo, where do you think the Web Three future leads or leaders should be focusing on and building out new businesses abroad? And maybe what's your view from IPFS means perspective?
00:21:12.030 - 00:22:24.350, Speaker D: Well, technically there are two types of tools application and infrastructure. I believe both of them are equally important to Web Three ecosystem. And on the current FICO network, there are a lot more capacity than storage. So it means that there is a huge amount of capacity, basically for free, for hackers to use if they choose to use a Web Three powered network with the free storage or even potentially negatively priced storage. Well, it's a fifth proposal that allows storage providers to set negative prices for verified storage deals and that will unlock lots of innovative applications or smart contracts that built directly on top of Ficoin network after PL as EVM or other VMs into FICO. As for the infrastructure, aside from the data management Kevin mentioned earlier, I believe as more and more storage providers start to take real storage deals, contract management tooling will become super handy. Especially for large scale storage providers.
00:22:24.350 - 00:23:29.590, Speaker D: Content filtering system will be essential as well. People will start to realize how important this is when the data is against local legislation. Lots of storage providers in China have this hesitation when they couldn't verify the data, so they just don't take storage deals at all. Also, like Huang mentioned earlier, the Composal defill could take market orders like bids, deals asks, and leverage a dex decentralized exchange to see how the market really values these orders. And with this sort of ability, the ecosystem will be able to begin come up with hardware futures. You could do futures on hard drives, SSCs and GPUs and so on, or even spacetime futures, which is wild as you could actually do futures on the storage contract themselves. I'm super excited to see what happens when that emerges.
00:23:31.850 - 00:24:21.850, Speaker C: Very cool. Yeah, no, I think you brought up some really good points like filtering data, qualifying data in an automated scalable way, guaranteeing that certain data is legit, et cetera. And then optimization all the way on the back end stack as well, like tuning for hardware. Definitely lots of opportunity chipsets, customized chipsets, all of that will eventually help us get ahead and provide more compute capabilities as well down the road. Thank you. So let's go back to Charles. So Charles, one of the things that you're a big proponent of this is how you're building the stack of services and are able to compete against hyperscaler.
00:24:21.850 - 00:24:35.500, Speaker C: So any suggestions and opportunities on where startups should focus on in helping the Falcon ecosystem in competing against the hyperscalers? You have some very specific talking tracks there. Let's go through it.
00:24:37.630 - 00:25:42.042, Speaker E: Yeah, we are very exciting to working with the Frycon network because we see that there are huge opportunities in the Frycon network. In my opinion, Frycon network for now is not just one of the biggest or even the biggest security network that also has numerous computing resource as well. Memory, GPU and CPU, they're all hyper performance servers. So with all those resources, we're actually not just building one of the largest storage network, we are also become one of the largest computing network across the world. Which means that potentially like fraternity network competing with all the existing cloud systems like AWS, Google and Azure, whatever. There are so many limitations about those centralized cloud systems. First, their source code is all closed source code, which means that you don't really know what they perform behind the scenes.
00:25:42.042 - 00:27:01.270, Speaker E: Did they take your data? Did they using your privacy for business purpose? Is your data really belong to yourself? When you want to retrieve your data, where you get it? All those questions you don't know, right? But with firecom, everything open source. You have any doubts, you can check the code. If you want to add something, you can write your own code and deploy on the network. So with this one also, as we said, we currently have almost 700 nodes which is active on the network you can reach and more than 200 nodes accepting data. Imagine how many data centers AWS and Google has just 20 data centers across the world. How many regions fragment reach? If you check the hack FS, by today we cross 18 time zone, we have more than 600 teams and we have so many storage providers across the world, we can build the largest decentralized storage and computing network. So for the lots of startups who want to join this great network, you can think about how can we change all the service current cloud service providers are doing to our network.
00:27:01.270 - 00:28:00.682, Speaker E: For example, live here they are doing the video live stream and transcoding, right? They can use the fragrance network, doing the fuel mining is ongoing like us. We're doing the storage providers with the FS three, trying to replace the current S three storage. And we're also building the HCOM building framework to replace the AWS snowbird, snow family services. And there are thousands of opportunities there. For example, the CDN services, the cloud front services, cloud monitoring services and other service like load and balancer service, all those applications which is currently provided by the AWS or other cloud services. We can do it on private network, which is even better. We have so many storage providers with verified data.
00:28:00.682 - 00:28:22.658, Speaker E: You get storage free. Can we get computing free as well in the future? I would say that's possible. We need a good economic model. We have more potential beauty. Think about the decentralized which is driving by the community economic model compared to those four profit only company. There's a huge advantage. And also trust.
00:28:22.658 - 00:28:40.730, Speaker E: We have more trust than them because we are open source code everybody. The storage is really your data is your data, your data is AWS. So those are the opportunities and focus I think the staff working on and growing the entire community and the network.
00:28:41.950 - 00:29:35.270, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you Charles. And one thing that I know you and I talked about this bet, and you mentioned it already, is the infrastructure as a service that you're looking to build right over time as a storage provider. So it's not just what we're seeing right now in the storage provider world is you're not just a FalcoIn storage provider, you're actually building extra services with other blockchains. And so you could look at all of our storage providers as the future managed service providers of the next decade that will have multiple stacks of blockchains collaboratively working in the same data center offering all sorts of services. But it all starts with getting that data first because that's where all the magic happens, right? So bringing them the compute close to the data, like you said, is quite interesting. The next question is for thank you Charles.
00:29:35.270 - 00:29:51.680, Speaker C: Very excited to see what your team is working on and what you will come out with next. Let's go to Kevin. So what are some of the problems you're seeing Kevin, and what are some of the business opportunities that you would recommend teams to focus on?
00:29:52.770 - 00:30:34.830, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really great question. So I think like Charles was saying, one of the panelists before me, it's about better integrations and architecting solutions that make sense to the market as it stands today. He fired off a lot of the big keywords, but a lot of the big players hyperscalers as part of the Web Three trend. Falcon is decentralized. It has different technological requirements to work. But there's this gap, it's this void where here's your Web Two user today, the folks who are used to using the hyperscalers. And then there are the Web Three technologies like Filecoin, and you have to traverse them if you're one of today's data generators or storage users.
00:30:34.830 - 00:31:07.638, Speaker B: We ourselves, all of us in this call, are used to these de facto cloud tools like S Three from Amazon or from the view of today's, I don't know, thousands, tens of thousands of storage architects. This admins everywhere, whether you're academic, whether you're government or private. I mean, we all use the same data, movers over and over the same few names. You've got Veeam backup. Restore. You've got Arclone Rubrik Net backup. And that's it, right there's so much business opportunity if an entrepreneur like one of you in the audience can bridge that gap that I mentioned.
00:31:07.638 - 00:31:23.006, Speaker B: So you can build the arsenal of tools that allow Web Two users to not even notice that they've migrated to Web Three. They've gotten over that void because they're now on Filecoin. It's just that seamless. Also on that note, another thing is.
00:31:23.028 - 00:31:55.366, Speaker G: Knowing how to use or interface with Filecoin or any Web Three technology. If you're used to web Two, they're proprietary, but you're used to them. The MSPs have gone out there, the trainers, the different big hyperscalers put out business development effort, training sessions for the different segments. But with web Three, with File form, you have to understand wallet management, token economics, et cetera. The list goes on. An entrepreneurial idea would be to just aggregate those new knowledge requirements into a new system role so that, again, the.
00:31:55.388 - 00:31:56.966, Speaker B: Web Two user doesn't even notice that.
00:31:56.988 - 00:32:25.940, Speaker G: They'Ve migrated to Web Three. They just know their data is decentralized. They can pay US dollars fiat to the File point storage provider, or et cetera, to Charles team, who integrates many different things where File phone is part of the offerings. And that's an entirely separate role in the Web Three ecosystem. And then I think the last thing I wanted to mention, you said the word opportunity. I think it's just tremendous. I wanted to take a step back and really paint how big cloud storage is.
00:32:27.190 - 00:32:49.560, Speaker C: Kevin, sorry to interrupt you. We hear a lot of static noise from the microphone. Not sure if you were on a roll there. I love that. By the way, I hate to interrupt you because you're making such a great topic there. Wait, so can you check your microphone quickly and then we'll try again?
00:32:50.810 - 00:32:52.330, Speaker B: Yeah. How's this?
00:32:52.400 - 00:32:53.930, Speaker C: Oh, perfect. Awesome.
00:32:54.080 - 00:33:13.038, Speaker B: Okay. Yes. My apologies. I just wanted to make sure I made that point for all of you in the audience. One of the most incredible opportunities just disaggregating into a new role the ability to put all the new knowledge requirements. And supporting folks who go from web two to web3 seamlessly. I think that was the last point.
00:33:13.038 - 00:33:47.222, Speaker B: Hopefully I made that clear. And then just stefan, I think my last point was you mentioned the word opportunity coming from the traditional Wall Street world management, consulting, private equity. I always think about market opportunity. Take just a really quick step back and really paint how big cloud storage of an opportunity that is. Okay, so today's, public government, private clouds, it's approximately 100,000 exabytes stored. That's insane. In four years, that number is at least going to double to 200,000, according to some of the key research groups like Cybersecurity Ventures, Allied Markets and Markets.
00:33:47.222 - 00:34:11.650, Speaker B: I mean, the estimates, like in 2027, 2028, cloud storage is going to mark. It's going to pass the 300 billion dollar mark. That's like a kegr on the order of something 22, 23%. Just think about that, folks. Even if web3 is slow to take off, which it's not, right? You've heard Neo, his team's been around for what, a little over a year, two years. That since testnet to mainnet, they're at 200, 300 petabytes. The growth is incredible.
00:34:11.650 - 00:34:29.960, Speaker B: But even if it's slow to take off, which it's not, filecoin is just a small fraction, which it's not, the addressable market will still be a massive 100 billion dollar opportunity for entrepreneurs who help web Two move to web Three. So I implore all of you, just take a bite of that opportunity and seriously just pack away at it.
00:34:34.650 - 00:34:54.014, Speaker C: Very cool. Thank you, Kevin. Couldn't agree more. Next question is for Stu. People ask sometimes, why does Filecoin not have built in encryption in the stack? What's your response to that? Because sure you have an opinion on that? Yeah, absolutely.
00:34:54.132 - 00:35:38.218, Speaker F: So I think the question is a little more complicated than people know. When I hear the question like, why don't you encrypt data? Well, there's really four actors in this ecosystem. There's the protocol itself, right? The filecoin protocol. And when you look at the purpose, the purpose is you can store data in a decentralized manner around the world and then people can retrieve decentralized storage platform. The other two actors, though, are the client and what I'll call the customer. So the client is that piece that accepts the customer data and then processes it and sends it to the storage provider. And there's an opportunity, there's a business opportunity in terms of managing those client relationships and expectations.
00:35:38.218 - 00:36:28.270, Speaker F: And so if you want to encrypt there, that could be encrypted and sent to the storage miner as an encrypted blob, right, that we simply store, and then they can manage their permissions in terms of who can access this, who gets the key, how do they get the key? And finally, the customer, the ones that we've spoken to, actually don't want to use encryption, even though they do have sensitive data that they don't want to be publicly exposed because they're afraid of a single point of failure where something happens to that key all of a sudden, where's our data, who's got the key? It has to be managed properly so they don't want to take that chance. So it's really up to the customer and the client to decide how to negotiate those requirements and then where that encryption, if it's to happen, where it happens and how it gets managed.
00:36:31.620 - 00:37:19.168, Speaker C: Yeah, really cool. Yeah, I think like you said right, there's an opportunity again in every stage and even different encryption technologies can be added on the front or on the back. And I think, again, it's an example of how we think about the ecosystem, how we believe innovation will happen over time and will change over time across the ecosystem. Great. Unfortunately we're at time here, but I wanted to make sure if there's any questions in the chat, we have a couple more questions lined up too, but we're going to get ready for the next panel session. In the meantime, I'm going to pass it on to Kardik who's going to look at some other questions that came in through the chat and I will be back with you in two minutes. In the meantime, Kartik, take it away.
00:37:19.168 - 00:37:24.210, Speaker C: Thanks everyone for joining at least on the panel session and I'll be back in two.
00:37:24.900 - 00:38:11.090, Speaker A: Well, that was an incredible talk and so many amazing points here. We'll give anybody who has any questions on the chat, feel free to kind of type them in. We'll relay those questions to our speakers and I saw some really interesting points here and I was going to still ask you to kind of keep all your video on. So maybe one question for everybody until we receive a few more questions here are just in terms of you kind of talked about, you covered a lot of opportunities that are here, whether it's on the opportunity of the space itself on storage or kind of ancillary tools around it. But what specifically I guess keeps you up at night and what do you worry about. And maybe I'll start this with Charles and then we can go to Kevin. But what kind of are things that you're concerned about as this ecosystem grows and what matters on that side?
00:38:14.900 - 00:39:05.244, Speaker E: Yeah, for me with the network currently, let's remember that Frycoin is mainly online just one year, not even one year yet. So there was still lots of infrastructure protocol layers. It keep on evolving. So when startups start their design and linear to feel kind about long term, we kind of like we start a project, we expect it's perfect, then it will make it works as your course. So that's what I see that for some young developers, young startups, they coming here very excited and said, oh, this is not paid. Oh, that is a pay. This startup feels like a little distress.
00:39:05.244 - 00:40:12.390, Speaker E: So what I see is that if you think something is not there you can do two things one thing is that you have building open sources, building libraries from the core operators and open source to the others so we can make the network and to evolve fast. Another thing that always thinking about long term, like when you're writing code or you're doing this, how about others use it? Is this a real need or this just because I like it, I think it will be great but where's real need, always do some research before you start. This is something I'm thinking another part is about security. When we're doing those applications we are aiming at for industry usage where industry user accepts those solutions about security side, I see that a lot of application is great but they don't think about security. For example, how to protect our customer data, how about some legal things? Those things are really concerned about it.
00:40:12.760 - 00:40:22.888, Speaker A: Kevin, I see is an active engagement going on in the chat here with you and a few of our attendees. So maybe I'll ask you here as well for the live stream, what keeps you up at night?
00:40:23.054 - 00:41:25.384, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if you were reading the live stream and then asked a question so perfect, the first thing that comes to mind, I mean, just to make it clear for all of us who don't understand that saying, it's generally a negative connotation what's keeping you up at night? We're all working so hard in the hacking community and so hard in the Web Three community to make decentralization work for cloud storage or even more aggressive goals, cloud compute, et cetera. The existing infrastructure today when we colloquially call it Web Two, that has had so much maturity from different legal jurisdictions, from security. And it's not just a matter of ethics or legislation. There's also been so much work to functionally, technically keep systems going in ways that provide the security and comfort to its users in the mean, I think. Vibov, thanks for being so active. Vibov mentioned role based access management. I mean RBAC's control that doesn't really exist today because we're hacking so quickly, we're building so quickly, at least getting the capacity up, but we also have to make sure that we're covering our bases.
00:41:25.384 - 00:41:58.440, Speaker B: It's not just a liability thing but to encourage users, you have to protect them in their data. And so what keeps me up at night and a better spin on it would be what's the opportunity here would be for hackers in the community to see that there's a need to bring the same professionalism, the same security standards, but somehow be creative and allow it to work on a decentralized platform like Filecoin. So I think that's my answer and that's a huge opportunity, not my expertise, but I'm sure someone in the audience will be great for it if not is already working at it.
00:41:58.590 - 00:42:08.188, Speaker A: Absolutely and I think this sort of overlaps with what you just commented on Stuart with encryption in this space. So maybe I'll let you comment as well and then we'll go to Neo and wrap it up.
00:42:08.354 - 00:42:12.776, Speaker F: Sure. Comment on encryption or security. It's music in my ears.
00:42:12.808 - 00:42:17.520, Speaker A: Everyone's talking about security either or the question still stays. What keeps you up.
00:42:17.590 - 00:42:17.872, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:17.926 - 00:43:09.328, Speaker F: So I always try to understand the risks and balance them. Right. So it's really about managing the risk, so trying to understand what those risks are. Right now, I would say a lot of our attention is turning toward government regulations, some of the hearings in the Senate and the new amendments being proposed or passed, those present. Of course, the kind of risks that we need to be concerned about and how that affects us, as opposed to kind of the traditional infrastructure and application type of risks that we always have to worry about. So that would be my answers, just what's out there, what's coming, and how's the environment constantly changing. As somebody who's worked a lot in the enterprise space, I continue to evangelize the fact that the blockchain technology offers us far more security than the Web two way of doing things.
00:43:09.328 - 00:43:36.970, Speaker F: I spend millions of dollars trying to protect what is in some ways unprotectable. There's just so many rooms for you to get hacked, often at a social level, not just a code level. So seeing a protocol like filecoin or other blockchains where the security is built into the protocol and you don't count on people you can trust. Right. It's really a trustless system. So now we're looking outside the protocol, right. Off chain problems.
00:43:38.140 - 00:43:43.790, Speaker A: Absolutely. And Neo, maybe close this off. Love to hear your thoughts as yes, yes.
00:43:44.240 - 00:44:38.332, Speaker D: I think you guys got almost everything covered. What keeps me at night? Well, that's actually a classic interview question. One of the proper answer is, aside from occasional nightmares about interviewing, I work so hard that I rarely have a difficult time sleeping. But when you ask that question to executives, you might get answers like team dynamics, talent issue, corporate culture, and people related issues. But for me, the real answer is how to achieve effective communication when our team is distributed in different regions with different time zones. I personally started working remotely from four years ago and way before the COVID pandemic, but still try to improve on high effective communication. I think Protocol Lab seems really good at this.
00:44:38.332 - 00:44:44.450, Speaker D: And ethereum global. Steven, do you have any tricks to share?
00:44:48.820 - 00:44:50.384, Speaker C: Neo? That's that me.
00:44:50.582 - 00:44:51.808, Speaker D: Yes, that's you.
00:44:51.894 - 00:45:35.008, Speaker C: Yes. Jumping in tricks, I think keep building the community as strong as possible. I'm a strong believer that innovation comes through throwing ideas at each other and collaboratively working on and brainstorming on doing things in a new way. And I feel like some of the greatest ideas just come drinking a beer or just when you're not really focused on brainstorming, but when you're just trying to make something work by really solving a problem. I think that's why we're so huge on hackathons. That's why we're so huge on accelerated programs and huge on building this together with the ecosystem. So I want to thank you all for coming.
00:45:35.008 - 00:45:40.510, Speaker C: Great conversation again. We should do more of these. I hope this was helpful to the community.
