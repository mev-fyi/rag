00:00:07.450 - 00:00:53.818, Speaker A: Who of you are considering Starnet for hacking? Nobody is considering Starnet for hacking. What's up? I want to tell you something very interesting, that a lot of hackers come and they build something on EVM compatible networks so they can aim for several prices. But, you know, I was talking with the scroll guys, and they received 70 submissions, stuff like that. You know how many submissions we receive in Starnet? Five for four prices. So that's very usual. So if you want to maximize your chances of winning a price, I think Starnet is a good option. We have ten k for four different prices, and we should receive between three to six submissions.
00:00:53.818 - 00:01:26.614, Speaker A: So there's a high chance that if you have with Starnet, you can maximize your chance of earning some price. And also you can be one of these hackers that are out actually staying in the blockchain ecosystem. So basically, this table is the number of full time developers that are in different networks, blockchain networks, and it's very bad. Ethereum lost a lot of developers. Polkadot, Cosmos, bitcoin, whatever you want, except for starnet. Starnet is only winning developers. So we are more and more and more and more.
00:01:26.614 - 00:01:50.234, Speaker A: So again, you want to win a prize today, you have a good chance with Starnet. This is by the developer report. It's a report by Electric Capital. So if you want to win a prize today, you have a good chance with Starnet. Why? Because there are not a lot of submissions. Second, you can be one of these developers that are actually pushing the blockchain right now. So everybody is losing developers except for Starnet.
00:01:50.234 - 00:02:09.320, Speaker A: That is actually winning. Some developers. So feel for more than welcome to come. And also something that is not very known is that Starnet has the biggest number of developers overall from all the layer. Yes. What this shows is that Starnet is not that hard to use. Kyrie is not that hard to use.
00:02:09.320 - 00:02:48.518, Speaker A: We have a lot of developers more than the other EVM compatible options. So, yeah, if they can do it, I think that you can do it, no problem. And basically, you know what we're doing, we are a layer two. So we're trying to make as cheap and as fast as possible Ethereum. But at the same time, we also provide options that are not available in the EVM ecosystem, like native account abstraction. So it's something that I think if you build something with account obstruction, which is not that difficult, and it's very cool, you have a nice chance of winning a price. So what we have is basically account structure.
00:02:48.518 - 00:03:30.126, Speaker A: You can do who knows what account structure is here who has coded something with account construction before? Okay, perfect. So account structure installing is very simple. You need to implement these two different functions, execute and validate. I will give you a link where you can see more about how to do it. So if you want to implement an account contract with storage using account construction, you have a nice chance of winning. So I will give you the sources where you can learn how to do it. But basically, account obstruction is changing all the blockchain ecosystem, not only for the hackathon, but I think that it's good for you if you want to stay in the blockchain ecosystem building account abstraction, it's very cool.
00:03:30.126 - 00:04:19.994, Speaker A: You can use other types of signing transactions, not only signing using the stark elliptic core that we use in starnet, you can also use other elliptic cores such as ethereums, bitcoins, the elliptic core used in your cell phone, in your iPhone, in your Android. So this makes transactions very secure. So it's the next level of security for wallets. So I think it's also a good opportunity and it's not that hard to use. I think that you can implement it. I will show you where you can learn about it. Also, if you want to create autonomous worlds or on chain games, we have doyo, which is, I'm forgetting the name of the game building engine in Soliti, so the equivalent is Doyo in Starnet.
00:04:19.994 - 00:05:02.946, Speaker A: So we have a lot of hackers right now that know doyo that can support you on how to build games or autonomous worlds in starnet. So you can use doyo, you can use GSA if you're interested in on chain machine learning. So they have several issues. And I can also connect you with the people from GSa in case you want to implement something with their framework so they can support you. So machine learning with zero knowledge, very cool. Herodotus is also, we have them here also. So if you want to use them to do storage proofs, like proof ownership of an L, one asset on layer two, you can also do it Kakarot, which is also a serial GVM on top of Starknet.
00:05:02.946 - 00:05:46.394, Speaker A: So it's also interesting. And we have the guys here, so there's a lot of stuff that you can choose from what to build. Basically I will share you a link. So the link on the left is the starnet book, which is your, if you want a good chance of winning the hackathon, you can follow the starnet book, which is on the left. The Cairo book will be if you want to get deeper into Cairo, which I don't think you will have a lot of time if you don't know Cairo yet, but with the basics of Cairo, you can build a kind of structure and that kind of stuff, and we can also help you. But if you want to go into Cairo, you can also check the Cairo book. So the left one is the starting book and this is the Cairo book.
00:05:46.394 - 00:06:09.090, Speaker A: And from the start book you can go into the getting started chapter, is the chapter number one. And you can basically use remix as remix and open zipline contracts as if you were coding with solidity. So this is remix here. Remix. I have a small smart contract called ownable. It's a simple smart contract. This is Cairo.
00:06:09.090 - 00:06:37.610, Speaker A: I won't go into the details of Cairo right now, but it's not that hard. I think most of you can already, as hackers you can already know what is happening. We have a trait that is an interface. So it basically defines two function transfer, ownership and get owner. It receives these arguments and then it returns this one. It's very intuitive. If you're a developer, which I think most of you are, then we have the actual smart contract.
00:06:37.610 - 00:07:00.334, Speaker A: This is an event. This is the definition of an event. Then we have the storage constructor and the external functions, the read and write functions. It's basically exactly the same concepts as with solidity and ethereum. So nothing new. The new thing here is the syntax. And you can code your smart contract here in remix.
00:07:00.334 - 00:07:24.010, Speaker A: And you can deploy it from here, you can compile it from here. So if you know how to use remix, that's all you need. So for example here, what I'm going to do is go into the plugin of a starnet. You can go into plugins, starnet. Here's the plugin from starnet. You can activate it and then you will have this. So I can compile my contract.
00:07:24.010 - 00:07:55.410, Speaker A: Compile contract. So it's compiling to Sierra, which is kind of like a jewel from Cairo. It will give you a couple warnings, whatever. And it's compiling it and it's compiled now we can deploy it. Your project can be on Devnet or can be on testnet however you want. But for example, now I will deploy it on Testnet. Sorry, on Devnet.
00:07:55.410 - 00:08:28.270, Speaker A: Let's do it in Testnet. Let's write. So I will go to test accounts. Well, you can deploy your own account here using account abstraction, by the way, but I am not seeing the option to connect my argents. Well, no problem. I will deploy it locally here on the Devnet. So basically I will go into environment.
00:08:28.270 - 00:08:54.690, Speaker A: I don't know where the definite options. I don't like very much the remix, how it looks. It's kind of confusing, but environment. Okay, here's the remote. Definite. Let me try again. Wallet.
00:08:54.690 - 00:09:25.960, Speaker A: Okay, now I can with wallet. I don't know why it wasn't appearing to me. So I can choose my argent. I need to set up my way. It's occupying the whole of my screen. Sorry, just a second. I will disconnect the.
00:09:25.960 - 00:10:22.410, Speaker A: Sorry for these technical problems. Sorry, just a second. I'm just trying to debug this live. But basically what you can do is deploy it on the testnet. I will show you in a minute and then you can start interacting with it. Everything that you need will be in the start book isofi from there. Sorry, mix is being not nice today for me.
00:10:22.410 - 00:11:15.640, Speaker A: Okay, let me make a second try. Okay, now I think I can. Okay, Perfect. Sorry for the brief technical issues on the phone. I cannot. I don't know if I updated my Mac to Sonoma today. I know if it's the problem, I cannot move it here, but I can move it there.
00:11:15.640 - 00:11:43.840, Speaker A: Well, I will do it like this. But basically what you have here, your remix, and I cannot click. I was excited about Sonoma. No, it's not working. My computer. Sorry for that, folks. I have a couple more minutes.
00:11:43.840 - 00:12:23.434, Speaker A: The problem here is that I updated my MacBook yesterday to the new Sonoma. So big mistake. I think you need always to wait a couple of versions, but if you have any questions, let me know right now and we can do questions. My computer will not work on time, but do you have any questions? I can provide you more resources. On the booth, we have a boot. And yes, again, as a summary, you have a big chance of winning a standard prize. For those that just came, we have four prizes, ten k in total for about five to six submissions, usually.
00:12:23.434 - 00:12:52.574, Speaker A: So you have a big chance of winning something with the starnet. So get into it, try it, and just let me know. We are several developers from Star wars and the Starnet foundation. We are there in the booth, so let me know and we can help you in whatever you need. Do you have any questions? Sorry for the issues here. Any questions on starnet Cairo? Okay, if you can come, I can also show you how to create an account contract using account. Yep.
00:12:52.574 - 00:12:53.040, Speaker A: Thank you.
