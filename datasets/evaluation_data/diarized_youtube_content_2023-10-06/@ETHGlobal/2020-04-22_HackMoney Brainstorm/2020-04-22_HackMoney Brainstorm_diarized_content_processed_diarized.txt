00:00:20.640 - 00:01:29.468, Speaker A: And one more minute. Okay. Julian will be joining. Good. Julian, hello. Yes. So you had because I don't use Zoom, so I had some difficulties to join.
00:01:29.468 - 00:01:42.582, Speaker A: Sorry about that. Awesome. All right, so I just need one more second to figure out the live.
00:01:42.636 - 00:01:43.350, Speaker B: Stream.
00:01:45.610 - 00:03:08.524, Speaker A: And then we will go live all it. Thank you, everybody, for tuning in again. I know we have people from all over the world, morning, afternoon, night, whatever it is. All right, Andrew, if you just want to check, it looks like we're live on YouTube, so if you could just double check that and then I will double check on Twitter. Thanks for bearing with me, everybody. And it's been five minutes, so we'll get started shortly. Wow, 59 people have showed up.
00:03:08.524 - 00:03:52.810, Speaker A: That's a really great turnout. I think we had 120 people register. That's awesome. Yeah. All right, unless there are any final hiccups, I think we'll get started. Awesome. I didn't hear any protests, so we're going to get going.
00:03:52.810 - 00:04:43.362, Speaker A: So, everybody, thank you so much for joining this Hack Money brainstorm. If you didn't know, this is an event specifically linked to Hack Money, which is ETH Global's very first online DeFi hackathon. Now, if you don't know who ETH Global is, we're an organization that does events around the world, and in the past, they've always been in person physical events. We will get a bunch of sponsors, get hackers to come for a weekend and build awesome things. But again, like I said, this is our first virtual event and we're super excited. So what we're going to do today is just we have three awesome guests. Got Scott Lewis from dexag.
00:04:43.362 - 00:05:43.010, Speaker A: D five pulse. We have Julian, butil tell me how to pronounce it. Julian, did you fall out? We have Julian from State Capital and Tina Shen from a bunch of projects. You can say whichever one you'd like to be associated with. Are you guys muted? I can't tell. Bear with me one moment. Tina want to make sure our speakers can actually yeah, I think we're here, maybe.
00:05:43.010 - 00:06:15.230, Speaker A: All right, Tina had her hand raised. There we go. Tina cool. Yeah. Okay, cool. Sorry about that. Yeah, like I said, Hack Money starts this Friday, and this event is part of that, getting people in the hacking mode, the DeFi Money mode, and we're super excited to have all of these people who've joined us.
00:06:15.230 - 00:06:48.360, Speaker A: So if I left anything out, I just want to give a quick minute for the speakers to introduce themselves and talk about what they're working on. Scott, if you want to start us off. Yeah, I'm scott. We're working on DeFi, pulse and dex AZ, which is a dexag reader and FGAs station. Awesome. Tina?
00:06:50.700 - 00:07:12.800, Speaker B: I'm working on one of my previous East Global hackathon winning project. It was called Heshedge from East Singapore. And I'm working on it through a flash organization method, like a prolonged hackathon with project milestone driven goals.
00:07:15.620 - 00:08:13.200, Speaker A: Julian. Yeah, so I'm Julian. I'm working behind Stack capital and stackdow So we do Staking as a service liquidity provider, market maker and Arbitrage. Awesome. So I figured before we dive in, now that we have everybody's background and which products they're working on, just a couple intro questions to get people thinking about it. What would you say is your favorite under the radar DeFi project? We know all of you guys are really in tune with the ecosystem. What would you say if you had to pick one? What's like a newer project that not many people would know about? I really like Real Tea, which is tokenizing real estate.
00:08:13.200 - 00:08:32.650, Speaker A: The market they're in, they can't really be fully decentralized tokenizing US real estate. But kind of bridging the chasm between real world assets and Ethereum on chain assets is I think, pretty important to the future of DeFi. And they're doing it. Yeah.
00:08:35.900 - 00:09:03.250, Speaker B: I really like macdex IO. It's new per swap. It just rolled out its new per swap on East Die pair. It actually utilizes AMM and in combination of an order book to set the price, it's purely on chain. I see. So very clever design.
00:09:03.800 - 00:09:06.660, Speaker A: Is that the one that's spelled MCDEX?
00:09:07.080 - 00:09:08.928, Speaker B: Oh yeah, MCDEX.
00:09:09.024 - 00:09:12.512, Speaker A: Okay. But it's pronounced MCDEX. Like McDonald's.
00:09:12.656 - 00:09:14.310, Speaker B: Yeah, kind of.
00:09:16.460 - 00:10:14.552, Speaker A: Okay. Anything? Well, I like Balancer if we stay on a DeFi, more like DeFi economic space. I like balancer because it's a mix between uniswap and set protocol. So you got auto market maker attached to the system and you also have auto balancing across different assets. So I think it's very interesting all the projects like Curve Finance as well, but it's probably not very under at the moment. And also all the different projects that are trying to integrate BTC. So for example, like TBTC, I think this will be a massive opportunity for the Ethereum space to bring liquidity from bitcoin market.
00:10:14.552 - 00:10:56.772, Speaker A: So I like all the different projects that are building that tokenizing bitcoin into Ethereum network. Yeah, and it seems like there's a new one almost every day, some tokenized version. So it'll be very interesting to see the trade offs that each of them makes or the different design decisions. There's certainly a really wide design space people can attack there. Not attacking the negative sense. Awesome. Okay, and then maybe one more icebreaker if you're comfortable sharing.
00:10:56.772 - 00:11:27.200, Speaker A: I'll go first. What is the largest amount or the silliest way you've messed up sending money on Ethereum? I remember I've tried to send ETH between main net and testnets before and I'm pretty sure that ETH is gone forever. I sent it to an improper contract. I'm sure everybody's lost money in some way, but I'm just curious if you're comfortable sharing.
00:11:28.660 - 00:11:32.240, Speaker B: I think you just reminded me of one. I did that too.
00:11:32.390 - 00:12:20.016, Speaker A: Yeah. Sending between test nets. Yeah, I've done that. Yeah, I don't want to DOX yeah, mine's like really silly, but it might be unique enough that I might DOX one of my addresses. Basically just having to do something at a later time and then forgetting to do that thing and losing all the monies. But it wasn't that much money, which was lucky, but it made up for the low amount of money it was with the sheer stupidity it took to lose money that way. For me, it was very simple.
00:12:20.016 - 00:12:35.204, Speaker A: I use a paper wallet, but then I lost the paper. An old school mistake. Those are allowed. Those are allowed. Cool. All right, thanks for playing along, guys. All right, let's dive into it.
00:12:35.204 - 00:13:21.920, Speaker A: So this hackathon is 30 days, which means people are going to have an opportunity to build a lot longer. Whereas, like I mentioned, previous events were two days, two nights. And you're just kind of like going, going this is 30 days where you're going to have time to iterate. You're going to have time to maybe hit some dead ends, restart it's. A lot more time to explore and build something that's going to last beyond just the event itself. I'll just list off the sponsors we have so far and maybe that'll help to because they will be offering some sponsor prizes and that'll help to frame the discussion we're going to have. So we have ave compound.
00:13:21.920 - 00:14:16.408, Speaker A: We just added Uniswap, uma, ENS chainlink and P tokens. So those are the projects we have as sponsors and they're going to be offering prizes so we can talk about things that will integrate them. We also have this spreadsheet that we've been adding to called Uterine level ideas for hack money. I'll drop that in the chat. And if anybody doesn't know, this is actually Liam Horn from East Global. He actually made this the other day and it's referencing something from a few years ago, I believe called musk level ideas, musk level engineering ideas. So we're trying to make our own version of that, Buterin level ideas for hack money.
00:14:16.408 - 00:14:47.570, Speaker A: And it's got a bunch of different things on there. But yeah, now that we have the idea of who the sponsors are and a link to that spreadsheet, I'll just open it up to Scott or Julian or Tina. If you want to just talk about things you've been thinking, go through. I put a few ideas down there. I could go through them real quick. Is that what you want? Sure. Okay.
00:14:47.570 - 00:15:52.310, Speaker A: So the first idea that I put down there that I thought would be cool is this sort of a growing I think when Ethereum first started, everyone just made open source code and it had permissive licenses on it and they deployed it on blockchain on the chain. And that was pretty good for other builders because you could look at the code. If there are parts of that code that you want to use, you could put them in your DAP. But now we're seeing more projects having proprietary code on chain. And I think if you are a miner with broad interest in the space and then later a staking pool with broad interest in the space. When people do open source their code, it's better for the whole ecosystem. So if I have a long term interest in the ecosystem succeeding, I might want incentives so that people do that.
00:15:52.310 - 00:16:44.630, Speaker A: And so if you had an NFT that let people put their open source license on chain, you could apply a differential gas price to contracts with open source licenses or proprietary contracts. So if you want to keep your code proprietary, you can. But some block creators might have a little higher standard to get your transactions in the block. And I think it might be cool because you could sell the NFTs to projects that want to add them. And then if you could get block creators to buy into the idea, there might be an incentive and a little bit of a sustainable business around that. I think that would be cool. I think a lot of people in the space might be interested in that.
00:16:44.630 - 00:17:22.128, Speaker A: Another idea is a debugger for package transactions. Sometimes it's a little hard to tell what part of a transaction failed and if there's a way to solve that problem, I think a lot of people would want to see that and they might pay a fee for yeah, I'll let Gina or Julian if they have any ideas they want to go first. Yeah, go ahead.
00:17:22.294 - 00:17:27.350, Speaker B: Oh, I said you want to go first. I have too many sharp right now.
00:17:37.260 - 00:18:20.180, Speaker A: Okay. So I think for me, like having a system where you can swap or you can list all the different physical assets. So for example VLT and you could basically have different project based on physical assets that you can see all the different yield. That would be pretty cool. So for example like tokenized carbon offset or real estate or anything like that, a platform where you can list all the different physical assets, then comparing all the different and that would be pretty cool. Well, let me just click on open the doc if you want to go. Tina.
00:18:21.880 - 00:19:58.950, Speaker B: Yeah. So I've been thinking about a lot about various type of DAOs. I think right now there's enough money in DeFi at stake and there's enough primitives ready available. But what is more or less missing is kind of like the playbook of how to organize participation both in terms of capital. One of the idea is basically using essentially create a dow for transaction reorganizing retinization alliance because we and it's kind of inevitable. So can we front run the miners and actually protecting ourselves in an alliance way through economic incentive design so that's one which is DeFi related because only DeFi has enough money at stake to justify such. And the other idea that I had was kind of so now that we saw projects like compound rolling out comp token and there are very nice properties associated with it.
00:19:58.950 - 00:21:49.000, Speaker B: One of my view is that we saw a lot of the primitives start to have some kind of nationalistic or regional boundaries. But why don't we leave the politics to the Taos who participate in such governance to express your affiliation like your views rather than to have it on the protocol level. Let a protocol to be neutral and let the Dows to play out the politics. Like different kind of viewpoint in either governance, like for example, certain views I meant either from certain decisions to be more decentralized or less decentralized like things like that. But to organize express views through various DAOs and to have the DAOs participate in governance, that's another thing that I've been kind of thinking about. And lastly, I guess it has a bit less to do with DeFi but more to do with using certain gamified incentive designs to better organize product development such as an elongated kind of always ongoing hackathon style product development. I'm trying to design and apply this to my own project that was essentially an extension from my East Global project.
00:21:49.000 - 00:23:22.772, Speaker B: So like what I called essentially a continuous organization that is basically set by project milestone. But then essentially we automate a putable equity type of incentive design for each project milestone. So like V one we have this group of hackers joining force together to get to this goal and V Two we reorg into and people have more optionality to reshuffle the formation and so on. So there's a multi round game. However, in each round, basically can write instead of a call option type, which is the typical corporation stock option type of you choose to essentially exercise later, but then instead you upfront in opting into this 36 hours or hackathon mode or one month hackathon phase by opting in saying that, yes, I accept to take this token that is assigned to me if I and this project complete. Meet the milestone. But I can also opt to exit through exit to catch to cash like a cop out option within a limited period of time.
00:23:22.772 - 00:23:36.170, Speaker B: So that leaves flexibility for new more interested people to join at every single product phase and it's a self like iterative self selective process. So those are the things that I've been mostly thinking about.
00:23:39.650 - 00:23:52.420, Speaker A: Awesome. Those are some pretty big ideas. So for the Dao idea, are you specifically pulling that from compound's governance or is this a generalizable? It can be applied to any.
00:23:56.390 - 00:24:47.970, Speaker B: So first of all, I have to attribute part of this idea to Robert from Compound because he was one of I think both of Compound design and he mentioned down the road would be kind of cool. And that kind of went along with my line of thinking in terms of DAOs participation in what DAOs means for DeFi. I do believe that Dows will actually be we will see very meaningful innovation on DAOs like last year, we see a lot of concept but there's nothing to be governed or not enough to be governed and there's not enough of infrastructure available. And so that this year we're going to see more playbooks. So I do think that that idea I mentioned specifically has a requirement when it comes to the token design and compound token supports that, but I do think that it's definitely generalizable.
00:24:48.950 - 00:25:37.856, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Julian, did you have anything? Oh, you're still muted. I think once you mute you can't unmute. Okay, yeah. If people could actually build like a simple UI using Flash loan to swap interest yield across different platforms. So we could have for example, Ave or Compound or could also be using TBTC, but basically will be a system that can track the best yield.
00:25:37.856 - 00:27:06.690, Speaker A: Something like I earn, but more like in a simple mechanism where you just have Flash loan enabled and you just click and then swap your different interest yield. So for example, like DeFi saver the website that allow you to close your loan from Maker. Or maybe you could basically build something a little bit more advanced where you can swap interest rates across all these different projects. And this will be not very difficult using a Flash loan and you could charge a fee. Other interest rate swaps recently officially built, like people have been using them or just like as an idea because I've seen them and I use them, but I use my own implementation, but I haven't seen any UI for people that have no technical expertise and they can do it themselves. Okay, so you're just thinking of a very simple, easy to access UI. Yeah, because for example, the moment you can collateralize ETH or Maker to print dai and then you can use those die to earn interest on Javi for example.
00:27:06.690 - 00:28:37.780, Speaker A: But then if you want to close you if you lose those die or if you invest those die in another mechanism, then you need to reimburse the loan. And there's no system where you can also cross, for example, if you have like compound and then other DeFi yield system, you cannot really move those different assets across those different platforms right now. But maybe I'm wrong, but I haven't seen them yet. Scott, tina, any thoughts on that? Or have you seen anything like this implemented? Because then people could actually provide if it's a Flash loan, then obviously we'll be using like for example, Ave or other Flash loan built. But then you could also have a pool where people provide liquidity for people that want to swap their interest and then you could charge a fee on that liquidity. So it will be like kind of like a pool of liquidity for people to earn a yield for people that want to swap or close their loan. This one is probably for compound, but I'm thinking like make it more generic where you can just have it built for all the different yield platforms.
00:28:37.780 - 00:29:40.366, Speaker A: Robin, are you able to talk now? Do you want to talk a little bit about yeah, go ahead. We've built website called Defresh and we use Ave Fresh loan. You don't need to repay your loan first. You can just swap your collateral from maybe Die to Ether and you don't need to prepare upfront capital. Yeah, very cool. It's just for compound, right? Yeah. Cool.
00:29:40.548 - 00:30:30.986, Speaker B: Well, I've definitely seen quite a few interest rate swap projects because I think ever since East Berlin last year, intracell swap has been like a hot topic and everyone's quite different. And of course, the integration part is kind of no one has really explored. So I think that would be an interesting idea to actually put together. But definitely recent IRS projects. There's a swap net that's coming up. Not sure how their light paper is out and you guys can check it out right now. It implemented its light version because it has an AMM to price its pool.
00:30:30.986 - 00:30:52.310, Speaker B: And similarly, I think that 88 mph is I haven't really played around with it much, but it had some interesting structure when it comes to the interest, the fixed rate interest plant.
00:30:56.490 - 00:31:34.366, Speaker A: Can I just give me a wave. Anybody who's on the call who is applied to hack money and they're planning on building something, just wave at me. I'm just curious. All right, so that's like maybe half, maybe more than half, which is really awesome to see. So, as the title of this event would suggest, this is a Hack Money Brainstorm. So I'm going to open it up to anybody who would like to ask for feedback on their idea. Again, ask for feedback.
00:31:34.366 - 00:32:39.190, Speaker A: I don't want you to just kind of go for ten minutes talking about your concept, and then maybe Scott, Julian or Tina can give a little bit of feedback or talk about what they think about that going to if you want to speak or talk about your idea, just raise your hand and then I can unmute you. Start with hadrian. Go ahead. Hey. Hello, everyone. So, just very quickly, my idea was called Non Fungible Wallet and the base idea is to join the NFT world and smart contract wallets world by allowing you to generate a wallet that will act as an NFD. That way you can transfer it so you can use it to put many things into it, like, ERC 20s, ERC, 721, create a bundle of asset and then use the NFT property to move this bundle and maybe use it for collateral through mechanism like Crockett.
00:32:39.190 - 00:33:14.660, Speaker A: Yeah, Hadrian, I think that's pretty cool. I guess then you'd be able to tokenize the wallet on top of that. Yeah, the wallet would be a token. Yeah. I might say two things. First, I think that's really cool for kind of getting a transferable portfolio of stuff. That might be a fun thing to put my crypto punks in.
00:33:14.660 - 00:34:04.020, Speaker A: The other thing I might suggest is if it could use both NFTs and regular ERC 20s. Kind of like just have both of them in there. That might be pretty cool because I think tokenizing an arbitrary basket of ERC 20s might also be a nice thing to have that maybe isn't quite as usable. Yeah, the wallet would be an address, so it could own basically anything. Your wallet could even take part of a protocol. Yeah, no, I think that's an interesting idea. Awesome.
00:34:04.020 - 00:34:51.294, Speaker A: You could actually integrate this with Nosy's wallet. Anybody else have any ideas they want to present? Nick, take it away. Yes. Hi, guys. I'm thinking about right now, you have projects like Crypto Voxels and Decentralized, which sell decentralized real estate, but if you want to invest in those, you need to buy an entire property. And I'm thinking about tokenizing the ownership of a property. And when you do so, you can set an expiration at when it will settle through auction.
00:34:51.294 - 00:35:29.326, Speaker A: So basically we tokenize a share in an NFT, which will get auctioned at a set date. So that way you split it up in pieces and then after a while it gets liquidated. So you will get X amount of eat depending on the result of the auction. Kind of like how with wrapped CryptoKitties, there's not really a good way to break up the basket. Yeah. But in wrapped CryptoKitties, you can put in any kitty and it will mean the same token, but here it will tokenize a share in the future proceeds of the auction. That was cool.
00:35:29.326 - 00:36:48.390, Speaker A: Then as an end goal, I would like to have maybe a balancer pool with a bunch of them in there so you can speculate on a piece of decentraland piece of crypto voxels, a kitty in there and maybe if all the so if it's going to go to auction at a certain date, but then the people that own the security, own the not securities, own the pieces of the pie or whatever, right? Own the pieces of the basket if they can hit snooze, maybe if they don't want to sell right now. So it becomes like a dow type thing if the majority of the owners decides to not liquidate for a while or something like that. Yeah. Like where the default case? The default case is you end up in auction. But then if it's like, hey, we still think this is like a good speculative value to hold it, then we all want to just keep it going rather than have to I am blanking on their name. What was the tokenizing gold? The OG tokenizing gold dow. That just liquidated, like a digix problem where it's like it defaults to lasting forever and then you have this huge coordination problem to make it not last forever.
00:36:48.390 - 00:37:19.134, Speaker A: Sort of the opposite, where it's like the coordination problem if we all still want to be in it. That's pretty nice. Cool. All right, Paul, now I got to find you and unmute you. Testing. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hey.
00:37:19.134 - 00:38:03.646, Speaker A: So we're working on a simple way to spin up multisig or a Dow, but for normies. So kind of in the same idea space as like Fantastic Twelve or signal Dow, but less chat bot forward of an interface and kind of like Dow House. But we wouldn't be using the word Dow. It's more like the Venmo or like Chase banking type audience, but like a casual group bank account. Yeah, like for PTAs and stuff. Yeah. You say PTA? Like Parent Teacher Association? Yeah, there's like a large transparency problem and then there's also a large bookkeeping problem that none of the parents really want to deal with and yeah, I don't know.
00:38:03.646 - 00:38:28.934, Speaker A: I've always loved Dows for that. Totally time that finally gets built. As long as people aren't scared of it. I don't know. How much money did you collect? Who's in charge of the bank account? All these things right now are just like yuck for these small like a cancer walk, like a community like a cancer walk. It's nasty. It's like a big coordination cost.
00:38:28.934 - 00:38:30.440, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah.
00:38:30.970 - 00:38:44.140, Speaker B: I'm actually curious. I really like this idea. I wonder what is the current challenge that the biggest roadblock you are solving right now in making this happen?
00:38:45.150 - 00:39:00.500, Speaker A: I suppose the proof is in the pudding that normies aren't using Dows. So I guess just like a different onboarding flow that sets them up with their own wallet in app rather than trying to get them on MetaMask, better Fiat, on ramp support, things like that. More abstraction in short.
00:39:03.270 - 00:39:03.874, Speaker B: Cool.
00:39:03.992 - 00:39:31.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I really like Dharma's flow for onboarding for Norman, if you've gone through that. Yeah, maybe. Cool, thanks. All right, looks like we've got harsh. I'm going to unmute you and you can tell us about your idea. Go ahead. Thanks.
00:39:31.320 - 00:40:34.522, Speaker A: Hey everyone. So my idea is more for a DeFi support tool. So I was thinking of building a push notification service of sort for the entire Ethereum. So it will basically be divided into app owners which can send messages to all the users or all the wallets which have subscribed to their groups. And basically once they send the messages, then the web3 providers can pick it up and display to them or they can use the app or the website to come and check out their message. That's sort of a basic idea, which I'm working on right now, but would like to know all of you guys, what do you guys think about that? I love this idea. I have a bunch of docs about how I would build it.
00:40:34.522 - 00:41:06.218, Speaker A: I not ever had time to build it. It's something people need. I don't know if you heard the very beginning, but not having ever built this idea, I would have actually, since then needed it, so not to have lost my own money. So yeah, I don't know if you do get serious about it. Definitely ping me. I think it's something people need. I'm right in the middle of the architect.
00:41:06.218 - 00:41:28.074, Speaker A: Hopefully I'm right about it. So yeah, fingers crossed. All right, cool. Yeah. Anybody else interested in sharing? It doesn't have to be fully worked out. You can just talk about some initial ideas. All right.
00:41:28.074 - 00:42:07.058, Speaker A: Cyril. Yeah, hi, go ahead. Okay. We would like to build a market for oil that simulates the futures of the financial futures of mainstream market. And we want to use Uma priceless synthetic token. And I wanted to ask if it is possible for the because Uma is like a die for the dollar. It's the same, but it has an expiration.
00:42:07.058 - 00:43:18.650, Speaker A: So something is put in the vault. No, ether is put in the vault. And tokens are created for a face value that is like 100% in relation to 120%. That is the collateral that has been put in the vault of the and I wanted to ask if there is any product that could help the sponsor of this token. Like, for example, I have only 30 ether and I want to issue die for 60 times the price of ether. So the double of what I have if there is a product that will lend me the money, like for example, 60 ether so that I have 19 total 150% of the face value. And to put this in collateral and if it falls under, well, 10% or 15%, it will liquidate the loan.
00:43:18.650 - 00:44:04.380, Speaker A: Give back, like instead of 60, 61 ether to the lender, 13% to the liquidator and the remaining to me that I did the operation, you don't really understand the project. Are you trying to build something on the insurance market with opium? No, I am trying to simulate the futures. Specifically the oil futures. Well, it's not a great future right now. It is a great future. It's a feature, not a bug. Exactly.
00:44:08.530 - 00:44:35.238, Speaker B: I thought about doing this, like on Uma. I think they're launching or something today. Yeah, you may check that out when Uma comes live. Yeah, I think that will be a really funny thing because I just saw FTX roll out oil, its oil future. And the settlement price is going to be $100 above the spot price. So to keep it positive. So I thought that's a funny thing.
00:44:35.238 - 00:44:36.706, Speaker B: That very tight.
00:44:36.738 - 00:45:01.520, Speaker A: Yeah. If you want to build that, I'm also interested. I was buying physical barrel of oil. So that's probably something we can do. Sorry, where'd you put them? Yeah. You're taking physical delivery? Yeah, it's in the countryside of France. Wow.
00:45:01.520 - 00:45:29.130, Speaker A: It's not barrel. It's in a massive cube. It's a massive 3000 liters. It doesn't come in like small milk caves on your property. It comes with a track. But I have a capacity of 10,000 liters right now. And it's probably something that with Uma, we could actually tokenize it and that's great.
00:45:29.130 - 00:46:02.100, Speaker A: I love it. That would be amazing to tokenize. Julian's delivered oil truck. Yeah. If you think about serial, if you're building this, I'm actually interested. I think there's something to yeah, can I send you a direct message in discord and we'll speak about it? Yeah, just message me on Twitter or something. But I think it's a cool it's a massive potential right now.
00:46:02.100 - 00:46:33.920, Speaker A: Also awesome. Also, in general, if anybody wants to DM me about your idea or whatever, just find me in the Fglobal discord and ping me. Yeah, same for me. All right. One of the things we've started doing is quick attention checks. So what I'm going to ask everybody to do, if you have your video on, pick up something smallish on your desk and just hold it up to the camera. That's not your phone.
00:46:33.920 - 00:46:57.910, Speaker A: And as per usual, my cat is making an appearance. We have a mask, a hat. I don't know what Mick is holding. A marker. Wait, I should start crypto. Kaiju, look at that. We should start keeping track of the strangest objects that people have.
00:46:57.910 - 00:47:06.390, Speaker A: Head scratcher plates. These are great plates.
00:47:06.730 - 00:47:26.270, Speaker B: Clearly you can tell who's at home and who's right, because I'm stuck in San Francisco. I'm unfortunately stuck in a place where I can't move or travel to any place in the world because of the travel COVID-19 travel band Eternally.
00:47:27.010 - 00:47:52.162, Speaker A: But someone is sitting on the boat. I can see, like, sailing or something, like fishing. Brandon, you sure that's not just their background? Oh, yeah, that's just a background. Cool. All right, we've got about ten minutes left, so let's try and get in a few more proposals. Looks like Daniel was next. Okay, cool.
00:47:52.162 - 00:48:33.380, Speaker A: Go ahead. Yeah, so I saw in the butyrin level ideas to do a Medium clone on IPFS. I thought that was a cool idea, but I wanted to give it a cool spin using Ave. So I'm thinking instead of like, with Medium, where you have to pay money every month to subscribe, I was thinking maybe we could take some die and stake it maybe like 50 something amount of die. And the interest from each reader would then get paid to go to the creators of the content. So just kind of like a lossless way of subscribing to good content. So that's kind of my idea.
00:48:33.380 - 00:49:00.300, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a great idea. It's kind of simple to build. Yeah, I don't know a lot about smart. I mean, I know about smart contracts, not really how to write. I'm learning solidity, but I think it shouldn't be too difficult to make. The only kind of question is how to incentivize good content. But I'm kind of thinking through that right now.
00:49:00.300 - 00:50:00.974, Speaker A: Probably at the beginning would just invite writers that are good writers to come on and hopefully they'll make good content. But I'm sure there could be made more complex later with better incentives. I don't know people steemit and Sent, you can pay money to your favorite author, but I'm thinking it'd be kind of like a UBI for the authors. Everyone who's an author would receive money based on how many articles they've written. So it'd basically be like a UBI that be paid out to everyone, all the writers at the same time, like every day or every week or whatever, based on how much dai has been staked. But how do you I mean, having good or bad content is kind of like subjective. How would you rate? I would definitely spam, obviously.
00:50:00.974 - 00:50:47.280, Speaker A: Just posting every day or posting a lot with no real content. That would be just classified as spam and probably just be deleted. Yeah, that's a good point. I've seen this guy building a project for emails. So you basically send your personal token for example, you send your personal token to Vitalik and then Vitalik is requested to read the email, but he's actually receiving his own tokens. But if he doesn't actually open the email and read it, then you basically lose value of his own token. So maybe there's a concept that you can apply in your medium idea.
00:50:47.280 - 00:51:33.580, Speaker A: Maybe it can be a mix between personal tokens and a TCR mechanism, a token carried to the registry. I'm not sure, but I think the email spamming mechanism was very good. Yeah. And someone says, yeah, it's like I am going to have the writer stake die as well. But then if you stake die against so what is the punishment like, what do you do if you stake the die? You lose the die. If the content is not good, that would definitely be a good mechanism to have them. Like every article, they could stake some die or something and then if it is classified as spam, then they would lose their dye or something.
00:51:33.580 - 00:51:50.786, Speaker A: Cool. Let's try and get into a few other ones. Andrew, thanks. Hello? Can you hear me? Yes. Excellent. Yeah. So first of all, Daniel, I think that's a great idea.
00:51:50.786 - 00:52:38.414, Speaker A: The thing I want to discuss was also relating to no Loss, very much inspired by Pull Together. It was actually an idea from Stanny of Aid was talking about it under the thread. Basically, it's no loss betting. So instead of the interest on people's dai being randomly allocated, it is allocated to people based on a position they take. For a very quick example, imagine it's a US presidential election. You can either stake Dai on Trump or Biden and all of the interests will go into a pool. You can't withdraw your stake for the duration of whatever the event is and then at the end it uses an oracle to find out who won the election and then all of the interest is shared among everyone that states the correct outcome.
00:52:38.414 - 00:52:59.942, Speaker A: So basically it's no loss betting, which is essentially it's a prediction market or it's a way of gamifying savings, depending on how you look at it. Depending on how it's marketed, I guess. But that's the idea. It's a great idea. I love it. It's a pull together for prediction market. Yeah, exactly.
00:52:59.942 - 00:53:55.754, Speaker A: It's basically a fun way of saving money, which is essentially what pull together is. It's just a slight yeah. But I think, economically speaking, I think there's a problem, because then, basically, you can bet on anything because you know that you're not going to lose any money because you can participate in all the different bids, you can participate in everything, but your payout is proportional to how much you stake from an outcome. So if you choose the wrong one, you'll get less money, you'll win less money. But is in bidding system, you want to bid because you know you can lose money. But in a system where you can not lose money, can you actually bid? Well, you are tying up your die for the duration of the competition, so you do have an opportunity cost. It's just like put together.
00:53:55.754 - 00:54:25.970, Speaker A: I think you can make it mutual. Say that again. Like horse betting. It's like the ODS are like whatever money people put in rather than a prediction market where it's like there's a bid in an offer. Oh, yeah, absolutely. And the odds would be implied based on how much people are staking on each of the outcomes and so basically be chosen by the market and there wouldn't need be any kind of bid and offer. The UX would actually be quite simple.
00:54:25.970 - 00:54:59.360, Speaker A: It would simply be choose a candidate of the US election to use that as an example. It's just an example. And then it's simply, I want to stake 100 die that biden's going to win. Currently the thing is saying there's a 40% chance of him winning and that's it. And then at the end of the competition, you get your money back and maybe you get somebody interest as well. I think the UX is easier than existing prediction markets as well. Yeah, you could take put together contracts and then add it to nosis or Ogre prediction market.
00:54:59.360 - 00:55:30.362, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm already quite familiar with the Oracles. Or you could make it a lossful and just make it a paramutual betting market where you just avoid the one risk of the interest rates. Right. DeFi interest rates could be really high and then it's awesome. Or they could be very low and then it's harder to get the excitement. I mean, I think a paramutual betting framework might be something useful too. That's a good idea.
00:55:30.362 - 00:56:04.254, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Awesome. Keep getting in touch if anyone wants to help me build this. Tito, go ahead. Yeah, thanks. So basically my idea is more related to trading and DeFi again, so it's not about nodules lotteries or whatever and it is about market making. Basically most of the market making models right now are related to put liquidity and this is the way that we are doing it with smart contracts.
00:56:04.254 - 00:57:13.578, Speaker A: But if we have a liquidity which is provided on demand with some market making bot or whatever, you can have like two streams of interest. You can, for example, provide some die on demand and where there is demand for swapping, for example ETH for Dai or BTC for Dai, you can provide it but during the other time when it's not in usage, you can stake it in compound and all these things could be optimized and you can stake for most of the time. But when there is an order which you can match, you can just provide the liquidity and take like 0.5% let's say, which is the spread from the market price and it is much more profitable than just staking in some lending protocol, whatever. So you can combine them with this more different approach of liquidity provision. You can at the same time provide liquidity on demand and when it's not used you can lend in Ave or compound or something like that. That's the idea that I have.
00:57:13.578 - 00:58:28.818, Speaker A: Do you think that it could work? So you want to build a pool that shakes the best yield for making market maker? Yeah, it is like a software which everyone just download start on his computer and when there is a good trade which you are matching, then you provide the liquidity and if there is not you're just lending in compound or other. Yeah, because I actually been working on that in Arbitrage Dow. The first problem is the one that if you reach so you need like a limit size of the pool because otherwise the profit are too low to be shared across all the people that are putting liquidity. So it can only be for except if you're good at chasing all the profit, all the spreads on the market. But otherwise it's very difficult to get a better yield than compound or whatsoever. Because when the liquidity is low then it's great, but then when it's too high there's no incentive for people to keep their liquidity inside the pool. That's the first thing.
00:58:28.818 - 00:59:32.902, Speaker A: And then secondly when you have access to flash loan and if flash loan they don't charge a fee, then it's really difficult to compete against them. How is that related to the flash loan? I mean it is just for swapping, like uniswap or let's say our protocol in particular is for cross chain swaps so it is for BTC, die or whatever. But I mean flush walls, how are they related to that? Okay, so it's only for market maker, you don't want like Arbitrage or whatsoever? Yeah, it is only for market makers which can provide liquidity or just land at the same time. Okay, we are right at eleven unfortunately. I wish we could keep talking about this. Scott, Julie and Tina, do you guys have a few more minutes or do you have to run? What does it look like on your end? I'm good, I'm good. It's sunny on my side.
00:59:32.902 - 00:59:53.630, Speaker A: I'm good. All right, well it's snowing where I am so stop bragging. Oh, wow. Where are you? I'm in the east coast. East coast, us. It's not pleasant. So, yeah, let's go for a few more minutes, try and get in a few more ideas.
00:59:53.630 - 01:00:41.206, Speaker A: If anybody has to leave really quick before anybody goes, I just want to remind you, if you have applied to Hack Money, you have to stake. Staking is the next step. It's something that's going to be returned to you at the end of the hackathon, but you should have received an email if you've been accepted. So check your spam, check your emails, make sure that you're staking and you're logging in to set up your team. Read the logistics packet. We've got a bunch of information that we've sent out, so we want to start getting people into the proper mode. And check on Discord if you haven't joined, if your name is not red, that means you're not properly registered.
01:00:41.206 - 01:01:08.754, Speaker A: If you're red, that's good. That means you're in the Hack Money section. So make sure to stake, start checking out the sponsor prizes and check your spam email in case you haven't heard any of this before. All right, let's try and get in a few more. Jordan, looks like you're next. Oh, hey, cool. The stream kind of went janky there.
01:01:08.754 - 01:02:08.050, Speaker A: You mentioned something about my name not being read on the Discord. Just DM me later and we can work on that. But go ahead, tell us about your idea. Cool to jump on the Pool together kind of bandwagon. My idea is kind of like a patreon kind of thing for content creators and it's kind of come out of the whole problems with YouTube kicking crypto YouTubers off and stuff like that. And we want to kind of use this discovery platform in order to bring people into the crypto space, but they're kicking us off, so we need to find our own platforms and we need to find a way to monetize those platforms. So the idea is if crypto, YouTubers or anybody really wants to create their own platform, they can add on this piece that allows people to donate die.
01:02:08.050 - 01:03:27.168, Speaker A: And instead of it going directly to them, it locks it up in a pool together kind of way where the interest is what the content creator is going to be paid out. And this will also feed into the discovery kind of thing where we can use the metrics of how much die is actually locked up for a particular content producer to kind of weight how much this person's content is valuable. And then we can have that kind of be the discovery platform. So it's a play on pool together where the outcome doesn't go to one of the pool participants, the outcome goes to a content creator. And this could also be like for charities or for any other kind of crowdfunding platform. But the first kind of avenue was the YouTube kind of dilemma content creator kind of dilemma there. Yeah, I could definitely see kind of the motivations to just transfer your money to stake with someone and you're going to get it back.
01:03:27.168 - 01:04:31.636, Speaker A: Definitely appeal to someone that may be just giving your money to someone you're a fan of. It seems like some people might want to give their money away, but other people might feel more comfortable just giving the interest away. So maybe it broadens the appeal of who wants to financially participate with their favorite influencers. That part is pretty interesting. It also seems like it lends itself very well to being like a harder to manipulate kind of like not self show but sort of total value locked is like how much skin in the game are people really putting in. It's also sort of like this skin in the game issue and maybe even a little better than if you made a metric about how much money is someone collecting on the platform because they could just give themselves, they could just create wash donations, like essentially give themselves money and rise up the leaderboard. But if they actually have to stake money, that's like a harder ask.
01:04:31.636 - 01:05:07.200, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. That's really interesting. It seems like I no idea whether it seems like legitimately new enough. It's hard to guess what the real appeal is, but you'll never know until you ask people if they want to do it. Awesome. Tom, let me unmute you and then you're up. Also one thing I realized I didn't explain is how to actually raise your hand in zoom.
01:05:07.200 - 01:05:47.180, Speaker A: I only noticed it after Tom kept going like this. But there's a little button in the interface where it puts up a little blue hand next to your name. But I'll make sure to explain that for next time. Go ahead, Tom. Yes, sorry, I didn't see so can you hear me okay? Yes. Cool. So my idea was sort of thinking around okay, so recently was like Thursday we've had issues with dipec and at the time where most people want it to deleverage, there just isn't enough liquidity.
01:05:47.180 - 01:07:37.600, Speaker A: But there's a lot of liquidity on centralized stable coins. So that sort of led to USDC being integrated as a collateral type, which was controversial to say at least. What I've been sort of thinking about is whether we can kind of make that optional, no pun intended, punk signing later. Essentially, we can incentivize users who are okay with centralized stablecoins to basically pull their dai that they're holding and kind of give out options to allow people to buy that underlying die in return for a small premium in. A centralized civil coin to kind of try and limit this kind of how far above the Peggy actually rise without actually having any centralized civil coins backing Dai itself? So the way it would work is if you hold dai and you're going to put into the DSR but you're equally happily to just receive some centralized stablecoin you can put into contracts. It kind of sits in the DSR and then should you can kind of create options to allow people to buy out this die at possibly like 1.5 USDC to one die.
01:07:37.600 - 01:09:37.268, Speaker A: So it kind of gives a better revenue stream for Dai holders that are centralized stable coins. But if you are kind of a decentralization maximalist, you can kind of ignore it completely, you don't have to worry about it and you're safe with as you were before. You can benefit from some of the stability without having to worry about any kind of risks of centralized coins being frozen. And then at that point I kind of saw the buterian novel idea from kind of stanny at that point when we're talking about kind of options for different stablecoins. I think it might be interesting to get into just making for non USD stablecoins having wrapping up kind of options into the case where you can say you have a euro stable coin, you can buy die. But to put into compound or whatever, but at the same time that you buy it, you automatically get an option to allow you to like some fraction of your original euro value. So allow people to integrate well to participate in DeFi which is normally US dollar denominated while still minimizing their risk in their own currency.
01:09:37.268 - 01:11:27.340, Speaker A: Tom was this two separate ideas? It's pretty linked most of the inspector behind us. So it's just a choice of we can have there is a benefit to having these options between US dollar stable coins and then there's benefits of branching out into different currencies as well. Okay, seems like a pretty big idea. Yeah, I feel that. Yeah, but it kind of breaks down quite nicely because I feel like the Dai options, if we discount the other currencies thing, that's still a self contained project and it still brings value, I think. Any thoughts from our I think the first half of the idea sounds a bit like something that could maybe be built on something like balancer. If you put all your decentralized stable coins into a balancer pool and then you tokenize that and then that kind of hypothesized stablecoin was then used as a collateral for maker instead of USDC, it would kind of solve that first problem where you don't actually have the stablecoin directly in maker.
01:11:27.340 - 01:12:37.400, Speaker A: Sorry. Think about if we have a uniswap v two pool where I have USDC and Gemini dollars or whatever. GUSD right. And then I have pool tokens which probably as long as both of those are worth a dollar, the pool tokens also have a stable dollar. And then would those pool tokens then be kind of just a two stable coin version of the first half of the idea or did I misunderstand? The way I'm kind of coming at it is I don't really want to have this pool open to kind of people to buy out your coins at any time. It would only be in situations where Dai is deviating from this peg. So situation like that, the Dai providers would have to have a fair amount of their deposits also in a centralized stable coin.
01:12:37.400 - 01:13:24.684, Speaker A: It feels like you're saying I haven't looked at balancer, but if I'm in uniswap, if I'm providing liquidity to this, I have to also have exposure to the centralized stablecoin, which I may not want to have all the time. I may not understand it. Yeah, I think Tom, if you haven't written this out yet, I think I'm getting what you're trying to describe, but definitely would help if it's been written out. So if you want to throw that into the hack ideas channel, I think that would be super helpful for everybody. Sure. Awesome. There are three left, three hands raised.
01:13:24.684 - 01:14:11.762, Speaker A: So let's do those three and then I think we can wrap up. All right, go ahead. Hello everybody. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, so I'm working on an application that will help any valuable asset owner to tokenize their asset and use it as collateral for a loan. So that's the idea for now. Can you repeat? You're tokenizing physical assets? Yeah, real world assets.
01:14:11.762 - 01:15:19.322, Speaker A: So we are different of rocket NFT. I see someone write rocket NFT. But how do you legally tokenize assets? Yeah, legally we will work with institution with some institution or some business if it's for a car or real estate. So we'll be working with a business or with institution that will have to validate our yes. I think this kind of project, the issue is just the legal implementation because technically speaking, it's pretty easy to have an NFT that represents a physical asset. But legally I think it's where you've got most of the work to be done. Yes.
01:15:19.322 - 01:15:44.980, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I mean, if you can solve the problem, it's a really valuable problem to solve. But yeah, I think I sort of agree with Julian. The tech problem is one part is not super easy. Yeah. But the legal part is probably ten x harder than the tech part, at least.
01:15:44.980 - 01:15:52.040, Speaker A: I don't think this is like, for hackathon, it's probably a little bit too.
01:15:54.890 - 01:17:05.338, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like for hackathons, I really like those crypto native ideas because it's feasible and also kind of just kind of putting two or three different mechanisms or protocols together. Those sometimes can create very interesting combinations that actually can be of use, I think instead of like a really big real world idea, which requires a lot of legal reports, enforcement and hard to scale. And I think that's something that is probably more suitable for a hackathon I would consider. But also I think East Global has come to the point that I feel like all real world ideas have been tried and tested and thrown out there for the past two years. That we're at this point where it's a bit more kind of niche, a lot of times we seem to pick on very niche ideas. That doesn't sound revolutionary, but it's like an optimization.
01:17:05.338 - 01:17:14.270, Speaker B: But I think those are the projects that will provide value to the rest of the folks in this industry.
01:17:15.730 - 01:18:21.160, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Go ahead, Ben. Ben, it seems like you're unmuted but we can't hear you might be permissions issue or your headphones or something about now. There you go. My idea was it's a bit raw, so I came up with it just before this. Right now we have collateralized loans, but we don't have uncollateralized loans, which in the real world are based on like a credit score generally. So I think I've seen a few projects working on this.
01:18:21.160 - 01:19:39.680, Speaker A: So this idea might already be being worked on by somebody else, I don't know. So maybe someone could tell me that. But my idea is you use an NFT to represent a person and then basically so that could represent a loan for instance, and then on a secondary market that NFT would then trade and then that would create the rate for your loan basically. So even kind of prior to actually applying for a loan, there would be this NFT traded which would be like other traders willingness to then lend to you and basically so you might say how is the credit score going to be formed? Well, it would be formed by just kind of like the real world rough consensus. Like I would say, oh, this is my NFT, I'd give the address, I'd publish it on Twitter, et cetera. And then people would trade and I would publish details about whatever I wanted, like my income for instance, or my job or basically some indication of my ability to pay it. Yeah, that's basically the idea.
01:19:39.680 - 01:21:14.260, Speaker A: So you put your income on Twitter to get the put whatever you could put in the public, whatever you like, then how do you verify that is, how do you verify this information? Well, you can verify it in any way you like. So one person for instance, if they wanted to guarantee their loan, they could publish everything and have it notarized put. That all online for everyone to see, basically. I'm not sure where you're from, but the US had a system like this before the financial crisis, like no doc loans or they're called liar loans. And essentially you could go to the bank and get a loan on real estate without really providing any proof of your ability to pay. And a lot of people took out these loans and their repayment rates weren't that great. It turns out there's a population of people that if you can make up stuff to get a loan, they will.
01:21:14.260 - 01:22:08.740, Speaker A: Criminals or people that do that as their job kind of isn't what union protocol was trying to build on corruptionized or unsecured loan. Yeah, that's right. I saw them and they're trying to build that, but I didn't see it based on individual NFTs that are traded. I think it's more like credit union. I think they use a Dow mechanism to then set the rates for the different loans and decision making. So this wouldn't be a Dow mechanism, this would be purely you have this NFT. And then just the meaning of the project implies that this NFT represents somebody.
01:22:08.740 - 01:23:04.690, Speaker A: I think the barrier that you have to solve, and I'm not saying you can't solve it, is that you have to disincentivize people coming to rip you off and taking out loans without any plan to repay. Yeah. So the disincentive for that is the same as the regular credit score, is that you would then get no credit in the future from this system. But it's kind of like yeah, it's debatable as how it would affect your real world, whether people trust you in the real world. That's really debatable. But if this system continued on, then you would no longer be able to get any credit from that. Such a system, the current system, you also get annoying people calling your phone every hour of the day.
01:23:04.690 - 01:23:44.080, Speaker A: And then if you do ever make enough money, if you owe enough and you make enough money, you'll get taken to court and potentially get your wages garnished. So that doesn't apply to a lot of people that owe money. Like if you don't pay your cable bill, you're not going to get your wages. Yeah. And also if you lie about your things to get credit, that can be fraud and you could have other larger penalties. Yeah. So your point is that there's bigger incentives in the real world and therefore is a problem translating these onto this project.
01:23:44.080 - 01:24:33.698, Speaker A: Yeah, because it's like a civil resistance problem because maybe I care about not getting credit in the future, but this imaginary person I made up to try to get a loan from you, they definitely don't care about their future credit. And so how you do that is the problem, or part of the problem at least. I remember there was another project called Zero Collateral or something like that. Then it's a cascade of loans that are getting paid using the interest repayment of the previous loan. There was something like that. It's called zero collateral. Yeah, I think they're definitely focused on that kind of piece.
01:24:33.698 - 01:25:14.574, Speaker A: You hinted at Ben in that really trying to get that score into your social reputation amongst your friends is like an important mechanism. Or you could tokenize something that is very precious to you. For example, you could tokenize your Twitter access. Let's say it's an NFT token. If you cannot repay the loan, then you lose your Twitter access for a period of time until you repay the loan. Then you can retrieve the access to that Twitter. I like the idea of pledging your phone number and so if you don't pay back, you get a message to anyone that calls you just saying.
01:25:14.574 - 01:25:34.100, Speaker A: This number is not operational because Jonathan hasn't paid back his loans or can't manage to pay back his loans or you do something like they do in China, you cannot take the public transportation anymore. I think we should take away your truck of.
01:25:38.230 - 01:27:13.054, Speaker B: I think like I like the idea of once again, not enforceable real world recourse but to have something really aesthetic. That's why I do think that going a bit further. I think the floating like the NFT tokenizing, the credit part is easy but I do think the hard part is really to bootstrap the reputation system without an identity on chain identity. I would prefer in this case to go towards an optimized version of what union was doing. So Union essentially having your friends stake for you with skin in the game, with crypto, whereas however, it's hard to get that many friends up front. So there are actually entities in third world countries or in other places where they know the local people and so they're kind of like the local rural bank who knows everyone or like the neighborhood community leaders and who already are doing this kind of reputation staking verification for people. So it's still kind of fully on chain like incentivization but it's more kind of like a minor improvement on the existing the Dow membership staking, like your friend staking but kind of more catered towards an entity.
01:27:13.054 - 01:27:55.650, Speaker B: Like making it super easy to bootstrap the credit system upfront. So to make it easier for people who already have capital and already have a reputation network but not necessarily have to be the credit score companies or that that's kind of like the approach that I like kind of purely based on economic incentives but optimizing for the actual situations. So it's kind of like an oligarchical credit issuance market structure.
01:27:57.670 - 01:28:32.874, Speaker A: Cool. All right, I hate to cut anybody off but we're going to just do one more person and then I'd encourage anybody who wants to keep talking to jump into the discord voice chat. We've got a couple of channels there. I think the one in Hack money is called Cafe. So again, I'll jump over there if anybody else wants to. I'm happy to keep talking. Tina, really quick, one thing that you mentioned earlier was you feel like all the ideas that can be done have been done and so people will try to find the small niche ideas that haven't been touched on.
01:28:32.874 - 01:29:40.526, Speaker A: And it just got me thinking that one of the things that we're trying to do with Hack Money is now that we have 30 days, that's like an infinite amount of time compared to the weekend hackathon. So there's a lot more time to iterate and find something that's a little more featureful and I think that's a really exciting opportunity for anybody who's participating to sort of sorry on that point. I wouldn't want anyone to get discouraged because things have been tried, but just because something was tried during 2017. The tooling, the total addressable market, the reasons people were in the space were completely different. And there are just so many factors. There wasn't a community of DFI enthusiasts in 2017, there was like a ravaged community of ICO Punters in 2017 that weren't really trying to join liquidity pools or interact with stuff. And so you never quite know what blockers caused some of these ideas.
01:29:40.526 - 01:30:37.874, Speaker A: It seemed good not to work, but if you can have another take on them with how much I mean, theorem is still immature, but it's way less immature. And with a lot of the things that have happened in the last three years, if you can remix them with the capabilities we have now. Just aragon, right? In 2017 it was like, yeah, let's do this. And basically for the first twelve months of Aragon, there was nothing on Aragon. And now you're starting to see projects actually use it because the environment around Ethereum has changed and there's just more stuff you can do because the space is bigger from a builder and user community group, even though it's smaller from a market cap perspective. But that's not super important for building something that people will want to use. Yeah, that's a good way to frame it.
01:30:37.874 - 01:31:16.420, Speaker A: Even if it's been tried before, there might be a new twist that you can put on an existing idea. And the cool thing is, with all these past ETH global events, you can look at what people have already done, see what they did and maybe change their approach, know, remix it. It's a good backlog or good archive to look through. All right, really quick, Jordy, why don't you tell us your idea? You are muted. It might be oh, OK, go ahead. Sorry. Yep, good.
01:31:16.420 - 01:32:10.830, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Really quickly, two ideas following from comments from Tina, one of them more crypto native and super simple. I think within the scope of the hackathon, you may have seen the emergence of option contracts in DeFi with the likes of Open or Hedging. I think it would be pretty cool if you could implement a dynamic Hedging position so that you saved ETH, for example, and these ETH were dynamically hedged by put contracts in a way that you could basically implement this strategy hands off so that it was like a robotraded Hedging position. I hope that makes sense. That's the simple idea. And it's very crypto native and I think somebody will end up doing it because today if you want to hedge, it's quite complicated.
01:32:10.830 - 01:33:03.742, Speaker A: You have to keep an eye on the pricing contract, the pricing, you have to stay on top of it. I think this could be super easily automated by a kind of a trustless role advisor. In fact, I've been running some back tests on it, happy to circulate the results with other people. And then the other idea is a lot more ambitious and it falls on the realm of real world. And really what we're trying to do is orchestrate two communities. Okay? On the one hand, you have potentially elderly people who are homeowners and are low on liquidity. So maybe I'm 70 years old and the pension in my country is getting smaller and smaller and it turns out I'm actually a homeowner.
01:33:03.742 - 01:34:21.864, Speaker A: Okay? So the idea is that I transfer this home equity into a pool and then I get currency in exchange without having to vacate my home. Okay, who's providing this liquidity? This is on the other side. And then on the other side you have basically regular savers who also don't trust the pension scheme in their countries. And what they're doing is they're contributing liquidity today into a pool and then in return they get this special type of home equity that as soon as the person passes away on the other side creates cash flows that return back to the liquidity provider. And so what you have is like a circular economy that's linking people that have liquidity in the present time and are looking for real estate equity and on the other hand, people that do have real estate equity and need liquidity. And so what we're thinking of is making a system emerge that orchestrates both markets. Any thoughts? Well, I like the first idea.
01:34:21.864 - 01:34:40.688, Speaker A: I really like it. I think it makes a lot of sense, especially with what I'm working on. I think it's cool. Like it? Yeah. It seems like there were also some comments in the chat as well. Some people like that idea. So definitely put that into the hack ideas channel if you haven't already.
01:34:40.688 - 01:35:06.650, Speaker A: Sure. Awesome. Well, this has been really good. I appreciate everybody who showed up. Thank you again to our speakers, brainstorm Helpers, Scott, Jillian, Tina, you guys have been awesome. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and respond hopefully. I'm sure it's going to really help hackers as they start to flesh out their ideas and get their teams together.
01:35:06.650 - 01:35:23.884, Speaker A: Again, if you haven't staked for hack money, please do so. If you're having technical issues, reach out. We want to make sure everybody is ready to go when the bell rings on Friday. There's not going to be an actual bell, but maybe we should have a bell. Yeah. So they kick off. Be sure to register for that.
01:35:23.884 - 01:35:43.664, Speaker A: It's going to be awesome. It's linda G from Scalar Capital. Spencer Noon from Doggy Tail Crypto Capital. I think it's the name. And Austin Griffith from the Ethereum Foundation. They're going to be talking about DeFi. Just have a general discussion on it and it's going to be really great.
01:35:43.664 - 01:36:00.552, Speaker A: I'm looking forward to it. So again, thank you everybody for showing up. Stake if you haven't, register for the kickoff. And yeah, let's keep the discussion session going into the discord if you haven't already. All right. Awesome organizing it. Yeah, no problem.
01:36:00.552 - 01:36:05.880, Speaker A: Glad you guys could all make it. All right? Yeah. Thanks, Trent, for doing it's. Awesome. Have a good rest of the day.
01:36:06.030 - 01:36:06.500, Speaker B: Bye.
01:36:06.580 - 01:36:07.636, Speaker A: See you guys. Bye.
