00:00:00.570 - 00:00:20.750, Speaker A: So next up, can I call Peter, Dan, John and Sean to the stage as well as Kartik? So I'm going to turn it over to Kartik Talwar, who is the co founder of Global, as well as the general partner at a capital in San Francisco.
00:00:22.620 - 00:00:23.800, Speaker B: Thanks, Navil.
00:00:24.140 - 00:00:26.944, Speaker C: So this is an excellent presentation as.
00:00:26.982 - 00:00:32.204, Speaker D: A general overview of Web Three. And I'll be doing a quick panel.
00:00:32.252 - 00:00:34.128, Speaker C: With all of us, just kind of.
00:00:34.134 - 00:00:54.070, Speaker D: Covering some of the questions around what it means to transition to that world. I know we already kind of heard from Peter and what Horizon Games is doing, so maybe starting with Dan, we'd love to learn or have the audience know who you are, what you do, and just in general what Three means to you.
00:00:54.760 - 00:01:35.350, Speaker C: Sure. So my name is Dan Litzer. I'm an investor at IDEO Colab Ventures, which is a crypto blockchain focused early stage VC fund from IDEO, which is this global design firm. So we tend to come at this from a very user centric perspective. And one of the big questions around Web Three has been around usability. And I think that some of the folks on stage have really been leading the way in terms of making these financial interactions online in these kind of mini economies that are being created, making them feel a lot more Web Two. Like.
00:01:35.350 - 00:01:47.480, Speaker C: So I spend a lot of time looking around, playing it. I love SkyWeaver, played it a bunch and yeah, just really excited by how quickly this space is evolving.
00:01:51.470 - 00:02:27.160, Speaker D: Well, I'm the CEO of Fortmatic and basically we solved the usability problems in Web Three by solving key management problems. So you can log into a Web Three app like normal with email or phone in a noncustodial key management architecture and yeah, basically alternative to MetaMask so users don't have to kind of drop off during Onboarding. Before that I was proud of Lead at Docker created Docker Desktop, which is used by millions of developers every month.
00:02:29.530 - 00:03:14.850, Speaker B: And I'm Samson, I'm with Brave Software. Glad that we got that little plug at the beginning. Thank you so much. Of course, Brave is a privacy oriented browser. We focus not on just preserving user privacy, user sovereignty, but also on the sustainability of the Web we've seen since 2016 forward, more than 600 million devices are blocking asset trackers across the Web. This is spectacular for making a safer, more private web as those trackers tend to leak your information liberally to various third parties without your consent. But there's also a sustainability issue there because when you're blocking all of these ads, you're not just hurting big companies, you're hurting the small people, as I mentioned, the people who are writing tutorials on Solidity, the people who are building awesome new games if they were to run advertisements in those games.
00:03:14.850 - 00:03:31.786, Speaker B: And so what Brave has done is we've actually set out to create a utility token that would allow you to transfer value back into this individual's wallets. And it's been working considerably well for us for a few years now. So looking forward to where this industry goes forward and what we talk about today.
00:03:31.968 - 00:03:37.834, Speaker D: Thanks. So a lot of interesting things are just touched upon. What I want to kind of say.
00:03:37.872 - 00:03:40.094, Speaker C: Is let's start a discussion on this.
00:03:40.132 - 00:03:47.102, Speaker D: One topic about data. An interesting sort of consequence mindset moving to the Web Three world is that.
00:03:47.156 - 00:03:48.734, Speaker C: Now you are moving the cost of.
00:03:48.772 - 00:04:11.110, Speaker D: Managing the data and the ownership of it to the user. There's a lot of side effects of that. There's a lot of the good and bad of it. From kind of your perspective, just maybe starting with do you think that's a good move or should users be in charge of their own data and do they want that? What do you think about that from the point of view of your product.
00:04:11.260 - 00:04:12.358, Speaker C: The point of view of what the.
00:04:12.364 - 00:04:17.260, Speaker D: General sentiment is, and should the average users care?
00:04:18.430 - 00:04:58.214, Speaker C: I'm happy to give a first pass. I don't think any user cares about managing their own data. In fact, they don't want to manage their own data. What they want is privacy and the ability to control how that data is used. And so I think tools like Brave are really good for that, for putting the user back in control. But one of the, I think, big questions that everyone here has grappled with is how do you give users control without putting them in a position where they're going to screw up and lose their data? Nobody wants to lose their data even more than they don't want somebody else.
00:04:58.252 - 00:05:38.530, Speaker B: To misuse their data. Yeah, I'll piggyback off of that. I was not with you at the beginning, but then I was. I do think it's important that we as the individuals building the software, building the solutions that we face, the scary bits of it, users should not have to think about the blockchain, they should not have to think about breaches and that type of stuff. They download our apps, they use our apps. They do so with an implicit trust that we are going to be doing things the proper way. The great thing about Brave and many other modern applications today is that we never have your data, never leaves your device, and we can't abuse or lose what we don't have.
00:05:38.530 - 00:05:49.330, Speaker B: And so I think it's to your point, the goal is to make it easy for the user so that this stuff just happens by default and the users don't have the concerns that they would have had in years prior.
00:05:50.630 - 00:06:43.430, Speaker D: Yeah, the way I see it is, I think in order to move users to the Webster world, it needs to be a more pragmatic path where we provide something that is a familiar user experience to users of the Web Two world. So I think by solving some of the key management challenges for example, leverage with things like IPFS to store user data, then you can kind of achieve this kind of experience without introducing new concepts to regular users. And yeah, essentially I think it's a progressive disclosure and as users get more context of what they want, they can slowly evolve into products that fulfill their requirements.
00:06:44.590 - 00:07:56.720, Speaker C: So actually one thing to circle back to your original question, who pays for this? I think that's a big challenge. One of the amazing things about the advertising driven model of Web as we know it today has been that it's enabled access to services to billions of people in the world, people who would not be able to pay if Facebook started charging they could not pay for Google services. And so there is this flattening effect from advertising that I think is really powerful and has enabled wonderful things in the world. I think the issue is that we've almost tipped too far and now we're in a place where the level of surveillance and loss of control of our data is a problem. But I think one of the things that I really don't want us to lose as we make this web3 transition is the idea that services need to find a way to remain free and accessible to everyone in the world, or else we've all entered in here idealistically. But we're going to end up creating a worse version of what we have today.
00:07:57.890 - 00:07:59.482, Speaker D: That's a very interesting topic.
00:07:59.626 - 00:08:01.950, Speaker C: Maybe one comment from Peter.
00:08:02.110 - 00:08:15.586, Speaker D: As you kind of design a game that's mostly powered on Web Three, what kind of psychological behavior changes does that require? Do you think that it adds more complications or different mindset now that everybody can value this thing?
00:08:15.608 - 00:08:17.154, Speaker C: Or does that get abstracted away while.
00:08:17.192 - 00:08:22.178, Speaker D: We'Re doing these offering these features as things like you don't have to worry.
00:08:22.194 - 00:08:23.366, Speaker C: About data loss or you have to.
00:08:23.388 - 00:08:28.380, Speaker D: Worry about leakage or your information being stolen, but nothing else changes on the outside?
00:08:28.990 - 00:09:12.150, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a great question. That's what gaming is a cool thing to explore. Just because there's an existing market around virtual items, they can be typically low value, so it's easier to kind of explore the design space in terms of obviously usability and kind of data access. It should be essentially indistinguishable from what is Web Two. Obviously that's why we've taken the perspective of offering a fully integrated solution in terms of data and ownership. Of course, it's very important to take a noncustodial decentralized approach for multiple reasons. Even as an application developer or someone offering service, you don't want to take on the risk of actually losing someone's core assets.
00:09:12.150 - 00:09:41.106, Speaker E: Data is a big word. So there's so many kinds of data and people value data differently, I think. So if it's your assets which actually are related to a market that's a bit different in terms of gaming and why I think it's really cool, what's the incentive? There's kind of multiple reasons typically there's already virtual people like virtual items because they like the utility to be able.
00:09:41.128 - 00:09:42.274, Speaker C: To play with them.
00:09:42.472 - 00:10:47.430, Speaker E: There is actually a $32 billion market of virtual items for free video games. People buy them because they want to play with them, they want to show them off, and they like just the pleasure of collecting them. And I think what's really cool about adding the kind of the blockchain layer is there is a speculative kind of excitement around knowing that this could be converted to something else, perhaps, and I could refund it. Like in the digital download era, if I download something on my PS Four kind of better off going to EB games, at least I could swap it for another game. I think it's cool when you explore the defined space of competitive games because you can actually distribute rewards in kind of a profit sharing kind of a model. That what both net expands the number of people who are participating in this and ODS extra medigap capabilities. And I think even way cooler than that is people like the cycle of people creating and then contributing the players, contributing content or the developers to the players and creating this very interesting virtuous cycle.
00:10:47.430 - 00:10:57.640, Speaker E: And hopefully that answers your question to some extent, but it should be indistinguishable and secure and that's really hard to do for many.
00:10:59.630 - 00:11:22.766, Speaker D: Dan touched on that. And maybe I'll ask that seems in as well. But does moving to this Web Three let us kind of explore different types of business models. And as you kind of pointed out, a lot of this is based on subsidy that lets you kind of trade off distribution versus sort of revenue or product focus. How do you think about what changes in terms of business models or niches.
00:11:22.798 - 00:12:03.774, Speaker C: Or just how people operate businesses? Yeah, that's a great question. So what we've seen in this world today, the crypto world, the Web Three world, has been there have been two business models that have worked so far. One is exchanges where people are buying and selling tokens. The exchanges made a lot of money, and the other has been selling a token, issuing tokens. And those are not great generalizable models. Right. It's wonderful that there are some big businesses built that way, some big infrastructure built that way, but we do need to get beyond that.
00:12:03.774 - 00:13:17.526, Speaker C: And so I love the experiment that we're seeing, like what Peter's doing with Verizon, where I don't know if you originate this term or somebody else did, it was like play to earn and kind of giving a way to enter into an economy through participation. So I think that's an interesting model and I'd love to see that get proved out a little more. We're seeing a lot of variations now where people are building this financial stack. So for everyone who watched the D Five panel before, I think a lot of the projects represented did launch their own token early before they had a broadly used product. It may have been functional but it wasn't in that product market fit yet. And now we're starting to see more protocols like Compound which is this money market protocol, uniswap, which is this exchange protocol that are launching and they don't have a token as their business model but they may evolve into it or they may build another type of business model on top of that. And so I wish I could be like here's the new web Three business model.
00:13:17.526 - 00:13:38.026, Speaker C: I don't think we have that yet. But I love the speed of experimentation and the fact that we seem to, at least for now, have gotten past the phase of we're going to sell a token and people are going to use it and the value is going to go up. It's getting a lot more nuanced and sophisticated than know.
00:13:38.048 - 00:14:15.674, Speaker B: One of the things I think Peter mentioned earlier was the value that's created by participants in the system, not just the individuals that are up at the very top of it. In our industry it would be like the content creators, not just the journalists and so forth. And I think also to Dan's point earlier about advertising and the role that played in the web. I mean advertising has been there since the beginning, since 95. We had double click was there. 1995 net Gravity was born in the apartment of John Danner and Tom Shields visiting. And so what I love to see is that we're starting to understand that value is produced in some non traditional ways.
00:14:15.674 - 00:14:45.970, Speaker B: We start to see value produced by individuals on Reddit, individuals on Twitter. And what Brave is doing is we're actually taking some of the value that's put into the system from advertisers these traditional endpoints. We're able to circulate that through to the people that have created a lot of the value that haven't been getting the appreciation they deserve for many years. And so I love that we're actually able to create a way for people to actually transfer value in these nontraditional formats as well, these nontraditional platforms.
00:14:48.390 - 00:15:51.846, Speaker D: Yeah, I do see that web Three enables a lot of new ways to generate value and share value. I do also see that the lines are starting to blur between web Three and web Two. I come from infrastructure background, I like building tools for developers and I see a lot of great technology being created just in the space that could be useful as infrastructure in even the web Two world. So partly of that is like Key Mansion or Secret management that could be really useful for this kind of new local first application movement which preserves privacy. So I see a lot of applications in the traditional world as well. So I do see that's a potential direction for many web Three companies as well. So I actually want to take a hypothetical scenario where just the extreme of.
00:15:51.868 - 00:15:53.800, Speaker C: The opposite of what you just said.
00:15:54.170 - 00:16:22.740, Speaker D: Now that you get the ability to, in a way, price every transaction anywhere from a click to an interaction, do you think that kind of converges how we think about Internet or how information should be free or not free? Or does that mean we're just going to see a world where you have to pay money for accessing everything? And also in general, does that force more finance related things on the web? How much do you worry about that? Does that matter? Do you care about this? Is that even a real concern for each of you?
00:16:24.710 - 00:17:20.498, Speaker E: I'll start I actually don't think you could even enforce that if you wanted to. Information can duplicate, right? So that's kind of what yeah, you'd just be on BitTorrent or something. But let's see how does it change the interactions? I think what ends up happening is by incentivizing more people, you get deeper and ever expanded, like richer content. And that's kind of what's the point. That's why I talked about web One and Two in the fact what open standards do versus closed systems. Because you guys may remember for the Netscape thing, remember like AOL online, like how awesome it looked actually, and it had all these amazing things, but it wasn't an open system. And how could you build a business on such a closed ecosystem? Even like the idea of doing business together? I think it offers for example, in our game we use Dai and Arcadium Coin, which is actually a stable currency we use as our base.
00:17:20.498 - 00:17:59.840, Speaker E: Kind of like, think of it like Epic V bucks, but that are decentralized and work across ecosystems. But we don't have a commercial agreement with Dai or Banker Dow. We know of each other, but we never talked about working together. I just leveraged their technology. So I think the permissionless ability to do business together creates the right incentives to allow you to build these platforms. That creates exponential output in production of more interesting things and creates new opportunities to actually make an income. And finally, I would just also just think about something like Twitter, which we all use and we really enjoy.
00:17:59.840 - 00:18:30.060, Speaker E: You guys may have remembered the stories of when they released their APIs and started kept changing their opinion as to the guidelines as to what you could or could not do in web Three ecosystem. That's not really problem anymore, right? Because it's part of similar to web One. And the whole ethos, it encourages interoperability and building on top of it adds benefit to the layer underneath it as well. Creates more utility, essentially, which creates more value. That's what I think about.
00:18:32.370 - 00:19:20.398, Speaker C: I think even if we get to the point where every packet of data is essentially monetized, you have to pay for it for someone to store it, deliver it, that's still going to get bundled. Like most people are not going to be paying per packet, there will always be somebody who will come provide some other higher margin service on top and they'll be willing to eat that cost in order to have your business on their higher margin product. So I don't think that's going away. That's not going to happen. There's a great classic Nick Zabo post about mental accounting barriers to micro payments. And for people like micro payments generally are referring to sub $0.05 or sub $0.01
00:19:20.398 - 00:19:43.320, Speaker C: payments which are not possible with credit cards based on the fee models today. And so there are technologies that are being developed in the web, three space that allow for sub penny payments to actually be economically viable and I think that will be used for certain infrastructure but that generally won't get exposed at the consumer level.
00:19:44.090 - 00:20:37.000, Speaker D: Yeah, top that. That would enable a lot of new ways for infrastructure to charge right, and something that's more fair that is based on actual usage of the infrastructure versus something like charging for active users a month, you can now charge on the activities. But yeah, generally I think it's important for protocols to be open and really transparent to kind of build trust so that other companies can build on top of it. I do see potentially two models where the protocol layer can make money and then the application the company kind of builds on top of that makes money as well. In one case is docker. Open source is really open. It's ran a pretty transparent way, at least for the open source project.
00:20:37.000 - 00:20:55.690, Speaker D: But as open source project it has incentivization aligning issues. Right. So I could potentially foresee that new open source models could adopt the blockchain in order to align sentence of all the participants.
00:20:56.610 - 00:20:57.070, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:20:57.140 - 00:22:01.440, Speaker B: With Brave there is an invisible transfer value by default that the user is maybe not even aware of oftentimes. So the way the whole system works is advertiser dollars go in, they're converted into tokens, users browse the web, the browser keeps a private local summary of the sites you visit and how much time you spend on each one, including properties like YouTube channels, Twitter accounts, so forth. And then at the end of each month there's value transferred out proportional to the amount of time spent on those properties to those publishers themselves. And so I think there's going to be these emerging economies of just invisible value being transferred all the time. I'd hate to see stuff I think I mentioned before that's content just being locked away behind Paywalls and more stuff where you have to manually and then forcefully exert the friction to get access to that. But so far I'm very optimistic that things will continue to be open. If there is necessity for value to be transferred, it's going to continue to do it in a friction free and pretty fluid way.
00:22:02.770 - 00:22:56.766, Speaker C: Why I mentioned like the mental accounting barriers for micro payments. I think there's actually ways that we can use human psychology to enable new models. And so I love what Brave does in terms of letting you set your monthly budget that you're going to contribute to the websites you visit, and then it automatically splits your payment proportionally across those sites. I think that's great, even when it's not mandatory, when you can get people to opt in. And I think of it as a very interesting parallel. There's a company in the energy space called Opower, and their big thing is they've created these amazing bills that customers receive. The utility companies work with them, and it basically tells you how you're doing on conserving energy relative to your neighbors, relative to the low energy users in your neighborhood.
00:22:56.766 - 00:23:35.866, Speaker C: And it kind of gets this sense of competition going or social obligation going. And it's been incredibly effective at getting people to use less energy. And I think similar tactics can be applied where, even if payment isn't mandatory, that people want to be good citizens, and we can kind of shape the experience and make a great default experience to encourage them to pay even when they strictly don't have right. We've seen different artists and filmmakers do these pay what you can models and make actually a lot of money out of it. I think this will be something that we'll see more and more commonly.
00:23:35.978 - 00:24:16.890, Speaker B: I think one of the things we're realizing is that there has always been a demographic out there that has wanted to support content creators. They've wanted to pay, but to have to get your wallet out, to get your credit card out, to put that into someone else's system, to not have any idea where or how it's being stored, and then to eventually find out someday in the future that you've been Pwned, no one wants to do that. It's not very popular. Plus you don't want to manage multiple different platforms. Got to have your Patreon account and all the other competitors and stuff, depending on who the creator supports. And so I think we're seeing, yeah, people just love the idea of supporting content creators. They want to they just need a lower friction barrier to entry.
00:24:17.710 - 00:24:19.130, Speaker D: That makes a lot of sense.
00:24:19.280 - 00:24:22.000, Speaker C: And I guess kind of with that.
00:24:22.450 - 00:24:34.530, Speaker D: Apart from just the obvious UX and key management issues, what do you think the biggest barriers are, technical or otherwise, that prevents people or prevents web3.
00:24:34.600 - 00:24:36.610, Speaker C: From going to billions of users?
00:24:38.390 - 00:26:15.940, Speaker D: Like anything you fear that could be a big hurdle? Other than those two things, I think it's definitely the divide. Right? So there's like this invisible line between web two and web3 that kind of inhibits us finding what actually bridges these two worlds. We did a user research for our interface, and we realized that a lot of mainstream users are familiar with Bitcoin, but in terms of east DeFi all these new concepts is very foreign to them. And if we put BTC on the interface, people will understand that if we put east, they're like, what is that like? Definitely, I think we should be kind of consolidating digital currency as a whole as a general concept because taking out your credit card and all that is such a jarring experience. It would be great if you have a balance somewhere that goes around. But I think the consolidation of this cryptocurrency, especially maybe to Bitcoin, maybe something else, would really benefit instrument adoption. Because users are already familiar with digital currency concept, because they use Venmo and Square and all.
00:26:19.030 - 00:26:53.470, Speaker C: Seeing one thing. You mentioned digital currency, and it's been coming up more and more recently, and I just started really hating the term because the dollar is digital today, largely speaking. Right? And cryptocurrency is scary. People have really negative associations. A term that I've been kind of playing around with, kind of like is like internet native money, right? It's not native to any nation state. It's not native to any particular company. It's just internet money or internet native money.
00:26:53.470 - 00:27:07.330, Speaker C: I think maybe that captures the ethos that we're going for here and really divides it also from some of these potential national issued digital crypto style currencies.
00:27:07.910 - 00:27:51.338, Speaker B: I think it was Mark Andreessa who said it was one of the web's original sins that we didn't have some type of currency or value system built in. But then again, they faced many challenges in the 90s with exporting software, with stronger cryptography, so forth. But one of the other things that I think that is a barrier to better adoption is we have this far better model. I think Ethereum and basically all these blockchain projects are so much better when it comes to trust. But the thing they don't really help with is user comfort. So if I lose, if I send 100 Ethereum to the wrong address, it's just gone. It's not retrievable.
00:27:51.338 - 00:28:18.460, Speaker B: However, if someone takes my Visa card from my wallet or gets my address or my number or something like that and they use it well, then I can recover those funds. Usually the bank is there to help me with that. And so there are people that are starting to think about those types of problems as well because it's kept some people from wanting to get into this industry because there's not that trust and rip side, that reliance that the system is going to protect them. And so I think that's going to help considerably as well when those problems begin to be solved more in the future.
00:28:19.550 - 00:29:24.186, Speaker E: Yeah. So I think the only thing separating us between realizing on web3 and now is just time. And honestly, I think in terms of usability in UX, we know it's all there. I think whether it's Metatransactions or wallets, two factor smart contract wallets that are being developed, handling kind of bank recovery systems and acting in that way, I think there's all the people. We just need more events, more East Global events, to be honest, to bring people together, to educate developers and more development tools to actually simplify and bring people onto the system and educating kind of the use cases that are novel and that really make sense. And like all things in technology, it's a bit of like pattern discovery and how do you apply these things through a common thread and then making them easy to use and then offering those benefits at scale. And what's cool about that's, what's great about open systems is you get the exponential scale because of the interoperability and even more so because of the lack of kind of risk in terms of collaboration.
00:29:24.186 - 00:29:40.930, Speaker E: You actually can enable mass collaboration. So I think we just need time, honestly. And it's not scalability. It's not a thing that's getting solved by a number of individuals. Not even eats two, even one eats one. It's not the wallets. There's like five great smart contract platforms.
00:29:40.930 - 00:30:01.660, Speaker E: I think the one where we'll kind of land on ultimately that will hold teams back and I think there'll be great infrastructure companies that come out, of course, is security. Right? Managing these economies and managing these assets and regulatory issues is definitely a thing. Money laundering is a concern, all of these sort of things. But I don't think we're far away.
00:30:02.430 - 00:30:16.762, Speaker D: That'S great to wrap up. What is one fun or interesting web3 thing you played with recently that you think the people in the audience should check out other than your own.
00:30:16.816 - 00:30:19.740, Speaker B: Game to break down?
00:30:23.470 - 00:30:56.680, Speaker E: I love ethers. JS of course, the Nomic Labs guys are doing beautiful work on development tools. I'm obviously a major fan of the roll up work that's happening in layer two. Obviously, the stational work that the stational team is doing is amazing and kind of bringing that together across a group of people. And I really think smart contract wallets are absolutely crucial. They offer a lot of important usability improvements with security. So that's me so far.
00:30:58.790 - 00:31:01.086, Speaker C: Yeah. On the technical side, I'm really excited.
00:31:01.118 - 00:31:03.066, Speaker D: About a lot of the meta transaction.
00:31:03.198 - 00:31:42.210, Speaker C: L two stuff that's happening from a consumer perspective and I'm going to disclose do have a relationship here. So this is not entirely unbiased, but there's a really cool company protocol called Pool Together where they've got this gamified savings. So you're depositing dai, this kind of digital dollar and it's going into compound, which is money market protocol. But every week all the interest is being collected together and one person randomly wins that and anybody can withdraw their principal at any time. But it kind of gamifies savings. And this has been done before. A number of different countries have done it.
00:31:42.210 - 00:32:08.362, Speaker C: It's been different pilot programs. And what it generally tends to do is it gets people who are in almost like gambling or lottery playing mindset and it converts that into a saving behavior. So their principle is protected and it starts to build new behaviors and. We can do this. Now at global scale, that's building off multiple primitives that have been created in this space.
00:32:08.416 - 00:32:08.586, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:08.608 - 00:32:24.400, Speaker C: It's building off the maker system, which enables Dai, the stablecoin, it's building off compound, which enables this borrowing and lending protocol. So I think it's really cool. It's been very compelling for people who haven't tried any kind of crypto or web3 apps yet.
00:32:25.110 - 00:33:16.180, Speaker D: Yeah, for me, I've been generally interested in DApps that helps users earn cryptocurrency. That's basically one of the best ways to get adoption is to just pay people with it. One DAP is called Sent. So essentially it's a decentralized social network and you can post all these nice posts and then you can seed or stake on the post. And if the post actually takes off the original poster and the early seeders get to earn cryptocurrency and one of the users actually made enough to buy a bike for his daughter. And when I saw that, it was like, whoa. You're actually, by earning crypto, you're impacting other people's lives.
00:33:16.180 - 00:34:09.710, Speaker D: And on top of that, given all of this digital nomad like globalization, global workforce, self sovereign workers trends, I'm really into a project called Opolis. So basically, they would help these digital nomads get paid in cryptocurrency and they'll make sure that it's really compliant. They do all the hard work to do that. And the last one I've been pretty obsessed with are new token and funding models. One is called a Continuous organization. It's really cool way to use funding curves to guarantee liquidity and you can automatically market with a smart contract. It's very enticing, potentially to investors.
00:34:10.210 - 00:34:36.602, Speaker B: I want to piggyback off what Sean says. Well, the joy in seeing people earn their first tokens, it used to be the case, you'd have to mine it and that takes considerable technical know how then people would be able to buy them. But so many people are just earning their first Opens these days. It's super exciting. Especially Brave is obviously very biased, but this is also a genuine answer. It is one of the most exciting applications of the technology that I've seen in such a long time.
00:34:36.736 - 00:34:37.946, Speaker E: I spend a lot of time on.
00:34:37.968 - 00:35:03.010, Speaker B: Twitter, part of my job, fortunately. And so I get to see people elated every month when they receive their payouts for participating in Raymads without having to divulge any of their private information to anybody whatsoever. It's so neat to see waves and waves of normal, everyday people coming into this industry in such a low friction manner. And so it has been an absolute joy.
00:35:05.270 - 00:35:06.018, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:35:06.104 - 00:35:06.450, Speaker B: Awesome.
