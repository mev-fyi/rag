00:00:07.370 - 00:00:38.380, Speaker A: So up next, I want to invite four amazing people here. We're going to be talking about everything on Fem from a builder's perspective. So we have Sean, Natalie and Kate talking about all the things that they're doing. And Nikki from Protocol apps will be moderating this conversation. And we're going to cover all the things that all of you can look forward to as you're building with Fem. So Nikki, Shannon, Natalie and Kate. Welcome.
00:00:39.870 - 00:00:40.620, Speaker B: Hi.
00:00:42.510 - 00:00:45.420, Speaker A: I'll let you kick it off and take it from here.
00:00:47.310 - 00:01:38.902, Speaker B: I'm really excited to be here listening to all the talks since the summit started, and there's been a lot of talks about all the different technologies people can build on. So we are going to switch gears a little bit with this panel. And I hope this panel becomes an inspiring session for you guys to go and build out projects. So hackathons are a great place to learn and try out different things and hack on ideas and build them out. But then there are also places where bigger stories start. And this panel is to share some of these success stories. So I won't keep talking and I will let all of you introduce yourself maybe and briefly share what your projects are about and what they do, what problems they solve.
00:01:38.902 - 00:01:42.110, Speaker B: So maybe let's start with Kate.
00:01:43.010 - 00:02:15.698, Speaker C: Sure. Hi, I'm Kate Wong from Astifu Protocol. So Astifill is the first liquid sticking protocol launch on FBM. We're live now since twelveTH of April. So what we're doing is to connect filecoin token holder and storage provider by offering a decentralized sticking experience and also leverage farming. So if you are state storage provider, you can onboard your node on our platform and then we will provide higher profitability. And if you're a token holder, you do not have a lock in period, but you can stick your money in our protocol.
00:02:15.698 - 00:02:50.580, Speaker C: So our APY is ranging from ten to 20% now based on the market driven interest rate. So the interest is compounded every second. So it's solving the efficiency problem in Falcon money. So that within just six weeks we have more than 200,000 Falcon stick already and 160 for a drastic already. And now we're joining the Ally Ventures IPFS based Camp Bullhurt and that's why we are here. And also I'm really glad that we have this opportunity to talk with you guys and please try our protocol Sdfow IO. Thank you.
00:02:52.710 - 00:02:57.640, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. Natalie, maybe you can go next.
00:02:58.250 - 00:03:20.966, Speaker D: Absolutely. Yeah. So I would rather say actually that we don't just have one project or just a project. Yeah. Basically, I would say we're a Phil Fox team. So I'm pretty sure since you guys are building on FVM or you are protocol apps and stuff, you know what, that Phil Fox Explorer itself. Yeah, it's basically the most popular data service in the filecoin ecosystem.
00:03:20.966 - 00:04:04.774, Speaker D: Right. And even if you go to the actual website, the first option would be Phil Fox actually, which I'm very proud of. And yeah, basically we provide the one stop on chain data display and aggregation services for the filecoin users. The Fixed Filthbox Explorer now fully supports Fevm, which can analyze data, for example, like contracts and event blogs, right. And also opens the contract verification functions to the community. So Foxwood has sorry, Fox oh my gosh, film. Fox has just announced our roadmap, actually, and we just sent it out to all our partners as well as on our Twitter.
00:04:04.774 - 00:05:02.302, Speaker D: So you're more than welcome to have a look at it and stuff. So we'll try to actively work on Philpox because it's been, I think, almost four years of existence, right? But now we're going to be trying to kind of work very much as well on the social side, know, kind of try to let our partners as well as filecoin understand what we are doing there as well. Try to evolve as well in a lot of ways. And yeah, as you might know, we also have other projects that we build as a fillbox team. So one of them is FNS Space, or Fnsdao, which is basically a fill domain name, which is not only a domain name because you can actually control or I like to say control, though, it's more like you can kind of register or give your dot fill domain name to your miners as well through the fill fox. So that's a pretty cool thing considering it's a domain name. Yeah, the other domain names that don't really have this kind of function.
00:05:02.302 - 00:05:33.222, Speaker D: So it's pretty cool. And I believe it's a very good thing for the filecoin itself ecosystem. And also FNS has actually been integrated by Sft St, phil Kate shout out there as well as Phil Fox, Fox Wallet and other partners as well. And as you might know, we also taken a big part in developing Fox Wallet itself, which has reached pretty good numbers as of now. So. Yeah. Bill, fox team here.
00:05:33.222 - 00:05:34.520, Speaker D: Thank you so much.
00:05:35.370 - 00:05:38.680, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, maybe, Shannon, you can go next.
00:05:39.690 - 00:06:03.710, Speaker E: Yeah, super excited. So, I'm co founder and CTO at Link, and at Link, we are building GameFi infrastructure, allowing game developers to build their web3 games in just a couple of minutes, integrating the web3 aspects inside the game. So we are making blockchain gaming accessible for everyone, allowing game developers to ship fast, build fast, and even fail faster as well without worrying about any blockchain complexities.
00:06:05.670 - 00:06:45.840, Speaker B: Cool stuff. And, yeah, maybe let's segue into your journeys on building out products using FBM or in the filecoin ecosystem. Because I'm sure it's been a journey where you've been curious, maybe excited. Then you started building something, then oh, and then you are stuck at some point, and then there's like you're looking for support, looking out everywhere, maybe being part of hackathons or other builder programs. And then finally you had the oh, yes, it works moment, right? So maybe let's walk through your journeys and any of you please.
00:06:50.400 - 00:06:51.004, Speaker E: Yes.
00:06:51.122 - 00:07:33.470, Speaker C: I guess the builder journey is super excited. I think that few things that critical resources that can help us is like familiarity with the Falcon ecosystem because some of our team members working around the falcon ecosystem for like two years and then that makes us familiar with the Fem and also Falco ecosystem. And the second thing is like a close communication with the protocols and also Filecoin or Slack, because Slack is a good stuff that you can ask any question and you can get firm reply easily. And the last thing is our cohesive and experienced team that we bound together and then to work for something good. And also one thing to thank you is the Olive Ventures base camp. That really helped a lot.
00:07:38.720 - 00:08:32.364, Speaker D: All right, let me dive in then. I would like to just say absolutely agree with everything Kate has just mentioned. And probably I would add that for Phil Fox team it was a bit sort of easier, at least recently because we already had a big experience in building on kind of like we were already very familiar and understood all the technical details of Filecoin very. So for example, building FNS was kind of like sort of easier in this way. So once we, for example, we participated in the hackathon in, I think it was December 2022, right? So it was kind of like probably easier in the way. But at the same time I'm personally a BD member, right? So I do business development. So there is a certain part of my job where I kind of get involved, right? But when it comes to building, of course I don't know as much.
00:08:32.364 - 00:09:28.850, Speaker D: But what I do know and the feedback that I got from the team was basically the most important thing is obviously official documents. There's always a white paper, there is always the docs there that you have to look at and as it was mentioned by Slack. So you have to always keep communicating as well as networking as well as understanding what's happening, all the updates and know. So this way you can understand basically all the compatibility differences of the Fem in the quickest way possible, right? And in general, at least from our experience, the Fem team as well as the East Global team, they were super helpful as well throughout the whole, let's say building hackathon building period as well. So it was pretty cool. And obviously the whole team has to kind of sink in together and when one person is freaking out, the other one has got to be like, okay, I got to put this in my hands and then the opposite. So that's how it was.
00:09:31.060 - 00:09:54.212, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll go next. I have been a game developer. I'm a builder, so I am a developer. I love to build and I love building, I love coding. So what I do is I have been running a game studio for more than five years. I'm a game developer. And this entire journey started because in 2020, we have already built more than 60 plus games, hyper casual, casual games.
00:09:54.212 - 00:10:25.200, Speaker E: And in 2020, when we created our first Web Three game, we stuck upon a problem. That infrastructure side of the Web Three stack is completely broken. And that's when it all started, because we created a Web Two game in just one week. But just to convert that Web Two game to Web Three, it took us almost two months. And that's when we figured out that a lot of resources are not available in the space at the moment. The complete infrastructure is completely broken. There is nothing, no information as such, which is available in the market.
00:10:25.200 - 00:11:16.976, Speaker E: And we had $0 in our bank account. And when we started link so that's when we figured out the problem. We started working on the infrastructure side, we started fixing the problem. We started simplifying the blockchain stack for any game developer to create a Web Three game. And we have also participated in multiple hackathons because I believe that hackathon is something that brings the best out of a team building, team a developer or anything, because you have a deadline, you have only 48 hours, you have only seven days to build a product and ship it out. And I also created a product till the last two minutes before I have to push it and the deadline is about to end. So it brings the best out of a developer, it brings them out of a comfort zone and it increases that hunger to build out the stuff that you wanted to build since a very long time.
00:11:16.976 - 00:12:09.540, Speaker E: Right? And the last hackathon that we participated was Feron Dapathon and we won in the Mantle Pool Prize and we created the NFT deployer working on top of Mantle. Then we have also been leveraging Filecoin ecosystem since a very long time, I think since more than a year now, because that stack is completely decentralized. So every in game asset that is stored on IPFS is pinned with Filecoin. And when Fevm came, we have been leveraging Fevm as well, with all our capacity and how we can leverage the power of Fevm and Filecoin at all the possible ways. And we have also created the dynamic NFT standards in a Filecoin hackathon, which happened, I think, six months back. So, like, hackathon has been a great game changer for us as well. And I believe that any builder out there must participate in hackathons.
00:12:10.360 - 00:12:10.964, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:12:11.082 - 00:12:11.460, Speaker E: Cool.
00:12:11.530 - 00:12:39.070, Speaker B: Maybe I can ask you the next question, Shanu, so you continue along the same line. So, say when you go to Hackathons and you see these 20 different projects and all of them look like fun and exciting, right? And you are like, which one do I pick now? How do I start? What's that process like? And what advice would you give to the hackers at Hack FS on how to find their way, like what to pick.
00:12:40.320 - 00:13:42.432, Speaker E: So I've also seen multiple companies just built out of hackathon. They have just created a POC in the hackathon and later on they have become a multimillion dollar company because that POC was something that was solving the real issues of the people. So I believe that once you are participating in hackathon you have the hunger to solve a problem. Now that if I have an option to choose among 20 other projects that which one I should build, the first thing will be how many problem will I be able to solve with the product, whichever I go with. So if I'm going with one product that doesn't solve the problem but it is super exciting to just show it off with other people, then I would rather remove that out of my to do list and choose something that actually solves the problem for multibillion people. Not even multibillion people. Even if I'm solving the problem of 1000 members thousand people, I would be happy to do that because right now we have like for example when we started we don't had any game developers building on top of us because we were just trying to solve the entire tech stack for everybody out there.
00:13:42.432 - 00:14:11.450, Speaker E: But now we have more than 100 plus game projects for building on top of Link. And when I look at those projects it feels like okay, now we have done something grateful for them that they are able to leverage our tech and they are able to integrate the web3 elements that took us almost two months to do and they are able to do that in just two minutes. So that's one thing that I would look for that if you are building something, look out for the problem that you are solving for the people and hackathon is one of the best opportunity to do that out there.
00:14:12.640 - 00:14:22.140, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah. Maybe Kate and Natalie you can go next and just like what's the advice you would give to hackers at hackerfest?
00:14:23.040 - 00:15:37.808, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say maybe two keywords that one is pivots and confidence. Because from what at the beginning we are running the FBM Open Hack day that we are not using Astifu as the product because we pivot a little bit at that time. Sdfue is a large product but like, you know, hackathon is like a super short period of time. So that we just pivot and extra crucial part, this is called W fill and then that part will be easier for us to do and we are more confident in do that. And with that part we like submitting deadline this approaching next Monday. Then our team confirmed the plan on Tuesday and interface on Wednesday, document on Thursday and then video Friday and then submit it over the weekend so it's super packed and then it require lots of strike skills and also early planning and also autompleting. So for a little bit advice or maybe a little bit further explore, I would suggest that hackers can go to visit FVM filecoin IO that part called what does FVN Unlock? Because Fen is like a completely open playing field with unlimited opportunities.
00:15:37.808 - 00:15:46.250, Speaker C: There's so many things that can think about and also the workshop that we are having today that will be help a lot.
00:15:48.140 - 00:15:48.890, Speaker B: Cool.
00:15:50.460 - 00:16:09.968, Speaker D: Of course, I would totally agree and totally sign up with everything that Shannon and Kate said. So, first of all, yeah, you got to bring the value. Second, you got to have the arrangement, the right arrangement, you know, how the team works. And I guess it also proves a lot of what kind of team you are and how I wouldn't say maybe reliable you are in general. Right. Because it's pretty important. Right.
00:16:09.968 - 00:16:38.360, Speaker D: So, yeah, in terms of value, for example, what is important for us because we built FNS, which is a fill domain name, right. So we were thinking, well, domain name apart from like because first of all, at that time, which was December 2022, right? It was the time when the domain names in general for different chains and networks, they were thriving. Right. It was crazy. Everybody's super hyped up and stuff. So it kind of like marketing wise and stuff. It made a lot of sense.
00:16:38.360 - 00:16:59.612, Speaker D: Second, generally, domain names, they give you this branding. So this would give the Filecoin itself or FBM. Yeah, the big, big branding itself. Right. Because the more projects integrate fill domain name, the more kind of visibility it brings to filecoin itself. Right. So that's one of the values that we saw.
00:16:59.612 - 00:17:32.488, Speaker D: And the second one, obviously, was the fact that we also created the minor domain service as well through the fillbox. So it was like a whole kind of inter kind of connection there. So that's what we saw in that. And so it was like a perfect combination there. And of course, the arrangement, as I mentioned. Yeah, one person freaks out, another one goes like, okay, we got to take over this because what happened, for example, to us, I'm the BD, right? But I was also kind of like I was taking care of the making video and the presentation and stuff. And there was like 300 recordings and stuff.
00:17:32.488 - 00:17:56.732, Speaker D: And I just only took care of that. And then when it came to actual presentation, which was at 03:00 A.m. For me, and I remember Steven, who is our main developer, he was like, I think I can undo it. So I was like, okay, I'm going to take care of this. So it was like a whole you got to take care of each other. And that's what is the beauty of it. But at the same time, it's important for the teams to understand, okay, if so what? We have each other's back.
00:17:56.732 - 00:18:27.230, Speaker D: Yeah, we know how to help each other in a certain situation because somebody is very good at, I don't know, building somebody is good at speaking, somebody is good at whatever because it's a difficult kind of thing to do, right? You can have a fantastic project, but a lot of things also depend on how you kind of present it as well. It's the world, this is how humanity works. But anyway, that's what I would say. Yeah, super agree with everything Kate and Shanu have mentioned, so I kind of sum it all up.
00:18:27.760 - 00:19:37.992, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think you touch upon a couple of really important points that hackers often either don't think about or at least in my conversations that I've had every time I've gone to an in person. Hackathon is like, even if you are an already existing big team, you can still go to a hackathon and build something out from scratch and then you never know, it becomes a part of your product later or it gives you ideas and you get to explore tools that you might end up using in very different ways. And I think the second part that I really like is that, yes, hackathons are great for developers, but then you also need a lot of other people to turn your projects into actual companies later. So hackathons are also a great place to find such people. So no matter whether you are not a developer, you'll meet developers at a hackathon or if you are a developer, you'll meet other storytellers that you might meet at some point as you continue building out your project. So, yeah, this was awesome. I loved hearing your stories.
00:19:37.992 - 00:19:45.060, Speaker B: I hope hackers found inspiration in it too. And yeah, hope to see you guys again on some other panel someday.
00:19:47.400 - 00:19:50.870, Speaker E: Thank you. Likewise. Thank you for having.
00:19:53.880 - 00:20:17.180, Speaker A: To say. Well, Kate Chan and Natalie, thank you so much for that amazing discussion and it was really good insights. And I think the takeaway is that kind of do some of the enjoy doing and it's better to solve a problem for 100 people who really have something than 1000 people that may have probably a problem. So focus on that, especially as you have limited time. And Nikki, thank you so much for facilitating that amazing conversation.
00:20:17.760 - 00:20:19.496, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Karthik.
00:20:19.608 - 00:20:20.090, Speaker A: Take care everybody.
