00:00:04.260 - 00:00:36.144, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, just bear with us while we get the live stream set up. Thanks. Welcome again. And I'm delighted to welcome Felipe and Luis here from the MakerDAO team. They're going to give a presentation on how MakerDAO keeps building on Dai. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to pop them in the chat and we can take them towards the end. And yeah, I'll let you take the stage.
00:00:36.144 - 00:00:38.550, Speaker A: Luis and Felipe. Thanks.
00:00:39.160 - 00:01:03.150, Speaker B: Okay, thank you so much. So, yeah, we're going to talk about how MakerDAO keeps building a die. Philippe and I, we work for the Maker Growth core unit that is a working group for yeah, I am most of the part of the support operations and Philippe is our checklist. So, yeah, we're going to start. Philippe, if you can.
00:01:06.720 - 00:01:31.220, Speaker C: So hi everyone. My name is Trip. I'm working at the growth coordinates in the Maker. Really? And yeah, we're here to talk to you about how we are continuing to build around and support Dai as the ecosystem keeps on growing.
00:01:33.000 - 00:02:46.360, Speaker B: Yeah, so please, next slide. Basically, let's start with what is or who is the Dao or MakerDAO itself. So makerDo is one of the oldest DAOs that is split around. We can talk about MakerDAO right now into different components like MakerDAO, the whole global Dao itself, that is composed by the whole Maker community, the protocol, the stakeholders, us as the core units and all the people that is joined in the Dao that is working towards the healthy of the protocol. And then there is the second component that is basically the Maker protocol itself, that is like the set of smart contracts that die alive into the ethereum Mainet. So basically, we are since last year a full decentralized Dao since the dissolving of the Maker foundation. And right now, the whole Maker Dao team is composed by different working groups that are called care units.
00:02:46.360 - 00:03:34.184, Speaker B: They are the ones that are giving their services to the Dao. Basically, for example, us at Growth, we are doing the work for partnerships and basically try to increase the Dai demand all around Mainet and other parts. Yeah, basically all around MakerDAO works. Thank you to the governance. The maker governance. There is like the process where the MKR token holders vote for whatever regards to the Maker Dao or to the protocol itself. For example, the parameters are on Dai, what core units are going to be working for the Dao, what collateral are going to be backing Dai.
00:03:34.184 - 00:04:17.048, Speaker B: And so, yeah, this leads us to our starter that is basically Dai. So Dai is this decentralized stablecoin that is over collateralized. So as I said, it's based on over collateralized lending. And as right now, it's one of the most trusted stablecoins in the whole space. So as Dai is over collateralized, as you can see right now, it is not super affected by the market movements. Multiple systems are in place to make dai one of the most useful stable coins all around the decentralized finance, if you can. Yeah, so yeah, let's talk a little bit about how they works.
00:04:17.048 - 00:05:43.680, Speaker B: It's like super simple as you may know in MakerDAO so people can come with whatever collateral that we accept in MakerDAO. It can be ETH, it can be WBTC, it can be Comp, it can be USDC through the BSM or whatever crypto. So you go and interact with MakerDAO from these collaterals you start minting Dai. So for every Dai you mint, you create a maker vault and then these vaults have stability fees that we, let's say kind of control through the governance process as we mentioned before, in order to keep the die peg to the US dollar. So basically, when Dai is trading above the one dollars peg, what we do is that these stability fees, let's say we lower them so we increase the desire of people of Minting Dai and flu them at the market. So Dai keeps the peg with a dollar and in the opposite side, when Dai is trading below the one dollars target, what we do is that we increase a little bit the stability fees so we encourage people to repay basically their loans inside MakerDAO and then take a little bit of the die in the market. So we basically reach the one dollars peg.
00:05:43.680 - 00:07:07.932, Speaker B: Yeah, so the maker vaults are basically like the core part of the whole maker protocol that are the smart contracts that enable everyone, whoever wants to interact with the protocol to mint eye by locking collateral on it. As you can see in the slides, there are many interfaces, for example Instadap, DeFiSaver, Oasis that are the ones that provide this service to maker. And yeah, like whatever protocol we accept, whatever collateral sorry, we accept in the protocol you can mint die against it as much as the debt ceiling of the vault allows you because every vault has a debt ceiling that is the maximum amount that you can basically mint in terms of die. And then for example, if this debt ceiling comes to a maximum, the maker governance process comes in again and basically the MKR token holders can vote for the debt ceiling to be increased or to be decreased if there is no much demand on the collaterals. That's basically how the vaults and the protocol works. Another pretty important part of the protocol itself are the maker Oracles. We don't use for example chainlink as most of all the other players in the ecosystem, we use our own Oracle.
00:07:07.932 - 00:08:37.470, Speaker B: So any lending protocol as maker relies on the price of the Oracles, like the price fits of every collateral. So we maintain our own network of decentralized price Oracles and this can be accessed by any DeFi applications because we have ordered in the blockchain. For example, one pretty cool part of our Oracle system is let's say in this market we have a security model that is the OSM or the Oracle Security model that gives you the price feed of every collateral and it always delays the next price for 1 hour. So we always give this kind of opportunity for every vault owner to see how healthy is his or her collateral, so they can take a chance to repay the die, get more collateral into the vault or wherever. So we do this kind of for our users to be more secure on what they are doing, to give them more time when these kind of market situations comes. Yeah, that's basically the most important part of the protocol. And then I'll let you with Felipe who is going to talk to you about the other modules and the features we have.
00:08:38.720 - 00:09:55.220, Speaker C: Basically, as Luis said, there are a couple modules in play when you interact with the Maker protocol and we have to make a strong point about the Maker protocol being quite modular. So there are a lot of different parts that affect either the dye emissions, dye stability, and also there are other parts of the protocol that let you interact in novel ways with Dai and the Maker ecosystem. So everything is basically voted in by governance. After doing a lot of risk analysis and over this couple of years, we've integrated a lot of different functionality that's already available for use by other DeFi protocols. One of our premier integrations is the D three M that stands short for Die Direct Deposit Module. This basically lets the Maker protocol.
00:09:58.140 - 00:09:58.648, Speaker D: Just.
00:09:58.734 - 00:11:28.870, Speaker C: Inject liquidity into other protocols such as Ave and basically provide better interest rate for people who want to borrow Dai on other venues. Sorry, this actually allows people to get dye at better rates that they could get elsewhere and benefits both Maker and Ave and also users. The idea is to make the most available stable coin in the month and letting people just borrow it with whatever collateral they want, always taking into account the permissions that the other protocols give. So for example in Ave you can borrow Die with other crypto collaterals that you might not be able to borrow with in the main maker system. So that expands the possibilities for everyone involved. And the D three M, it is not linked to Ave itself. There's a lot of potential integrations in the works on coming up and also you can build your own projects using the D three M as a source of dialiquidity for whatever needs you have.
00:11:28.870 - 00:12:39.544, Speaker C: Bear in mind obviously that D three M integrations are subject to governance acceptance. So the product that uses the D three M should be secure enough to actually be able to use a D three M integration. One of the most recent cases of D three M integrations hearing the news is our deal with Tesla through another lending protocol. So basically through this other protocol we ended up lending die to Tesla to actually get real world risk running salary centers, that sort of thing. And this is a real power of the ethereum. We can inject liquidity wherever the market needs it. So basically, Maple Finance is one of our partners who actually specializes in uncollateralized lending.
00:12:39.544 - 00:13:54.230, Speaker C: So we can make a strong point about Maker being a little bit more capital efficient in this regard. And the main point of this is that the security model of Dai, we set up a debt ceiling for these integrations and we kind of extend the lending rights to other protocols. So basically we rely on other protocols to do their due diligence and lendai as much as they need. Really. This allows us to scale in a huge fashion because there's no need for crypto collateral in these cases. And real world assets can actually start tapping into crypto collaterals and crypto the DeFi space in general by means of using a stable coin like Dai and just starting to do stuff in the DeFi space. Another interesting.
00:13:55.960 - 00:13:59.430, Speaker D: Development that we've had over.
00:14:01.800 - 00:15:00.456, Speaker C: The stability module that's the PSM. The PSM basically allows you to trade die in or out for. Right now it's three stablecoins USDC, the paxos and Gemini. USD. And the whole idea for this is that we want to build a better system for stablecoin swaps and Maker's ability to mint Dai and burn. It puts it in a very special place to be able to actually expand and contract the dye supply in. Really expand and contract the supply as much as it's needed.
00:15:00.456 - 00:16:11.630, Speaker C: So if people want to drop their USDC for buy and go yield farming, for example, they can just do that on the PSM and they will get that rate one to one. The main point for using the PSM is that it's actually free apart from gas fees. So you can swap to your hardest content without incurring trade fees you can. Another interesting thing that we've seen the PSM used for is actually bridging Dai to the real world via stable coins back to dollars such as USDC or Paxos, just enabling other borrowers to exit. And also the PSM actually allows other actors to arbitrage Dai's peg. So if Dai is trading below the peg, they can buy Dai off the.
00:16:13.840 - 00:16:14.708, Speaker D: USDC.
00:16:14.824 - 00:16:29.450, Speaker C: And if Dai is above the market, they can just deposit USDC and use Dai to make a profit. So we also have another module that's called the Flashbank module.
00:16:29.610 - 00:16:32.880, Speaker D: This is currently free to use.
00:16:35.970 - 00:17:51.218, Speaker C: Free version of Ave and Link protocol. This basically means that you can arbitrage die, you can multiply leverage for free, basically the only thing paying in this case gas fees. And also looking forward to the multi chain strategy that MakerDAO is bringing forward and all this LTE explosion that we've seen. We are actively working on Maker teleport, just leveraging the capabilities that the Dao has actually mint and burn die. So basically this functions via a mint and burn model where you actually die in one chain and that is picked up by an Oracle network that relays a message to the other side. Let's say you're transferring from Magnet to Optimism. For example, you lock your die on Magnet that gets picked up by the Oracle network.
00:17:51.218 - 00:18:50.970, Speaker C: That then sends a message to the L2 and enables you to mint die on that L two. The die that was locked on the original chain just gets burned and it effectively means that you can instantly get your die wherever you need it, whenever you need it. We are rolling this out very soon. It's first going to be on Stocknet and after that we are targeting Optimism to be launched. And this wormhole and this teleportation of Dai actually enables us to actually deploy multilateral Dai on L2 networks. So the gas fees that have been so high for so long, people from single protocol.
00:18:53.550 - 00:18:56.382, Speaker D: Working on L2 being.
00:18:56.436 - 00:20:15.666, Speaker C: Supported and that you can mint and use die on different networks just as if you were on main net. So that's an overview of all the modules that we are holding grants for in this hackathon. Right now we are in grants for a PSM interface. So an interface which lets you coins using our Peg stability module. We have a grant for creating an interface for our collaterals, mostly leverage tokens like Curves. Take these E LP tokens, there's gelato tokens for the UNICEF three DIOC pools, that sort of thing. We have a grant for a flapper distributor so that regards the mechanism in which there's a maker has enough revenue to actually start distributing that revenue to token holders, MKR holders.
00:20:15.666 - 00:21:26.070, Speaker C: So we are actively looking into that. We are also hosting a grant for Cool use case for our Flash Mint module which is currently free. So that's a really useful tool for DeFi projects and protocols that want to just move collateral around. Another really interesting grant that we are hosting is a grant for an Oracle's dashboard. So just looking at the Oracle status of the maker ecosystem, showing the different prices, showing the time delays between these prices, that sort of thing, whatever you can imagine you can do. We will be in the Discord channel to have some discussions. And our last grant for this hackathon is a subgraph for the MKR voting weight.
00:21:26.070 - 00:22:30.430, Speaker C: So right now the MKR governance is based on a delegate system. So people can actually delegate the NKR in their behalf. That's just a byproduct of the gas fees being so high on mainnet. But yeah, we are looking to create some sort of interface that lets people see how MKR is validated and how people actually are able to vote and support their delegates. Yeah, that's it from me. I don't know if there are many questions in the chat channel and if you have any questions, just feel free to drop them in the chat.
00:22:54.120 - 00:23:00.390, Speaker A: It looks like you covered everything in this workshop. There's no questions coming in yet.
00:23:02.040 - 00:23:04.470, Speaker C: Okay? Don't be afraid to ask.
00:23:04.840 - 00:23:48.020, Speaker B: Yeah, also, whatever, we are on the sponsor channel into the E Global Discord Server. So there you can find all the useful links of the documents and you can ask me or Felipe or whoever is over there from the Maker team. Whatever doubts you might have around the projects, the prices and whatever that you are possibly building for MakerDAO or you're interested in doing some of the ones that we put over there, we are in the chat. So, yeah, feel free to reach out anytime.
00:23:51.320 - 00:24:11.960, Speaker C: We are also going to be hosting a series of brainstorming sessions on our official Discord Server for Megadao. So feel free to join Discord Server so we can have a chat and discuss what you want to do with Maker.
00:24:15.340 - 00:24:15.704, Speaker D: Great.
00:24:15.742 - 00:24:21.000, Speaker A: Thanks Felipe and Luis for the session, and we'll follow up over Discord.
00:24:21.380 - 00:24:23.200, Speaker D: You okay?
00:24:23.270 - 00:24:27.650, Speaker B: Amazing. Thank you for the invitation and thank everyone for being here.
00:24:29.140 - 00:24:35.070, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone, for having a nice session with us. Thank.
