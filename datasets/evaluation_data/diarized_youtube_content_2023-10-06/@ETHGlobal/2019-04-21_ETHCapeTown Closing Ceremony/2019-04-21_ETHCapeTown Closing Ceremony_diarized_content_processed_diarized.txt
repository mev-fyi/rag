00:00:02.490 - 00:00:19.390, Speaker A: I'm Devin so I've been your MC for the whole weekend. I just want to thank you all so much for coming through for this weekend. I hope you all had a good weekend. Awesome. I'm so glad to hear. Yeah. So this has been an incredible weekend, I think for everyone.
00:00:19.390 - 00:00:46.314, Speaker A: We've had some really great weather today, which has been amazing. I mean, this venue, it's like sitting in a glass box next to the ocean coding all day. You couldn't probably ask for a more aesthetic hacker venue, which is great. The first day was so full of so much excitement. Everyone was in such a vibe. This is really the kind of atmosphere that we wanted to create was this hackathon and make it really inclusive and make it really happy and powerful. And I think everyone really got together with getting into the vibe of things, making a lot of friends.
00:00:46.314 - 00:01:00.814, Speaker A: We've had a few surprises along the way. We had that incredible musical act last night. We've had a couple of musical sessions in between. It's actually been quite a musical event, very creative. And the meditation session as well. Yesterday was amazing. Thank you to Nicole for organizing that.
00:01:00.814 - 00:01:34.234, Speaker A: But yeah. So now I'm going to just kick off a little bit with a recap of how the hackathon went down. We had 190 attendees, 104 t, four hackers, 69% of which were actually from South Africa. So those are really, really cool numbers. Well done. It's been incredible to see the levels of participation, especially from all of the local Cape Tonians and Johannesburgians Joburgers and everyone else here. So, I mean, everyone as well that traveled far and wide to get here.
00:01:34.234 - 00:02:02.654, Speaker A: We really, really appreciate you taking the time to come down. 42% of all of the hackers were brand new to Ethereum. Like brand, brand new. All of the concepts that they saw here today, they've actually learned, taken and implemented in the period of this weekend. So some of the hackathon projects that did come out of this have been even more impressive because of that. And 15% of the hackers were beginners, so we had some maybe prior knowledge, but we're still very new to Ethereum and Blockchain, so it's been really incredible. In total, we had 33 projects.
00:02:02.654 - 00:02:39.840, Speaker A: 33 projects is an incredibly high number to get out of a hackathon like this. So also round of applause, all of you. Again, it's cool. So I'd like to just it's been a really intense kind of process judging all of these projects because there were some really incredible projects and the level was very high. And I think you've all done very well. But I know the judges have now we've decided on our top four projects. So the top four projects in no particular order, if you could please maybe come to the stage and they're going to give now a quick demo of their projects to you guys and just show you what they've done.
00:02:39.840 - 00:03:05.574, Speaker A: And there's some special mentions as well that we'd like to just say before as well. The presentation demos. Come on. Because there were so many incredible projects, we couldn't put them all into the top four. But you guys did really, really well, and you did impress the judges. So the top four finalists in no particular order are wild Cards. Okay, cool.
00:03:05.574 - 00:03:25.914, Speaker A: Snap, detox and Sebenzai. Cool. I think they're all already here. Cool. So the top special mentions are USSD for all Willow, the Wisp, Altimarkets and Dao versus Dow. Cool. Yeah.
00:03:25.914 - 00:03:37.330, Speaker A: You guys all did very, very well. So I'd like to just bring up to the stage now the first project to demo for you, and that is the Wild Cards. Is it the wild cards?
00:03:40.310 - 00:03:41.474, Speaker B: Are we live already?
00:03:41.592 - 00:03:42.610, Speaker A: Yeah, you're all live.
00:03:42.680 - 00:03:44.580, Speaker B: Are we demoing on the computer or.
00:03:47.610 - 00:03:49.080, Speaker A: Here'S your tech card.
00:03:52.970 - 00:05:00.570, Speaker B: Jayland. Jayla, if you want to start the engine loading rum. Wild Cards. I want you to all imagine we are on a safari. Wild cards is an always for sale tokenization of endangered weight. Wait, a vitalec black rhino. Endangered animals like black rhinos are critical to have funding in order to conserve these species.
00:05:00.570 - 00:06:03.586, Speaker B: So what exactly have we built? We have used a Harbinger tax system to build nonfungible collectible endangered species rhino cards. So what you see over here is a collection of black rhinos that are, most importantly, always for sale. So how does this whole Harbinger tax system work? When you see a rhino that you want, which is always on sale and scarce, you buy it for the current price that it exists at. And whenever you buy it, you have to set the price which you will sell it at. Right. But if you set a really high price which you will sell it at, guess what has to happen? You have to pay tax on that price. You have to pay 5% tax per annum on the price you set to sell it.
00:06:03.586 - 00:06:56.430, Speaker B: And where does this tax go? It goes directly to the Rhino Conservation Fund. And this is how we raise money for critically endangered species. And right on the back end there, our chief engineer is busy making some blockchain transactions and buying the different rhinos. There's Griff, who currently costs two ETH incredible rhino right there. All go and buy griff. And this is the basis of our application. And what we plan to do is extend this to many more endangered species, such that snow leopards, sloths, and a myriad of other endangered species can all stand in line to receive funding as people clamor to buy these scarce cards that represent these individual animals.
00:06:56.430 - 00:07:32.350, Speaker B: And you can also click and see more information on them. And if we go right to the end, let's go right to the end, you'll notice that we get to the end pretty quickly. And why do we get to the end pretty quickly? Because there's not many of these people left. These are scarce guys and we really need to look after them. So we implore you, the community, to buy your favorite Rhino and start paying your hobbit tax to one of these amazing foundations. Thank you so much, guys. Buy your rhinos.
00:07:32.350 - 00:07:43.240, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:07:43.390 - 00:07:57.490, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you so much. Wild Cards. The next project to the stage could please be Snappy. It.
00:08:27.360 - 00:08:28.812, Speaker C: We'Ll just use one is enough.
00:08:28.866 - 00:08:29.550, Speaker D: I think.
00:08:33.840 - 00:08:35.150, Speaker C: You want to do the demo.
00:08:38.480 - 00:09:20.670, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. We're snap. So there's a bit of a problem, and that is, if you want to be a responsible investor and you've got a portfolio, it's probably in your best interest to rebalance every once in a while. And this is actually a bit of a problem when it comes to managing your portfolio in a decentralized manner. And as our good friend Thanos says, fun isn't something one considers when balancing their portfolio. But this is again, in reference to this particular product, but this does put a smile on my face. So, in order to counteract this problem, we built what are known as Snap funds, which operate on the Snap oh, double, double click.
00:09:20.670 - 00:09:41.468, Speaker B: Operate on the Snap protocol. Yeah. There we go. What we do is we allow a user to select a basket of, ERC, 20 tokens, select a rebalancing period, top it up with some Ether, and then away it goes. It'll automatically rebalance whenever that period rolls around. So, yeah, pass along to Chris.
00:09:41.564 - 00:10:22.768, Speaker E: So I can think of no better way to show this functionality than with a demo. So UX in decentralized apps is really hard. So we try to make it friendly and sort of guide the user through this process by explaining what's going on, what you need to do and the whole way along, telling every step of the way what needs to happen. So we're going to create a little fund here, specify how often we want the fund to rebalance and what we want the starting value to be in ether definitely shouldn't be negative, that wouldn't make sense. And we're going to make a name for the fund. And now we can go and add some tokens so we can filter by price, by symbol market cap. Sounds like a good thing to do.
00:10:22.768 - 00:11:02.204, Speaker E: So let's filter by some bitcoin, some ETH. We got to add some dai in this mix as well. And we got the latest prices here for each of these tokens and we can go and say what ratios we want for each of these tokens. And we can see, obviously, the outstanding balance is shown in this little gray bar here. And we can go and build up the fund based on what we really feel is important ratios to have in this fund. Maybe we don't want GNT tokens and then we can go and actually create a fund and deploy it to the blockchain. And at this point, this fund will be created and we can at any point in time, choose to top it up.
00:11:02.204 - 00:11:44.776, Speaker E: We can add new funds to it, take funds out of it. Afterwards, we can modify the ratios. The rebalancing period, I can switch across to rinkby if we want to deploy it. I'm on the main net right now because they have more tokens, so it makes the UX a little bit better. But I do have one fund that is deployed that we can take a look at, so we can see some information about that, the name of it, what assets are in it, when the next rebalancing period is and what the current value of that fund is. But this wouldn't really make sense unless we can really rationalize this kind of system and this design decision. So to this end, we made a back testing utility as well, which is open in this tab and where we can actually quantify and justify why this kind of process makes sense.
00:11:44.776 - 00:11:47.310, Speaker E: So I'm going to hand over to the man who made it.
00:11:49.600 - 00:13:05.350, Speaker C: Thanks for pointing out that I made it, because, as you see, the UX of this is much worse than the stuff that these guys built. But, yeah, it was very important for us to deep dive into the data and to actually validate that what we were building here does actually make sense. So we went and fetched price data for almost a year of ethereum and roughly ten, ERC, 20 tokens, and we deep dived into some serious data science. What we wanted to see is how these rebalancing methods actually perform in a backtesting method. And this all got translated into this small Python application that you see here that we intend to actually integrate with the much nicer looking web app that you just saw. So the idea here is that you essentially have a portfolio of potential tokens that you can choose from at this point, because this is a prototype. These are allocated all uniformly with the fund.
00:13:05.350 - 00:14:06.436, Speaker C: Across the fund that you add, there is this tab that lets you choose two different rebalancing methods that we actually tried. One is the one that is already implemented in the smart contracts that they just mentioned, which is essentially just periodically. So you can actually go and say, I want this to be balanced daily or weekly or monthly or whatever you actually want. And the second one is actually rebalancing by threshold. That is, if you have, let's say, four assets allocated in your portfolio and one of those actually deviates largely from it, then this gets rebalanced. So we snap it and we can have a look at how this performs. With the Huddle method, we dive deep even further to see what recommendations we can give of allocations of funds.
00:14:06.436 - 00:14:17.290, Speaker C: We're in a simulation of 50,000 random portfolios and these are the alternates for the maximum sharp ratio and the minimum volatility. Thank you very much.
00:14:22.060 - 00:14:28.380, Speaker A: Siri. Thanks so much, Team Snap. Next up is detok.
00:14:37.840 - 00:14:38.750, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:14:40.440 - 00:14:41.190, Speaker A: It.
00:14:53.350 - 00:15:43.650, Speaker B: Awesome. Hi. So I don't know if you guys know, but two days ago, 500 million people lost access to a live streaming app in India called TikTok. And so we set about to make a decentralized live streaming system that nobody could shut down. So we used Livepeer to handle the decentralized transcoding you can see here. And then we used Burner Wallet for the UI to make it very accessible and you could pre fund some token in order to access the stream. And then we used Raiden to handle the actual payments and tipping.
00:15:43.650 - 00:16:22.974, Speaker B: So as you can see here, you can interact with the UI and tip in Dai, and that's handled through Raiden. And then it continues to give you access to the stream. And then if you stop paying, then the bar is reduced and you will lose access to the stream. So yesterday we actually ran a proof of concept of it. I don't know if you were here, but at the back there, we had an electronic music artist who was here and he streamed worldwide through the platform. And then people were able to pay and tip through the Burner Wallet system. At that time, it was through XDI.
00:16:22.974 - 00:16:37.640, Speaker B: We switched to Raiden yesterday and he raised, I think, more than $200 actually, in people paying to access the stream. So, yeah, that's the system. Thank you.
00:16:49.390 - 00:16:55.450, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Team Detok. The next team to please come to the stage is Sebenzai.
00:18:07.970 - 00:18:09.040, Speaker B: Clip here.
00:18:20.530 - 00:19:09.502, Speaker D: Hello, everyone. We're team Sebanzai. This weekend was the first time we've built anything with ethereum, and Sebenza means work in Khosa and Zulu. And basically we're building a mobile platform that enables people in South Africa to make money on their phones and earn a sort of public resume that's been verified by doing data labeling tasks to train machine learning models. And suppose you want to do a voice to text system. Maybe it's an audio medical chat system where someone can speak to a doctor, but it's actually AI. There is no voice to text model for isit Khasa Swahili and this long tail of African languages.
00:19:09.502 - 00:19:45.734, Speaker D: And so we're hoping that Sebenzai can help give Africa a voice. And voice is just one example type, but it's what we built this weekend. So basically, you could take an hour of audio. And because there's no model, you could have a person listen to it and transcribe it and it would take them an hour. And you'd have to trust them with that audio because there might be private data in it and they're going to hear it. So you have to trust them. And so instead, one thing we can do is I'll show you what a worker sign up looks like quickly, and we'll do that in the background and then we'll create the job to do the transcription.
00:19:45.734 - 00:20:15.240, Speaker D: So the worker would normally do this on their phone, but we're just going to do this here. So what we'll do is we'll upload an audio and we'll digitally shred it into small pieces so that no one piece is longer than 5 seconds. And then there's no context, so you don't have to worry about some private data. And each piece will be shown to several workers because we can't trust one worker to give us the right answer. And the worker's skill is stored on Ethereum, so we do that by first giving them a test. So here's a hosa test.
00:20:17.610 - 00:20:26.758, Speaker B: Uziva Namsanji. Uzivanjan namsanji translates into how are you feeling today?
00:20:26.844 - 00:20:27.906, Speaker D: In English.
00:20:28.098 - 00:21:05.430, Speaker B: Can you all repeat that after me? Uzivanjani namsanji, the Ugunibo and anonyabilia nonke, which translates to, it's nice to see you all happy in English.
00:21:06.650 - 00:21:40.494, Speaker D: The worker does this test and we know the right answers, so we can calculate their skill and we store their skill on Ethereum. We'll go into a little bit more detail on that later. But one thing about it is we're verifying their skill. And so as they do tasks, that skill goes up and down because we show each task to several workers and we do a sort of skill weighted consensus to get the right answer. We do quadratic voting on the skill, but we'll go into some more detail. What's happening here is we've uploaded an audio file. So the ten second audio file is going to be digitally shredded into maximum five second pieces.
00:21:40.494 - 00:21:42.020, Speaker D: And the audio file says.
00:21:44.630 - 00:21:58.070, Speaker B: Singh jenga Sikobo. So Putula Ubuntu, which translates to we can use technology as a tool to uplift humanity in English.
00:22:00.810 - 00:22:45.302, Speaker D: And so the, the demo spirits are not as kind to us this time as the first time. So we'll pull up the video from earlier, we spun everything down and we're like, yes, we could finally go to sleep, but apparently we had to do this again. We've never built just go to the part of the audio after the video. After the you can mute the sound. So basically the ten second audio gets broken up into the color codes or the sections allocated to workers. And initially no workers have completed it. And then on their phones, people in the crowd when we did this earlier are typing in the answer, like listening to the audio typing in the answer.
00:22:45.302 - 00:23:06.960, Speaker D: Once we get all the answers for a little snippet, we run this skill weighted consensus to calculate skill. And we store their skill on a token. And once they've completed all the sections, fast forward to the end. So I might also tell you about the Ethereum piece and the way we store their skill. But once we have the confirmations and consensus, we then have the answer for that piece and we put it all together again.
00:23:07.890 - 00:24:18.130, Speaker G: Yeah, I've definitely been losing some easy cause transcription skills this morning from a lack of sleep. So what you can see here is basically we've implemented sort of a lightweight queryable skill token that stores basically the reputation of the worker on the blockchain. Ideally, in future we'd like to replace that with maybe like an, ERC, 1329 token or something else. But you can see, as the blockchain states adjust, you can see the skills before skill and after skill of the worker and that obviously affects the jobs he gets and his authority on what makes a correct answer. Something I should I just want to give a quick shout out also to the Open Zeppelin guys. We're coming from very little if it's a background and having their templates and building blocks and examples have been an amazingly useful tool to bootstrap and help us get up to speed quickly. You'll also see some the diet transfer events, it's firing from the state changes on the chain that was meant to be our treasury contract.
00:24:18.130 - 00:24:35.820, Speaker G: We had some issues with that this morning and I think that's partly why the demo now broke. So, yeah, ideally we would like to give our workers like, a stable coin to protect them from volatility in the crypto space because this can become quite a valuable income for them.
00:24:36.270 - 00:25:05.060, Speaker D: Yeah, and I mean, some of the other teams mentioned that there's 24% unemployment in South Africa and so we can create jobs where people can use their phones to earn bits of money. And so far we've been playing with ideas of paying them in airtime, but I think Dai would be much better. We just need a little bit more than a weekend to get everything working. But, yeah, I mean, hopefully you could all sign up and help us give Africa a voice and create jobs while building machine learning systems. Thank you.
00:25:19.900 - 00:26:11.396, Speaker A: Thank you, Sebenzai. Yeah. And just another all around special congratulations and a really well done to the top four teams. You guys have done really incredible week, this work this weekend. And yeah, round of applause to you all again. So, coming up next, our sponsors would also like to come up and give out some special mention awards or some special awards based on teams that built on their products. So I was hoping I could call up now a new cipher to the stage if Justin cooling, get another musical interlude.
00:26:11.588 - 00:26:14.136, Speaker H: I don't know, it'd be almost weird at this point not to have some.
00:26:14.158 - 00:26:15.240, Speaker B: Kind of an instrument.
00:26:21.180 - 00:26:22.410, Speaker H: Test check.
00:26:24.700 - 00:26:25.184, Speaker A: You.
00:26:25.262 - 00:26:25.890, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:33.860 - 00:27:45.332, Speaker H: So sometimes when at a hackathon, when there is not a particular submission with a first order privacy focus or a first order focus on developing cryptographic primitives into a usable application in line with our mission statement of privacy, as a human right. We decide instead to distribute our awards among projects that have sort of a generally interesting cryptology, which I think is the right thing to do for layer two applications. So if you are working on a layer two application, you find yourself sponsoring an ETH global event in the future and you're in a similar scenario. I think that that's the best way to support the community. So I have chosen eight such submissions and our $3,000 prize will be divided equally among these eight. And I will just run down them really quick and for some of them, give the sort of weird little angle that I thought new cipher, or more generally cryptological development might be an interesting fit. So these are devote.
00:27:45.332 - 00:28:22.020, Speaker H: Of course, with Devote, we may want deliberation or private voting in some sense, or batch private voting. Wild cards, maybe. We have like if you own the card that the animal belongs to, only you can see its GPS location so you could defend your animal. You could automate this. Although I almost didn't pick wild cards because they cast me as a baby rhinoceros, which I thought was OD. But then I realized that means I have a lifetime of rhinocero ahead of me, which sounds kind of fun. Dow versus dow.
00:28:22.020 - 00:29:08.150, Speaker H: All the weird little in game components there can be interestingly shared among their Dow participants in secret detok, mostly because it was just awesomely groovy. But you could imagine comments Section discussion section there snap folks are so friendly and I love that thing. Sebenza the use cases there I think are probably pretty obvious once you get around to it. Leak ox. This thing was awesome and you all were like working on implementing new cipher until the last second, but I'm sure you'll get there. We've always wanted some cool way to do like a decentralized secure drop. And then last but not least, Snake Nation Colony, mostly because I think it's pretty gutsy to demo a colony app at an ETH Global event.
00:29:08.150 - 00:29:42.828, Speaker H: Thanks so much. This has been, of course, a wonderful event. Look forward to seeing you at Future ETH Global and other future ETH events. We will be at ETH New York and we will also be offering a prize there. We also have ongoing remote hackathons. It's easy to lose track of them, but we have at least one remote hackathon that's going on right now and I believe there's another one starting pretty soon, like mid May, like in three weeks or something. So again, discord newscypher.com.
00:29:42.828 - 00:30:01.190, Speaker H: We do have a channel just dedicated to hackathon logistics, so you can go in there if you want to continue hacking. Look forward to seeing you all later today. I hope you all have a beautiful day, a beautiful evening, good amount of hydration, and a beautiful time hacking on whatever you may hack next.
00:30:04.760 - 00:30:21.290, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Justin. No, thank huge thank you to New Cypher again for being one of the sponsors for the event. I'd like to bring up to the stage now the Maker team.
00:30:27.640 - 00:31:06.640, Speaker B: Thank you everyone. We saw a lot of great hacks. I think 13 teams integrated dai or attempted to integrate dai and I thought four of them did a really excellent job. Two of them were already up on the stage, detok and Sebenzai just really quality hacks. And you guys did awesome. Integrating Dai and the two USSD projects we thought have a lot of potential in growing Dai usage around Africa. And so USSD for all and Lit Bits, USSD will also split all them will split the 3000 die prize equally.
00:31:06.640 - 00:31:10.960, Speaker B: Thank you. That's all.
00:31:11.030 - 00:31:11.680, Speaker E: Cheers.
00:31:14.820 - 00:31:28.840, Speaker A: Thank you, Sean. And yeah, thank you as well to Maker for being a wonderful sponsor of this event as well. Next to the stage, I'd like to call up Jacob from Raiden.
00:31:33.740 - 00:32:17.724, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. This has been an amazing weekend. And for Raiden, I think we've had seven or eight teams hacking on Raiden and some other teams showing interest, which is awesome for us. But three projects were really, really amazing and really utilized Raiden in a very cool way. And of these three projects, the winner will be YouTube, because they had an amazing demo and came a very far away in very short time. So they're the winners. But since we like the two other projects so much, we wrote back to the mothership in Europe and are currently working on seeing if we can find some other prize for the two other projects, which is Fairspot and also Detox.
00:32:17.724 - 00:32:23.290, Speaker B: Not Detox. Detox. So, yeah, thank you very much for an awesome week.
00:32:27.180 - 00:32:38.380, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Jacob. All right, so I'd like to just call to the stage now, kartik and Andrew to the stage, if you guys would like to just come up for ETH Global.
00:32:39.840 - 00:32:51.360, Speaker B: Thank you. Well, yeah. So do you want to take that?
00:32:51.510 - 00:33:26.584, Speaker F: I'll take that. So everybody, thank you so much for kind of being patient with all of us. We tried a lot of new formats and a lot of new things at this event. And we're super grateful that we're all here and about to sort of wrap the weekend. I wanted to start off by thanking our sponsors who kind of make the event possible without their support and kind of everything that they bring from mentors to kind of being there late night to feeding us stuff last minute and making everybody's nights. This would not be possible without their support. So I want to start off by thanking new cipher.
00:33:26.584 - 00:34:01.748, Speaker F: Thank you so much for being a sponsor to Cape Town. Thanks again to Maker and Raiden ENS Eco BrainBot, Taurus and UNICEF. Thank you so much for supporting this event. This would not be possible without you. Also want to kind of give a special shout out to some of our seasoned partners who have kind of supported us throughout the year for all the events Ethgob was going to do. And these are companies like Scale, Zero, X, UNICEF again, Thundercore and Consensus. And especially for this weekend, ETH Cape Town, our event partners, Ethereum Foundation and Linum Labs.
00:34:01.748 - 00:34:17.820, Speaker F: Without their support, we would definitely not have been able to make this weekend work and make it a fun weekend for all of you. Thank you so much. I'm going to hand this off to Andrew for a handful of more thanks before we kind of wrap up the evening.
00:34:18.240 - 00:34:45.732, Speaker B: Thank you, Kartik. Yeah. I just want to run through, on behalf of the entire ETH Global team, some special acknowledgments for putting this event together. There's a million different details that go into putting this event together. And we started planning with the Linum Labs team gosh. I think the first calls were last year, almost a year ago. There's so many late night calls and so many details to take care of to make an event like this happen.
00:34:45.732 - 00:35:09.228, Speaker B: And every step of the way, Linum Labs team has just been awesome to work with. They made so much of this happen. So it's a huge thanks. I want to thank each of them individually. Devin, emily, mikhail, nicole, megan, wayne, paul, veronica, ben, michael, kent, milani, florian, lisa, ryan, and tyler. And of course, Paul. Thank you so much.
00:35:09.228 - 00:35:56.120, Speaker B: If you see them after the event, please thank them because they really made this happen. And then also, we want to acknowledge all the volunteers. There were over 30 volunteers who came, and I actually have some special thanks to Craig Shabier, Malifitsani, Ocita, and Thandele. They volunteered for the event, did an awesome job. So, please, a round of applause. And then, of course, for everyone who was involved, the speakers, the mentors, the sponsors, the judges, and the venue staff and the AV team and the food vendors and of course, all of the hackers. Let's give ourselves a huge round of applause.
00:35:56.120 - 00:35:57.150, Speaker B: Thank you, everyone.
00:36:01.440 - 00:36:46.168, Speaker F: And just to kind of wrap up what just happened this evening or this afternoon, we had 33 amazing submissions, and our six judges, anna, Andy, Devin, Griff, Simon, and Vitalik kind of saw all these projects, and we presented them live to everybody else in the audience too. And they did the hard task of figuring out who the top four teams are. And you kind of saw those four teams go up on stage. But the question is, what do these finalists win? If you've kind of been to an E Global event before, you would know that these events are not competition. The goal is to actually encourage people to kind of try out the web3 stack and kind of play with a lot of what's out there and actually build something and continue building it after these weekends. So as a result, we want them to be very collaborative in nature. We want them to be very educational, and they're intentionally directed towards a lot of newcomers.
00:36:46.168 - 00:37:20.128, Speaker F: We saw four amazing teams come up on stage and kind of demo what they've done. And as they kind of mentioned in their own demos, so many of them had not worked on a lot of these technologies two days ago. So just being able to see what they did over the past 36 hours has been amazing. So instead of kind of. Having a first 2nd 3rd winner. We actually want to say all four of these teams are our finalists and our winners. And as a result, the way we're going to do this is every team member will be given $250 worth of ETH or die as being part of the finalists.
00:37:20.128 - 00:38:00.720, Speaker F: So all these team members win $250 USD worth of ETH or die. And I want to congratulate all of them for making it throughout the weekend. Thank you so much. And on top of that, we'll also reach out to you with a special Kudos NFT token so you can actually brag about the special achievement as a winner and finalist for this event. And we'll kind of coordinate the delivery of this token via Gatecoin to you after this event. And same thing for all the other prizes for sponsors as well as our main prizes. And I kind of want to just summarize again.
00:38:00.720 - 00:38:54.484, Speaker F: ETHGlobal itself is an organization that helps run all these events around the world to encourage more people to get into this ecosystem. Last year alone, we ran six events and attracted a little bit over 4000 developers into our events, out of which 1000 of them had never done any smart contract or Web Three work. And they were kind of entered into the system as beginners and newcomers. So our goal is to actually increase the number of developers who are working on this stack and this is how we kind of see our own progress and we do events around different places. So I want to kind of just talk about two other events that are upcoming next on our schedule. The first one is Eat, New York, which is on May 17, the weekend of 17th to 19th. So about four weeks from now, if you're going to be around or if you are nearby or live in the city or would you like to travel, please do apply to the event as a hacker or a speaker or a sponsor and go to Ethneyork.com
00:38:54.484 - 00:39:41.108, Speaker F: to find out more. And this is in May and the next event after that is going to be ETH India which is going to be our biggest event in Asia for this year. And that's on the 2 August. And to find out more about ETH India, please go to Ethindia dot co to apply or kind of do the same thing for the rest of our events and to find out what else is going on this year for ETHGlobal. There's four more events that we have planned for the rest of the year. You can find out about all those on ETHGlobal Co where we have everything from the talks that we recorded this weekend to our mailing list where you can find out about what else is going on and also ways to get involved in being able to be part of these events. And finally, I know you've all just been waiting for me to stop talking and so you can enjoy and take anywhere from a nap to a food break.
00:39:41.108 - 00:40:25.712, Speaker F: I want to just remind everybody that three minutes from now we're going to wrap this up and we have our after party proudly sponsored by Eku at the Great Africa Cafe and beach, which is just down the street. So if you exit from this venue and take a right, you'll see it in front of you and we'll be kind of heading over there right after this. So there's free drinks and food and we're going to go on later in the evening. And with that, I want to wrap up eat Cape Town for the weekend. Thank you so much. And before we all leave, I got one quick request for all of us. What we're going to do is we're going to clear these tables and we're going to invite everybody on stage and also on the first kind of here, and we'll just take a group photo of all of us that attended this event.
00:40:25.712 - 00:40:34.690, Speaker F: So just kind of everybody make your way out to the stage as well as kind of here, and we'll just take a massive happy photo of all of us. Thank you so much.
