00:00:06.170 - 00:00:47.562, Speaker A: I am super excited to welcome and kind of start this panel. We're going to talk about web3 native business opportunities. There's a lot of stuff that we've already talked about that is possible with this new business ideas to just new ways to think about using these protocols or just various protocols together. But what we want to do is focus on the ability to honestly just think about what is a on chain company look like or the future of managing businesses on chain look like. So for this amazing panel, I have four amazing panelists. I have Christoph from Request Network, turun from Coinshift, Julian from Unlock Protocol, and Mike from Superfluid. So we'll bring them all on stage and get started.
00:00:47.562 - 00:00:52.342, Speaker A: So welcome everybody. Good to see a lot of familiar faces.
00:00:52.486 - 00:00:53.180, Speaker B: Hello.
00:00:53.950 - 00:01:11.730, Speaker A: And before we dig in, I'm going to do the very boring thing which is I'll have each of you introduce yourself just so that for the audience who doesn't know what you are doing, they get some context. So maybe starting with Mike, we'd love to know who you are, what you do, and then we'll just go next with Julian. Krista.
00:01:12.310 - 00:01:34.380, Speaker C: Thank you, Kartik. It's a pleasure to see again after all this time working with It Global. I'm Mike or Mikhaile. I am one of the co founders of Superfluid. I had the pleasure to meet Francesco and meow my co founders almost two years ago now and know this kind of platform that allows value to be transferred in real time on chain and with EVM network so far.
00:01:36.910 - 00:01:38.870, Speaker A: Amazing. Julian.
00:01:39.030 - 00:01:57.810, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Julian. I'm the C founder at Unlock, a company that's trying to build or that actually has built a protocol for memberships. An easy way for creators, brands, communities of any kind to mint their own membership contract and then sell NFTs in the form of membership cards. And these NFTs have an expiration date which enables recurring revenues for businesses and creators.
00:01:59.670 - 00:02:13.000, Speaker E: So hey everyone, pretty excited to be here. I'm Tarun, founder and CEO of Coinshift. So we simplify crypto energy management for Dows and web3 companies. So started out last year and yeah, I think pretty excited to be here.
00:02:13.850 - 00:02:32.080, Speaker B: And my turn. Hello everyone. Christopher Flesh. I'm an ex CFO and I'm CEO and co founder at Request finance. And basically Request finance is doing invoicing and payments in digital currencies and we have plans to launch a Superfood integration next month.
00:02:32.850 - 00:03:02.360, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, so it looks like some alpha has already been dropped. But we'll get started with our first kind of very obvious question, which is it's definitely a trick question, but do we see actually businesses happening on chain or is it just speculation and people just trading NFTs and putting money in DeFi and yield? I'll just kind of open it up. Anybody wants to take the first step? We'll kind of go in.
00:03:03.610 - 00:03:37.502, Speaker B: Yeah, I can start. Yes. The answer is yes. There is some business happening on chain. I think just for conscious there was like 80 million, but Tarunu speak about that for request finance we've processed invoices for more than 200 million so far and this is basically happening from our point of view for bill payments, expense reimbursements and salary payments. And basically the companies who are doing that kind of business, they are of three different types. The first one is crypto native companies and DAOs.
00:03:37.502 - 00:03:51.080, Speaker B: Second one is basically professional services like lawyers, marketing agencies, software development companies and the third one is more web two companies transitioning to Web Three.
00:03:53.770 - 00:03:57.160, Speaker A: Amazing. Anyone else want to add something to this?
00:03:58.510 - 00:04:44.440, Speaker E: Just to add on it and all the categories I think mentioned, definitely a lot of our users actually use request network as well. So it's a combination of invoicing, core payments, mass payouts, like a lot of things. So all the categories are definitely there and third party sort of reimbursements and all those things are really going on. So a lot of crypto native companies and the good trend is there are some companies which use us, they just want to accept payment from overseas, right? And they just want like a noncustodial kind of solution so that they have full control like how they should manage it. So they also are looking to really expand through on chain sort of payments and acceptance, right? So it's like a new sort of set of market which is coming.
00:04:44.970 - 00:05:16.530, Speaker D: I would even go further in the consumer world where we're also seeing we've unlocked a bunch of creators basically monetizing with their audience and their fans and people are paying to access their content or access their communities. One thing that I think some of you have experienced is tickets to conferences. A lot of Web Three events are now selling tickets through unlock and these are consumer people paying to access something. So yes, there is some business happening. Definitely I would defer to the other guys, Christophe and Tarun on the business side of things, but we're also seeing that on the consumer side of things, which is really exciting.
00:05:17.830 - 00:05:39.320, Speaker B: Yeah, and I would add even that what we are speaking about basically activities that is happening on chain for businesses are resilient operations. Meaning it's not really depending on the market direction. So whether there's a bull or bear market, it's fine, it's growing anyway. So I think I'm speaking for all of us.
00:05:44.250 - 00:06:42.240, Speaker C: What we have seen at Superflight is that last year or the years before, there was a lot more of this DeFi summer vibes or NFT speculation. But as the teams that operate in this industry start to grow and get funded and start building essential pieces of the infrastructure that powers all these services, well guess what? They have to pay salaries and raise invoices and you have B two B, value transfer, but also B two C, value transfer. So it's interesting to look at the blockchain industry as something that is also robust over time and not just as fragile as market price is. So I guess anyone here had experienced over the last year or so and it's good to kind of dive into that. I don't know if you guys have seen any trends in this direction. Like, have you seen more business happening on chain? Everyone's talking about is this the year of the Dow? Is this the year of on chain payments? What do you think about it?
00:06:43.810 - 00:07:17.560, Speaker B: That's a great question, but it's definitely the year where the builders are basically standing out and standing on top. So the big builders, exactly like you were saying, Michele, the ones the companies which have funding, whether it's a Dao, a crypto native company, or a startup from more the web two world. But what we are seeing is that even the web two companies, they transition to web3 for efficiency, like Tarun was saying earlier, and this is something that's going to stay for very long.
00:07:18.970 - 00:08:18.682, Speaker E: And I think what also happened is I think in the last sort of if we call this market a beer market, I would say in the last sort of beer, we were not having boom of really USDC or stable crypto coins, right? And all the VCs or investors have money majorly in BTC or EC. And that's why the companies were not able to raise specifically in a stable sort of form. And that is it is highly coupled the growth of robust infrastructure into the speculation or other things, right. But the last few years, it just highly decoupled from that. And that's why two people just come to eglobals like hackathon and they can raise money that was not happening before and they can raise in stables and they can literally run like a proper business on chain. And once that is exponentially growing, I think that is like a tremendous sort of movement in this sort of business on chain business, native operations. Right.
00:08:18.682 - 00:08:42.274, Speaker E: And obviously Dows is like, I would say, like a superset of all these things. Like you raise money and then you finally exit to the community. So there's like a next level thing to just addition to that. So I'll say like crypto startups, all web3 major institutions, even investors, all of these people are just now running businesses. They operate on top of crypto. So that is something like really good happened.
00:08:42.472 - 00:09:07.174, Speaker D: Yeah. And I mean, you all mentioned USDC and stable coins. To me, it's one of the major innovation, not from this year, obviously from, I would say, probably two or three years ago, that's finally starting to completely pyramid everything that we do in crypto. Like, most people deploying contracts with Unlock right now are actually using USDC as the base currency. They're not charging in ETH or any of the volatile cryptocurrency, even like Medic on polygon or others. They're charging in USDC. And so it's pretty clear that from a UX perspective.
00:09:07.174 - 00:09:29.630, Speaker D: The predominance of stable coins now is definitely a big unlock and has given businesses but also consumers a lot more confidence in terms of trading things because there's obviously the technology that you have to have to trust it, but also the currency that you're getting paid in or that you're paying in. And so seeing that is something massive and something that honestly is extremely, extremely bullish as a signal.
00:09:29.790 - 00:09:50.250, Speaker B: Yeah, totally agree. And I would add that I'm surprised that we don't see a big stablecoin that is not USD pegged, actually. So there are some other very big currencies in the world and so far a lot of businesses, even in Europe or in Asia, they are dealing with USDC. That's surprising.
00:09:50.590 - 00:10:35.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, this is already a great panel because my job is already reduced from asking questions or getting all of you to engage. So I'm glad here that I'm next 30 minutes. But I mean, if I'm just kind of understanding all this, right? I did start off with this was a trick question, right? The answer is obviously yes. And the answer here is what we're clearly seeing is that people are behaving like businesses on chain without actually needing a legal entity for lack of a better reduction. And that's kind of, first of all, just mind blowing because you can get to almost the same scale as a really successful company in tech or even any other part of non tech world and never even have to deal with largely the real world. And that just still blows my mind.
00:10:35.974 - 00:11:10.370, Speaker A: Maybe the question kind of I have is all of you have customers that are in that category of companies that are not necessarily legal entities. They're directly mostly on chain. Have you kind of observed any kind of obvious patterns? Like, are all of them just behaving like exact normal companies? Like yes, they have to do payroll, they have to manage accounts receivable and send invoices or send money. Is that just one to one? Are we seeing something better? Like maybe Turin seeing that for so many Dows? What's kind of been some highlights.
00:11:10.950 - 00:11:50.398, Speaker E: Yeah, I will say the needs, if you just compare from any company, the needs are somewhere similar, but the experience and the things they want is entirely different, I would say. So in short, if you're holding sort of lot of crypto assets and now you want to run like a payroll, right. What a traditional sort of system look like you can just rely on certain bank and then you just schedule payments and you can just do lot of things through the sort of simple database. Right. And you want the same operation in crypto. But if you just say we'll take the custody of the funds, then you want automation, they don't want it. Right.
00:11:50.398 - 00:12:54.530, Speaker E: So basically I think all the operations are very similar, but the infrastructure and companies like ours request and we need to build that infrastructure layer basically to support those operations because the fundamental layer is like self custody, right? You cannot just use the same sort of tools to provide the same experience. And now the question is how we can achieve the best experience plus building this ethos of right, delegation, trustless or permissionless kind of systems so that we can then once we combine this, this entire system is far more, I would say superior than what we have seen in the traditional sort of system, right? So that is the common pattern we see. So a lot of times we also try to apply certain principles because we have our banking app as well as a coinshift, right? And now we have as a coinshift, as a user, as a platform as well. A lot of times we compare what kind of experience we want, but not at the cost of taking the custody or taking the trustlessness from the user.
00:12:58.390 - 00:13:14.940, Speaker A: I was going to say, I guess to put you on the spot, Christoph, is that the same kind of set of values and kind of principles that matter when you're thinking about adding more features to request or how does that kind of change anything for you?
00:13:16.270 - 00:14:00.314, Speaker B: No, I'd say so basically how request finance works is you raise an invoice and you get paid on a wallet. But you can get paid on a wallet that is custodial or non custodial, you decide. And the one who is making the payment so far he's paying from a non custodial wallet. So right now the integration that we've got is for example, integration with Safe. But basically projects like Conshift seems super promising as well with an even better experience. So basically I would say I'm a bit agnostic whether most of the future users are going to do some self custody. But the way I'm thinking about it for myself is I would not do 100% of one or the other.
00:14:00.314 - 00:14:16.720, Speaker B: So basically, I don't know, like 50 50 or trust some custodial services a little bit and also trust the non custodial wallet which basically when you trust the non custodial wallets you trust yourself.
00:14:18.530 - 00:15:02.800, Speaker A: Yes, which has some downsides because there is no centralized risk or a single point of failure in some scenarios with not a lot of but it's not a bad thing either. I mean we've kind of been successfully doing that at scale and it is in a way working for all of your customers to some degree. But I agree, maybe one follow up that I have for Tarun is essentially like you kind of commented on, there's some new infrastructure or just infrastructure in general that we need is kind of the goal. The way you think about it, that hey, we want to make the experience just one to one with how existing banking looks like for your customers or do you think there's more than that? What's kind of the missing infrastructure pieces here for you and how do you think about that?
00:15:03.570 - 00:15:31.574, Speaker E: Yeah, so the mix of definitely both things, there are certain things definitely you need to replicate as well. Like Invoicing is there where it's mandatory. Like you cannot miss invoicing, right. When you are building like a crypto banking layer. So this is there and then you have to have scheduling of payment. These are the certain things you can bring. But I think the interesting things which cannot be possible and people need it is like some kind of KPI based performance kind of things.
00:15:31.574 - 00:15:37.560, Speaker E: Right? And how will you really do that in a normal kind of database application? It is not that easy.
00:15:40.670 - 00:15:44.058, Speaker A: What do you mean by that? Can you share more? Yeah.
00:15:44.224 - 00:15:59.182, Speaker E: So let's say you want to reward certain contributors based on some KPIs, right? And it should be trustless for those contributors now, so you don't need to ask the admin like I need this payment at this time, so I'll perform this and I'll get the money.
00:15:59.236 - 00:15:59.502, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:59.556 - 00:16:02.318, Speaker E: So it's a trustless system which is not possible.
00:16:02.404 - 00:16:02.846, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:02.948 - 00:16:48.842, Speaker E: So I think those kind of new primitives will be there. So I think we'll be building more kind of those kind of primitives. And then there are certain things which is highly crypto native. So one example could be like right now I just feel like Multisec is highly operationally inefficient, right? It is built for security, it is built for securing your funds, but it is not built for running your transactions every single day. Right. So for that, I think what we need is more kind of modules on top of this base layer so that you can be operationally very efficient. And that is something like new kind of things you can do like scoping out certain call data operations, technically, right? Like this person can execute only these operations through Multiseg or some kind of delegation.
00:16:48.842 - 00:16:52.590, Speaker E: So these kind of modules will be required and it is entirely.
00:16:56.230 - 00:17:59.490, Speaker B: And to confirm what Tarun was saying no, I'd add that basically I think we're saying the same thing, but basically we can add workflows to how the money is sent to whom and even in which conditions. And basically the smart contract is allowing us to do that. So we could apply a smart contract together combined with superfried, for example, for streaming of payments, where basically there's total transparency and there is a trustless system for the workers, the builders, the creators, to get paid in a very transparent setup. So if I take an example in the web two industry, basically when the client pays and a sales guy gets a bonus, basically all this could be automated. If the client pays the bill, then the sales guys get a percentage. All this is automated, transparent, it's a clear workflow and it's managed by smart contract and this does not exist yet. But I think we are building the first pillars.
00:17:59.490 - 00:18:02.390, Speaker B: So step by step we are going to go there.
00:18:02.540 - 00:18:35.118, Speaker A: Amazing. I do want to give the other speakers a chance too. So what I'm hearing is I don't know, I just meant like there's a lot more that I think we can add on to this thing. So they're really interesting topics. So we're starting off with, okay, let's try to get the basic building blocks of running a business on chain up and going from what we already understand how any normal company would do. So you got stuff like invoicing, you got basic kind of payments, scheduling, managing payroll, and just kind of money flowing in and out. Those are simple building blocks that everybody needs.
00:18:35.118 - 00:19:00.278, Speaker A: And it's great that it's noncustodial, but also it's fun if sometimes it's custodial because you can have the best of both worlds on where the asset is coming from. That seems like usually the building blocks you need for running a normal business with a bank account and an illegal entity. Clearly there's a lot more we can do here. So maybe starting off with what you think, julian, what are some of these new pieces that we can add on and how do we kind of supercharge this?
00:19:00.364 - 00:20:01.578, Speaker D: Absolutely. What Christophe just said is very inspiring in that scenario because it means that when we think about companies on chain, we're very SKU morphic. We're really trying to apply the same model that we have when in mean if I'm a salesperson and I'm being paid by a company organization, but I'm also getting bonuses based on whether the customer is actually paying the company. And again with air quotes, why do I actually need to be an employee in that scenario? Is that something that maybe I am just a member of a Dow in that scenario? And so that's kind of pushing us further down the idea of kind of theory of the firm where basically the company exists as a way to reduce friction between different people inside and outside when actually the chain itself is the thing that actually reduces a lot of that friction. And right now if I'm a salesperson, I need to believe or need to trust that yes, the customer is going to pay the company and then the accounting inside the company is going to report that to the HR team that's going to pay me. Well, if this is all on chain, actually there's no need for me to get that information from the HR team. There is no need for the accounting team to actually report this thing.
00:20:01.578 - 00:20:27.460, Speaker D: I can as an employee be immediately paid when indeed the customer pays for the product. That's to me one of the things that I'm excited about is we're going to move beyond these kind of skumorphic phase where we're just rebuilding the same models of off chain companies and organizations to on chain and realizing that a lot of these is just craft that we don't need anymore. And so that's going to reduce friction and kind of make things much smoother and much easier down the line.
00:20:28.070 - 00:20:30.434, Speaker A: How does unlock fit into this equation.
00:20:30.482 - 00:21:05.914, Speaker D: For yeah, so the way, the way we think a lot about these things is like unlock itself is a protocol for memberships. And we think that many, many businesses eventually will have a membership. So in that framing, maybe we're more like a 2.5 model in that scenario where it's like we're still the same existing companies, the same media organization, the same creators, but they actually want to start thinking about, okay, what is it to have a membership as a core business model versus just a transactional one. So, for media businesses, that means that I get a membership and I access some of the content. I don't actually necessarily pay per article. I'm going to say pay in the form of ads per article.
00:21:05.914 - 00:21:56.434, Speaker D: Because the ad is a transactional thing where I pay with my eyeballs in that scenario, but I move into a different status where okay, now I'm a member of that organization. We also are chatting with a bunch of consumer goods product. We're thinking, you know what, it's very hard to do customer acquisition. But customer retention actually is something that can be improved a ton of times by having memberships as the core model. And so we all know that Amazon Prime is a very good example of this, where if you're a member of Amazon, you're more likely amazon prime, should I say you're more likely to actually use them to ship your next good because sunk cost system where you've already paid for the membership. Why would you go some other store to get free shipping? Because you get it from them right away. And we're discussing with some of the brands you might have seen that Starbucks in the US is going to do NFTs for their loyalty points.
00:21:56.434 - 00:22:00.766, Speaker D: That's a pretty obvious use case of the unlock protocol in that scenario.
00:22:00.878 - 00:22:10.180, Speaker A: Yeah, and also perfect example of what membership looks like in general. Right, and I think fundamentally, in a way, employment is a way to think about memberships. It's a.
00:22:12.310 - 00:22:28.182, Speaker D: You'Re seeing a bunch of DAOs actually use unlock for their memberships, where instead of being kind of how much you own of governance, you have one and you pay every month. And the fact that you become member of that committee gives you access to certain benefits and maybe the right to actually represent the company in kind of sales deals, for example. In that scenario.
00:22:28.326 - 00:22:45.220, Speaker A: Yeah, just similarly even benefits could be memberships. Right. Like you can get all these various perks even if you're employed in a different form or just directly on right, exactly. Right. Mike, can you think of anything else that we can use?
00:22:47.990 - 00:23:44.350, Speaker C: Well, quite a few actually. I love what you said, Julianne, about this idea of moving beyond the know phase of crypto where we try just to mimic what is existing in TradFi. We have seen that with every major transformational technology where people just try to replicate the existing world into the new technology standard. But I'm extremely excited to see what can be done natively on Web Three. Right, so there are some properties of the chain that are really powerful like transparency, custody, self custody, but also the kind of permanence or immutability and the fact that normally good chains should be uptime 100% so it never goes down. Right. And in this environment you can see how most of our operations that generate friction in the world we are living in can be deferred to the chain.
00:23:44.350 - 00:25:31.880, Speaker C: And in that case they are not only automated, but they're also taken care of independently from what the community or the organization or the company does. So you can envision services that are fully automated with very little friction or overhead that can provide outstanding value to the consumer or other businesses out there. That's what I'm extremely excited personally. But of course, looking at the world with a superfluid angle, I'm really excited about this idea of interconnecting economical players such that we remove these kind of delays that are really generating a lot of cost and friction for the world, right? So if you're thinking about this idea of payment failures or delays in payments in general, the world used to run on checks being sent out by mail, right? Now we have credit cards, we have a lot better infrastructure in the TradFi world. But what if you could just have a situation where a company can get all the value it generates from revenues in real time from their consumers or their clients in a way, and then redirect that to the suppliers almost as it comes in. So in that case, what happens is you can really reduce the amount of capital that you need in your own account, say, to then manage these delays to make sure you have the buffer to manage the cash flow. And that means that if you take the world economy and then you kind of reduce the buffer or the working capital needed to just make the company work across the board, can you imagine how much capital we can free up and put at work building better technologies for addressing things like climate change or those major problems you might be facing today? So that's what makes me tick with this idea of Web Three.
00:25:31.880 - 00:26:26.258, Speaker C: You can have someone paying a membership through unlock that goes to a business that operates maybe in a superfluid fashion so with superfluid streams in real time. And that value goes directly to someone working for that business that then is a collaborator that has been invoicing via request network or using the management payroll from the Con shift world and try to connect the dots such that the person has that money ready to invest in real time. Through, say, Ricochet Exchange, and that goes back into some sort of investment world eventually, or some LP position that then fuels the next company that's going to innovate. And then this cycle continues, over and over. So this idea that you can basically inflate the economic value of a state or an economy without adding more capital to the mix, just using the existing capital in a more efficient way really makes me excited.
00:26:26.434 - 00:26:44.400, Speaker A: Although that's amazing and I was going to just open this up for everybody else. There's clearly a lot of ways to do this thing in real time with just streaming payments and superfluid altogether. How do you kind of see this changes what you're doing at your core? Maybe go for it.
00:26:44.770 - 00:27:31.402, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think specifically what we're trying to build is the first layer as like core treasury layer, one kind of system. Right now the treasury infrastructure does not even exist. We're calling multisig wallet as a treasury sort of infrastructure. Right? So that infrastructure layer needs to exist. And then basically how we see this is any kind of core primitives to those treasury layer can be automated and then it can be run like real time. So payroll is one aspect, but we are very interested in things like where our employees are sort of getting the money and then they are just doing like a DCA on Ricochet, right? And then we are already doing that. Right.
00:27:31.402 - 00:28:17.660, Speaker E: So it is not like these are assumptions. People really want to do something like that. And that is something like we want to bring more these kind of primitives which can literally automate the entire workflows in a very crypto native way and superfluid just do that out of the box. And only what I would love to add on top of it is the entire experience of interacting with the current system is not that great right now. And we just want to make it really seamless so that from even the Dao and Min side or the delegate side, it should be super seamless to manage the flow rate, editing the flow rate or they can just come for the right operation. Otherwise, as Mike was saying, they shouldn't be worried about any other thing. Right.
00:28:17.660 - 00:28:51.990, Speaker E: The payment will flow themselves. So this is definitely we are looking and then on the asset management aspect as well, we want to move forward onto that as well, where you have certain kind of vaults where one wallet is sort of generating certain yield and that yield is redirected to the payroll vault directly. Right? And it is like harvesting directly. And when you are paying from that vault, you don't need to worry about I don't need to come back and do all those things. Right. It is like directly flowing. So all your treasury operations are automated.
00:28:55.450 - 00:29:16.430, Speaker B: Just an idea. Actually we did not speak about it, but I think there's no use case about paying a rent in streaming or maybe Mikhail, you're aware of that because actually that would really make sense. You. Get your salary in a stream way and you pay your rent in a stream way. That would be fun. Michele, are you aware of such a project?
00:29:16.580 - 00:30:09.182, Speaker C: Yeah, there's been a few and someone's doing it more like from a hackathon point of view and others are doing it more like a business. So what's interesting about it is that we manage to stream to an NFT so that if the NFT changes hands, the stream redirects automatically. So if the NFT, say, is your house or is a parcel of land in decentraland and you're renting that out to someone, the moment you sell that to someone else, the rent redirects automatically without you having to ask someone to send a stream to someone else and redirect the stream manually. Which is part of that automation we're discussing before where basically you are just delegating to the chain all the kind of business operations to some degree. So yeah, that is one of the key use cases for sure. And I'm really looking forward to seeing something like that happening, for example, in the B two C market as well. For example.
00:30:09.182 - 00:30:21.794, Speaker C: I don't know if Unlock has looked into this as well to have memberships on streams. I think we were talking about it and you and Francesco were talking about it as well. But that would be amazing to see. And yeah, I'm just looking forward.
00:30:21.832 - 00:31:09.550, Speaker D: I think there's an ongoing project of integrating the both where basically you're right. As long as you pay, you've got the membership and the minute the stream ends, the membership expires, basically, which I think is a very brilliant integration. I want to jump on that actually because one point that I think Terry made earlier is one of the core ideas of Web and Blockchain is the Web Three and Blockchain is Composability. It's the idea that these things could all work together kind of Lego bricks versus kind of the platform monolithic approach was like okay, you go rely on this thing for everything in your business. I think businesses have realized when it comes to kind of digital at this point, they're very reliant on a very small number of actors. Like if you sell goods online, well, you know what, your ads are all driven by Google and Facebook and then your shipping might actually power by Amazon. And these things are scary when it comes to doing businesses.
00:31:09.550 - 00:31:55.182, Speaker D: You really don't want to have this much reliance on a small number of actors. And one of the opportunities of Web Three in many ways is to actually say no, you don't have to rely on platforms like this. You can be using open protocol. Superfluid is a good example of this. And what's even beyond that is not only you can use these open protocols that would not be kind of rugged under your feet if things change, but also you can collectively manage them and co own them, which is kind of also kind of a very novel. Like, I know a lot of businesses that know selling things through Amazon or through Facebook really want to have a say on the product roadmap of these companies and say, no Facebook, this new kind of way you approach pages is not the right way. We're going to struggle with this at this point.
00:31:55.182 - 00:32:16.470, Speaker D: This is very much kind of impossible. Like basically every business that relies on these platforms, the mercy of these platforms, but with Web Three and protocols, not only they're using open things, decentralized things that are immutable or at least have a clear mutability path, but also they could collectively own them, which I think is even one step beyond and one step further.
00:32:18.250 - 00:33:11.226, Speaker A: Absolutely. I was going to say we're getting a couple of comments and questions from the audience too, so if you have any other questions for a speaker, please just type them in the chat and we'll be able to ask them here. No, it's a really good point too, because I feel like in addition to seeing in a way the basic building blocks being offered on chain, essentially what you're doing is you get to play with the granularity, right? Like if I want to send a wire or some deposit, there's usually a minimum required. When you do paychecks, they do every two weeks or every month. And you kind of now have a per second, if not even less than that, as a time interval. And you get to do a lot more creative things when you can actually do this thing by milliseconds or seconds or just any denomination that's as granular. And with blockchains, we already kind of got to the point where you can now send money up to like a billionth of a dollar, if not longer or more.
00:33:11.226 - 00:33:39.134, Speaker A: And that becomes more creative because now you have more service here to kind of do interesting things. And yeah, it will be amazing if your salary is streamed by the second. And same thing for a membership. If I have to commit to an annual membership for X dollars and I decide to stop it three days in or 99 days in, you can prorate that. And those are just not easy to do in reconciliation in traditional SaaS or any other model. And I think Superflow just makes that world amazing.
00:33:39.332 - 00:34:05.074, Speaker D: And beyond that, you can even automate what happens. I mean, the thing that I love about Superflow is I can automate things as businesses. Expiring cards is a nightmare for them. It's like, oh, fuck these guys. Now it's been like an hour on the phone to try to get them to update because they forgot about it. And at the same time, the fact that they forgot about it is kind of a cool thing because they paid without worrying too much. But now that they're going to remind them that we exist, are they going to stop paying? And so I know there's a ton of businesses for which kind of is a challenge.
00:34:05.074 - 00:34:15.440, Speaker D: But the fact that you can automate all of these things on training actually don't waste a dollar trying to call back customer. It's like hey, you stop paying, this is going to stop working for you is a massive, massive opportunity.
00:34:16.530 - 00:35:20.718, Speaker A: Absolutely. And one thing that kind of just stood out to me with what you said Mike before is one first of all, there's way more room to explore what new Web Three kind of building blocks are here for running in operations on chain. But even if you assume that there's nothing new to be invented, which is definitely not the case, there is still a massive opportunity to increase kind of anything from what you can capture in value to just the value you can generate for just existing building blocks. And kind of one obvious example which comes from a comment from the chat is the fact that all these things are composable, interconnected and inspectable on chain. You have so many new benefits that you don't get in the real world. Now, I can basically design, let's say, a tax management system that just understands everything that's going on. It can fully make sense of everything without me having to connect something or having a custom integration and you simply just get to expand the size of what you can achieve or how you can actually use that information for better decision making or just better efficiency.
00:35:20.718 - 00:35:41.640, Speaker A: And we haven't even seen that world yet and that's just even if you invent nothing new from here on, you can still have a massive improvement in existing processes. And I think that to me is probably the most exciting part, especially as we do a lot of logistics here on our end. Why would you not want that? And there's like 50 more things you can do on that one.
00:35:43.550 - 00:36:38.506, Speaker C: I don't think accountants will like me, or at least what I have to say now. But the fact that if you were to have visibility on the revenue streams of a business or even a consumer, that means you can pay tax in real time and that the amount you are going to pay tax is very transparent. So I can imagine how governments would love the opportunity to charge taxes in real time, for example, on a stream, so that part of your business operations are transferring directly into the government with the downside of them to have to be transparent as well in a way, right? So that makes it fairer for everybody. Now there's no real cheating, but then all the information is available and I guess the public can make better decision because of the visibility they get. So I mean, we can bring this to the kind of extreme, but we don't have to. The point is there is efficiency everywhere you look when you're using this type of infrastructure. And I think Web Three is just a matter of time.
00:36:38.506 - 00:36:40.880, Speaker C: It's going to just unlock it over time.
00:36:41.330 - 00:37:12.040, Speaker B: Yeah. The way I see it is it's super promising, but basically it's difficult to imagine that the authorities are going to set up this streaming tax system. But I see first some kind of solidarity tax system that would happen at more or less global level, just for certain causes that we could do on some transactions and voluntarily. And this is something that could happen tomorrow morning.
00:37:13.530 - 00:37:47.998, Speaker A: Yes. Since we've opened attacking on accountants, one piece here is that there are so many things that exist just because there's a lack of transparency. Right. The fact that I can generate anywhere from code to manage the most amount of cases, whether they're etiquette cases or just common conditions, to have a consistent system that just works across anywhere from jurisdictions to standards, you effectively can get to a point where these things are generated on their own and forget.
00:37:48.094 - 00:37:48.898, Speaker E: Even if you don't get to the.
00:37:48.904 - 00:38:22.966, Speaker A: Point where you're paying real time tax, I can foresee some friction on that one from some government sides, but the fact that you can still generate what it is automatically, even if it's real time or even if it's static, is still a massive improvement. That just is a painful process for every single company here. Once a year you got to figure out what transactions are happening on chain, what are interconnected, sort of swaps in there. You can fix this and sort of enable a whole new frictionalized, sort of more granular world. So I think that's to me already an improvement from this world.
00:38:23.088 - 00:38:42.500, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And the reason why accountants are actually preparing books, the reason why bookkeeping exists is so that we pay taxes. So basically, you know what I mean, accountants would not exist anymore with that kind of job, but would do some things which are probably a little bit more interesting.
00:38:43.510 - 00:39:31.540, Speaker A: You're right, this is interestingly. A perfect example of cutting out the middleman. Yeah, we've seen the finance side for existing systems. We've seen that on payment side and now there is the processing piece that is still incumbent. I know we're kind of getting close to our time on the panel, so maybe one thing that I think will be interesting to end on would be kind of seeing what you're excited about. Obviously all of you are working on open platforms and if you kind of can have anyone from requests to ideas for people to kind of build on top of what do you think is top of that list and what would you like to see more creative exploration on? I'll kind of maybe start with Julian because I think you have a lot of ideas on how memberships can actually be.
00:39:32.870 - 00:40:38.774, Speaker D: I mean, it's going to be a segue from what we discussed, but I think mentioned a couple of minutes ago, stablecoins as being one of major innovation. I think we're now at a point where we have all of these EVM chains and I think we're all building on these. I know the bridge topic is a contentious one, but I think it's also very hard for end users and businesses to at some point manage 5678 balances of tokens across different chains. And so thinking about a world that would be abstracting away some of the complexity of being on multiple EVM chains, where, as a user, I start a stream from one chain and I know the stream is going to go through a bridge onto something else. Wherever that something else is, is something that I'm really excited to see. I know there's a ton of teams that are working on this, but for me that's the next big unlock ha in the ecosystem. It's like, how can our protocol abstract away the complexity of a MultiChain world? I think it's going to be through protocol specific bridges rather than kind of agnostic bridges and hopefully we'll see that happening in the next few months.
00:40:38.774 - 00:40:44.060, Speaker D: And so if you guys are working on anything fun on that front, please reach out to us. We'd love to hear about this.
00:40:45.070 - 00:40:47.754, Speaker A: Amazing, true and dava. Anything you want to add?
00:40:47.952 - 00:41:24.242, Speaker E: I think 100% aligned with Julian. We just feel like our customer base is just setting up accounts on different chains for specific reasons. Maybe they're moving their protocol there. They have a lot of treasury assets there, right? And the most friction is like they can't between multiseg, like they can't between the money between multisegs in a very seamless way. It's very painful. So we are also sort of looking for these kind of solutions which can work out of the box and I think protocol based, sort of, right, efficient sort of bridges will make lot of sense for us. And front end like SARS can integrate in a very seamless.
00:41:24.242 - 00:42:02.210, Speaker E: So I'm pretty excited on that. But one other thing I'm pretty excited is definitely on the layer two, specifically on Ethereum. Because previously we all know other than Ethereum, it was very difficult to really trust any other sort of chain where you can just park some funds right, with the security of Ethereum. So I think the major DeFi is growing in the layer twos and that is something we are very excited about to grow. Maybe we'll build a protocol specifically on layer two, right? And just like Superfluid did that. So it is really appealing to us. Very excited.
00:42:02.870 - 00:42:06.082, Speaker A: No, absolutely. Christoph, I'll let you go next.
00:42:06.136 - 00:42:46.618, Speaker B: And then just in a few words, basically there are many innovative solutions, many opportunities of things that we can integrate and there are many other that we could create and that we don't have yet. But if we can have a next step, where the next tools and the next apps that we build are actually about execution, making them happen. So, for example, build on top of Superfriit, build on top of the great projects which already exist and make them happen and help the Web Two economy to convert to Web Three. That would be really nice and further innovation can happen a little bit later. That would be fine.
00:42:46.804 - 00:43:26.974, Speaker A: You're right. I think we've kind of essentially been talking about just how do we exist and just do everything in Web Three site. But there's a clear argument there's a much bigger world that we need to move to Web Three to be able to do these things efficiently on chain with new features. And that's a really good point that was missed. And I'm just kind of processing what Julian and Turin said. You're effectively talking about having different currency bank accounts, which is still a problem even in the real world side, even if it's the same asset, existing on different chain behaves like a secondary account in a different currency and you have different properties there that you have to deal with. And I don't think we saw that at all in the Web Two world or in the banking world.
00:43:26.974 - 00:43:43.060, Speaker A: So I actually am personally excited for that to just be solved where we just have an all in all solution that just doesn't let us spend any mental brain power on thinking about where it's coming from. We'll end with Mike. I'll let you kind of share your thoughts there too.
00:43:43.990 - 00:44:55.980, Speaker C: Yeah, I just wanted to say that what you just said is something that Tarun is addressing with this ability to manage multiple safe and also multiple networks with their new V Two. So that's very exciting and we want to try to use it as well, see how it works. For me, I'm really excited about all the building blocks needed to power a Web Three native economy coming together. So you've seen invoicing treasury management, membership management, subscription management. I think we just miss some of the understanding of how to manage crypto and putting some oil on the wheels to make sure that the mechanics are fine so we don't have to go crazy chasing sea level executives. Of a project to sign a multi SIG transaction every other day just to pay someone because they made a bounty and they deserve to be paid in time. Right? So these bits and pieces are coming along and even some of the back end infrastructure now needs to have high SLAs, right? And when the service level agreement reaches enterprise grade and there is no friction anymore, then we will reduce so much inefficiency that will unlock a lot of time for everybody.
00:44:55.980 - 00:45:23.140, Speaker C: More specifically, I'm excited about how real time value transfer would play on top of that once that's ready, because with automation, assuming that all the friction is removed by the chains and by the tools that we're building, then kind of real time finance would hypercharge all of that. So I'm very much looking forward to seeing how this could unfold over time with real time finance value transfer.
00:45:27.530 - 00:45:28.182, Speaker A: No problem.
00:45:28.236 - 00:45:28.662, Speaker E: At all.
00:45:28.716 - 00:45:32.310, Speaker A: It's like I am myself on one of the live streams.
00:45:32.650 - 00:45:33.400, Speaker D: Okay.
00:45:35.370 - 00:46:13.902, Speaker A: No, that makes total sense. And if anything, I think superfluous reduces that friction with, in a way, having a more optimistic we go ahead with that. And if something is not right, you get to sort of put a pause on that instead of taking anywhere from the full penalty to going through the decision if it needs to be reversed or stopped. So hopefully that was super informative for everybody else on the audience side. And if anything, I've just gotten more excited by running a whole company without having a legal entity. And I can't wait for more building blocks to exist so we can really think about that world just being our default. So thanks again, everybody, and looking forward.
00:46:13.902 - 00:46:16.278, Speaker A: Thank you in future events, too.
00:46:16.364 - 00:46:17.714, Speaker D: Thanks, everyone. Bye bye.
00:46:17.842 - 00:46:18.180, Speaker C: Thank you.
