00:15:16.200 - 00:15:17.088, Speaker B: Attention.
00:15:17.264 - 00:15:27.876, Speaker A: Attention everyone. We are now about to begin the opening ceremony. India, please come down to the main.
00:15:27.978 - 00:15:28.820, Speaker C: Stage.
00:20:57.320 - 00:21:40.630, Speaker D: In an ever changing world. Each day brings with it new frontiers to conquer, new possibilities, newer paradigms. And each time we're faced with two choices. To accept the tyranny of the unchanging, the barriers of the unimaginative. And accept as our faith any misfortune. Or we could face these hurdles head on. Shine light unto the darkest corners and find others on the same path as us.
00:21:40.630 - 00:21:45.326, Speaker D: And together build a world in our.
00:21:45.348 - 00:21:46.190, Speaker A: Image.
00:21:48.450 - 00:22:07.000, Speaker D: Where our collective vision makes way for the skies. Sowing the seeds of the future alongside bright minds. And as we choose to persist progress and prosper, we build gardens of our own.
00:22:21.490 - 00:22:27.434, Speaker A: How's everybody doing? Welcome everybody. My name is Kartik.
00:22:27.482 - 00:22:28.518, Speaker C: And I'm nishan.
00:22:28.634 - 00:22:40.120, Speaker A: We're super excited to welcome all of you to Eat India 2022. Nishant, it's been three years since I've seen you last. How have you been doing?
00:22:40.490 - 00:22:54.154, Speaker C: You know, Karthik just persevering through the winter with a warm water and a cold wallet. And Karthik, it's also like you mentioned, it's been three years since you came to India last. How is India treating you?
00:22:54.352 - 00:22:58.220, Speaker A: Well, my body doesn't know what time it is, but I feel amazing.
00:22:58.590 - 00:23:17.330, Speaker C: Well, for your information, it's 08:00 p.m.. And you know, Karthik, it's not in every event that you get a chance to wish the whole crowd good morning in the night and get away with it. So I'm going to go ahead and grab that opportunity and wish everyone GM. GM. GM. Welcome to Bangalore.
00:23:20.950 - 00:24:06.340, Speaker A: Most people don't know this, but we launched ETH Global by publishing a medium blog post on Valentine's Day in 2018. And we talked about our plans to go to the rest of the world and get people excited about Ethereum. Six days after, I got a cold email from a person named Shakti GOP saying there's a lot of people in Bangalore that are excited about this space and ETH Global should come and do an event. That was the single most hand, convincing cold email I'd ever received. And a few months later, we did the first ever ETH India in 2018. That event was 200 people. That was the entirety of that space in the Bangalore and the rest of the country.
00:24:06.340 - 00:24:14.946, Speaker A: And the year after, we came back and we got to 400 people and here we are standing in front of 2000.
00:24:15.128 - 00:24:48.270, Speaker C: 2000. That's a big number. It's really hard. It was really hard, at least for me, to imagine what it would be like to stand in front of 2000 people. So you know what I did? I imagined a group of 20 people and then multiplied that by 100. And imagining even that, just imagining that was less intimidating than actually standing here today. I haven't really been under one roof with 2000 people simultaneously, but I bet you have since you attended.
00:24:48.270 - 00:25:39.742, Speaker C: Karthik like you said, with the first ETH, India came the awareness of Web Three and ethereum into India. And people got to know about it. And you wouldn't know. But it was actually first time for me, too, during 18 year 2018, when I learned about the philosophy underlying Web Three, the philosophy of decentralization and trustlessness that you can truly create something for the people, something that's open source, transparent and more democratic than many democracies. And whatever I understood from that idea, I actually put in a t shirt that I designed a very few days ago before flying to East San Francisco.
00:25:39.806 - 00:25:44.742, Speaker A: In 2018, which back then was the biggest one we'd ever done. And here we are, twice as big.
00:25:44.796 - 00:26:11.406, Speaker C: Twice as big. And, yeah, here is the t shirt that I designed. It is very lovingly referred to by my friends and colleagues as the People T shirt and also as the Poople T shirt by some severely intelligent people. So, yeah. Karthik 2000. 2000 verified vetted and young Web Three engineers, the youngest among us tonight is just 14 years old.
00:26:11.508 - 00:26:12.254, Speaker A: Wow.
00:26:12.452 - 00:26:40.070, Speaker C: And as we have grown from 200 to 400 and then to 2000, web Three, like any other technology, has also grown through its stages. Starting from small rooms, then smaller offices, then bigger offices to hobbies homes and finally ready to take over the world. And I believe we are at that inflection point when we are ready to take over the world, everyone is watching us and we are making the moves. And if not, at that point, at least we are very close to it.
00:26:40.140 - 00:26:43.334, Speaker A: I definitely agree. Look at the 2000 people in front of you.
00:26:43.532 - 00:26:57.294, Speaker C: And at this stage, we love talking about numbers, don't we? Karthik we love talking about that there's a $2 trillion market cap. We love talking about the salaries in Web Three is $100,000 and $300,000 and all that.
00:26:57.332 - 00:26:57.726, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:57.828 - 00:27:34.362, Speaker C: Numbers have a beautiful way of abstracting complexity into simple trends like growth and fall and rise and decline, et cetera. Numbers are the most beautiful invention and a bedrock of our society and economy. But one of my favorite science fiction authors said that the only true way to achieve artistic wholeness is to create with one human in mind. And you might say that's a great quote, Nash, but that's for art. We here are makers of software. We make software. Is software art? And I would say that, yes, software is art.
00:27:34.362 - 00:28:23.976, Speaker C: And sometimes when software works well, it is more than art, it is magic. Unless we forget that the only species on this planet capable of experiencing magic and availing direct benefits of it are humans. And I think if we just keep talking about the numbers, we will forget about the people. And not only it's important that we keep the people that we are building for in mind. But it's also important that we keep in mind the people that built for us. And like Karthik mentioned, in most part, all of us being here tonight owe to one man, shakti GOP, the founder and CEO of Defolio. He's no longer among us.
00:28:23.976 - 00:28:57.764, Speaker C: And this is the last time that I'm ever going to say his full name, because he will always be Shakti Sir for me. Because in our college, we had this tradition of suffixing sir at the end of a senior's name. I don't know if it's still the case. Someone from the audience who was also in my college can clarify that. But I never called him sir just because of that reason. I call him that because he was my friend, my mentor, and possibly the only person outside of my immediate family to truly believe in my abilities. And I would have been really happy if it was just me he believed in.
00:28:57.764 - 00:30:01.688, Speaker C: But he believed in the potential of entire young India, the pulsating potential that dies if not given, a nurturing community, a nurturing environment and opportunities. And that has been our goal from the very first day since we started their Folio. The first seeds of this vision was sowed in 2015 when we organized the first version of In Out hackathon at our college. That was just 45 people in one room. And the journey from then till now has been absolutely intoxicating. Shakti sir was born in a small town of Jhasi and he studied MSC physics from NIT Surat, not by choice, but because at that time, this particular college had one of the best internet infrastructure of the entire country. And he really wanted to be there because back in 2011, having fast, unlimited internet could open so many doors of opportunity for you.
00:30:01.688 - 00:30:34.564, Speaker C: And so that is how he found a way to be there to apply for MSC and not go through the cutthroat engineering exams that plagued the country. Still, he always found a way in the true entrepreneurial sense. And I was also one of the participants of the first In Out, and I won the third prize there. And no doubt it changed the trajectory of my life from then. And it's just not my story. It's the story of many, many builders from India who have come in contact with Defolio, with Eat India and everything else that we do.
00:30:34.682 - 00:30:39.670, Speaker A: And we've seen that firsthand as people have come to us in the last two days sharing this.
00:30:41.740 - 00:31:24.944, Speaker C: And Shakti Sir was never fond of the limelight. You'd have never seen him. He was always sitting in the corner trying to put out fires, pushing everyone ahead of him and never really asking for attention. And he would have absolutely hated the idea of putting this big picture of his in front of 2000 and even more people. But just for once, if you can see, I wanted him to see all the people that he worked for. And I wanted you all to see the human that worked for you because it's all about people in the end. And this is possibly the most naive and nontechnical advice that you'll receive for the entire duration of this hackathon.
00:31:24.944 - 00:31:29.030, Speaker C: But as you are building, please don't forget about the people.
00:31:35.020 - 00:32:16.340, Speaker A: Shakti was a great man and a good friend and we owe a lot of this to him. It started with East India where we took this typical photo every year behind this backdrop, showcasing all the good things that we knew about it. This is 2018. This is us in 2019. And I can't wait to see what this weekend is going to look like. So with that, I'd love to get started with ETH India 2022. For those of you who are joining us for the first time, this is my typical line telling you all that this is not a conference.
00:32:16.340 - 00:32:54.320, Speaker A: This event is an ETH Global hackathon organized by ETH Global in participation and collaboration with Devfolio. And our mission is to bring in thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem. And this is why we focus on building. This is a hackathon. Everything here is about builders and this is a place for all of you to learn, mentor, get help and grow as individuals. And we really believe showing is way more important than telling. You won't see back to back talks here because our goal is about empowering you and increasing your skill sets.
00:32:54.320 - 00:33:31.324, Speaker A: And this brings us to the third ETH India ETH Global has done. This is Asia's biggest ethereum hackathon and officially ETH Global's biggest event ever. We have over 2000 people from 321 cities and 34 countries in the building today. On top of that, 44% of them are new to Web Three. This is an incredible amount of audience that is getting into this ecosystem. So please give them a big round of applause for taking the chance to build something that they're excited about. We put everybody on a map to see where they were coming from.
00:33:31.324 - 00:34:15.452, Speaker A: But the best part of it is that for the first time ever, we're going to zoom in and see the representation in India. This is incredible. And I can't wait to meet so many of you here and learn about what excites all of you. On top of that, we have 317 ecosystem mentors, 13 technical mentors who are here to answer all of your questions, and 27 workshops covering how all amazing protocols here work. And because this is not a conference, we're going to do just five talks. All the talks are going to happen tomorrow. We're going to have Jeremy talk about liquidity pools and DeFi infrastructure and how to take advantage of what's happening in this space.
00:34:15.452 - 00:35:10.030, Speaker A: Mooli is going to talk about how do we make our contracts secure and add formal verification. Sysmith is going to talk about pioneering RTC and making that more decentralized. And Juan Benet from portocol Labs is going to talk about how do we build and raise for Web three startups in 2023 with everything that's happening in this space. Now, I said five talks and there's only four here. So to reveal the surprise, we're going to have vitalik here tomorrow, joining in via Zoom, answering questions about the future of this ecosystem that's going to happen at 530 on this main stage. All talks are here, going to be where I'm standing right now, and we have $350,000 of prizes. We're going to give all of that away this weekend and we're going to go into all those details for all of you very soon.
00:35:10.030 - 00:35:45.124, Speaker A: I want to quickly shout out to the 45 incredible partners that have helped make this event possible. So to give them a big round of applause, I'm going to have all of you thank them with me. So I want to give a big shout out to Biconomy Polygon Questbook WorldCoin Push Protocol IPFS Filecoin, Ethereum Foundation, stackos Zkbop Covalent Come on, keep clapping. Cartesi connects infura etherspot eye hyperlane instadap. Lee fi dune live here. Mina powerloom valids the graph coin DCX gnosis chain lens moonbeam marlin NFT port. QuickNote router protocol.
00:35:45.124 - 00:36:26.390, Speaker A: Shardium start on eigenvice huddle one kronos AWS the daplace samudai hashtag and coinshift. All of these amazing people are here, excited to talk to all of you and they're giving away a lot of prizes and we're going to cover all of that soon. So before we go into all of this, I want to make sure we take the next 10 minutes to talk about how everything is set up this weekend. So let's go into what we're going to cover. We're going to talk about venue and activities, how you can get help for your projects, all the prizes, of course, all the workshops that are happening, how judging works, how team formation works. We also have an amazing Fireside chat here with you right after that. So before we go into all those logistics, a quick reminder to all of you about security.
00:36:26.390 - 00:37:00.060, Speaker A: Everybody must have their wristband and their Lanyards on them at all times. Because this is a 24/7 venue, we are going to tighten up the security at night. So if you do not have both of them on you, you will not be allowed to enter either of these buildings. Very simply, no wristband equals no entry. Do not try to cut this off because we will also not be reissuing a second one for you. So please, please keep your wristbands on. On top of that, this is a 24/7 access facility for the weekend, so do not leave your belongings unattended.
00:37:00.060 - 00:37:20.356, Speaker A: There is a cloak room, but there's a clear process for how you can keep your stuff there. If you lose something and you were not attentive about it, neither ETH Global nor Deffolio will be able to help you or be responsible for anything that you are going to misplace. Let's talk about venue and activities. Yeah, okay.
00:37:20.378 - 00:37:38.152, Speaker C: Let's talk about the anatomy of the venue. There are two halls. This is the new hall where you're sitting. It's got the main stage, it's got the hacking tables or the partner boots are here. The workshop rooms are here too. And the most important information of them all is the resting zones are here. But the resting zones in hall one are only for females.
00:37:38.152 - 00:38:05.940, Speaker C: The hall, the old hall where you did your check in has the resting zones for the males only. So again, females in the new hall and males resting zone in the old hall. We've got more hacking tables there and we've got games, food and judging all happening in the old hall. And you've already seen the snack area outside. And yes, they do accept crypto. No, I'm just kidding. It's all free, how much ever you can eat.
00:38:05.940 - 00:38:23.224, Speaker C: And then we are going to have activities. We have kite flying tomorrow right outside the venue, four to 06:00 p.m.. I suggest you join it, especially if you have not flown a kite before. It's really fun. And then we've got meditation happening tomorrow from six to 07:00 p.m.. A great way to take your mind off coding and relax for a bit.
00:38:23.422 - 00:39:00.790, Speaker A: Amazing. And let's talk about communication. All of you here should be on the Discord. That means if you're an accepted hacker or a partner or a mentor or a judge, all of you will have special permissions to see the channels that are only visible to ETH India attendees. You can go there. You'll know this because you'll see an ETH India sidebar section and you can do that by heading over to your hacker dashboard and connecting Discord. And this is where you can talk to all of our partners and get help on any of the prizes or protocols that you're trying to work with and just get those questions answered by everybody that's part of that team here.
00:39:00.790 - 00:39:42.720, Speaker A: And also, let's remember you're in person, you can talk to each other. Just go walk up to the booth if you have any questions or just shout if somebody knows something. And chances are you will get that help that you need. And all the official communication will also be on Discord. Which means that when Sunday comes up and we are doing judging anywhere from telling you if something is on schedule to where things are, to what things are not on track, or us even contacting some of the teams to be ready for some demos, we will be messaging all of you on Discord. So please make sure that you are actively monitoring Discord and everything else is on the website. The official source of truth is the website, which means whatever it says on the website is what we're going to be following.
00:39:42.720 - 00:40:20.956, Speaker A: So please keep an eye out on the website for all the details and for those of you who need a reminder on what the website is, it's Ethindia Co. All right, so the most common question we get is, how does this hackathon work and what can I do here and when can I start? Well, the good news is that you can start hacking on your projects now, and you can work with people of up to five on your team. You are also allowed to enable to work on your own. You don't have to have a team, so you can have anyone from one to five people submitting a project. You have 36 hours to hack, technically 36.5 hours, which is 09:00 A.m. Until the submission deadline.
00:40:20.956 - 00:40:57.508, Speaker A: And I'm going to talk about what all that means. And before I talk about how judging is set up and how submission works, a quick refresher on the rules. Everything that you are going to be submitting must be done from scratch. You cannot build on an existing project. You cannot add any features to something you've already done that would disqualify you from winning any prizes. And if you are not a confirmed hacker, which means that you do not show up on the dashboard, we will not be giving any prizes to a person that's not listed on a team or a confirmed hacker. So if you are working with somebody on a team, please make sure that every team member is in fact a confirmed hacker.
00:40:57.508 - 00:41:43.784, Speaker A: If you have any other questions, you can find me anybody on the Defolia team or send us a question on Discord or email. We'll be monitoring all those channels and answering those things for you. And there's amazing content that's available on demand for on the prizes page. All the workshops are live streamed and recorded, and everything is also happening here today and tomorrow. So if you missed out something or you're sleepy, you can just go to ETHGlobal TV and just watch all the videos on demand and catch up and pause and zoom in on the code or anything else you want to do. We're making sure that you don't get to miss anything because of any conflict. And for those of you who are still looking to form a team or looking for team members in workshop room one, which is right behind all of you here, we're going to be hosting a team building session right after I stopped talking, in an hour, from 930 to 1030.
00:41:43.784 - 00:42:05.260, Speaker A: And you get to meet other people who are also looking for other teammates or are looking to join a team and they have a particular skill set. So the submissions are due at 09:00 a.m on Sunday. This is how all of this works. At 09:00 A.m., you'll be required to submit all of your projects and give all the details. And then we will be doing two forms of judging.
00:42:05.260 - 00:42:40.940, Speaker A: There's going to be a main judging and a partner judging process. Both of them happen at the same time. In parallel starting from 09:30 A.m. And it goes until 12:30 p.m.. Once you submit a project, you will go to the other hall for the main judging. Once you get to that hall, you will be assigned a room number and you'll be presenting to our judges on what you built. After you're done, you get to come back here, find the partner and the sponsor that you are applying for a prize and go to that table and demo to them as well.
00:42:40.940 - 00:43:23.370, Speaker A: This means you have to figure out what is the right time for you to pick which one of these things you do first. If you are too late in the main judging process, you can go to the partners first and then come back to the main judging. Or if you are one of the first teams at 09:30 A.m. To go to the main judging process, you get to go that do first and then come back and do partner judging. You also have to do that for every partner. So if you picked on your prizes, three companies that you are applying for, you're going to have to demo three times to them and then one more time for the main judging. So make sure that you are accounting for this time because we have to judge hundreds of projects in that same window to make sure that we are dear to the same schedule because people have flights and travel plans that we cannot delay for.
00:43:23.370 - 00:44:15.508, Speaker A: How does that work? Everything will be given 7 minutes in total to demo, of which 4 minutes are going to be for your demo. You can do a live demo, of course, and we recommend the recorded demo of your project. So in case something goes wrong, whether it's the internet or a main net transaction, you can still just show how it's supposed to work and you don't lose all of the hard work that you've done. Really remind you to not do this last minute because this will take a lot of time, at least an hour. So make sure that you are writing yourselves and you can check out the project submission form and get all the things right and you rehearse some of your demos to really take the best advantage of the 4 minutes that you have. All these details are going to be on your dashboard and we'll also be sharing all this on discord. And of course, if you forget to specify that you're applying for a prize with one of our partners, there is no way that we would know that you wanted that prize.
00:44:15.508 - 00:44:49.540, Speaker A: So do not forget to select that button because we cannot know that you wanted to apply there. And if you go to them, they will have no record of you because they will not see your project on the list and that would complicate a lot of things for you and them. So make sure you check and triple check all the prizes you're going for. And just another reminder, you can go to the partners before or after the main judging. Just make sure you are coordinating all the parallel processes that you need to do. And lastly, I want to remind everybody of the code of conduct. The rules of being at this event are fairly straightforward.
00:44:49.540 - 00:45:35.030, Speaker A: In short, please be respectful to everybody else here. Harassment in any form will not be tolerated and we will take immediate action and kick you out if you are behaving inappropriately. In terms of the criteria, anything that you build here is going to be fully owned by you and you retain the full IP of all of your work. If you have any other questions or if you need any help or if you need to report anything, please message anybody on the ETH India team and we'll be on it immediately. So that's everything on the logistics. Now I want to invite a few of our amazing partners to kind of come in and tell us about the things that they're excited about. So without further ado, let's welcome Nikki from IPFS and Filecoin to share some thoughts on what they're building.
00:45:38.440 - 00:46:21.876, Speaker D: Hi everybody. Extremely excited to be here. This is my very first ETH India in person hackathon and I cannot wait to tell you about the Bounties that we are giving out at East India. So this time we are going to award Bounties for using Filecoin, filecoin Virtual Machine, Fem and also Buckleyao. So quickly, for those of you who don't know what IPFS is, it makes the web work. Peer to peer makes it robust and verifiable. Come find me at the booth if you want a two second 100 and 110.
00:46:21.876 - 00:47:18.304, Speaker D: 2nd 101 on how this happens. Filecoin is the biggest decentralized storage network and is built on top of IPFS. Filecoin Virtual Machine, the latest development in our ecosystem. It delivers on chain programmability to the Filecoin network, which means you can write smart contracts in solidity and deploy them on top of Filecoin and do Compute over it. Fevm is in testnet and we are excited for people to build new projects on top of it. This is the very first in person hackathon where FVM testnet is like ready to build on what all can you build? Practically everything. Datadows NFT projects, blending projects go wild.
00:47:18.304 - 00:47:56.716, Speaker D: Take a picture of the QR code over here to find all resources about FVM. There's mentors available round the clock on the sponsor channel. IPFS FalcoIn on eat Global Discord. So please either find us at the booth or post on the channel. There's somebody available 24 hours to answer your questions. Buckleyao is a network of open compute resources made available to serve any data processing workload. So this is distributed compute instead of it being in like a centralized single server.
00:47:56.716 - 00:48:26.750, Speaker D: This is also a very new project and we are very excited to see what comes in. Now what are the prizes we are giving away. We have two tracks. There's the storage wizard track. You can build anything using web3 storage, NFT storage or buckleyao and qualify for this track. The second is the FVM track. Build anything using Fevm, deploy it to Volaby testnet and you qualify for this track.
00:48:26.750 - 00:49:19.036, Speaker D: We have $10,000 in prizes for each of these tracks. It has top three winners, $2,000 each and ten pool prizes for each of these tracks. So totally 26 teams tend to win prizes. We have a lot of grants and other programs which you can apply to at a later stage. If two days hasn't been enough for you to explore all the technologies, look for mentors on the sponsors IPFS Falcon Channel, on ETH Global Discord. After the hackathon, the story never ends. If you're looking for ideas to build on, on FVM, the first QR code has a very long list of projects you could just pick, problem statements that you could just pick and start building on.
00:49:19.036 - 00:49:40.070, Speaker D: And all the other post hack opportunities can be found on the hackathon's website. Do go there and we have a booth and we'll always be there to answer any questions you have. Thank you very much. All of these resources are also posted on the Discord Channel. And good luck. Thank you.
00:49:41.080 - 00:49:47.700, Speaker A: Go give it to him. Thanks Nikki. Next up we have Sachin from Biconomy. Please give Sachin a big round of applause.
00:49:59.270 - 00:51:00.662, Speaker E: Hello everyone and thank you for the warm welcome and it's really great to see all of you showing up here. That shows how well the whole Web three developed community has growing. So if we just go back in time a bit and see how the whole past one year has been for us. There has been a lot of volatility you must have seen and you must have heard about stories of crypto crashes happening, centralized point of failures and people saying web3 is dead or web3 is over. But that's not why we are here today, right? We are here because we believe in Web Three and we are all heads down and building towards the future and building is all what we are here to do. So we are really proud to partner with ETH India as a sponsor, just to grow the whole Web Three developer community. And from the past events you must have learned till now the importance of self custody, right? And how important the decentralization is.
00:51:00.662 - 00:51:32.938, Speaker E: There's a saying decentralization doesn't matter until it does and it does now. But how do you build these application that has the self custody? And it's really hard to build these application and that's why for the past majority of this year we have been heads down building this developer toolkit which is called Biconomy SDK, that is solving the problems for developers to build these self custody application, but without compromising on the user experience and the decentralization and ownership.
00:51:33.114 - 00:51:33.566, Speaker A: So this.
00:51:33.588 - 00:52:13.226, Speaker E: Biconomy SDK. You can find solutions right from onboarding until engagement on an application. So you can find modules like Social Logins where you can log in your users using the social accounts. You can find solutions for fiat onboarding. And then on the engagement part, you can utilize gasless transactions, cross chain transactions, and even the transactions where user are paying gas fees in ERC 20 tokens. So all of these solutions from onboarding till engagement, all of them are packaged under one SDK, which is Pycony SDK. And we have three bounties worth $10,000.
00:52:13.226 - 00:52:38.920, Speaker E: You can just check the bounties on ETH India page and our booth is there. We are all here for the next two days just to help you out. If you have any problems, if you run into any queries, all our engineering team is here who have actually worked on the product. So they are the best person to help you out. And yeah, all the best to all the developers out there and all the hackers. And I wish you all the best. Thank you.
00:52:43.360 - 00:52:52.620, Speaker A: Thank you. Next up is Rahat from Polygon. Please give Rahad a big round of applause. Bangalore. What's?
00:52:56.000 - 00:53:45.112, Speaker B: That wasn't how did I say? What's up and what did you say? Bangalore, what's up? There we go. My name is Rahat. I am here to tell you a little bit about Polygon, though a lot of you probably don't need any introduction to it, but I'll do a little bit an intro here. We're polygon ethereum's internet of blockchains here at ETH India. Here to support all of you hackers, all of you builders out here, and a little bit about Polygon in case the 44% of you who are new to web3 polygon started off as scaling solution with this premier product, which was the Polygon blockchain built on something called a public plasma checkpoint nodes. And this was awesome. This was a great way to make building on Ethereum a lot more accessible to a lot more folks all around the world.
00:53:45.112 - 00:54:10.864, Speaker B: Since then, though, we have become what's called a Swiss Army knife of ethereum scaling. So it's not just the Polygon blockchain that you have now. We've got a whole suite of solutions that you can build with. Just a little while ago, I gave a workshop on Polygon ID. So if you want to go in, learn more about self sovereign identity, ZK proofs and all that, that's a workshop you can go back to. And how do you start building on Polygon?
00:54:10.912 - 00:54:11.316, Speaker A: Right?
00:54:11.418 - 00:54:43.824, Speaker B: The cool thing is, why do devs love polygon? All of the tools that you already use in the Ethereum Ecosystem map one to one right over to polygon. So we already have the best developer ecosystem in all of web3. That's all of you, that's everyone in the Ethereum Ecosystem. Your solidity tools, your JavaScript tools, all of the amazing tools that already exist are usable right off the bat. And we've got $20,000 in prizes for you today. So here are some of the Bounties. I'm just going to go through them really quick.
00:54:43.824 - 00:55:19.832, Speaker B: We have $4,000 available for best use of Polygon ID. Top four people, top four projects built on Polygon ID will be receiving $1,000 each. $4,000 for the best D five projects. Our DFI team has given some suggestions on different projects that you can build. So those are all available through the ETH India website. And $4,000 for best public goods and $4,000 for best UX. Actually did a UX workshop for a previous ETH Global hackathon.
00:55:19.832 - 00:55:52.488, Speaker B: So definitely check that out to understand what kind of UX we're actually looking for. And the final one is $4,000 for best developer tools or Dow tooling. So one thing to make sure that you do whenever you submit, make sure to include a link to a deployed contract in your README. This could be deployed on the Polygon Mumbai test network. It could be deployed on the Polygon mainnet. It could also be deployed on the ZKE EVM test network, which is available right now for you to deploy on. So thank.
00:55:52.488 - 00:55:59.752, Speaker B: Really, really excited to be building with you all through this weekend. I'll be available at the booth. So will the rest of the Polygon team.
00:55:59.806 - 00:56:15.260, Speaker A: Thanks. Amazing. Well, none of you should be strangers to Polygon and we'll talk a lot more about that. But up next, want to bring in Harsh and not richa from Brush Protocol?
00:56:15.920 - 00:56:16.700, Speaker F: Hey, everyone.
00:56:16.770 - 00:56:44.070, Speaker G: I'm Richa. Hey, hackers, what's up? So, yeah. As Karthik introduced, I am Harish, founder of Push Protocol. Let's talk about very quickly what we do. Awesome. So, yeah, we are going to talk about what, why and the bounties. And hopefully in under 2 minutes.
00:56:44.070 - 00:57:15.512, Speaker G: Let's get started. So, first of all, why? So if you look at web two, you will notice everything starts with a notification. Whenever you pull up your phone, you have notifications from app and that drives you, their users, back to them. Even when you're chatting on WhatsApp you're not chatting, you are actually notifying the other person. And that's how chat occur. Even if you're FaceTiming someone. Again, notifications.
00:57:15.512 - 00:57:56.984, Speaker G: But surprise, surprise, notification was not a reality on web3 before Push. And actually, fun fact, push was created and started from ETH Global 2020. How cool is that? Awesome. From then to now, we have 18 million notifications. We have over 100 plus integrations and notifications are flowing to 80,000 subscribers. These are some of our friends of Push and finally the Bounties. So, yeah, we have $6,000 for Push chat.
00:57:56.984 - 00:58:15.090, Speaker G: Anyone implementing Push chat gets that. Not anyone we have for 2nd 3rd prize. Same for push notifications. But yeah, we have a very special prize, $8,000 split among everyone that builds on Push. Thank you very much. Clap, guys.
00:58:16.420 - 00:58:31.780, Speaker A: Amazing. It's always amazing to see projects that were hackathon projects and they're now full blown protocols and companies in this space. All right, a couple more partners to go. I want to now invite Flywell to talk about WorldCoin. Please give him a big round of applause.
00:58:37.620 - 00:59:23.624, Speaker H: GM. GM everyone. I'm Flywell, I work at WorldCoin and I'm so excited to be here. It feels amazing to see all of you building today and we're so happy to be here. So to talk a little bit about what WorldCoin is, in case you don't know and you haven't seen this little thing called the Orph, WorldCoin started from the premise that crypto is awesome and unfortunately the value is being hoarded by 2% of the population. So what if Bitcoin would have started by giving one bitcoin to each person? Of course, this is not possible today with Bitcoin. So that's why we decided to create the WorldCoin Token.
00:59:23.624 - 01:00:16.290, Speaker H: So the WorldCoin Token is a limited supply token, 10 billion tokens, and every human on the planet can claim a free share of WorldCoin just because they're humans. Of course, the very quick problem we run into is how do we make sure that each person only claims their share once? And that's why we created World ID. So World ID is a privacy preserving proof of personhood protocol. It's enabled by the ORV. It enables civil resistance at scale. So it basically lets you prove that you're a real person that have never done something before, like voting, airdropped and Minting NFTs and bunch of other things. So think of actual democratic voting and things like that.
01:00:16.290 - 01:00:48.490, Speaker H: So this is a fully open protocol, fully decentralized. We're currently live on Polygon, Mainet, and you can start building right away. Go to WorldCoin. Orgindia. We have a bunch of prices, $20,000 up for graphs in different categories, including a price pool. So we want to get as many of you building on World idea as possible. And good luck to you all.
01:00:52.400 - 01:01:06.210, Speaker A: Thank you. Amazing. And one more to go. Please join me in welcoming Abhilash from Questbook. Got a fan base here, green one.
01:01:08.500 - 01:01:08.960, Speaker B: Hey.
01:01:09.030 - 01:01:30.884, Speaker I: Hello, everyone. I'm Abhilash. What is questbook? Questbook for all the devs here, I'm also a dev. Questbook is your best friend before the hackathon. After the hackathon, questbook helps you get grants. You can go to Questbook after this hackathon. You can apply for grants before the hackathon.
01:01:30.884 - 01:02:05.948, Speaker I: Also you can go check out before the next hackathon. So that's questbook. So we work with multiple protocols to run grant programs. So most of the grant programs, they're typically run by committees right now and they have whole bunch of problems. And we came up with a spec to fix those problems. So grant straws, they're typically run by committees and the committees typically do not have developers. So they have huge blind spots.
01:02:05.948 - 01:02:55.552, Speaker I: They don't even understand which developer tools are going to be important next and so on and so forth. So instead, what if we leverage the community of experts? And what if the grant's turnaround time is a week instead of like months? That is right now. And what if the grants are completely on chain full transparency and accountability. So we work with Polygon, our way Compound and a whole bunch of protocols to make grants process seamless. So right after this hackathon, you can go to Questbook and apply for a grant with any of the protocols. So just today we put out a proposal with Compound to disburse $1 million for builders. So this proposal just got approved today.
01:02:55.552 - 01:03:31.596, Speaker I: So, yeah, this $1 million is going to be given out in grants for developer tools, governance tools, multi chain strategy, and whole bunch of these things. So all this is public data, you can check it out. And once again, what is Questbook? Questbook is your best friend before hackathon after hackathon. If you want to continue building, come to Questbook, apply for a grant. Dows typically slow things down. It doesn't have to be that way. So we work with protocols so that devs can keep building.
01:03:31.596 - 01:03:39.570, Speaker I: So hit me up if you are interested in running effective community run grants program. Thank you.
01:03:41.220 - 01:04:11.096, Speaker A: Thank you. All right. Those were just some of our partners. And the next thing I want to do is use this opening ceremony as an opportunity to bring on somebody special in this space. We usually use this hour to talk about what all of us are excited about in the future. And today I'm excited to welcome Sandeep from Polygon. We're going to cover a lot of things about the future of the space.
01:04:11.096 - 01:04:20.424, Speaker A: India, Web Three and a man who needs no introduction, of course, here. Super honored to have the chance to share the stage with you. Welcome, Sandeep.
01:04:20.472 - 01:04:21.070, Speaker D: Thanks.
01:04:22.640 - 01:04:26.236, Speaker A: So we've known each other first of.
01:04:26.258 - 01:04:32.370, Speaker F: All, when I came here and I entered this hall, my first reaction was.
01:04:32.740 - 01:04:34.770, Speaker A: What the fuck did we do?
01:04:36.260 - 01:05:00.090, Speaker F: I was standing with the Dev polio, people Eat Global, as we were talking about like 2018 when we started and look where we are today. I was thinking like, even taking a pick and sending to Vitalik, let's see what we do because I met him in 2019 somewhere and I was saying that India is going to be the biggest ecosystem and all that and he's like, yeah, today, here we are.
01:05:00.940 - 01:05:25.570, Speaker A: I remember you in 2018, back when used to become Maddox, handing out t shirts to people at the Maddox booth. And here we are seeing an incredible progress and growth in the last four years. My first question to you is focusing on the personal side. Tell us about your personal journey into Web Three and how you got started.
01:05:27.320 - 01:06:38.164, Speaker F: Yeah, so I started back in the day in 2015, end of 2015 when I was doing my previous startup and it was B two B and it was not scaling as fast as ever thought. And I thought that I want to go into the deep tech space. And I had heard about Bitcoin back in 2013, but initially, like, that time, I thought that it did not just make sense to me, right? So then in 2016, and then when I first went into AI a little bit and then heard about Bitcoin again, I thought that what this thing is still alive. This is still around, like, what's going on here? So then I went into that Bitcoin white paper and all that, and I actually did not see it as money and changing the money. At that point in time, I had a good understanding of geopolitics and all that. And I realized that, okay, this makes sense. But what I saw as an engineer, I thought is that this is basically somebody built this decentralized network which is right now solving a small computation, small logic, which is payment logic.
01:06:38.164 - 01:07:10.144, Speaker F: You pay to me a minus B amount and B's balance goes up. And I thought at that time, what if we could do complex business logic in this kind of setting? That could be useful for a lot of things. And then I was on and off and all that. And then three, four weeks into this, I stumbled on Ethereum. And I think Ethereum then went from read the first line I read like generalized smart contracts and this. And I said, oh shit, this is big. And that is the time I took two weeks.
01:07:10.144 - 01:07:39.804, Speaker F: In two weeks, I sent a mail to all my clients. I said, guys, I'm shutting it down. I will still help you for next six months to make sure that it's transitioned out. But I am going all in into that. And I left. Everything went back to coming from my background, where I come from, going back to zero money making, where I am the one putting the food on the table for my whole family, parents, everyone. It was a hard choice, but I think that it was very clear that this is going to be very big.
01:07:39.804 - 01:07:40.668, Speaker F: And here we are.
01:07:40.754 - 01:07:51.250, Speaker A: That's a lot of conviction, especially back then. What was the ecosystem like in India and kind of could you share more on how hard or easy or hard things were?
01:07:51.780 - 01:08:04.416, Speaker F: Yeah, I think at that point in time, it was only initially some crypto trading communities. Like there was almost zero development communities. There were one or two researchers.
01:08:04.528 - 01:08:05.908, Speaker A: What year are we talking here?
01:08:05.994 - 01:08:25.596, Speaker F: This year we are talking about 2017 early also. Like mid 2016 or early. That was very early for Ethereum also. Right, but even 2017 early. There was nobody even till 2017. And there were few developers who are working for future foreign companies. And then we started in early 2018.
01:08:25.596 - 01:08:52.908, Speaker F: And first time we received, we heard that ETH India is happening in this one. And we interacted with my brother, like Shakti, who's not here now, but what a man. And we interacted and we said that this is absolutely needed over there. And then when we were starting, we initially were thinking that we will get probably 100 people registering and things like that. Like, just that low.
01:08:53.094 - 01:08:54.836, Speaker A: We thought that too, at that point.
01:08:54.938 - 01:09:19.176, Speaker F: But the good part was you said 44% were people were new in Web Three that time. I think 100% were new to Web Three. But yeah, here we are. I think you guys have done amazing job globally and in India. Shout out to Dev Polio team. After all of these problems and all that, striving hard to build this dev community in India. Organic Dev community in India.
01:09:19.176 - 01:09:57.816, Speaker F: And actually, if you can give me one or two more minutes, I wanted to share. When we saw Shakti over there, even the Dev Polio team was here. And we all got emotional looking at Shakti. And that's the spirit of I think India's web3 ecosystem. Also back in the day when after ETH Global, also 2018, then there was a big bear market and all that. Nobody would give money for hackathons and things like that. And I and Shakti would have lot of these discussions that Shakti is like, I don't have enough runway for next three, four months and all that.
01:09:57.816 - 01:10:35.524, Speaker F: And we would say, okay, let's keep trying. Even we were very small. We never got any VC funding and all that, right? So sometimes like $10,000, $20,000, these kind of grants, that, okay, let's keep pushing, let's keep pushing. Let's keep trying more. And then after all this bear market and all that, after 2019, East India, then came this COVID slump, right? Like, absolutely everything got destroyed. And I remember that after second or third day after the lockdown, I and Shakti were discussing, and it looked like even for polygon, things were tight, right? But then again, we said, that okay, bro, let's try more time. Let's try it some more time.
01:10:35.524 - 01:11:03.644, Speaker F: Let's try some more time. We started like Dev Folio team switched into online hackathons completely. And then we started doing monthly hackathons and all that. And then Shakti and I were speaking, let's say. And then he says that I have some sort of fever tomorrow I can't join this call. And that was the time when he got COVID. And then he was in a tier three city in India, and there was no facility also in the hospital, no medicine coming in.
01:11:03.644 - 01:11:38.132, Speaker F: I started that crypto leaf fund, right? And we worked very hard, like I, Akash and his team members and all that. And in the last few days, we even arranged a ventilator. Like, somebody traveled from India with a whole ventilator to the hospital. And he enters the hospital and they say that it's not needed, right? But one thing, like, I was very sad for multiple days, but one thing I am proud of, that we still tried really hard. And that's the spirit of Indian Web Three. We keep trying. And one day, we are going to make India a Web Three superpower.
01:11:38.132 - 01:11:39.416, Speaker F: Fucking superpower in web.
01:11:39.438 - 01:12:14.708, Speaker A: Three. We're going to dig a lot into that as far as stand part of the same story. And there's a lot that's happened in the last four years. And I think the thing to remember is that we came out strong and united and bigger than we were even a year ago and that's what we should remember. I do want to switch a bit of gears and kind of talk about how we see the future of this space. I want to ask a fairly blunt question. Polygon is not really a L2.
01:12:14.708 - 01:12:16.356, Speaker A: What do you say to that?
01:12:16.538 - 01:12:47.552, Speaker F: Yes. As we said, polygon is ethereum's. Internet of blockchains. We don't subscribe to this narrow definition of L2, which means that you have to keep all the data back on L2. You also need to have full security on L2 and everything. We believe that it is a spectrum. Even chains like Polygon, chains like Xdai, nosis chain, they all have added a lot of network effects into Ethereum as far as the communities are.
01:12:47.606 - 01:12:50.044, Speaker A: So maybe let's talk about how you're aligned with Ethereum.
01:12:50.172 - 01:14:01.300, Speaker F: Yes, so that's exactly why so we are like hardcore Ethereum community people and what we have done is if you see in the last whole 2020 and Karthik, we have been seeing 20, 21, 22, like this whole Elvin wars if you ask yourself who saved Ethereum from these Elvin wars? We were the ones who were fighting tooth and nail on the trenches against these. They completely run away into adoption and all that. But the thing being that we want to provide this Ethereum stack, the EVM stack to the developers in the range of decentralization. At the end, what we are doing at Polygon is we are providing decentralized compute on top of Ethereum. And that decentralized compute comes on a spectrum you can have. Like if you are a startup who has only 100 users right now, do you need Ethereum kind of security? You probably might be okay with having your own. Let's say you're working on a side chain which has like maybe if it's a dedicated chain, even two validators or if you are on a public chain you can have Polygon peers 100 validators and all that decent enough security for you.
01:14:01.300 - 01:14:45.076, Speaker F: But if as you keep growing across the cycle, you can actually be deployed on like Zkevm today, which has full Ethereum security and I think that is our commitment to Ethereum. We are the first in market, fully available source code available Zkevm, fully built out all features. And that also is my message to all of you guys. Test out Zkevm, like while all these bounties, I would say apply them on Zkevm instead of Mumbai testnet and all that and you will see the experience already we know like more than 2000 smart contracts have been deployed. The user experience is absolutely fabulous. And we have David, my co founder, who has built this ZKE EVM like product head there. He's there with you.
01:14:45.076 - 01:15:04.232, Speaker F: If you have any queries, ask with him. Ask from him. And that's our commitment to Ethereum. And you will see some of very big announcements from us which will show that what are our plans for Ethereum? Because that's the fun part about Ethereum. Ethereum is not only Vitalik's or Ethereum foundation network, it is your network. It is our network and we also have plans for Ethereum.
01:15:04.296 - 01:15:25.644, Speaker A: And you'll see that's wonderful. I'm looking forward to what these announcements are. Hopefully we get some alpha here. But obviously ZK everything is what the talk of the town is. Polygon has three ZK initiatives. Why do you have three? And kind of what's the thinking behind having these parallel approaches?
01:15:25.772 - 01:15:47.716, Speaker F: Yes, so ZK technology, especially when we were starting like one year back, it was such an early stage, although we have seen a hockey streak growth in Azik technology but it was such an early stage that even betting on one out of three four approaches available is very risky. And remember that we are coming from the burnt off hardburn of plasma.
01:15:47.748 - 01:15:50.616, Speaker A: Right, we remember plasma and we were.
01:15:50.638 - 01:16:17.484, Speaker F: The only team like nobody respects the fact that we were the only team which built a production ready plasma. Everybody just left it like it doesn't work and all that. No longer hyped up. So we are leaving. Right. So we built it fully but people ended up using the POS part more because it was easy to use. Now, we did not want to take first of all, it was very clear in our mind that we don't want to be stuck in one approach which fails eventually.
01:16:17.484 - 01:16:31.672, Speaker F: Right. So we were very clear. So that is one reason. Second reason is that L2, as we say layer one is for decentralization and security. Layer two is for experimentation where apps can experiment at scale with user experience and things like that.
01:16:31.726 - 01:16:36.760, Speaker A: Is that the same as compute to you or is there differentiation between experimentation and compute?
01:16:38.220 - 01:16:39.560, Speaker F: I didn't get the question.
01:16:39.710 - 01:16:45.768, Speaker A: So you said L2 is about experimentation. Is that the same as compute? Because you previously mentioned compute will be.
01:16:45.774 - 01:17:30.408, Speaker F: On layer yes, you have much more spectrum of compute. You will have cheaper compute and you will have costly but more secure compute and you can experiment with it like what kind of application you are building. Right. If you are building DFI, you probably need very heavily Ethereum secured capacity. But if you are building a game, a casual game where people are going to own $510 worth of NFTs then you are probably okay with less decentralized or not secured with Ethereum, but fairly decentralized, this thing. Right, but what I was saying is that about these three ZK solutions these three ZK solutions first two of them are working on EVM compatibility only, but they have the difference in approaches. But the third approach, and I don't want to disclose more over there.
01:17:30.408 - 01:17:58.930, Speaker F: But as I said that we have very strong plans for Ethereum and Ethereum's defensibility. So next time somebody comes to you and say that, hey, I have this L1 and I am supporting Rust, or I am supporting this programming language, that programming language, we will make sure that you will get all those programming languages, all those fancy programming constructs available on top of Ethereum. That's why these three different approaches and you are going to see some really fun stuff coming from us.
01:17:59.620 - 01:18:19.944, Speaker A: Hopefully you realize this thing. But you just announced something that you guys are working on. I'm not going to repeat it. You guys have to watch and pause the video after this to really read between the lines. That's incredible. So in a way, it's a good thing if all three approaches work and it's not just about increasing your ODS to see one of the three. Yes.
01:18:20.062 - 01:19:11.370, Speaker F: And also it was so early that out of these three approaches, that's why we were able to build this Zkevm in last probably eight months, where people are working for last four years. Why? Because we had this cross pollination of these ideas. And you might discuss this with David also that first what they were building at Hermes, borrowing a lot of ideas from Zero and MIDN, they were able to build it much faster, much more efficient and much more concise. Like we have some other ZK implementations which already are running into tens of thousands of lines of code, where we have like 4000 very crisp and efficiently written lines of code, which can be very easily, not easily, but they can be fairly audited. And we believe that this will be much more production ready, much faster than anybody else.
01:19:11.740 - 01:19:46.790, Speaker A: I mean, I can't wait for that because all the hackers get to try this out and break it apart. So you get to fix it after. I think a lot of what you just said so far is coming from the perspective of applying research and kind of making those things go to production. And that's great. But you're also at the same time talking about or talking to a lot of companies with partnerships, launches, getting more and more consumer applications into this space. Research stuff aside, what is the biggest problem that the polygon ecosystem is facing right now? Or rather what keeps you up at night?
01:19:47.240 - 01:21:07.884, Speaker F: Yeah, so I think with all of what has happened in the past few days or weeks, it's a good and the bad part both because last one year there has been war cry that we need to go mainstream, we are too niche. But I think with what all happened, the mainstream adoption will slightly become slightly slower. But then we have to go back to our roots with the niche community and build out and work more on these niche use cases. That's why I think this ETH Global hackathon, ETH India and other hackathons become very very relevant because here is where many kind of new ideas are going to be taking birth right and those ideas are going to become very relevant. That's why it's very important for you guys also to build differentiated products in DeFi in NFT and there is a very high possibility that you might get accelerated growth in some of those things because the focus has come back to these things. Instead of only being on the Instagram and Reddits and these big Starbucks of the world, the focus is back to the developer here and back to self custody and all those core fundamentals of web3. And that's why it's very relevant.
01:21:07.884 - 01:21:15.170, Speaker F: I hope that just like we have seen in the past ETH India, we'll see some big companies coming out from this.
01:21:15.700 - 01:21:25.316, Speaker A: I totally agree with that but I'm going to give you a hard time here. You didn't answer my question. What is the biggest problem polygon is facing? Sorry? Yes.
01:21:25.418 - 01:22:45.548, Speaker F: So one of the biggest problem is I want to see more innovation. Like that's what I said in this one also more innovation. It's not specific to polygon but I would say in India ecosystem also more innovative products coming out which have some sort of differentiated product offering, go to market offering and things like that, it's no longer relevant. Like if you guys come up like okay, I build an NFT marketplace or I build a lending borrowing system, no? What is the differentiation in your product? And also I want to give a message that across the overall this polygon connect yesterday like 2000 people were there and multiple events that old model of and especially relevant to web3 that you do a token and this token will do well and things like that, that does not work. Not only it is not recommended, it does not work now. If let's say you end up launching a token with a non differentiated product and all that and you are thinking that I'll get listed and this token will do like market dance and whatever I think first of all, it doesn't work now because the market does not have that kind of capital. We all had like 15 years of bull market infinite capital that is no longer relevant and also the community is much more scrutinizing for everything.
01:22:45.548 - 01:23:11.104, Speaker F: So when you want to do this, make sure you do it right, don't do it for the sake of it, for the heck of it and don't do it in a hassled way. Build a product, build a community and when the community and you see a real relevant value accrual, value capture for the token then only go for those token related things. Don't chase the token mania that is going to be harmful for your longer term journey.
01:23:11.152 - 01:23:22.616, Speaker A: And it's not just that it doesn't work. We know that factually because we've seen that from experience. Exactly. There's a lot of years of case studies. Here of proving this point?
01:23:22.798 - 01:23:44.704, Speaker F: No, actually, I learned also from you because I've been very focused on exponential ecosystem growth, and I think I have debated with you also multiple times. And I learned one thing always from you, whenever I met you all over the world, that you were always thinking of like, okay, right now it works, it's hyped up and all that. But you would be like, I don't see how it survives ten years from now, five years from now.
01:23:44.742 - 01:23:45.328, Speaker A: Right.
01:23:45.494 - 01:23:55.076, Speaker F: And I think that's why people like you who have made investments in those things, those would have survived. Large part of your investments would have survived. Otherwise, many of them got wiped out.
01:23:55.258 - 01:23:57.060, Speaker A: Only the paranoid survive.
01:23:57.480 - 01:24:17.148, Speaker F: Yeah, exactly. So I'm also trying to learn more from that. Even for the ecosystem, we want to support those applications, who we see that these are going to exist five years, ten years from now, and these are going to build sustainable business models, not only about this cash raise and funds and things like that.
01:24:17.234 - 01:24:51.160, Speaker A: This is an interesting theme, right there's. So many engineers here, so many developers here, and we're excited about just playing with the latest technologies, the latest frameworks, and we see interesting smart contract use cases as innovative for what we think Web Three can do. But it's way bigger than that. And we kind of touched on this thing. So I want to actually go back to something that you said earlier, which is the impact of crypto is not just in software. Let's talk about crypto relief. Tell us about what crypto relief was and what's happened in the last two and a half years.
01:24:51.310 - 01:24:54.410, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, crypto relief, for example.
01:24:55.420 - 01:24:56.712, Speaker A: Tell us how it started.
01:24:56.846 - 01:25:30.156, Speaker F: Yeah, so crypto relief started when my sister traveled to my place, and India was having this huge delta wave of COVID and all that, and everybody was left, right and center. Like, I was trying to volunteer for a few people, helping them with money, things like that. And then we would start with twelve people in the morning, and then by afternoon, six are gone. Right. That was the kind of situation that was there. And I was already trying to do something. But then my sister traveled to my place and she got COVID, and I also got COVID.
01:25:30.156 - 01:25:54.760, Speaker F: Like, actually when I started and wrote that tweet, that's a very angry I myself had COVID the second time. I was like, screw this virus. Because we have this fight and flight response. Right until now. At that time, we were in the flight mode, just go inside the house, stay there, locked up everything. I said, screw this virus. Not only I'm going to fight with this virus with my family, but I'm going to help other people also.
01:25:54.760 - 01:26:01.436, Speaker F: And I wrote that tweet. I thought probably we'll get like $1 million, $2 million. But then what Vitalik ended up doing.
01:26:01.538 - 01:26:03.656, Speaker A: With the Shiba coin with a billion.
01:26:03.768 - 01:26:42.932, Speaker F: Yeah, even he thought later on he said that I thought it is going to be $10 million or something. And then we ended up getting like $450,000,000 and all that. And I'm very proud to say, even though it's like slightly unfortunate for web3 and crypto industry in India, that here it's like an environment of slight distrust on it and all that, because governments fully don't understand this. But an important statistics for you all, even in this room, if you are an adult and you got vaccinated, one out of every three of you guys are vaccinated using the syringe donated by crypto Leaf.
01:26:42.996 - 01:26:46.572, Speaker A: Like we donated incredible. That's 100 what?
01:26:46.626 - 01:27:02.236, Speaker F: 200 million people, 200 million syringes we donated with UNICEF. And at that point in time, India got vaccines, but now there was a syringe problem. So we liaised with UNICEF, worked all around the world and got in 200 million syringes in India.
01:27:02.348 - 01:27:06.640, Speaker A: That is an impact that you literally cannot compete with.
01:27:06.710 - 01:27:23.204, Speaker F: Yes, and I want to say that is the impact of vitalik also. People keep asking me, but people don't realize that it's all because of vitalik. That's the impact of vitalik. And I would say ETH community also because he only gathered this thing. So shout out to the whole Ethereum.
01:27:23.252 - 01:27:51.490, Speaker A: Community globally, ethereum is the ultimate coordination mechanism for the world. And this is incredible progress. All right, I want to try to wrap this up soon. So let's go into a couple of specifics about what we should look forward to this weekend. 2000 people are sitting in front of us. The camera can't see it, but we can. What should they be thinking about and what should they be excited about to build in this space?
01:27:52.740 - 01:28:31.532, Speaker F: What I'm excited to build? Yes. And I want to give this message again to Indian all Indian developer fraternity, right. Build niche crypto use cases. Like I see the tendency in Indian developers that we are still going towards utility. Like, okay, let me build on this particular thing like a SaaS. Our mental model is more like building SaaS, building some profitable business and all that. I am saying that start thinking about niche crypto use cases like if you are building DeFi, build some these option models perpetuals and more optimized DEXes and things like that.
01:28:31.532 - 01:28:44.864, Speaker F: There are so many ideas going around, even in DeFi. Think about that. If there are any finance people liaise with them, brainstorm these ideas and all that. Even in NFTs and PFPs, I don't think a lot of Indian developers have done big.
01:28:45.062 - 01:29:00.470, Speaker A: Maybe as you're answering that, I'd love to kind of hear your thoughts on NFTs and DAOs and DeFi. Are you excited about still those things or how do you see them now, the NFTs, NFTs, DeFi dows as topics? Do you think there's still room to build more?
01:29:01.240 - 01:30:06.696, Speaker F: Sure, I feel that now they are much more relevant. Like if you were thinking of building a mainstream mass media kind of application. Now the focus is back onto these niche use cases. That's why I'm saying that maybe spend more time on your idea even here and once you go home because I feel like my mission is that how we are going to make India a web3 superpower is by building multiple unicorns. Web three unicorns from India and they will only be built if you build differentiated products. And right now the right time is for building those niche use cases. If you are building like NFT marketplace, think like what Pseudoswap has done, right? Can you solve those kind of use cases? NFT liquidity don't build the straightforward use cases like can you solve NFT liquidity by some means, right? Or in DAOs? How can you solve decision making processes in Dao? That's the biggest problem, right? Think about like if DAOs are going to be running businesses then they would have to take some sort of privacy, privacy decisions.
01:30:06.696 - 01:31:06.892, Speaker F: Also, how can you make sure that there are things which can be highly confidential thing in the context of a Dao but still the Dao can take the decision on that, right? Think about these kind of things and even in DeFi, like for example how DeFi products can manage their treasury, how they can increase the liquidity in their protocols and things like that like not the plain vanilla use cases because right now the markets we are in, not only in crypto generally startup markets, it's very, very hard to raise capital. And in order for you to grow and go to the next stage, you need to build these differentiated products. In this market, only the paranoid will survive and only the differentiated will survive. So make sure that you have those differentiation and build those niche use cases. Like let's build most innovative products, at least idea level. I know that in two days you can't build but at least on an idea level, let's see some of the best projects, some of the most innovative projects coming out of you guys. That's what I want you guys to do.
01:31:07.026 - 01:31:41.192, Speaker A: I know it sounds very counterintuitive, but to synthesize this is the perfect time for you to just try things because it might be cool and not because it can be a business. This is how large change happens. And once something is working or once something is interesting to somebody, you will figure out eventually how do you turn that into a product or a business. But especially when you have a small time constraint here the goal should be experimentation, as you already talked about and it should be the weird crazy shit that you really want to see.
01:31:41.246 - 01:32:11.028, Speaker F: That's why I think I forgot when you asked that what is the thing that keeps you up and all that? What is the thing you're worried about? And at Polygon also, as I was discussing with you that we wanted to build Polygon as the business layer of web Three where the businesses are built. But especially now, the time is that again, going back to the core web3 roots where you build things which are really cool, they might not look like as a business today. Like Uniswap didn't look like a business when Hayden started. Right.
01:32:11.114 - 01:32:14.336, Speaker A: We didn't know what AMMS could do. Now it's the default.
01:32:14.448 - 01:32:56.560, Speaker F: Yes, exactly. And build things like that. And because maybe they are cool, you are extremely thinking about something innovative or think about building things which have an impact. This is what I feel for Polygon community. I want to grow this segment where people who want to change the world not only build the business, who want to change the world, those kind of people into the Polygon community also, especially I was in Europe, and because a lot of our co founders, especially Jordy and all that, jordy is also a legend from the Ethereum community. I saw a lot of pride in a European community of Polygon. Even I heard this term called polygon maxi.
01:32:57.780 - 01:33:00.450, Speaker A: I think that's what we call success. Yes.
01:33:01.620 - 01:33:28.380, Speaker F: So people are trying to build things which can make an impact on the world. And that's why I think we also have a track where this is public goods. Like how can you make an impact on the world with these things? Try to build those things, not immediately focused on that. This can be a business, this can be a business. This is the right time to build those cool experimentations ideas because some of them are going to be so compelling that they will be the ones that will end up getting capital and growth opportunities.
01:33:28.720 - 01:33:32.668, Speaker A: I think that's a perfect note to end this on. Sandeep, thank you so much for joining us.
01:33:32.754 - 01:33:35.550, Speaker F: Thank you, everyone. Let's make it big, guys.
01:33:42.420 - 01:34:09.236, Speaker A: All right, now I'm going to try to talk really fast for 5 minutes and get all of you ready to hack the next stuff. And the only thing remaining is all the prizes. So let's try to do this very quickly. $350,000 of prizes to be won. I'm going to talk about all these prizes are and then I'm going to tell you where you can find all the specific details for all of them. So let's start with IPFS and filecoin. There are two tracks.
01:34:09.236 - 01:34:48.368, Speaker A: One of them is a General Storage track and an Fem track. Each of these tracks are offering $10,000 each. So you can get $2,000 for three teams for the best general storage track, which is just using IPFS or Filecoin. And there's a pool prize of $4,000, which means anybody who uses IPFS or Filecoin will be splitting this amount for up to $500 per person. Then the Fem track is if you get to deploy your contract to the FalcoIn virtual machine. You can also win $6,000 with $2,000 or three times of those prizes and a full prize for anybody deploying on Fem next up is the Polygon prize. Lot of amazing categories and prizes from Polygon.

01:41:55.228 - 01:42:19.612, Speaker A: So as we end this thing, I want to remind everybody that please pace yourself. We really want this thing to be fun and not exhausting for all of you. Want to make sure you use this as an opportunity to learn and understand what's possible in this space. And this is very much about experimentation as we just talked about with Sandeep. So the hope is that you get to try something that you hadn't tried before. And with that, I wish all of you happy. Hacking.
01:42:19.612 - 01:42:22.100, Speaker A: Let's let's get hacking everybody. And we'll see you here tomorrow.
