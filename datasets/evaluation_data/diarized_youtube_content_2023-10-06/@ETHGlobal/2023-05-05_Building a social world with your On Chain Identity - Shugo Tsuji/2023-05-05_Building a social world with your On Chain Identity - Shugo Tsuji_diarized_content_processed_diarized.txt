00:00:07.930 - 00:00:32.600, Speaker A: Hey guys, so thank you for coming. I'm Sugar. Okay, maybe let me introduce myself. I'm a co founder of Phi and yeah, so I'm like 22 years old and I'm from Japan so it's my home country. Welcome to Japan. I hope you guys are enjoying like Tokyo. Yeah and then yeah, so waking up early always give me stomachache so I don't want to wake up the morning.
00:00:32.600 - 00:01:02.590, Speaker A: Actually, I was working as Bench Capital in Japan for two years when I was in the highest mega university student. And then I moved to San Francisco. The 2021. August and then I just dive into their crypto world and they're testing some small NFD project and also some media. And then the last year, January, I started this project called Phi with my co founders.
00:01:03.430 - 00:01:04.180, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:05.190 - 00:02:15.320, Speaker A: And then actually before talking about my project I want to talk about what's identity and also how different the identity from how we can redefine the identity in the web3. Actually, what's the identity itself in the first place? It's the first question in my understanding. I don't care about the definition on the dictionary but in my definition. So identity is like how you view yourselves and then sometimes people are mixing the reputation and also credentials into the identity. Of course the reputation and also credential can be part of your identity but I think that's a difference. So reputation is how others view you so it's different thing. And then maybe these are very typical examples about thinking the reputation like the national ID and the school degree and which college did you graduate and also like exam score or something.
00:02:15.320 - 00:03:15.530, Speaker A: Yeah, this is like in the real world, right? Actually these repetition can help you think about who I am. But actually this is not yourself. I'm from Japan and Japan is of course one of my identity but it's not myself. And I really like the American culture as well and also I really like the Chinese food as well. So my identity is very chaos. But actually these reputation and credentials is very helpful for thinking about your identity and then what's the web3 identity and how different from the web two identity and also other real world identity. So I think in the web3 your identity nearly equal your wallet transactions history data.
00:03:15.530 - 00:04:17.950, Speaker A: So this is pretty different structure. In the web two, your data is stored on the Google's Dead server and also Facebook and also Twitter and GitHub. Each company has your own personal information and also which is distributed and if the company is disappear, your personal data is also disappeared, your history and your picture and your writings will go away. In the web3 every information is like stored on blockchain. So that's why I said that your identity is nearly equal to the nearly equal your world transactions history data. So this structure enable us to see the new way more web3 native way to represent identity. These are just examples.
00:04:17.950 - 00:05:25.934, Speaker A: We of course still using the Twitter stuff at GitHub DJ Score and also DeFi passports and also GitHub passports. So a bunch of new apps are trying to redefine the Web Three identity, right? So that's why the Web Three company and also other authorities in the real world are very struggling with transitioning their reputation and their authority into the own chain. So that's why it's a huge opportunity for us. And I'm very young, so that's why the young people or other people to create the new system to represent the identity. And then let me introduce my project called Phi phi XYZ. The language disappears, but yeah, so this is our application. We're trying to visualize the people's own chain identity in a more gamified way like SimCity, like Animal Crossing.
00:05:25.934 - 00:06:07.426, Speaker A: You can build your own city and also each round is represent your own chain identity. Like what did you do in crypto? What's your preference? And also what's the community and what's the social graph on the blockchain? We have the two website right now. One is the phiquest. This is phi. Connect the connector like five words and with the other protocols. So it's like a quest system like rabbit hole and layer three. So if you complete the onchain activity quest like swapping or uniswap lending or abe, you can get this object.
00:06:07.426 - 00:06:15.250, Speaker A: And yeah, this object is designed by Eboy. He's like a co founder of Nasdao. But yeah, that's why it's pretty cute.
00:06:16.090 - 00:06:16.840, Speaker B: Yes.
00:06:17.210 - 00:07:17.614, Speaker A: And also the other one is a fire end. So the object you acquired through the firequest, you can enjoy the Simsy right gamings in here. So you can populate your lands with the object you acquired on the quest and each object can show you some traction. And also the round represent your own identity. This is the interesting point and very different from other identity protocols is that people have to create yourself. Other social apps like Debunk, they're just like the feed that this is also helpful, what kind of transaction are you making yesterday and today? And the transaction will be showed on the feed. So actually there's not the curation and character.
00:07:17.614 - 00:08:03.990, Speaker A: So phi enable you to show you to create yourself and it's like Instagram. So you are archiving some post and also only posting a good looking picture. Something like that, you can emphasize some part of your tractions and also you can hide some traction on just like the database. So it's like the different point. So that's why I defined my product is like the Instagram or for Web Three. Of course people don't need to show the picture but people still keep the pseudonomy. But it's a new way to show yourself.
00:08:03.990 - 00:08:56.470, Speaker A: So it's like NFD PFB stuff. And also a bunch of people are sharing the fight and right now on the Twitter and also other ransom, they share some traction. Sorry for the cuttings of the slides but yeah so we are currently like 20,000 50,000 unique users, it's like monthly active users and then there are 50,000 plus runs created and the 2 million plus object claimed so far so actually it's four months since we launched our product. I think it's a great traction, it's like proving our thesis like people want to represent yourself with launching activities.
00:08:58.190 - 00:08:58.458, Speaker B: There.
00:08:58.464 - 00:10:00.974, Speaker A: Are a bunch of partners and that should be put together but yeah it's copied, I'm sorry it's just a wobble out to action like the last month actually in February. So we are the top one, top first social protocol on polygon protocol like Galaxy maybe we are doing well and also we are backed by the committee, strong committee like bank Rest guys and also Gitcoin co founder Scott and also the co founder of Isagobal Celtic. They're really supportive for our project and these strong committee enable us to connect with great protocols which is connected to provide the quality of our services to the users and I want to show.
00:10:01.012 - 00:10:01.600, Speaker B: You.
00:10:03.890 - 00:10:08.350, Speaker A: Quickly demo with touching our project, our protocol.
00:10:08.770 - 00:10:12.462, Speaker B: Sorry. Yes.
00:10:12.516 - 00:10:28.350, Speaker A: So this is the five quest. You can go to the quest list and there are a bunch of requests, and you can check SBT and actually, I claim the object. Like claimable?
00:10:28.430 - 00:10:28.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:28.712 - 00:11:36.618, Speaker A: But yeah, digestion score and the balancer like Azuki. We crop it with a bunch of protocols. You can try that and you can explore the quest and maybe you might will be try to some other quest. That's why a bunch of people said to us because of a fight they want to try to touch the abe or the rent protocol or something like that which is really good. Great positive feedback on web3 protocols not just working as the identity layer we're also working out onboarding platform to web3 by using the social incentives people want to be more unique and people want to represent them more so these social incentives are very strong which is really appropriate for the onboarding purpose. And also this is a rand. Oh my God.
00:11:36.704 - 00:11:40.134, Speaker B: Sorry. Yes.
00:11:40.192 - 00:12:17.640, Speaker A: So you can create the round from the es domain here's my ENS sugar Teaser. So this round is belong to the sugar teaser and then this is my round. So there is a uniswap like snapshot and also of course like Mitesitter and also disco drinks and Snapshots. You can create your own right now and if you have the ENS domain so I think it's a good opportunity to get the ENS and to do something to explore the WEBC world to the.
00:12:23.930 - 00:12:26.102, Speaker B: Go back to the yes.
00:12:26.156 - 00:13:42.190, Speaker A: So actually that's all from my side. Phi can grow together with our crypto community and then phi can contribute to the more onboarding the next million people into crypto space through some more gaming social way. Yes and actually this round is just what was the starting point. We're currently developing the more avatar function and also like music NFT integration stuff. Our concept is mainly utilizing on chain activities in a more social and gaming way and which can incentivize people to the touching protocols. Yes, that's why right now just like seeing the run right now but actually you will be able to jump into the run and also communicate with your friends more like becoming the interactive. Maybe your Albato will also changing depends on their own check activities.
00:13:42.190 - 00:14:51.660, Speaker A: So that's why everything is connected to the blockchain data and then you can play the blockchain with the phi as far is working as playable I mean the playable layer of the blockchain itself. So yeah, that's a concept. And what we are trying to do, if you think about the web, two adaption they started from the Facebook and other socials without monetary incentivizes. A bunch of people are trying to show the connection and also social graphs on the internet and which is create a strong Internet culture. So we want to do same thing in the website space. People will represent themselves on the blockchain and also planning their identity on the blockchain so I think which can be connected to the next mass adoption of the web. Three.
00:14:51.660 - 00:15:26.710, Speaker A: That's why the identity and also mass adoption is very connected. Actually, Phi is just like one way to get more mass. Adoption, but yeah. So we hope they keep working on this project. And then two diversified way for you to represent the Onchi identity and then also playing the world of the web3. That's all from my side. So thank you for your listening.
00:15:50.290 - 00:15:51.040, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:54.530 - 00:16:01.780, Speaker A: Maybe we have the suit time so yeah if you have any questions just let me know.
00:16:05.170 - 00:16:05.950, Speaker B: Yep.
00:16:17.600 - 00:16:41.220, Speaker A: So far like the phiquest that's the most like the active protocol actually phiquest is not stricted to ENS holders so that's why anyone can start from the phi quest and then they explode the protocols. So actually getting the ENS is kind of like one request for getting Iran.
00:16:44.920 - 00:16:46.230, Speaker B: Yes, that's right.
00:16:49.500 - 00:17:05.150, Speaker A: The phi quest unique unique wallet address there is like 70 72,000 and then the phyland is like 50,000 like the rand so yeah kind of that rate so maybe we can improve more.
00:17:11.500 - 00:17:27.446, Speaker B: You want to see that? Could you show the my PC? Yeah so this is our dashboard here.
00:17:27.548 - 00:17:29.960, Speaker A: There are five quest unique user and.
00:17:31.630 - 00:17:51.596, Speaker B: Unique user and number of finance and total object minted like that yes could.
00:17:51.618 - 00:18:12.720, Speaker A: You elaborate a little bit more? You mean about data? You mean how we can be finding the.
00:18:23.680 - 00:18:25.790, Speaker B: Yes, sorry.
00:18:31.780 - 00:18:40.530, Speaker A: Yes each round is like they belong to each ENS domain. So that's why if you transfer the ENS so round also transfer so far.
00:18:52.350 - 00:18:52.810, Speaker B: Yes.
00:18:52.880 - 00:19:52.958, Speaker A: So yeah actually that's one of the reason we use ENS for the creating run. So actually we are now strict to bright ID or not like KYC stuff right? So that's why people doesn't need to be strict to the one identity. So maybe I can have the sugar teaser and also other maybe I don't know pixel artist user. So any identity we can have, that's why we use ENS. I think that's a really good like the level of the restriction about the identity. So yeah, you can keep the pseudonymity and also you can have multiple identity with the ENS domain. Okay, maybe I can answer one more question.
00:19:53.044 - 00:20:05.080, Speaker B: So if you have it go through in the mana.
00:20:08.810 - 00:20:24.890, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's like the one by one right now this year. Yeah, kind of fight avatar stuff.
00:20:24.960 - 00:20:33.466, Speaker B: So yeah, we are contributing. Yes.
00:20:33.568 - 00:21:16.314, Speaker A: So we're kind of using off chain verification, not like the fully on chain verification like the market tree. We are just using the AWS backend actually we are reading the user's own chatfed data from the various API stuff including subgraphs. So that's for example holding some esaquest we are using the ESOS count API currently and then if the address meets the requirements we issue the coupon on our AWS backend and then people will.
00:21:16.352 - 00:21:23.020, Speaker B: Be able to claim the object. Yes.
00:21:29.480 - 00:22:20.950, Speaker A: Some protocol are providing API stuff but some protocol doesn't not right. So that's why maybe we are developing the case by case. So our back end actually we can use the shismo they're using the market tree for verifying the activities that could not be dynamic because we have to update the time. So that's why we have to deploy the market tree every time you want to update the status. So that's why we are more focusing on real time experience. So that's why we are kind of using more off chain solution about it.
00:22:27.070 - 00:22:33.660, Speaker B: Yeah, user generated quests and art. So I know right now.
00:22:49.740 - 00:23:44.408, Speaker A: Yeah, actually we are kindly thinking to separate two layers. Actually, first layer is like the existing five quest. We are very creating the protocols to provide the best onboarding experience to users right now. But it's like RB centralized and not like the web3. Right, so that's why we're going to prepare one more layer. Actually it's still discussing discussing right now, but yeah, not disgusting. We're going to prepare one more layer to accept more and more protocols more and more project identify which is more pretty like casual, like maybe batches or something like that.
00:23:44.408 - 00:24:03.644, Speaker A: And then people can easily to create the object or batches and then they can do the campaign by themselves which is more like the very casual layer. It's like more galaxy, it's more like pop stuff. But maybe that isn't the need. It for more getting the users onto Fi.
00:24:03.692 - 00:24:13.040, Speaker B: So yeah, okay, I think last a minute.
00:24:13.780 - 00:24:21.724, Speaker A: So thank you for listening my presentation. So my English is still terrible, but yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed my presentation.
00:24:21.852 - 00:24:22.270, Speaker B: Thank you.
