00:00:05.490 - 00:00:57.410, Speaker A: All right, everyone, I'm going to wait a minute or two as more people join. Welcome. You are at the right place if you were trying to get to the hack feedback session. Three demo feedback I'm about to post in the chat here in Zoom, the ad hoc sign up sheet. So if you want to get some feedback, just go into that, put the name of your project, and you might hear this message repeated because people are joining as we go. Thank you all. All right, we have more people joining.
00:00:57.410 - 00:01:30.426, Speaker A: This is our hack feedback session. You're here joined by several people who are going to offer some feedback. We have Marius Vanderwigen, who's one of our he's volunteered to be one of our tech mentors. You may have seen him in the chats. We have Luke Bateman on the East Global team. And we have Nicholas Santoni. Everyone say hello, guys.
00:01:30.426 - 00:02:11.770, Speaker A: Hey, guys. We're going to keep this pretty informal. My job is to sort of keep things on time, roughly, but we do want you guys to get some good feedback. You have the option of sharing screen and trying to walk through your demo if it's ready, or if it's partially ready, or if you just want to talk about your ideas and your direction, whatever seems appropriate, whatever you want feedback on. We're looking pretty good on just a few teams at the moment, so sometimes teams join later. So we'll just get right into it. We have flaunt.
00:02:11.770 - 00:02:22.646, Speaker A: Is Project Flaunt here? This is me. Yeah. Can you guys hear me? Yes. Cool. All right. Yeah. I'll go ahead and share my screen.
00:02:22.646 - 00:02:46.434, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Can you guys see that looks good. I've just cranked down my resolution a bit. Cool. Yeah. This has just been a solo hack, really, just for me personally to go a bit deeper on L two S.
00:02:46.434 - 00:03:00.050, Speaker A: And it's definitely helped in that the premise of it. And by the way, shall I just jump in there's? No. Good. Cool. Yeah. Let me just move a couple of things around here so I can see things. Zoom windows.
00:03:00.050 - 00:03:42.600, Speaker A: Yeah. So the premise is, and again, still wrapping things up with it, but allow you to kind of remix existing NFTs that you have and flaunt them more. And that might be like downstream monetization of them. If it's an NFT you already own or licensing or whatever, right now, basically anyone can remix an NFT. It's not checking that you actually are the owner of it, but that wouldn't be too hard to add. And the emphasis is on mimifying the NFTs as well. So there's a little bit of a workflow baked in and I can show you guys.
00:03:42.600 - 00:04:07.150, Speaker A: So, again, hopefully you can see this, but you load an existing NFT. So there's like five samples. There this contract address. Here is foundations contract address. So it's kind of neat. So you can just kind of randomly select one and it will import that and you'll see what that means in a moment. Or you can just select an existing sample NFT asset.
00:04:07.150 - 00:04:29.586, Speaker A: Let's just try loading. I've got to check that. Yeah. So if the actual underlying NFT is a video, like an MP4, then it doesn't work because it can embed that in the canvas. So there we go. Just random one. And then what you can do is just go ahead and memify it.
00:04:29.586 - 00:04:51.066, Speaker A: So let me just start with the troll. This is kind of secondary. This isn't scaling stuff yet, but that's just kind of fun. And it's actually become kind of addictive for me to play around with it. Add a bit of doge. You can also add text. There we go.
00:04:51.066 - 00:05:20.702, Speaker A: We've pretty quickly, rapidly memified that. And we can go ahead and save it demo. And then this saves it to IPFS. And what it actually does is saves the image. This actually took a little bit of hacking because it saves it as an SVG with the image actually embedded. Just because I'm using a library called IPFS Mini. I couldn't get it to save the image.
00:05:20.702 - 00:05:58.026, Speaker A: Just natively, but it still works. It's kind of cool. Little hack in the true hack of the sense. And you can also see the metadata as well with the IPFS CID pointing to the original image, the image we just saw added just for kind of fun, the ability to preserve it with filecoin. In the past, outside of the hack, I do a lot of work with various things and had worked on some filecoin flavored ganache. So if you've got that running, you can actually simulate a preservation, like the creation of a deal and stuff, but won't show that just now. Or you can just kind of pin it and preserve it with a pinning service such as Pinata.
00:05:58.026 - 00:06:26.874, Speaker A: Either way, all good. So we've generated the asset and now getting to, I guess, the scaling point. Go ahead and mint. So you can either mint directly to L One, so if you've got like MetaMask installed or a wallet, you can just go ahead and mint it directly to L One and then the scaling piece. And again, by the way, been dipping in and out of this hack, so I haven't had a ton of time what you can do. So I've got support for scale right now. I haven't actually set this bit up.
00:06:26.874 - 00:06:51.406, Speaker A: It does work, but I haven't sort of tested it in advance. So you can switch your mathematics to scale. Yeah, I won't do this just because the account I've got currently loaded here doesn't have any SKE in it. But you get the idea that would just mint it to scale. You can also mint it Arbitrum via Taurus as well. So if you don't have MetaMask installed or don't have a wallet, I'm already logged in here. I didn't show that workflow.
00:06:51.406 - 00:07:14.278, Speaker A: But this allows you to log in with Taurus and you can see here. This is a separate address. This is my first time using Taurus. It's really cool. And then associate balance. There L one balance and then the Arbitrarium balance ETH balance because you need that. And then there's a little bit of this is just some of their boilerplate code that they provided.
00:07:14.278 - 00:07:36.126, Speaker A: And then you can actually go ahead and mint it to argue this may just work. Let's try it out. Cool. So that's done. So that's minted. And then we have a gallery as well. Now, this is still kind of I think that might be it.
00:07:36.126 - 00:07:52.482, Speaker A: But that said, I haven't actually got a distinction right now of what this gallery is. Pretty naive. It's pretty basic. It doesn't actually fully work, but you get the idea. You can see where it's been minted. Oh, let me switch back to Coban here. Some of this is still a bit kind of work in progress.
00:07:52.482 - 00:08:29.154, Speaker A: But if I switch back to Coban and refresh I mean, you saw the assets, but it has been minted. And you can see just example ones here. So these are prime minted. The bit that's kind of still outstanding is then bridging it back. So the minted NFT to the L two, bridging that back to the L one as well. So it would be a separate little bit of additional workflow which hopefully I'll get a chance to finish. Is again, this link won't actually go to the correct asset because the ID is putting at one that's already on coven on the L one.
00:08:29.154 - 00:08:46.934, Speaker A: But it will be a separate route where it's like, hey, looking at the asset on Arbitrarim. And then just a little bit of workflow to submit that back, to send it back to the L one. Again, some of this, it's not too much. It's not hard, per se. It's just I haven't got around to it yet. Cool. Yeah.
00:08:46.934 - 00:09:10.400, Speaker A: So that's it. And then the idea final point, I guess point being about Flaunting is you could then and it's actually all live as well flaunt here, as in just pushing it up as it goes. So you can actually go into the gallery and see essentially the same assets. Kind of, yeah. So it's actually been fun. Now I've got it kind of mostly working. It's kind of fun to hack around and memify things and so on.
00:09:10.400 - 00:09:29.974, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. That's where it's at. That's cool. From my standpoint, I really like the simplicity of the interface. I really think NFTs is just that space that a lot of newbies. Just want that simplicity to be drawn in.
00:09:29.974 - 00:09:41.420, Speaker A: So I really like that. But please open up to feedback. Sure. Can start if you like. Quick one. Well, it's a good one. I mean, definitely interesting.
00:09:41.420 - 00:10:20.998, Speaker A: I agree on the simplicity. And NFTs. They have been proved to be an entry point for so many newbies. Right. So it's good to keep it simple. So I agree. There one quick thing is your idea to build it? Like you see more like a standalone product or a future and you will see this is going to sound like a broken record but it's quite important even if it's like a project or an Akaton to have a sort of like clarity if it's a product that could be a standalone and what's the value proposition? Or at least on a V one.
00:10:20.998 - 00:11:25.946, Speaker A: Right? So that you can have also a feedback on something that it's envisioned to provide a certain service or certain value to the community in a sense. Or you can also think it like a feature that you mentioned foundation and stuff so apply to another protocol. So what's your idea on this? What's your direction? Great question. Yeah, again I've embraced it in the spirit of just a pure hack in a sense. But no, I mean as I've kind of hacked on it, where I see it potentially going is people are paying a lot for these NFTs obviously and being able to monetize them in a kind of derivative type way. So if you own an asset and then let's say you own like a beeple or something and then you would remix a little bit and or sign it maybe because let's know this is very valuable and then you just kind of just take a moment to load that's in black. But yeah, justified it.
00:11:25.946 - 00:12:20.380, Speaker A: Put my signature there all out that snowden piece which sold for a lot and then maybe the owner of that could do something with it and then maybe mint x derivations of that and then sell those. So it's kind of like opening up again, there's more potential open up to kind of build upon the art. Right? Which is something build upon these assets. Look, I get it so much that we led around of NFT platform called Async Art where they know that that's super cool man. You really open it to the masters and the layers and you can really own it to modify it. So there is definitely a scope out there and I could see somebody signing. So good job.
00:12:20.380 - 00:13:10.570, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, thanks. Cool. Anyone else? I think it's just a really interesting commentary on the sort of crowdsourced nature of internet humor as well as the iterative value of contemporary like modern art. So I think this is a really cool step in that direction just to assess what is happening with NFTs, make something that furthers what is occurring but also like a very apt commentary on the nature of what is it to be new as a piece of art, what qualifies there. So I know that might not have been the original intent, but I think this opens up a lot of interesting questions about what we are going to consider quality based. Yeah, great hack.
00:13:10.570 - 00:13:25.310, Speaker A: Thanks Luke. Awesome. Well, thanks for sharing man. I really appreciate it. Likewise. Yeah, thanks for listening. Please stick around and continue working and hang out.
00:13:25.310 - 00:14:03.226, Speaker A: Cool. Our next project is Investinpro investin pro. Are we here? Hi. Everyone. This is Zaheeb from Investin Pro. All right, my team hasn't joined yet so we couldn't be showcasing our project yet, but I can just walk you through the idea and we have built a long way so we have chosen to scale up on Arbitrum. We are currently building on Ethereum.
00:14:03.226 - 00:15:07.514, Speaker A: So our central idea is a decentralized fund management protocol, something similar to enzyme finance if people are aware and we've been working on it and the whole idea works around bringing NFTs to use. So NFTs are mostly right now concentrated upon art but we thought of using it for a specific use case. So we have built a platform which actually incentivizes NFT owners in terms of investments. So you come to a protocol, you find a bunch of funds listed out there and just like a traditional finance fund market where you go and you find fund managers managing a portfolio of funds and you choose your manager accordingly and you start investing in it. And in the same way we list out a bunch of fund managers and this is open to all. You can come up and create a fund of your own and it's all tracked live. So Blockchain brings up a question of truthfulness.
00:15:07.514 - 00:16:16.578, Speaker A: You can't fake stuff so you are showing your fund performance live for everyone to see and people can just come up with the wallet and invest in your fund. So the moment they make an investment we track the metadata using an NFT so that's ivny. So that's the whole idea of our project. We track investments using NFTs and that's basically putting them to use and then we start auto compounding your investments whenever a new user comes into the same account. So basically right now all fund management protocols including even pairs on Uniswap they utilize the ERC 20 token standard to track your share of portfolio unless V three comes in and now it's already been live. So now you have even uniswap tracking your pool ratio your liquidity position using an NFT. So the same idea we have been utilizing it and scaling it in a way where people come in and in Ethereum if you wanted to achieve the many to many mapping of a normal data structure it was a difficult task because a lot of data had to be updated.
00:16:16.578 - 00:17:26.930, Speaker A: So NFTs make up a good use here and that's what we have been doing. We have utilized NFTs to track positions and then the real problem with having and tracking a portfolio on chain is getting the asset price. So we have chainlink and other providers which provide us the on chain price Oracles but they do not track all the assets that are listed on Uniswap. So if a manager tries to interact with a token which is not currently listed on decentralized price Oracles, then we had to rely upon our own calculation mechanisms and that's what we have done. We have created on chain Oracles for our own protocol and we've been tracking all of that. The problem we faced right now is that exchanges on L two S are not that liquid. I mean, you have uniswap sushi swap and other exchanges on the base layer that provide us all the opportunity to trade in comparable to what centralized I think we might have lost your audio there.
00:17:26.930 - 00:18:10.926, Speaker A: Yeah. For some reason you've cut out there. Right. And you're back. And that's been a challenge for us because first of all, we need our investors to come onto the layer two using their own bridges. So if you want to move your assets to Arbitrum, they've got to utilize their own bridge, which takes a lot of time, which right now takes around two days of time to move your assets from your base layer of ethereum to your maybe arbitram or optimism. All of these layer twos, they require a bit of time because of the consensus mechanism utilized there.
00:18:10.926 - 00:18:53.062, Speaker A: So we have been trying to smooth that out, I mean, trying to build a system which actually pushes through that. And once you are onto layer two again, you find the lack of liquidity on those exchanges to be a hurdle. So we have been trying to find solutions for that and hope if we stick around for a while, I'll get my team and we can also demonstrate a lifelor of that. So that's it from Investin Pro. I guess given some more time, once other projects finish up, I could come back to the loop and give a live demonstration of that. Yeah, well, great. Thanks for that explanation.
00:18:53.062 - 00:19:37.814, Speaker A: We lost a little bit of your audio in there, but I don't know if anyone, from what we heard, anyone have any thoughts or feedback, can start very quickly. Yeah, would be curious to look at it. There is quite a little bit cooking, right. Like different challenges. The product seems also well thought, but to be developed. Are you planning to do something like DeHedge or like Priest? Okay. It's limited to synthetic assets, so it's not open to every asset on ethereum out there.
00:19:37.814 - 00:19:53.694, Speaker A: So we are trying to build something that's generic and which is more closely tied to enzyme or Mellon protocol, if you have heard. Of course. Of course. Yeah. We invested on the edge and other stuff on DeFi, so I'm familiar. But the edge, of course, is on top of synthetic oxide. So that's the idea.
00:19:53.694 - 00:20:39.994, Speaker A: And you also sort of like incentivizing those managers to attract investors and they get like a sort of performance fee for their profits. Everything that's exactly similar to BH. And the only place where we put out our unique selling position is that we track every investment using an NFD so they don't have to mint ERG 20 tokens for every fund. Independently. We have a single contract which manages all investments across all funds. And there's just a single metadata that is required to be captured on every transaction. So we have reduced the investment costs, I mean the gas costs, to around a third of what it actually costs you on DH.
00:20:39.994 - 00:20:59.890, Speaker A: And we are opening a gateway to all assets on Ethereum. We're not just limited to synthetics or any other central authority, so we are open to all assets. Okay, good stuff. I'd love to see it when it comes to fruition. Sure. Great. Thanks for sharing.
00:20:59.890 - 00:21:55.480, Speaker A: Really appreciate that. Just a quick reminder. There's a sign up sheet that I posted in the chat I will repost right now if you just joined and you want some feedback. And also just for a little bit of framing, if you want feedback to be a little specific about judging for this particular hackathon, just remember you have four minute for your video in the video demo, no less than two minutes for that and a four minute maximum for your video demo. And then there's three minutes of discussion for seven minute total. That's for your judging session. Just so you know, we don't have to address that specifically in this feedback session, but if you want some feedback on how you present or how you go through it, we can do that too.
00:21:55.480 - 00:22:13.366, Speaker A: All right, thanks. To invest in Pro. Maybe we'll see you guys later. Now we'll move on to my yield. Get more matic with your matic. My yield here. Hey, how you guys doing? I'm here to get you more matic with your matic.
00:22:13.366 - 00:22:47.622, Speaker A: So when the hackathon started, basically ave released their liquidity mining incentives. And so I basically built a product around that. And I'm going to start sharing my screen. Let me know if you see it. And with this act, I'm aiming to win rewards for Ave, the graph and polygon. So this is deployed on Matic. And since we have to ship by Sunday, and it's a solo use, we interchangeably, but it's a solo project.
00:22:47.622 - 00:23:30.978, Speaker A: So since I have to ship by Sunday, I decided to just focus on one vault and try to do the best I can and then focus on presentation and polish rather than adding more vaults. What this does is it basically allows a simple way to deposit. And do you guys see my screen? You can see that I have some Wmatic, so I can just deposit it. And for security reasons, I always ask for allowance. I did submit this for a peer review on Dow reviews. However, I think $1,000 bounty is not enough. But if any of you guys watching this video would like to do a peer review, you can go on Dow reviews and just there's $1,000 bounty on this.
00:23:30.978 - 00:24:26.530, Speaker A: So once you deposit, you get issued share that are based on the value of your deposit. And I basically launched a version two in order. I basically launched the second version that uses the graph to track deposits. It tracks the value that was earned, the value that was deposited, and the shares that are minted. And it also allows you to track your own stats. As for how the strategy works, it's basically based on getting as many liquidity rewards as possible from Ave, which means that we take the TVL and then based on the TVL, we just deposit and we borrow and land and borrow and land and borrow and land as much as we can so that we're properly leveraged. And I would say the biggest challenge that I had was that there was no documentation.
00:24:26.530 - 00:25:22.466, Speaker A: So I basically had to reverse engineer the Staking GitHub library as they developed it. And I believe the documentation came out maybe five days ago. So I basically shipped then. Basically it's currently earning 21%. Although there's actually a bot called my yield Bot that is checking if the and there's like a security check for it being whitelisted because rebalancing can potentially cause losses. So this account is whitelisted and it basically is allowed to deposit and borrow. So I could spin up a new vault for USDC in probably alpha an hour because I can just change the addresses and basically I can have a second vault.
00:25:22.466 - 00:26:11.000, Speaker A: Although I was focused mostly on polishing this experience and making it as simple as possible. And so I believe that what is missing here is that you're not going to see your expected gains. And I was thinking about adding some sort of chart so that you will see either a projected Apr, projected gains or you could see your unclaimed rewards because the contract is continuously compounding. So to just look at a number here may not be enough of feedback, but I'm very open to advice. Cool. Yeah. Anyone? Okay.
00:26:11.000 - 00:26:55.080, Speaker A: Chow. Alex, your GitHub name gives away my yes, definitely look good stuff. One simple point. Maybe start with the central idea, which are you allowing Matic to borrow and lend directly through that's? That's what you're trying to do? Basically, yeah, that's what I did. I can show you the smart contract as well, but it's a leveraged farm for Malik rewards. Okay, perfect. Yeah.
00:26:55.080 - 00:27:43.206, Speaker A: So in general, good representation. Good. Also, the UI seems pretty straightforward, but start with the central idea of your project and then expand on all the different things that you could do with it. Basically, yeah. So would you say it's best to perhaps have a chart show the rewards earned rather than, for example, having a second vault for USDC? Well, maybe yes. I think, look, since you have to start with something, start with one vault and have all the full suite around that, I would say. But also as a presentation, I would say.
00:27:43.206 - 00:28:13.180, Speaker A: Right. Instead of guessing what could be doing or what is actually doing, maybe start with 110 seconds sentence of this project that's this and this leverage, these connections, these protocols. And that's the goal of the project. In a sense, it's always better to start like this so that the viewers don't have to guess on what might be doing. That's all. Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
00:28:13.180 - 00:29:12.834, Speaker A: I will state my goals first and then go into more details. I would say there's a lot of tech that I can talk about, but would you say I should just focus on more of the benefits and just keeping it simple? Yeah, sure. I mean, my perspective, there's different people that might be intrigued, interested on different stuff. Obviously the tech is cool, but it's more like from a Usability user perspective. Right? Like what allows you to do. Maybe you can talk about also the challenges, maybe you could talk about what needs to be done, maybe what it's also nice, I mean, I speak with like maybe two, three, 4510 projects per day. It's nice to see the vision, so it's nice to present like, okay, in a week I can do this, in a month I could do this, but in a year this could become this.
00:29:12.834 - 00:30:14.782, Speaker A: So that's also important. Now it's an Akaton, of course, you just started and there is a very constrained time and tools. But if you have an idea, you should also show what you have but also present the long term vision, midterm vision and so on. That's up to you to know where the platform could do and what the product could do. But it's nice also to see from your own perspective what can be done with this tech, right? Definitely, yeah. I would say that I basically built a vault where the strategies are hard coded in the smart contract, while my goal is to separate the vault code from the strategist code, which is literally the yearn way. But my next goal, and I'm actually going to participate on Gitcoin with the Badger Grant and I'm going to be building a USDC to bitcoin vault.
00:30:14.782 - 00:30:46.638, Speaker A: Basically the goal is take your dollars and earn more bitcoin. But I know that with the free weeks I had and all of the stuff that I had to learn, I wouldn't be able to do that. So that's my next goal. Would you say I should mention that in the presentation to show a roadmap? If you like it, yes, why not? I would suggest so, yeah. It's nice to see that you have a vision that you want it's much more than just what you see and it could be much bigger. That's always good sign. Absolutely awesome.
00:30:46.638 - 00:31:05.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. Definitely good to just mention that you have this bigger view of what's going on too. I think that helps. Thank you Alex. Thank you guys for your time. Thanks. All right, again, if you just joined, there's a sign up sheet I posted in the chat.
00:31:05.430 - 00:32:01.080, Speaker A: Our next project is Vidhasher Gabriel. Vidhasher, can you hear me? Yes. So the idea is to make a distributed database where I can perceptually hash a video and see what files have that same idea, the same information. Because sometimes you have a video, but it's encoded in various formats, various resolutions, or sometimes it's cropped. So I want a way to locate them and to help me the preservation. So let me see if I can stream here. Is it working? Yes.
00:32:01.080 - 00:33:55.580, Speaker A: So I made a Python program that can open a video and use an algorithm called P hash and split it up to create a list of short Identifiers that we can put into a distributed database on Ethereum database, where who can vote if the information provided is correct or not. So here I have the Identifiers for a replic scene of this video that I used. And the idea is that I can then publish it is on the smart contract Smash, for example. This will be automated. Unfortunately, I had to make part of the code in Python, part in Go, and I'm still merging the information. So once the people vote, I can then search by the perceptual hash to list which files contain that scene I'm looking for. Now, the idea is to make a bit of a better interface, including publishing it directly the file directly to IPFS, but I still haven't managed to integrate it all.
00:33:55.580 - 00:34:36.300, Speaker A: Very interesting. Really cool. I love it. I think it's a great thing. So you said p hash. This is some kind of robust hash function, right? Yeah, it's actually a specific one. Let me see if I can find it to show you it's based.
00:34:36.300 - 00:35:27.660, Speaker A: Yeah, never mind. I can look it up myself. But can you see the algorithm I'm using, Scott P hash, and it takes the image, reduces it, removes the color, and use discrete co sign transformations to take the most important info. Now, this algorithm was made for images. So I take my whole video, do it frame by frame, and try to identify scenes by seeing segments which the P hash value doesn't change much. And then you always take the first hash of the scene as an Identifier for the scene? No, I take kind of an average. Okay.
00:35:27.660 - 00:36:18.410, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. Yeah, I think it's a great idea. It's a great thing. One problem, I don't know about the voting part, so I I understand what yeah, the voting like, I understand what you're trying to go for. Right. Like, you have different people proposing different scenes, and you have to vote on them to see if they are really the scene or if someone just tries to cheat something in there. Yeah, there was the problem of spam, but that's the best I could manage for hackathon.
00:36:18.410 - 00:37:03.890, Speaker A: In theory, we could do the video processing in a distributed fashion. I think there is a coin called VideoCoin that does this kind of thing, but it seemed way too much of a hassle for a simple demo. Yeah, I think we should keep as much data off chain as possible. So yeah, no, I really like the project. I think you probably have to work a bit on your presentation. I'm not a big presentation guy myself, so I would just present it as you would probably. So maybe the other mentors have some better suggestions for that.
00:37:03.890 - 00:37:52.144, Speaker A: I think maybe Luke seems also interested, so he can hurt. Definitely on the technical side more than myself, that's for sure. Yeah, on the maybe product side and on the presentation, that's okay. Maybe you can also think and discuss with the audience about the use cases. So who could use it? Where do you see in use on a platform or a product standalone. So maybe try to fit it in an ecosystem that is already existing. Right.
00:37:52.144 - 00:38:13.956, Speaker A: Like on products that we all might be familiar with or I don't know, because I'm not 100% sure yet where and how you would use it. And what are the use cases. Maybe you can expand a little bit. Think like web archive. Okay. Like the Internet Archive. They usually don't archive whole videos because that's way too much info.
00:38:13.956 - 00:38:43.200, Speaker A: But in theory they could do something like this, where they store the hash, the perceptual hash of the video. So if later on someone still has a copy of it, you can still recover part of the information. I see. Okay. So it's more like a retrieving sort of function, in a sense, on an archive, correct? Yes. More like media preservation. Preservation.
00:38:43.200 - 00:40:03.630, Speaker A: I think maybe you could start by telling a story of have you ever use case? Yeah. Have you ever had a video out of some movie and you didn't know which movie it was? Or something like this? Or have you ever had some corrupted snippet from a YouTube video and you wanted to find this YouTube video and you didn't know how to search for it? Now you can do this by just using my thing and publishing maybe also, like publishing a request online. And other people can try to share their files to find it for you and set up some bounty or something like this. I think you could think a bit about a story because people really like to connect with the stories. Then it's probably easier for the average judge to connect to the project and think about it. Yeah, it's a great feedback. Yeah, I agree.
00:40:03.630 - 00:40:52.910, Speaker A: And just along those lines, in your hacker dashboard, there's a hack submission and judging guide. But at the bottom there's a bunch of demo videos that have worked well in the past to just look at unrelated but sort of presenting the use case or what problem does this solve right at the start and because it's video, throw in some juicy video or interesting video, capture the video part, which is super cool. Everybody gets that. And then you got the technical walkthrough. Definitely do that. And then it starts to gel, I think, as a four minute demo. Okay, cool.
00:40:52.910 - 00:41:19.350, Speaker A: Work, man. Thanks for presenting. Appreciate it. Thank you. Next up is Project Ticket Share, an affiliate marketing system with enhanced financial incentives. Ticket Share. Uhoh, ticket share is not here.
00:41:19.350 - 00:41:46.010, Speaker A: I see there is a gap of, like, six projects. Yeah, I think they were putting it he hopes, like, okay, let's gain some time. And then he didn't know that we're actually jumping on him right now. Yeah, I'll see if NFT puzzle thing is here. NFT puzzle. Yeah. Hi, we're here.
00:41:46.010 - 00:42:14.770, Speaker A: Hi, guys. Hey. Hello. Okay, awesome. So we've attended the last two feedback sessions as well, so I think, Andrew, you've probably seen our thing, but for people who haven't yet, we'd love to gain some feedback right now. So I'm just going to do a quick demo. You can you guys can see my right? Yes.
00:42:14.770 - 00:42:42.492, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. So what we're building here is we're basically trying to gamify NFTs. We're building a puzzle out of it. So how it works is we have things called as loot boxes, right? So people purchase loot boxes, which give them a few pieces. Now, what those pieces are, we have a couple of puzzles on the platform. I just have tabs open so that we don't have to wait for requests to go through.
00:42:42.492 - 00:43:25.048, Speaker A: But basically, we have a few ongoing puzzles. Right? Now, these puzzles are generated, and at any point of time, there will be, let's say, four ongoing puzzles. Now, when somebody purchases a loot box, he gets pieces for random pieces for any of the ongoing puzzles. So let's say there's this puzzle three, right? So this puzzle, these are my pieces, right? So these are random pieces that I got from loot boxes. Now, let's say this is a five x five puzzle here. So now I need 25 pieces in order to complete this puzzle. And once I get enough pieces, I can verify the puzzle.
00:43:25.048 - 00:44:13.070, Speaker A: And this is basically a race to be the first one to finish a puzzle. And once somebody is able to finish a puzzle, he can claim it, and it will basically be an NFT that will get minted and transferred to his address. So just to give you a quick demo, our loot boxes so people can buy loot boxes. They can do a batch, purchase, or buy single loot boxes. So one loot box gives a user ten random pieces of the ongoing puzzles. So let's just do a quick buy here. This will take a second.
00:44:13.070 - 00:44:32.876, Speaker A: We have to wait for chainlink VRFs to return a value. So that takes, like, a couple of seconds. And we have graph. Okay, that was quick. Awesome. So we purchased the loot box. Now it'll take a couple of seconds to reflect here, but in the meanwhile, we already have a couple of loot boxes.
00:44:32.876 - 00:45:47.830, Speaker A: So let's just do a quick unboxing and give this a second. So these are the random pieces that we got, and these random pieces were generated through chainlink. So we can see every piece has a unique token ID as well, right? So these can be repeated pieces as well, because we have to keep it as random as possible. Now, let's just say let's just assume we have enough pieces here. We just recently deployed a new contract, so we don't have enough pieces for any puzzle right now. But what basically happens is once somebody is able to get all the pieces, he needs to arrange those in this grid here, just a basic drag and drop, and hit the verify puzzle button. And after that, he can see that in his winnings tab once it goes through.
00:45:47.830 - 00:46:16.168, Speaker A: So I don't have any claimed NFT, any unclaimed or claimed puzzles right now, but it'll basically show up here. And once it gets claimed, we also have integrated OpenSea. So once it gets claimed, we'll show an option for the user. Can see it on OpenSea as well. Okay. I can show the OpenSea part. I guess I have the example for awesome.
00:46:16.168 - 00:46:48.660, Speaker A: Awesome. You want to take it over? Sure, yeah. Awesome. Just to mean by parallel. So these are the My Pieces page, which will list all the pieces, active pieces, actually. And so expired pieces will basically show pieces that are no longer useful for the puzzles that are either already completed or basically the puzzles that are already completed. And we have Marketplace, which will allow users to trade, like they do, a one to one NFT swap.
00:46:48.660 - 00:47:23.476, Speaker A: So let's say I have pieces A and B, and I want a piece Z, so I can put up a listing saying, okay, I have pieces A and B, and I'm willing to trade them in order to get that piece X. And somebody shows up, he's like, okay, bro, I got X and Y, and I want this. You know, we have a Marketplace set up for that as well. So yeah, that's pretty much it for the demo. I'll hand it over to Sneh to show you the OpenSea integration. Thanks. Yeah.
00:47:23.476 - 00:47:51.650, Speaker A: You want to show the OpenSea integration, Sneh? Yeah, sure. It's just Zoom is giving me some issues. Sorry. All right, no worries. I think we do have it in designs if you want to show I think I cannot share my screen after give some no worries. Can you send me the Openc link, or could you send it on Zoom for people to view? I think that will be helpful. Yeah, for sure.
00:47:51.650 - 00:48:40.672, Speaker A: Cool project. My first feedback is I really hate the term loot box. I would change it, definitely change it to something else. Call it, I don't know, Puzzle Box, I don't know Puzzle Pieces or whatever, but I think loot box is a really bad name. Other than that, I think the concept is pretty cool. One question I have is how's the randomness generated for the loot boxes, right? So we use VRFs chain links, VRFs. So it basically returns us a random number and we slice it for one number.
00:48:40.672 - 00:49:29.430, Speaker A: So we basically use it to index over the pieces. So, yeah, to keep it short, we basically use chain link VRFs. Okay, cool. And it's polygon supported, so we've integrated polygon right now and we've also been able to deploy it on scale and arbitram, but primarily we've integrated with polygon. Cool. So there's 25 pieces per puzzle and that's a standard. Do you know how many average trades it takes for one user to complete a puzzle, given the pieces that they're given per box? So right now, we have hard coded it to 25.
00:49:29.430 - 00:50:08.066, Speaker A: But when we actually finally launch it, they're going to be puzzles of different sizes. So there would be easy puzzles, and then they're going to be like difficult puzzles. Which are going to be of more value because they would be harder to solve. Like ten x ten four x four and multiple like that. Just to give you an average. Like yesterday I was trying to solve a five x five with four ongoing five x five and it took me a blurry, like four or five batch purchases to actually get all the pieces, but I still couldn't do it. And because there was just one last piece, I was not able to get it.
00:50:08.066 - 00:50:32.890, Speaker A: So it's really hard to play. So that is actually how we plan to leverage the marketplace because people are going to run into this problem where they're going to be super frustrated. I just need this one piece. So they'll be like, OK, bro, I'm just going to put up a listing on the marketplace for cool. Sorry. Go ahead, Andrew. Go ahead.
00:50:32.890 - 00:51:26.718, Speaker A: I was going to say it seems like there's variations on what I would typically think of as puzzle solving that sort of go into this. Now, you typically get a puzzle where you know all the pieces are in the puzzle. But now there's sort of a question in this model of like so you have a puzzle to solve, but you don't even know if you have to acquire the pieces that you think are going to be in the help you solve the puzzle. So that's interesting. Yes. In fact, my question and more direction I wanted to brainstorm with you guys was the economics. So who you think that your users are and do you want to keep it just for gamer, like on a gamifying approach or there are some economics behind it and maybe, I don't know, very hard to think that both could do it.
00:51:26.718 - 00:52:10.938, Speaker A: But anyway, so who would be your audience? Is it just the game or it could be something it got it. So we haven't put too much thought into it yet. But we've been in talks with So Karthik the other day, connected us to Coin artist and we were discussing it with her and she actually suggested that we collab with some digital, some NFT artists so that we can bring real value into those puzzle pieces. So we might go that route. But yeah, so we are passively thinking about that stuff. But for now we just wanted to deliver on the hackathon. Right.
00:52:10.938 - 00:53:13.566, Speaker A: And she said she has some collaborations that she can put us into so we're excited about that. But I guess for the hackathon launch we are looking at memes or something funny which people find interesting to own and yeah, that's going to be the short term goal. So we'd actually appreciate ideas there like for the hackathon what sort of puzzles we can go for. So we're thinking of going with some artistic modified version of the sponsor logos and maybe some funny memes, maybe like Vitalik's Head or something entertaining in that aspect. So we'd love ideas there as well. I'm interested in this because I think that it gives you the opportunity to not only set up your revenue streams but you get to sort of control for the difficulty like the number of times somebody's going to have to trade based on the pieces that they're given. You can sort of control that in a lot of ways, I would say over the course.
00:53:13.566 - 00:53:58.294, Speaker A: If you decide to spin this up after the hackathon do a lot of averaging of what each player has to go through. The number of transactions they have to deal with in order to finish the puzzle, the number of boxes they have to purchase themselves in order to gain the pieces, who they need to trade with, and then sort of ratchet up the difficulty for those expert level puzzles. Because I think you have the chance to really get people to go crazy about that. But it's going to be an important balance between having that one last piece that's an incentive and then having that one last piece that gets people to walk away. So there's a little bit of game design included here that's going to be necessary to make sure that the difficulty level keeps people interested and doesn't turn them away. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, definitely helpful.
00:53:58.294 - 00:54:06.320, Speaker A: Thank you so much for that. Super fun though. I really like where you're headed. This is cool. I like this one you showed. Thank you so much guys. Thank you so much.
00:54:06.320 - 00:54:55.280, Speaker A: Cool. So if I'm not taking too much time, I just had one last question. Yeah please. Any insights, any ideas as to how we can make this more appealing to the users? So we recently we had a call with somebody from Polygon and they suggested us to look into ideas or figure things out to make it more attractive or more entertaining for the user because maybe people aren't interested in playing the game so they're like maybe think of something to attract or bring in more users. Let me ask a question just out of curiosity. Are you guys puzzle enthusiasts yourselves before this? Not really. Yeah.
00:54:55.280 - 00:55:37.086, Speaker A: Maybe you just want to look into that like, what are puzzle enthusiasts currently? Where do they gather, what interests them? And now you're sort of getting into that psychology a little bit. Some people just love doing puzzles. It's been huge during the pandemic here in the US. Like, tons of people are doing puzzles. It's not a direct line, but to understand that psychology a little bit could probably be useful. To be honest, I was not a puzle person, but yesterday when I was trying to solve, it was really fun because it was really to sorry, go on. No, please, go ahead, go ahead.
00:55:37.086 - 00:56:39.342, Speaker A: Danish? Yeah, I was just adding that we're just trying to address the average Joe user as well, like somebody who would want to invest into an NFT or maybe for trading purposes. We also want to address that audience and not just puzzle enthusiasts. So we want to keep it as generic and as wide as possible. Yeah, it's a good choice. Otherwise you really channel and funnel too much the audience. Maybe you could I don't know, I'm thinking about recurring, as you mentioned, like collaborations with artists so that you know that on a zillion of basis, whatever, there is something valuable. Like there is something that you can actually there is a market and you can build a little bit of buzz about around it and say once a week, once a month, you have one piece around the boxes that if you really get it in, you have maybe an history so that people can say, okay, something very valuable.
00:56:39.342 - 00:57:22.638, Speaker A: It was one of the puzzle that this person actually solved and he suddenly have a bunch of money, right, because that's the value behind it and you're able to sell it. So it doesn't have to be always the case, but maybe some recurring collaborations, that piece that it's a little bit more recognizable from a larger audience that keeps the engagement, right. It's never dormant, in a sense. Awesome. Thank you so much. In the interest of time, I'll wrap it up. Thank you so much, guys.
00:57:22.638 - 00:57:46.322, Speaker A: All right, thanks guys. Good luck with that. Okay, so ticket share as our last project. Ticket share. Thank you guys. Last but not least, let me share my screen. Can you guys all see it? Yes.
00:57:46.322 - 00:58:50.890, Speaker A: Oh, great. So let me start off by asking you a question. What do Facebook, LinkedIn, Ebay, Axie all have in common? They have a strong network effect, so each additional user to the platform would bring marginal value to the platform. But we all know that it's extremely difficult to build the initial user base. And what we are trying to do here is trying to help platforms or any companies to build up their initial user base by deploying a Network Effect Judgment affiliate marketing program. So what do I mean by network effect jipment program. So let me just give you an overview of the current system that companies use to attract promote products.
00:58:50.890 - 00:59:44.060, Speaker A: So in the current system. So let's say they would give incentive to users like you and me if we are already using the products or services let's say hey we will give you $10 if you refer someone to our platform or use our products. So it's kind of like one time deal and that's it. Once you get that $10 by sending a referral link to your friend that's it, it's done. The incentive system is not strong enough in the current system. So what we are proposing is a strong adequate economic incentive powered by blockchain. So you would not, let's say Andrew, you send a referral link to, right? And then Nicola buys the product.
00:59:44.060 - 01:00:36.166, Speaker A: And you would get, let's say you get one token for inviting Nicola to use the service. And then Nicola say hey, that's a great product, let me invite my other friends. And then Nicola invite, let's say Gabrielle. And then Gabrielle also buy in this case, not only Nicola gets one token for the reward. And Andrew, you also get 0.5 token for reward because you bring in Nicola and Nicola bring in Gabrielle. So it keeps extending out to higher levels as your referrals bring other friends and the other friends bring more referrals and you can see we have a table here depending on how far you are away from your referral.
01:00:36.166 - 01:01:37.082, Speaker A: If you're one level away from your referral you get 0.5 token, two levels away you get half of the 0.5 token, you get zero point 25 tokens and so on. So that's the incentive system we are trying to build in our affiliate marketing program and it has a very strong economic incentive. So for our use case we are building a ticketing platform employing what we just described. So on a traditional ticketing platform event hosts would create events and then they hire promoters to promote the events and the promoter would get commission back if their audience buy the tickets and attend the events. So using our new affiliate program the event host can provide adequate economic incentive to turn any ticket buyers into promoters.
01:01:37.082 - 01:02:35.170, Speaker A: So basically, if you buy a ticket going to the event that you like, because of the infinite reward that you would get, you would like to invite your friends and hoping your friends will invite other friends. So you have incentive. You want to get as many people possible to attend the meeting, attend the event. And here's the high level overview of the architecture, what we are trying to do on the ticketing platform. So we're going to use ERC 1155 token contract for the platform to distribute the promotion reward. I'm sorry, I made a mistake here. It should be ERC 20 tokens to distribute the reward and then ERC 1155 to represent the ticket itself for each event, each ticket.
01:02:35.170 - 01:04:12.050, Speaker A: And then we also have the event registration contract that manage all the events being that is active, that are not active last but not least we have the promoter reward checking contract that basically would check the reward distribution we just described. So we will use Scal as the L two scaling solution plus a user friendly interface made possible by Taurus. So Yusuf, would you like to do the I cannot share my so? Yeah, so here's the page. When the user goes to the ticket share page, they will need to connect to a wallet and be connecting to the Maramas. And then if you are event host that wants to create an event, you can register event and enter the name and then select the date of the event that starts and then the time, and then the location, and then the price of the ticket and how much. And then the number of tickets that are variable for this event. And then you can register.
01:04:12.050 - 01:05:25.466, Speaker A: Is it working? Maybe the price is negative. Oh, thanks, I should add a validation for that one and confirm. And here is the event. And then you can create referral links and this will generate a referral link so you can share with your friends and then you can earn some tokens and then you can click on this to copy the link. And then I will switch to another wallet address and then paste and then connect the wallet again. Now this will be the friends and then when they purchase a ticket, the referral will get the tokens. So if I switch it back and then refresh and this person earns ten tokens for now and yeah, that's it.
01:05:25.466 - 01:06:00.394, Speaker A: Yeah. We're still building out the band to keep track of the degree for distributing the token based on how far you are away from the referrals. Well, I'm impressed in a sense. Very neat. Good presentation, I would say. Clear ideas, clear use cases. I'm a huge fan of network effects with crypto economics.
01:06:00.394 - 01:06:51.010, Speaker A: Probably the strongest success factor of blockchain now, but especially in the future when it will enable really like people from all over the world to be part of the ecosystem that would have never thought about it. So the ticketing makes sense. I'm also trying to think on different use cases beside obviously the gaming. Like you can't gamify the system, I think also civil attacks would be a problem. So you need to have the economics, right? You need to pay to have the tickets. Yes. So the ticket is definitely suitable.
01:06:51.010 - 01:07:41.602, Speaker A: As an example, have you thought about any other use case that could be fitting the reward system? Yes. So we have a discussion with the mentors from scale and what the mentor suggested. We can look into the coupon distributing system. Like if you help distribute coupon or you invite people to buy a product from buy a product using a services, you will also get reward. And then the person that you introduce to the system introduce another person and the person one would keep getting the reward as the connection. Keep expanding. Yeah.
01:07:41.602 - 01:08:21.410, Speaker A: I'm thinking like any platform. Right. Also DeFi platform, say, I don't know if any liquidity provider you find a way to track debt and you introduce you can split a part of the rewards that he gets, in a sense. Exactly. Fork it that way all the way back. Yes. I see a lot of integration or a lot of use cases that could be applicable.
01:08:21.410 - 01:08:57.410, Speaker A: And how do you see it? You see like, a layer on top of it needs to be on scale at this point. Right. Everything needs to be on scale or would work also back and forth from the base chain. And the solution in L two. Yusong. Would you like to take a step at this question? It's going to be on scale. They have, like, gas transaction for the gas fee.
01:08:57.410 - 01:09:29.910, Speaker A: There's no gas fee on scale. Yeah. Okay. So, Nicola, I think if this idea works out, we can build a layer two solution, a protocol for everyone to use. And I have done the market research. There's actually a blockchain company out there called Key Two or two key that's already doing similar services out there. They have their protocol, they offer layer two solution.
01:09:29.910 - 01:10:07.220, Speaker A: Cool. I agree. If the economics are sort of sorted, which I don't have the ability to think through, but it sounds like you're thinking through. There's some good examples out there already. It's interesting to do it in the ticketing space. Is key two that other company doing it in the ticketing space, or is it just it's for general purpose for everyone? Almost for everyone who's trying to promote their products and services. Let me see if key Two or two key.
01:10:07.220 - 01:10:50.770, Speaker A: Yeah. Hooky Network, I think. I think we saw it, actually. Cool. Any any suggestion for anyone? We really welcome any ideas and feedback and really appreciate, Nicola, your ideas, and Andrews, too. Thank you. Well, all I would say, outside of a material idea of use is to think a little bit about how you present for the judging session.
01:10:50.770 - 01:11:45.140, Speaker A: It looks like you have a crisp sort of presentation almost there, and you have good stuff to walk through. Remember, it's like a two to four minute video, so you want to sort of hit it well. And the thing I would say is, again, this is not a technical thing. It's just for the presentation, for the demo, whatever. If it's ticketing, then present the problem and make something I don't want to something about the ticket itself, like you're the average user, like the use case, like going to a concert show, something like that. Or just to sort of hook people in a little bit at the start and then go through the technical and sort of the economics as you've thought it through. Got it.
01:11:45.140 - 01:12:48.326, Speaker A: I think. Thank you. Yes. I was thinking through because there are all a universe, not even a planet, like a universe of DeFi applications that you could bring on, but it depends if you do on application specific. So I'm thinking about, for example, insurance, right? Like if you could track recurring insurance and you could see you can have a recurring reward dolling out to you because you introduced somebody that got one month of insurance, then I got two months of insurance, then three months of insurance. So you can also think about a ticket. It's like one event, right? So it's multidimensional in my mind, maybe it's a bit late, so my mind is messed up.
01:12:48.326 - 01:13:41.158, Speaker A: But you can have one dimension, which is one event, multiple people, but you can also have multiple events and also the same people, or it's multidimensional. So let's say a product like an insurance that it doesn't really matter. It matters if you get more people. But maybe they want to insure a limited number of protocols, right? But you could change the dimension and get it like a system that rewards you every time that they reinsure, in a sense. Right, so something recurring. So every time the user that you introduced is using the product, you get something. Right.
01:13:41.158 - 01:14:24.150, Speaker A: So that could be also a sort of dimension. I don't know if it works as well because it's different from the tickets. Tickets is one event, multiple people. But my point is that you maybe want to think about you don't want to lose the referral link once you have it. Right? So it goes from people to people and it's like a tree, right? Like you get always from the region. You get whoever goes, you get a little piece of the token. But you can also maybe think to apply to services and that would be extremely valuable.
01:14:24.150 - 01:15:07.522, Speaker A: I see your point. I think you're touching upon on the rewarding the for the recurring purchases. That their referral. Yeah. And since Liquidity in DeFi, especially in DeFi is well, this is on a scale, so that's also another thing to think about it. But since liquidity is a product, believe it or not, right now in DeFi, it's a really big addressable market for you right now. It could be, so I wouldn't discriminate in a sense like keep your options open.
01:15:07.522 - 01:15:32.906, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Thank you. But good job so far. Absolutely, thanks. And I see Azi has an idea. Feel free to unmute Azzie as ink's hand. Yes.
01:15:32.906 - 01:16:29.690, Speaker A: Okay. So the idea with that one would be well, I have an idea that goes along kind of with that. Basically it's an open VPN you can download and install on your server or any server anywhere, like a container. And then from there with the ticket system, that the coin be delivered to the VPN holder and it's an open VPN so that the user would get a link and share his link to the server and get points or whatever every time they're using it for a certain amount of time and that's locked in. So then the user. Doesn't have to pay anything for VPN. Server is the one that's collecting the point by putting hosting server.
01:16:29.690 - 01:17:20.574, Speaker A: So the ticketing system is like, say I'm an end user and I connect to the server in Hawaii or wherever. At that point, I share my link with someone else, and that's trackable and payable. That's how it's I think there was something very good on it, for sure. I think we got maybe 35, 40% of it. I mean, at least on my hand, it was a little bit no, the audio was a little problematic, but everybody feels like there's something there. Storage, right? Yeah, storage. Yeah, it was mentioning VPN or storage as well.
01:17:20.574 - 01:17:56.540, Speaker A: I heard that. Ryan, can you reach out to Inc? Yes, I just did. Ezzy, can you share your discord so I can DM you? I think he was there a second ago. Yeah, no, he's still here. Okay. All right, well, thanks for presenting and sharing. That sounds interesting.
