00:00:10.170 - 00:01:41.866, Speaker A: Good evening, Tokyo. How's it going? Are you all excited? Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the clothing ceremony for ETH Global Tokyo. My name is Cartigma, the co founders of ETH Global and can't wait to get this started. This event has been phenomenal. For the next one and a half hours, we're going to be making you clap a lot. And I can just see this room behind me packed, so I hope you can hear me in the back. 1500 attendees are here in this building, out of which almost 1100 of them have been hacking for the last 36 hours.
00:01:41.866 - 00:02:04.370, Speaker A: And they're here from 59 different countries. And the best part of it all is that 35% of them are brand new to Web three. These are existing engineers trying to understand what's possible in crypto. 400 of these are Japanese, and 70% of everybody in this room is from Asia. This is amazing. Give yourselves a big round of applause. Our biggest and our first event in Asia.
00:02:04.370 - 00:02:35.870, Speaker A: Now, this is not a conference. This whole event is a hackathon. And that means if you're at any global event, that is a weekend hackathon. We care about onboarding developers into this ecosystem and we do this by focusing on three key things. Want to bring all builders together. Our goal is to help you learn, get help, and grow and upskill yourselves. And we really believe that showing is more important than telling, which means that everything we're going to see today is going to be a live demo and not just a PowerPoint.
00:02:35.870 - 00:03:25.514, Speaker A: So let's go back to the hackathon. I know all of you have been super tired from working on amazing projects. And I'm super excited to announce that after submissions were due, we had 311 amazing projects that came out of this event. That is absolutely mind blowing. That is a lot of projects in this space, and we're going to showcase some of them just in a few minutes. Before we get to all of that, I want to give a few thanks to a lot of the people that made all this possible. Most importantly, all of our judges who have been looking at hundreds of products over the last four or 5 hours, giving all of you feedback, giving all of you pointers onto how to make this better, how do you take this to the next level and just helping you improve and make this more successful post this weekend? So please give a big round of applause to all of our amazing judges.
00:03:25.514 - 00:03:59.702, Speaker A: I want to thank Ken, Vera, Denison, Deep Min, Richard James, Joanne John Jeff, tom Lasse, Makoto Windra, Jack Masa, Tomo Flyon, Stani Austin, Paris and Toma heroes. They've been incredible here talking to all of you and we can't thank them enough for all of this. More importantly oh, there's more. Chris jade. Madeline. I was surprised that this is not 28, but more importantly, 38 incredible partners that are here that are giving all these amazing prizes and have made this event possible. So we're going to keep clapping and the faster you clap, the faster I'll try to say all these names.
00:03:59.702 - 00:04:49.906, Speaker A: So without further ado, let's roll.

I'm going to be talking about all the prizes that you're going to win from each of these companies. So let's go back to the 311 projects. 09:00 A.m.. All these projects were submitted from 930 till 01:00 P.m.. We looked and judged all of these projects here in this floor and also upstairs from this, we came up with eleven finalist teams.
00:04:49.906 - 00:05:28.082, Speaker A: What's going to happen now is that these teams are going to come on stage and they're going to demo what they built to all of you. And we're going to see some really cool things that we're excited about and some interesting and impressive trends that we're going to see and we have been seeing in the space. There's going to be a lot of interesting and recording themes that we probably saw a lot of workshops on today over the weekend and people talked about and just ideas that were discussed. So we're going to get all of that going. And without further ado, when I announce all of our eleven finalists, so please give a big round of applause to our eleven teams. Pumpboarding ZK Voiski bailout Aoki app octoflora Mina Probably nothing works. Hay swap Tanuki Yoru and Superplay.
00:05:28.082 - 00:06:01.162, Speaker A: All eleven of these teams will come on one by one and demo what they built. Now, before we get to our very first demo, I want to take a quick second to thank 300 amazing teams here. I'll move out of the way so you can take a photo. Just because you were not one of these eleven teams, it does not mean you were not good enough. It does not mean there was something wrong. Our goal with the judging process was to highlight really awesome and interesting themes. There's more interesting ideas and projects that everybody was excited about in this space, especially our judges.
00:06:01.162 - 00:06:37.830, Speaker A: And we really want to make sure that all of you are not discouraged from working on your project after today. And we are here to help. We are here to help you connect with anybody you want to know or get feedback or just be introduced to anybody, whether it's our judges or some mentor or some other person in this ecosystem. Please take the time to reach out to us and ask for any help that you need and we'll be able to make sure that we can get you there. On top of all of that, this is being live streamed. So for anybody joining us online or if you're on your phones, you can head over to efglobal.com showcase and see all 311 of these projects.
00:06:37.830 - 00:07:00.770, Speaker A: Now they're all public and you can check out everything you're going to see here and a lot more about how they built it, why they built it, and their source code. So I'm going to stop talking. Let's get our very first demo for this afternoon. Please welcome. Introduce yourself. Hey, everyone, I'm Zach.
00:07:01.190 - 00:07:03.966, Speaker B: I'm Mia, and we build palm boarding.
00:07:04.158 - 00:07:14.098, Speaker A: Palm stands for proof of membership protocol, and our goal is to allow any community of any size to be able to decentralize themselves without having to rely on any centralized authority.
00:07:14.274 - 00:07:14.662, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:14.716 - 00:07:22.872, Speaker A: Let's get started. You'll notice right off the gate that we're using email for authentication over connect.
00:07:22.926 - 00:07:23.720, Speaker C: Wallet.
00:07:28.770 - 00:07:31.520, Speaker A: Behind the scenes. This is generating an Ethereum address.
00:07:40.440 - 00:07:40.900, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:07:40.970 - 00:07:46.820, Speaker A: It just verified that I don't belong to a specific community, and now I'm going through the onboarding flow.
00:07:49.840 - 00:07:50.700, Speaker C: Sweet.
00:08:29.340 - 00:08:54.910, Speaker B: As you can tell, this is in a type form format, so it's very easy for anyone who doesn't have crypto background to still be able to onboard their community. And right now, the emails that are being written here, it looks like you're just inviting other admins to this platform. But in the background, we're actually creating a multisig for this community.
00:08:56.000 - 00:08:56.412, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:56.466 - 00:09:35.640, Speaker A: And with that multi SIG, you have some basic permissions on top, including who to allow to add and remove members after the multisig is made. And how do you add other admins to the Platform? Our default is majority approval. Sweet. And onboarding is really the main focus we had for the hackathon right now. As I finished up, a multisig was created with me as the sole owner on SafeCore, and there are two unconfirmed admins that are able to join the Platform. As the admins join, I will get a notification through Push and then be able to come back to the Platform in order to onboard them, too.
00:09:37.370 - 00:09:54.350, Speaker B: We wanted to create an experience that would allow anyone, especially those who are in the Web Two ecosystem, to be able to onboard into Web three again without any crypto knowledge so that we can onboard the next billion communities onto Ethereum and other Web Three ecosystems.
00:09:56.210 - 00:09:57.200, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:10:02.710 - 00:10:12.930, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you for our very first demo. Next up on my right is ZK Voicekey. So please give the ZK Voicekey team a big round of applause.
00:10:17.610 - 00:11:06.754, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. So we would like to introduce Jika Borsky. It allows you to create a unique Ethelium account just using your voice. So it is very useful for well used kind of key problems of ethalium. So when we use it for the key liquid system, even if you lose your private key and you don't have social recovery and you don't have any spare private key, you can recover this one using your voice. And when we use it for the onchain two factor authentication. The smart contract will require you to speak some special words when you do some special action on chain.
00:11:06.754 - 00:12:07.370, Speaker C: For example, transforming a large amount of ether. So in this model, basically we have a registration process and authentication process. In the registration, a user generates the hash value derived from the user's voice and store it on the Si M blockchain. And in the authentication process, a user proves that the user knows the voice data which is corresponding to the published hash value. So in more detail, it has three technical features. First, it extracts speakers feature vectors from your voice using machine learnings. And second, we use del nurse blues to protect the privacy of this authentication process because if you rebuild all data in this authentication, your voice feature will be reviewed to the public.
00:12:07.370 - 00:12:41.380, Speaker C: So we have to protect this privacy using GCP. And third, basically the voice data, the human data, like voice data, is valuable even for the same person. So our system cancel this noise of data using fuzzy commitment. So even if your browse has some errors from the reference data, we can extract the same hash value using fuzzy commitment. So let's show your demo.
00:12:43.270 - 00:13:09.466, Speaker A: Okay, thank you everyone. I'm really honored to stand here and let me do that quick demo. So this is our application. So what we have to do to recover the key is first we should register our voice. Okay, so what you have to do is just to talk to this UI. Okay? We only have 5 seconds, so watch out. The sun is shining and the birds are singing.
00:13:09.578 - 00:13:10.990, Speaker C: Oh, I mistake.
00:13:13.890 - 00:13:27.460, Speaker A: Okay, so from my mistake in voice, commitment was created and after that, MetaMask should open. What's up?
00:13:33.760 - 00:13:34.510, Speaker C: Wow.
00:13:37.600 - 00:14:17.676, Speaker A: Okay, so MetaMask should open but not opening. Okay, so when we cover the let's think that Bob. I'm Bob, but I forgot the secret ethereum address key. So yeah, I have to recover. So what I have to do here, we can try again. It's okay, let's start from again beginning. Yeah.
00:14:17.676 - 00:14:18.732, Speaker A: Okay, try to get it working.
00:14:18.786 - 00:14:19.756, Speaker C: Let's start.
00:14:19.938 - 00:14:22.700, Speaker A: The sun is shining and the birds are singing.
00:14:25.580 - 00:14:29.690, Speaker C: Okay, thank you.
00:14:30.880 - 00:14:36.780, Speaker A: I was really upgrade. Okay, so now it's sent to Eservium.
00:14:37.760 - 00:14:40.544, Speaker C: And have to wait. And I cannot wait.
00:14:40.582 - 00:14:41.890, Speaker A: So I will speed up.
00:14:46.600 - 00:14:48.948, Speaker C: Okay, got it.
00:14:49.034 - 00:14:55.700, Speaker A: So now the voice is registered. Okay, but now next is important. Okay, we switch to Bob.
00:14:55.860 - 00:14:57.850, Speaker C: No, before that.
00:14:59.980 - 00:15:03.860, Speaker A: Okay, now I'm not the owner.
00:15:03.940 - 00:15:04.232, Speaker C: Okay.
00:15:04.286 - 00:15:19.204, Speaker A: I forgot the address. So I'm not the owner of this address, but the commitment exists. So this is not the voice feature body itself, but kind of hashed and commitment. So it's safe to save this on chain. And this is saved on chain. Okay, so let's start to recover.
00:15:19.272 - 00:15:21.490, Speaker C: And what I have to do is to speak again.
00:15:22.260 - 00:15:25.520, Speaker A: The sun is shining and the birds are singing.
00:15:26.260 - 00:15:34.464, Speaker C: Okay, hope it works well. Okay, so this is the commitment that's.
00:15:34.512 - 00:15:56.596, Speaker A: Deployed on the on chain. And this is the recovered. So from the voice, I could recover the commitment. Actually, it's created ZKP, but it takes five or ten minutes. So yeah, this time I will skip doing this. And now I succeeded to recover and I am the owner of this contract address yeah. For the demo.
00:15:56.596 - 00:15:57.180, Speaker A: That's it.
00:15:57.250 - 00:15:58.030, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:16:00.480 - 00:16:13.432, Speaker A: Awesome. I can't wait to see 50 more interesting use cases of this. I think there's something more. Please. Thank you.
00:16:13.506 - 00:16:14.450, Speaker C: Thank you, everyone.
00:16:15.140 - 00:16:20.240, Speaker A: Next up, we have our third demo, and that is project bailout. Please give him a big round of applause.
00:16:24.330 - 00:16:26.338, Speaker C: Hey, guys, I'm James.
00:16:26.514 - 00:16:30.710, Speaker A: I'm Ikuro. I'm Akira.
00:16:33.130 - 00:17:11.140, Speaker C: We are bailout. We build our wallet security pipeline between EOA smart contract wallet and cold wallet and two FAA smart contract wallet which can be signed by EOA and Google account. And using bailout, you can use MetaMask mainly and put your main asset on smart contract wallet and eject your asset all asset to call wallet with a single button when something happens, like losing your private keys or devices. Okay, so let me take a demo.
00:17:12.890 - 00:17:13.350, Speaker A: First.
00:17:13.420 - 00:18:32.160, Speaker C: You can see your UA address and balances here, and there are several setup panels below, and the social recovery setup is currently a bit hard coded. Okay, let's go. So now place the two FA setup button and sign in with your google account and then execute our lead action to mint lead protocol PKPS to your MPC wallet and sign to create a smart contract wallet and set up the EOA address and MPC wallet as a Signus. And wait a moment and check the address. Yeah. It's. Yeah, sign again.
00:18:32.160 - 00:19:01.360, Speaker C: It's trying again. Yeah. Now the contract void is deployed and this is your contract void. It's setting the two FA signed by your google account and UA account and then now setting up your social recovery. So set the contract wallet and deploying your lead action to IPFS.
00:19:07.190 - 00:19:08.834, Speaker A: And then you should set up your.
00:19:08.872 - 00:19:27.240, Speaker C: Publication ID for lens protocol for the social recovery and set your social recovery address to be evacuated by your smart contract wallet and set up the social.
00:19:27.310 - 00:19:28.200, Speaker A: Recovery.
00:19:33.710 - 00:20:45.830, Speaker C: And switch to the network and sign. It also meeting the lit PKPS and set up your social recovery address and other status on the smart contract and check the status. Okay, this is your social recovery address, prover address and social recovery escape address sitting on the contract. And then you should send some money for gas fee to your social recovery approval. And this is your social recovery wall goddess. Now plus is zero and execute the social recovery in one click. And this execute function can be executed by any other void address without the gas fees.
00:20:45.830 - 00:21:13.290, Speaker C: Wait for. Okay, so the blanks of the smart contract void is transferred to your social recovery work address.
00:21:15.200 - 00:21:19.260, Speaker A: Thank you. And this is your smart contract work address.
00:21:19.330 - 00:21:29.710, Speaker C: And the balance is now zero and the social recovery function, it was executed. That's all. Thank you guys.
00:21:34.560 - 00:21:49.780, Speaker A: It amazing. Thank you. All right, next up is Aoki app NFT. And we're going to go with a translation here. So this one will be a slightly long demo, but trust me, it'll be worth it. So, without further ado, let's welcome everybody on stage.
00:21:54.940 - 00:22:32.870, Speaker C: Hello, I'm aoki in auki app. I introduce my project Aokiap NFT. In recent years, generative NFT become very popular. In particular, NFT with stacking layers are mainstream. But I think this is not technically challenging. I think on chain NFT is a technical challenge, but on chain NFD has many gas costs, so and so.
00:22:36.360 - 00:22:36.676, Speaker B: The.
00:22:36.698 - 00:23:21.730, Speaker C: Way of expression will limit it. So I propose so I propose image compression method based on principal component analysis and applied our knowledge of linear algebra and compress obersan JPEG and the picture is become Sft so user can buy a vector experience. So let's go demo.
00:23:26.280 - 00:23:33.880, Speaker A: So I'll try my best to translate. So please look at the images.
00:23:40.780 - 00:23:42.792, Speaker C: So, what she's doing right now is.
00:23:42.846 - 00:24:04.700, Speaker A: Prior to that, she actually took 15,000 selfie images as a kind of sample data and based on that she run the Python basic compression mechanism to compress it into 32 different elements. And based on that you can basically manufacture 256 powered by 32 element which is almost infinite number of expression.
00:24:04.780 - 00:24:06.128, Speaker C: So what she's doing right now in.
00:24:06.134 - 00:24:13.684, Speaker A: The first element is just showing the different wearable lighting, but all can be expressed as part of NFT and this.
00:24:13.722 - 00:24:32.936, Speaker C: Second one is actually showing each kind of toggle of the 32 elements which you can kind of toggle all the way to 256. So not only just the lighting, she can also make some expression changes like blinking and it's not like she can open mouse and stuff, but you can.
00:24:32.958 - 00:24:38.780, Speaker A: Do more subtle expression changes or be as a generative NFT.
00:24:40.720 - 00:24:43.100, Speaker C: This is eye blinking parameter.
00:24:56.890 - 00:25:14.670, Speaker A: Being able to represent all of that directly on chain as compressed vectors, that's just awesome. And this is on main net or on chain, not on layer twos. So please give another round of applause to that project. And next up we have Oxo. So please welcome them on stage.
00:25:17.970 - 00:25:55.290, Speaker C: Hello everyone. How many of you are new to web three? Please raise your hand quickly. I think it looks like everyone is experienced anyway. So we build an AiPower blockchain explorer with human readable answers called optoplora. So block query made easy is our lovely slogan. So I'm sure that in web three you probably heard of people usually say the data is actually all there on the blockchain, everybody can see it. But have you ever wondered how easy or how difficult it is to actually query multiple data simultaneously on the blockchain? Whether it's ethereum polygon, the answer is actually very difficult.
00:25:55.290 - 00:26:09.434, Speaker C: Right, so we have built a natural language query powered by chat TBT and we basically put the results in really comprehensible format. That very easy for human to understand. So we'll go over the technology architecture.
00:26:09.562 - 00:27:00.314, Speaker A: Yeah, so the kind of magic that's behind all this is two layers of LLMs. And so the first layer is an Agent layer and the role of the Agent layer really is to from a natural language query decide which LLM to use. And so the second layer is basically a bunch of models and we've supported Lens Protocol and airstack in our kind of MVP here today. But basically you can accept any number of different LLMs whose job is to translate a natural language query into a GraphQL query. And so you can imagine that since as a community, we've kind of adopted GraphQL as a very common protocol, that we can go and plug this in to many, many more models that are all trained to generate GraphQL queries based on certain schemas. And the agent will help us decide kind of which one to use, given a certain natural language input. And so there's also a second layer where we have a renderer.
00:27:00.314 - 00:27:16.260, Speaker A: And because we don't really know exactly what the query is going to return us, we actually have to go and build out a mapping of all the entities that are possible and build a renderer on the front end to decide, okay, this is actually the data that we've gotten. This is how we want to show it to the user. And so we'll go into our demo now.
00:27:18.310 - 00:27:26.790, Speaker C: Okay, so the first query that we will do okay, let's go with the show me the NFT pictures on Ethereum held by Paradigm East please.
00:27:26.860 - 00:27:49.726, Speaker A: So this takes a bit of time because again there's these three big steps. So the first thing that happens is that you have the agent that looks at this query and says okay, which model should I use? Then it forwards along that query with a bunch of other information in order to actually generate the GraphQL query. And lastly we actually make the GraphQL request to the GraphQL API and generate and get the response back. That you can see here, you can.
00:27:49.748 - 00:28:42.446, Speaker C: See this is all the images owned by Paradigm Es. So quite an interesting collection of image. Now let's go to our second query which is this time we'll deal with collection stats. So basically we want to fight down the aggregate collection stat in monthly sales, monthly volume. Also for the currency NFT collection, it was a very famous piece made by Damien Hurst, very well known artist, also in web two, web three world, the collection address is so as you can see, we can actually see the chart here. On the vertical axis is the average sales price in USDC and on the horizontal axis is actually the progression of the price, right, since the minting of the collection until the present date. So it hasn't been doing so well because we're in the bear market, right? And you can actually also see the table here for all the raw data that we put in.
00:28:42.446 - 00:29:18.060, Speaker C: Nicely format and we can actually send this via push. Very easy to do. So we'll send it to my teammate wallet address right there. So he will input it in, send the message and yeah, it will arrive to his wallet after we approve this transaction. It's just as easy as that, thanks to our sponsor too. And next let's look at the third query, find the top ten lens profile and then return their ID, their handle, their name and the number of followers. Sorted by the number of followers basically.
00:29:18.060 - 00:29:19.210, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:19.280 - 00:29:30.640, Speaker A: So in this actual bottom component that you see here, what we're actually doing is it's actually the same component that we're using and all it's doing is it's actually looking at the response that we get, parsing it and deciding how to render it.
00:29:31.170 - 00:30:06.138, Speaker C: Then as you can see, the chat and the table is probably easier to see here. Lens Robotogo is obviously number one on there, stanny is number two with 85,000 follower, very popular and yeah, the top ten. So as you can see and now let's switch back. So that was our brief demo. Quickly talk about the tech stack that we view. We mainly use a lot of open source libraries and software chat, TVT, Lang, chain react, JS but we actually explicitly would like to thank our sponsor for push protocol, for enabling the messaging air stack and Lens protocol. Without them obviously we wouldn't have the data to show.
00:30:06.138 - 00:31:05.834, Speaker C: And then some of our roadmaps that I would like to talk about, obviously 36 hours, there's only so much that we can do, right? But ideally in the future we'd love to gather more training data to improve the model accuracy and then expand the use cases and also adding in aggregation. So you can actually do a lot of interesting math like some averages, improve visualization of result in a dynamic way and then expand more data sources as well through multiple different protocols and then raise funding and go to market and make it happen. And this is the team that make it happen. We have a product designer, Andre, unfortunately not here at the moment, the smart contract developer Felix over there. Myself, I'm the product manager. Ulisi Key and Wilson Lowe are two expert full stack developer so we hope to with this simple yet easy to use app to be able to help onboard Web Three user who are new to the Web Three sphere but also would be useful for data geeks who love to explore data with their Web Three journey. And that's it.
00:31:05.834 - 00:31:06.620, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:31:10.270 - 00:31:28.390, Speaker A: Awesome. Blockchain and AI have finally started to merge together. Other that's going to be fun. All right, next up is Project Minod. It's going to be a really cool hardware hack, so we're going to have to spend 30 more seconds on a little bit more setup and we'll have the camera zoom in when we get to the hardware part, please give them a big round of applause.
00:31:33.130 - 00:32:07.790, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. My name is Dan, and I'm here with my teammates and good friends, Hideoshi and Hiroyoki. Today we'd like to share a hackathon project called Mina. I'd like to open up the question. What if we told you that more than 60% to 70% of the Japanese residents already have a hardware wallet? The answer is yes, it's true. They just don't know it yet. So, Minor is a project and Minor is a browser wallet specifically for Japanese residents that lets them use a government issued ID as a hardware wallet to send and receive crypto payments.
00:32:07.790 - 00:33:05.326, Speaker C: So this is a Japanese government issued ID. It's called the My number card. As you can see, it's an ID card issued to all Japanese residents, including children and foreigners, storing the information you see here, like name, address, birthday, gender, and a unique twelve digit individual number. The My number cards have an IC chip in them, and as of today, they've been issued to over 80 million people in Japan, which represents over 64% of the population. The main use case right now is limited to identity verification, but going forwards, additional use cases are going to be added by the government, including the phasing out of the health insurance card and driver's license, which will eventually be integrated into these Minor number cards. So our mission with Mina is to drive mainstream adoption of Web Three tech in Japan by enabling the Japanese government and residents and connecting them with developers across the world. The problem we're aiming to solve is private key management.
00:33:05.326 - 00:34:08.930, Speaker C: As you know, it's very difficult to write down your seed phrase and keep them safe, even for the most sophisticated users. Hardware wallets as well, are relatively expensive and have a steep learning curve, making it very unrealistic for them to be used by most people, especially here in Japan, which has the world's oldest population. Our solution is the minor browser wallet, and this enables Japanese residents to use their mind number card like a hardware wallet, giving them a simple and safe way to self custody their crypto and send and receive payments with just a few taps of their card. We also used account abstraction to generate ERC, four, three, seven compliant contract wallets for each My Number card, enabling features such as social recovery. So before I pass it on to the demo, if you could imagine a situation where any child or elderly person can receive NFTs with a simple few taps of their number card, and with that, I'll pass it on to the demo. Thank you, Dasan. I'm going to show how to use our wallet.
00:34:08.930 - 00:35:05.222, Speaker C: Let me see. Okay, so this is our brother Warren, and My number card is using Field communication, so we need NSC reader, but I didn't have time to buy NSC card reader, so I turned my Android phone to Ashi card reader. So in the website. In the browser, I'm going to connect to this Android Ashi reader via Web Bluetooth. Okay. I found then I connecting. Okay, now, this browser and NSC reader has been connected.
00:35:05.222 - 00:35:58.154, Speaker C: So then I'm going to generate the wallet. Actually, the account obstruction wallet by one tap. So I'm going to tap this Japanese government issued ID card. So then address is generated, and actually, this address is determined generated by account abstraction. So this account has not been deployed onto the Smart contract blockchain. But you can send Ether or other NFT assets to this contract address. And also, I have another card here, so just let me see.
00:35:58.154 - 00:36:17.014, Speaker C: I will connect again. Then just by puffing the card, then I generated the other word address. Actually. Thank you very much.
00:36:17.132 - 00:36:17.800, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:36:21.690 - 00:36:41.586, Speaker C: Actually, this account of absorption words have been deployed. And then I sent some here. Actually, the matic here. Could you please explain the sure. Okay, and let me quickly talk about the technology we used. We use ELC four three seven compliant.
00:36:41.638 - 00:36:53.950, Speaker A: Contract wallet, which works with LSA signature algorithm. Why LSA signature algorithm is because currently my number card only supports LSA signature.
00:36:54.290 - 00:37:05.266, Speaker C: Because that only supports LSA Signature OS. And we derive the contract account address from the modules, which is part of the RSA public key.
00:37:05.368 - 00:37:08.806, Speaker A: And then when verify the signature from.
00:37:08.828 - 00:37:48.320, Speaker C: The entry point to the contract wallet, we verify the RSS signature there. The idea is very simple, but yeah, we have a lot of use cases using this kind of ID card as a wallet. And thank you. And just to wrap up, so during this hackathon, we built a browser wallet where users could send and receive crypto payments. Post hackathon, we plan to build a browser extension where users will be able to not only send and receive payments, but to be able to connect to Web Three DApps as well. Thank you for your time, and we'd love to hear feedback if possible, so please reach out to us. Thank you.
00:37:48.320 - 00:37:51.134, Speaker C: Amazing.
00:37:51.332 - 00:38:04.100, Speaker A: How cool was that? This is like a really amazing real world application. Congratulations. All right, next up is probably nothing works. Give them a big round of applause and let them tell you what they built.
00:38:08.150 - 00:38:17.480, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm not brave enough to do a hardware demo live, so hi, everyone. My name is Jason, and I'm from probably nothing works.
00:38:18.490 - 00:38:23.030, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Akira. Hi, I'm Ray.
00:38:23.770 - 00:38:24.182, Speaker C: Hey.
00:38:24.236 - 00:38:25.014, Speaker A: And I'm Alan.
00:38:25.062 - 00:38:28.746, Speaker F: And we're going to talk to you today about permissionless ads protocol back to.
00:38:28.768 - 00:39:22.982, Speaker E: Jason and I'll begin with a little bit introduction or background about what is advertising and who the players are, just so that can set the stage. On the left side we have advertisers, so Adidas. On the right side, we have in the industry what we call a publisher, in this case Yuga Labs, and then the community, in this case Board Apholders. And our permissions app protocol basically matches the advertisers who want. To reach a community. And then publishers who want to bring interesting messages to their community as a way to kind of sustain themselves. Showing kind of our archetype of how we do this is everything starts on the lower left with a transaction because it's permissionless, so you can buy sell ads, campaigns all on chain.
00:39:22.982 - 00:40:12.880, Speaker E: We have a cows function that observes the order. And then once it observes it, it's an NFT that represents what we call inventory or the campaign, it displays it. And then we, for this particular demo, take the data back to Google Ads Manager for reporting, which we'll show. So we'll begin with a quick demo of what probably nothing that works looks like. And as you can see, it is just a very random website with ads on it. And to prove that the ads work, you can see that we've basically pre populated with some random stuff so that it's a live where we're working at.
00:40:14.770 - 00:40:17.840, Speaker F: Are we banned for the YouTube ad?
00:40:19.570 - 00:40:32.518, Speaker E: So now I will show you as a community how you can offer a co lab and I'll begin to show our three contracts and try to mint a ad unit. The two contracts we have are ad units, which is how communities say, I.
00:40:32.524 - 00:40:33.846, Speaker A: Want to offer a cold app, and.
00:40:33.868 - 00:40:35.398, Speaker E: Then a campaign is how advertisors say.
00:40:35.404 - 00:40:36.342, Speaker A: Hey, I want to work with you.
00:40:36.396 - 00:40:37.720, Speaker E: On this cold app.
00:40:42.170 - 00:40:52.678, Speaker F: Okay, so he's jumping over and showing now that there's some history of campaigns that got created and then we're going to be doing some minting inside of inside of Etherscap.
00:40:52.774 - 00:40:54.490, Speaker A: This is deployed on sepholia.
00:41:07.920 - 00:41:13.440, Speaker E: As you can see, we have a budget, we have a cost per click, we have an image, we have a name, et cetera, et cetera.
00:41:25.510 - 00:41:50.380, Speaker F: So we've already pre minted some campaigns because the campaigns on the ad server side take a little while to populate. Even the NFT minting is of course instant on the blockchain, but it takes a while for the campaign to start. So what we're showing here is creating some new inventory. So he's creating something at 10 some size parameters, XY, width, height, and did you submit it.
00:41:52.190 - 00:41:52.554, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:52.592 - 00:42:27.224, Speaker F: And then submit the transaction and then back on the website at probably nothing works. That's a DAP. So it's totally not interacting with the backend at all. It just reads data from Ethersjs to get the information from Sepolia and then renders the ad. So as soon as that transaction commits, it'll be live. When the campaigns were minted, we should also call out there's a few parameters. Basically what gets submitted is the creative.
00:42:27.224 - 00:42:57.450, Speaker F: So it's a banner, in this case a landing page, URL, price per Click. If you want to run a price per click campaign, let's say ten cents and a budget. So what we do is we're taking the total budget and collateralizing the campaign at that time into a vault. And then based on some reporting, which Jason will show you in a second is what the publisher of the ad inventory gets paid out from. You just created this one in the lower left, right?
00:42:58.140 - 00:42:58.824, Speaker A: That's correct.
00:42:58.862 - 00:43:04.890, Speaker E: So as you can see, we just permissionlessly created a new advertising unit that people can click.
00:43:12.120 - 00:43:12.644, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:43:12.682 - 00:43:12.896, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:12.938 - 00:43:52.788, Speaker F: And so now what he's showing is one of the nice things that's built into this centralized execution of the ad server is Google's put a lot of resources into making sure the clicks are not fraudulent. So it's civil resistant in that sense. And what he's showing here is that we can collect some click data from each of the ads that showed up. And also it's optimizing revenue for the owner of the space where the ad runs to make sure that the revenue is maximized. So, for example, if something has a very high price per click, it doesn't mean it always runs. If there's another campaign that's going to expire soon, you might want to harvest that revenue quickly before proceeding with the longer running, higher paying clicks. So that's all happened here.
00:43:52.788 - 00:44:04.040, Speaker F: And then the reporting data. We periodically pull this data into an oracle and then make the micro payments out to the advertisers sorry, to the publishers who are displaying the ads.
00:44:07.380 - 00:44:07.888, Speaker A: Quickly.
00:44:07.974 - 00:44:38.292, Speaker E: To summarize, it is a permission. Probably nothing that works is a permissionless advertising protocol. We allow communities to monetize their own assets in the future. We can have features like moderation that tells them, say, I want this, I don't want to do this. And the whole point is to connect Web two demand versus web Three communities, or connect Web two demand to web three communities. And then lastly, because these ads are actually NFT, right? So they become a tokenized revenue streams. What that means is a yield bearing asset.
00:44:38.292 - 00:44:57.970, Speaker E: And you can do all the very cool things you could do with DFI things. For example, fundraise what with them, borrow, lend, use them as collateral, do an interest rate swap, whatever it is you want. And these things are obviously tradable, highly liquid, et cetera, et cetera. That's it for our demo. Thank you so much for your time.
00:45:00.260 - 00:45:12.340, Speaker A: Awesome. Another amazing real world application. It's good. All right, a few more demos to go. Without further ado, let's welcome Appswap X. Please give them a big round of applause.
00:45:17.580 - 00:45:21.770, Speaker B: Hey, all. I am Mohit from App Swap X team.
00:45:22.220 - 00:45:23.480, Speaker C: And I am Deep.
00:45:23.980 - 00:45:25.992, Speaker B: So we started this problem saying that.
00:45:26.046 - 00:45:29.164, Speaker C: Smart contracts are passive scripts, and if.
00:45:29.202 - 00:45:36.316, Speaker B: We were to build automations on top of account abstraction, let's create a smart contract module. And that's how we started building out.
00:45:36.338 - 00:45:39.528, Speaker C: Appsopx, which is a smart contract module.
00:45:39.624 - 00:46:30.736, Speaker B: That allows you to automate transactions based on price change of a token or time change. I'll take it over to Mer to show you how the product works. Yeah, so let me go through the contracts that we have. So basically, we are currently live on polygon chain and Genosis mainnet chain. We are live on some other chains as well. For this demo I would be swapping my tokens from Polygon to Genosis and it will be an automated smart contract process which will be powered by Galato and we will be making the transfer of the assets and we'll be doing on chain swaps on the target chain through the connex and all that stuff. So let me talk about this.
00:46:30.736 - 00:47:21.180, Speaker B: Is our Polygon stand deployed contract. The same kind of contract with some additional features have been deployed on Genosis. So our contracts live on multiple chains and what I'm going to do is basically I will be creating a deposit. So it's like you as the user who wants to swap your USDC from Polygon and you want to transfer it to the Genosis chain to limit order on the GNO token. So what I will be doing like I have this create deposit, I have already filled some of the values. So what we have like if you are transferring like any native token you have to pass it here. Then we have this from address which is like from which address you want to transfer the money.
00:47:21.180 - 00:47:57.800, Speaker B: It can be your smart wallet account address or your EOA account address. Then we have like this two address on the target chain. You want to receive the amount and then this is the amount that we want to target. This is like 0.5 USDC and then there is like the price. So the price is basically at which price I want to do this swap on the target chain and I want to transfer the assets from this. And then this is like the prompt address which is like the USDC address on polygon scan and this is like a two token address which is on Genosis chain.
00:47:57.800 - 00:48:17.380, Speaker B: So I would be just quickly creating a deposit. I would be doing some aggressive because.
00:48:17.470 - 00:48:20.380, Speaker A: I want to pass transaction.
00:48:25.640 - 00:48:34.656, Speaker B: So let me wait for the transaction to happen. The contract is trying to store the.
00:48:34.678 - 00:48:37.356, Speaker C: X call data as well as how.
00:48:37.398 - 00:48:40.676, Speaker B: It needs to be sent from the source chain as well as on the.
00:48:40.698 - 00:48:43.984, Speaker C: Destination chain where it will be interpreted by X receive.
00:48:44.112 - 00:49:24.652, Speaker B: Yeah, so this transaction the deposited confirmed. What I will be doing is like I have this gelato ID which is triggered in the event I will be just searching for this gelato ID on the Gelato network. So you can see this is like our execute limit order that is automatically created from onchain smart contract. There is no nothing a server in between. Like we have no node JS server on any server. It's directly from the smart contract that this is happening and you can see like there are some task logs. So currently this is trying to execute but the price is not matching so this will not execute.
00:49:24.652 - 00:49:48.760, Speaker B: Now what I will be doing basically I will be like forcing the price. I had set the price of 82,000. So I will be just changing forcefully the price because actually we are getting the price from Oracles trustless Oracles. But for like this demo, I'm just forcing it to happen so that we can do this transaction quickly. Let me go. And aggressive transaction.
00:49:50.620 - 00:49:51.370, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:51.740 - 00:50:11.326, Speaker B: So let's wait for Galacto to execute this process so all the functions are.
00:50:11.348 - 00:50:14.206, Speaker C: Stored there so that it's transparent to the user how the X call is.
00:50:14.228 - 00:50:15.666, Speaker B: Going to be carried out and what.
00:50:15.688 - 00:50:19.826, Speaker C: Proxy is given to Gelato. I think by now the execution should.
00:50:19.848 - 00:50:55.710, Speaker B: Have yeah, so we have got the transaction hash, which Gelato has basically automatically executed. And this transaction hash you can see on the conex. So if I just search this transaction so you can see like, our transfer is happening from the polygon chain to the Genosis chain. And we already have bridged assets from the polygon token. And if I just copy this and search on logs how this is happening under the hood.
00:51:03.560 - 00:51:03.924, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:03.962 - 00:51:54.516, Speaker B: So you can see like it is going from uniswap. It is like finding the best path to execute that swap and from uniswap to like, it's our contract and then it is passing to the connex diamond. And then the Gelato is basically executing this transaction in an automated way and we will soon receive that funds on the target scene. So our motive with this project was if you have funds in your smart account and you want to on the Friday or Saturday or at the price, like $150 or $250, when ETH reach that much amount and you want to execute a swap on any of the chains that are not in your wallet, you can use our product and you can integrate our product in any of the smart contract and do that stuff, like, totally in a trustless way. Your funds are totally safe with us.
00:51:54.618 - 00:51:56.020, Speaker A: So that's our project.
00:51:56.090 - 00:51:56.950, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:52:01.800 - 00:52:14.380, Speaker A: Awesome. DeFi is not dead, and this is the type of automation that helps us do a lot more with what's happening on chain. All right, three more demos to go. So for our third last demo, please welcome project Tanuki.
00:52:24.620 - 00:52:25.736, Speaker C: Hi everyone.
00:52:25.918 - 00:53:02.464, Speaker G: We're the team from homedao. We've built Tanuki. So Tanuki is a trustless wallet score provider. So what is a wallet score? A wallet score is derived from on chain data and it's basically just a number that is associated with an address for a given service. So we categorized the scores into three categories. You have credit. Credit is based on your previous activity on DeFi protocols.
00:53:02.464 - 00:53:43.380, Speaker G: And it's useful to give you a credit score to determine lending rates. Social is useful for protocols like Lens, where you have a lot of bots. And this is like quite a common problem right now. A lot of people from Lens are telling me this is a pretty hot problem. So you can build a kind of indication of whether someone is a bot based on their historical on chain data. You also have trading, so you can give rewards based on volume. So it's quite common in TradFi to give discounts on fees based on volume that you trade in a protocol.
00:53:43.380 - 00:54:22.880, Speaker G: So these are some protocols that we identified that we think will benefit from the scores. So humor for example, is a credit line protocol. And right now they have a bunch of signals that they use to calculate credit scores. But these are mostly they have some off chain components always. So it's not fully trustless. So there isn't really a solution right now to aggregate data from historical on chain data and build a score based on that. So our solution uses Axiom, which is a ZK coprocessor.
00:54:22.880 - 00:55:14.256, Speaker G: And this allows us to trustlessly generate scores based on historical data. So we write a circuit, a ZK circuit that essentially aggregates data. So it could be summing up transactions or summing up or something more complicated like summing up volumes that you've traded on a given uniswap pool and that gets pushed onto a smart contract where the proof gets verified and scores get stored in the score provider contract. And this allows services to consume this in a really simple way through a view score function. So tanuki is trustless. You don't have to rely on any oracles. It's completely based on historical on chain data.
00:55:14.256 - 00:56:12.160, Speaker G: It's fair. An issue in TradFi with credit scores is that you don't actually know how exactly the credit scores are calculated. And for certain demographics or for certain people, they're not sure why they have a low credit score. But here you can see exactly how it's calculated and you can verify that it's fair and it's transparent because you can see exactly how it's calculated on chain. So this is a quote from Vitalik the most important scarce resource is legitimacy. And this is super relevant for on chain data because you have a lot of really valuable data that's sitting there, but it's not being utilized and it can be a source of a good source to signify if a given wallet is a legitimate user. So we built two use cases.
00:56:12.160 - 00:56:44.600, Speaker G: We built two services that build on top of the infrastructure that we built. One is a Dow gas subsidy service. So based on your activity in a Dow, the more you use the Dow, the more gas rebates you'll get on transactions. So we calculate a score. In this case it's 600. And based on that, they have a subsidy of 22% on any votes they do through the Dow. Second one was lending.
00:56:44.600 - 00:57:46.590, Speaker G: So with Ave as an example, lending protocols can use the historical on chain data as an input to how they calculate lending rates. A few more use cases. So obviously this can be used for lens, like I mentioned, and other social media protocols for spam prevention can be used for airdrops. So right now all airdrops involve an off chain component, and it can also be used for insurance. So if you know someone uses certain protocols based on their history, then you can tailor insurance specifically to them. So, in summary, we think that there's a lot of very valuable data sitting on chain, and it's not being utilized in a way that's decentralized and trustless. And we think that a lot of services can use this data to build services on top.
00:57:46.590 - 00:57:53.740, Speaker G: And in combination with a car abstraction, it can be used for gas subsidies and other use cases.
00:57:57.310 - 00:57:58.300, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:58:01.330 - 00:58:08.110, Speaker A: Awesome. All right, two more demos to go. Without further ado, let's welcome Yoru.
00:58:16.160 - 00:59:06.608, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. My name is Charles, and me and my teammates Lamda, Nick and Changwoo and Randy here we are, Team Yoru, and we're glad to be here to introduce our project. Okay, so Yoru is a privacy preserving DApp for social crypto payment. And there are two major concepts behind that. The first one is Steel's address, which is for better privacy. And the second one is AA abstract account, which is for better user experience. And let's say Alice want to transfer some token or some asset to Bob.
00:59:06.608 - 01:00:37.850, Speaker C: So instead of transfer those token and asset to the address of Bob directly, the Alice will generate a one time address for Bob and transfer those token to that just generated address. And the new generated address is actually a wallet contract, and it's actually an abstract account for Bob. So the Bob actually has the ownership of that smart contract wallet. And there's a formula of how Alice can generate the address for the Bob. And when Bob trying to withdraw his phone that he just received, all he has to do is that calculate the new private key from his original private key and then provide the value signature to submit to the blockchain. Because the new address is the abstract account, actually the withdrawal can be gasless, which means that Bob doesn't have to send some ether to the new address in order to withdraw the token on that account. So here's a link of our repository, and let's go to the live demo.
01:00:37.850 - 01:01:15.856, Speaker C: Okay, our demo is pretty simple. It comprised of two transactions. The first one is the sender sending tokens to receiver's still address. And from everyone else's point of view, this address is like a random Yo address. Nobody knows that this address belongs to the receiver. And for the second transaction is for a receiver to spend the token he received from the sender. And what's amazing about this transaction is that the receiver is going to have a third party paying for his gas fee and deploy his account abstraction and also transfer away the token.
01:01:15.856 - 01:02:09.740, Speaker C: And this great user experience is only made possible by the EIP for the three seven account abstraction. Okay, let's begin our demo. Okay, so first we are going to have a receiver log into the depth, and he's going to register. Why this register is necessary because he's going to publicly share his public key. This is because the sender need this private key to compute the receiver's scale address. But don't worry, this information does not leak or compromise receiver's privacy. And you can imagine that in the future, when did system is ready, you can attach Twitter handle or Telegram handle to your did.
01:02:09.740 - 01:02:55.724, Speaker C: And from this information, sender can. After sending the transaction via Euro, you can notify the receiver via the Twitter or Telegram. Okay, now the receiver has registered. And now we will have sender, login and meta transfer. So now as a sender, I want to send some ether to the recipient so I can use different social IDs together. The public key of the recipient. Here we use an ENS domain, for example.
01:02:55.724 - 01:04:06.180, Speaker C: And then we choose to send some ether to the recipient. Also, we support yards pointing at NFT as well. So now I click Send and confirm the transaction in my wallet. Okay, and now the transfer is really a simple ERC 20 ether transfer. But it will have an event emit on the blockchain, special event emit blockchain. In order to let the recipient be aware, be notified that there's an incoming transfer that he may want to check on the blockchain to see which transaction he's receiving. Okay, so now the recipient have to log into the app to scan through the blockchain to see whether there's an incoming transfer for him.
01:04:06.180 - 01:05:28.280, Speaker C: So he clicked receive and then he clicked the scan. So now you can see there is a new address, new generated address for the recipient that he can collect the funds from the address. Okay? So right now he can click the withdrawal to get the fund. Okay, after confirming that transaction, we can check online whether how the transaction is executed. Okay, this is the second transaction we demo. As we previously mentioned, this transaction is amazing because it take care of having third party paying for the gas fee and deploy the account contract and also transfer away the token. And this is all made possible by the account abstraction design.
01:05:28.280 - 01:05:32.840, Speaker C: Okay, and that's our demo. Thank you.
01:05:38.010 - 01:05:48.250, Speaker A: Awesome. Lot of account abstraction. All right, last demo and the last finalist for today, please give a big round of applause to Superplay.
01:05:53.390 - 01:05:58.350, Speaker C: Konichua. Everyone. We are Superplay. And I'm Moriki from Superplay.
01:05:59.650 - 01:06:00.522, Speaker A: I'm Leon.
01:06:00.586 - 01:06:01.774, Speaker D: Nice to meet you.
01:06:01.972 - 01:06:31.282, Speaker C: I'm Yuchen. Yeah. So we are like building Superplay for website gaming. And our mission is just very simple. The onboarding the next billion people to Webster Gaming. We believe website gaming is the key for mass adoption, but we have a little market gap between the current situation and the whole day gaming industry. So as for the current situation, we have only 1 million wallet address for the NFD and gaming.
01:06:31.282 - 01:06:36.570, Speaker C: But as for the gaming itself, we have more than 2 billion users in the world.
01:06:36.720 - 01:06:38.266, Speaker A: So as for the market gap, we.
01:06:38.288 - 01:06:52.560, Speaker C: Have more than 2000 like market gap. So if you can get more than 10% or 50% of those kind of gaming users to crypto, it's huge. So we have a lot of frontiers for the crypto market.
01:06:54.210 - 01:06:55.886, Speaker A: But still we have a lot of.
01:06:55.908 - 01:07:00.740, Speaker C: Problems between for onboarding gaming users to Web Three.
01:07:01.510 - 01:07:03.266, Speaker A: It takes a lot of calls for.
01:07:03.368 - 01:07:16.630, Speaker C: Wallet setup for the beginners and also for gamers. Crypto stuff is too difficult for them to understand. There was also the gatsby as well. So that's why we built Superplay.
01:07:19.630 - 01:08:19.126, Speaker D: Onwards with what we actually have built. We have an infrastructure SDK. Well, this light is very bright SDK for implementing essentially account abstraction through just an email registration. So essentially we have been using Web Three Auth as a service that will generate an EOA account and then from that EOA account we will generate an AA account rather account abstraction, right, which will serve as an intermediary between the user who's just logged in with his email, essentially, and the game which is on chain. With this we also fund the AA account with ERC, 20 tokens which will allow the user to actually do stuff on chain. And then later on, if he or she wants to continue on playing, they can subscribe and get more tokens and more funds to actually do on chain stuff. So I will quickly just now go through the architecture.
01:08:19.126 - 01:08:56.790, Speaker D: I know this is kind of small guys. In the back you can't probably see this, but on the left side we have the creation of the account. Essentially what's happening is the user just submits his email through Web Three alt. It goes to our service. So our service actually uses SAFE's SDK, which creates AA wallet and also uses Superfluid as a token streaming platform. So essentially what we do is we fund the AA account with tokens and we create a stream that goes back to us from the user account. So essentially we have essentially built a free trial period for a game one chain.
01:08:56.790 - 01:09:30.514, Speaker D: So that's the creation part. And then the interaction part on the right side is a bit more simple. It's essentially a user is doing an action that can be any game action and it's actually very easy to implement that. It goes through our service, then it goes to a relay which is essentially an off chain executor. And then from there we actually execute the transaction through the account and the game. Now we're going to go to the demo. All right, so if we click start here and wait for it.
01:09:30.514 - 01:09:39.142, Speaker D: So this is the web three auth interface. Essentially, I'm just going to do login with Google. I'm going to use, for example, this.
01:09:39.196 - 01:09:39.910, Speaker C: Mail.
01:09:45.240 - 01:10:14.990, Speaker D: And what's happening in the background. Essentially, we have generated a ethereum address based on the email, the Google certification, okay, so we create an account and this is essentially a very basic game interface, let's say. So essentially on the left side we have the profile. This is the profile of the user. So on the left you can see the name. And then we have these SP tokens. Those are the tokens that we have airdropped to the account.
01:10:14.990 - 01:10:50.788, Speaker D: Essentially, as you can see on the right there, says 100 SP per week. So essentially it's seeping out 100 SP per week from the account. And essentially by doing that you can actually set a period of time by which his or her free trial of the game will be finished. And then on the right you just have whatever the game interface wants. So essentially you can buy some items, you can bet all the users or do essentially whatever you want. So essentially the whole idea was to create a modular SDK. It's very easy to implement.
01:10:50.788 - 01:11:08.560, Speaker D: And yeah, one more thing that we can do is actually charge. So if the trial is done and we're happy with the game, we can just click on Charge. And by using SAFE's Safes Kit, we can actually just use Stripe to pay in some more crypto and actually continue.
01:11:08.630 - 01:11:09.730, Speaker A: Playing on the game.
01:11:10.820 - 01:11:24.648, Speaker D: I think that's about it. One SEC. This is our tech stack. I did the Devil. And this is our team, Rashimi. She isn't here currently. She's a speaker at DSAI, me, Leon, Yuchen and Moriki.
01:11:24.648 - 01:11:33.540, Speaker D: And just as a final remark, and as the final demo of the day, I would like to thank all of the organizers and I guess we'll see you in Lisbon.
01:11:40.220 - 01:12:00.616, Speaker A: Thank you and congrats. Those were our eleven incredible finalist demos. I know all of you are tired, so I'm going to try my best to wrap everything up as quickly as possible. But I don't think you'll have any trouble staying up for the next part because we're giving away a lot of money before we get to that. Tough crowd.
01:12:00.808 - 01:12:01.820, Speaker C: Stupid.
01:12:06.180 - 01:12:36.808, Speaker A: I'm also tired. It's okay, don't worry. I'm not offended. Well, before we get all to all of that stuff, the most incredible thing here is that there are some obvious themes. So we're seeing a lot of stuff around DKPs becoming more and more common and fast. We're seeing a lot of real world applications and as you've already guessed, looks like account abstraction is about to be everyday thing. So effectively these events become a way for you to see what the next year looks like in all of Web Three and Tech.
01:12:36.808 - 01:12:58.636, Speaker A: And we hope that you get to take home some of these themes and make them better for millions and billions more people. All right, let's get to all the next stuff. I want to thank all these eleven finalists one more time for coming here doing live demos. It's not easy. Things can always go wrong.

This is the survey from Is Talk from the opening ceremony.
01:13:22.868 - 01:13:45.170, Speaker A: Just quickly take a scan here. It'll take you less than two minutes, maybe more. I don't know. It'll be very quick. It helps us really understand how do we evolve the culture of ethereum and how do we actually make all these events better and bring more people in. So I'll wait for five more seconds, but I really appreciate you all doing this. There we go.

Made is going to be the best Cismo connected app or for offshore use case of 1500 and XON and Made are also taking an additional $500 for the best data provider category. Congratulations to all three of these teams. Up next scroll. I'm going to prepare myself for this one.
01:25:55.950 - 01:26:52.380, Speaker A: All of these teams are going to be receiving a lot of small amounts of money, but $5,000 will be split between these 68 teams and looks like the world is excited about ZKE EVs. And last but not least, these two prizes are going to be announced very soon. We couldn't get to all of them in the time to do this thing, so we'll be notifying all the reason and Huddle one prize applicants if they won those prizes over email. And they'll also show up on your hacker dashboard with a really nice pop up message saying you want money? All right, these were all the prizes. And in a couple of hours, you'll be able to go on your own project and refresh the page and you'll see what prizes you've won. So if you didn't read this or you're sleeping now, which doesn't matter because you won't hear me, you can just go on your dashboard and you'll see all the prizes your team has won. So congratulations again to everybody.
01:26:52.380 - 01:27:35.114, Speaker A: That was more than $400,000 being given away, and I have five minutes before I'm being told I need to stop talking. So let's try to wrap this up. Quick notes on some logistics. All these announcements are tentative and not final, which means we're going to verify everybody's source code. We're going to make sure everybody followed the rules, nobody cheated, and that'll take us two to three weeks. This also means that if you are an applicant and a winner for a full prize and we end up disqualifying some team for cheating, the numbers will change and you'll be notified of any of those changes. So we'll take the next couple of weeks to do all of that, and all prizes will be delivered on May 5 or by May 5.
01:27:35.114 - 01:28:13.530, Speaker A: What does that actually mean? It means do not ask me again when the prizes are coming before May 5. Okay, thank you. Speaking of thank yous. No, you got to take a break because we're going to clap constantly now for the next seven slides. All right, this is the last part of all of what I'm going to say before we enjoy the rest of our evenings. So before we wrap this up, I want to make sure we give a big shout out to everybody that made this event possible and that's a lot of people that are involved in making this successful. 1500 people is a lot.
01:28:13.530 - 01:28:42.466, Speaker A: Just look at this room behind you. It's packed and it requires a lot of logistics and a lot of people to make all of this work. And these are some of the people that are doing all this work behind the scenes. Want to make sure we give a quick second to thank them for all the time they put in this weekend and months and weeks before. But before I get to thank all of these four categories, I want to thank all of you hackers for being here with us over this weekend. Congratulations to doing something amazing. You didn't have to be here in a building locked up for the last 48 hours, but you chose to do this.
01:28:42.466 - 01:29:09.670, Speaker A: You chose to build something you were excited about. And that means a lot. And that means we get to see more and more cool things in this ecosystem. So thank you so much. Of course, I'm all of our amazing judges, for taking the time and talking to all of you. So please give our judges once again a big round of applause. So many volunteers and mentors taking 24/7 shifts, not sleeping, sometimes sleeping too much, but also helping everybody get to where they want it to be and making sure everything runs super, super smoothly.
01:29:09.670 - 01:29:53.462, Speaker A: So thank you for all of these amazing mentors and volunteers, all of our amazing speakers who gave all these talks workshops that you get to use and learn from. Without this, none of this will be possible. This is the education we want to bring forward and make available for free for everybody. So thank you to our speakers, and I know you won't be able to read it, but this is all the list of people who are behind the scenes making all these things possible from all of our incredible partners. Once you see any of them here, thank them for all their work and time and also taking their time to spend the weekend with you to make sure you're successful. So please give our partners a big round of applause. And I want to give a few special shout outs to a couple people, mia, Reno and ARU and Juan.
01:29:53.462 - 01:30:37.654, Speaker A: We've seen them constantly running around, and of course, Arena, Tumo, Masai and Tyra for helping us pull this event off for the last four months, for being incredible hosts, making sure we don't make stupid decisions, really, and helping all of this be successful. And last but not least, I'd like the biggest round of applause for the ETH Global team. I'm here on stage, but they did all the work. So a big shout out to oygen, Taylor, Fred, Rory, Wilbur, George, Chloe, Kevin, K, Kevin, Ivan, Cree, Uichi, Minnie, Anna, MOAS, Emily, Andrew and Jacob. The sign of a good event and amazing operation is that you don't have too many things to complain about. And if nothing is there for you to notice, that means it was running smoothly. And this is a team that makes it happen.
01:30:37.654 - 01:30:56.654, Speaker A: So they deserve all that recognition. So make sure you thank all of them whenever you get a chance. Okay, well, I lied. There's another section. The finalists. So we saw ten teams come up. We saw a lot of prizes from our partners, and you kind of saw, okay, well, all the prizes were for the partners, but then not all the teams were listed there.
01:30:56.654 - 01:31:28.386, Speaker A: What's going on? If you've never been to a neat global event before, there's one thing that we do differently than everything else. This event is not a competition. Our goal is to help others get into this space and understand what's possible. And as part of that, we want to make sure that we get to surface interesting ideas and not make this competitive, where we get to force people to be 1st, 2nd, 3rd. So effectively, all eleven of those teams are our first place winners. And as the finalists, they all came in first. So congratulations to all eleven of those teams.
01:31:28.386 - 01:32:05.358, Speaker A: And as part of being a finalist, you'll be getting a 500 USDC in addition to everything per member from ETH Global for being an incredible, incredible participant this weekend.

For all the pragmas we're going to do at ETH Global, you'll get a free entry to all of these events.

Access to push video alpha for the amazing things that you can do there. And a pro tier access to web three storage if you are building anything that requires decentralized storage.
