00:00:08.110 - 00:00:35.206, Speaker A: All right, welcome everybody. Thanks for all of your patience. We are ready to kick off our first day and our first session of judging for Market Make real quick. This has been an amazing event for us. This is our first event for this year. We have 490 hackers that are hacking today and they are from 58 different countries spending seven different time zones, and together they have worked on 120 projects. So this is our first judging session.
00:00:35.206 - 00:01:48.110, Speaker A: We'll be looking at a subset of these projects today and I want to quickly just cover the format of this session and then move on to our very first demo. So each team will have about eight minutes in total from where four minutes of them are dedicated to a video demo that they pre recorded and the rest, four minutes remaining. Four minutes go for a Q and A from our judges and we'll also be doing a two to three minute break before the just talk among themselves and sort of clarify any questions as part of this process. And then we'll do a ten minute break halfway through, about an hour or so mark and that's kind of the format we'll prefer. And we'll obviously keep this somewhat fluid to account for any changes or differences in the agenda. So the way everything has been set up, the criteria for how judging is going to work today is as follows. There's going to be five categories we'll be scoring our teams on based on how technical, original, practical the project is, along with how the user interface and or developer interface has been addressed for the given project, for the intended audience.
00:01:48.110 - 00:02:43.810, Speaker A: And then we also have a category that we like to call the wow factor, which functions as I catch all for our events, for any categories or any things that we have missed from the four categories above. And before we move on to our first demo, I want to just remind everybody that this is not a competition. People presenting here and who are participating at this hackathon are here to learn. They're not aiming to become businesses. Our goal is to make sure that they get the resources and the freedom to play with and experiment with what they are passionate about and also really showcase the things that they've been working on for the past few weeks. So the hackers here are very much team to get feedback and the goal is to design this whole experience to give them that today and doing their hard jobs are going to be our three judges. And I have messed up the slides.
00:02:43.810 - 00:03:20.174, Speaker A: I'll be quickly going through our judges, tommy Kolchat from Ave. We have mentia from Consensus and we have Alex Chapman from Coinbase, who we're going to be looking at all of our projects and commenting on and giving their feedback to all of our teams. So, without further ado, I'd like to move on to our very first team for today, and that is team Winvoy. And we have Dragos and Diego and Europe from the team. So whenever you're ready, please feel free to share your demo. This is winvoy. You get paid now.
00:03:20.174 - 00:03:49.938, Speaker A: Your b. Two b clients pay later. Most B two B payments happen on net terms. This means that you deliver your worker product and you won't get paid until a few months later. This has a big effect on your short term cash flow. Traditionally, this problem is solved by financial providers that buy your outstanding invoices at a discount and advance your sum money. Most of these providers offer full book factoring, meaning that they finance all invoices for a certain client.
00:03:49.938 - 00:04:29.954, Speaker A: And in the case of selective invoice finance providers, they tend to take between 24 to 48 hours, if not more. Every time you want to receive in advance a particular invoice, there has to be a better way. Winvoy is a decentralized invoice finance platform that allows companies to extend flexible payment terms to their B two B clients. Now how does it work? Let's imagine there are the following participants acme, small companies selling to other companies. They use Winvoy to request payments, create invoices, and get access to invoice finance. Big company is alchemy's client. They request the vendors to invoice them in net 90.
00:04:29.954 - 00:05:26.370, Speaker A: Winvoy and Ave as our liquidity provider. Let's see it in action. Let's say I'm Agme and I send BitCo a payment request for $120,000. I would go to my payments tab, request a new payment, select Bitcoin, enter the amount without the VAT, which will be added there, and offer them two payment options. Pay now, let's say with a 3% discount if they pay me within one day or pay the full amount in 90 days as they request all other vendors. I review the payment request and it's sent to BitCo. Now I'm bico.
00:05:26.370 - 00:06:08.760, Speaker A: I will get a payment request and see the payment options. Let's say in this case I prefer to pay in 90 days. I sign the invoice and I can see that it was tokenized and created and I can download it from here. Now back to Acme. I see that BitCo wants to pay by invoice in 90 days, but I have the option to advance some of this amount. I click advance and I see that I can get part of this money for 1% per month. I select $30,000, click borrow, and I get the money.
00:06:08.760 - 00:06:51.022, Speaker A: Now after those 90 days, it's time for BitCo to pay the invoice. They would go to a window checkout page, pay the $120,000, and they're done. At this point, Agme will get the remaining amount. So what happened in the background? When BitCo decides to pay by invoice, the invoice is created and tokenized. At that point, the Winvoy protocol checks the rates for the availability liquidity pools. In this case Avez, the Winvoy app checks the invoice risk score based on the combination of the credit score of the borrower, the client and other factors. It adds a fee based on this risk and offers a facility to Acme.
00:06:51.022 - 00:07:36.104, Speaker A: If Acme accepts the conditions, Winvoy borrows the requested amount from Abe, providing the necessary collateral and deposits the funds in Acme's account. When BitCo pays the invoice, the Winvoy protocol will reroute part of the payment to Ave to repay the loan, keep the fee and send the remaining balance to Agme. We will continue working on finishing the credit risk model, building Winvoy protocol and the UX for liquidity providers that's Winvoy. You get paid now, your B, two B clients pay later. Thanks so much. Awesome. That was a really cool polished demo and thanks for going first.
00:07:36.104 - 00:07:42.030, Speaker A: So what I'll do is I'll just let Alex and Men kind of kick us off with any comments or questions.
00:07:44.560 - 00:08:02.580, Speaker B: That was really cool, team. I love sort of business based applications of a lot of our cool DeFi applications. A protocol so gravel for that very creative and professional demo. I guess my first question is what other features do you want to build out with the Winboy protocol?
00:08:03.480 - 00:09:12.330, Speaker A: So the main one, we were thinking about potentially combining all the invoices. So instead of allowing the company to withdraw or advance the money invoice by invoice, we could potentially combine all the tokenized invoices, create some sort of credit facility or credit line backed by those invoices and just make the process more transparent for the user so that they know they have these many invoices outstanding and they can withdraw or advance however many dollars they can. That was very cool. I actually had a question, I may have missed this too. What kind of happens if the liquidity providers from lend provide the liquidity and then the business decides they don't actually want to fulfill the payment? What's the thought there on how that can get people can made a whole I guess. Yeah, that's a good question. So we're looking at it from three different perspectives.
00:09:12.330 - 00:10:04.016, Speaker A: One of them, we are thinking about having a credit insurance on the invoices. So every single invoice will be insured. Then on top of that, we will basically divert part of the fee that we earned to create like a deposit, basically balance or whatever. And then apart from that, what we can do is offer these invoices to debt recovery agents like basically brick and mortar companies that can then go and chase for these payments. Obviously we would sell those invoices or the rights to the invoices at a discount. But between the three we believe that we can basically mitigate the risk as much as possible. Cool.
00:10:04.016 - 00:11:23.654, Speaker A: I have sort of one more similar question too. Do you think it'd be a problem right now given the DeFi space, the ridiculous APIs, people are getting convincing sort of liquidity providers within the Iva platform to put their money up in these sort of things where there's potentially juicier APIs. Yeah, that's a potential problem that we have. What we're thinking is if we advance invoices at 2% per month, let's say it's 24% Apr, and if we offer that on stable coins, it's not the greatest yield that you can offer in this day and age, but it still is a pretty good one. Plus it's not correlated with the crypto industry, it's correlated with the, let's say, traditional economy. So we believe that for some investors, profiles might be interesting. Quick question, I look at your project and one of the things that came to my mind is that have you considered it some sort of like tokenization of the receivables and then somehow using them as collateral to draw more liquidity and this way kind of like supercharging the activity? Absolutely.
00:11:23.654 - 00:11:57.506, Speaker A: Actually, we tokenize the invoice when we present the payment option to the payer, to the final payer, they will have to select the payment term when they decide to pay by invoice. At that point they have to sign. So we tokenize that and what we want to do is exactly what you're saying, trying to use that as collateral. Interesting. Is that ERC, 71 in that case, sorry, we're not actually tokenizing it yet. We're just signing it for now and checking that it's signed by Winwood. But yeah, we know what you're saying.
00:11:57.506 - 00:12:28.300, Speaker A: You're saying, like, tokenizing, it like making it an NFT. Yeah. Okay, so non fungible will be that's quite interesting. Awesome. Well, thank you so much to the team and if you have more questions for judges, we'll just read them to you directly over Discord. So with that, we'll move on to our second project, and that is Team Levave. So I'll have them share their video now.
00:12:28.300 - 00:13:11.958, Speaker A: Hi everyone. This is Team Levave. Levave is a user friendly platform for leveraging non custodial positions on chain. It is powered by industry leading protocols, Aave and One Inch. What's the motivation behind it? Enable everyday users to open on chain positions with just a few clicks. Existing protocols are very confusing and have a UX centered around power users. The users also need to verify and trust the protocol being powered by Aave.
00:13:11.958 - 00:13:48.354, Speaker A: We support all tokens available on Aave with deep liquidity and high trust factor. Using one inch, our users also get the best market swap rates. Using Levawe dashboard, users can open multiple long and short positions, monitor their health factor and close them all with just a few clicks. Here's an overview of our protocol. Let's have a look at it with a simple example where user wants to go three x long on link. Using we as collateral. The user deposits one.
00:13:48.354 - 00:14:14.722, Speaker A: We to levawe. We take a flash loan of two we from Ave. We swap the three we for equivalent amount of link. In this case, it comes to around 200 on one inch. Next, we deposit 200 link on Aviators collateral and borrow a sum of two we. Plus the flash loan premium. We repay the flash loan and the premium.
00:14:14.722 - 00:14:57.770, Speaker A: Okay, so next, as you can see, at the end of the transaction, the user will be left with alink tokens and a debt of two we against it on Ave. So here I present to you the Leva platform. On the left hand section, you can configure and open up new positions. Once you open up a position, it's going to show up here in the Positions tab and you can close them with just one click. So from the example discussed before, let's go ahead and create a three X long position on Link using we as collateral here, I have selected we from the tokens. I have selected Link. From the token, I have put in the collateral amount, I have selected three x leverage.
00:14:57.770 - 00:15:38.050, Speaker A: You can configure your slippage tolerance and keep an eye out on the estimated health factor from here. Once done, just press on this flash long. The MetaMask is going to pop up a few times and just click on confirm voila. It's done. As you can see, it shows you the pair, the loaned amount, the position and the leveraged asset and the actual health factor here. And with just one click, you can also close this position. Finally, let's have a look at what the future holds.
00:15:38.050 - 00:16:17.478, Speaker A: We want to provide our users with ease of mind by automating the stop loss and take profit feature. We want to notify our users about possible liquidations and associated health factor risks. We want to implement gas tokens and thus save up to 43% gas on one inch swap fees. And finally, we want to enable better decision making by providing data and statistics about multiple tokens on the platform itself. Thank you, guys. That was great. Thanks so much for that video.
00:16:17.478 - 00:17:03.540, Speaker A: I'll let our judges jump in. Hey, that was very cool. I actually had a very specific question from the last slide. Exactly how would you guys want to automate the stop loss and take profit thoughts for how you do that? So we have a couple of ideas. For example, we looked at the Gelato platform that could automate the execution of the function when the price of certain asset based on what the user chose as stop loss or take profit, which could be fetched with a chain link corrigor price feed. And so, yeah, we talked about that we could solve in that way.
00:17:08.170 - 00:17:24.570, Speaker B: This is really cool, guys. And I think the UI is definitely very unique. So congrats on that. I'll definitely remember it in sort of today's high gas price environments. You have a lot of contract calls there. How do you think about minimizing that for your users?
00:17:25.470 - 00:18:41.120, Speaker A: So, yes, you would see it in the presentation. At the moment, to open a long position, it costs 1 million gas, and we think we can save a bit by removing the storage. At the moment, we are saving the position some storage to show it in the front end. We can save a bit by implementing a subgraph but actually for our estimation at the moment we think we cannot go below around 700 800,000 because of the cost of all the operation on Ave and one inch. So yeah, with the current fees on Ave we think around 700 800 could be the best optimization. I was thinking that this is actually a kind of similar question as opposed to the previous project, but for a reason. Are those positions tokenized? So let's say you create a position.
00:18:41.120 - 00:20:08.220, Speaker A: Is there actually like a punchable token for that? That's something interesting because in one way you could create a long and short position at the same time and then practically you end up having a stable coin or you create a position just one x short, you have a kind of a stable coin that's kind of like interesting about this. And also if the positions are tokenized it's kind of like and you have some sort of orders, let's say stop losses and so forth might create an interesting like some sort of secondary market. I don't know if there is like a demand for anything like that but just quite interesting. Yeah, at the moment the position are not organized so the smart contract is completely noncustodial and basically just interact with the Ave pools and the one inch swap and the user just ends up with a position on Ave basically. But actually we talked about tokenizing the positions. We don't have specific answer on how to do it at the moment, but yeah, we think it would be a cool idea. Also like other platform have tried, I guess.
00:20:08.220 - 00:20:45.930, Speaker A: I'm not sure if there's something on working but there's another app that I was seeing that they were trying those tokenized positions. Cool. Nice project, I really like the idea. It's kind of like with two different protocols you achieve it well. Thank you so much Levave. And with that we'll move on to our third demo and that is Team Droplet Pool. So whenever you're ready Singh, feel free to share your screen.
00:20:45.930 - 00:21:26.754, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Nice background. Good no? Most Internet users were spoiled by some form of free service. The problem is that they're not really free. In January, WhatsApp alarms its update? User terms and agreement. All of a sudden, users start concerning about their privacy and spark a migration to other messenger apps like Signal and Telegram. Signal gains more than 7.5
00:21:26.754 - 00:22:09.178, Speaker A: million users between January 6 and ten. Shortly after that, Signal's service was down for almost a day. Because of the overwhelming news users, it is questionable how many more free users Signal can support with the current business model. All we know is that users do not like service that came to be free but actually selling your data. Decentralized solutions sound perfect where users have direct control over the data. However, users do not want to pay for any similar service as it has been free for them the whole time. And how can we transition consumers from so called free service to paper use decentralized service? Let me present you droplet pool.
00:22:09.178 - 00:22:47.334, Speaker A: It is a not less membership DeFi application. The concept is easy to understand. Users take a certain amount of coins to join a membership offered by a service provider. Droplet Pool would deposit the stake into Avery and deliver the yield to the service providers periodically. When the user no longer lead the membership, he or she can simply withdraw 100% of the stake and virtually enjoy the membership for free. It is a new form of nonless and decentralized membership model unlocked by the powerful define. Let's check out the demo last p ten.
00:22:47.334 - 00:23:45.128, Speaker A: We are a service provider and let's create a new membership program and you can specify the state price. And for creating a membership program we actually need to stake one dime. Do you actually go to joblet Pool for maintaining this service? That's it. Let's say we are a user and then we can search for membership program to join on this platform. So we're going to showcase join this particular Discord membership program here and it's showing that we need to stake one dime to join this program. Then we're going to showcase how integration can be done with this smart contract and joblet Pool. So for the Discord cases we have integrated a job robot for the Discord.
00:23:45.128 - 00:25:01.350, Speaker A: And now I had joined the members program and I can go into this journal channel to ask the bot to log me in. It will give me a half on the K link which will bring me back to a web page with my wallet connected and then we'll half on the K with my wallet and then now I will go back to the discord, will show me that I already have the VIP channel added. So let's say now the user change his or her mind and want to withdraw from the program. So you can simply unsubscribe here and then we get order all our state back and we check the Discord again. So the VIP channel is no longer there. We have been removed from the VIP channel automatically. In this demo we have showcased how joblet Pool can provide a lossless membership to users, how users can take full control on the subscription and enjoy the membership for free, as well as how service providers can utilize such a defined application to earn you and communicate with its members.
00:25:01.350 - 00:25:12.550, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much for that demo. I'll let our judges dig in.
00:25:17.820 - 00:25:40.000, Speaker B: Thank you. Singh that was very cool. There are obviously some cool D five communities that I think will really lean into what you're building. But do you have any sort of web two communities in mind that you think this will be very relevant for and you can sort of use it as a crypto onboarding mechanism of sorts.
00:25:42.260 - 00:26:30.290, Speaker A: I aware that there is a big blockchain and cryptocurrency community and the thing is that most of them would try to open up their own Discord server and then there are many user on there and then some of them they're utilizing to provide support as well. However, they would like to keep those support servers free. But then the problem is that there are too many people questioning bomb buying the support team. So I picture that would be an interesting target power customer that would provide this kind of loss lag and state based membership that people need to stake to join a support Discord channel to ask questions.
00:26:31.460 - 00:26:37.730, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. We'll have to ask Danny. I mean the ave Discord is certainly very active all the time.
00:26:38.760 - 00:27:46.410, Speaker A: Yeah, that could be a potential place. That's pretty interesting. I really like the way that you actually use Discord here in this hack and this could be actually a way of creating, if someone has subscription services, getting free subscriptions, that could be also like a way to scale this thing. I think the whole idea seemed to be simple, but it's actually an important one is that technically we have a lot of perfect or amazing things happening for the web free and the decentralized communities. However, it's still a little bit difficult to get into the mainstream market because of the economical reason that people are spoiled by the free service. So how to transition that and draft more of those user momentum and mass into the community I think is important. Definitely.
00:27:46.410 - 00:28:36.400, Speaker A: I just want to say this is very cool, more so than any specific question against it. I'm just curious what you think. If you had more time to do more stuff on it, what's the next thing you would add to it? That's a lot to be add. However, one thing I would like to get a better understanding is to put it actually it's already on the test lab. I would like to get some more feedback from the community and see how they like or do not like this kind of product and how we can do better on that before I invest more time into the technical aspect of it. Great. And maybe I'll just kind of put in a question on myself.
00:28:36.400 - 00:29:34.820, Speaker A: You kind of sort of talked about this on the video, but what's next on Replying to continue working on this? What are you looking to add or test? So I get it on a test layer. So we try to do some more testing there and then the next thing is to get it on the main net and find some potential pilot user on it. And one more thing that I have in mind is that if it turned out there's a demand that we can actually turn the membership into a NFT token and make the membership transferable. However, my question is that do the service provider and the user really like this kind of thing or not, or it's actually too technical for them to digest on that end. That's a really cool concept. I think that'll be pretty fun to have a secondary market for memberships, but sounds great. Well, thank you so much for presenting today and thanks for working on this cool hack.
00:29:34.820 - 00:30:30.910, Speaker A: With that, we are ready to move on to our next team and that is Project Paladin. So I see accident is already here, so whenever you're ready, feel free to share your video. Looks like the audio is not coming through, so we try one more time. We're not getting the audio. You just have to exit the screen, share and then click the sound box one more time. Hey everyone. So Majorism.
00:30:30.910 - 00:31:29.658, Speaker A: We wanted to try and flesh out the idea of a governance lending protocol that we like to call Paladin. The idea behind it is that we want to polarize speculators and on chain governance activists. For financial protocols, it is very important to have a decentralized governance, not only for idealistic reasons, but also for regulatory and economic reasons. This essential aspect of decentralization has not been worked on very much yet and we'd like to tackle it. The idea behind what we're trying to do is that we're trying to create a new money Lego that allows speculators to earn extra yield on their governance tokens while allowing a governance activist to borrow more voting power and be more active on their governance system. So how does our protocol work? Basically, you can choose to ask for more voting power by just choosing how much votes you need more. For example, to launch a new protocol.
00:31:29.658 - 00:32:24.538, Speaker A: You choose your termination date, the time until you need your voting power, and you just have to pay upon the fee. You click borrow and after that you can check in your balances what are your active loans, either extend or close them and how much total value you actually had. Where it becomes really interesting is that you can actually choose any token that gives you voting power. So outside of a classical ave token, for example, you can actually stake your own ave in the safety module and stake the stake ave, which is just a token that gives you voting power. And basically that's enough for us. So if you don't intend to vote, you can add extra yield to your token. Okay, technically the way it works is that when a user deposits the tokens, it goes in a model pool.
00:32:24.538 - 00:33:40.370, Speaker A: And when another user requests to borrow some voting power, we create a loan pool dedicated to the amount of voting power that he has asked. And that's where it gets really cool. We actually don't give him the tokens, but we delegate the voting power to him, which means that we don't need any collateral in order for to accept a loan. So to summarize, Paladin is a governance lending protocol that allows non collateralized loans of voting power of any tokens granting voting power. That means that you can use maybe indexes yield, interest bearing tokens on top of the actual governance token as long as it has some voting power. With this protocol, we can actually build a much more robust governance not only by polarizing users, but also by creating, for example, automated delegates for unborrowed voting power and actually ensure a much more important and decentralized efficiency of the voting power. There are a lot of ideas behind what we can still do, but we would actually need more time and funds.
00:33:40.370 - 00:33:58.842, Speaker A: Thank you very much for listening. Amazing. Thank you so much for that. Raymond Maxim. I'll let the judges dig in and ask any questions. There's a lot of surface area here. This is extremely cool.
00:33:58.842 - 00:34:29.814, Speaker A: I like the idea of a platform basically for vote buying. I'm curious if you've thought about governance tokens with voting that don't have delegation systems built in or have locking. I'm curious kind of how you would think about potentially implementing something for Curve to support this because I still think it'd be useful there. I think feel like that'd be maybe involved a little more. Yeah, curious. Your thoughts? So to be honest, we haven't thought about Curve yet for the simple reason that we need to integrate each different token following its governance architecture. Right.
00:34:29.814 - 00:35:28.666, Speaker A: So right now we're focusing on the ones that have the delegate function and we'll think about Curve later. But I definitely agree it's going to be a big one to integrate. I could say that this is very interesting hack because traditionally the kind of like a thing with governance tokens and the discussion with voting power is that there might be a whale that comes and just puts a big collateral and borrows for good or for bad. But that's like one interesting part. So it's always been like collateralized thing, right. What we have here is the system that you actually don't need a collateral. So this is a very fascinating innovation and how it works technically.
00:35:28.666 - 00:36:17.900, Speaker A: So let's say there are people who delegate the votes to a vault because you can't redelegate, right? Or somehow once you set up this agreement, then you get to delegate from whoever you're buying, more or less. I mean, borrowing those delegated. Oh, Valentine, looks like we're not getting audio. My bad. There we go. Okay, so what we do is first, so the yield farmer just going to deposit, let's say, his Ave token on one of our pool. And so we get an RC 20 that represents how much he put in the pool and how much value he's going to get from the interest and stuff.
00:36:17.900 - 00:37:30.848, Speaker A: And when someone asks for a loan, so you say you want like 200 tokens worth of voting power, we're just going to pop a new smart contract and send those Ave token to this new smart contract and delegate. From the contract to the borrower and that way he's going to get the voting power just the amount he paid for and we can keep the tokens in a smart contract that's controlled by the pool in the protocol. Got it. So here in this case you're using basically, let's say ave tokens, not the arbit. Well, actually you can't vote for it at this moment, but let's say the idea is that you deposit the tokens, let's say all the tokens into the contract and then you make the delegation once someone is getting it right. Because we can delegate part of a balance. We need to create new small contracts to move the funds and delegate just the portion the loan asks for and not the old stacked pool we have in our protocol.
00:37:30.848 - 00:38:01.612, Speaker A: So we do that by just having lot of little small contracts that hold a certain amount and dedicates to one user. And when the user paid like for two weeks and the two weeks are done, we just kill the contract and send back our funds and the fee paid to the main pool. So we increase the interest and create values for the liquidity providers. Cool. Nice. Pretty cool. Awesome.
00:38:01.612 - 00:38:27.750, Speaker A: If there are no more comments, we'll be taking a quick three minute break for our judges. So I'll kind of have you join the second URL that's in your email. We'll be back in three minutes with the team Extra Credit presenting next. And congrats again on demoing this one Peloton. I'm particularly excited about the activist investing here that's going to happen in DeFi. So this is great. Thank you.
00:38:27.750 - 00:43:18.308, Speaker A: Amazing. All right, so we'll just put everybody on mute and turn videos off and we're back in three minutes. All right everybody, we are ready to resume and kick off with our fifth demo. So I'll just wait for all three of our judges to come back and quickly just acknowledge that they're back here as well. So I think we're waiting on Stani and then a few seconds in. That's just perfect. So all of us are here.
00:43:18.308 - 00:44:06.208, Speaker A: Let's have Tebow from Extra Credit kick off with their demo. Yeah. Hi everyone, thank you for the opportunity to present. Hi, my name is Thibo and welcome to Extract Rate, a margin lending solution where both depositors from Avi and borrowers can boost their yield farming rewards. We were driven to tackle a few challenges that currently undermine the DeFi market. The year season is rather unfair to less crypto wealthy people as the bigger your portfolio, the higher the reward in USD amount transaction fees also currently hold back market participants with smaller holdings. Lastly, the current borrowing lending infrastructure requires over sterilization to take loans and non enable you to take six to seven digit loans with a four or five digit portfolio.
00:44:06.208 - 00:44:41.500, Speaker A: At the same time. There are several opportunities to find solutions to these problems. Billions worth of funds unused sitting on protocols such as Ave, a yield farming season with two or three digits ROI being common all over the place, but also create delegation and Ave feature. Last year. A lot of depositors lazy to seek for higher yield and just leaving their funds deposited on Ave. On the other side, some farmers extremely active in finding opportunities that could benefit from a much bigger portfolio. Enters extract an application using Aaverite delegation and matching small yield farmers with large ave depositors.
00:44:41.500 - 00:45:17.732, Speaker A: Profile of Credit Delegators include people who are lacking the time to seek for a higher yield. By using our product, they will be rewarded with a boosted yield on top of the Ave deposit rate. Profile of the Yield farmers using our product are high activity at seeking the best yield in the market. They're also active at managing their yield allocation and rebalancing assets across farms. They originally have little crypto assets holdings and cannot leverage from large loans. The product works in a relative simple way. Depositors on one side deposit their a tokens to a credit pool and delegate their credit line to margin.
00:45:17.732 - 00:46:05.556, Speaker A: Borrowers on the other side interact with the margin pool that is itself connected to investments. They can interact with the investment connected to our product and need to deposit the margin amount in their margin account along with the borrower's interest rate that is used to repay the running interest on the loan. Reward allocation from the investment is dynamically computed following a rate management system that ensures durable liquidity in the system. Hi, I'm Fred from the ExtraCredit team and I'm going to show you our app. Our app is divided into the depositor side and the borrower side. Let's start with the depositors into the credit pool. Nice.
00:46:05.556 - 00:46:50.646, Speaker A: I have an event confirming the deposit. I can now have a look at my dashboard and see the top I will receive from the investment that the borrower will make. Let's have a look at the borrower side. Now. This is where extracurricular shines at its best because investors can borrow a significant amount of dai compared to the margin amount. Let's have a look. The borrowers can also choose their favorite investment platforms and the duration of the credit delegation lines.
00:46:50.646 - 00:47:39.180, Speaker A: There are some tooltips to guide you throughout the form. Once the borrower is finished, he can have a look at his dashboard and see the total borrowed amounts, his total account holdings, which includes the total margin plus the borrower amounts. He can also have a look at his reward allocation ratio, which is pretty good right now. He will receive most of the yield rewards. The sovereignty ratio looks pretty healthy since it's above the 115 limits we've put in. Thank you team. Extra Credit there's a lot going on here, so I'm sure there's going to be a handful of questions from our judges and I'll let them kick us off.
00:47:39.180 - 00:48:23.510, Speaker A: I have a question about how do you do the credit delegation? Are you locking a tokens or are you using the native credit delegation in Auba? So we are using both. So the A tokens holders deposit their A tokens to the credit pool and then they choose which amount they want to delegate out of the delegation power they have out of those eight tokens. So they have to fill two information. Yeah, that's a good solution. Actually.
00:48:30.250 - 00:48:49.046, Speaker B: It this is really cool and quite complex. If you don't mind, would you mind explaining how you sort of split the reward between the borrowers and the credit pool and how does that sort of factor into incentivizing liquidity providers as well? Am I missed that?
00:48:49.088 - 00:49:21.446, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. So the amount that was shown in the videos was actually the reward split. So we have integrated the Yarn Vault, for instance, and let's say the Dion Vault harvests like 20%. So we have a reward split out of those 20%. And for that we got inspired by the risk framework formula from Ave. So we use the same formula for the borrow rate and then we just do I mean, for the borrower side, and then we just do one minus the borrow rate for the reward that goes to the depositor side.
00:49:21.446 - 00:50:04.922, Speaker A: And then we think the combination of both would incentivize more depositors to come in if there are too many borrowers and vice versa. This is very interesting. I'm characterizing this right, but it's kind of like crowdsourcing. Effectively it ends up being large capital providers getting index fund management crowdsourced by random people. Kind of how I view it. Yeah. So I'm curious, do you think the reduction in rates that the capital providers actually get from that, do you think they'd find that worthwhile kind of outsourcing their capital allocation to Randos? I actually don't know.
00:50:04.922 - 00:51:05.150, Speaker A: That might be very valuable. Yeah, definitely. I think the risk you're right. Like the risk how do you say like the risk profile of the depositors will be important. So we'll have to make sure the platform looks as safe as possible and maybe probably some incentivization at the beginning with some extra token would be important as well. So does the risk matter? Is there some sort of margin calls, let's say? Yeah, by the way, the borrower has to deposit some margin and a small amount of the margin amount is used to pay the running interest right on the loan. And if, let's say, there is some impermanent loss coming from the investment in the vault, for instance, or in the LP, whatever, then the borrower can get immediately liquidated.
00:51:05.150 - 00:51:39.936, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Well, if there are no more calls, I want to thank for doing this demo and I hope you continue building this. Thank you. Thank you very much. With that, let's move on to our next team. And it looks like they've been promoted already, so whenever you're ready, feel free to kick off.
00:51:39.936 - 00:51:58.232, Speaker A: State your name. Yeah, here we go. Hi everyone. Welcome to my presentation for the Market maker 2021 hackathon. I'm Daniel Chilvers, and this is Stake. Your name? I originally went into this with the idea of forming a team. However, when it came to pitching my skills, I think my CV let me down a little.
00:51:58.232 - 00:52:35.264, Speaker A: This is my first hackathon, and I only started learning solidity at the beginning of this year. I've never had a GitHub account, and my only experience of Terminal was that I thought Tom Hanks was great in it, so I had to go solo. The idea for Stake Your Name came out of one of my first crypto purchases, my Ethereum name service Name, and I happened to notice that it's due to run out later this year. I wanted to renew it, but was reluctant as it would cost more in gas fees than the renewal costs. As I delayed in renewing, I realized that as the Ethereum price goes up, the amount of Ether it costs to renew your name goes down. This is because ENS prices are tight to the US. Dollar.
00:52:35.264 - 00:53:05.824, Speaker A: In fact, renewing one month ago would have cost 70% more Ether than today, and three months ago, it would have cost three times the amount. And so, Stake, your name was born. I'd estimate that 90% of this project is the solidity code itself. There's a lot going on in the background and plenty of other services it integrates with. The user isn't aware of any of this, though. They simply deposit some tokens that are stored in their own vault contract, and they can withdraw the tokens anytime if they want. They can also add an ENS name to the vault and stake your name.
00:53:05.824 - 00:53:22.400, Speaker A: We'll renew it as required. Behind the scenes, there's a lot more going on. Skip the long explanation. We deposit tokens to Aave in order to renew our ENS names. Aave gives us interest in our deposits. We check if ENS names need renewing, estimate their cost using Chainlink Oracles. We find the chainlink Oracles using ENS.
00:53:22.400 - 00:53:57.680, Speaker A: Then we check the exchange rate on one inch, verify that rate on chainlink, withdraw the tokens from Aave, exchange for Ether on one inch, pay ENS for the name, renewal all the time, grouping users by assets deposited and ENS renewal dates in order to save costs on token exchanges and transaction gas. Three weeks later okay, so this is the State your name website. I'm going to be quite brief because there isn't much to it. Let's get started. Connect our MetaMask out. I've just made a new account and gone to the forcet. We need to prove what we're about to deposit.
00:53:57.680 - 00:54:20.250, Speaker A: I'm going to stake the name Alice because that's what I use at the weekend. I just need to wait for our approval to come through. We actually have a choice of tokens. There's our approval already? Why not? Let's get our name staked. Currently, we don't actually support the other domain names. It's only ETH. But we're going to have to work on that.
00:54:20.250 - 00:54:45.036, Speaker A: Once this transaction has gone through, we will have created a vault which will deposit our 100 die as Adai. Here it is. There's our vault address. 100 die has already started accruing some interest. We've staked the name Alice is 13 days left. I'm going to help Bob out. I'm going to also help fund his name while I'm waiting for that transaction.
00:54:45.036 - 00:55:05.332, Speaker A: Let's have a look at our vault here on Ether scan, we can see it's freshly minted contract 29 seconds ago. Already. It has all the adi in there. You can read and write the contract directly because it's all verified. Let's go back. Here we go. Transactions just finished in time.
00:55:05.332 - 00:55:44.784, Speaker A: Bob has 44 days. Now, I'm not going to wait for the stakeholder in contract to do the renewal automatically, so I'm just going to go to the back end and just give it a little poke. Once that transaction goes through, we should see that Alice is within the renewal period. Her time should increase and the funds will decrease, whereas Bob will stay on 44 days because he's not within the minimum renewal period. Thanks for watching. Looking forward to any questions you may have. Daniel, this is one of the best presentations I've ever seen.
00:55:44.784 - 00:56:06.904, Speaker A: This is awesome. So congrats on a really good and consistent and concise demo, but also on doing this the first time and submitting for your first Acton. This is awesome. Thanks. I have a couple of questions, but I'll let our judges go first. Yeah, no worries. I'll just start off.
00:56:06.904 - 00:56:38.480, Speaker A: I thought this was extremely cool. My first thought is, even though this is used for ENS specifically, in this particular use case, it seems like this could be made very generic. We need to throw kind of a protocol layer of being able to pay for subscription services or this sort of stuff. Have you thought about that? Yeah, 100%. That's one thing I realized straight away is for me to automatically get the renewals once a month. I could just deposit, use my a token interest to call the Ethereum alarm service. Then once I've integrated with that, that's potentially something I could offer to the users.
00:56:38.480 - 00:56:56.570, Speaker A: So you could then deposit and instead of reading your ENS name, you could also use that to trigger an Ethereum alarm service call, to poke your contracts whenever you want, and other things. It's basically turning deposits into sort of low cost subscriptions. Like you can just manage them. Yeah.
00:57:00.960 - 00:57:24.690, Speaker B: That'S really cool. I know a bunch of teams who are looking for talented spokespeople like you, so we definitely would love to stay in touch because you're a great evangelist. You mentioned this is your first time working with Solidity. What elements did you find challenging, frustrating, liberating, joyful. How's the experience?
00:57:26.100 - 00:57:55.304, Speaker A: I think it's been like a steep learning curve. Definitely. I could have done this whole thing much easier. Like, one weekend, I just had a complete code rewrite because I was just doing stuff wrong. Just figuring out how to test net like everyone tests on their own local ganache which is what I set up originally. But then I just didn't have the integrations so I just couldn't so I ended up having to I used the Aave testnet which is absolutely fantastic on Coven. But there's no ENS testnet then? Well there is, but it doesn't do the backend renewals.
00:57:55.304 - 00:58:18.950, Speaker A: It just gives you a name for free, which is a bit annoying. And so I ended up having to simulate my own one inch, my own ENS and do all that. But then I could use Aave. And I could use Chain Link. Chain Link actually are pretty awesome on the testnets as well. I just want to say welcome to the developer community in Ethereum. Thank you.
00:58:18.950 - 00:59:04.624, Speaker A: This is basically variations of my questions have already been asked but I was curious to understand are you planning on continuing? This was actually I think there's a lot more potential for things outside of ENS as well. So I'd love to kind of see what your plans are on. Yes, I really hope to continue this. Actually with my personal circumstances, I've just decided to completely change career and just go into this and I've already had interest in the last few days because I was putting some pull requests on some other projects I was looking at and so yeah, I've totally got my first contract. I might be looking into this career so I'm not going to have so much time to do on this project because I'm going to be working for other people. But yeah, I want to continue this and hopefully get that alarm service integration and then look at some other stuff after that. Well, this is amazing.
00:59:04.624 - 00:59:38.238, Speaker A: Well, congrats and welcome to the Web Three community. Hope you continue building this and do more things beyond just this too. Thank you very much. Thanks again and thanks again for presenting. So with that we are ready to move on to our next demo and that is Team Fujibaro. And whenever you're ready, feel free to kick off with your video. Hi, we're Team Fuji and today I will introduce Fujibaro.
00:59:38.238 - 01:00:46.354, Speaker A: In the current DeFi ecosystem there has been a big focus on projects that aggregate yield earning and not much attention has been set on aggregating borrowing rates. Today, borrowing markets in DeFi appear isolated and it's not uncommon to notice significant differences between the borrowing rates across the existing lending platforms. The current imbalance in borrowing markets and the difficulty for the average user to transfer a debt position from a lending platform to another has made us determine that these are problems that should be addressed. With this in mind, we have decided to build Fujibaro. Fujibaro is the first protocol that aggregates borrowing rates from multiple lending platforms and facilitates its pool of users to constantly refinance debt to the lowest interest rate available. For purposes of this hackathon, we have created a simple proof of concept focusing only on aggregating, two lending protocols, and a single product line ETH as collateral and Dai as the borrowing asset. Fujibaro consists of five core elements a depth token contract based on ave's depth token standard, a vault, a controller, a flasher contract, and a proxy contract inspired by INSTAP for each provider.
01:00:46.354 - 01:01:32.258, Speaker A: We also use chainlink price Oracle to keep healthy collateralization ratios, and I'll explain the elements with a user story. Upon the creation of a vault, the controller calls a function that scouts the lending protocols for the current borrowing rates. The controller determines the best provider, which is then set as the active provider of the vault. Users who intend to borrow will interact with the vault contract. The vault receives users collateral and then executes the deposit and borrowing operations by using the vault's active provider. At the end of the user's transaction, the vault calls the depth token contract and updates users debt balance accordingly. When other users interact with the vault, the controller scouts the markets, and if it identifies a better rate, it sets a new provider.
01:01:32.258 - 01:02:16.110, Speaker A: The controller then calls the flasher contract, which receives funds and calls logic from the vault to transfer collateral and debt position from one provider to another. To end our user story, the depth token balances get updated, as mentioned previously, and the cycle continues. Now, let's move on to the demo. We have built a simple experimental front end enabling users to manage their debt position. First, they connect their wallet and launch the app. On the next page, they can see which is the provider currently used by the protocol, and get advice on how to keep their debt position safe. For entering a debt position in Dai, they need first to supply ETH as collateral.
01:02:16.110 - 01:03:10.294, Speaker A: We simplify users'experience by enabling them to do both actions in a single transaction. The user confirms the transaction and then receives the borrowed amount. Next, there's a dashboard where one can manage an open position in similarity to credit unions. We want Fuji users not only to benefit from the advantageous borrowing rates, but also be owners of the profit generated by the protocol. Fujibaro could greatly reduce the cost for borrowers at the micro level, but also be beneficial to the whole DeFi ecosystem by smoothing high differences in the borrowing markets and empowering the base protocols with stability. Some ideas in the near term include the concept of sub liquidations and issuing fixed rate bonds. Fujibaro is the first step in our vision to provide affordable DeFi services.
01:03:10.294 - 01:03:47.602, Speaker A: Follow us on Twitter to keep up with the project's evolution and on behalf of the Fuji team, thank you. Thank you so much. I'll let our judges ask questions before that. I just got a question for all of you. Did you know each other before the hackathon, or as you meet? Or how was it working? Like with different times and some different people. I think we used recruiting section that was organized by the ETH Global team and that's pretty much how we met. Awesome.
01:03:47.602 - 01:03:58.360, Speaker A: Well, congrats on shipping this collectively and also working together in an entirely different setting. Thanks.
01:04:03.740 - 01:04:16.430, Speaker B: This is really cool guys. Great work. Would love to hear how you're thinking about sort of developing the protocol further for application and fixed rate bonds. How would that work exactly in your mind?
01:04:18.080 - 01:06:02.830, Speaker A: So in terms of the fixed bond, the idea that we presented at the end is that we want to have also our own pool of liquidity so we can leverage positions either with the existing protocols so that we can have some liquidity on ourselves and don't rely 100% on the base protocols that will give us some security for our users. That's my way to explain it. We were thinking to because we know all the collateralization ratios of all the users and like to take the ones that have the healthiest positions and to sell bonds for the best borrowers at a rate that is probably lower and fixed in time. Yes, this is super cool. I was actually curious, I'm assuming on the back end the way the vaults work is they're kind of wrappers around CDPs. So I imagine theoretically you could expand this to any collateral type that maker actually worked with. Is that right? Would that be kind of one of the next things you guys would want to do? Yeah, I think the idea right now was just to prove that to ourselves that it works, that we could transfer positions from one platform to another.
01:06:02.830 - 01:07:16.458, Speaker A: But yeah, the idea is to grow in more tokens. I think also it's quite interesting how interest rates differ still and no one has kind of arbitrage those rates. So definitely something like this will help to settle the consumption because of course there's different reasons why rates are, let's say now lower than for example in other protocols. For example what you presented in Aave. And also there's different kinds of risk parameters involved in collaterals but it's fascinating to see how much there's difference and I think this is quite interesting, especially if you can rebalance whenever rates fluctuate. Did you guys see there is the stable rate as well in Ave and did you guys think about using it somehow? Yeah, sure. So we have created like an interface that is allowing the four basic actions like deposit, borrow, repay and withdraw.
01:07:16.458 - 01:08:01.530, Speaker A: And this interface, it will be implemented for every provider and Ave stable rate is like it could be considered like a different provider and each time the controller scouts the market, it checks also if the stable rate is better than the variable rate or the other providers. Cool, that's nice. Amazing. Awesome. Well thank you so much and congrats again on demoing and I hope you continue working on the project. Sure, thank you. With that we'll move on to our next team.
01:08:01.530 - 01:08:22.986, Speaker A: Thank you. And that is Project Phytobyte. So I think you're already here. Whenever you're ready, feel free to present. Sounds good. Hi everyone. Emily here to introduce my team's, project Fidobyte, a tokenized shelter dog walking protocol for the market make hackathon.
01:08:22.986 - 01:08:45.826, Speaker A: So before we get started, I want to take this moment to introduce ourselves. My name is Emily and my role is mainly product design and front end engineering. Everyone, my name is Andrew Hong, and for this hackathon, I mainly did solidity development and front end engineering. Hi. My name is Joseph Carrado. My role in this project was primarily as a solidity developer and database engineer. We were particularly interested in looking at animal shelters.
01:08:45.826 - 01:09:41.274, Speaker A: So shelters have a limited budget and the number of walkers have definitely been impacted as a result of the pandemic. Thus, there is an increased need to incentivize more walkers to be active on the platform. In addition, new dog walkers often have a hard time building a reputation on many of the mainstream dog walking apps, having to cut their rates in order to gain more clientele. On our platform, dog walkers can acquire badges which can help dog walkers distinguish themselves from other dog walkers after having achieved certain positive benchmarks over their dog walking history. By tokenizing the walks of shelter dogs, we are attempting to subsidize the cost of a walk for animal shelters while also helping build up a platform transferable reputation for walkers. So essentially, a shelter will register for a Wag account. Here, walker GPS data such as distance, minutes and end time will be tracked by the app and this data can be inserted through MongoDB Grabql database from the front end.
01:09:41.274 - 01:10:23.234, Speaker A: Walkers can request to be paid out walk tokens which are queried from the MongoDB's database via the use of an Oracle contract and a chainlink external adapter. After they have their tokens, they can choose between either upgrading their badge level, buying a limited edition dog toy NFT, or they can redeem one die per 100 walk tokens and this die is deposited into Ave to accrue interest while it's unused. Our tech demo of Phytobyte so here we're going to create a badge. Right now the level is zero because we don't have an account. Now that I've created a badge, it's showing a level of one. Next, we're going to claim our walk tokens. So this is based on how many walk we've done, the distance we've walked, how many dogs we've walked, the time walked.
01:10:23.234 - 01:10:59.282, Speaker A: The total payment so far is 1500 walk tokens. So let's say I just took Mochi out for another walk for 23 minutes. I'm going to insert that into the MongoDB database, which connects to a GraphQL API endpoint. In reality, the data will be inputted automatically from Wags API. So if I query the Oracle again and claim these new tokens, it's going to show, okay, that last walk gave me 25 walk tokens. I can also update my badge on the top right, this is an NFT. So right now it's showing a level of one, and after updating, it's going to show a level of three.
01:10:59.282 - 01:11:31.670, Speaker A: I can also redeem one die per 100 walk tokens. So this die is deposited in Ave while it is kind of unused to generate interest and upon redemption, then it'll withdraw the die from Ave. So here you can see I spent 500 walk tokens and got five die. Lastly, we can also buy limited edition toy NFTs so this can be redeemed at the shelter. For the actual toy. There's only 20 being sold and it costs 1000 walk tokens. So after I buy it, I can see my balance went down and it says, bought a new doggy toy.
01:11:31.670 - 01:12:15.706, Speaker A: This is all on the subgraph. And here you can see it connects from three separate contracts. Now that you've seen our tech demo, we want to show you the four main contracts that we used for our project. Feel free to pause here or can come back and ask us questions about this later for our roadmap in 2021, we're looking forward to reaching out to nearby dog shelters and dog walking platforms to better understand the market for our product. Next, we will demo Phytobyte with a set of walkers on the COVID testnet to make sure that the API and the security of the protocol is seamless. Afterwards, we will expand our NFT marketplace and look for more potential partners. And finally, pending positive feedback from potential clients, we're aiming to deploy to the Ethereum main net by summer this year.
01:12:15.706 - 01:12:34.626, Speaker A: Thank you for your time and let us know if you have any questions. Awesome. Well, that was really cool. I think you guys are putting proof of work to a whole new level. This is really nice. I think it'll even. Go, I like the NFT touch, too.
01:12:34.626 - 01:12:44.260, Speaker A: So what I'll do is I'll let our judges go in first and ask questions. But yeah, this is really fun and a really practical use case.
01:12:50.170 - 01:13:15.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think I can walk my neighbor's dog the same way anymore. I mean, that was super cute and very beautifully presented as well. So well done, guys. I think it sounds like you've got a good roadmap laid out. Have you thought about sort of extending this to other sort of physical activities aside from dog walking or how extensible do you think this is?
01:13:16.610 - 01:13:46.390, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll take that one. Yeah, we thought about it because we noticed this is a problem for many X as a service platforms. Like if you're on, for example, Instacart, at the start of Pandemic, they actually reset the reviews on all of their shoppers. So people who had been on the platform, like, years kind of generating those reviews were reset to zero and they had to cut their prices. And it was like, really hard competition. We chose animal shelters just because we saw. As kind of a two way problem of like, both the walkers have an issue as well as the shelters.
01:13:46.390 - 01:14:39.610, Speaker A: It was easier for us to start there, kind of pull both sides to a platform, but definitely can be expanded more. Haven't fully thought out what other services yet because I think the other nice thing is the fact that Wag already collects the GPS data for us, which saves on a lot of much more difficult technical implementation. Yeah, I love the design for this. It's very cute. The art is really nice, too. I'm very curious, have you done any or talked to any sort of real world dog related businesses I'm getting to and sort of curious about what their attitudes on crypto are. I guess that's kind of always my big question whenever there's these integrations with traditional or normal style businesses, how they feel about crypto, if they're weirded out by it or they're excited by the prospect.
01:14:39.610 - 01:15:31.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's where we're planning on kind of taking this to the Brooklyn Animal Care Center where I adopted Mochi and also I used to do Wagwalking so I can try to find some people there. The plan is just to pitch it to them and see what they say. They're eager to just be like, what am I looking at? Or they might be like, all right, what is this going to cost? But yeah, we're interested in that too because it's like we're looking into how do we bridge kind of web two into web3? Because it feels like there's a lot of web two applications that could be bridged it's just finding the easiest way to get it done once and then other platforms will probably be like, okay, now we can copy that. I have no idea what they're going to say. I love the kind of tokenization of toys. That's super awesome. It's interesting to see.
01:15:31.660 - 01:16:03.314, Speaker A: There could be all kinds of things you could develop on that. That's a pretty nice thing. I would love to buy something if you guys continue also, that part of the roadmap. There's a lot of dogs in our family as well. That's a way to support as well. Yeah, we were also looking at try to integrate dogs into Avagashi in some way. If we could basically take a shelter's dog and put it in there, that would be cool.
01:16:03.314 - 01:16:49.006, Speaker A: Yeah, but we were looking into that, but we didn't have enough time to kind of test all of that out. But definitely trying to think of like the NFT side would be where most of the expansion would be. That is really cool. Well, I think not only just, I think you already said it, which is finding more easier way to bridge web two and web3, I think is where things are headed, I think just for the next few months and this year just layer twos and just more normalization of how stable coins are used in day to day lives. I think all that will make it a lot more possible. So if you are choosing to continue working on this thing, there'll be a lot of opportunities to make this appealing to everybody who is not directly into crypto. So congrats again, and hopefully this gets into Avagatchi and we can get some nice NFDS.
01:16:49.006 - 01:17:16.490, Speaker A: Thank you. Perfect. So thanks again for presenting. We are at the halfway point now, and what we'll be doing is we'll just be taking a five to ten minute break for all of our judges, and we'll just be resuming in a few minutes from there. So maybe one quick thing I'll do is I'll have all of our judges just join the other link for a couple of minutes, and then we'll be back here in five to ten minutes after the break. So thanks, everybody. Appreciate all of your patience.
01:17:16.490 - 01:23:46.130, Speaker A: You okay, everyone? We're just waiting a minute or two. I am the returning MC. I'm Andrew from ETH Global, taking over for CarTech. Thanks, everyone. We'll just take a minute or two more till the next team is ready. Stand by. All righty, and the next team is called Therald.
01:23:46.130 - 01:24:14.502, Speaker A: If you can start your screen share and start your demo, we shall begin. Hello, guys. What's up? Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, so here's the video. This presentation can be quick and not long. Okay. Due to technical issues, this is not the we're having some audio trouble.
01:24:14.502 - 01:25:17.040, Speaker A: There the error ID of our day to day life. We have to have them with us at all times, and they shouldn't be able to. ID is an ERC, since one that represents an individual's ID. People should be presentable with this extra layer of identification. This form of individuality human and crypto identification would benefit security. So the stores or the location were presentable. KYC reasons we would issue IPFS, it would look something like this.
01:25:17.040 - 01:26:06.526, Speaker A: We could create various utilities around the CRC 721. One use case that I'm presenting here would be this yearly Halloween theme. In this case, the users would have to have this era idea wallet, and they would be for their costume. In this case, ghost. But we don't know yet. Right? We should validate these votes. Can Yarn validate these votes? And this should change.
01:26:06.526 - 01:27:07.982, Speaker A: Yeah, it's already recharging. And now Ghost is waiting this out with 65 accounts. This is for showing the minting of these tokens. Can be done on Mumbai or Matic. And I think that's about it. For this demo, the minting would be direct to the address, and we would give it a token ID, and then we would just pass in the JSON the location of the token and change the photo. In this case, we would redo design for each person at the moment of launching to Pinata or whichever IPFS program would be preferable at the time of launch.
01:27:07.982 - 01:27:41.870, Speaker A: But this would be it. And I think that's the main idea. Some example cases would be organization for simple meatball and chicken Friday. You could organize your votes with your employees, with the console. You can have specific data IDs in the console and you guys would have the voting power of this. And Terra ID could also be used to choose your next employee. So you can make modes on which employee you prefer.
01:27:41.870 - 01:29:06.960, Speaker A: I think that's about it. I hope you guys like this idea and how we can change world. All right, thanks. I had a little bit of audio issues, so I don't know if everyone else did, but if you can open up to questions now from the judges sure. Definitely a bit of audio issues, but in essence so if I understood it's an ID and you can practically mint like ERC 71 I ah, well, it needs to be I think we're having some audio issues again there. First thing that we got to do is security. Oh yeah.
01:29:06.960 - 01:29:34.758, Speaker A: There is a great amount of lag. We hear one word and then the word drags. It's very difficult. What about now? Is it better? Yeah. Okay, sorry. Brazilian amazon rainforest internet. Yes, literally.
01:29:34.758 - 01:30:37.502, Speaker A: So we would have to really organize stores or gift shops to actually start organizing this into a fourth industrial revolution like city. So in this case, all of the cases we would have to pass in through a strong KYC before actually transferring this particular unique, exclusive ERC 721. So there would be actually kind of like an organization where you put in the documents. The documents are seen by the person passed on to another one that designs. The person takes a photo of the person at the moment, and after that execution he receives his 721 by the minter of that center of that center point. So I believe that we could organize this and then use I didn't have time to actually hack totally Ave Governance, but I really wished because until yesterday I was practicing this ERC 721 ID and ERC 1155. So let's say a population of a city is 2.5
01:30:37.502 - 01:31:02.018, Speaker A: million. We would generate just not the Terry ID, but the 1155. And these two would be like the entry points into using Ave Governance. And then maybe we can have an extra security stamp there before taking any loans out by normal people or anything like that. So I didn't have time to hack your incredible Ave system. Totally. Congratulations Sandy.
01:31:02.018 - 01:31:40.386, Speaker A: The math is incredible. I didn't have time for that, but I was just checklisting before doing all of that with normal people. Sometimes we're talking about people that don't even know what Internet is. So if we give them such a strong and powerful system in their hands, the checklisting to usage should be passed on. So I was actually thinking about that when I developed the I started planning the Terra idea and I got to this point that's pretty cool. Yeah, I think there's sort of potential. It's always difficult data storing after the KYC and how to make it.
01:31:40.386 - 01:32:02.746, Speaker A: But one interesting thing about KYC usually is how to reuse it. You do it once and don't have to do it again. And you have this tokenization, your system into one. That's something that's interesting development. Thank you. It's very cool. I'm always curious about this.
01:32:02.746 - 01:32:47.000, Speaker A: People who build systems related to identification, voting. What are your thoughts on vote buying and delegation? Would your system try to create systems to prevent it? Or in your mind, should the system instead embrace it? Well, the system is the people, and you got to believe in the people. So when we're talking about governance and decentralized governance, you have to also account for the human being, the human behind the token. So we have to really understand society, and that's why we're given this power. We are given this power as developers to enhance people's lives. And we have to understand that the people in the end are going to be the users. So I can't promise things like that.
01:32:47.000 - 01:33:27.538, Speaker A: That's an educational point. Then we have to talk about crypto education and how to use these tokens and measure the education of the children. And all of that is possible because they're going to have the ERC 721 that's totally KYC and that's like something that you can use as information, maybe. So, yeah, it's a go point. We have to start smart cities at one point. And I really believe that this is the go to point where people can just have on the Matic network or Mumbai test network, the IDs, and they have this extra security, like, okay, give me your IDs, give me this. Okay, now show me your electronic ID.
01:33:27.538 - 01:33:52.902, Speaker A: And the person has it in the MetaMask. So I think that's actually the point of the project, using technology that is there, that's been developed by extremely well developed teams and just mashing it up together to create the society there. I think it's possible. I see it happening. So that's the idea. And that puts us at time. Thank you, Andrew.
01:33:52.902 - 01:34:09.090, Speaker A: Thank you so much. That was super cool and glad to see you're down there in the rainforest staying connected. We got to try to do something. Take care. Bye bye. Bye. Our next team is fiber.
01:34:09.090 - 01:34:59.950, Speaker A: Please share your screen and start your video. Remember to share audio. We're not getting any audio. If you could unshare and restart your Share screen and then before you go all the way through in the zoom, after you hit Share screen, you hit Share computer audio. Sorry about that, guys. No problem. We are Team Fiber and this is our Market Make 2021 hackathon submission.
01:34:59.950 - 01:35:50.640, Speaker A: Our team consists of two people ben, who worked on the web, three data and Logic, the serverless backend and the React application, and myself, Callum. I worked on graphics and UI design, as well as the Price Data API integration. Together, we built Faba, a flash loan analytics tool for displaying Flash loans in real time. Faber offers an easy to interpret summary of what happened in each flash loan transaction. Real time data and interpretability are the core elements of Fiber's security and analytics. Value Proposition faber was designed with two groups of users in mind. The first are DeFi protocol teams who need to understand how Flash loans interact with their protocol's contracts in real time.
01:35:50.640 - 01:36:26.700, Speaker A: Fava aims to be a security monitoring tool for these teams. The second group is anyone doing on chain analytics. Fava aims to deliver understandable data in real time, helping to understand what Flash loans are being used for on the network, which may be important in an investment thesis. I will now go through our product demonstration. This is the fiber app. The most important part is the Flash loan feed. This feed displays Flash loans in real time as soon as Fiber detects them.
01:36:26.700 - 01:37:34.080, Speaker A: Flash loan cards contain an overview of the Flash loan, including the date and time it executed, the loan amount in US dollars, the assets that were borrowed, the transaction hash, the block number and the sender address, all of which are clickable and will take you to the correct page on Etherscan. The card also includes a list of icons illustrating the smart contracts that the Flash loan interacted with. We currently show icons for popular ERC 20 assets, a tokens, the two versions of Ave's lending pool contract and various uniswap pools. The search feature lets a user quickly find all the Flash loans that have interacted with a specific. Just copy in the contract's address and click Search. We're currently building up Fiber's library of Historic Flash loan data, which will make the searching, filtering and more advanced analytics possible. If you want to return to the standard live feed after a search, just click the reset button.
01:37:34.080 - 01:38:30.920, Speaker A: A user can also quickly jump to Historic Flash loans by using the page button. And finally, there are two useful indicators at the top of the app to confirm that things are running smoothly. First, a check to see if a WebSocket connection to the network has been established, and second, to confirm the app is up to date with the latest block on the network. This leads us to Fiber's roadmap. Firstly, we currently only support Ave V Two Flash loans, but are working on supporting V One Flash loans as well. Secondly, we want to add deeper analytics and auto categorization of each Flash loan. And finally, Fiber will soon offer customizable alerts for DeFi teams to help them respond to unexpected Flash loans interacting with their protocols.
01:38:30.920 - 01:39:33.454, Speaker A: If you feel like Aping into our beta release of Faber, you can put your email addresses on our mailing list here and we'll reach out when Faber is ready for its first users. That was awesome. Thanks. Open to questions now I think I'd say this is exactly area that there is a lot of potential. I think there isn't enough tools at the moment to analyze things on chain and secondly to provide kind of like tools for the DeFi protocols and the teams and whoever are the stakeholders. And I think it's quite nice that you could actually see flash loans. And probably there's other kind of interactions, as you guys mentioned, that you are adding more support, especially like notifications and getting those notifications all the way.
01:39:33.454 - 01:40:32.750, Speaker A: Into SMS practically many themes has very kind of like I would say like various ways to the wire, die wall drainage, the exploit I probably got it like two minutes after it happened or 1 minute after it happened, but I didn't monitor anything like that. So I got it from someone else and I happened to be awake. But especially if it's Oracle protocol, you need to get the information as soon as possible to mitigate. So these kind of tools are heavily important and extremely underdeveloped area. So it was very happy to and this kind of product will have a long roadmap if you thanks Danny. Super cool. I want to look at this now actually and read through them.
01:40:32.750 - 01:41:31.490, Speaker A: I'm curious, just what kind of additional information would you guys think about adding next to the Flash loan analysis? So we really want to focus on, I think, primarily the security aspect of it and chatting to DeFi teams, especially those with high TVL in their protocols and probably loop in the auditors as well and obviously build in. The real time alerts so that we can then alert firstly the teams and the multi SIG signers who need to act on this and maybe tweak parameters and shut down vaults. For example. But then once we've got that, to sort of identify and flag Flash loans that do pose a threat when interacting with these smart contracts versus ones that are perhaps harmless.
01:41:39.610 - 01:42:13.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is amazing and like Stani said, anytime something like this happens, it's just like an hour down the rabbit hole, even from technical people. So totally appreciate that it's best used as a monitoring tool and can really improve the security of DeFi protocols. But I think there's a big educational element as well just making this very readable to common DeFi participants so they're also aware of the risk as consumers and users of protocol. So great job.
01:42:14.530 - 01:43:07.620, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, that was actually one thing we thought of after we made the presentation, is if we could manage to interpret each Flash loan and then sort of decode it into a more natural language description, it could one be very useful to analysts and teams on the security front, but it could also be used as an educational tool. And perhaps as a side thing, we could build out kind of an educational series of how one can go about doing their own Flash loans. Yeah. For example, the Y Die Vault, it had practically over 160 different transactions and 875 percent of the whole block. That one particular action transactions. So definitely that will be something very useful, especially if you can get others to contribute to explain.
01:43:07.620 - 01:43:26.790, Speaker A: That's awesome, that's great. We're at time again, but thanks so much for sharing. That was cool. Thanks, guys. Our next team is Team Devix. If I said that right, that's correct. We got it right.
01:43:26.790 - 01:43:29.510, Speaker A: And just share your screen. Remember to share audio.
01:43:39.550 - 01:44:26.534, Speaker C: DeFi lacks tools to protect against and trade volatility. This is problematic because it's difficult to hedge portfolios or hedge impermanent loss, or even just speculate on volatility. This is why we made Devix. Devix, or Decentralized volatility index, is a protocol that allows for the building of model free, near real time volatility index feeds of any decentralized or centralized asset that has a robust derivatives market. Using D VIX, we made an ETH volatility index feed and a BTC volatility index feed. You can see these live at DViX IO. To calculate the volatility feeds, we pull real time options data from Derabit and Exchange, and interest data from Ave.
01:44:26.534 - 01:45:26.830, Speaker C: Once we have the data, Devix then calculates volatility using a modified CBOE VIX formula, the current gold standard. The methodology of the calculation can be found in our GitHub repo. We also designed two simple tools for the Uma data verification mechanism so that anyone can verify the feed or the saved data. Technical users can make a simple API call, and non technical users can input the values into a spreadsheet that calculates the index. Here you can see that I simply just paste the data into the spreadsheet. This is all of the databit options data, and it automatically calculates the Ethvix index with these simple ways for users to verify the calculation and with the live index feeds, DViX is perfect for making synthetic tokens on Uma. The best part about D VIX is that you can make volatility feeds and tokens for non crypto assets.
01:45:26.830 - 01:46:01.286, Speaker C: With all the hype these past several weeks, think how incredible it would have been to trade volatility on GameStop or AMC or silver. D VIX will give users a decentralized way to do this, and quickly. We do have the synthetics from Uma on COVID right now, but they're not in our video. We were waiting on the price Identifier to be approved by their team. And also, the BTC VIX tracked the huge price movement this morning when Tesla announced that they were buying.
01:46:01.398 - 01:46:21.582, Speaker A: All right, now I think we're back in business, guys. I really appreciate that. That's great. Let's open it up to questions. This is awesome. This is another one. I really, actually like to use this.
01:46:21.582 - 01:46:53.000, Speaker A: I actually tried to get in I have a question related to the mention of synthetic assets. I tried to get in on synthetic silver using SNX, actually, and I did. But I was interested in the fact that basically their counterparty is sort of just a giant pool of liquidity. So in this system. Who exactly would the counterparty be for such a thing? Like say I wanted to take a position on volatility of silver. Would that just be somebody else in the market or is there like a specific liquidity provider for it?
01:46:53.370 - 01:47:20.690, Speaker C: Somebody else in the market. So basically the way we have these structured now is that if you want to short volatility, you're going to put up the collateral. So if you think the asset is not going to be volatile, you'd put up the collateral and you'd mint the token and then sell it on uniswap. And to kind of really kind of make that feasible, we have a very short duration for our tokens right now. So one week out. We thought if we put it out 30 days that with the volatility of the space nobody would want to put up the collateral.
01:47:22.150 - 01:47:48.262, Speaker A: Makes a lot of sense. I think that makes a lot more sense actually than synthetics. They're infinite liquidity. Confused me. This is much more reasonable. Yeah. So practically one thing is interesting, like trading the interest rate volatility.
01:47:48.262 - 01:48:02.080, Speaker A: And you mentioned the average that you guys are using, but that's not actually the trading of the volatility of also the interest rates. Or was that also kind of like.
01:48:02.530 - 01:48:31.740, Speaker C: There to calculate the VIX formula? When they calculated on the S and P 500, they used the T bill interest rate, the treasury rate. And so you need to understand what the rate is, the risk free rate, to be able to calculate what the volatility will be. So if I were to have just placed that ethereum into a bay to earn interest, what is that rate over the 14 day period? And that goes into our calculation to understand how volatile it is.
01:48:32.510 - 01:49:23.174, Speaker A: Yes, very interesting. Have you considered actually also that you could trade the volatility on interest rates itself because they do fluctuate quite a lot in DeFi, usually because of some farms or something, but there is sort of fluctuation. It's totally possible to trade really the volatility of practically any asset. However, the way that the kind of CBOE VIX formula is designed, it's all based on derivatives. So unless there's an active derivatives market for the asset, it's not really possible to calculate volatility in this particular model. That said, we're going to do different indexes in different models. So right now we're using a model free calculation modality that's built by the CBOE.
01:49:23.174 - 01:50:05.570, Speaker A: It's kind of the gold standard as we said in the video, but we're looking at lots of other mechanisms including black shoals and lots of GARCH style models. There's lots of different ways to calculate volatility and we're going to touch on a lot of them over the weeks and months. Could be also funny to trade volatility on rebased tokens. Yeah, that would be interesting for sure. All right, just about puts us at time if there are no more questions. That was really cool. Much appreciated.
01:50:05.730 - 01:50:06.422, Speaker C: Thank you, everyone.
01:50:06.476 - 01:50:35.010, Speaker A: Thanks for all the work. Thanks, guys. Our next team is Crypto portfolio DeFi token. You guys can share your screen and we'll feel free to go. Hello, everyone. I'd like to demo my work so far. This is not a complete working app or fully functional smart contract just yet.
01:50:35.010 - 01:51:39.910, Speaker A: So my idea was to create an account would represent a portfolio of tokens, whether it represents an index of leading tokens by market capitalization or tokens from a given industry, such as DeFi or privacy tokens. I use Scaffold ETH exclusively to create the token and deploy the extt token to the Covan testnet. I also use Scaffold ETH lend to add the token to the Ave lender platform. Austin Griffith and Adam Fuller were very helpful in putting me on the right path and using the right tools that I needed to do that. Unfortunately, with the Ave Lender platform, I wasn't able to list the extt token. I was just about to do that. I kind of ran out of time toward the end.
01:51:39.910 - 01:52:44.596, Speaker A: So let's take a look at a demo of the okay, if you recall, Austin did a video tutorial with us about a week and a half ago, two weeks ago, and he showed us how to distribute the token to a vendor, which was very cool, and then have it run on Covent. So here we've got the exchange traded token. Its symbol, its total supply is ten E. And here's our vendor here. So in my wallet up here, I have almost four E, three and change, almost four. So that would allow me to buy up to that much amount of extt from the vendor. So I'm going to use one ETH.
01:52:44.596 - 01:53:19.588, Speaker A: I'm going to buy one ETH's worth. Let's see how that goes. So we're going to click send over here. Going to bring up the old MetaMask, confirm it. It's going to go through the Covan blockchain, which we all know is wicked fast. And if you look at our total, we now have one ETH additional of the extt token. All right.
01:53:19.588 - 01:54:01.270, Speaker A: If I had a bit more time, I believe I would have explored, uma's, synthetic tokens. I was just about to look into that. I found out about that last week. And I also would have tied in chainlink Oracles into the mix for pricing. So when we were talking about the portfolio of different tokens, within that portfolio token, the chain link Oracles would have been really nice to update the pricing of the underlying instruments that were inside of the token that I was creating. But I guess that's for another time. Okay, everybody, thank you so much for watching.
01:54:01.270 - 01:54:14.430, Speaker A: All right. Thanks, John. Open it up to questions.
01:54:18.260 - 01:54:46.520, Speaker B: Thank you, John, for this. Thanks, Alex. This is really know. I can see the convenience factor being a really big draw for a lot of, like, could you maybe share if you had a bit more time? What are some other things that you would want to add to the project and some other features that you want to build going forward. And is this something that you want to explore further?
01:54:47.100 - 01:55:43.320, Speaker A: Sure. Looking at all of the other presentations, it looks like fixed income instruments. Packaging them together into one token would have been a fantastic use for it and a really good fit for the Ave lending platform. I could actually envision Maturities from short term maturities, like a token that had those loans in it medium term and then longer term tokens. So you could capitalize on the convenience for somebody who may not be as experienced in the crypto world as we are. Yeah, I agree as well. And also it's pretty cool that he used these capability.
01:55:43.320 - 01:56:48.220, Speaker A: I think Austin pretty much did it for this hackathon or somehow wanted to at least release for now to make it easier to kind of like bootstrap development on Ethereum. So it was amazing that you actually used that. And definitely that practically having kind of a basket is a good way to start something, to build something. And it's quite fascinating, and I agree on this is something very much needed. Fixed Loans and Borrows and Fixed Income v five. Just want to say very cool. I'm just curious, for a first batch, what sort of tokens would you think of putting in such an index? I think I would probably do they would have to be, ERC, 20 so that I could use Uniswap and I could use Ave.
01:56:48.220 - 01:57:58.550, Speaker A: So I would think maybe a basket of DFI tokens might be the best idea because if you had to switch in and out of positions and using uniswap, it would be one platform that you could pretty much do all of them with. So that would be my first choice. That's great. That's awesome. Sorry about that. Can I ask you guys one quick question? Do I have time? Yes. What do you think, what platform might be the best out of everything that was supported in this hackathon? Which do you something like well, I can't say much because obviously it's good, but you mean the fixed loans or which specifically I'm sorry, say it one more time.
01:57:58.550 - 01:58:34.672, Speaker A: Were you referring to the fixed loans? Fixed loans. Everything that we were taught. Like we used Matic. We use Scaffold e. Yeah. Which of those do you think would be the best fit into Aave? Let's say I were to take it in the direction of doing fixed income instruments in the token, packaging them. I think having in layer two, like in Maddox could be interesting thing if you package them and people can trade them because those things, the more frequently you trade, the more frequent interest rate you have.
01:58:34.672 - 01:58:45.284, Speaker A: So I think that's quite interesting. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you, John. Appreciate it. That was cool.
01:58:45.284 - 01:59:01.160, Speaker A: Our next team is Team EBT. I think you. Guys are already promoted and feel free to share. Great. So can everybody hear me? Just mic check. This is Eli. Yes.
01:59:01.160 - 01:59:29.860, Speaker A: Awesome. So what I have here is a bunch of food stamps. So these are actual Paper food stamps. So in the US. There's like 22% of the population that live on food stamps and they still use paper. And there's like $128,000,000,000 that's going through this system. And one of the problems with the food stamp system is that you can't shop online, you can't do any digital transactions.
01:59:29.860 - 02:00:22.708, Speaker A: It's still a paper system. So I grew up on food stamps and we got a bunch of hackers together that were passionate about social impact and we said, let's build a solution that takes food stamps into Ethereum world and let's figure out a better way how to build the whole food stamp system for the US. So that's what we worked on. And Tony's going to give a quick demo on what we came up with on how do we go from paper to something that they can use digitally. So go for the demo, Tony. The first thing the user will do is to import their EBT card into our applications and they will see the total balance and all the card information right here. So they have the option to send the money to their friends and family members.
02:00:22.708 - 02:01:01.010, Speaker A: And also they can see all the transactions that's happening in their EBT account. On the right we can see the account summary. So the user will have the option to take their EBT money and convert it into a stable coin fract. Or they can invest their money into Ethereum. So for example, they have $3,300 in EBT and they invest in $100 in Ethereum and they convert $100 to a stable coin. And because the volatility of Ethereum price, they will have the rate of return around like 3.5%, for example.
02:01:01.010 - 02:01:37.884, Speaker A: And now let's look at the swap functionality. So here's the main page where users can perform swaps. So they'll first select on the top the token that they want to switch from and then on the bottom they select the token they want to switch into. So then they can enter the amount. Note that the exchange rate is applied automatically here and when they click swap, it props succeed. And then we see the account details updated accordingly. We also implemented a demo function of transfer.
02:01:37.884 - 02:02:11.910, Speaker A: So we use a MetaMask account and we import an account from Ganesh with some free users. So when the user want to send money to someone, they first enter the address and the amount they want to send. Once they hit submit, it would take them to MetaMask transactions. And once we confirm the transactions, you can see the balance is updated and the money is sent to that address. So this is our demo and thank you for your time. Awesome. Let's open it up to questions.
02:02:11.910 - 02:03:19.820, Speaker A: Well, hello and welcome to another LinkedIn Live Q A, where I'm delighted to be joined by Richard Marsden, who is the co founder and director of a new company called True North Digital. How are we doing, Richard? I think I muted that. I think we're back know hear what you guys think about this. It yeah, I think it's an amazing idea because I still don't understand. We have a lot of legacy stuff in finance, but it's crazy how much legacy we have in government stuff. Where from I come from Finland. We don't have food stamps, but we definitely have different kinds of similar purchase coupons.
02:03:19.820 - 02:04:13.516, Speaker A: If you, as a family, purchase something big and you need to get this coupon from welfare, and everything is paper. And also, even with the COVID and everything, we see things getting digitalized, but it's still very legacy. So I think this kind of idea is wonderful. And when this idea is taken further and polished very well, this is something they can actually go and pitch to governments in local I don't know how is this like food stamps? A federal shame? I have no idea. But this could be something quite interesting. It requires sort of work to get it exactly what the governments want, but there is sort of potential in the future, and I think the impact cost here is amazing. Yeah.
02:04:13.516 - 02:04:55.800, Speaker A: So this is like a real problem that's right now affecting lots of people. And that's why we said we wanted to build something people want. And people on food stamps, all they want to be able to do is increase power, be able to shop digitally. And we said instead of just giving them a virtual card like on Visa or let's just jump them, leapfrog them all the way into crypto. And then we even had another couple of cool ideas. Maybe there's, like, a way we can off of every transaction they do. They can start converting money into a savings account, whether that's FRAX or Ethereum or FX.
02:04:55.800 - 02:05:04.430, Speaker A: We were looking at coins and we were looking into Ethereum, but yeah, Tony might have some ideas, too.
02:05:12.320 - 02:05:42.890, Speaker B: Yeah, this is really cool, guys. Great out of the box thinking, solving very intractable societal problems. And I really like the digital access angle as well. Do continue advocating for it. And it kind of reminds me a little bit of pull together in a lot of ways, too, where you can just take small amounts, and the power of compounding is such that a small amount could be a big amount one day. So love the direction that you're taking this.
02:05:47.990 - 02:06:12.074, Speaker A: Okay, go ahead. This is very interesting. I'm curious if you give any I just want to make sure sorry about that. I just want to make sure Tony got a sentence in because I didn't want to hog up all of the time because he's a great no, no, go ahead. I think yeah, go ahead. Okay. Yeah, I just had a question.
02:06:12.074 - 02:07:16.702, Speaker A: I was curious if you've given any thoughts like how you would build an admin functionality, I guess for the state, for the token, since a lot of the way, the EBT and the food stamp systems work is specifically built to make it difficult to transfer them to other people or sell them or do anything interesting with them. Yeah, so the food stamp problem is a big problem that has a bunch of different aspects that we did not focus on. What we wanted to focus on is what the users feedback we got. And the users, they just want to be able to shop online, increase their purchasing power, and kind of like get into digital money. So the government hasn't done anything good for the program in the last 20 years. They've disenfranchised the poor and the financial system is rigged so that they stay poor. So we said, well, if we were to reinvent the whole food stamp system, where would we reinvent it on? And we'd do it on ethereum.
02:07:16.702 - 02:07:44.090, Speaker A: That's where we would do it on. So we think we give the technology to people and then the people, they can administer their food stamps the best way as long as it adheres to the rules and regulations within the food stamps. No alcohol, no tobacco, no other illicit products, things like that. But that's pretty doable. That's awesome. It's an awesome idea. I'm so glad you guys presented it.
02:07:44.090 - 02:08:10.558, Speaker A: We're at time for this presentation, but really appreciate it. Great work, guys. We're down to our last two teams, so we'll just press on without another small break, if that's okay. Our next team is Ave credit delegation. Share your screen and we can go. I'm viraj anchan for the market make hackathon. I worked on Aave credit delegation.
02:08:10.558 - 02:08:46.590, Speaker A: Ave Credit Delegation allows a depositor to deposit funds in the Ave Protocol to earn interest and delegate borrowing power to other users. Here. Delegator first deposits an asset to the Ave protocol. He then delegates the credit to the delegate. Hence, Delegate can borrow an asset from the Ave protocol. It entirely depends on Delegator, on how we want to handle this. If Delegator trust the delegate, then he would not take any collateral.
02:08:46.590 - 02:09:59.854, Speaker A: However, there's also an option for the Delegator to use off chain assets provided by the delegate as collateral. Hence, Credit Delegation democratizes DeFi by allowing people to collateralize their off chain assets to get exposure to the on chain assets. Now let me quickly show you a demo for Aave Credit Delegation on the homepage. The Delegator first deposits an asset to the Ave Protocol is successful. Then the Delegator would enter the address of Delegate over here. Then he'll select the rate I've selected stable. Then he'll enter the amount that we delegated here.
02:09:59.854 - 02:11:28.258, Speaker A: I'll enter 100, and for the token I will select Die. Then I'll click on delegate credit. The repay was successful. The subsequent improvements to this would be adding layer two support adding support for gasoline transactions and adding more features which would be useful for delegator and delegate example grouped credit delegation. This concludes the demo for Awe credit delegation. Thanks. Thank you, varash and team.
02:11:28.258 - 02:12:16.110, Speaker A: Let's open up to questions. I can start by saying that this is an interesting development because credit dedication has been available in the protocol protocol, but then you practically have to resolve it yourself by going to Etherscan and finding everything you want to need. So practically, this is the only user interface to do great delegations seamlessly. So pretty cool that you made this effort and provided that user interface. It looked pretty simple. And probably also you learned during this experience, at least, about great delegation.
02:12:16.530 - 02:12:17.050, Speaker B: Yeah.
02:12:17.140 - 02:12:43.560, Speaker A: How the entire flow works and say, I could even promote this and explain this to other non technical users. Exactly. So I think that was a good thing. Thanks. Have you hacked before on Ethereum or is this like, completely new thing for you? No. I've hacked before on ethereum. Cool.
02:12:43.560 - 02:12:48.060, Speaker A: Nice. Thanks.
02:12:55.340 - 02:13:08.750, Speaker B: This is really cool. And could you maybe think about some use cases where people would want to use this, which might prompt integration with any sort of projects that you might have in mind?
02:13:09.360 - 02:13:35.220, Speaker A: So the place where I think this would be useful is like, people have a lot of assets off chain and they couldn't reach out to a person. You could have more features like group chat and maybe location based discovery, et cetera, which would allow them to find other people who are willing to delegate the credit. Like, say, for example, they don't want to go to an exchange to gain exposure to DeFi. So this is a credit delegation would be very useful.
02:13:36.220 - 02:13:41.528, Speaker B: Yeah, got it. Definitely. I could see that working out. This is cool. Good job.
02:13:41.694 - 02:14:17.080, Speaker A: Thanks. Yeah, very cool demo. I'm just curious, what would you add next to it? Group based credit delegation and maybe gatlin transactions and layer to support. That's cool. Thanks. That's great. Looks like if there are no more questions, awesome presentation.
02:14:17.080 - 02:14:57.384, Speaker A: Really appreciate the work and thanks a lot. Thanks, Andrew. We're now down to the final team of our session today. This is Team Zygo. Please feel free to share and we can start. Hello, my name is James Dawson, and today I'll be introducing my hackathon submission, Zygo Finance. So what is Zygo Finance? Zygo Finance is a fully decentralized priceless trading platform that was heavily inspired by the Uma Protocol.
02:14:57.384 - 02:15:54.504, Speaker A: Zygo uses a network of bots and both an on chain ordering system and an on chain settlement to create a seamless trading experience. Zygo Protocol incentivizes the bots to make orders on behalf of other users by rewarding them with the Zygo token and thus allowing us to create a fully decentralized limit ordering system that uses no price oracle. The bots will monitor trades coming in and the price of the current orders. And when the bot determines that the order will be profitable, including the Zygo token. They will execute the order on the user's behalf. Now we'll quickly go on to the demo which I will show you the kind of ordering system in action. So here we will select some EV and we will place an order for one EV and we want in exchange for our One E of 1000 die.
02:15:54.504 - 02:17:29.736, Speaker A: So once we approve both these tokens, we will send the One EF to the Zygua Protocol which will be held in escrow. And once we that gets approved and I lose my buttons, that'll be sent out and then the order will actually be published on the blockchain that says this order wants one e of 2000 die. And the bots will monitor that order coming in and the price of EV to die. And once the actual price reaches what is stated in the order, the bots will execute the order because they will send 1000 die to the Zygo Protocol, they will receive the one EV that was locked in and they will receive the Zygo token as their incentive for processing the order on someone else's behalf. And this opens up a lot of really interesting and cool things that we can do with having fully decentralized on chain orders. Allows us to actually use the actual funds to invest in Eaves lending pool. Which you can see what I've done here is that actually while your order is waiting to be filled, you can actually earn interest on your limit orders.
02:17:29.736 - 02:18:10.010, Speaker A: As you can see that we've done here, all of these orders are earning interest on their while they are waiting to be filled. So if you do a long term limit order of, let's say you want to buy wrapped bitcoin at 1000 die, that might take years if not ever happen. But you have $10,000 now, you could be earning interest while also having that limit order being placed. And that is essentially the Zygo protocol. And I just like to say thank you very much to the ETH Global team and yeah, I'll hope to see you soon. Bye bye. Hey guys.
02:18:10.010 - 02:18:13.130, Speaker A: Thanks James. Open up for questions.
02:18:17.040 - 02:18:35.632, Speaker B: This is really neat just thinking through it. Have you considered sort of like what it would take to sort of add any sort of time limit order and if they like that thousand WBTC has just never felt, is there a way to sort of recover it?
02:18:35.766 - 02:19:21.680, Speaker A: Yeah, you can cancel any order and retrieve your funds and the interest that you've earned because the orders themselves are nothing more than just data stored on chain it's. The bots are doing all of the price checks and they actually have the ability to use any liquidity pool that they want to they're not trapped into. It has to be done in uniswap or has to be done this. So it's like you can cancel orders immediately and get all your money back and things. You'll lose your zygo fee. There's a fee to actually put to create orders which is Zygo and that is what essentially funds the system and the kind of tokenomics that would go to the bots who fill orders.
02:19:22.580 - 02:19:30.290, Speaker B: Understood. Maybe like a follow up from that. I'm just like thinking about do you see any sort of surface area for market manipulation of any sort?
02:19:33.880 - 02:20:43.800, Speaker A: I think it is reasonably foolproof. But there is one price oracle that is used which to determine the cost of Zygo to weath and that is gotten from the uniswap pair, the V two pair. So I use like a simple moving average to just get that current price ratio and then what the Zygo protocol will do to ensure that bots will always be incentivized to actually fill orders during high gas. It calculates how much gas the fill has cost and it will transfer that in and give you extra Zygo to compensate you. Because if the gas fees are like 300 guay, the minimal Zygo reward is not going to be enough. You need more to make sure that orders will always be filled regardless of gas price. But that's the only kind of outsourcing kind of price manipulation that I think but yeah, need to be audited to be foolproof.
02:20:44.940 - 02:20:47.724, Speaker B: This is awesome. Great submission. Thank you.
02:20:47.922 - 02:21:31.110, Speaker A: Thanks. It was really neat. I'm actually curious why it's being specified that it has to be bots taking the order. Would there be any value you think into just exposing like a UI or something for an order book for normal humans? Absolutely, it's just that because for that demonstration I was approving it with a UI so that the actual fill order was done with UI. I just would say it would be quite difficult to manage it, but if there would be an interest for it and a demand for it. Yeah, absolutely. Really cool.
02:21:31.110 - 02:22:22.740, Speaker A: And besides what was said would be cool to actually extend this to the Ave collateral swap functionality. If E three is something, swap it to something else, the stable event and maybe close partially your loan position. If collateral gets into certain position like increase or decrease, that can be pretty interesting. I don't know if you have seen like Ave has this collateral swap and that deposit swap and closing your loan with the collateral where you can actually play with this feature. I think this is quite interesting because you could actually put the orders wherever you want in aggregator way. That's pretty cool. Yeah.
02:22:22.740 - 02:22:37.690, Speaker A: Is this your second hackathon? Right? I think 2nd second, yeah. I did Space DX last which was the game. Pretty cool. And that was amazing. And that was first time you tried Ethereum. Cool. Yeah.
02:22:37.690 - 02:22:57.776, Speaker A: That's amazing. So this was like the big D five plunge. So it's quite intimidating. At first I was like what am I going to come up with? So I had no idea. But yeah, it was good. It started off with the limit ordering thing and then I kind of realized that I could actually make interest on limit orders, which yeah, that was pretty cool. That was pretty cool.
02:22:57.776 - 02:23:56.004, Speaker A: I forgot to mention actually they're generating interest there. Yeah, that was just like because if you have the static funds, the problem with the current limit ordering systems that I've seen, they're all hybrid, so it's like you have on chain settlements but off chain orders. So KyberSwap, for an example, they have a bot that runs themselves. So if you open up to having anyone's bot, you're actually increasing the decentralized nature of the actual limit ordering system because they have a centralized point of weakness there. So it's by incentivizing the bots, more bots will come, there will be better kind of competition and so orders should always be filled. Hopefully. I guess that puts us at time.
02:23:56.004 - 02:24:22.280, Speaker A: I don't know if there's any final questions, but if not, thanks a lot, James. Awesome hack. Cheers guys, and thank you very much for judging us all. And that brings us to the end. Thank you so much to the judges, Min, Alex and Stani. Thank you so much. There's a couple more sessions tonight and tomorrow of judging and then closing ceremonies later this week, Thursday.
02:24:23.580 - 02:24:25.928, Speaker B: Thank you. Andrew, awesome as always.
02:24:26.094 - 02:24:48.070, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. Awesome. Yeah, awesome. I'll hit you on the chat, Raymond. Just stick around in the discord.
02:24:48.070 - 02:24:58.786, Speaker A: Okay, sounds good. Wait, also tomorrow we'll be joining at twelve. Yeah. Okay, cool, awesome. That's fine. Sounds good. Thanks, Ray.
02:24:58.786 - 02:24:59.460, Speaker A: No problem.
