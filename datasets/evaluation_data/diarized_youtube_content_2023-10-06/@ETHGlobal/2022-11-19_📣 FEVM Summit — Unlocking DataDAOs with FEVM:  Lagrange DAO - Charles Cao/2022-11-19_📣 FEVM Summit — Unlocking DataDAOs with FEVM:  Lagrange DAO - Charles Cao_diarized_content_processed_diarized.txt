00:00:06.490 - 00:00:19.520, Speaker A: So Charles is working on another data dao side which is the LaGrange dao. So Charles, when you're ready, feel free to yeah, welcome to the stage and yeah, feel free to jump into your presentation when you have a second.
00:00:20.450 - 00:00:21.726, Speaker B: Yeah, great.
00:00:21.908 - 00:00:22.350, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:22.420 - 00:00:24.670, Speaker B: So, 1 minute.
00:00:33.390 - 00:00:33.850, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:33.920 - 00:01:44.154, Speaker B: So I'm darf so I'm founder of First One. So we have been working on the Frycoin storage and development ecosystem for quite a while and I felt exciting recently because we have found new opportunities and start a new journey to working towards the lahounge dow for the data sharing and Analystic space for decentralized scientists. Basically we see that there was lots of interesting scientific data in the world. They need really better services. So there's a lot of lots of good public data sets. People want a world of sitewide access, they want a lower cost computing power, they want to have contribution and a social impact because when they do the data uploading they want people know that they actually do something good for the society. And also there was a lot of things on the data but it's not really on chain.
00:01:44.154 - 00:02:46.558, Speaker B: So it means that sometimes link loss, the space loss, work loss which is really important for those precious data and versioning. Now basically the version is all based on the centralized system and there was also like sharing the data is based on Google cloud or AWS cloud. This is really a huge market. From the graph you see there will be more than 250 petabyte storage after a few years. That means that it will be covered 10% or even to 50% of Fryco storage which really means a lot where Frico has over 18GB of storage. On the other side, the different scientific data they're still hosting on some central storage places looking for storage space. So we really want to build a place for decentralized science without the borders.
00:02:46.558 - 00:03:46.860, Speaker B: There are a couple of different places people need storage and need decent incentives. So we see like enterprise have their data stay in the hard drive. We see like storage provider working hard on better storage proven technology, we see like developers working hard on the retrievals and the token holders, they have a five point token in hand. They really want to encourage the ecosystem but they don't really know how to do that. So we need better places to add different people in the same cycle so they can contribute to the bigger system. With the FBM found that there's a better opportunity to get everybody together. So first of all, there was lots of data sets you can convert in the data set, become data schema stored on IPFS and also on the firecode network.
00:03:46.860 - 00:05:08.520, Speaker B: Previously without FBM we can only do one and a half a year which is 18 months storage. But now it's possible to make an extendable long term contract to satisfy the needs of storage for long term. For example, 75 data in university. Maybe they need more than five years ten years storage so it will be really good opportunity for them to store on Fryco now compared to what happened in the past few years. On the workspace side we can create a place for people to sharing their data and models and on the payment side the K proof can be aggregated on the FVM to reduce the gas cost and increase the volume of transactions. Cross chain payment with FVM integration give you more possibilities to make a payment not just in Faricoin but other blockchain users like polygon and banners chains also make a payment using the cross chain defry bridges to enable the storage on firecoin network. We have already done some work on that but now it's become more easy under the modeling and the computing kind of working together as well.
00:05:08.520 - 00:06:30.448, Speaker B: We already noticed that there are lots of computing power existing in the Frac network for ceiling storage, but not 100% dedicated ceiling after the storage is onboarded. They can also share some of the computing power for the cross chain computing. And if we can create a work space, put the data set and the model together, and add a powerprice in the same places, it can contribute. There was a token economics we needed to be done to sharing the revenue from data provider, storage provider, data consumer and computing consumers. Then we need an effort on the data onboarding and allocated the dedicated funds for people willing to provide a storage and willing to use the data. This is the technical part of the stack. So in order to make a very strong system we needed to using the smart contract at the core services to make the payment where you upload the data to the fragrance network you need different people to swap the tokens.
00:06:30.448 - 00:07:39.420, Speaker B: So the external ecosystem they can using smart contract based on DeFi cross chain to using the same storage services. At the end you need to give people the capability to mint their data asset as NFT. It will be great if it's a one click experience instead of writing a whole bunch of code and at the end all the resources in the fragment network can be contributed to different system. The critical part is about data governance under the computing validation. So we need a data oracle to help proving the data on chain data availability and also the data computing capability. So this part is by a Dow organization. You need a multi SIG wallet to sign the proof on chain so we have done some work on top of that under the help of Channing external adapter and also Frycoin native Feb.
00:07:41.600 - 00:07:41.916, Speaker C: This.
00:07:41.938 - 00:09:02.720, Speaker B: Is the data and payment flow. So we found that in the new Dow model there are actually new business opportunities for existing Far plus system. There was a couple of things like the data provider so the data set owner and the model creator they are those data provider with the Frycom plus project they become five plus deal which will be ten times more power than CC sectors. The storage provider willing to store them for free even they're willing to give them some revenue sharing and then generate some confusing why storage provider sometimes willing to pay for stored kind data. This seems like a very not common in traditional business. This is because when storage provider started using the data to earn extra fire coins, it becomes a data consumer in business side. Actually data consumer is paid for everything he needs to pay for the storage, he needs to pay for the computing and he needs to pay for the binaries.
00:09:02.720 - 00:09:44.052, Speaker B: So when storage provider trying to get the fireplace data for storage he is downloading data from the data provider. That's why he needed to share the revenue to the data provider. It is for the data. Downloading data is a value, that is how it works for today but there's no clear way and a clear market about how we can do this process automatically under in smart contract way. And this is a data schema. So this is a data schema and the model storage. So we'll have a bigger data set.
00:09:44.052 - 00:11:25.140, Speaker B: For example more than 400 terabytes it will become chunked to 32 gigabyte data pieces. The index data should store in a safe place as a data schema and this schema can be stored on IPFS because people need the index to easily fetch it of the data relationships. At the end of the day, those data include the data schema needed to backup to firecoin. It should be backup up to five nodes or even more to provide enough redundancy and availability. The data space is also on firecoin because it's a huge amount of size and you can trading the data set minted as an NFT on the data market to show that you are actually a data owner of it and you want to provide opportunity for others mix the funds together. This is one example from the community who using the same methodology to mint the Frycoin snapshot as a data set. So basically like the backup frequently backup the frycoin snapshot put it storage on fryco network and create a CSV format JSN format data set schema and they mint the schema as the NFT with the smart contract and put it on OpenSea so everybody can fetch the data set schema from the smart contract.
00:11:25.140 - 00:11:38.584, Speaker B: And because this is really important, so it will be the key pointer in the smart contract with the IPFS. Hash, you get the data. Safely persistent in the network for long.
00:11:38.622 - 00:11:39.240, Speaker C: Term.
00:11:42.860 - 00:12:45.500, Speaker B: And in order to make the computing become maltim easy, we needed to create a space which can join the data provider and the model provider together with the computing power and at the end the communicator will become a computing result. Back up to Fracture Network. We have done lots of work in the past few years and we have web three switch to worldwide searching all the available storage provider and give them retipation points. So we know that who is good for the community to store, who is reliable. We have a cross chain storage previously already working with the polygon network and we are planning to migrate to Fev EVM Frycoin network. It's really solidly compatible, it can automatically backup story to five nodes on Firecoin ecosystem. We also have eight computing nodes doing the computing based on the APFS container hash.
00:12:45.500 - 00:13:37.384, Speaker B: So now we have course for participants to join the ecosystem doing the revenue sharing. So we are estimated about twelve to 10% revenue were shared with all the data set uploaders. We have been contributors in the system for a long time since 2020 and we participated in the Snitchhot one sensor B two and Fry Austin. We managed the data dow hackathon. You can see we already have lots of ecosystems projects working on the data and related building work. Now we are going to show some work we have been done already. So this is the system we personally using as a V one draft version.
00:13:37.384 - 00:15:05.480, Speaker B: So we already be able to connect with the Firepoint valid system and you can log in with the MetaMask to sign in and you will see your wallet address and your balance of the frypoint and you can create your data set here according to your need. If you want to create a new one, you can just add the data set. You have your wallet as the owner you can give the name about data set for example global and for the data schema you can choose the data schema for example I have a data schema here already. You can put the data side here so in the future we can fetch it. You see here you create a new data visa content here. We're still working on the model and the space and the computing. We managed to get the computing work here from the TensorFlow running all everything and doing all the computing works here and get the result from all the systems.
00:15:05.480 - 00:15:29.570, Speaker B: So the next step of the work is really like to make every pieces working together to computing hashi, machine learning, FFS integration and create the working space for everybody. And the token sharing model.
00:15:31.540 - 00:15:32.320, Speaker C: With this.
00:15:32.390 - 00:16:20.050, Speaker B: Margin storage we are working on provide people a feeling of 30 gabe bytes of free storage. So with those storage can be connected with the data dow. You can use this as AWS compatible filling storage and the storage data used to on the datadale will be backup to IPFS and then back on five nodes and those storage providers will share their revenue with you. And as a data provider you get income because your data value when data model start and the computing power starts you again extra value from your machine learning models. Yeah, so that's pretty much about what we are now and.
00:16:21.860 - 00:16:22.592, Speaker C: We are working.
00:16:22.646 - 00:16:35.360, Speaker B: Toward the next milestone to bring the computing power online. And please follow our Twitter and if you have any questions, you're also welcome to talk to me on Telegram.
00:16:35.520 - 00:16:37.480, Speaker C: Thank you. Awesome.
00:16:37.550 - 00:17:30.600, Speaker A: Thank you Charles for the presentation and also for those demos at the end on what's actually being built. I think really awesome to see just this concept of being able to take just kind of underlying infrastructure and actually make it really easy for end users to store files or then eventually do compute and these things seems like really valuable effort that's being put into this. So thank you for that. Just see if there's any questions from the chat. But it doesn't seem like any have come in through so far. So maybe just curious on your end, like if you were you yourself, you say you've been in the community for a long time and I saw a lot of the hackathons and stuff there. If you were going to be building this weekend at this hackathon, what would you be thinking about and what are some of the projects that come to mind that you'd like to see built this weekend?
00:17:31.420 - 00:18:32.508, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm really interested about the project. He make a usage of the data. For example, we see in last datadog hackathons we see people like using the data for the decentralized routing because the CDN network building on top of the data they're trying to share. Using the revenue sharing from the data storage and redistributed to other services become a cycle. We're also interesting to see people how to do in the governance part, for example, votings, sharing, openings, proposals, submissions. And the third part is something like we really like to see people can using Firecoin provide value for access like Miro. We know that Mirror is already using the IPFS and the Firecoin storage, but how can make them use more and eventually pay more in the future.
00:18:32.508 - 00:18:35.150, Speaker B: So that will be a very interesting topic for us.
00:18:36.240 - 00:18:36.990, Speaker C: Amazing.
00:18:38.080 - 00:18:38.588, Speaker B: Cool.
00:18:38.674 - 00:19:00.128, Speaker A: It totally makes sense. Okay, great. I didn't see okay, cool. Somebody asked is there really a connection in between IPFS and NFTs? I guess it might be worth kind of dipping in a little bit closer into how you can kind of use IPFS to be that storage layer behind NFTs.
00:19:00.304 - 00:19:14.356, Speaker B: Yeah, actually we see like NFT stored on IPFS is valuable, but the only issue is like lots of NFTs have IPFS content hashi but they don't really tie together and where is the stored?
00:19:14.388 - 00:19:14.584, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:14.622 - 00:19:40.048, Speaker B: That's just one IPFS. How about the IPFS Content? We know that IPFS is not incentive to store for a long time yet. So have IPFS storage backup on Friday coin and building the relationship bundling together then user feel safe like yes, my storage is on IPFS and NFT. So permanent storage, that is how it works.
00:19:40.134 - 00:19:40.770, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:41.700 - 00:20:09.908, Speaker A: Right, yeah, exactly the kind of NFTs right now a lot of them have the content hashes. But of course if somebody stops serving that file or the network stops serving that or whatever, even gateway, a lot of people use gateway instead which is even more fragile then your NFT, at least the content behind it goes away. But then yeah, actually having that defined relationship between filecoin and IPFS and kind of having that guarantee that perpetual storage.
00:20:10.084 - 00:20:28.620, Speaker B: Is sort of the fubm, we don't really rely on other block cross chain solutions. We can have F, UVM native solutions, smart contract, get everything in one system, which means makes sense ultimately much easier than the cross chain solutions.
00:20:29.200 - 00:20:30.990, Speaker C: Definitely. Very cool.
00:20:31.440 - 00:20:31.948, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:20:32.034 - 00:20:48.770, Speaker A: Okay, well that's all the time we have on our end. Charles, thank you so much for your time and your presentation on the LaGrange Dao and looking forward to having you back on the show at some point. And also feel free to join the discord and chat with people as they build over the weekend. Yeah, thanks for being thank you.
