00:00:07.370 - 00:00:48.730, Speaker A: And with that, I want to welcome all of you again. And let's bring on our very first interview for today. Our first speaker is aya Miyaguchi. Aya is the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation. Ethereum foundation is the organization that currently pioneers a lot of the developer ecosystem, some activity from the core development side of the Ethereum protocol, and a lot more things that we're going to discuss about what the EF does and what they would like to do moving forward. We're going to talk about all the things that is on aya's mind, the opportunity in Japan and everything in between. So, without further ado, please welcome our first talk of today Aya to the stage.
00:00:48.730 - 00:00:58.202, Speaker A: Nice hat.
00:00:58.346 - 00:01:00.720, Speaker B: Thank you. Hello everyone.
00:01:03.970 - 00:01:14.626, Speaker A: It's been four years since we had an official Ethereum event in Japan back in Defcon, Osaka. I think it's four. Three and a half. Four. I forget if I count COVID or not.
00:01:14.648 - 00:01:15.342, Speaker B: 2019.
00:01:15.406 - 00:01:25.240, Speaker A: 2019. Yeah, almost four. How does it feel to be back in Japan? And what are some of the things that you've noticed about this ecosystem in the last four years?
00:01:26.890 - 00:02:23.514, Speaker B: Yeah, so Japan, I have this weird relationship with Japan. I am from here, but I left the country a while ago, I think 16 years ago. But yeah, whenever I guess when I'm outside of Japan, I feel very Japanese. But when I'm back to Japan, I feel very not Japanese. But anyway so I was very excited about DevCon back then, like happening in where I was from. It was an exciting gathering and a lot of developers came from many different places. But I think Japan regarding I think the crypto or blockchain industry has been always here.
00:02:23.514 - 00:03:04.214, Speaker B: But when it comes to especially because this Ethereum community and focusing on building side, that wasn't happening as much, I guess it's not just in Japan, because the protocol itself wasn't really as ready as now. Today it's even more ready. But I come here sometimes, right? And then I started to recognize some this like a new momentum or an.
00:03:04.252 - 00:03:13.546, Speaker A: Interest in so you notice the excitement in people. Do you notice students or companies or what are some obvious things that feel.
00:03:13.728 - 00:03:59.740, Speaker B: Yeah, well, obviously just similar to in any other countries or especially in Asia, the biggest interest used to be on trading and then a cryptocurrency side, but not really much about what you can build. And what are the things that are already being built? So that side of like, okay, developer community was there, but it wasn't as visible. And now I see a lot of talents are happening here. And then more developers are coming into even the protocol layer side from Japan, which is very exciting. And also yeah, businesses are interested.
00:04:01.790 - 00:04:49.190, Speaker A: I absolutely agree. Because we do online events also, in addition to in person hackathons, we get to see what people are applying for, for the online events. And when we looked at the numbers for where we were seeing the most growth in new people. Japan was number three on our list, and it was just obvious to us that we had to be here for our first in person event. And it's so interesting because we have had the same information for the last few years, and we do see the trend on more trading and more finance and currency related use cases. But now people are excited about Dows NFTs payments as a means to solve different problems instead of trading. And you notice that immediately, too, when we saw all the applications, what people were building, it was very refreshing.
00:04:49.190 - 00:05:23.250, Speaker A: And I get excited about what the opportunity looks like, because anytime you see a new country come into this space, you get to see what they care about. And Japan has the most interesting problems that they're excited about that are different than what the US. Thinks or what Europe thinks. And to me, that's what I get super excited for. You used to be a teacher here. How has being a teacher influenced how you think about being a director at Ethereum Foundation?
00:05:25.450 - 00:06:24.582, Speaker B: Yeah, well, when I left the teaching job, I didn't really think about, okay, I go to this blockchain space, which didn't even exist, really. But in a way, it's funny. I was just having conversation with some of the core devs on the way here to celebrate Chaper to imprison, which never happened, which is great. And then we just started talking about my history here. But yeah, I used to be a teacher and I used to be a high school teacher. And I was passionate about talking about kind of like letting students have critical thinking minds and then problems in the world. And that's kind of the core thing of how this technology was started.
00:06:24.582 - 00:06:50.798, Speaker B: Right. So it is, in a way, in my mind, it is related. And also, I left the job because I didn't really like teachers don't really explore the word. And then you just graduate from college and then you are called sensei here. Right. And then I just didn't like that title. I didn't feel like I earned possibly approving yet.
00:06:50.798 - 00:07:36.080, Speaker B: Yeah, and then also I was encouraging my students to go outside of the world and then, see, this is still tiny country. And then mostly just Japanese. But I didn't really much. But I just had an opportunity to back when I was in San Francisco, my focus in my graduate was sustainable business, financial inclusion. And then that's when I met that was Bitcoin. Back then, Ethereum wasn't there. And then after Ethereum was born, the potential with the technology became more than 100 x.
00:07:37.970 - 00:07:43.710, Speaker A: We'll dig into all of that. Let's zoom out a little bit. What does the EF do?
00:07:43.860 - 00:08:28.490, Speaker B: Oh, yes. And then I didn't talk about what my teaching rate, but maybe I can start with the Ethereum Foundation supports the Ethereum Ecosystem. And the important part is we don't own Ethereum, which I need to say because it's more confusing. There are many blockchains now, are mostly run by a company. And then also the project of Ethereum is really meaning building the platform protocol. Even like today, you saw the hard fork happen. That work is done by communities like community members and contributors.
00:08:28.490 - 00:09:41.266, Speaker B: So we stay as a coordinator. There are some research and developers who belong to the UEF, but they also do a lot of coordination work among researchers, among developers. So the EF does that work. But also, since we support the ecosystem, we give grants and that's like financial support to of course the work of protocol layer that doesn't have business model but also educational work, community development, work events. We see that also as educational work like your hackathons. But then it's not just financial support is part of it, but what we care is really how we maintain the values and vision of ECM, which I often describe as infinite garden.
00:09:41.458 - 00:09:43.314, Speaker A: Tell us more about the infinite garden.
00:09:43.442 - 00:10:18.258, Speaker B: Yeah, so the infinite garden idea is like infinite. The word infinite was inspired by the book finite and infinite game by James Cars. A finite game, normally like regular games are played for someone to win. So when someone wins, the game ends. But an infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing the game. So I thought that is actually already in the special part of the Ethereum community. Hey, we all work together.
00:10:18.258 - 00:10:31.026, Speaker B: We often don't really care about who is winning. It's more like how do we get this hard work, a hard fork, get to the goal altogether?
00:10:31.138 - 00:10:32.354, Speaker A: Mass coordination at skill.
00:10:32.402 - 00:11:13.330, Speaker B: Yeah, mass coordination. And there are many multiple crime teams which are kind of like supported by businesses. Some of them are supported by businesses, but they all work together. It's not like one of them compete wins within this game. And the garden is really this ecosystem wasn't really designed with roadmap of the ecosystem like with the organic group. Also, a lot of things in the Ethereum ecosystem luckily happen organically without us doing anything. So that's the beauty of it.
00:11:13.330 - 00:11:47.280, Speaker B: So if we don't really have to do anything, that's great. If something is happening organically without earth support and also in a healthy way, that's the best scenario. So why don't we celebrate that? So that's where when we identify some key players who are value aligned like ETH gobal and then, okay, we don't really have to run hackathons at VF, there's someone who does it very well and also making sure values are there. So that's our work.
00:11:52.290 - 00:12:30.638, Speaker A: There's two threads here. So one is it's not like a company which everybody's used to. I mean, the second we go into a foundation or Dow model, we don't even have good frameworks to map this to. And you kind of shared some of the things that you do. If the EF doesn't own Ethereum or doesn't have kind of similar behave like a company. There's definitely some positives and negatives of this. What gets harder in this model? And what do you kind of feel like you get to improve or you want to improve but it's not easy because coordination now adds a lot more complexity or time.
00:12:30.638 - 00:12:34.350, Speaker A: And how do you think about those types of problems in common cases?
00:12:37.090 - 00:14:01.900, Speaker B: I think the biggest challenge is well, there are many challenges. This is not just for EF, for Ethereum. It's because we play infinite games that as a whole ecosystem, for example, the work of hard fork doesn't go as quick as one company running everything. There's one CTO and then you can just show the roadmap and then control everything. So sometimes the understanding that there is lack of understanding of how this works even for the merge last year, which because you said there are more beginners here, the Ethereum shifted, the consensus mechanism shifted from proof of work which was rely on mining to secure the network to proof of stake. So now that reduced more than 99% of energy consumption. But that work was everyone wanted that to happen sooner than the work took longer.
00:14:01.900 - 00:14:44.694, Speaker B: And then at the same time, because network was getting bigger the more people are using it, more people are building things on an application, it's running already. So the bigger it gets, you have to make sure the level of security you have to make sure to do that in a decentralized way without one company controlling it. I didn't do it, I just watched and then I supported. But such a dawning work and that is kind of hard for regular company people to understand because it's completely different how things work at a company.
00:14:44.892 - 00:15:20.366, Speaker A: So maybe one thing I think will be helpful for the audience to understand is this well, this is by design not this doesn't happen and now we're dealing with it. This is how you wanted it to happen and that's what the challenges are because these are the trade offs. Why do you think that's the way to go? Why not just have everybody in the same office and just get things done and offer everybody the best and quickest service for what they want instead of having everybody try their approach and coordinating it? How should somebody think about these trade offs?
00:15:20.558 - 00:16:28.860, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe a lot of people in Ethereum have different way to answer this, but to me personally, Ethereum doesn't really compromise decentralization and that's like you see that in the technology but also the technical decisions are tied to the values, right? And then we do care about decentralization is one of the most important values that everyone in Ethereum cares. So if you really try to build decentralized system in a centralized way you see a lot of different parts that it kind of start to network. So that's why I can't really emphasize enough how much I just realized recently because I talked to in Tokyo. I talked to non Ethereum people or some government. It's I just realized that I'm in a weird group.
00:16:29.230 - 00:16:31.580, Speaker A: It's either you're crazy or they're crazy.
00:16:32.110 - 00:17:03.170, Speaker B: So it's like something is very normal for us, is not normal for other people. But our people are very opinionated about decentralization. To the point even. I am the executive director of Ethereum Foundation. But I'm not a regular management boss position. Whether I want it or not. I do want it this way, luckily.
00:17:03.170 - 00:17:11.958, Speaker B: But that's actually what's helpful for me, being used to be a teacher. Because it's kind of a similar like, okay, we let others you could deal.
00:17:11.964 - 00:17:13.350, Speaker A: With a lot of teenagers.
00:17:14.810 - 00:17:20.170, Speaker B: That's true. We have a lot of diverse blames.
00:17:20.830 - 00:17:21.674, Speaker A: That's a good thing.
00:17:21.712 - 00:17:51.620, Speaker B: Neurodiversity. But also yeah, every way, it's not just technology. It is like how decisions are made and people are very careful about I guess that comes from some people really care about we believe we're part of something that can make systemic changes in the world.
00:17:53.270 - 00:18:10.698, Speaker A: Culture defines all of these things. And if you're not willing to compromise on decentralization or the values or the opportunity seems like that's the only outcome that you get for how you can do this without changing the original goal. And that's a very interesting way of putting that.
00:18:10.784 - 00:18:39.230, Speaker B: So I think if we don't do it this way, it becomes like a product. Right? And then once it's a product, it's by a company. And I think Ethereum is way bigger than that. And then I think people it's not just my decision. People know this. And that's why we have to be patient. But sometimes the word is not patient.
00:18:39.230 - 00:18:54.486, Speaker B: Sometimes the more newer people we have so the education is important. Explaining things like events is important. But yeah, I think this is an.
00:18:54.508 - 00:19:39.330, Speaker A: Interesting thing that you just said a couple of minutes ago. So most of us are engineers that are part of the ETH Global events or the hackathons. They understand what's happening or they want to understand what's happening. And even they sometimes struggle to understand some of these concepts. Like, what do you mean? This is owned by nobody or a piece of code, or this is not a company, or this is a dow that controls other companies that are dows or all these things which are just brand new concepts. And not only that, it also maps differently to different cultures and countries and people of different industries. What has been some interesting observations you made about telling everybody how the space works in oh, in Japan.
00:19:39.330 - 00:19:39.970, Speaker A: In Japan.
00:19:40.050 - 00:19:40.920, Speaker B: Got it.
00:19:44.250 - 00:19:47.670, Speaker A: What are people weirded out by the most? Or what is the hardest thing you have to explain?
00:19:47.740 - 00:20:40.346, Speaker B: And I see I think it's yeah, in Japan, a lot of good developers belong to enterprises and big companies. So there is less of this developer community like freelancers or even the culture of open source is not a culture, but it's kind of culturally. It's also like being open, doing things openly. That's not really common here. So that different type of education. Like I needed to explain actually, the mindset shift is also important. More than just understanding technology.
00:20:40.346 - 00:21:25.080, Speaker B: Like people tend to think of japanese people are very diligent about, okay, they have solidi workshops or let's learn about the Merge workshop. But the cultural side of saying, how do we learn? Like tomorrow at Hackathon, I'm going to talk about this open learning culture in the museum, but how developers in the museum learn from each other or even anyone can actually build tools for others to learn or that type of thing. It's very not just here, but it's not easy for Japanese to understand.
00:21:26.250 - 00:21:32.282, Speaker A: What is the best way of thinking about helping them get more comfortable or understand or be part of the same.
00:21:32.336 - 00:21:41.246, Speaker B: Culture, I think, well, that's one of the reason why I'm excited about the Hackathons happening tomorrow is we'll put them.
00:21:41.268 - 00:21:46.270, Speaker A: In a centralized building and then have them see this for two days. They can't leave.
00:21:46.340 - 00:22:21.900, Speaker B: Alcoholic is running around, some drama is happening. But yeah, they get to see the vibe, but also they get to see how others are learning from each other and then okay, it's just that Japanese are very humble. Maybe I'm like some people might say I'm Japanese, but they never say I'm good at something. Right. So they tend to be too humble and they don't even think they can share their.
00:22:24.350 - 00:22:25.530, Speaker A: Perfectionism.
00:22:26.030 - 00:22:59.862, Speaker B: Yeah, perfectionism really is something blocking from them to learn English, first of all. But also the beauty of ethereum is it's permissionless, meaning how you participate. Anyone can participate if you want to, right. At any layer. And then you can write your ideas. ETH research pays. But then even that, I think people are very intimidated to do that.
00:22:59.862 - 00:23:04.038, Speaker B: Unless okay, is this a perfect idea to share?
00:23:04.124 - 00:23:39.460, Speaker A: We're already seeing some of that for this weekend. So we kind of talked about developers. How do we make this easier as a country? As you're talking to regulators, they're thinking about new policies. Right now, crypto is just getting considered more seriously about how do we make it easy for more companies to start, more people to come in. What do you think from all of your learnings, from your previous work at Kraken to what you've seen about regulation and policies around the world, how can Japan learn from all those things and make it a lot easier for the people here?
00:23:40.310 - 00:25:05.358, Speaker B: Yeah, so Japan did a lot of things. As I was more involved in the regulatory side of conversation for my previous work, I had to. But the people from the government I often had interaction with from the regulator side, meaning like financial regulators or that type of discussion. And that was necessary back then. But now it's not just about making sure bad things for bad things not to happen, but it's about making sure good things to happen, for good things to happen and how can we do that or how can government support that? I think it's again, like mind shift, but there are regulators roles. Their role is to make sure for bad things not to happen. But there are other parts of the government, I think, trying to like, that this is a new momentum I'm seeing, is like they're trying to catch up with what they have were not like catch up with the thing that maybe they haven't learned enough before.
00:25:05.358 - 00:26:35.910, Speaker B: And then also I do want to encourage not just government people, but there are any more experts in Japan, including maybe web two companies or web two experts, how do they embrace this? Again, there needs to be some mind Shift like, okay, how do we support individual developers for them to stay individual, still contribute to different things like open source. I mean, of course application layer, developers for application layer can happen as a startup or as part of big business or enterprises. But I guess that they need to figure out how to embrace the diversity even in the developer community. And I do want to encourage that how they but I think the status of developers here, there are a lot of talented developers, but it's not embraced enough, like acknowledged enough. So it's still like, okay, a company at a company, normally if it's a big company, management make the decisions and then they trickles down. They tell developers what to build. But the ethereum way is that you need to include these developers in the idea generation.
00:26:35.910 - 00:26:52.640, Speaker B: Blame Storming Stage because that's very important to really even come up with the idea. So that change needs to be embraced at different layers at the company level, but also at the government level. They need to understand that.
00:26:53.490 - 00:27:05.810, Speaker A: Do you think there's hope? You feel optimistic about good policies being set up or do we need to do a lot more work or we just got to tell them to also see the hackathon tomorrow? What's the best way to let them make great decisions?
00:27:07.350 - 00:28:22.080, Speaker B: I wasn't optimistic usually before, but I am optimistic now. That's really good to hear from some conversations. That's why I think this event tackathon starting tomorrow is happening at the perfect timing to boost that momentum that's here. And I really also personally hope Japan can be a good example of one thing Japan is very good at that they never say they're good at anything, but they're good at teamwork. So they are good at teamwork so they know, actually know how to work as a team. They just need to open that to more different styles of openness, not just within the company, not just within the government. Like, can you create a teamwork with more open community, open society? And that's something I think the ethereum community can teach or can inspire show by example.
00:28:22.080 - 00:28:29.920, Speaker B: Yeah. So the hope that happens at Hackathons and also a lot of different things happening this week.
00:28:31.730 - 00:29:08.774, Speaker A: I personally resonate with this. One of the reasons we started ETH Global was when you looked up anything about crypto, all you would see was the negative news. And if you were in this space, you could tell that that's not true or the weight of what they're emphasizing is way less significant than all the good stuff that's happening. And we wanted to just make sure that anytime something happens in this space, we also equally, if not more, cover the good things and not have that overshadow the bad things. And that is very helpful in policy. That's very helpful in getting people excited. That's very helpful.
00:29:08.774 - 00:30:02.160, Speaker A: When people are thinking about changing careers and getting into this space, they want to see potential. And we hope that some of these conversations you've had, some of the real life things that will come out this weekend from people, they'll get to see all the good and make better decisions. One interesting thing that you talked about on how culture in Japan works for companies is that it's a very top down approach, whereas what we've seen firsthand in this space is more bottoms up. And individuals have sometimes very strong opinions or sometimes they want to just make sure they're working with everybody to make a collective good decision. You effectively are describing coordination. You talked about your goal for the EF is to be a bigger coordination layer. What does that actually mean in practice? What is a time horizon? What are you doing now that you don't want to do in the future? Or what are you not doing now that you want to do in future? What does the next five years of EF look like?
00:30:04.530 - 00:31:43.590, Speaker B: Yeah, so like I said, currently the coordination type of coordination we're doing is really we figure out who to empower, who needs more empowerment, and then we also want to make sure that we empower the right ones. And the reason why we do care is not just specifically about whether that team or that project we support succeeds or not, but EF still does carry part of the legitimacy of Ethereum or even blockchain space. And then by empowering someone, we give piece of legitimacy to that team. We hope that project or the team to be a good example again to show how we work together in this how we play infinite games in this ecosystem. And then I think it's like originally the Ethernet Foundation used to be the hub of the place to house developers and researchers who are building the protocol of Ethereum. And yeah, was the only place. But then, like, gladiatory and then it's just because it is an open source project, anyone can participate.
00:31:43.590 - 00:32:43.394, Speaker B: gladiatory that the participants and contributors to the protocol work increased. When I joined, it was already that the contributors were way bigger than EF. And I thought, someone needs to support that like other contributors. And then we added that supporting role and then coordination role, and then gradually they think naturally we stay as a coordinator. So when I show that the other day, I showed my poor hand growing picture of like there are trees and plants in the garden and those plants and trees are the one we support, but we want to make sure is they get water and sunshine. That's more obvious like a financial support.
00:32:43.432 - 00:32:44.382, Speaker A: It's a great analogy.
00:32:44.446 - 00:33:47.814, Speaker B: Yeah. But then actually the loose of each plants and trees, whether they carry the values, you don't even see that from outside. So we do this kind of like in the soil, whether there's good nutrition or bad nutritions, because that can be replaced. That work is becoming more important. It's going to be the most important thing for us. I believe that's my, again, like EF we discuss with everyone, or don't really try not to force my idea, but that's how I see it's increasingly, or it will all be the most important thing for us to do. And the reason why is that is because everything else is happening nicely already, and even the one that give sunshine and water meaning financial support is not only EF anymore, which is great, and we embrace that.
00:33:47.814 - 00:33:50.722, Speaker B: We would love for others to participate.
00:33:50.786 - 00:33:55.778, Speaker A: As it's a good sign of an ecosystem too. It shows growth, it shows potential and excitement.
00:33:55.874 - 00:34:53.100, Speaker B: Yeah. So there are other funding mechanism happening in the ecosystem and then that is going to increase. So that's why in the future we keep staying as a coordination. And maybe at some point that it's not like coordination, the level of coordination that's needed and then that's needed to be done by us will decrease. And another way of explaining is often it's how the easiest way to describe how ethereum is different and how the vision of EF is, is that we hold less than 1% of entire ether. Right. 00:28 or less.
00:34:53.100 - 00:35:26.594, Speaker B: And percent of all the supply. Yeah, all the supply. And then the value of asset in the fiat value, which I think Balaji is going to talk today, it changes, it's increasing now. But the important part is that ratio goes down. And that shows how we are committed.
00:35:26.642 - 00:35:28.914, Speaker A: For us to grow the ecosystem.
00:35:28.962 - 00:35:45.180, Speaker B: To grow the ecosystem. And it doesn't mean something that's there will decrease, it's more like it will be distributed. But then we want to make sure if you okay, you guys, Kelly a little bit up.
00:35:47.550 - 00:35:48.700, Speaker A: That'Ll be nice.
00:35:50.590 - 00:36:05.010, Speaker B: Make sure that okay. You just didn't only receive ether or didn't only receive that you are carrying the values, you are carrying the legitimacy. So you are also responsible.
00:36:06.070 - 00:36:15.960, Speaker A: You're effectively creating mass scale shareholders that care about the same thing and aligned. Yeah, it's a really big company.
00:36:16.330 - 00:36:30.220, Speaker B: Yeah, well, yeah, I don't know if it's a weekend ether holder as a shareholder in the same way as a public company but it is the pot that it's different.
00:36:31.390 - 00:36:36.614, Speaker A: Everybody opts in to care about the same values and that's how you grow this garden.
00:36:36.742 - 00:36:37.370, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:37.520 - 00:37:11.190, Speaker A: We're nearing at the end. If anybody has any questions, please come over here to the mic. We have a couple of minutes for a few questions. So if we have any, we'll just do that. Otherwise we'll try to wrap this up in a couple of minutes. One interesting piece that at least I took away from what you just said is I don't think we've seen this done before. So not only are you going to be one of the first people to actually try this but you're going to be doing this thing at a massive scale.
00:37:11.190 - 00:37:34.880, Speaker A: Ethereum is now a huge project especially with after the merge there's thousands of people involved and even for the future of EF, as you think about becoming a better coordinator there is going to be pieces that you have to figure out in real time. How do you think about doing that and how do you think about not making mistakes or making mistakes and learning from them?
00:37:35.330 - 00:38:40.434, Speaker B: Yeah. So one of our guiding principles and we often use is subtraction and that can be also misunderstood is that it sounds like we do less. Right. And actually the amount of work we have to do by making sure we distribute the power but at the same time making sure values are there. So actually there are a whole lot of I call it ninja work under the ground that we have to do like really talking to different teams and then asking the right questions. So I have some EF people around there but they do a lot of hard work and it's actually more than it will be a lot easier saying okay, I'm the ed here's the COO and everyone reports to do this this way but we can do it that way. So it's a lot of more work to do.
00:38:40.434 - 00:39:54.362, Speaker B: And then also subtraction is all about seeking the right balance. So if someone has it's not just like cannot be done by manual like if we look at some part of infrastructure or public goods or the entire ecosystem, what's missing but within some domain, what is the balance there? Do people know enough about for example among layer twos do people enough about this layer two? This layer two we have to watch how things are happening in the ecosystem and also making sure we support to maintain the value sorry, maintain the values but also maintain the balance and that's really not an easy work. And then I really appreciate the hard work our EF people are doing and I have great people in the team that who understand this. I'm the one who is making sure they understand it but once they understand it they're the one that who is doing the hard work.
00:39:54.496 - 00:40:24.050, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think because a lot of the people. At the EF are not always on the spotlight because they're not the next project a million people are flocking to immediately or the loudest on Twitter or something. They don't get enough credit. And I want to kind of just thank the entire Ethereum Foundation team for making this entire space possible and pushing forward everything that's happened that we are excited about and we get to use and talk about on a day to day basis. So I think they deserve a big round of applause.
00:40:25.110 - 00:40:27.634, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm more visible one, but there.
00:40:27.672 - 00:40:30.502, Speaker A: Are and a lot of them aren't there, so thank them in person, too.
00:40:30.556 - 00:40:52.640, Speaker B: There are a few here Chris from ESP. He's the one from the Ecosystem Support Program. So if you have any questions about grants and how the grants work, like the question that I mentioned, like what kind of questions they would ask, go to talk to him.
00:40:56.530 - 00:41:12.098, Speaker A: And this is kind of the setup that we want, which is everybody is here, and you get to have a natural conversation where both parties are interested in helping each other. I think this is a perfect thing to end on. We have two questions here. We'll kind of jump right in, and then we'll move on to the rest of the talks. Please.
00:41:12.184 - 00:41:37.130, Speaker C: Hello. First, I want to say thank you for all the work that you're both doing to empower people and teams in the ecosystem. And I wanted to know what your vision is for Ethereum playing a role in charter cities, pop up cities, network states. What role do you think it can have in the development of those cities?
00:41:38.030 - 00:42:21.260, Speaker B: What role Ethereum plays? EF well, I think it's one of the tool that is helpful for everything you said. But again, you can build applications in any way. You can build the governance in any way. So that's a lot of governance challenges that are happening in normal state or governments. Hopefully, they can do interesting experiments for regular governments to learn. I think there's a lot potential there.
00:42:22.350 - 00:42:23.434, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
00:42:23.552 - 00:42:24.220, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:26.830 - 00:42:28.300, Speaker D: Test one, two, three.
00:42:30.350 - 00:42:31.226, Speaker A: It's working. Yeah.
00:42:31.248 - 00:42:48.660, Speaker D: So I just had a question. In terms of adoption and adoption, specifically in Japan, what applications do you believe will be successful? Some ideas I have are maybe, like, public goods for philanthropy or maybe vending machines or some other IoT robotics projects. I was just curious about that.
00:42:49.110 - 00:43:28.240, Speaker B: Do you live in no? Oh, okay. I thought you already have more idea than me. So that's something actually, thank you for a good question, because we didn't get to cover. I do think Japan has originally I thought, okay, there's trust here already. Do you even need blockchain? Right, that was a question. There's an honest question that I had, but then I realized that there is certain talents that are very unique in Japan. Like, things like, I don't know what you're fascinated about.
00:43:28.240 - 00:44:28.062, Speaker B: Know? Could be game gaming or even anime or like a creative side of things are great can, but it doesn't have to be in that industry. But also because there is already some kind of trust. And like I said, the good coordination and teamwork people are pretty good at that here. So I think even the innovations in DAOs are going to be more unique and different. Even. Like yesterday, I was joining some this Tokyo plurality event, and then they were explaining some dows that some teams are working on. And then what's interesting is actually Japanese people less care about commercial things in the deep culture.
00:44:28.062 - 00:44:57.130, Speaker B: There are a lot of bookports like profit making and businesses are there, of course, but the culturally, people care about quality over profit. So that's something I'm hoping that can add or teach something to this ecosystem. And I'm already seeing some really interesting project data. Oh, I don't think this can work outside of Japan.
00:44:57.950 - 00:45:16.510, Speaker A: I think one thing we were discussing a few days ago was just the notion of a lot of clubs here in the sense that it's a membership or being part of a community is a very common pattern from that's. Defining a dow basically in a lot of common terms, just being part of an ecosystem.
00:45:16.670 - 00:45:51.530, Speaker B: Yeah. One interesting is there are many point systems that are already well developed. Like, if you go somewhere, like, you ask that, do you have this point card? So there are other things, like web3 can help and improve existing things because there's already existing structures, that improvement will be interesting to happen. I don't know if I answered to your question.
00:45:51.600 - 00:45:52.474, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you.
00:45:52.512 - 00:45:52.970, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:45:53.040 - 00:46:00.720, Speaker A: I personally love sending it to Greent ETH and just something coming out of a vending machine. So if you're going to work on that, that'll be great.
00:46:01.250 - 00:46:17.006, Speaker B: Yeah. If that's like, actually, because I'm Japanese, I may not be paying attention to something that is very unique if you come from outside. So that's like, I love hearing those ideas, and that might be maybe you can teach Japanese. Hey, this is actually unique.
00:46:17.118 - 00:46:24.102, Speaker D: Yeah. I have a prototype for something like this called Way Gold, where you buy gold with ethereum and has, like, a pair for it.
00:46:24.236 - 00:46:24.822, Speaker B: Cool.
00:46:24.956 - 00:46:30.902, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for joining us, aya and for kicking off this event.
00:46:31.036 - 00:46:31.382, Speaker B: Yes.
00:46:31.436 - 00:46:31.702, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:46:31.756 - 00:46:33.140, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
