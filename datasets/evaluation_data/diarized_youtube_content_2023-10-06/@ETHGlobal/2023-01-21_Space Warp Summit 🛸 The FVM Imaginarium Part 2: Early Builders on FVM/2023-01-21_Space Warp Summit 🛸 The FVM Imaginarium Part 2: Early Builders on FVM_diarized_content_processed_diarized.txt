00:00:06.090 - 00:00:06.446, Speaker A: So yeah.
00:00:06.468 - 00:00:41.830, Speaker B: So jumping into our next talk, Matt's going to join us back and joined by a co host, Sarah from Protocol Labs as well. And this is really exciting talk. It's going to be talking about now what is the early progress of people building on top of the FBM. So we're going to be joined by Lamont, by Ren, by Karen, by Mendit, and by Ilya, who are going to be in panel. So a really big panel hosted by Sarah and Matt from PL about kind of the current state of building on the FDM and I will let them take it away. I just want to make sure everybody's on boarded here. It's enough people that off my screen.
00:00:41.900 - 00:00:42.246, Speaker A: There we go.
00:00:42.268 - 00:00:45.900, Speaker B: Folks like Sarah and Matt are both here, so I'll let you guys take the lead.
00:00:46.430 - 00:01:03.962, Speaker C: Thank you, Jacob. Yeah. Once again, really nice to be here again with the Eve Global Community. My name is Sarah. Nice to meet you. If we haven't met before in the ecosystem somewhere, I am a developer advocate with the FPM team. I also run the early Builders program for FPM.
00:01:03.962 - 00:01:43.660, Speaker C: And so that means we have a whole host of people that came on when we had plans, but things kept evolving and things are still evolving, but they were brave enough to join into the program and build and hack and fix together with us. And it started back in September and now we are about five months ahead. Now. They've had a lot of maturity in their projects and so we wanted to feature some of these early builders today to kind of showcase what they've built so far, what their journey looks like. And so that could be you in a few months to come. So really looking forward to that. Before we get to introduce our panelists, Matt, do you just want to kind of say hi and say a few words?
00:01:45.010 - 00:02:06.674, Speaker A: I will do. I don't need to say much, I don't think. I was just on the last talk already talking quite a so on the last talk, JB and I talked about the kind of things you can build on the fem. And I guess we're getting a lot more concrete now and talking to people who are building on the fem already early in their progress. But we get to hear from them as to how they're actually getting.
00:02:06.872 - 00:02:20.410, Speaker C: Yeah. Awesome. Okay, so we'll do introductions. We kind of want to hear from all these early builders and please introduce yourself and give us a good overview of what your project is about. Maybe we can start with Lamont.
00:02:21.790 - 00:02:23.402, Speaker D: Hey, how's everybody doing?
00:02:23.536 - 00:02:24.700, Speaker E: Can you hear me?
00:02:25.630 - 00:02:26.426, Speaker C: Great.
00:02:26.608 - 00:02:27.340, Speaker D: Perfect.
00:02:27.710 - 00:02:28.122, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:02:28.176 - 00:03:20.300, Speaker D: So I am actually one of the developers. Jackrabbit Finance is actually a decentralized exchange that will be launching on the you know, we're running quite a few different features, but one of the main ones is we plan on having a bond marketplace utilizing on chain storage bonds and tokenized debt in a more high level sense. And yeah, for the most part, our project is moving along pretty well. I guess we'll go more into that a little bit later on. But yeah, we'll have a number of different features coming out to the Fem very soon, and we started in the ETH Global hackathon as well. That was just a couple of months ago.
00:03:21.070 - 00:03:55.938, Speaker C: Yeah, I remember that. And then you joined the program and I was so excited. Yeah, there are a few of you here as well that have come from the hackathon. So the East Global community is a really great community to work together with. I totally forgot to also share all the logos of all the teams, so I'm going to share that up right now. I didn't want to do it while you were talking halfway lamont just to so that everyone can kind of see all the different teams know, make sure you look out for all these exciting teams and their logos and you'll know when you see it and definitely check them out along the way. So we'll move on to the next introduction.
00:03:55.938 - 00:04:01.302, Speaker C: Karen, do you want to share and kind of say hi? Yeah, sure. Hi, everyone. My name is Karen.
00:04:01.366 - 00:05:12.640, Speaker G: I'm the product lead of Spendao. So we also started at the Hacker FM hackathon in mid November, and then we joined the F-A-M already builders program. So Spendow is a data dow that allows consumers to monetize their credit card transaction data. So there are three main problems that we're trying to tackle with our product. So the first one is all the centralized entities, corporate entities are extra adding all the value from monetizing credit card transaction data, which is a data market that's valued at more than $100 billion right now. And then the second one is that there is a lack of ownership and governance for consumers over their personal credit card transaction data. So the product that we're building is trying to address the need for formulating a positive sum network for consumers and users to coordinate and pull their data together.
00:05:12.640 - 00:05:14.878, Speaker G: Excited to be here.
00:05:15.044 - 00:05:18.340, Speaker C: Thank you, Karen. Okay, Ilya, do you want to go next?
00:05:19.510 - 00:05:38.834, Speaker E: Yep, I'm always ready. So I have this amazing T shirt here. It's actually the T shirt from the first VVM hack that was happening like a couple of months ago. So we are super excited to participate this time with a stable testnet. Thanks to the guys. Thanks to the team. Super excited.
00:05:38.834 - 00:06:32.138, Speaker E: Super thrilled. So we are building market XYZ. It's a platform for metaverse builders where creators can perpetually store, sell, buy, and gift any kind of 3D models and metaverse spaces. And we really see Filecoin as the essential foundation of the interoperable metaverse. And we see the metaverse as actually as the new 3D Internet, like the new interface to access the World Wide Web for the new generations. So we are super excited to build on VVM because we have invented an absolutely unique feature, we call it EFT encrypted file token. So we have modified an ERC 721 NFT and we have attached like a file guide storage to it.
00:06:32.138 - 00:07:04.066, Speaker E: So we have invented an NFT with hidden content and for now we have been researching pretty deep and for now it is only possible on VVM together with Filecoin. And we are super excited to be a part of this amazing community. And we really believe that the Filecoin team has a unique concept and unique vision since like five years already. We can see that, but we also see that the community and the team is somehow different from many other projects and we are super happy to be part of it.
00:07:04.248 - 00:07:12.950, Speaker C: Awesome. Yes. Always feeling your super strong energy. Ilya love having you in the community as well. All right Nandit, you want to go? Nick?
00:07:15.130 - 00:08:03.510, Speaker H: Yeah, sure. So hey everyone, I'm Nandit and at Lighthouse we are building perpetual storage on Filecoin that allows you the ability to pay once and store your files forever and again. Talking to a lot of developers, we realize that building on storage systems can be done better. Perpetual storage is the key component that we have built, and around that we also have our encryption SDK that can be used to store private data, build token gated applications, and also like our gateways that can even be used to stream 4K videos. But yeah, overall quite excited to be in this panel and I've been in the File ecosystem from last two years. So great to see that. Now we are finally coming up with FVM.
00:08:04.650 - 00:08:21.660, Speaker C: Yeah, Lighthouse. Lighthouse has been carrying the perpetual storage area for Fevm. We definitely look forward to more storage use cases coming up. But yeah, thank you so much for all the contributions from Lighthouse. It's been amazing.
00:08:23.010 - 00:08:32.320, Speaker E: By the way, we have integrated Lighthouse Lighthouse storage and it's super highly recommended for everyone. Guys, Lighthouse storage is super cool and can save you a lot of time.
00:08:32.770 - 00:08:54.360, Speaker C: Yeah, I've actually included so yeah, really awesome to see projects adopting across the early builders cohort we've also included that restores within the cheat sheet. So if you want to check out Lighthouse, it's in there as well. And yeah, if more teams come on different SDKs that can be used, this is what we'll be featuring within our community as well. And then last but not least, Ling Ren. Do you want to go?
00:08:54.890 - 00:09:42.498, Speaker F: Yeah. So my name is NIN, I'm the founder of Project Shield. So project shield involved. Building the distributed compute over farrakhan. So it's a marketplace on Fnvm and also the local protocols. So it enables Led users to be able to spend cryptocurrencies and rental computing instance from storage providers and to access their silver data locally, like via the high speed local network. So then Tuple can run some computation against the larger amount of the data already in the Far Point network and for example, the first use case will be the trained deep learning models.
00:09:42.498 - 00:10:07.630, Speaker F: So we already know there are already the print trained models either in the hiding tree or in the network. So people can run computer instance and download the visibility trained models and just use their own data to fine tune it model and see the results. So yeah, this is still very early and just stay tuned.
00:10:08.850 - 00:10:30.326, Speaker C: Thank you so much Ling. Okay, cool. So Project Shell is also one of the first projects that come out the cohort to focus on decentralized compute. I know there are a few teams that are working on it. Project Shell has a demo already running today. I think what we can do is well, we have a huge community on Slack, the Filecoin Slack talk. If you want to get in touch with teams or check out their demo.
00:10:30.326 - 00:11:02.414, Speaker C: We will see you on our Fill Builders channel in the Filecoin Slack. Yeah, a lot of competition goes on there as well. Cool. So we'll get into some questions about your journey, building out your projects from all of you. This is open to anyone to kind of share what they think and as well as Matt if you want to come in as well with some insights because you've also watched this cohort, we've both been watching this cohort grow over time. So the first question that I'll put out there is why did you choose to build on fevm that anyone can.
00:11:02.452 - 00:12:19.510, Speaker E: Go, all right, I'm going to be the first one. As always, I just cannot hold myself guys, I'm sorry. So for us our goal was that we were trying to attach this hidden content to the NFT and at one point we have realized that thanks to the Fivm, this is like the only network right now where we can build this in a truly decentralized way. Right now our alpha version is running on Polygon together with Filecoin. But there is also a part of our centralized backend which is playing some kind of an oracle helping to transfer the encryption keys to the new owner to decrypt the hidden content. And as soon as actors going to be live on it, because we have it on Rust, we're going to put it just on one of the smart actors of VVM actors, that's the name for Rust smart contracts on VVM. So as soon as we're going to make it, our invention is going to become like a completely decentralized standard and we are also planning on making Filecoin improvement proposal, community proposal.
00:12:19.510 - 00:12:53.346, Speaker E: So we really see somehow there is not enough of talking about that. We need for the Web Three, for the new society, for the justice in the new society, for the new internet, for the new Web Three we need a decentralized storage as a foundation. So Filecoin is playing the role of http in the web three. And yeah, I think we all got to spread the word more about that because it's amazing and cool. Yeah.
00:12:53.368 - 00:14:08.460, Speaker D: And then to basically piggyback off of what Ilya was saying, a lot of pretty much my team's interests was very much exploratory. We were very familiar with Filecoin before, have interacted either with data providers and some of us actually for the most part build products with Filecoin other DApps before. And just the idea of being able to build smart contracts that you can build on top of and use with the File point network, it's kind of mind blowing for us and just go specifically with our own project. A lot of it is kind of exploring what different DeFi use cases now that we could really have for this. We're researching derivatives and futures right now on chain storage. And so yeah, for the most part we've interacted with Filecoin quite a bit before, but given the overall structure, it was kind of a no brainer for us in terms of Filecoin network and the chance to actually build something, put smart contracts on its own.
00:14:09.390 - 00:14:25.714, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, actually this is also the first time that we're hearing from our early builders on why they chose FBM. So this is also heartwarming to hear. For us, it's like a compliment a session. I'm kidding. But yeah, I really appreciate all the input there.
00:14:25.714 - 00:14:30.274, Speaker C: Maybe you have one more person share and then we'll move on to the next question if anyone wants to.
00:14:30.392 - 00:15:06.560, Speaker F: Oh, I hand my yeah. So thank you Dean Sarah, for providing the resources and the wonderful SDB tools. But it may make it easy to build like a smart contract on Fndm. So the project like Shield is actually unique to Barcoin, so it's just highly associated to the data. With the SVM, it just enables the use case or the capability that in the smart contract. We can just access the data.
00:15:08.370 - 00:15:08.686, Speaker C: The.
00:15:08.708 - 00:15:21.570, Speaker F: Metadata and verify which data set manner heights or not easy, just expose the ground truth to the UI. So it's very wonderful.
00:15:24.550 - 00:15:50.640, Speaker E: Actually, I just like just quickly, one last idea. I saw one research a couple of days ago where one guy was putting, according to his vision, like the blockchains that have brought the most value to the existing market. And filecoin was like the first one was bitcoin, then ethereum, then the filecoin, because all other ones, they're pretty much are the copycats and we are like filecoin team is delivering the real value to the existing market. So it's amazing.
00:15:51.730 - 00:16:07.710, Speaker C: Yeah. Thanks so much Ilya, and thanks Ning for sharing that as mean. We look forward to more people building. Our ecosystem for Filecoin is huge and we also see people building up different options. So yeah, really encouraging.
00:16:10.150 - 00:16:33.020, Speaker A: I mean, this is great to hear why you started building on part of the early builders program, why you started building on Filecoin. Net EVM, but how was the developer experience how has it been so far? The good, the bad, the ugly. We got all the praise just now. You can be honest with us. How are things going so far? Maybe, Karen, do you want to kind of share how you.
00:16:35.550 - 00:18:01.510, Speaker G: Okay, so I can share more about because my domain expertise is more on development of consumer facing applications in the Webster space. So for building consumer apps, there's analogy that you are basically putting together their legal pieces from all various different solution protocols, SDKs in the space, right. You put together a coherent solution that works for end users. So I think the main challenge for early builders building on FM or Fevm is that because it's so still early, a lot of existing solutions that are compatible with other EVM chains are not supported on FM yet. I think this is the main challenge. So I think this is something that lots of hackers experienced in the previous hackathon in November and lots of people are facing in the Foundry cohort. But I am pretty I'm very confident that as this ecosystem grows and that we onboard a lot more developers to the F-A-M ecosystem, definitely the support for those SDK solutions will be expanded.
00:18:03.450 - 00:18:35.278, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good point. And partly things have been just developing so fast and that's what we're hoping a lot better kind of going forward with this hackathon, especially with the new hyperspace work. But even with that, even up until yesterday, we're still kind of patching issues, last minute things that have been found. And it's great that we've been able to iterate so fast. And it's great to have the early builders program who've kind of stuck with us through all of this stuff. So it's great. And like you say, hopefully going forward, this should all be a lot easier for people.
00:18:35.278 - 00:18:45.170, Speaker A: Nandit, how was your experience? You've been, I think, a lot more on the nuts and bolts of things. When you've been building Lighthouse, how have you found the experience so far building on Fem?
00:18:45.910 - 00:19:17.946, Speaker H: Yeah, I think the good part, obviously, is it's EVM compatible. So we need not learn our new language. Like Solidity can be used here. And the tools that we use on other systems, like harded Remix, et cetera, they work here as well. If people want to go into smart contract auditing work, the tools that can be used to audit your code, that can be used here as well. So I think that's pretty good part. I think one bad part is the test network getting reset.
00:19:17.946 - 00:19:48.662, Speaker H: So we're almost like, okay, but now I think this hyperspace, this test network which is coming up, is now more stable work, more than the previous wannabe. But overall, I think being EVM compatible, most of the tools are already available in a way. But still now we are now figuring out, okay, what core things we can do with the filecon sole library that's not possible on other EVM based chains. So that is one of our focus in the team.
00:19:48.716 - 00:20:18.250, Speaker C: Right? Yeah. Thanks so much for sharing that. And how about Ning, Ilya, lamont also checking in. I think all of you came from different areas, I know, at different points in time in meeting the teams. Some of you have come from, I think I've seen you at conferences and then slowly we started building together and then some of you have come from hackathons. What has your experience been?
00:20:19.500 - 00:21:01.092, Speaker D: I can go and say for the most part my experiences and for other members of my team, it's actually been relatively I don't want to use the term easy, but it's been relatively seamless. There we go. For the most part in terms of resources that have been available to us, we've been able to pretty much go ahead and utilize those resources. The Fevm is EVM compatible, so quite a few of us were already Solidity developers and for the most part just kind of moving over. It wasn't that much of a problem.
00:21:01.146 - 00:21:01.750, Speaker E: For.
00:21:03.560 - 00:21:11.290, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I think huge that we chose to be VM compatible. I think that made a huge, huge difference. Sorry, Ilya. Go ahead.
00:21:12.540 - 00:21:50.272, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's just what you said, Sarah. That's super important that you guys have chosen the first launch EVM. That's super important because the Solidity community is huge and our whole background also comes from Solidity. So as Karen said, it's going step by step. So some stuff is still missing, but we can see the whole thing is moving quickly in the right direction. And we have also great support from the filecon team itself, so we have no troubles, but of course we want more. But yeah, no trouble.
00:21:50.416 - 00:21:57.750, Speaker C: Really. Okay, I remember all that conversation. No, but I hear you on that.
00:21:58.920 - 00:22:42.944, Speaker A: I think that's an interesting point there about kind of with the Ethereum side. I mean, that was actually a change that was made originally. It was going to be the native actors, the Rust and WebAssembly and all that lot that was going to be developed first. And then there was a change to move towards doing the Ethereum virtual machine ahead of time as the first priority for exactly the reasons you mentioned, that people could move over, they could port stuff over. Some people have mentioned yourself already that you're already running like part of it on say, Polygon or another EVM blockchain and then moving over as need be. So I think that's helped people get up to speed a lot faster, which has been great. So yeah, anyone else want to contribute.
00:22:42.992 - 00:23:18.910, Speaker F: About how it was actually? So to me the experience is very good also a plus one only at EVM compatible. So at this point we can just let our smart contractor insolidate and use just the traditional Solid h like developing tools like hard hack. And the process is very smooth to me so far. So waiting for the mayor API the actor SDK to come out.
00:23:20.160 - 00:23:51.636, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. And I think one important thing to know as well is that the Fem is meant to be VM agnostic. Right now I'm building for Ethereum compatibility. But if we get it right and we do it in the right way, it's not meant to be specific to Ethereum only. We want to be able to open up to other I mean, of course we love our Ethereum community and we'll keep supporting and maintaining that along the way. But yeah, definitely more compatibility to come and more foreign run times to support. Okay, so we'll go into the last part of our panel.
00:23:51.636 - 00:24:20.100, Speaker C: I think this portion is like we have two questions here. This page is around how you would advise all these other excited, super excited hackers. We have a huge amount of registration that the numbers are still going up as of now. So a lot of people will be new. Some people are experienced as well. What is one really useful resource that you used in building Fevm? Or whether it was understanding Fevm or building it, what was one really useful resource?
00:24:24.310 - 00:24:32.606, Speaker E: The Cheat Sheet is the best one that's this doc where everything is. So use this one. I think it's yours, right? It's your work, Sarah.
00:24:32.638 - 00:24:36.482, Speaker C: Right. Yeah. It's compiled it yesterday.
00:24:36.546 - 00:24:43.480, Speaker E: I think it's awesome. I just checked it out. It's amazing really. That's the one and only you need, guys.
00:24:44.090 - 00:24:51.514, Speaker C: Thank you. But yeah is you. Aside from the cheat sheet, I would.
00:24:51.552 - 00:25:33.560, Speaker D: Actually say that you guys are the Fem team have actually been a spectacular resource for us. Being a part of the early Builders program, just interacting with you not just on Slack but discord and even having some Telegram groups, it's been huge because for the most part the team is very responsive and that really kind of helps us because as much there is documentation out there but unfortunately there's not that much. And so having a responsive dev team out there that we can go to on a number of different chats, it's really great.
00:25:34.490 - 00:25:58.062, Speaker C: That means so much, not just to me, but I'm sure to our whole team. Matt has felt it and we're just two of like 20 plus people that have and partners that have been working nonstop and trying our best to respond to things. But we understand things are building really quickly. It's not particularly easy piece to understand just off the cuff because it keeps changing daily and weekly. So yes. Thank you so much for saying that. Glad to know that.
00:25:58.062 - 00:25:58.830, Speaker C: It's.
00:26:01.670 - 00:26:19.766, Speaker A: Certainly means a lot. Know, like Sarah said, there's a big team behind this that has made this possible and the engineering team have just been moving so fast on building know, Sarah, Zach and myself have been trying to keep up and there's just new features coming the whole time.
00:26:19.788 - 00:26:19.926, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:19.948 - 00:26:42.958, Speaker A: We've got to demo something and it's like oh, there's something new cool that's coming. Mean, I remember we turned up in Lisbon and literally MetaMask integration happened like the day before we landed in Lisbon and we were demoing it. So it's amazing. And the fact that the engineering team are there and accessible, we do all the work out in the open, right? Well, the majority of it you can see on slack. So it's great.
00:26:43.124 - 00:27:10.062, Speaker C: We have a great community that just is open to try. So I would say a little far hype about that. This is just me putting in my two cent. Or advice is you'll try things out, it might break. If you see a bug, like we are super responsive, put it in the discord, put it on the slack, we'll get through it ASAP. So, yeah, thank you for trying things out with us, but yeah, sorry, Karen, you were about to say something. Oh, you're on mute, I think.
00:27:10.062 - 00:27:12.174, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I was just going to.
00:27:12.212 - 00:27:38.630, Speaker G: Make a suggestion for all the hackers. So we talk about like Meta knight or briefly talk about the challenges of building on FM, I think. What challenges create opportunities for hackers. Right. So if there's something that you see, it's not available, not supported on FM yet, build it. Build it and make it available to the community. And that would be highly valuable and appreciated.
00:27:39.870 - 00:27:42.954, Speaker C: Code of 2023. Yeah.
00:27:42.992 - 00:27:53.980, Speaker G: So for instance, Genosis Multifig is not available, not supported FM yet. So build one. Yeah, that'll be great.
00:27:54.770 - 00:28:25.958, Speaker A: And that's been great. We've seen so many of the community building tool around as well to help everything from the block explorers to little tools and bits of demos and readmes and some fantastic blog posts and Twitter threads that have all come from the community. And sometimes it's like the first time we see about them is when they get published. It's like, oh wow, that's awesome. So it's great to see the community helping each other out. And I've already seen in the discord people from the community helping each other out with information about filecoin, so that's really cool.
00:28:26.124 - 00:28:44.430, Speaker C: Yeah. So I know we're almost at time. I do want to do a quick exercise just in case, if you're watching. It's been a lot of information to absorb. We hope you watch back or you've enjoyed it. What is one word that everyone can kind of take away from each of you? For advice, for doing great in this 30 day hackathon.
00:28:48.340 - 00:29:23.140, Speaker E: I have one quick message. Can I also add something? I wanted everyone, I just really want to use this opportunity because the second round of Impact Evaluator is coming. So the Corey is going to be talking about this after us. And I wanted to ask everyone to vote for our project Mark 3D XYZ because it's so hard to promote it somehow. And we have this voting system where we are voting for each other. So, yeah, I'm just using this chance, guys, so please vote for us, okay. On the hackathon.
00:29:23.300 - 00:29:40.480, Speaker C: Okay, in that spirit, I will let everyone also just say their team project name one more time in case you want to also promote your team to be voted on. So, yeah, one word advice for hackers and then your team name just to close off. Yeah.
00:29:40.630 - 00:30:03.510, Speaker H: My advice for the hackers would be on just have fun and build something that you can show to people. Just not stay at the local host, make it live and just have fun. Build with other developers and keep continuing what you build even after the hackathon as well. And use Lighthouse LG don't miss that.
00:30:06.280 - 00:30:07.030, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:30:07.560 - 00:30:32.400, Speaker D: If I was making a suggestion for everybody, the hackathon, I would say just think outside the box, be creative. And there's a lot of other use cases, not just for the FVM, but blockchain technology as a whole. And you never know, your idea might be that one. You may end up hidden lightning. So right there, be creative.
00:30:34.260 - 00:30:38.528, Speaker C: Word, anything. Yeah.
00:30:38.614 - 00:30:57.560, Speaker F: So my word will be one word. To summarize, the genesis would be engaged. So I feel so though we're just working remotely everywhere in the world, but I feel like star experience, especially new channel. Just stay tuned, stay connected.
00:30:58.780 - 00:31:05.836, Speaker C: Very cool. Okay. Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you, everyone for sharing. Super appreciate all of you. Again.
00:31:05.836 - 00:31:36.150, Speaker C: That was Ning from Project Shell. Lamont from Jack Orbit Finance. Ilya from Mark 3d, Nandit from Lighthouse and Karen from Bendao. Definitely check out all these projects. They have built a substantial amount of progress so far and they'll keep building through this hack as well. Really quickly, I will share just one last resource that you can check out if you want to see not just these teams, but what everybody else has been building. Eric, I just want to share.
00:31:36.150 - 00:32:07.890, Speaker C: Do I have it? Oh, no, I don't have it. But I will share in the cheat sheet, you will have a link that you can go look at all the other early builders and what they're building because we have a total of 116 projects as of today and more being added, this cohort runs for every single milestone. So we will graduate this cohort at the main net launch in early March. And then for our next milestone, we're likely going to have another cohort. So if you want to have a similar experience to what all these people are building on, definitely look out for that. Thank you, everyone.
00:32:09.060 - 00:32:10.290, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone.
00:32:11.220 - 00:32:12.130, Speaker H: Thank you.
00:32:12.660 - 00:32:46.380, Speaker B: Amazing. Thank you so much to everybody on that panel. I know there's a lot of people there, but thank you, especially to Sarah and Matt for co hosting that panel. And of course, all the early mean just to double click on, I think the obvious from that panel. But a lot of the people who are on that panel were people who were in the shoes of the viewers who were joining. The Hackathon that's kicking off today just a couple of months ago. So I think the Protocol Labs team in particular, if you didn't hear it from the builders already, really have turned it into an art form of being able to support builders and projects coming out of Hackathons.
00:32:46.380 - 00:33:09.970, Speaker B: So really just wanted to stress that there's a lot of support both at the event over the next couple of weeks and beyond. And I think using this opportunity to your best abilities and possibly you'll be on stage here at Hackfest later in this year. So just wanted to double click on that. Thank you again to all of our builders and to Sarah and Matt from the team.
