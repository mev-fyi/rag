00:00:00.250 - 00:00:01.390, Speaker A: No doubt.
00:00:06.050 - 00:00:28.840, Speaker B: And the next talk is going to be about ENS. A lot of people don't know this, but ENS domains are ERC 720 ones and there's so much that you can do on top of this thing. And Makoto is here to tell us about the possibilities of ENS and how this fits into the broader identity world in crypto. So without further ado, let's welcome Makoto and I'll let you take it from here.
00:00:29.850 - 00:00:38.186, Speaker A: Hi Kartek. Thank you for introducing us. And I'm just going to start now. Can you hear me okay?
00:00:38.368 - 00:00:39.626, Speaker B: Everything is great.
00:00:39.808 - 00:01:02.250, Speaker A: Cool. Let me share. Okay. May I start? Yeah. Okay. Hello everybody. So, yeah, this is about ENS and I just wanted to do a quick introduction.
00:01:02.250 - 00:01:31.110, Speaker A: And in Ethereum world we have something called like Ethereum wallet and address. So according to in kind of on chain world, I'm known as zero x five, A 384227, blah blah blah. But obviously no one remembers. So we have ENS for that. Hence, I have a well known ENS name called Matokun East. Actually my real name is Makoto. But yeah, in the ECM world, I am Matokun East and I'm a developer.
00:01:31.110 - 00:02:16.690, Speaker A: ENS Team And I've been working in ENS team since 2018. And today I want to talk about so it was a ground vision. It was a title my colleague Bradley Put and he unfortunately have some flight schedule chance so he can't give his ground vision. So this is my interpretation of the ground vision. We as a ENS team, we kind of share the same like because I kind of watched ENS to kind of start and they're just kind of flawless. So I wanted to quickly recap how it came where we are right now. And also we have a kind of new vision.
00:02:16.690 - 00:03:22.634, Speaker A: We used to say ENS came heavily borrowed from the name DNS domain name system. So we keep thinking, yeah, we are the kind of Ethereum kind of name service which is almost like a domain name system, but we kind of start realizing that self, realizing that it's actually would be more than that. So we start telling ourselves as a Web Three username. So I want to kind of start talking about that transition and that journey just started and we need to build a lot of stuff and we also need a lot of help from you guys. So I want to just end my talk with where is the area we have to focus on and how you can help. And so the handful beginning is that back in 2016, this was June 9 in London. So ENS, the idea of ENS was kind of invented from the guy called Nick Johnson.
00:03:22.634 - 00:04:08.742, Speaker A: He is a founder of ENS and now he is in New Zealand. But back then he was in London. And incidentally, I got into Ethereum back in 2016 about the same time as Nick got in and I went to the fast Ethereum meetup back in April. And when I went to the third meetup Nick was actually presenting about ENS. Interestingly. If you look at the June 9 I think this was the time he was about to join from I think he used to work at Google or somewhere. Then he decided to join Ethereum Foundation as a guest developer.
00:04:08.742 - 00:04:53.610, Speaker A: And ten days after this the dow blows up. So the original dow raised like 150,000,000 and it got hacked and the 30% of the east got like drained, that kind of stuff. So his first job was to basically rescue the Ethereum. But at this point he had no idea what's coming. At that time, I don't know how many people were there when Ethereum that time, but we had that vision as an Ethereum. That vision was the world computer. That whole things about ethereum.
00:04:53.610 - 00:06:05.810, Speaker A: We are the one who kind of compute all the things, do something. And we also had some idea of kind of triangular system that Ethereum is a computer then you also need a storage system which was Swarm. Swarm is basically very similar to IPFS for the distributed storage system but it integrates natively to Ethereum. And also there's another thing called whisper which was a network system layer which is not really actively developed but I think status is taking over the idea and doing something called WASO or something. So as part of the swarm because Swarm had a kind of content ID which is a hash of basically the content you want to upload image or stuff then obviously they had an issue also that has issue of very machine friendly but human unfriendly name. So when he started, I think he was having the idea of ENS and the first use case was let's use it there. So that was a very starting point.
00:06:05.810 - 00:07:12.674, Speaker A: But yeah, at that time he just joined the Ethereum Foundation and he was kind of doing on his side while maintaining the go Ethereum client and about a year later made a Force. Actually I think he initially tried to launch in 14 March, which is a pi day, but as soon as he launched he hit a bug. So he had a retreat and he did another launch back in May. May the force that's easy to remember. May the Force be with you. So that was the actual launch and on this kind of tweet it says I think Kartik said like yeah, ENS is one NFT project and it is actually one the kind of oldest non fungible token may 2007. So this was kind of months before even the crypt punks was born and the standard seven to one didn't even exist.
00:07:12.674 - 00:08:44.446, Speaker A: And during that time also, it was a kind of peak of so called ICO initial coin offering and there's lots of company was doing, raising lots of money and it was the first time ECM as a community hit the network spike that whenever people do, I think Brave did the browser, did their token launch, I think about the same time. And during that time there was a huge spike. So what we did, well, Nick did kind of interestingly is because name based on that, I think if it's a hash of the name or something, he basically kind of spread the name release mint period over the three months. So if some names can be minted sorry, auctioned on this day, whereas the other name is this day because spread over the three months just so that we can prevent people just jumping into one specific moment. So I think it was quite innovative in a way, even it was like four years ago, but he was already thinking about how to make sure it's not going to collude the network. So I wish more NFT projects actually do something like that. So some names are actually auctioned off during the even before the crypt punks was minted.
00:08:44.446 - 00:09:23.374, Speaker A: And yeah, 180,000 names were auctioned over three months. And another interesting thing is it was a so called bickery auction that fast highest bidder paid the second highest bid. So some of the name people, the highest bid was East Phoenix, which was over someone bid for like 200,000 east. It's a humongous amount, but actually no one bid as high as it. So I think that person only paid like 0.1 east or something. Whereas something like a dark market, open market, it was more like many people bid.
00:09:23.374 - 00:10:00.970, Speaker A: So that's actually the price they acquired, which was about 20,000. It was a lot, but in total, I think one hundred and sixty eight k at that time it was about 50 million. Now it's probably like over half a billion. It's quite a lot of money. But the thing is, I think it was the first time people kind of saw the opportunity similar to the kind of.com boom, like people just squat on it, just holding it. And it was designed to make it easier because it was more of the locked system.
00:10:00.970 - 00:10:51.726, Speaker A: So you put a deposit and you can only while there is a deposit there, but if you want to release the name, you get the money back. And the reason behind he did it is that because he was a kind of interior registrar, he didn't know how all things works, so he wanted to make it temporary. And if something happens, worst case scenario, people can get the reset name and just get the money back. So I think it was more of a safety mechanism. That was the initial design, but again, that was auction was through like seven days auction. So it was very difficult to basically for every name, even after the three months period, every time people wants to buy the new name, people had to wait like five days to kind of bid and then rebuild that kind of stuff. So that was really difficult.
00:10:51.726 - 00:11:46.990, Speaker A: So in 2019, after two years, we actually did this so called permanent registrar where instead of depositing the money to kind of get the name, we decided to more similar to how DNS naming system works. Like you pay fixed amount for certain EA. So that's kind of 2019 and then that was basically two years ago. But even after you transition, it was kind of gross. It wasn't really growing. So this is a growth of the mastery registration period is that it was going somewhere between thousand names till 5000 names a month, except the spike of the November. That's when we released the short names, which was between three to six characters.
00:11:46.990 - 00:12:28.170, Speaker A: In 2020 there's a D five summer and in 2021 we became NFT summer and people realized actually ENS is also NFT. And also another thing is when people start seeing ENS name on kind of open sea and stuff, people start realizing, oh, this is not just normal. Like JPEG, he has some utility. So we finally start getting kind of momentum and this is where we are right now. Let me go to next slide. Yes. So from domain to web3 username.
00:12:28.170 - 00:13:03.174, Speaker A: So I just briefly mentioned it initially. So ENS started as kind of some of the UTT functionality to help the visual work computer. And the architecture is heavily kind of inspired by the DNS. So we have a kind of so called domain name system. It has a name but it has a hierarchy. So ETH the top level domain I have Matokun East, and you can also have a notion called subdomains. So these are very similar to how DNS Internet domain works.
00:13:03.174 - 00:14:26.754, Speaker A: But one thing I later found out, I think when we were all in the Twitter space about talking about OGNs and then Brantley, my colleague was asking to Nick, how did you come up with this called reverse record? Is that normal name? You map Matokun ETH to jerks one three, but there's a notion for reverse record if you purchase ETH name and if you go passing after registration is done, it actually prompts you to set something called reverse record where you can basically select your primary name which associated to your ECM address. That's why we call it Rebuild. So in this example, I have multiple names. Like I am matokun east or Matokun Gitcoin east. And I can associate which name represents my same address by doing that. Now, if you go to somewhere like Uniswap, so if you connect the wallet to that DAP, they use a reverse lookup to see which name represents this ethereum address and they show it to you. And this is convenient, right? Especially if you have multiple addresses, you don't want to mix up which address you're trying to do.
00:14:26.754 - 00:14:59.882, Speaker A: Swap tokens and stuff that's useful for yourself. That's what Nick said. Yeah, he just kind of added as an afterthought. So because he kind of added afterthought, it's kind of actually quite hard. It was one of the hardest things to set after you purchased ENS. And even now, I think still only somewhere between 20% to 30% of people names have reverse records set, so not everybody using it, but for people. Who uses it.
00:14:59.882 - 00:15:33.426, Speaker A: It's very convenient that you can almost using as a login system. And it's not just uniswap. For example, openc OpenSea you can actually look up your name using your but like if you look at the artist page. In this case, it's a people pleaser. So people, pleaser picked people, pleaser. As a username in Openc But if you go to different NFT platform, it might not be necessarily available. So, for example, my Facebook username and a Twitter username.
00:15:33.426 - 00:16:04.174, Speaker A: Not necessarily the same. A Gitcoin is the only one I was able to secure, makoto, because I was aldi. But you can't have a kind of consistent username. Whereas if some NFT marketplace connects with same address. You kind of share the same address. Then it suddenly becomes a portable kind of platform agnostic username. That's where people start discovering.
00:16:04.174 - 00:16:38.874, Speaker A: And it even become more useful. When about three months ago, OpenSea integrated this reverse. Record feature so that now if you go to ESA scan to see transaction, you can start seeing that from where to who. It's basically sending transaction. And this is the ESA scan is the address of a pleaser dow. Which is formed around initially purchasing people pleasers. Uniswap art.
00:16:38.874 - 00:17:48.642, Speaker A: But now they formed its own dao and you can see James and Andy are doing something. It's almost showing your own chain history that's now really becoming evictors and one thing we didn't really expect people do is people started putting into not just for Web three system, but started putting Web Two system like Twitter. Nick is one of the first person who did this because that was his creation. Then I think that was about 2019 or 20 someone like Vitalik started doing and now so many people search ETH on Twitter. There's so many people doing it. It doesn't really improve anything, but it's almost showing your kind of, hey, I walk, live and breathe. In ethereum world, people start becoming just a convenient method to start entire that's that's way start coming like this is not something we I'm just guessing what Nick was thinking.
00:17:48.642 - 00:18:28.734, Speaker A: I don't think Nick really did expect that this is going to happen. And another thing, what's happening is we have in a structure so this is a smart contract of the ENS system. You don't need to know everything. So ENS is like huge phone book where there's a name and there's a phone number kind of stuff. But rather than that, this is called registry. But the registry doesn't actually hold your same address, but it also just has a pointer to something called resolver where you can kind of customize what to show and how it showed. And primarily when we started, majority of the use case was to show ethereum address.
00:18:28.734 - 00:20:06.542, Speaker A: But you can actually set something else such as IPFS content hash or like swan quante hash which I show as the primary primary use case. And also just like this is Brownlee's ENS page and he basically puts everything his entire life is in basically on chain and that's how he is using tax record. And then with this base construct I think about a couple months ago that was Zapper study showing the profile photo to their website but it's great but I think I don't know exactly where they store this NFT association information. So we just said okay, why don't we just the text record doesn't stop you can actually put any key and value but we just said yeah, let's come up with a format so you can share if you store once in ENS you can basically should be able to reuse in different DApps. So we just integrate a very basic version. So this is if you look at the text record page on your ENS name and if you say avatar and you can put like it says EIP one five five column one is a net chain ID. So if it's main net it's one, if it's polygon one three seven aggressive then you pick it either ERC seven two one or 1155.
00:20:06.542 - 00:21:34.054, Speaker A: Then the contract is basically contract address is basically equivalent to collection and the 2430 is a token ID. By putting this kind of format we as basically this ENS manager page can actually go into chain and to see not only to see which image it represents but the programmer can also program to see who owns it. And if it's owned by actually this ENS name I can even put the flag to say this NFD is actually owned by this ENS name owner. So I can put something like owner label. So this is another thing we started adding we didn't even have it until three months ago but we started doing it and I think there are a couple of team already started creating avatar JS library and he's going through so many DApps to integrate so I can see that this is coming to many DApps very soon. So this is a kind of alpha leak burntley did I think about two, three weeks ago. So we are almost transitioning into almost like a social network or basically showing your online on chain identity.
00:21:34.054 - 00:22:15.734, Speaker A: This is kind of new vision. We start realizing not just that we had it back in 2016, it's very hard to predict what's going to be four or five years afterward. But we kind of watched how user are using ENS and this is a transition we're going so far. Okay, by the way, this is a mockup. We still have a month away to actually implement it. But not just the UI change we need, we need still a lot more. So this I mentioned, this was the left side, was the kind of vision in Nick 2016 too.
00:22:15.734 - 00:23:14.538, Speaker A: This is a vision of the new kind of direction we are going into five years later. But one big hurdle, which didn't really exist at that time, but now exists, is a scaling issue. And how do we need to tackle and how you can help solving this problem? I'm going to spend next? Probably two, three minutes. So this is how much gas you have to spend to register ENS name. And until d five summer hit, it was literally one of the cheapest NFT to buy. That registration only cost $5 and it used to cost only less than one dollars on gas to register. But now east price went ten X and the gas price went like 1500 X.
00:23:14.538 - 00:24:27.086, Speaker A: So now you start seeing that when gas is cheap, probably it still costs like 20 $30 worth of east on gas. And when gas is very expensive, it's going to go 100. I saw that a few weeks ago when root and also went nuts. There's a 6000 gas way and I saw that someone spent about $2,000 just on gas. That's crazy. So we kind of have to sort it out and the obvious solution is going to basically L two. And we have nick proposed some framework called during which is kind of general purpose of chain data which we mechanism and there's a diagram but I wouldn't explain this because you don't probably understand if you don't understand the architecture of ENS but the visual representation is that what we are thinking is like so registering ETH name will remain on layer one very long time and we are not at the state to choose which layer two is a winner.
00:24:27.086 - 00:25:18.002, Speaker A: So that we should move but what we want to do is we want you to pick the layer two, you want to have your data associated and we have a way I mentioned resolver. So resolver is something another smart contract to decide how to resolve your name. And currently, it's just directory returning data. But what we want to do with this jury model is let resolver point to some web services where it returns the data. And most of the L2 relies a security on the L One. That means there's a way to prove the data on L2 to be in l One, to be able to verify because they anchored all the data back in l One. So we know there's a way to do it.
00:25:18.002 - 00:26:28.390, Speaker A: So what we want to do is if you have Matokund is you want to change the resolver to points to specific L2 and retrieve the data there but this is still, I think highly advanced thing. What we really want to see is DApps or we want DApps to point their resolver to their choice of L2. So like if it's uniswap uniswap says let's say hey, we issued a subdomain to all the users on optimism so that user don't have to buy the name especially the new user don't have to buy the registered name on l One but rather just user subdomains under their favorite app. And if like dYdX wants to issue subdomain they are already in stockware. So let's issue the subdomain stockware. And we have a ways to people update data on l Two of their choice and they should know how to do it because they already use the app. But we have a unified way for people who's not on L2.
00:26:28.390 - 00:27:11.800, Speaker A: If we want to look the app for for example food Dy, DX, we came up with ways to basically read the data through this during framework without you switching MetaMask to change the network all the time. So this is kind of idea stage. We have a proof of concept so that means how DAP adopt this new layer two system and integrate it becomes very key. And we have currently have 286 DApps who already does some level of integration. But we really want them to start paying attention. What's happening. What we want to go to L2.
00:27:11.800 - 00:28:42.866, Speaker A: And the easiest way if you manage one of these DApps or if you are building something for its online Hackerson after, I think week after, actually following day of the East Global Hackerson, we are having ENS workshop for inviting the builder and the developers to talk about all these technical aspects. And I think we'd like to invite some people who are hacking and who hacked with ENS to kind of present in the end of what you achieved and all this stuff. So if you are a builder or if you're hacking or something right now, please apply for ENS online workshop. But this talk is aimed for non technical people. So I am aware that not everybody fits for this workshop but one thing you could do is for example example is a crypts levels page have a crypt punks page and which has now linked to resolve who owns the punks and it shows the ENS name. And I heard from the Disco conversation that there is some community member in crypt punks Disco channel. They kept pushing to the level of guys to integrate and after he pushed so much they finally added it and now it's getting one of the most traffic to our site.
00:28:42.866 - 00:29:50.198, Speaker A: So what you could do is just if you have a favorite app and if you are the Dao member and if you are active, please propose to integrate with ENS and also if you are not an active member, the fast community to maybe join could be the ENS Discord channel as well. So we were very bad of community management, like we were very small team but now Alicia is joined the ENS team and she's doing fantastic job managing all the Discord members. So maybe should pop into ENS Discord channel, just say hi and just show off your Twitter with your ETH name. So that's probably the easiest thing you can do to help ENS to kind of get more integrated with different DApps and it becomes more useful as a username. It's really username. It's only become useful if everybody else use the same web represent their username. And we hope that ENS becomes the ENS workshop.
00:29:50.198 - 00:30:00.540, Speaker A: You can check out more detail on the medium page. Please follow ENS domains Twitter and join Disco and just join our website. Thank you very much.
00:30:02.270 - 00:30:23.060, Speaker B: Thank you so much, makoto. We don't have a lot of time for too many questions, but just two recurring things that sort of showed up and I'll try to see if we can get them sorted quickly. First one is for the layer two integration. What does the timeline look like for people to be able to make their ans changes on the L two? Could you talk a little bit more about that?
00:30:23.590 - 00:31:23.720, Speaker A: Yeah, it's still early, to be honest. So we already have a kind of working example in. So Nick did it with just like on its own and I just was working on porting that example using the JIRAM framework. So that's there but yeah, still, I think for optimism they were also doing the network relaunch, right? So I think it's not ready to deploy immediately, so it's not next few months, to be honest. And also it's not just the platform support, but also we need to have a support on something like ESA, JS web, the library and the MetaMask or the tools. So again, I think we want to make next workshop to be the place where people can discuss about what other DApps are ready to adopt even too soon.
00:31:24.890 - 00:31:49.722, Speaker B: Another sort of one big theme here is that from the diagram you showed around how the layer one ENS can let people spawn different usernames on different layer twos, does that mean people can have a different username across different ENS on layer two? Or does that mean like the identity will still be preserved and the same username maps into things that be a lot of confusion?
00:31:49.786 - 00:32:31.660, Speaker A: Yeah. Currently ENS is non fungible, whether it's ELC 7211. So if you have one name, for example, if you have one name in arbitrary points to different address and another name in polygon or like optimism pointed to different address, you can't basically look it up. What we want to do is I think that one we are still thinking, but what we are kind of thinking is probably there are two ways if it's non ETH name. One thing we didn't discuss is you can now use.com or XYZ using so called Dnsack oracle. That one.
00:32:31.660 - 00:33:09.494, Speaker A: Basically you can prove resolver on L one dictates which name it points to. So whichever like if this resolver says this name, I'm using optimism. Whatever the names resolved in optimism becomes a canonical one. So you may have something else if you do that and if you then say, oh, actually I'll do in arbitrary it may have the same name on different chains but it's the l one which decide which ones points to. So it's always one. Great.
00:33:09.532 - 00:33:15.762, Speaker B: Well, hopefully that clarified the question from the audience. And Makoto, thanks again for doing this talk and being part of the summit.
00:33:15.906 - 00:33:20.360, Speaker A: Thank you. You.
