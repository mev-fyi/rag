00:00:07.690 - 00:00:44.006, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, Kartik. And yeah, I mean, really excited to have both Kevin and Juan here for this quick chat on coordination, on probably the book, the Green Pill book, and then, of course, just public goods in general, which is sort of one of these infrastructure of things that's happening in the space around coordination and funding in the space as well. So awesome. It looks like we've got Kevin too. So thank you for doing this. Yeah, maybe it makes sense to start with a lot of the topics that you cover, Juan, are in the book that Kevin wrote.
00:00:44.006 - 00:00:47.546, Speaker A: Maybe I'll just to have Kevin kind of kick off and do a quick.
00:00:47.568 - 00:00:48.682, Speaker B: Little intro as well.
00:00:48.816 - 00:01:04.722, Speaker A: Kevin, what's the story that kind of led you to writing the Greenfield book and sort of just how long have you been thinking about this? What are your maybe kind of intro thoughts about this space? But just in general, what led you to coming up with this?
00:01:04.856 - 00:01:51.118, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. First off, thanks for hosting this really big fans of ETH Global and of Protocol Labs and Filecoin over at Gitcoin. Basically the genesis story of Gitcoin is that I've been a software engineer all of my career, all 15 years of my career, and I've always built stuff on top of open source software. And open source software creates $400 billion per year in economic value. And the people that are building it don't have a business model because the source code is available for free. And so every time I wanted to build a new startup and I've built a dozen side projects or startups over my career, I would always get an open source database server, open source Web server, open source operating system. Python Django is something I built a lot in.
00:01:51.118 - 00:02:46.878, Speaker C: And so I've derived a lot of value from open source and just found it really sad. That open source because it's a public good, which means that it's non excludable, non rival, risk, doesn't have a business model because it's non excludable, which basically means that I can't stop Kartik from downloading Ubuntu, and it's non rivalist, which basically means that Kartik downloading Ubuntu doesn't stop me or Juan or Jacob from downloading it. There's no way to monetize it. And so basically the idea with Blockchain is that we've got a trillion dollars of market cap that's floating around the open source financial system. What if we could use some of that money to support open source? Because it's an open source financial system, the money that used to go to it on Wall Street in the old financial system could now go to open source. That was like the genesis of Gitcoin. And our mission has always been to build and fund digital public goods, starting with open source software.
00:02:46.878 - 00:03:39.326, Speaker C: We've created $65 million worth of open source funding using quadratic funding and Gitcoin grants. And I'm just so thankful to Vitalik and Glenn for inventing quadratic funding and giving us a game theoretically optimal way of funding public goods. They're the big brains. I'm just the guy who's taking it and putting a neon brand on it and marketing it to so as we went down this path of funding open source in the ethereum ecosystem, I started to discover other great projects that were also working on different types of public goods. And so, you know, some examples would be optimism and retroactive public goods. Giveth and Clr Fund are doing some great stuff. Dev Protocol Filecoin and Protocol Labs has been a big sponsor and so what we realized is that, oh wait, quadratic funding and what we're doing at Gitcoin is only one way that we could move the needle on public goods.
00:03:39.326 - 00:04:50.438, Speaker C: What if we could create an educational and social Shelling Point for public goods funding and regenerative crypto, which just basically means any crypto that has an impact on the world. So the idea behind the Green Pill Book was basically like, oh, quadratic funding is great, but let's actually be pluralistic. There's probably a dozen or hundreds of mechanisms that can fund public goods. Let's be inclusive of those mechanisms and let's create a category of regenerative crypto and embrace all of the other projects that are doing it. And I think that one of the great things about this is the benefits of pluralism is that you get other people who are trying things with other funding sources and mechanics that are complementary to quadratic funding. And so it's the diverse fauna of funding mechanisms in the space that we really want to grow. And we've been supporting that with an ecosystem series called Shelling Point that is the Shelling Point for these conversations and have kind of just stumbled upon Juan and funding the commons who are also doing similar things.
00:04:50.438 - 00:05:48.780, Speaker C: And then the Green Pill book is just kind of like an easy way of teaching these concepts to yeah, that's like the four minute version of how we got from A to and I'm just really humbled that Juan, you've embraced the Green Pill meme in the book and have been teaching some of the concepts. The one last thing I'll say is that these are not my ideas similar to how we took quadratic funding, which is Glenn and Vitalik's idea and we just put a vapor wave neon brand on it and market it. The Green Pill book ideas are the work of hundreds or thousands of really great game designers, game theorists and economists. Man I can't speak today economists, and I'm just like taking it and packaging it up. And the book is a mile wide and an inch deep because I want to give people the rabbit holes to go down. So embracing pluralism is basically the TLDR. Awesome.
00:05:49.470 - 00:05:54.926, Speaker A: Well, thanks for walking through mean obviously it's been quite a journey with know.
00:05:54.948 - 00:05:56.126, Speaker B: Seeing it since the beginning as well.
00:05:56.148 - 00:06:39.690, Speaker A: And obviously we're big fans of Eddie's Global as yeah, I love this kind of tourism that you brought up. It seems like in general, this whole space is so positive sum for the entire world. And basically everything that we've talked about is sort of additive more than it's attractive in any way. We talked about private goods. We talked about kind of rival goods. It's not like those are going to go away anytime soon. But really, as to Juan's point, kind of near the end of his talk, it's more about kind of building these mechanisms and actually kind of having the mechanisms be so good that you kind of outweigh all this kind of gray pill area with all this amazing region and green pill.
00:06:39.690 - 00:06:46.286, Speaker A: One of the kind of questions that got brought up as we're kind of talking through that section was just kind.
00:06:46.308 - 00:06:48.974, Speaker C: Of inherent to all this is this.
00:06:49.012 - 00:07:10.070, Speaker A: Concept of value and good. And the meme, the public goods are good, but value and good is in some cases pretty subjective. I just kind of maybe as an opening question, how do you feel about the subjectivity of what is value and what is good? Are these definable topics? What's your best opinion on there? Maybe we'll start with Juan.
00:07:11.690 - 00:09:21.134, Speaker D: Yeah, so just the easy questions. This is fundamentally one of the hardest questions that humanity has been faced with because it's so there's so many different notions of value at many different layers of the stack, in a sense. And here layers of the stack, I include humanity as different social groups and you as an individual and civilization and the species and all living systems on Earth, and the planet and the solar system and the galaxy and the universe. And so to the best of our ability, we have been searching for notions of value for millennia and ever since we kind of became aware and so on. And, sure, many other animal species and so on have their notions, their intuitive notions of value and whatnot and this is one of the critical problems is, like, how do you orient many, many groups that have many different definitions of what's valuable to them with high overlaps and high distinctions, with things that resonate and things that conflict? And how do you coordinate groups to achieve better and broader notions of value? And there's like a broader division here in kind of schools of philosophy where one track of the argument goes that you can't actually arrive at a definition of value out of observing the universe. And there's a different school of thought that says you can that you can evaluate living systems and you can evaluate communities, and you can based on what those communities are and what those living systems are, you can figure out things that are good or bad for them, that you can actually define the concept of good or bad relative to that living system.
00:09:21.172 - 00:09:21.374, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:21.412 - 00:11:15.474, Speaker D: And so you can think of animals in the natural state or plants in the natural state and what they sort of want to achieve, and you can think of, like, constraining them from that or harming their ability to achieve that as clearly bad for them. And, you know, this is kind of intuitive and a straightforward concept, but that really points out that there's a connection between what we are fundamentally with what's good for us. And so you can come up with some notions of value that are more general than others and potentially eventually arrive at something that's kind of, like more universal, but it's probably not something as concrete or related to what we as individuals tend to kind of aspire to on a day to day basis kind of maybe much more fundamental. But anyway, you can usually sidestep a lot of this by embracing pluralism, as Kevin described, which is you let communities define what's good for them and what they want to achieve, and you come up with coordination systems that enable those communities to interact with each other and work on things that they agree with together and coordinate together to achieve some good outcomes and then mostly try and stay out of each other's way when they're in conflict. When one group values something that the other group does not value or conflicts with, you can come up with systems that govern their shared space and their shared resources to minimize conflict. And so I think at the end of the day, it's like you can define value however you want as an individual or as a group or a community, and that nevertheless, you should still be able to coordinate with many other groups that define value differently. And you can find points of agreement and even in cases where the disagreements are so wide that you maybe don't even understand the world the same way, and that's okay.
00:11:15.474 - 00:11:20.120, Speaker D: You can still coordinate through that, and you can still coordinate to arrive at things that you both agree on.
00:11:24.200 - 00:11:31.670, Speaker B: I don't. Kevin, if you have anything to add on, I'm just sort of assigning value and assigning good to these different things that are coming out.
00:11:34.120 - 00:12:15.072, Speaker C: I mean, one of the ideas that we kind of COVID in the book is the idea that when we think about value, we'll think about financial value. And one of the things that we sort of explore in the book is this idea from Gregory Y. Landua. Again, all of the great ideas in the book are not mine. I'm just like the Meticist behind them. But basically the idea that there's eight forms of capital. So basically, in addition to financial capital, there's living capital, there's cultural capital, experiential capital, which, like, maybe this talk is a form of experiential capital and intellectual capital, spiritual, social, and material capital.
00:12:15.072 - 00:13:23.130, Speaker C: So basically, recognizing a broader, diverse set of what value can be is, I think, step number one. And then recognizing that each community should be free to choose what types of value they want to generate in their community. When I hang out with my Buddhist friends, they want to talk about spiritual capital, whereas when I talk about web three people, it's more about creating arbitrages between web three and material capital, which is kind of what Clemada is doing by putting carbon credits on the blockchain Gitcoin is creating. When we run the Shelling point events and when Juan and Protocol Labs run the funding the commons events, we're creating an arbitrage between financial capital and intellectual capital. And so I just think that recognizing a broad set of values and giving communities the locality and the sovereignty to define which type of values they want to pursue is kind of what this movement is all about. And then on top of that, embracing a pluralism of communities, being able to pursue their own sets of values I think is just a really beautiful world if we can build it. Bottoms up.
00:13:23.130 - 00:13:26.090, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:13:26.540 - 00:14:41.456, Speaker B: One of the things that I feel has been particularly powerful, at least for me personally over the last couple of years have been just being able to put names to these things. I think Wanja kind of mentioned it with actually calling all these kind of the bad stuff in the world it's know, and actually being able to personify it and be able to build these tools and actually name all these know, regen is another one of these like like all these kind of silver punk type concepts. Being able to name these things seems like a very powerful concept to me and I think it's made a lot of this more clear. Whereas you may have kind of taken a lot of ideas and a lot of inspiration from a lot of different places, Kevin. But to be able to succinctly put it down in a single place and name these things and be able to order this is super critical, I think, in being able to actually come up with a solution for these problems, maybe to motivate that. We have seen a lot of things like Klimadao, the move towards more green blockchains, all these different, more kind of regen y type things happening. How do you two feel about where we are right? Like, are we on a good path? I know we have these really big problems that are on the horizon.
00:14:41.456 - 00:14:50.600, Speaker B: Looming climate change, all the things you talked about Juan, asteroids. Are we on the right path? Do we need to do more? How are we trending, in your opinion?
00:14:53.660 - 00:15:51.156, Speaker D: We are doing pretty well and we need to scale it up. So I think today we're doing dramatically better than we were doing a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, our community just think about the crypto community. It is now fine to talk about how proof of work is creating this horrible waste and that there are better alternatives. And not only that proof of stake systems like proof of stake work, but that you should actively replace your proof of work structures with proof of stake work structure or systems of work that produce some useful thing and not just kind of waste the energy. And not only that, but now we have many of these groups, like many of these DAOs experimenting with structures and systems to scale better. We have examples of the first blockchains that are getting to carbon neutral. FalcoIn did this with our own estimate of all the energy use of the source providers.
00:15:51.156 - 00:16:35.976, Speaker D: It's only a fraction of the there's like the largest fraction of the energy use that anybody has done involved with FalcoIn. There's some amount of calculating all of the other activity and then the production of the software itself. Like, think about all of the activity that all participants in creating the software have made or the hardware. The hardware usually tends to be one of the big carbon generation problems. But we can estimate all of those things and we can offset all of them. And so we can get to ideally, we're sort of like on a race, there's a number of different blockchain systems that are right now in a race to become not just fully carbon neutral, but like the greenest systems, the most regenerative systems around. And this is totally transformative relative to where we were two or three years ago.
00:16:35.976 - 00:17:28.920, Speaker D: And so it's massive progress, it's super exciting. However, it's still very small compared to the broader world, right? So we're in a serious crisis of action globally. And so it's this super hopeful think of it right now we have a sapling or like a seedling of what it could turn into this amazing tree long term. And so we have to keep working on this, keep these systems coming, come up with more ideas, scale the ideas that are working and then just kind of use it with the other industries in the world in a super positive, sum oriented way. We should be doing it in a way that is incentive aligned and that is collaborative and causes the rest of the world to orient the same way and get to a better spot. And it's not just script. I mean, like the broader world has been tackling this problem not well enough, I think, and not, not as quickly as we should have.
00:17:28.920 - 00:18:22.250, Speaker D: But I think we're in the I think we're still kind of in time to scale some really fast solutions that kind of not only avert the worst of disasters, but we could potentially curb a lot of even the other problems that we see kind of appearing in three, four decades if we scale the stuff well. Right? So one of the amazing things about crypto is that it scales really quickly. You can go from a mechanism working for a few people or in a small scale like coordinating tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in relative value to handling millions to billions, trillions in a matter of months to years with sort of minimal changes to the structure. So that scalability is super, super powerful. It really is kind of a tremendously long lever to try and solve the problem.
00:18:23.660 - 00:18:35.552, Speaker B: Yeah, that totally makes sense. I mean, you see that even with the quadratic funding that Gitcoin is doing, I remember that started with very humble beginnings. Right. It was a concept. And now it's allocating tens of millions of dollars.
00:18:35.606 - 00:18:35.824, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:35.862 - 00:19:04.968, Speaker B: So the scalability there is pretty impressive to see, and how quickly that's even happened is insane. How about you, Kevin? Is Mal explained? Do you just get to hang out in your hammock in an undisclosed location for the rest of time? Or how do you think we're trending? And maybe to add to that, this is a hackathon people are going to be building over the next couple of weeks. What are some of the experiments you'd love to see in space? Where should people put their effort, do you think?
00:19:05.054 - 00:19:51.908, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. Here in meat space, I'm hanging out my hammock in sunny Colorado. But in the Metaverse, we'll fight Molok or build protocols that can fight Molok, since I think we need to coordinate in order to do it. I would agree with Juan that we're doing good and the community has formed, but there's still some ways to go. I think if you think about it as crawl, walk, run, we're kind of like we've established that we can crawl and now we're trying to walk, and it would be great if we're eventually running. And I think that some of the milestones that you can look at from a macro perspective is that the web three regen community, public goods community, however you want to splice it, knows about each other. Just that niche being established, I think, is crawling.
00:19:51.908 - 00:20:54.936, Speaker C: And what I would like to see in the future is more capital and talent flowing into regen web Three than Dgen web Three. So what would it take to engineer a capital rotation away from the projects that just have the best Ponzi nomics or best marketing and into the projects that have the most real world impact is like the horizon of where I think this space could be going. And there's a lot of infrastructure and coordination that it's going to take order to get. You know, I think that I'll just say know, thank you for your kind words about the Green Pill Book and Gitcoin. One of the things that I think that we really strive to do is be a channel for greater combinations of strength and intelligence to come. You know, when you ask me, Kevin, what should I work on in order to make this vision a reality, the answer is I don't really know. But we have this quadratic funding mechanism that creates a signal map of what the community actually wants to see built.
00:20:54.936 - 00:21:51.960, Speaker C: And so I think having that credibly neutral channel of what does the community want to build is kind of like what I would point you to. And so just to illustrate this point, I'll just share my screen and just show you the economic graph from Gitcoin Grants Round 14 in June 2022, where $5 million were raised for public goods. This is a graph of all of the contributions in Gitcoin Grants Round 14, which was just a month ago, 700,000 transactions. Each edge in this network is a transaction and each node is a user or a grant in the network. So we're building a mesh network that not only sends funds, peers to peer, peer to peer, but creates a signal of what the community actually cares about. And by the way, 700,000 transactions in the round, but it was crashing my browser to visualize all of them. So this is one one thousandths of the economic graph, but it should be like a proportional amount of the economic graph.
00:21:51.960 - 00:23:10.852, Speaker C: So the answer is, unfortunately, Jacob, I don't know what people should be building, but I think that if you look at that data set, then maybe you'll get an idea of what the up and coming projects in the ecosystem are and can get some inspiration from that. But one of the things that I see as someone who's analyzing the data, and again, I'm perceiving the community's preferences, not injecting my own preferences into this, is that we need to engineer more capital into regen Web three projects. If we can create an ecosystem in which we reward projects that can create value instead of just the ones that capture value, that systemically changes the incentives for founders and capital allocators in the space to regenerate the world and create impact. So I'm really bullish on impact certificates right now. So what would be true if every time you took ten carbon credit carbon, tons of carbon out of the atmosphere, you minted an NFT for it, or you took ten people out of poverty, you minted an NFT for it, you invented quadratic funding, you should get an impact NFT or like a certificate for that. And then what we can do is we can build a market where there's demand for these impact NFTs. And if we add a sufficient scale, what we've done is we've systemically changed the incentives of the entire ecosystem to creation of value.
00:23:10.852 - 00:24:02.680, Speaker C: If you're an impact dow that's removing carbon from the atmosphere, you now have a business model because you can just sell those impact NFTs. So systemically changing the incentives, I think, is like the North Star that I'm really aligned on. And impact certificates are one way to do that. Retroactive public goods funding, which Vitalik and Carl have been a big sponsor of, are like the other thing. And then we have to build thousands of DAOs that actually create impact from there. And one of the things that I kind of like to think about, and I'll just end here because I think it's a fun meme, is like we're all familiar with minor extractable value in this space which is basically I'm front running the transactions in the mem pool in order to extract value for myself. So Juan submits a transaction that's about to redeem ten ETH out of some smart contract and if I'm in the mem pool I can front run that and replace his address out with mine.
00:24:02.680 - 00:24:45.936, Speaker C: If that transaction isn't minor extractable value prevented. And so minor Extractable Value is this idea that you can front run the projects that are creating value by being in the mempool. What would have to be true to create Vibes Extractable Value where you're just showing up to these impact owls thinking oh, there's good vibes here, they're creating impact and I trust that eventually Gitcoin and Filecoin and ETHGlobal are going to figure out how to systemically change the incentives in order to make impact profitable. But this is vibes extractable value. I'm here early for the Vibes and I trust that the world will reward me in the future. So I want to live in that. So I guess I'll put the question back to you Jacob.
00:24:45.936 - 00:24:49.380, Speaker C: Which ETH global hackers have good vibes this hackathon?
00:24:49.880 - 00:25:44.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess we'll have to the is basically what we're definitely I think you can also get a pretty I think actually the whole Vibe check thing is real. You can kind of sit down, you can chat with somebody for, like, 1015 minutes, and you can get a sense, like, where their heads are, and you can get a sense on whether or not there will be some vibes extractable value down the line just because of that type of person and where they're thinking and where their head's at. I love that. Maybe Juan I'll turn over to you. I know you love hackathons as well so I know maybe Awakey doesn't know what to build but maybe you do. Maybe I'll put this over to you as kind of the last question is sort know as people set out on their journey to build over the next two and a half weeks it's a long enough time for them to kind of iterate and build something cool. What do you think is.
00:25:48.780 - 00:25:49.930, Speaker D: Let me share.
00:25:50.460 - 00:25:53.516, Speaker B: I love this is like a panel with show and tell.
00:25:53.618 - 00:26:23.750, Speaker D: This is good. Yeah. So you can hear a lot of ideas from Owaki and others in the Greenfeld podcast. Just go through and listen to each one of these. It's also on other resources. Shelling Point and Funding the Commons both have huge video libraries with tons of ideas and tons of suggestions. So just go to these playlists and just grab one at random and if you don't find an idea within five minutes, switch another one or something like that.
00:26:23.750 - 00:27:17.076, Speaker D: And what I would also recommend is check out. I think I'm really into things that create like funding loops and funding structures. So impact certificates like Kevin was describing, there's a deplementation of that called hyperserts, then things that something that also would be really good is ways of. So for a lot of problems, usually you can come up with an incentive structure if you can get the data. So you can usually break down a lot of these problems into hey, first measure, just measure what's going on in the world and get accurate readings of some problem and make sure that stuff is verifiable. You can even start with a simpler problem because verifiable is hard. So just start by measuring what it is today and feed that into a structure that you can create smart contracts around.
00:27:17.076 - 00:27:59.344, Speaker D: Once you do that, then you can experiment with a bunch of mechanisms to try and incentivize action. As soon as you have some mechanism that is pumping some significant amount of value into trying to solve this problem, then a bunch of people are going to show up to try game it and that's when you can recruit the effort to try and make a verifiable thing right. So it is pretty difficult to make some of this information gathering verifiable, but you don't even have to do that to start with. Just like take some problem in the world and measure what's going on and make that measurable thing be accessible through smart contracts. So create an oracle out of that, bring it into this is where can use in the spirit of hack, FS and so on. A file system is a system of files. Great.
00:27:59.344 - 00:28:29.710, Speaker D: So get a bunch of the data about the world, turn it into files, couple it with smart contracts, then start trying some incentive structures until you hit something that works. And then at that point you can worry about having to make it all verifiable and whatnot. Because once you start that incentive loop and get it going, then you start scaling the activity and you make it good. This is kind of how carbon credits started. They first made them, people weren't thinking very carefully about verifiability. There were a ton of problems out of this. But now we have much better, much more verifiable carbon credits.
00:28:29.710 - 00:28:33.230, Speaker D: We solved that problem when we got there.
00:28:34.640 - 00:28:35.144, Speaker C: Totally.
00:28:35.192 - 00:29:01.280, Speaker B: And I think sound advice in general, which is solve the smallest problem first and then continue iterating from there. Especially for people hacking, you don't need to think about endgame today. You just start with an idea, measure it. Like once said, do some A B testing, build something small, see what happens. And then once it gets big, then you get to worry about all the other things that are hard. But for now, just do something cool. Awesome.
00:29:01.280 - 00:29:33.568, Speaker B: Okay, well really thank you both for your time. It's so cool to have you both here and really appreciate you Juan and Kevin for being part of this. All these talks will be available afterwards as well. So if anybody kind of tuned in halfway, feel free to watch it on our. YouTube channel. And then, yeah, to Juan's point, there's an amazing repertoire that was built up over the last couple of years of talks in the space, finding The Commons, shopping Point, the Greenpill Podcast, and among many others, actually. So lots of awesome, cool stuff out there as additional resources to this.
00:29:33.568 - 00:29:35.584, Speaker B: So thank you so much again.
00:29:35.702 - 00:29:36.800, Speaker A: Good to see you both.
00:29:36.950 - 00:30:00.580, Speaker C: Jacob, let me just interject before I leave that I passed along a coupon code for the Green Pill book in the chat, and I think that's going to go out to people who watch this panel. And then there's 99 uses on that, so maybe it will even go out to the entire event. So check out the book and you can get it for free and let me know what you think. Thanks again for hosting. And, Juan, thanks for being a great copanelist.
00:30:01.160 - 00:30:06.990, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you. I really appreciate you coming in and talking to us all about this. Thank you so much.
00:30:08.400 - 00:30:10.920, Speaker B: Thank you so much, folks. Bye.
