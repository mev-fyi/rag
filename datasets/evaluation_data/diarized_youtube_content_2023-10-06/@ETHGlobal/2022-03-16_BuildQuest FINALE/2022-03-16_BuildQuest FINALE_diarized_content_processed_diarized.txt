00:03:05.530 - 00:03:49.574, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everybody. My name is Kartik, one of the co founders of ETHGlobal, and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the finale. So all of you are watching this thing on Ethgobal TV, and for those of you who are joining us for the first time, this is a platform we'll be using for going through all of the demos and all the winners today. And at any point, if you have any questions or comments, especially if you're a hacker and you have any follow up, just feel free to log in, say hi and ask your questions, and we'll be able to kind of answer them on the live stream for you and also for everybody who's joining in and participating in this chat. You'll be getting a NFT POAP for participating at this event. So this event is an EFG Global event. Eve Global is an organization with a very simple mission.
00:03:49.574 - 00:04:46.254, Speaker A: Our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem, and we do this primarily by running two things hackathons and summits. GoQuest was a combination of both. So we hosted an amazing hackathon that spanned the last two weeks and we also did a summit last week talking about everything that's happening in gaming, in the Metaverse, and just how you can use NFTs in super interesting ways. For the hackathon. We're proud to say we had over 630 people participating and building really amazing projects from 67 different countries spanning 16 different time zones. So it was a really incredible experience for us to kind of talk to people from all over the world and learn about what they were excited about and make sure that everybody has a great experience, no matter where they are and what time zone they're in. We kind of put everybody on a map to see where everybody was coming in from and it still kind of blows my mind every time I generate these maps that we have representation from six continents every single time.
00:04:46.254 - 00:05:38.174, Speaker A: It is incredible to see all of you being interested in Web Three from all over the world. And we're super excited to show everything that came out of it today. And not just the hackers, we also had 18 ecosystem partners and over 50 mentors that were here helping out all of our attendees with anything technical to understanding how they can use better protocols or not, sort of do everything from scratch and use existing work that would make their lives a lot easier. And to top it all off, we had $125,000 in prizes, which is what we'll be going into today right after the demo. So if you are eager to know what you won today for your project, you'll find this out very soon. So after all the submissions ended and we went through judging, we got 140 projects that came out of this event. So it was incredible to see so many cool games on this Sunday, and we're going to be showing a few of those projects right now.
00:05:38.174 - 00:06:39.454, Speaker A: But 140 projects that kind of build amazing things just kind of blew us totally away. And on top of that, I want to quickly thank everybody from our partner side that made all of this possible. Specifically, at TFS and Protocol Labs, we also had partners like Immutable X and Ballast, polygon Studio, Stardust Sequence, morales ChainSafe, table Land, quixotic Covalent op Games, NFT Port, Pinata Chainlink, Lighthouse, Dran and CoinOp. All of these amazing partners were there all around helping our attendees really build creative projects and sort of make their lives easier with their protocols and SDKs. All right, so let's go back to the submissions. So this is called the Finale because we want to use this as an opportunity to highlight some projects that we were super excited about from our judging process and from all these 140 projects that were judged. We ended up with a list of ten finalists.
00:06:39.454 - 00:07:55.834, Speaker A: So we're going to be bringing all these ten teams here today who are going to live demo what they built as part of this event and using that as a way to kind of talk about all the cool things that they're excited about and some cool projects that we saw from this occupan. And then we'll go into prizes and talk about everything that every other team won from each of our partners. So, in no particular order, I want to congratulate parcels clash Of Cards, Olliburse, Nifty, Guilds, Shake, Shock, Shattered, Realms, Geo, NFT, NF, 3d, NFT, Bonfire and Metaverse music as our ten finalists, we're going to bring them on soon and talk about everything that they did. And these are some ten incredible projects that are going to talk about everything that they were able to build during Build Quest. And these are our finalists. But before we go into the very first demo, I want to quickly take a second and highlight that just because you were not one of these ten teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong about anything that you did to all 100 projects listed here. I want to thank you for taking the time to participate this event, kind of using this as an opportunity to learn about what could be possible in Web Three and really putting your time, effort, and energy into making something that you are yourself proud of.
00:07:55.834 - 00:08:48.778, Speaker A: And I really hope that all of you kind of continue building this. Whether it's the same project that you want to build on past Sunday or the submission deadline or something new that you want to tackle on for any future side projects or a future global event, please keep building. Our goal is to bring on people who can help you succeed in any way, whether it's through mentorship, being able to answer questions, or being able to get follow on help. If you want to continue your project and take this to the next level. Whether that's wanting to connect to people for advice or making this into a company, please reach out to us. We'll be able to help with any of these things and connect you with wherever you're going. So I really want to thank everybody here and just say that what matters to us is that you're experimenting with these technologies because we're super excited about what could be possible here and we're super excited to see brand new use cases that were just not possible before.
00:08:48.778 - 00:09:38.166, Speaker A: And we hope that you sort of continue and don't get discouraged from this just not being on the top ten finalists list. So thank you so much to everybody again. And with that, I'd like to move on to the demos. And for everybody who's interested in learning about what all these projects were, you can head over to Showcase Deepglobal.com and see the list of all projects that came out of Billquest so you'll be able to see everything, including all 4140 projects, and find out about what they did, how everything works and how things work under the hood. So as we kind of looked at some common themes in these ten teams, we saw that there's a lot of overlap on how people have thought about building some of these projects. So we have a lot of in the ten teams we're going to see here, we have a lot of kind of examples of crypto native games.
00:09:38.166 - 00:10:11.080, Speaker A: We have examples of people building Web Two experiences and making them crypto native by porting some of those aspects. Obviously, we're going to see some really interesting NFTs and related tooling related ideas. And then the last one is just kind of focusing on the metaverse side. We have a lot of cool ways to think about 3D experiences with Web Three technologies. So I'll stop talking. These are our ten teams and I am super proud to bring on our very first project and that is going to be Parcels. So without further ado, let's welcome Parcels to live demo what they built.
00:10:12.330 - 00:10:13.080, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:10:13.850 - 00:10:26.474, Speaker C: Hey. Thank you Cardik and ETH Global for the amazing opportunity. Let me share my screen. Let me just remove the okay, do you see my screen?
00:10:26.592 - 00:10:27.738, Speaker A: Everything is good.
00:10:27.904 - 00:10:30.218, Speaker C: Perfect. So let's dive into it.
00:10:30.304 - 00:10:30.794, Speaker B: So. Hi.
00:10:30.832 - 00:11:23.230, Speaker C: I'm Noe, and I will present you our project for ETH Global Belquest, which is called Parcels. So we're a team of four French engineering students and we made this game within the week. So let's dive into the game. Parcels is a fully decentralized building and strategy game where players own Parcel, which are part of a big common map that you can see here. So you can explore the map and see other players parcels. Parcels are ERC 2721 NFTs and they produces an ERC 20 token that we called Res for Resources. Please note that every asset in the game is hosted on IPFS and uses Falcon via NFT storage so it's fully decentralized.
00:11:23.230 - 00:12:02.278, Speaker C: And also every assets are custom made whether it's like 3D images and even the music and was made during the week. So let's show one of my parcels. Here you have a parcel which is pretty empty for now, I just have a hut on it. Let's add some items on it. So you can add items on your parcel to increase the production of res token. So first let me craft an item. For example we can add a windmill, let me craft it to open MetaMask.
00:12:02.278 - 00:12:42.310, Speaker C: So I'm paying some res to craft it and it will very soon appear in my inventory. There it is so far now the item which is an ERC 1155 is in my wallet. So I own it and now I can build it on the parcel. And building an item on the parcel is transferring its ownership from my inventory, my wallet to the parcel. So it's basically the parcel that is owning an NFT. So it's like NFTs owning NFTs which is very cool because for example if I resell my parcel, every items on it will be sold with it but I can also remove them. So let's build the windmill.
00:12:42.310 - 00:12:58.060, Speaker C: So for now, I have an outcome of 200 rays per day and now with the windmill it should increase 400. Perfect. And the 3D model should load quite soon.
00:12:59.950 - 00:13:00.700, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:04.290 - 00:13:52.986, Speaker C: Should be loading. Okay, perfect. So there it is and it's live updating and now it's updated also in the map. So it's loading the image and now you can see the huts and the windmill, the parcels are you can also display them on the kixotic marketplace and you can showcase for now the contract on the optimism testnet covan. So let me show you now our future roadmap for this game. So the first thing we want to implement is an attack system. So each parcel will have attack points and defend points and you can attack adjacent parcels.
00:13:52.986 - 00:14:46.960, Speaker C: So this really brings strategy game into our game and make players able to conquer the whole map and even to make alliances and all that stuff. So it will really be a community based game. Then we will make a private alpha to get feedback, to correct bugs, to have a good balance, it will be on optimism and to build a community. Then we plan to add more resources and mechanics. So res will become three different ERC 20 tokens so gold, food and water. And this will allow us to add a lot of different mechanics such as different parts of the map can produce more of gold, more of water et cetera. Then we will do some iteration to perfect the game until it's really ready and then we will launch it.
00:14:46.960 - 00:15:30.460, Speaker C: Also for the future, we have some ideas that we want to put into the game. So we will probably make dao. We want to implement the diamond standard EIP. We want to make a super big map, something around like 10,000 to 50,000 parcels. We want to bring metaverse components so player can import NFTs from other collection to display them on their parcel. We want to add some other buildings, especially for the attack defense system, and we want it to be free to play so that it's more affordable than regular web three games. So I think that's it.
00:15:30.460 - 00:15:54.622, Speaker C: We're really glad to have been in this hackathon. It was really cool. We learned a lot, thanks to all the sponsors and all the teams. It was an amazing experience. Thanks to my team especially. I'm really glad they joined the adventure. And here you can take a look at our tech stack.
00:15:54.622 - 00:16:16.940, Speaker C: So we use the React next JS TypeScript tailwind and Ethereir JS for the front end, python Blender and Figma for generating the assets. The storage, as I said, is on NFT storage, so IPFS and PyCon. The backend is using hubhats and solidity. And the chain we're using is Optimism and Kickstarter marketplace. Thank you so much.
00:16:18.350 - 00:16:18.906, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:16:19.008 - 00:16:37.280, Speaker A: Well, congrats for first of all, going first, doing a live demo and nothing breaking and talking about all the amazing things you're going to do in the future. It's really good to see when people are interested in building this further and I'm curious to have others also try this out when you kind of fully launch this on main net.
00:16:38.310 - 00:16:38.578, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:38.584 - 00:16:43.986, Speaker C: We'll be sure to include the ETH Global members in the private alpha for sure.
00:16:44.088 - 00:16:56.230, Speaker A: Be happy to play with this and spend time learning more. Thank you, Garhik. Thank you so much. All right, we are now ready for our next demo, so without further ado, let's welcome the team, Shattered Realms.
00:16:59.850 - 00:17:01.734, Speaker B: Hi. Hey.
00:17:01.772 - 00:17:03.254, Speaker A: Murad having us.
00:17:03.372 - 00:17:32.914, Speaker B: Hi, Murad. This is David, my partner, who we made together this game. So I'm going to present it real quick. I'm going to start with a play test. And let's go. So Shattered Realm is 90s style JRPG, inspired by likes of Final Fantasy Six, chrono Trigger and so it lives on the polygon chain. So now we press new game.
00:17:32.914 - 00:18:16.080, Speaker B: We're entering the realms and it's going to ask us to connect our wallet and it's going to switch us to the Mumbai testnet when the game is fully launched. In order to play the game, you're going to need to have one of these NFTs. But for the demo that is available at this link demo chatterance IO you're going to be able to try one of the four founder characters for free. So let's go. The four characters. There's a rogue, there's a mage, and I'm going to play the cleric. And let's go.
00:18:16.080 - 00:19:11.970, Speaker B: So this island is kind of the entry point of the Shattered Realms. And inside this village, I'm going to be able to discover how things work so much. Like many JRPGs, if you've played any, I can talk to people, discover stuff that's going on unlock quests, get free items. And here I'm going to showcase one of the features we have in the game which is the utility traits. NFTs characters can unlock utility traits such as wood cutting. So for example, I'm going to try to help this woodcutter and he's going to teach me how to cut wood. So I get him his axe and now he's going to ask me to get rid of some zombies.
00:19:11.970 - 00:20:08.978, Speaker B: Let's go. By the way, I'm going to showcase how fights look like in this game. So very much like Final Fantasy Six with the action timer system and then I earn experience points and gold after each fight. So here I'm going to let mysterious forts get rid of all the zombies. Now the woodcutter is going to be pleased and he's going to teach me how to chop wood. So if I tried now I would say I need to learn wood cutting before, but here I discovered the profession wood cutting and now I can cut wood. And here I get one log of wood.
00:20:08.978 - 00:21:21.870, Speaker B: I put this chest for the demo because I want to save time. Here are four more and now that I have five, I going to be offered the opportunity to purchase or mint the woodcutting NFT upgrade which is going to open this transaction. And as soon as the transaction is so right now while it's pending, I can keep playing because we don't want to stop the UI while blockchain activity is happening and just going to wait until this is done. This is done. And now if I would try to chop another logo food, instead of giving me one piece of food, it's going to give me two because I'm an expert, I have the NFT that proves it. I am very quickly going to showcase another feature, it's the exploration. So outside here in the world map in the island, I can use this skill, explore and this is going to generate random map depending on the coordinates where I can fight some more monsters and gather more treasures, et cetera.
00:21:21.870 - 00:22:11.318, Speaker B: I strongly suggest you go check this link and explore as much as you can of the game. And now I'm going to switch to the roadmap. So Shattered Realms is going to be so this entry point, this island that I showcased and we're going to progressively release portals to realms that we publish as the team. And we're also going to distribute our web three plugin that allows people to create these realms on RPG maker. And these are going to be realms proposed by the community where people can try them and can apply to be added to the official realms. So the gameplay like you saw involves exploration. There's dungeon, clearing, collecting ingredients and crafting.
00:22:11.318 - 00:23:07.230, Speaker B: There's going to be an items marketplace where players can sell the unique items they can craft, they can also sell their services, they can own realms, organized guilds and there's going to be a dynamic quest system to generate never ending quests. Owning the character NFT, like you saw, will give you access to these skins, but also some rare utility traits. And other utility traits include blacksmithing, cartography, artificial homesteading and arcan research, where by staking a character that has one of these skills, other players can go to your character and ask them to, for example, repair their sword and you would get rewarded in tokens. That's it. So I'm going to go, by the way, on OpenSea and see if my NFT shows up. And here it is. I have the woodcutter certificates.
00:23:07.230 - 00:23:17.386, Speaker B: That's it. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed the demo and I hope you will join the community as soon as we announce the alpha.
00:23:17.498 - 00:23:33.586, Speaker A: This is amazing. Demo shadowrems IO. So for everyone wants to check it out, you can go ahead. Do this now. I think this is like a perfect example, full of blending in what's already there in web Two and making it more web Three native with RPG maker. So, this was an amazing demo. I'm looking at all the comments from the chat.
00:23:33.586 - 00:23:40.870, Speaker A: People are super excited to kind of try this out. So I hope you give this to them and they get to play with it and this expands even more. And congrats.
00:23:41.030 - 00:23:41.740, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:23:42.270 - 00:23:49.820, Speaker A: All right, with that, we are ready for our third demo. So without further ado, let's welcome Clash of Cards, AYUSH and Team. Whenever you're ready.
00:23:51.890 - 00:24:08.078, Speaker B: Wonderful. Thank you very much. Karthik So. Hello, everyone. Thank you very much for giving us this opportunity. Right. So we are Team Clash of Cards.
00:24:08.078 - 00:24:33.100, Speaker B: As you can see, simply collect, buy and win NFT Monsters and you can play now for free. This is a small looking NFT that we have made, and there are three types of monster cards that we have. One's, a common card that everyone has when they join the game. The second is the rare cards. Quite rare, I must say. And then the super rare, like, really hard to find. And these are worth a lot.
00:24:33.100 - 00:25:03.326, Speaker B: So what is this game? Right, you can buy and sell NFT cards. You can go to battle and win cards. There's something called a weekly leaderboard, and you can collect rare and super rare cards and sell it on the marketplace. We've built it using Pinata polygon chainlink and sequence. The tech stack is really impressive that the teams have built, and it helps us make this game really awesome. This is the team behind the Samyak, Suprita, Pranav and AYUSH. That's mine.
00:25:03.326 - 00:25:28.074, Speaker B: That's me. So, thank you very much for this wonderful opportunity. We can just get started with the game so we quickly get a pop up for a MetaMask can click. It takes some while to retrieve all your wonderful NFDS, right? Since I'm already logged in, I might have some rare cards as well. So let's choose eight cards for a face off.
00:25:28.112 - 00:25:28.410, Speaker D: Right?
00:25:28.480 - 00:25:50.386, Speaker B: I'm going to use my powerful, super rare and rare cards and some common cards that I think I can use. Let's use. So all these cards have high health, right? So. Let's use Fiery So. Wonderful. There's one more card remaining. That is yes.
00:25:50.386 - 00:26:49.990, Speaker B: So let's quickly go for Bot Battle, right? So an MetaMask transaction comes up so that I can stake and move into battle, right? So also at the same time, Samyak on the other side is logged into Clash of Cards, and he's going to play with me since this is a real time P, two P game. So that should be one more MetaMask transaction just to confirm my stake and to enter the game. Meanwhile, let me just show you the marketplace, right? So this is what the marketplace looks like. Here you can buy rare and super rare cards. Of course, the pricing has to be fixed. Right now, we are almost done with the entire beta. Would love to have all of you play this game.
00:26:49.990 - 00:28:09.180, Speaker B: And I think it sorry about that. Okay, let's let's try it again, right? Let's just put all my cards so something with a higher health. Have you joined the game? Yeah. Okay, so let's go this particular demo, then the other one shows up. So that's how it works, right? You add your cards, and then the opponent adds their cards, and your cards kill them again instantly, because this is quite a powerful card that we have right here. Wonderful. We are killing all the cards.
00:28:09.180 - 00:28:47.524, Speaker B: I think Samyak's choice of cards are oh, wonderful. So Samyak's choice of cards didn't really work out. Wonderful. So we have won 98 Clash tokens over here. So what do you do with the Clash tokens that you just want? So you buy stuff at the marketplace, right? So that's something you could do. And also, once you visit the leaderboard, right, you can see this is a weekly contest that multiple addresses have been playing and the amount of tokens that they have. The first on the leaderboard wins a super rare NFT.
00:28:47.524 - 00:29:07.404, Speaker B: The two to fifth place wins a rare NFT, and the rest of them win a common NFT. So this is somewhat of a competitive environment that we have built it in. Wonderful. That's it from our side. Thank you for listening to Clash of Cards. Thank you, Karthi. And you can go yourself and play it on Clash of Cards.
00:29:07.404 - 00:29:11.250, Speaker B: Probably there's a minor hiccup. Let's fix it in the next ten minutes.
00:29:12.180 - 00:29:49.020, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, congrats on making this demo work. And I know it's always one of those nervous moments where you don't know if live demos are going to go as expected or not, but I think for everybody listening in, this is just a super simple but amazing and creative game. And I think the best thing about all this is that this and a few other projects you're going to see today are already available live. So you can just head over to Clashev Cards and check this out. So, pending that minor bug, which should be fixed soon, you can all try these things out immediately and share more feedback with the team so they can improve these games. So, congrats again.
00:29:49.020 - 00:29:59.090, Speaker A: And with that, we are ready for our next demo. So, next up we have Geo NFT. I'd like to welcome the Geo NFT team up on screen. So Ayusha and Ishika, feel free to get started.
00:30:07.650 - 00:30:48.922, Speaker D: Hello everyone. Welcome to Geonft. We're going to take you through the project we worked on for Eph Global, made by Ishika, myself and AYUSH, my teammate. So what is Geonft? Geo NFT is a platform where Geolocation based NFT drops happen that help make NFTs exclusive, fun and more interactive using AR. It's a play to earn game. Now, how is it a play to earn game? So brands and creators drop their NFTs for users to go find them in the real world using clues that are posted on the app. Each NFT hunt and each NFT drop is a different game.
00:30:48.922 - 00:31:48.910, Speaker D: On the app, we have free as well as paid game for our users. Why did we make this? It was an intersection of the real world and the virtual world and it adds value for the users and creators. And it's basically a digital treasure hunt that we have. Why? Again, I think it's a new way for brands to really market their NFTs because this can be a good way when you're at various gatherings like malls, exhibitions and events. It can add a layer of exclusivity to how NFT hunt happens right now. So how did we make this? So, first is brands and creators choose different types of clues they want to input and we generate it for them. And our aim is to make it as dynamic as possible for them so that the users enjoy the search even more.
00:31:48.910 - 00:32:23.210, Speaker D: So how do you use it? You connect your wallet using Sequence. You provide location access so all the NFD drops that might be near you are shown to you. Then then you find your first clue, you go to the location that you have found in the first clue. Then you approach that, you go to the second clue and this is how you find and claim your final NFT. But only when you are at the location and you can see it through your camera. This is our text tag. We view sequence IPFS covalent morales NFT port and pinata.
00:32:23.210 - 00:32:27.020, Speaker D: We'll see the demo now.
00:32:28.430 - 00:32:50.580, Speaker E: So let's see a quick demo of our app. So this is the Explore game screen where I can choose the game I want to play. So I chose the Pixel Guns game. Then I choose an avatar. I choose this. So then I'm taken to my location and my avatar is my marker. So you can see that I'm here.
00:32:50.580 - 00:33:29.920, Speaker E: And now I can go to the Clue screen to find out where my NFT might be. So this is my clue. It's an anagram of where my NFT might be. So let me try entering something. And yeah, this is the location. So now I can go to the map. As you can see, it shows that my NFT is around me, so I can open my camera and look around for it.
00:33:29.920 - 00:33:56.760, Speaker E: So as you can see, this is my camera view, and I see that I've got my NFT and now I can go ahead and claim it. When I claim it, I'm taken to my sequence wallet. So here I will connect my wallet and go ahead and mint it. So, yeah, that's pretty much our demo.
00:33:59.370 - 00:34:28.594, Speaker D: We'll see what we have next in store for Geo NFT. So we want to keep all the NFTs secure so that there's no geosproofing. So that will be our next step. We also want to create a smooth experience for brands to display NFTs and again, make the clues as dynamic as possible. And we also plan to launch it really soon, which is maybe next month, and also have it in VR mode for you guys. So thank you. Thank you for giving us this opportunity.
00:34:28.594 - 00:34:31.202, Speaker D: It was really fun doing this and.
00:34:31.256 - 00:34:32.740, Speaker B: Yeah, that's all.
00:34:36.870 - 00:34:58.490, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, thank you so much for that demo. And yeah, it's really cool to see you bringing in this with the real world. And I think this is like a really cool experience that now, especially when in person events are coming back, this will be fun. So hope this kind of continues being built and we get to see this in the real world sometime. Congrats.
00:34:58.990 - 00:34:59.980, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:35:00.750 - 00:35:07.200, Speaker A: All right, next up we have Oliverse, So Chan, and Hanwei. Whenever you're ready.
00:35:16.630 - 00:35:40.920, Speaker B: All right. Thanks, Karthik. It's good to be back again. And my name is Hanwi, and together with my friend who is in Malaysia right now, Chen Lian, we developed an NFT trading card game called Olivers. Sorry, just give me a minute. I think I didn't share the sound. Okay, we are back.
00:35:40.920 - 00:36:41.658, Speaker B: Now, this is an NFT trading card game that allows players to customize and mint their own trading cards through Minting. And also, what's cool about this card is that they are tradable in OpenSea and also playable in the. So why why do we build it this way? Well, we feel that NFT trading card games in general are not decentralized enough, and that's because one centralized entity, and that is the game creator, has full control of the rarity of each trading card. And therefore, we want to decentralize the rarity configuration of our game by giving the players the power to create and mint their own trading cards. As a result, the rarity of the trading card is determined by two factors. Number one, the loots or items used by the player during the creation of the new trading card. And number two, the identity of the player who created the.
00:36:41.658 - 00:37:25.450, Speaker B: Trading cards which can be authenticated using the blockchain. Just imagine if you can own a trading card minted by Snoop Dogg. That'd be so cool, right? And so because of this, the game creator has very little control over the card variety as well as the Meta game, which is a game of the game. For this hackathon, we use ChainSafe SDK to enable MetaMask login, and we use NFT port for in game Minting. In addition, all player card item and gameplay data are all stored in table N. And we also use IPFS to store all trading card images and metadata so that they can become NFTs. All right, it's time for a quick demo.
00:37:25.450 - 00:37:49.330, Speaker B: Let me switch over to Unity. So this is the login screen of the game. Let me connect my wallet. It's going to prompt me to sign. My MetaMask, which is on Polygon Network right now, is on the live Minnet. Let's go back to the game. Okay, now let's recruit some new performers.
00:37:49.330 - 00:38:22.458, Speaker B: All right, so you can see here, these are the items that I've collected from previous gameplay. So if I choose comedian certificate, I will get the comedian. But let's say I want to go with the Martial Arts Certificate, which will give me a martial artist. Let's customize further by giving him a fiery background and let's call him friendly. All right. And we'll mint it. So it's minting right now.
00:38:22.458 - 00:39:02.278, Speaker B: And you notice that there is no transaction, no confirmation in this place because everything is done in game, and it's only possible because we use NFT port API. All right, now the Mint is successful. Let's hop on to OpenSea and see if it's there. Well, we know that it's going to take some time for the entity to show up in OpenSea. So I'm just going to show you one of the examples, one of the cards that I have minted early on. So this is how it looks like in OpenSea. It comes along with the properties, the performer, martial artis, as well as the stats of the card as well, which includes attack class and health.
00:39:02.278 - 00:39:41.240, Speaker B: So because of this thing showing on OpenSea, players can always sell it as they wish. Now back to the game. So now I will demonstrate a multiplayer gameplay by playing with my friend Chalyan, who is in Malaysia right now, by going to the okay, so you look for a player. Okay, so now it's his turn. So let me explain a little bit what's going on right here. So these are my cards, okay? And this is the health of the player, which is myself, as well as the two staminas I have. Stamina simply means how many actions I can take per turn.
00:39:41.240 - 00:39:56.362, Speaker B: So now it's his turn. Now it's my turn. Let's try to summon Khope dancer. Okay, so I've completed one action. I have one more left. Let me summon plainly see the card that I met earlier on. Hey.
00:39:56.362 - 00:40:16.500, Speaker B: So now it's his turn. Okay, he in his turn. Let's see. I have two actions, so I'm just going to attack him. Okay, it's still my turn because I have more action. I'm going to attack him again. Okay, you can see that the additional attack actually goes to his health.
00:40:16.500 - 00:40:35.480, Speaker B: Now it's his turn. What is he going to do next? Okay, another martial artist. Let me attack him again. All right, no one left. Let's hit him directly. So his health is low. Now it's two out of ten.
00:40:35.480 - 00:41:16.850, Speaker B: Oh, he said the me win, obviously, right? Okay, now the game ends. So at the end of each game, players will receive items that are dropped during the game. And with these same items that we have collected, players can also use them to customize the cut that we have seen earlier on. All right, let me go back to the slides. So that will be all actually for a very quick demo of Oliverse. And truth be told, I don't have enough time to show and cover everything about the project. So if you're interested to find out more about the project, please visit ollie share.
00:41:16.850 - 00:41:36.762, Speaker B: Also, Olivers.com in between, especially if you are wondering who is Oli and why is he called Olivers? And also please scan the QR code if you would like to connect with me as well. So my presentation will end here, and thank you for the opportunity. Thank you. Amazing.
00:41:36.896 - 00:41:51.614, Speaker A: Thank you so much. This was super cool, and I'm just like enjoying the music in the background. I feel like we got to put that music in the radio for you. Great, thanks. Well, this was super fun and congrats for kind of continuing to build this project from the last hackathon. This is amazing.
00:41:51.732 - 00:41:53.200, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks.
00:41:53.570 - 00:42:01.140, Speaker A: So thank you. And with that, we are ready for our next demo. So next up, we have NF three D. So, Veronica, whenever you're ready.
00:42:04.150 - 00:42:30.220, Speaker D: Hi, Karthik. Thank you for announcing me. So let me quickly share my screen. Okay, brilliant. Now let's start. So, hello, my name is Anna Friedy, and that's my bootquest hackathon project. Before we get started with the juicy stuff, let me give you a quick random of who I am.
00:42:30.220 - 00:43:03.414, Speaker D: So my name is Veronica. I am computer science and AI student, and I've built this project myself. Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the app. So what exactly is NF 3D? Well, in a nutshell, it's a 3D NFT generator that can create multi, that can handle multiple blockchains. It allows you to create your own 3D avatars to use in games. It's here to give second life to your NFT image collection. Now, the big question, how it works.
00:43:03.414 - 00:43:38.530, Speaker D: Let's take it one step at a time. So first, using available APIs, the app gets all NFTs stored in users hotwords like MetaMask or Phantom or Sequence. Then using available APIs, it sends a request to retrieve all the NFDS in your world and their unique traits. It then links their traits with their corresponding 3D parts. And finally, it measures them into one 3D model. To prepare the model to be stored on the blockchain, it converts it to the JSON format. The metadata is then saved on IPFS, the NFT is created and it's sent to your wallet.
00:43:38.530 - 00:44:09.994, Speaker D: And here's a rundown of all the technologies I used to boot this app. Morales IPFS covalent and NFT port APIs blender and free. JS Fantastic. Now let's move on to the demo now. Okay, so here we are on the main page. Let's follow the instructions and log into our MetaMask wallet. Let's wait for it to pop up.
00:44:09.994 - 00:44:28.660, Speaker D: And here we go. Let's go ahead and click the sign button. After successful login, we are redirected to another page. Here we can choose which blockchain we want to work with. I'm just going to stay with Rinkby. And in this slide bar.
00:44:31.190 - 00:44:31.714, Speaker B: We can.
00:44:31.752 - 00:45:14.042, Speaker D: See a gallery of our NFTs. Now choose the NFT avatar you want to mint. When you click on it, you will obviously see a preview of its 3D model, like so. But on Wednesdays we were pink. So I will select this ape to see your produced avatar from any perspective. Obviously, just as I've showed before, you can just click the model and slide your mouse over it. When you're happy with the appearance of your 3D ape, then click Export to export it, or Mint it to mint it on the blockchain of your choice.
00:45:14.042 - 00:45:47.290, Speaker D: So let me try the latter. The pop up might take a while to appear, but eventually it will. So don't panic. Okay? And now let's click the button here. And here we go. Our freedom model is now on the blockchain. If you want to see more about the transaction, just copy and paste this address in the Ifer scam.
00:45:47.290 - 00:46:33.674, Speaker D: And that's that. Right, back to the slides. Let's resume. So what are my plans for the future? Obviously, I would like to expand the number of collections available. The more the mirror, right? What else? I did some research and discovered some fascinating neural network models that would automate the conversion of 2D images to 3D models, which I would obviously like to try. Rather than modeling each feature by hand, there are also certain smart contract features. I would like to try to handle every event, such as transferring the NFD image to the 3D models, but I won't go into too much depth just yet.
00:46:33.674 - 00:47:09.080, Speaker D: Also, finally, integration with other blockchains. For now, it works only with MetaMask and ethereum based blockchains and testnet, but I would like to expand it to include additional top tier blockchains that have launched NFT markets such as Solana, Polkadot, et cetera. There's no limit to that. Now, if you have some apes, crypto punks, or other spicy NFTs in your MetaMask wallet, you might check out the app yourself. Although the software is still in development and has unlimited capabilities. Any feedback is valuable. So you can locate it by following the link right here.
00:47:09.080 - 00:47:22.280, Speaker D: And I believe that concludes my presentation. Thank you so much for your attention, and thank you for letting me participate in that fascinating and wonderful event.
00:47:23.690 - 00:47:48.660, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much. This was a really cool demo. And yeah, just being able to sort of say, here's a neural net that converts two D to three D models, and just applying all these different characteristics and just variants is just going to be super cool. I think this is how we make a lot of things in the metaverse a lot more smoother. And this is awesome. I hope you continue building this thing and generalizing the generation and hope to see this in real world soon.
00:47:49.270 - 00:47:50.210, Speaker B: Congrats.
00:47:51.270 - 00:48:03.560, Speaker A: All right, with that, we are four demos away from going into all the prizes and also just four amazing more demos to go. So, without further ado, let's welcome our next team. And that is Nifty Gill. So, Harpal, whenever you're ready.
00:48:06.250 - 00:48:21.926, Speaker F: Hi, I am Harpal. I will just share my screen now. Hi, everyone. I am Harpal. I'm from Mumbai, India. And for ETH global build quest. I built Nifty Girls.
00:48:21.926 - 00:49:11.034, Speaker F: Nifty Girls is the application where NFDS hang out. So, what is the problem that we are trying to solve? We expect the blockchain applications to be available 24/7, right? But we should also expect our tokenated services to be available twenty four seven. So, discord is right now being majorly used to create token gated communities, but it lacks blockchain level security. Mostly is controlled by roles. So the mechanism is where you connect your wallet to Discord and you are assigned a role which has access to those token gated channels. What is our solution? Our solution is one click connect and access NFT gated chat groups. So all the user has to do is come to our application, connect their wallet, and then they're good to go.
00:49:11.034 - 00:49:46.950, Speaker F: They are given access to all the groups that they should have. No setup is needed, neither from the person who created the NFT collection nor from the user that is joining coming to use the application. All of the data is stored on textile, which is built on IPFS, so data is being stored in a decentralized manner. We also have blockchain level security. Why? Because you are only given access to the groups based on the NFTs you own. There are some alternatives. However, I found a gap where I could build an application which is permissionless and not dependent on Discord.
00:49:46.950 - 00:50:23.890, Speaker F: So let's jump right into the demo. This is how the front page of Nifty Guilds application looks like. All the user has to do is click on Connect Wallet. Once we connect Wallet, right now, what the application is doing is it is trying to get the information regarding all the NFDS in the wallet using Covalent's NFT endpoints. So, as you can see on the left side that I have been assigned or given access to some groups based on the NFTs I hold. One of them is Devs for evolution. I've been given access to this group because I hold a developer, Dao NFT.
00:50:23.890 - 00:51:08.020, Speaker F: You can see we have stats from the NFT collection like floor price, volume, average volume per day, and et cetera. This is done using Covalent's NFT market data APIs. And we also have channels here, different channels that can be created by the fellow members. Remember, you can only get access to these channels if you hold the NFTs in this collection. Now I'm going to try to switch to a different group, Zorbs. Again, I've been given access to this group because I hold a Zorb NFT, and I can also send some messages here to the fellow members in the group. And if I want, I can create more channels here.
00:51:08.020 - 00:51:49.760, Speaker F: Also, one thing to notice is, based on the NFTs you hold on different chains, you can see the logos besides the NFT collection here. So the first six are Ethereum and the last four are Polygon. So basically we support a lot of more chains. Pretty much all the chains that Covalent supports, we support them all. So what is our future plans? We think that we should also implement role assignments. So basically having roles similar to what we have in Discord. And this can be achieved in NFT projects, which are implementing Open Zeppelin's role based access control.
00:51:49.760 - 00:52:23.510, Speaker F: We also think of implementing Composable channel conditions. What this means is letting users create channels just like in Discord, but giving conditions to them. Like if a user wants to access these channels, they need to have two NFTs or special trait NFTs. We plan to also do live peer integration, like we have in Discord for live streams. And we also want to enable direct messaging. Folks here are highly appreciated. Thank you for allowing us to participate in the hackathon.
00:52:23.510 - 00:52:33.530, Speaker F: I learned a lot, and if you're interested in this application and want to check it out, you can go to Niftyguilds Versailles app. Thank you, Karthik.
00:52:34.030 - 00:52:51.090, Speaker A: Thank you so much. This is awesome. Yeah. Especially being able to do more than just chat makes it even more interesting because now the communities can actually manage this without having to be on 500 Discords. So this is great. Well, I hope you continue building this thing, and I hope you try this out for my next Dow community I join.
00:52:51.430 - 00:52:52.194, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:52:52.312 - 00:52:59.560, Speaker A: All right, next up we have NFT Bonfire. So whenever you're ready.
00:53:00.650 - 00:53:19.260, Speaker B: Thank you, Kartik. Two of us are going to make this presentation going. Paul will go and lead us through the slides, and I'm going to present you the live demo. When you feel ready, we can start.
00:53:25.170 - 00:54:01.660, Speaker G: Thanks, Cardik. We are team NFT bonfire. My name is Paul. We have Alenia, Christian and Victor, and we come from all corners of the planet. We see several problems with NFTs. The major one being the perception that basically it's not very good for the environment, but also that a lot of the content there probably shouldn't exist. So we're going to allow you to burn your NFTs and in doing so, you're going to fund climate change because you're going to have to pay.
00:54:01.660 - 00:55:14.874, Speaker G: And we do this through Klima Dow, which is a dao that exists to support climate action through bonding carbon credits. So we're going to build a simple web front end that allows you to go to the website, see the items in your wallet and pick the ones that you want to burn. And when you burn them, you will receive Klema tokens, where one Klema token represents one ton of carbon. But also we're going to give you a nice memorial to your recently demised NFT. So artwork is really important to our project. So we've created some high quality NFTs based on a ghostly theme and they're based on six changeable elements, five variables each, which gives us a collection of 15,000 or so NFTs. And with that, I think it's probably a good time to show you a demo.
00:55:14.874 - 00:55:17.330, Speaker G: So over to you, Ricky.
00:55:18.630 - 00:56:34.580, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Yes, this is going to be our web page where you can see we're going to have two buttons here, which this button is going to remint an old NFT. We have set up a test NFT contract in Openc. So for this test demo, we are going to remint these three NFDS from coming from this right to the left. And then after the transaction will go through, these NFTs are going to diminish and the new ones are going to be created here. Apologies, I cannot click on the sorry, can you tell me how do I get through of this page? Because I cannot click on the web page here because of the zoom.
00:56:35.800 - 00:56:38.724, Speaker A: Can you try dragging that down? I think you may be able to.
00:56:38.762 - 00:57:28.310, Speaker B: Possible to drag down. Oh, yeah, apologies, sorry about that. One more thing before I would like to start with the button. So first I'm just going to reload the page where the MetaMask transaction will pop up. And then after that is done, I just would like to show you because anybody who is going to press this button and remint an actual NFD are going to receive some Klema tokens which going to get from now in this demo, we are going to get it as an ERC 20 and this is going to be our Clima address. And you can see here that we don't have any clima balance right now. So just let's get to the Burn it now button.
00:57:28.310 - 00:58:21.050, Speaker B: We are going to get a screen and as you can see, there is a loop with this mercy button when those three NFT pictures can be seen and just let's burn this one out first. So right now MetaMask would pop up and then just let's click on the confirm once it's done. So just let's now wait for the MetaMask transaction and after that I don't know, sometimes OpenSea is a bit slow but after the transaction, after a minute we should be able to see yes, the transaction has been confirmed. But let's just wait a bit and let's just check whether the MetaMask has already got some klima. Because after the transaction we should be able to get some klima tokens. So if I come back, you can see that we actually own a very little amount of Klima. Right now.
00:58:21.050 - 00:59:13.370, Speaker B: Let's go to OpenSea and see whether this yes, it's already gone through. So as you can see, the edit button has been the NFT has been destroyed and now we are getting the new NFT here, the memorial one. And then in order to see the transaction going to here and see the updatement, we actually have to reload the page. And then as you can see now in the looping, we can see that we are having the new NFT here, which states that this has been successful. So let's remint one more thing just to see. We can remint as many as possible. But of course if you don't want your NFT minted, of course just click on the mercy button and it should be okay.
00:59:13.370 - 00:59:45.090, Speaker B: We have one more thing here because if you click in the enter VR section, you can see actually that we are implementing a metaverse section. But this is very in the early stage now. So this is the further development we are going to go through. So I think that's all for now. So this is for the demonstration. I will give the stuff back to you. Paul and I will get back to the.
00:59:51.140 - 01:00:36.130, Speaker G: So thank you. OK, so just a quick dive into what we have built and how we built it. It's a simple user interface that we are using. Morales behind the scenes we have a single contract at the moment that will probably in the future break into smaller functions. But it orchestrates the whole process of burning the old one, minting the new one. But also we'll go out to a Sushi swap decks and claim some clima tokens that we need to give to the user, give to the person who's just burnt their NFT. But this piece here, the Sushi swap integration, we haven't implemented yet.
01:00:36.130 - 01:01:37.572, Speaker G: So for the future, obviously we have to complete the UI and the contract we need to integrate that decks so that we can actually deliver real Clema tokens. We're going to add the full collection and as you saw briefly, we're going to be continuing looking at 3D options for the metaverse. In fact, we have spoken to one of the other teams who were very interested in allowing us to burn our NFDS within their metaverse. Longer term, we see incentives as really important. So we would like to see Gamification and Tokenomics develop but ideally, it would be great if we can get community gainship engagement and basically wider adoption and ownership of the project. And that's really us. So big.
01:01:37.572 - 01:01:47.610, Speaker G: Thank you to the ETH Global team from all of us. I think we've had a really enjoyable and sometimes stressful time, and yeah, thanks.
01:01:49.100 - 01:02:10.480, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, thank you so much for making a super cool demo and kind of walking us through everything works. This was awesome to see. And for the audience here, there were a bunch of minor issues that came in yesterday around this. May not be able to go work live, but I'm glad that all of you made this happen and nothing went wrong. So this is great, and I hope to see this being used by more projects in the future. So congrats.
01:02:11.300 - 01:02:14.130, Speaker B: Thank you very much, and for the support as well.
01:02:14.500 - 01:02:28.420, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, well, I hope some of you get some sleep in the time zones you're in that I know of. So congrats for presenting. And with that, we are ready for our second, last demo. So without further ado, I'd like to welcome Joan from Shakeshock.
01:02:35.740 - 01:02:37.210, Speaker H: Hey, guys. How are you.
01:02:39.180 - 01:02:39.592, Speaker B: Doing?
01:02:39.646 - 01:02:42.090, Speaker A: Great. Feel free to demo whenever you're ready.
01:02:42.800 - 01:02:43.528, Speaker H: Excellent.
01:02:43.624 - 01:02:44.990, Speaker G: So I'm going to share my screen.
01:02:55.990 - 01:03:35.038, Speaker H: Okay, great. So, yeah, this is Joanne now calling from Paris. We are team Shakeshock, a multiplayer play to earn game inspired by Super Smash Bros. The team is formed by amazing game developers and blockchain developers bitzoic, Gareth KUCO, rodro, and myself. So how Shakeshok? Works pretty much. Shakeshok resembles Super Smash Bros. In the sense that we emulate a battlefield, but we also acknowledge how important it is for players to actually own a character and personalize the character to the level that they want.
01:03:35.038 - 01:04:33.898, Speaker H: So initially, to play the game, you'll need to mint a champion as an NFT. Once you minted the champion, you are airdropped shake token, from which you can buy in game gears, such as a shield sorry, the light goes on sorry. Such as the shield, weapons, et cetera, et cetera, just to get extra points, extra stats for your champion to fight. Then to get into a battle, we make an escrow contract. So you stake your shake token, your in currency token, and then once the battle is over, the escrow is released to the winner, and you are able to evolve your champion either leveling up to level two, three, et cetera, or evolving into a new civilization. So the tech stack, the game has been built using Morales, and we connected sorry, been built with Unity, and we connected with Morales API. We also have deployed it in Polygon.
01:04:33.898 - 01:04:57.480, Speaker H: Contracts have been created with the base of Openzepling, and then we're storing everything using IPFS. So, without further ado, let's get into the demo. So this is, like, the main page. I'm going to connect wallet first. In this demo, I've already minted my.
01:04:59.930 - 01:05:00.774, Speaker B: Sorry.
01:05:00.972 - 01:06:07.206, Speaker H: In this demo, I already minted my player and my armor going to sign now. Great. So this is how it would look like pretty much each player will have their own NFT that they will have their metadata which basically means the stats for the game. So health, armor, jump, power, speed, I hope the whole light, it's not annoying at all speeds. Tokens which basically means it's like the in currency game and dash then you obviously will be able to mint more players if you want, you'll be able to level up so increase your stats and also evolve which basically means that initially you'll have like one civilization. So for instance Romans or Greeks or Persians and then in the future you'll be able to evolve this towards other civilizations if you would like. So pretty much similar to what Game of Empires is also doing whenever you are evolving your civilization.
01:06:07.206 - 01:06:44.278, Speaker H: Here on the left side we can choose different armors. So this is like armors that we have as NFTs. Like all these gears are also NFTs so they are tradable as well and add stats to the player metadata and then we have also different weapons. So once we have decided like no armor, basic Apple for instance, we are now getting into the room settings as well as the escrow contract. So obviously to get in as like we need to kind of input, we need to stake minimum currency. Tokens shake in this case would be the in game currency and then we can also create our own rooms in.
01:06:44.284 - 01:06:45.880, Speaker A: The future as well.
01:06:46.330 - 01:07:29.274, Speaker H: So just for the sake of the demo, I just created a room. This will be myself alone. But pretty much the idea is that you have your own game here. That it's not yet multiplayer, but we're working on this. And then you'll be able to, as you can see here, like dash, move around, jump, et cetera, with your own life. With your own life and kind of like attacking with the different weapons, et cetera, et cetera. So that's for the game, once the game is over, as I said, like you then you are released with the escrow as well as what we're going to walk now through that are the next steps loots.
01:07:29.274 - 01:08:02.786, Speaker H: And so the idea with the loots is kind of like at the end of each match you basically will be able to mint a loot which contains experience points, shake, coins as well as maybe gears. The contracts are already prepared but we need to connect it to the front end that we had the time, enough time. Then later on, we also want to create some like we want to help on the client creations of voting wars, which basically means that in players of the game will be able to decide what civilizations we evolve as.
01:08:02.808 - 01:08:03.202, Speaker B: A game.
01:08:03.256 - 01:08:14.110, Speaker H: And then they will be actually incentivized to either evolve or stay within or either stay within their own evolution and to keep improving their own player.
01:08:14.270 - 01:08:14.546, Speaker B: Right?
01:08:14.568 - 01:08:41.130, Speaker H: So there's some sort of like politics involved and then further down the line as well, like a secondary market for players to sell and exchange. So that will be all. Everything from my presentation, from our presentation. So just please come join us on Discord. I create a very scrappy website, Shakeshock XYZ, that you probably can see it somewhere already. So, yeah, please come join. Happy to have you on board as well.
01:08:41.130 - 01:08:41.820, Speaker H: Thanks.
01:08:42.990 - 01:08:56.590, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much for making that demo. And this is a cool game and such a nice way to think about a 3D version of doing Pde. So I hope you continue. And for everybody who's interested, go to Shakeshock XYZ. Awesome.
01:08:56.740 - 01:08:59.506, Speaker H: Yeah. Thanks, Karti. Thanks a lot for your support as well.
01:08:59.608 - 01:09:06.740, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right. And with that, we are ready for our last demo. So without further ado, let's welcome Jasper to talk about.
01:09:09.030 - 01:10:00.166, Speaker I: Thanks for thanks for having me, Kartik. Really happy to be part of the finalist crew, but want to say congratulations to all the hackers ton of amazing projects out there as part of Build Quest. So for this project, I guess I'm rounding out sort of the 3D experience category and I really wanted to think about how to create different types of metaverse experiences that are kind of nontraditional. So not necessarily purely gaming or video or image based, but actually how the metaverse can influence an industry like music. And so I created this experiment called Metaverse Music, and it allows users to enter songs and create spatial layouts of the different stems of tracks from artists from their songs. So I'll walk through kind of what it looks like from the artist perspective as well as from the user perspective. So first, let's jump in.
01:10:00.166 - 01:10:33.066, Speaker I: Imagine you're an artist and imagine you have the stems of the tracks of your song. So imagine you have the drum track, bass track, vocal track, et cetera. What you can do is you can create a new song to create this metaverse music spatial Audio experience. So to create a song, I have this little form here, and you would first enter some of the basic data about your song. So you put in, let's say, the song title and the song artist. And actually, quite often musicians will release the stems of their songs for part of like, remix competition. So I actually have a track from this band, Felix Cartel.
01:10:33.066 - 01:10:46.574, Speaker I: They're having a competition right now. And so we'll be using that for the demo. Today, you put in a description like, this is a great track. And then what you would do next is you would upload the stems of the song so you can select different types of instruments.
01:10:46.622 - 01:10:46.834, Speaker A: Here.
01:10:46.872 - 01:11:07.642, Speaker I: Let's say you wanted to upload the vocal track. I would just go open this menu and I would, for instance, upload the vocal stem for this song. And behind the scenes it's using a proxy. Server. I've set up to upload things via Pinata and we can see the CID of this track right here. And you would do this for all the different tracks that you have. So let's say we had a drum track as well.
01:11:07.642 - 01:11:37.550, Speaker I: I would upload that basically the same way, so it would upload and then we'd get the CID of this audio file. I'm not going to do that for all the tracks because that's not that exciting. But I currently support up to seven stems for a song. Then you hit this Create Music Experience button and what happens behind the scenes is that we're adding a new entry into a table and table end. We can actually see that new row displayed and populated at the bottom here. So that's how you would create an experience. And now the best part is enjoying the experience.
01:11:37.550 - 01:12:15.854, Speaker I: So for this, we're going to enter the song nothing Good Comes Easy by Felix Cartel. And if you're on a computer, you have access to a VR experience, but if you're on your mobile device, you can actually enter an AR experience as well, which is a bit more fun. But for today, we're just going to do a VR experience so we can see the tracks that are laid out here. I'm actually going to just start playing the song and it should be playing in the background a bit. And we can see there's a vocal track, a drum track, a bass track, a keyboard track and a strings track. I highly recommend testing this experience with speakers, with headphones rather, because that's where you'll have the most spatial effects. I have some presets for arrangements on this side.
01:12:15.854 - 01:12:51.494, Speaker I: So you can imagine mono is actually putting all of the tracks in the center. A stereo configuration would be kind of left and right. And then you can do some fun other ones, like surround sound, where they go all the way 360 degrees around you. And then other ones, like, for instance, a stage that puts them off in the distance. But what's great about this is that a user has the ability to take different tracks and actually arrange them how they like. So, for example, if I wanted to take, let's say, the keyboard track and move them somewhere else, I can actually click and drag and move that, let's say over here. Then I can do the same thing with the different tracks.
01:12:51.494 - 01:13:31.574, Speaker I: Like, let's say I want to move the strings maybe a little bit to this side. And then if the vocals are, for example, too high in the mix, we can do some fun stuff like take them and move them, for instance, all the way over, over here. So now the vocals should be much stronger than the other tracks. And if I leave them over there and we go back to the main mix, you'll see that the mix has changed a lot. And I'm kind of exaggerating this for the demo. But what's really great is you can arrange a track and then actually walk through it and experience different elements of it. You could imagine this, for instance, musicians could recreate and I'm just going to turn the music off here, but musicians could recreate the setups they had for different concerts so you could experience what it's like for that concert.
01:13:31.574 - 01:14:06.660, Speaker I: You could even animate the movement of some of these tracks going forward. You could also do great things like Token Gating, The Experience per track or even things like Async Music already allows you to buy the separate stems of songs. So you could integrate some collaboration with a platform like Async Music as well. This was a lot of fun to build and really just a prototype to show what kind of experiences you could possibly create as part of the Metaverse that are a bit unconventional but had an amazing time. Thanks the ETH Global team, all the judges, sponsors and congrats to all the hackers again. So thanks cardi thanks everyone.
01:14:07.430 - 01:14:35.614, Speaker A: Esper that was absolutely incredible. I mean, we could see the spatial stuff on the VR side I can imagine will be even better and more granular if you were to do this on your phone and with that phone. So this is just super cool. I think just being able to do that for every track, this is a really amazing experience. So I hope you can actually make this self serve and for everybody to use it because this is going to be just a fun thing that we should try at every other place we do and any E Global events we do in the future. So this is just great.
01:14:35.652 - 01:14:36.494, Speaker I: Really appreciate it.
01:14:36.532 - 01:15:14.250, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks again. Absolutely. So thank you so much and congrats to all the teams that just presented.

And a quick note on prize delivery. This is the most common question we get after we announce all the winners. So just as a comment, we'll be connecting directly you directly with all the partners that we're working with for the delivery of the prizes. Some partners have different processes for how they deliver versus kind of how they would like to. So there might be a different set up involved for every project prize you have won. So please be patient.
01:23:23.082 - 01:23:57.846, Speaker A: We'll be able to kind of connect with you with all of them in the next ten or so days. On top of that, we'll be verifying everybody's code base. So please make sure that make sure that you still have your GitHub repos public. You may turn them private after the prize delivery verification has happened. But without verifying that you did indeed work on your project within the period of the hackathon, you will not be able to receive any prize. On top of that, prize delivery is scheduled for the 27th. This gives us enough time to check and correct anything and verify any information we need from any of you or any of our partners.
01:23:57.846 - 01:24:52.742, Speaker A: And for anybody who applied for a pool prize and did not see their names in it. And you would like to understand what happened there, you have 48 hours from now to dispute any pool prize additions, which means that if there's an error in some form, whether it didn't show up or you forgot to click the prize category on the submission form, please notify us in the next 48 hours. After that, we will finalize that list and we will not be able to make any changes. And this is the window we'll be operating in. So once again, congratulations to all 140 teams for kind of putting so much incredible work behind the scenes to make today happen, as well as making the last kind of week really awesome and understanding what everybody's doing. Being able to see everything from your feedback sessions to your showcase to your updates on Discord, it's just made everything extremely wonderful. So we're at the very tail end of concluding this hackathon.
01:24:52.742 - 01:25:46.762, Speaker A: And before we do that, I want to quickly take a couple of minutes and just say a few thank yous to everybody that made this happen behind the scenes, and that's our judges, our mentors, our volunteers, our speakers, and our sponsors without kind of them being also in the back end of making everything work. This would not just be an event that we've built to do easily. This is close to 800 people behind the scenes involved in different capacities, and without everybody's help, these events just don't feel the same, and you don't get to experience it the way you do this time around. So I want to quickly start off by thanking our judges and mentors. All these amazing people took up the time of their day and spent a lot of time anywhere from understanding what teams are doing, giving them feedback, to kind of helping with the judging process and talking to everybody and offering them more recommendations on how to take these projects better. So thank you to all of our judges and mentors. Without your support, this would not be possible.
01:25:46.762 - 01:26:53.226, Speaker A: I want to also thank so many of our amazing speakers who gave talks workshops throughout this two week window, whether it's for the summit or all the workshops that we did, to understand how certain technologies work behind the scenes. Thank you to all of you here. And without all this amazing thing content that you're making it easier for people to learn how these things work, we would not see all these incredible hacks. I also want to quickly thank a lot of our volunteers to sort of help run a lot of these things behind the scenes, especially as you look at judging, where we're judging 500 people at the same time in a two hour window without all these amazing people helping out and making sure everything is on track, we would just not be able to kind of wrap things up in such a small amount of time. So thank you so much to all of you here. And lastly, I want to thank all of our partners who kind of constantly take the time out of their day to make sure that anybody who is trying to understand how to get more involved in this space or use any SDKs or APIs or protocols, they get the help they need. Being able to give feedback, being able to unblock them, being able to answer questions of how something works, even if it's their own product or not their own product, it's just incredibly helpful.
01:26:53.226 - 01:27:35.422, Speaker A: And we're super grateful that we have so many incredible people just hanging on our discord and just helping amazing developers and designers just explore more. So thank you so much for everything that you've done to make this event successful. And there's so many that I need more than one slide to kind of talk about them. And these are all amazing people that we love continuing to work with. And of course, all of you hackers. It is everything that you did that made this event possible all the time. You put in all the time you put in and asking questions, attending talks, workshops, being able to sort of see everything you've done and being able to see all the amazing work you're doing and giving us your time to be part of this event is what makes this event special.
01:27:35.422 - 01:28:22.266, Speaker A: So I'm super glad that we had so many excited people working on so many things that they're excited about as part of Billquest, and we hope to see more of you at our future events as well. And lastly, I want to give a quick shout out to the Ethgobal Team. I want to say quickly thank you to Kevin, Cree, Huichi, Minnie, Anna, Moaz, Luke, Emily, Andrew, Jacob and Liam, who kind of do a lot of work behind the scenes to make this event run smoothly. And that the experience that all of you experience as part of the attendee side is as polished and amazing and high quality as it can be. So thank you so much to the ETH Global Team for making another successful event happen. All right, that's a lot of thank yous. But we had ten teams present today and we called them our finalists.
01:28:22.266 - 01:29:10.266, Speaker A: So the question is, why do we do that? What are they actually winning? We never really talked about that. And if you're attending any global hackathon for the first time, you may not know this, but we call everybody a finalist because we really don't want these events to be a competition. We really want people to sort of try things and experiment. And that's very much the goal of how we think about designing events and how we think about supporting everybody who's participating. So we call them finalists because we really don't want there to be a notion of first, 2nd, third. And when somebody is considered a finalist, they are effectively our first place winners. So all ten of these teams have effectively come out first as part of Billquest, and as part of their prize in being a finalist, the E Global Team will be giving every member that presented today on these ten teams $1,000 each, delivered as USDC.
01:29:10.266 - 01:29:45.254, Speaker A: So congratulations to all of the amazing projects here and all ten of you. And this is in addition to any other partner prize you may have won. And we'll be following up with the details and logistics of all of that with the same timeline, which is late next week, or actually, sorry, the 27 March, to be very specific. So congratulations, everybody. This is very much the conclusion of Billquest. It's been an incredible last two weeks working with all of you. And before we go, this would not be any global event if we don't talk about what's next.
01:29:45.254 - 01:30:46.138, Speaker A: So I am super excited to announce what is up with us in terms of the next thing we're doing, and that is talking about how do we think about building new Web three native social networks. You may have seen this around. This is lens protocol. It's going to be a new way to think about how do we think about social connections and social graphs and just use social tools that are native to Web Three. And as part of this protocol, we are doing our next hackathon that starts this Friday called LF Grow. So we're super excited to see how people build in different ways of thinking about decentralized social networks and all the tools we can do to kind of get anywhere from the benefits of censorship resistance to being able to tap into the same social graph to be able to have composability around different user bases and merging all those experiences together in a more crypto native way. So if you're interested in participating in the next hackathon, please check out LF Grow, which starts in two days and goes for another ten days.
01:30:46.138 - 01:31:19.634, Speaker A: And we want to really see cool, creative things that come out of this thing. So there's already a few hundred people participating and hope to see some of the Billquest hackers. Also, try to explore this event. You can learn more about it by heading over to Lfgrove Ethglobal.com. There's over $200,000 in prizes for this event. We're also going to be giving swag for every hacker, which is physical t shirts. And on top of that, this is just a super new cool protocol that you get to sort of have a front row access to to understand what's possible, understand how it's going, and just really be one of the first users and developers behind this.
01:31:19.634 - 01:31:37.046, Speaker A: So please check LF Grow out and we hope to see a lot of you in the next hackathon as well. And with that, this concludes Billquest. I will sign off and hope you enjoy some lo fi beats. So take care everybody, and see you at LF Grow this Friday. Bye.
