00:00:00.250 - 00:00:19.054, Speaker A: Hi, everybody. So today we're going to talk about integrating with Dapper, the best way to blockchain. So. Hey, I'm Lynn. These are my two little NFTs. I am a developer experience engineer. So essentially I work with Dapper Labs to help developers have a great experience with our products.
00:00:19.054 - 00:01:01.210, Speaker A: I support CryptoKitties, I support Dapper, and today we'll be talking about Dapper. I'll just run through sort of how it works, what it is, and how you can integrate with it to win that bouncy and also for the best blockchain. So what is that for? So we identified a few problems that blockchain technology currently offers in ways to access the blockchain. So we believe in blockchain for all. And one of the things that we saw as a problem was accessing the blockchain. It's hard, it's a lot of steps. And for end users, sometimes those steps are a deterrent to getting on the blockchain and playing games.
00:01:01.210 - 00:02:05.794, Speaker A: We also saw that it's complicated. Users don't know what gas is, they don't know what private keys are, what a seed phrase is, and they just want to play a game. And users don't trust the trustless all the time. What does trustless mean? How is their data protected? How is their information, their NFTs and all those things protected? So we solve those as three different problems that the current way of accessing the blockchain hasn't been addressing with Dapper. Our vision is to access decentralized applications and playing with digital assets is still too much friction. So we want to reduce the barriers to entry to make blockchain easy and accessible to all three of our pillars are easy, safe and connected. So how can we provide users with an experience that's easy, that's safe and that connects them to the blockchain? Our mission then is to give blockchain users the safest and easiest interface to access smart assets, apps and each other in a global and decentralized web.
00:02:05.794 - 00:02:37.438, Speaker A: So what does that mean? We want everyone to get on the blockchain. We want it to be easy, we want it to be safe and we want it to be connected. So what is Dapper? How is Dapper addressing these problems? Dapper makes it simple for users to enter and use the blockchain. How do we do that? So we don't have private keys and we don't have seed phrases. We are a smart contract wallet and we do things a little differently. But it's very simple for users and it provides a beautiful user experience. Dapper can protect users from losing their digital stuff.
00:02:37.438 - 00:03:15.386, Speaker A: They have a recovery kit and they're able to recover their assets and have them with them at all times. And Dapper enables developers to pay for users'network fees so they don't have to worry about it. This is something that we're doing to help save money. So why should you use it? So Dapper is powered by a smart contract. We store assets in a smart contract wallet and we do a little differently. We don't store it on a device like other products. So in this way we're able to have users have complete control over what they own.
00:03:15.386 - 00:04:06.060, Speaker A: We want users to be able to feel like they have their assets, they're able to access them, they're able to join into another game and sort of play and go from there. And we offer a number of account recovery options and easy access on multiple platforms. We offer recovery without having to give up keys. So the way in which we do recovery with Dapper is not to rely on a device or private key. So no more private keys, no more seed phrases. We have a rescue kit that is downloaded and with that rescue kit users can easily recover their wallets and we have adjustable account and security preferences that users can use just by clicking the settings. We're also working on multi send.
00:04:06.060 - 00:05:00.200, Speaker A: This is a feature that is coming soon but multisend will allow users to send multiple transactions in one. So integrating we really want our users to have a very quick and easy experience easy, safe and connected and we want you all to have as you're integrating AC. So integrating with Dapper is very simple. We have two EIPS that we currently follow. Eleven Two is one of the EIPS that we need to have compliance with and this EIP speaks about user approval. So we want users to be able to say hey, when we go to this website you're allowed to access my wallet, my data. Right now that's a little different with other wallets that are on the market and we wanted to address that issue.
00:05:00.200 - 00:05:39.276, Speaker A: So we are EIP Eleven Two compliant and you can learn more about EIP Eleven Two here if you want to take a quick picture. We provide back end sign validation per EIP 1654. So in order to integrate, if you are choosing the path of back end sign validation we have a JavaScript and Go flow that you could use to integrate your back end preference. We also don't insist to use web3 but if you choose to use it you'd need to use version one, point something. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. This is a workshop we're talking about integrating with Dapper.
00:05:39.276 - 00:06:25.556, Speaker A: Welcome, no worries. And here's a bit of information about both EIP 1654 and Eleven Two. So essentially once you've integrated and are compliant with both EIP Eleven Two as well as 1654, you'll be ready to integrate. So that in a nutshell is tapper. I wanted truly to open up the floor to have more questions and sort of what is it, how do we use it, how do we integrate? So I'm happy to kind of go over review. I have both Arthur and Jordan here to answer questions as well. Kind of just wanted to go through here it is and here we are to answer questions about it.
00:06:25.556 - 00:06:32.970, Speaker A: So what questions can I answer for you about a smart contract wallet. Hi, how does the rescue kit work? How does the rescue kit work?
00:06:34.700 - 00:06:42.440, Speaker B: Or is it for if you delete your extension, then you don't have access to the private.
00:06:44.560 - 00:06:45.724, Speaker A: You guys want to feel that?
00:06:45.762 - 00:07:17.380, Speaker C: Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah. So the the rest the way the rescue kit works is it's not part of our regular authorization system. So we have support for multiple devices, which is another kind of cool feature of the smart contract. You can have one address and one set of assets that are owned by that address, but access them through a bunch of different devices and a bunch of different keys. On top of that, there's one special key.
00:07:17.380 - 00:08:13.130, Speaker C: That's the recovery key. And when you perform a recovery through the rescue kit, it will invalidate all your existing devices. So this is the case where you lose them or they become compromised. So it invalidates all your existing devices and then it sets up one new key on one new device and then that's your new key. The only new key going forward that has access to the wallet. And the way that the rescue kit plays into this is we use something called counterfactual recovery. So that recovery key, it's generated when the wallet is created and it signs a transaction and the transaction says to the wallet, it's like, hey, perform a recovery, knock out all the existing devices and create and set this new device as the only one.
00:08:13.130 - 00:09:04.904, Speaker C: But we don't actually submit that transaction, we kind of hold it offline. And in addition to that recovery transaction, which we call it, which is like an ephemeral or counterfactual transaction, we have that key that becomes the new single owner key of the contract, and that is what is stored in the rescue kit. So the users have one side of the puzzle, which is the backup key, which is encoded in the rescue kit and kind of like a friendly PDF format. If you've used one password, it's kind of a similar idea. And then we also have the recovery transaction which is stored on our server, so that when the user requests that we do a recovery for them, we can go through the process because it's a bit of a process. You have to fund the recovery account, send the transaction. A couple of other things similar like.
00:09:04.942 - 00:09:11.960, Speaker D: Nosis, the wallet that you mentioned, you can use different keys from different devices.
00:09:13.100 - 00:09:20.460, Speaker C: Yeah, it is similar. Most smart contract wallets support that. It's one of the benefits of a smart contract wallet.
00:09:22.000 - 00:09:25.500, Speaker B: So if you lose your rescue, then your account will be popular.
00:09:26.340 - 00:10:40.390, Speaker C: Not exactly. So one of the main kind of design axioms that we kept in mind while designing Dapper was we didn't want a single point of failure because with existing typical wallets, you have a key pair, if you lose it, you're done, which is a pretty bad user experience. So we applied that to the standard device keys as well, which I can go into as well. But in the case of recovery, if you compromise, we call it the backup key, which is that key that becomes the new authorized key on the wallet and that's what's stored in the rescue kit. If that gets compromised, then the attacker can't actually do anything with that because it isn't yet an authorized key on the wallet until the recovery transaction is executed. So what you can do at that point is you can, from one of your authorized devices, you can set a new recovery key, go through that whole process, create a new recovery transaction, a new backup key, and then your wallet and your security posture is back into a good state.
00:10:41.480 - 00:10:45.880, Speaker B: Is it mandatory that users have more than one device?
00:10:46.620 - 00:11:12.240, Speaker C: They don't have to, but that in some senses having more than one device kind of mitigates the requirement of having a rescue kit. Because in the same way that if you have one device and you lose it, you can use the rescue kit. If you have two devices and you lose one, you can just use the other device. Right. But the rescue kit is kind of a catch all and also works as a second factor or recovery factor if you only have one device.
00:11:13.860 - 00:11:17.090, Speaker A: Any other questions? What curiosities do you have?
00:11:24.840 - 00:11:26.070, Speaker B: Integrate that?
00:11:28.460 - 00:11:31.050, Speaker C: Sure. Like the 16 four?
00:11:32.080 - 00:11:32.732, Speaker B: Yes.
00:11:32.866 - 00:11:56.860, Speaker C: Yeah. So this is specifically oh, sorry, 16 four is for signing off. Signing up, like verify 1654 yeah. Is signing up to an account by signing a message. Eleven two is asking Adapt or sorry, adapt asking you for permission.
00:11:56.940 - 00:11:57.616, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:57.798 - 00:11:59.684, Speaker C: That's the one you're talking about, right? Yeah.
00:11:59.802 - 00:12:10.390, Speaker A: Okay, so we require it at the front for Adapt to say, can we access your wallet? And then we require that sign just to confirm at the end with 1654.
00:12:11.980 - 00:12:18.650, Speaker B: So like, what was the process of integrating that?
00:12:22.340 - 00:13:28.952, Speaker C: The process of integrating that. So the UI kind of looks like when you go to a news site and they're like, hey, I want to show you notifications, and you say, please don't show me notifications. It's kind of like that. So without eleven two, when your DAP just immediately has access to the Web Three provider, but with eleven two, you have to request access first. So the Web Three provider won't expose any accounts to you, like any account addresses, it'll just expose a way for you to request access to that and then once you've requested it once, then you have access to it for the foreseeable future. It's kind of crazy that we didn't have it before, honestly. You go to any website and they could just immediately track you based on your wallet address and look at how much money you have and what stuff you have, right? Yeah, it is.
00:13:28.952 - 00:13:31.976, Speaker C: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
00:13:32.078 - 00:13:32.730, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:36.290 - 00:13:38.254, Speaker B: Basically I'm going to let you no.
00:13:38.292 - 00:13:40.080, Speaker A: Worries, feel free come on.
00:13:40.450 - 00:13:55.220, Speaker D: Is it like a web3 provider. How do you put I already have my staff that just detects Web Three enable, all the things how do I, how do I add it?
00:13:57.530 - 00:14:03.154, Speaker C: So if you're already set up to work with Web Three, it's like a default.
00:14:03.202 - 00:14:10.940, Speaker D: I mean the guy doesn't have MetaMask or the girl. Should I show Dapper? Is that an option?
00:14:11.630 - 00:14:13.178, Speaker C: Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
00:14:13.264 - 00:14:19.980, Speaker D: So if you don't have MetaMask, I can detest you have Web Three. Can I bring them to Dapper in that case?
00:14:21.810 - 00:14:23.086, Speaker C: Oh, like if they don't have a.
00:14:23.108 - 00:14:28.000, Speaker D: Wallet yeah, I can check window web Three, is it not there?
00:14:31.030 - 00:14:32.130, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:14:33.990 - 00:14:36.050, Speaker D: Is that like a web3 provider.
00:14:37.590 - 00:14:43.060, Speaker C: It exposes a very similar interface to MetaMask. A web3 provider. Yeah.
00:14:45.670 - 00:14:55.158, Speaker E: I said that. The verification code before mobile that won't be in the US don't work.
00:14:55.324 - 00:15:01.622, Speaker C: It doesn't work in the US. Oh, do you tried to my mobile is from Brazil.
00:15:01.766 - 00:15:09.340, Speaker E: I did it in Friday or Saturday in Arianta and don't work. I'm waiting the verification code.
00:15:09.950 - 00:15:13.398, Speaker A: Oh, that's something we are happy to troubleshoot with.
00:15:13.504 - 00:15:15.630, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry about that.
00:15:15.700 - 00:15:18.400, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll definitely catch up with you and troubleshoot through that.
00:15:18.930 - 00:15:22.522, Speaker E: Any other questions, concerns, ideas?
00:15:22.666 - 00:15:23.950, Speaker A: Where's the secret?
00:15:25.250 - 00:15:26.640, Speaker C: Where you want to take it?
00:15:28.710 - 00:15:51.340, Speaker A: At the end of the day, we want to encourage blockchain for all. We want end users to have the easiest and quickest way to get in to the blockchain without a lot of steps, without a lot of going back and forth. Our end goal is to help blockchain to be more accessible to end users and for people to build amazing games and experiences that can be played without a lot of questions.
00:15:52.750 - 00:15:53.370, Speaker C: Hi guys.
00:15:53.440 - 00:15:53.834, Speaker E: Hi there.
00:15:53.872 - 00:15:55.260, Speaker A: Welcome. Come on in.
00:15:56.670 - 00:16:01.642, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, that was my bad. I had the wrong room.
00:16:01.776 - 00:16:03.514, Speaker A: No worries. Hi.
00:16:03.712 - 00:16:09.678, Speaker B: I kind of want to repeat this question a little bit just to make sure that I and everybody understand.
00:16:09.844 - 00:16:10.560, Speaker A: Yes.
00:16:11.170 - 00:16:29.400, Speaker B: If I have a DAP right now that already has MetaMask, it works with MetaMask, right? What do I have to do in order to use Zapper? Do I just replace it if somebody do I have to change my Dapper if I'm only using three.
00:16:32.010 - 00:16:32.870, Speaker A: Enable?
00:16:35.210 - 00:16:44.666, Speaker C: You don't. Besides those two things that we mentioned and they don't 1654 at least doesn't apply to every DAP. You don't have to do anything else.
00:16:44.768 - 00:16:45.660, Speaker A: There you go.
00:16:49.490 - 00:16:52.074, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry. Maybe we should maybe we should go back to that slide.
00:16:52.122 - 00:17:40.960, Speaker A: Yes, we should, but I can't get it's no working in just a second we'll tell you about them. But essentially we look for EIP eleven two and 1654 compliant. So if you are compliant with the windows that enabled at Ethereum, requiring user approval in the beginning and providing a back end sign validation via either JavaScript or Go on the other side, then you'll be integrated. And did you want to go in more detail or this is not coming up at all.
00:17:43.670 - 00:17:58.822, Speaker C: Eleven two is pretty straightforward, 1654 is slightly more complex, but it only applies if you are creating an account based on somebody signing a message, which not every DAP does.
00:17:58.956 - 00:17:59.590, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:59.740 - 00:18:05.302, Speaker C: But yeah, we're happy to go over either of those. Oh, nice.
00:18:05.356 - 00:18:06.360, Speaker A: There it is.
00:18:08.270 - 00:18:23.962, Speaker C: Yeah, you can grab any of us, or Arthur if you do need 1654, yeah, just grab us and we can help you figure that out. Or eleven two more than happy to.
00:18:24.016 - 00:18:48.040, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll be here all weekend and we're here to cheer you guys on, to help you with your integrations and that sort of thing. So if in fact you are interested in Dapper and wanting to learn more about how you can integrate with your DAP to provide your users with the best, easiest and quickest experience on the blockchain, then we will be walking around all weekend. So please feel free to find us. Feel free to connect with us if you tried out. Would you like to speak about bounty information?
00:18:49.290 - 00:18:50.760, Speaker C: Do you have the.
00:18:52.890 - 00:18:53.778, Speaker B: Slide?
00:18:53.954 - 00:18:59.206, Speaker C: You don't? I don't know the we have a.
00:18:59.228 - 00:19:42.576, Speaker A: Dope bounty, you guys should check it out. And we sent an email with our Dapper developer kit that goes over both the bounty. We provide a staging build for you all to try out Dapper interface and you can get information on the bounty, a hack, documentation, and more information about how we do what we do in the back end of Dapper. Any other questions that you guys have curiosities, anything like that? The email came to the email list of those who are hacking. Yeah, and we're happy to provide information. If you just come to our booth, we can help you out as well. No worries, I'm happy to.
00:19:42.576 - 00:19:49.890, Speaker A: If you can come to our booth, we can send you out an email. Any other questions? Guys?
00:19:52.820 - 00:20:04.140, Speaker D: We hope you're enjoying deborah was the one.
00:20:07.630 - 00:20:19.062, Speaker A: Come tapu, we're happy to help. All right, well, thank you for your time, we'll be here all weekend. We appreciate it.
00:20:19.196 - 00:20:49.238, Speaker C: Before everybody goes, I'm going to quickly plug my own talk which is happening tomorrow. I'm going to go into all the technical details of the smart contract, so if that interests you at all, it's at 430, I believe, but you can check the schedule. 430 and andromeda which I think is the room right over there. Yeah. So feel free to yeah, sure, go ahead.
00:20:49.324 - 00:20:50.200, Speaker A: No, please.
00:20:51.950 - 00:20:52.906, Speaker B: No, I was just going to say.
00:20:52.928 - 00:21:28.180, Speaker F: That we have a bounty, so if you would like to integrate with Dapper, it's really straightforward. Like Jordan was saying, for many DApps, there's nothing different you have to do. But if you use it in your demo, we are having a bounty for the first place, we're judging, and we're giving $1,500 for the winner of that category. So it's really not a lot of work, and it gives a better user experience for every user that tries your DAP. So yeah, do that.
00:21:29.590 - 00:21:30.820, Speaker A: Thank you, guys.
