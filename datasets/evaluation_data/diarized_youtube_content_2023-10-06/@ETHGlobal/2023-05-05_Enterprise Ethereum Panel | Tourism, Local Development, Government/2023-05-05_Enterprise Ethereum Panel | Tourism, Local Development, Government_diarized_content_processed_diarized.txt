00:03:43.292 - 00:03:44.630, Speaker F: And they wrote on the kara.
00:03:46.430 - 00:03:46.746, Speaker C: It.
00:03:46.768 - 00:04:55.740, Speaker F: Is and whatever they wrote to me and Okira, but from on the scared domo and my shatoshi show satoka and otherwise so you could and descare it and mashtayoni and sabijo scrutino. Hashi can I know there and Omanakano Macreate Mascara and whatever you Kasha Sanga and Guru Nagade and whatever engineer and.
00:05:48.070 - 00:05:51.300, Speaker A: About similar.
00:05:53.990 - 00:05:54.740, Speaker D: To.
00:06:01.910 - 00:06:19.194, Speaker C: I would like to take the lead. My name is Kawasaki on this session and I would like to go back to the introduction from Japan Airlines and Hakodo, you said that you're now engaged, both of you, in a partnership for the sort of a public NFT. So can you describe slightly in terms of the slang that you prepared for us today?
00:06:19.392 - 00:06:30.010, Speaker B: Hi ano Taskara Sushra projectoa eto ibaru ano chicken.
00:06:37.310 - 00:06:55.010, Speaker C: Projecto an INFT endeavorment is really utilizing the asset of the regions around Japan and in order to establish a value for each of the relationships and the value for the local tourism industry.
00:07:03.070 - 00:07:25.918, Speaker B: Napa kibi chikino fangi no ano kunkiki sachi no koano casse product and of.
00:07:25.924 - 00:08:40.162, Speaker C: Course, in Japan we are seeing a dropping of the birth rate and the demographics is shrinking. And of course, especially that is evident in the regional suburban areas of Japan. So utilizing NFDA, we're going to create the fans of these community. So this is not only in Japan but also overseas as well that we're going to create a set of touch point of the relationship building so that we will be able to lure people to these locations in order to revitalize them. And we have two NFD projects that we are running as of now. And this is the one, the first one, this is in Kagoshima Prefecture. It's called Amami and they are quite famous for producing black sugars.
00:08:40.162 - 00:08:57.020, Speaker C: So black sugars are utilized for shochu. It's kind of a distilled alcohol and this owner of the black sugar shochu we are offering NFT and we are seeing how this could be involved in the maturity of this shochu as well. In holding the right.
00:09:08.550 - 00:09:25.140, Speaker A: Hannah pointed at so so Brook chain no you say to you must.
00:09:29.510 - 00:09:57.310, Speaker C: And it's a big, I think endeavorment for both companies in order to try to offer the public NFTs and you also talked about the notion of relationship population based on relationship. That is not only a one time visitor, but you're going to establish relationship with that person. So there's going to be a long term sort of relationship with that individual. So can you talk to the notion of how blockchain or technology is utilized in order to create the scheme altogether?
00:10:01.410 - 00:10:46.650, Speaker B: Point of you, Noah? No community don't know I show Kanati mote orimasio there sono do you tune so teshotoa tata Tabino maya toka Tabino atotoka and so Yuri sona I the okinatoimas day chikino nitai so I so you know Kamaru Jana.
00:10:52.710 - 00:11:46.654, Speaker C: And of course, the reason why we utilize NFT I mentioned about the community. And there needs to be a sense of belonging in the community, affection towards the community. And of course, for one person to feel attachment to a certain location or certain product, you need to have a reason why that person has an attachment. It's not just a one time tourist, but for the people to return and establish relationship, it should be the people living in those regions or maybe the asset that belongs to that region. So I think creating bondage between people is very important. So pre visit and after visit, pre and post, there needs to be a sense of relationship and bondage that leads to affection building of that community. So we run this POC and we believe that the love or affection to that region is greatly influenced by these relationship and bondage.
00:11:46.654 - 00:11:53.700, Speaker C: So that is the reason why we decided to utilize a means of NFT. So NFD is a technological means for us to realize that.
00:12:02.790 - 00:12:07.290, Speaker A: So jimotono shoko kano katanatari Komino Katata.
00:12:20.830 - 00:13:15.498, Speaker C: And I have question to I have a question to Kisisan in terms of I myself being a part of the Setagaya Award, it's very difficult for the members of the Chambers of Commerce and also the client to understand the notion of NFT and blockchain. It's far too difficult. But how do you evolve people on this initiative? The first answer is not easy to evolve involving people all it's hard. And in terms of the important partner for this POC that we have executed is the local municipal sort of government. At the same time, the local business.
00:13:15.584 - 00:13:29.330, Speaker D: Owners, the Jibanoki a Cogamat Brokechen, Kanchimo Merini.
00:13:33.510 - 00:13:56.620, Speaker C: And the members of the local business community, they are now sensing a sense of urgency at the moment because it's very hard to find a successor of their business and the region is depopulized, the population is dropping depopulation. So therefore, they have a sense of urgency and they would like to step in and embrace blockchain if that will help them going forward.
00:14:08.550 - 00:14:44.726, Speaker D: And naganaka etomaskasimona shoshatokini naganaka sono chiki Kaseka Chono jinko FIA sheikhada mote iruga itzka darikaga nanka destarde Tabuya master Sushara jarusan hakodo anga namokia tomoimas.
00:14:44.918 - 00:15:48.834, Speaker C: And in terms of that sort of energy coming from the local companies, the vice versa, the local municipal government I'm sorry if the representative of the local municipal government here with us today, but this does not apply to every local government. But I think the notion is that in terms of blockchain and digital technology, the literacy is not there yet. And of course, the region, faced with the reduction of the population depopulization and also the activities now have shrunken, and they know they have to do something about it. But they're feeling that someday from somewhere, there will be a severe that will come to us and help us in solving this problem by digital means. Okay, so Japan and Ally Hakodo, you are here also you're going to be helping us. So that's the kind of stance from the local government. So there's a tremendous amount of big gap this time.
00:15:48.834 - 00:15:57.780, Speaker C: The project that we're learning is Amami and Mie and both of them is not a typical stereotype sort of a municipal government that I've described. It's all different.
00:16:12.230 - 00:16:24.586, Speaker A: As I say, Kai and I got.
00:16:24.608 - 00:16:25.500, Speaker D: You know, the sun.
00:16:28.910 - 00:17:37.486, Speaker C: Thank you very much for sharing your story about the local government. But I think in the central government there's a tremendous interest and hype around Web Three. The other day the LDP Liberal Democratic Party have compiled a Web Three sort of a guidelines report and that also would imply about the new taxation scheme that they have revised. And of course today there are a lot of people from overseas participant and I'm sure that all the situations are different. But I think gradually the notion of Web Three is evolving overall in the government and the public sectors as well. So having said that, I think in last December the Digital Agency of Japan has compiled a Web Three report and it was full of content. It was a very thorough report that in a timely manner was published by the agency.
00:17:37.486 - 00:18:53.126, Speaker C: And we have today two people who are involved from the government side in order to evolve this effort. So I know the whole scheme is very, very grandeur and not something that could fit into this time. But if both of you will be able to explain about how this is undertaken on the public side, I would appreciate that. First of all, from Nozaki san, if you can share your insights first. So last April, the Delhi Democratic Party have issued a white paper. And to say that Japan, as a nation, is going to stand on the firm foundation of Web Three and receiving that message that the government has stipulated. That we are going to try to resort to the sound web three development and how we are going to prepare the environment, the externalities in order to try to develop and evolve.
00:18:53.126 - 00:18:56.380, Speaker C: Web Three was the hot talk at that time.
00:19:00.910 - 00:19:22.770, Speaker E: Show tokatasna Shakaikai put the ano is in the session some other mano destination SA State tari Disney anokaise Sashi.
00:19:24.550 - 00:19:50.250, Speaker C: Mashed Up and we also have discussed as being mentioned already about the dropping population in the regional communities and there are a lot of social issues that confront this region. But we have come to say that there's a lot of promising new ideas coming from the world of Web Three as we have all heard today. So we said that we are going to try to develop and promote and improve this Web Three technology here in Japan.
00:19:57.990 - 00:20:13.330, Speaker E: Naikos Nagarikato ATO Makaminikonga Kukai Monday oh koton don kaikito, you know, kano say oh mase.
00:20:15.430 - 00:21:08.198, Speaker C: And the Web three technology enabled us to create an incentive in order to get connection and touch point with each individual at different people on a people to people level. And so that's the benefit of the attribute of this technology and also the community setup. It's easy to set up or it's an effective means to set up the economy so that in itself we believe is going to solve a lot of social issues that we confront today. So I believe there's a tremendous amount of possibility in this technology. So Kalagi Sang they're very much deeply involved in this session and study group. So if there's anything that you would like to highlight in all the items that are being covered or compiled in the report, I would like to hear that from you.
00:21:08.364 - 00:21:10.790, Speaker F: Hi Anukanatomotima.
00:21:14.590 - 00:21:17.814, Speaker C: I think there are two. One is the wide realm of coverage.
00:21:17.862 - 00:21:43.170, Speaker F: Of the themes hi Ano kabarata tiger Nakte dao toka di toka and and you funny hatting.
00:21:45.030 - 00:21:46.050, Speaker E: Descades.
00:21:54.010 - 00:22:46.180, Speaker C: What I mean by coverage is the subject of the researches that has been conducted in Web Three. There's whole different disciplines that has been covered in the report. There was not only NFT as a digital sort of technology but also stepping into the area of Dao and also a distributed automated organization and ID. So this I think was a tremendously a large scope or large sort of a broad spectrum that needs to be dealt with and I felt a tremendous amount of motivation in covering all these areas. And the second is the amount of energy that are exerted in this effort, especially from the policymaker side or regulatory establishing side.
00:22:48.950 - 00:24:10.210, Speaker F: Making the kuranai to andoskataranai put a kuruma hashirikoto kachiko okitamo matamazi no the sugo sono Mitchots kurukotona Yoni Do Yona and Masaya Komoki with The Kashkuti and Makan Kingakano Gidono Dichotina they and Tama Nakati and Onai ona and So Nagakuna and Akumadeko Titokini Minagarati Kobaran so Hontoni and Okora Kikana Mahoko itankoda mentor metatron.
00:24:16.390 - 00:25:00.670, Speaker C: Of course, in terms of the policymakers or rulemaking side. I alluded to a metaphor of road and vehicle when I was introducing myself, which was not translated. I'm sorry. And we are in a way of responsible with the government to create the infrastructure or the road for the vehicles which is items or product or services, what have you, utilizing NFT to run smoothly on this infrastructure. So we are responsible for the creation of the road in itself but if there's no vehicle, what's the point of making the road or infrastructure to start off with. So that should be well considered. And also if we are going to create a road infrastructure we need to make sure that there's not going to be any congestion or accident between the vehicles as well.
00:25:00.670 - 00:25:43.370, Speaker C: So there needs to be a good balance of these two notions of the aspect. And of course it has been talked about by Iwanata san that the profit that's been generated with the owner of the asset and how that could be redistributed. There is an issue of secretization and there is an issue of legal barrier that prohibits us from utilizing that scheme here in Japan. So I think by having this report being compiled, we had all the experts and professionals gathering every week by week and we have a very hot heated discussion how we need to go about in the future. But I think in a nutshell, in creating the report there was a lot of learning that we need to be well balanced in seeing the both side of the world in the rulemaking.
00:25:47.790 - 00:26:33.450, Speaker A: It's koshaka no you say no Kataka you know the and of that. So and comment to it that I tell which is and shimmer you know to you for your moon to skill the more and Snay and hokok shannon but also mita and mono k I should know. So you are verifiable credential to say the snake and hakosi. There god taking. I come in and tell them. But snares on what you know. So yeah.
00:26:33.450 - 00:26:48.770, Speaker A: So and it's neck. But jacob more. So no IMA safeguardo god. So Hanson, Jana, Kati, Hamokato, Hank and Safe.
00:26:59.930 - 00:28:09.342, Speaker C: So I have two questions since the members of the government or administration is here with us, this is a question, two question I would like to ask and then afterwards I would like to have the rest of the panel comment on the session and then she's on to close the session. So the two question I have is that in terms of number one relevancy with a so called my number card, this is like a social insurance card that the government is promoting for all of the residents and civilians to have, but the so called verifiable credential. And what are you going to consider about the verifiable credential with the fact that let's say in the web three, the anonymous of course nature of web three in form of a wallet have a lot of benefit because it's anonymous. But at the same time you need to have a verifiable credential that needs to link back with this. So what is your consideration on this issue? And the other is that support of the government. I think the web three has image of being anti establishment or against those sort of rigid or robust sort of approach. So there is a conflict maybe in between those two.
00:28:09.342 - 00:28:22.180, Speaker C: So being the government it's contradictory and oxymoron that they are pursuing this web three which is kind of totally different from their world what is the government stance on this? So these are the two questions.
00:28:42.790 - 00:28:44.700, Speaker E: My Ionakoto technology.
00:28:50.270 - 00:29:07.210, Speaker C: So two question I think are interrelated contextually. So I would like to ask answering by one aspect, excuse me? And of course, in terms of the web three, the fact that it is an anonymous world. That is a benefit. So that is the reason why people can be connected and they could be incentivized.
00:29:07.630 - 00:29:10.546, Speaker E: They must. The ko safegado. Kakawa take no.
00:29:10.568 - 00:29:11.106, Speaker C: Kato. You.
00:29:11.128 - 00:29:30.850, Speaker E: Koto desktop identity to Kawarato. Nitsuite Masa national Torast Ankatosna and do you acquire Hatai Kanato?
00:29:31.830 - 00:30:11.090, Speaker C: And in specific to the first question how government is related identity and wallet there is also a tremendous amount of trust that is associated with these two technology and idea so for the government, it's a national trust anchor in order to utilize this technology that's number one. So with that in terms of Social Security number my number card how are you going to create that? In terms of digital authentication system is one thing that the governor need to tackle.
00:30:15.670 - 00:31:05.330, Speaker E: My song community to you to go naki mose community in a stakehold for that you know not the degradation sector to Steva so much more Sonot sky type business NIZO do hori okoshiko karama katika because I must see at academia sector you don't take any kotoga.
00:31:07.930 - 00:31:49.310, Speaker C: And the second question that is in terms of distributed nature of that technology as for the government. I think it's important that we are not anti or against this liberal technology, but rather we are part of the community. We are one of the community. And being the government as being the one of the community I think we need to be held accountable for, like the other stakeholders in the same way. And each one would have a role to play in that community. So in this case, the government will be responsible for solving the regulatory issues and reviewing the regulatory requirement. And the other is the private sector, the business sector.
00:31:49.310 - 00:32:34.370, Speaker C: There is a tremendous amount of need to discover and unravel the possibility of the technology which leads back to the business model, new business model. And the members of the academia, they need to work on the encryption technology. And how safely would we be able to utilize the technology? So the three parties all have their role to play. And I think that the name of the game is in order to have that Tripod type collaboration moving forward in solving this issue and in order to achieve a success in the multistakeholder community. There are two things that we advocate.
00:32:38.310 - 00:32:52.740, Speaker E: Governance Initiative Network Chain or Megurd. Some of them are shokada. And it's it.
00:33:02.190 - 00:33:43.850, Speaker C: And one is the initiative called Blockchain Governance initiative network. Excuse me, BGIN. And this has already been established around the world. So It's online way of how we are going to communicate and involve not only us, the government, but also the academia. So there's already a place for us to have a discussion and engage in a discussion so anyone will be able to participate if you wish. So I hope that you'll be able to take part in the stock of Begin BGIN initiative to contribute your insights. It's.
00:33:48.990 - 00:33:58.890, Speaker E: Bash community otscata Destiny Communications.
00:34:01.890 - 00:34:12.980, Speaker C: And the second initiative in the Web Three we have a working group that established a dow community and at the moment it's only Japanese, but this sizing community is working very well for the promotion of this technology.
00:34:18.150 - 00:34:34.010, Speaker A: Complicated or mascara demo decision.
00:34:57.990 - 00:35:07.890, Speaker F: Ironico do and oka market to, you know, tanga kadaga.
00:35:16.070 - 00:36:34.750, Speaker C: And just very shortly, I would like to add on the discussion just now, I know time is running out, but in terms of blockchain in the past, it sort of was an attitude of product out and there is a big theme and the theme maker is creating a hype and try to attract people. But now I think the community and the society have come to understand the situation I can market in. I think that is an important approach publishing structure scheme of its own and I think it's quite a unique compared to the other part of the world where I talk with the colleagues of Deroit. That is quite a unique standing country and there is a full fledged promotion and also enhancement from the government side to promote the technology. So I think there's a lot of expectation that we will be able to foresee in the coming futures.
00:36:37.010 - 00:36:42.370, Speaker D: Hi eto hondo sakyoto skinx no shatta Najimi.
00:36:45.510 - 00:36:55.220, Speaker C: In this regard, of course Hatasan from Scranix talked about the familiarity and I also would like to expand on this but.
00:37:00.230 - 00:37:11.050, Speaker D: More tokume say to a nandrosenska monda gastakushanoir.
00:37:14.670 - 00:37:23.440, Speaker C: So in terms of the anonymous nature of technology web Three, what really was a hurdle or hindrance for us was.
00:37:28.450 - 00:37:32.270, Speaker D: Digital Jumi master.
00:37:38.690 - 00:37:53.266, Speaker C: And we approached the public sort of sector for public NFT. The first of course, the entry point was to discuss about the digital registry and the second was to promote the tourism industry for that region.
00:37:53.378 - 00:38:18.460, Speaker D: Hi digital jimmy Sango shatti Konkai kono Nuftskata community oscar Mojo show me the ARTO yutokoro there kankaging Coco N-F-T dato Amami N-F-T there Kutojo Chi o tomura Sun Name.
00:38:31.430 - 00:39:10.654, Speaker C: And also it goes back to the community that Takahaja san talked about. And this also have a great relevance to the digital registry that I mentioned. Because if you are going to take part in the buy, the NFT that we offer, such as the Amami NFT that has to do with the black sugar Choju, after three years, when the Choju is distilled, you're going to get the final product. But in the meantime, you are asked to come to Amami for several times to see how the distilling processes are taking place. So during that time frame you come to love the location amami and after three years, you're going to be certified as a Amami resident. So you're going to get the registry.
00:39:10.702 - 00:40:04.610, Speaker D: In other words, TADA eto Korea. My number to do sonogamanamari gusha karandi deskir. The more kangobu miyakurato dondo tito you go to the chitaiga Moguru jimijo destamitanamono katakatanimota. Show me the ARU dakarakoso NFT to a Kokotashi mask.
00:40:07.670 - 00:41:04.478, Speaker C: Then, of course, if you are told to talk about the technology technology utilization in the digital registry, there's a whole realm of concern. So what are you going to do in getting the administrative government service? What's the implication of the tax that you need to pay? What about the social insurance numbers? So that is going to involve a whole different set of department and division within the municipality. And that is going to be a fact of reason why the local government would hesitate in introducing digital technology. But we started off from the edge or from the facet of promoting tourism. And that's much easier, and that's much easier for the people to understand. Okay, if you're going to invite a lot of tourists and we're going to make the CTO government lucrative, why don't we do that? So then the real objective but is for us to create a sort of a digital passport, a single source of truth for that individual. And that is the reason why we wanted to introduce NFT.
00:41:04.478 - 00:41:14.300, Speaker C: But it was difficult. So we started off with the tourism discipline or facet in entering into this realm of effort. It.
00:41:19.300 - 00:42:24.880, Speaker B: Saigoniano Nitash Masga I know Nfdoka. I know Hanashi dose and a Konkai torikunda projection toka nakasoita challenge guy digital mother kadai datuka music. And so you. But challenge, you know imikito.
00:42:30.040 - 00:43:12.690, Speaker C: I would like to short in my comment and in terms of when we talk about digital, it seems as though that it's confined in sort of a digital space about NFD and world three, that's most of the people's impression about technology, but in fact, that's not the case. There is actual physical place and physical community and there's so much things that technology can do in bringing value to these physical location and physical people to people relationship. So when you talk about digital is anonymous and how this could be translated into real physical world, we still do not know yet. We don't have the full answer. But we wanted to challenge and we wanted to try this out and see how it rolled out. So that is the reason why we were engaged in this project.
00:43:13.300 - 00:43:50.720, Speaker E: Hi eto de master manania kurioiki fiaste Masono mason doya marito fiesta Ikuto height it's no manica nanika sono jamie no idea naru budonga maso you buddha hype.
00:43:55.860 - 00:44:24.810, Speaker C: And so I think the whole notion that common thread that was discussed among the team was how Dao could be evolved in utilization of the very different means. And I think there's a whole lot of things that Dao can do and still it is unknown something that could be decided something could not. But I think there's a whole big opportunity. So again, in terms of leading that back to the digital registry. ID. So I think that could conclude the overall session for this time. Thank you.
00:44:24.810 - 00:44:27.464, Speaker C: Hi.
