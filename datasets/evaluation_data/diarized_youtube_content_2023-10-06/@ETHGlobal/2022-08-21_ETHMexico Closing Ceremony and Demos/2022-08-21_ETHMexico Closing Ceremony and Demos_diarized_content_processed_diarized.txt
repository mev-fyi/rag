00:13:55.830 - 00:15:32.374, Speaker A: Are you all excited? All right, welcome to the Eve Mexico finale, everybody. Buddy. How's everybody doing? All right, well, we're going to kick it off with a nice summary of how the last 36 hours were. All right, well, welcome everybody. I'm Kartik, one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I am super excited to put this event at a close for the next 2 hours, we're going to have an amazing time. So all of you have been working on amazing projects for the last two and a half days. And I know a lot of you are super tired.
00:15:32.374 - 00:16:06.978, Speaker A: We're going to make sure everything is as quick as possible. But for those of you who are joining us for the first time, especially on the live stream, to summarize, this has been an incredible event. We have 580 people from 27 different countries coming here, and they are half of them are new to Web Three. They made some incredible projects, impressed our judges so much that we had to change up how we format the rest of the event, and we're going to talk about that in a second. On top of that, 65% of them were from Latin America. This has been our most local event ever, and we have 92 projects that came out of it. This blew our minds and exceeded all expectations.
00:16:06.978 - 00:16:59.682, Speaker A: And with these 92 projects, we spent the last 4 hours going through all of them and judged and saw what they did. And I want to thank all of our amazing judges for putting in all the hard work and giving the feedback. So please give a big round of applause to all of our judges. Paris Tani Skyler chris Baron, shannon Evan aya Sean chris Evan and Chewy. They talked to all of these projects, gave amazing feedback, and on top of that, you also presented to some of our incredible partners for all the prizes that you're giving. So I want to also give a big shout out to all of these partners. Avi Grantstow dYdX IPFS Filecoin Lens Protocol Polygon Wide Connect WorldCoin Mina Superflow at the Graph Abacus chainlink Gnosis Chain coinspec Espasio Crypto and rabbit hole we're going to talk about all of these winners soon, but let's get back to the projects.
00:16:59.682 - 00:17:28.446, Speaker A: As we started at the beginning of Friday, this is not a conference. We care about building cool things. The focus is to show and not tell. And from these 92 submissions, we got twelve incredible finalists, and they're all going to be coming on here and showcasing what they built. So I want to give a big round of applause to Data Morpho, KP, kiwi Sellout, emergence stacks, block community eatpoint spiritus ethereum, montessors, United and Rouge. They are all twelve incredible teams. We're going to bring them on one by one.
00:17:28.446 - 00:17:51.462, Speaker A: You're going to see twelve incredible demos live of what they built. And we're going to have Vitalik do his talk. And then we're going to talk about all the prizes that everybody's won. So stay patient for the next 2 hours. And before we go into the first demo, I want to take a quick second to thank all of these 80 amazing projects that took all this time to make something really cool. That's when they were really proud of. You did an amazing job.
00:17:51.462 - 00:18:15.710, Speaker A: So many of you were new, so many of you learned about so many new technologies. The fact that you presented, the fact that you submitted is awesome. And you should be proud of that and really hope that you continue working on them tomorrow onwards. Take some time off today. And for those of you who want to look at all these projects, you can head over to Ethcopal.com showcase and see the list of all 92 of these projects. From the demo videos, to screenshots, to descriptions, to the live websites.
00:18:15.710 - 00:18:47.210, Speaker A: All of this thing is here. And with that, let's go into our very first demo. Who is excited? All right, well, let's bring on Data Morpho for our very first team. They'll get set up here and on deck will be KP and we'll get them set up in a few minutes. So please give a big round of applause to Data Morpho. It look up there. Thanks.
00:18:47.210 - 00:19:25.070, Speaker A: You go to the place. Okay. Hello everybody. We're really proud to be here and being able to kick this off. So we are metamorpho, conformed by Herman Benson Ben and I'm Eduardo. And what is Data morpho? Just imagine millions of years of Data Morphosis files that can survive generations. We're tired of these NFT collections fixing rarity to their convenience.
00:19:25.070 - 00:19:59.298, Speaker A: Yes, I mean, everybody here minted one time and have a pre revealed period. Well, you know what is going to happen with my NFT? And then at the end, you know that sometimes someone came and give the golden penguin to their friends. And then you got the shitty NFT that don't worth nothing. So this can happen anymore. We want to make Mins reliable. Okay, so Data Morpho is a new file standard? Yes. Now we have standard files that are static files, or maybe some file that is injected with code or algorithm that gives a different output.
00:19:59.298 - 00:20:15.422, Speaker A: But we don't have files that can change the content by itself. So what we are going to do here is no more or. This is your NFT, an example for a use case. And close your eyes. And now you have this paper. Congratulations. This is technology.
00:20:15.422 - 00:20:37.902, Speaker A: No Blockchain is about a lot of technology. Many very smart people making syntact are incredible. So this kind of behavior on the programming is an insult. No more file substitution and impossible to pick. Finger your railroad with logical programmer Data Morphosis files. Okay, let's get technical. Meet the metamorpho ecosystem.
00:20:37.902 - 00:21:16.554, Speaker A: How does this work? Let's be quick. This is a file on IPFS for verification and validification. This is what we usually find in a file. But now we have some encrypted and obfuscated data. Here we have an isolated security key storage that through some triggers that can be dates on Oracle saying the weather or some match results gives the keyer put in any web3 data storage service that is full accessibility by anyone. So here our little muffer is enjoying the content. Okay, this sounds interesting, can you take me a little bit deeper on this? How does it work? Okay, this is the structure of GPEG.
00:21:16.554 - 00:21:44.970, Speaker A: In example we have the first hex byte the content, then we have the comment area and then the file after here we have some obfuscated content and the GPS encrypted there we have there some very crucial information to get the decryption. We have the triggers that are going to be published and we have in the file the strictly necessary data to access to the right content on the storage service. Okay, so is this a new file extension?
00:21:45.470 - 00:21:46.026, Speaker B: No.
00:21:46.128 - 00:22:42.662, Speaker A: Is this a new file format? No, this is fully compatible with any of the files that we currently use because after the end of files almost all of the viewers are not going to looking for something. So we are going to use but when there is the implementation now we are going to find that the content area that is going to be triggered many times in example in Christmas dia de Mortos or when somebody has a mustache, we will have a different thing over there. So one use case, I want to mention an example, madonna is going to release a song and you get the NFT. You get a song that is Madonna saying I'm going to sing, I'm going to sing. But then on the day that corresponds this MF three file data morphosis and now you have the song and you are the first listening to it. Okay, so what can we expect from this? Trust. How we love IPFS.
00:22:42.662 - 00:23:13.062, Speaker A: Trust data morpher reveal, post reveal in the same file that you own from the very first time. Trust and a future thing that is already done here in example license and content. So is trust. Okay? So in terms of adoption, we need NFT collections to start using this technology so that they build trust and liability on their project. So we got started with NFTs. We have a fully functional proof of concept. It's minimal, but I will demonstrate it to you.
00:23:13.062 - 00:23:55.790, Speaker A: We started minting an NFT. This is our NFT and it's displayed in OpenSea. The baseline is the fully metadata standards of OpenSea but we added something so you might rec. It's not very visible, but we added secret encrypted information that we stack in the NFT. If you try to open it, you get something like this, which is not very useful, but we created a new interface. This is extremely minimal, but pretend it's a new openc it's full functional. Full functional.
00:23:55.790 - 00:24:45.822, Speaker A: So here is our NFD the same as in OpenSea. But there is more behind this new protocol adds Dynamism to the NFTs. So let's add a decryption key and boom, we got our upgraded NFT, if you don't mind, make an applause for the first data morphe NFT in the world. It's a national auto. If you don't know, this is an animal that makes a metamorphosis when it wants to grow or get stressed. So an NFT from now on can be packed with lots of encrypted secret information that can be unlocked if you feed it the right key. And this unlocks lots of exciting potential.
00:24:45.822 - 00:25:55.062, Speaker A: Yes, we think there's great applicability for this sort of system with encryption in the financial industry. Think about creating futures contracts that you could have on the blockchain that's totally not mev. Like minor extracted value, possible possibilities. Also maybe even an order book. And be great for financial institutions that want to have financial transactions data on the blockchain where maybe you can keep it hidden from competitors. So we think this is going to be if we build it out and we get support, hopefully from Avi and others, we can really build this out and change the world for the better. Well, the last invitation this is an open source project, will be released, will be online for anyone that wants to join and make their own versions, branches or whatever of this to use in whatever you can imagine.
00:25:55.062 - 00:26:11.690, Speaker A: You're welcome. Thank you so much. You want to take a laptop? Never mind. This is my mistake. Next up, we have Kipi. Please welcome Kipi on stage.
00:26:22.070 - 00:27:02.720, Speaker C: Perfect. So, do you want to know? Pero la compatadora. Hi. So we're very excited to be here. We're keepi I'm sure that everyone knows that one of our biggest fears for those in crypto and even those that are not in crypto, is losing your private keys and losing access to all of your tokens. There's enough things going on in the market and we don't want people to have to worry about that. And to this end, we created Kippi, which is a serial knowledge private key recovery platform.
00:27:02.720 - 00:27:28.294, Speaker C: So we're going to show you. This is a very hyper technical project, but we don't want to bore you. So we're going to be kind of fast in the encryption part because it's kind of hard because the idea is like, how can you manage your keys, right? But you're not going to give me your keys if you don't know me, right? So I have to show you that we can actually save them in a very good way. So this is Felipe, and he's going to talk more about it.
00:27:28.492 - 00:28:07.750, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. I'm Felipe. Well, you can see from this diagram it is a little bit complex, but we'll see the main feature is that we'll use one ID that can prove the personhood of every user. Once we know the personhood, we can use it to encrypt the data the private key, in this case in such a manner that it is unique to every user. So even if one key is in one segment, a little vulnerable, that's just one case. And that's just one layer because we have several layers of security here. After that we will have a splitting of the key.
00:28:07.750 - 00:28:13.334, Speaker A: That is, we have a protector key. It is encrypted and then we split it.
00:28:13.372 - 00:28:13.960, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:16.970 - 00:28:50.638, Speaker A: Well, more diagram, but we can see that we split the key and store it in the IPFS. It is a public place, but it is secure still because every piece is uncorrelated when we do the retrieval process. The retrieval process uses zero knowledge proof such that the key isn't necessary to be retrieved at all. It's just necessary to be proven that it can be retrieven.
00:28:50.734 - 00:28:51.090, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:51.160 - 00:28:54.210, Speaker A: So no information is really unsafe.
00:28:58.790 - 00:29:27.120, Speaker C: Cool. So now we're going to show you how our initial MVP works. So the idea was to make a product that was very user, very intuitive, and you're able to connect with any of MetaMask wallet connect. And then you can copy paste your wallet and your email, and then you validate with WorldCoin at this point in time. Yeah, if you can show us the demo. So we verify if you're actually a person. And this is what gets everything started.
00:29:27.120 - 00:29:37.570, Speaker C: There you go. Don't worry about it. So what gets everything started? And then Atai is going to explain you what happens here in the backend.
00:29:38.070 - 00:30:19.150, Speaker A: Thank you, Doris. So what we did, Felipe was talking to you guys about how we encrypt the key and then we split it in parts. So the parts that the key is split into can be a random number and a random length. And then we form an encrypted array, which is eventually uploaded to IPFS. And IPFS gives us back an address that represents each of the shards of the already encrypted key. So it's a very safe way to store the shards. So how is the user going to use this? So let's say you don't remember your key and you want to retrieve it.
00:30:19.150 - 00:31:04.590, Speaker A: So what you do is that you prove that you are you, let's say, a world coin. And then that sends the key over to the backend. And in the back end, that key allows for the backend to retrieve all the addresses for the shards that are stored in IPFS. And then those shards are sent to the smart contract running on the mina blockchain in the back end, and finally you can retrieve your key. So like Doris said, it's a really technical problem, but it's a highly technical solution that makes it really easy and really safe for you guys to store your keys.
00:31:05.250 - 00:31:10.480, Speaker C: Can we see a demo? Yeah, we're going to show you how it works. I think it's pretty cool.
00:31:12.450 - 00:32:09.490, Speaker A: So you see here there's a private key and there's a string, which is the let's call it the secret and so when we hit process keys so it's going to go here and then it's going to start doing all the encryption. And so you see that there's already the shards and then what you're looking at is the shards returning address. And then what we build out of that is an array of addresses that can't be linked to the user. Okay. At least not in the front end. And since we're running the smart contract from the Mina blockchain on the back end that lives safely in there and can permanently keep your keys safeguarded and then this is what we store and it would be really hard for anybody to try and know what it is. But we're talking technical details here.
00:32:09.640 - 00:32:16.580, Speaker C: Yeah. So I know that felipe, you were telling me about how this could be hyper secure at some point.
00:32:17.110 - 00:32:22.994, Speaker A: Yeah. So you can see that this is your private key. Now it is distributed all over the blockchain.
00:32:23.042 - 00:32:23.640, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:24.410 - 00:32:45.738, Speaker A: We can take that calculation and use something like for example, the Mina protocol that you can use zero knowledge proof and then from these ten charts just get one certificate of proof that can be considered like a new private key, a new representation of your ownership, but it is obfuscated.
00:32:45.834 - 00:32:46.480, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:47.010 - 00:33:11.414, Speaker A: And then we can do it all over again, we can split it, we can do all this process again and get another chart. So it is like distributing all the information of the ownership of all of us in the blockchain in such a way that it is not necessary to be concentrated centralized in just one asset. That is the private key group.
00:33:11.452 - 00:33:11.894, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:12.012 - 00:33:19.880, Speaker A: So that's one future work, right, in all the umbrella of application that this project can have.
00:33:20.410 - 00:33:25.100, Speaker C: Anyways, thank you very much guys. Keeping thank you.
00:33:29.310 - 00:33:39.690, Speaker A: Congratulations. All right, next up we have Kiwik on that side and up next is Sellout to get ready here on my left, please welcome Kiwik on stage.
00:34:03.210 - 00:34:31.246, Speaker C: Only last year there were 3 billion gamers playing online. And we know this will continue to grow more and more because of Metaverse, AR and VR developments. This will become a 1 trillion industry in only eight years. And we know that Web Three has very exciting use cases for Metaverse and for gaming. But builders are having real issues. They have a lack of quality and affordable 3D assets. They have to look around in different platforms that they are not interoperable between them.
00:34:31.246 - 00:35:19.098, Speaker C: So if you buy something in unity, you cannot use it on unreal engine and that's a real pain for the builders. And there's also like very expensive fees that they need to pay and this slows down the development of games currently on the market. There are different players tackling parts of this problem. There are decentralized marketplaces where you can monetize your assets, others where you can display your work, but there's none of them that can come together and bring a solution for this community. So this is why we created Kiwik. Kiwik means marketplace in Maya, and this is the NFT marketplace for metaverse builders and game developers. Our goal is to empower creators to create high quality content to accelerate the game development, and also to give some financial tools for the game dev and for the metabolt builders.
00:35:19.098 - 00:35:55.960, Speaker C: And of course, build more and better games for the 3 billion people that they're playing around. One of the best features that we have that make us real different is the part of the ownership with the NFCs that they will have, they will have also engine agnostic. So no matter if you're developing Unreal or Unity or other engines, you can upload them. Our website, there's the Buy Now, pay later feature that you can acquire the assets with a credit for you. There are insights to develop smarter content. We have a social component and some rewards to keep the quality top of the platform. Hello.
00:35:55.960 - 00:36:31.512, Speaker C: I did not plan this ahead. Okay, hello. Here is the amazing live demo that hopefully works on the first try. So here we have the home page of our marketplace keyweek. And you can see that once you are launched into the home page, you have a featured asset. And you can preview 3D models, which are uploaded on IPFS and Minted on Polygon. So you can rotate around the 3D models and zoom in and out to preview them.
00:36:31.512 - 00:37:12.116, Speaker C: Then if you scroll down, you'll see some trending assets, the most popular assets. Also, if you go to the Explore page, you'll have more detailed assets, more assets that you can scroll through. As you can see, we have a lot of them here. There will also be a search and filter page, which later on, we will show we couldn't implement it in the two days, but we will show how that looks. And so let's see if we click View Details. For example, you'll see we have our model here, which we can rotate. It's a little finicky that's okay, well, you're supposed to be okay, there we go.
00:37:12.116 - 00:38:15.420, Speaker C: You're supposed to be able to rotate it. And then you can see all the details of this model, the triangles, the vertices, very important information for game developers, metaverse builders, and basically, what's cool about this is that this is linked to your social profile. So, for example, if we click Shannon, which Shannon is the amazing UI UX designer of our team, you'll see that we have this creator profile. And so now we assign a face to the person making the assets, and you can follow them and be notified on all of their upcoming assets. And this is using the lens protocol. So you have your own Lens account, and it also uses WorldCoin to authenticate that you're an actual person so that we don't get scammers uploading a ton of bad assets to our marketplace because we want to ensure we have high quality assets, right? But back to this character. Let's say you like it and you want to buy the NFT.
00:38:15.420 - 00:38:53.272, Speaker C: So this is an NFT that you buy one cool feature. We have several ways to pay. One cool feature is buy now, Pay later, which exists in web two, but not really in web3. And the way it works is that if you don't have enough funds to pay for it now, or you just want to try it and not pay the full price, you can pay it in installments. And this uses the Superfluid API. And once you mint the NFT, it starts that transaction with Superfluid and also mints it on. So this is just the creator profile that you can create your profile, and it's verified by WorldCoin.
00:38:53.272 - 00:39:23.940, Speaker C: And yes, I believe that's the end of my part. Text. Hello. Hello. I don't know why this looks blurry, but this is supposed to be our UI. So as you could see in the implementation, there were some bugs. So I just wanted to show off kind of what it could be when we continue the project.
00:39:23.940 - 00:39:42.140, Speaker C: So here's the home page. This is kind of like the profile view. My boy Anakin here. I hate sand. 14. Yeah. So if I wanted to follow him, I can go along and see other creators that might be similar, see what kind of assets that he's creating.
00:39:42.140 - 00:40:04.950, Speaker C: I can also search, so I can go by filters and find results curated to exactly what I need in my project. Another important aspect is the community. So you can search for all kinds of people. It's not just anakin. Everyone has a profile on here. You can follow them. You can follow along in their journey as they're creating assets and contributing to the community.
00:40:04.950 - 00:40:36.880, Speaker C: If you want to check out more of our figma assets, you can add this QR code. Hello. We're not done. We're not done. So we created our Tokens on polygno with a supply of 100 million. And every time an asset has four or five stars, it's rewarded with Tokens. This is why we encourage people to contribute to the community and to have high quality assets.
00:40:36.880 - 00:41:04.250, Speaker C: So thank you so much to all of these amazing sponsors. In conclusion, Keyweek will revolutionize the game development industry by empowering the builders. And we'll do this, and we're doing this through Tokenization community, and engine agnostic assets. So thank you all so much.
00:41:10.080 - 00:41:14.780, Speaker A: All right, next up, we have Sellout and on deck emergence. So please welcome Jack from Sellout.
00:41:25.410 - 00:41:55.378, Speaker D: Hey, everybody. My name is Jack. I created Sellout. Sellout is a react component library for bringing web two checkout experiences to web3. So essentially, all a developer has to do is to wrap their app or marketplace in the Sellout provider, and you have access to this great checkout experience from start to finish. So let's dive into a quick demo here. We've got a marketplace.
00:41:55.378 - 00:42:36.882, Speaker D: Let's go ahead and buy one of these T shirts. So immediately when you click Buy, you're greeted with a great modal that everybody is used to from the Web Two checkout experience. I took a lot of inspiration from Rainbow Kit, which is a recent UX developer kit for connecting wallets to Ethereum. So this modal contains all of the order information that you need, as well as promo codes, or if you need to collect an address from the user to send them a physical item. And all of this information, once you click Confirm, payment is uploaded onto IPFS. So let's go ahead and submit this transaction. You can see it's for the correct.
00:42:36.936 - 00:42:37.540, Speaker A: Amount.
00:42:39.930 - 00:43:35.750, Speaker D: And once we confirm the payment, all of the order data is packaged up, and we can view a receipt of the transaction on a new page on this hosted demo site. But in the URL is the IPFS hash. So if you're a vendor, you can have an IPFS hash in your order book for additional verifiability, so you can send the buyer the exact information on the order details, all from IPFS. The checkout experience also works with NFTs. So I deployed a custom polygon contract on Mumbai to mint this awesome ETH Mexico hacker badge. So again, the similar Checkout experience is here. All of the theming is customizable within the modal, so you can change different color schemes.
00:43:35.750 - 00:44:30.232, Speaker D: Got any dark mode fans in the room? And let's go ahead and mint this NFT. And again, all of those customizations are available via Props to a single react component that you can place anywhere in your app. So the developer experience for taking an app from just a proof of concept marketplace to having actual marketplace functionality is this much code. You have product data, you have a checkout modal that you can place anywhere, and then you have a Sellout provider that you wrap your app in, and you've got Checkout on Web Three, and it's a great experience. So we've got a great README as well. So feel free to check that out. And that is sellout.
00:44:30.232 - 00:44:31.390, Speaker D: Thank you, guys.
00:44:36.000 - 00:44:56.764, Speaker A: Congratulations. Congratulations. Next up emergence. And on deck stacks, please welcome Emergence. Yes. Okay. All right.
00:44:56.764 - 00:45:42.140, Speaker A: What's up y'all? We are emergence. So at Emergence, we believe that the best way to onboard new users into Dows is through face to face interactions. So the problems that we identified are DAOs have a problem onboarding. It's mostly through discord, through asynchronous conversation. It's hard to get metrics on DAOs and as well as documentation. And so basically our approach is we incentivize Dow members to interact with potential new Dow members through token streaming in basically a Web Three version of Zoom. And then we get more people to join Dows and the cycle continues.
00:45:42.140 - 00:46:26.810, Speaker A: And so we'll get right into the demo here. So this is our homepage. We call this the dowry. So each Dow is going to have their own smart contract, which has a combination of superfluid and Semaphore logic and each Dow can hold their own treasury to give to the Dow members. And so we just went into the ETH Global Dow. So this Dao has nine rooms and we're going to join a room here in a second and start streaming with a user. So basically we're going to have Danilo over there is going to be the Dao member and then we're going to have a new user and simulate that experience.
00:46:26.810 - 00:47:41.168, Speaker A: So right now you can type in your name and then you go into the channel and I'll let Danelo take it from here. So the idea of the so the main purpose of our platform is to allow people to meet more online and especially in decentralized communities. We believe that if you create more spaces where people can connect, more things can emerge that we couldn't even imagine. So our DAP is a way to incentivize Verified Down members to receive Superfluid tokens as they are participating in online meetings. And we are using Semaphore as identity layer and also a way to keep privacy from the user so that people don't know who are they meeting, when they're meeting, and they can keep their privacy and just allow people to know when they want. So how the depth work is first you need to open a room. So this room opens a session on a smart contract and you can only start to claim tokens when this room is open.
00:47:41.168 - 00:48:30.556, Speaker A: And there is a way to verify people who are in the chat and also who is claiming for this room session. So as soon as the transaction goes through, we will see that the room ID will pop up here. In the meantime, we are showing our handsome teammates that maybe the internet is a little bit laggy. So we're waiting a little bit for the transaction to go through. And our main motive here is to I think he left the room, left me alone. We're still waiting for the transaction. While we wait, we want to also show another part of the DAP.
00:48:30.556 - 00:49:28.880, Speaker A: Right after the room gets the transaction goes through, we will generate a proof and then start the transaction. But on the meanwhile we want to show another page, that is the admin page for the DAOs admin where they can see all the rooms and all the meetings that are happening without showing any data from the user. So for example, here there is room one that has this purpose and this is a voting that every member can vote on the meeting without revealing who they are. So this is an average vote of how the meeting was, amount of token that was distributed on the meeting and some other information. And another cool feature that we have implemented is that for every meeting, in the end we will use an artificial intelligence to generate a transcription of the meeting. And this is the transcription of our demo that we. Created.
00:49:28.880 - 00:50:28.600, Speaker A: And the idea to generate a text transcription is that we can generate data from meetings, also keeping the users a little bit more private compared to videos and audios. The idea also is that later this transcription will be encrypted so only specific members or only through vote, it could be accessed. And besides the transcription, my spelling is a little bit bad. It should be dow, not doe. And besides the transcription, this artificial intelligence also generates a sentiment of how the meeting was and also some possible topics that will help the Dao to have some more data of what is happening on the ecosystem while keeping privacy of the users who are participating. So it seems the room wasn't created, maybe. Yeah, the transaction is still pending.
00:50:28.600 - 00:51:27.416, Speaker A: Yeah. So yeah, I will just explain what would happen here. We can show on the smart contract basically what would happen here. This smart contract is outdated, but when you create a room, we are just basically creating a session and saying that this is true. And basically then we are generating a proof and sending the transaction to request funds with the proof that was generated by the Semaphore protocol that I am member of a specific group. And here we are using the external nullifier to match the room ID so that each proof can only request fund once from each session. Even though it's anonymous, we can have this locking measure where a member can only request fund once from each room.
00:51:27.416 - 00:52:22.550, Speaker A: So yeah, it is still pending. And the idea is that here it would generate the proof and then when you exit the meeting, it will close the session and at the same time it would close the streams from all the transactions. So yeah, thank you, thank you. I know it won't be a hackathon with that Murphy's lock kicking in, so I think you still got to see what this project was able to do. And with that, let's welcome our next team, Stacks. Hello. My name is Ian and I'm part of Stacks.
00:52:22.550 - 00:53:06.098, Speaker A: What we built was a new social media platform. We really wanted to tackle social media. Oftentimes when we scroll Instagram, we're bothered because every time we scroll we see reels and from influencers that we don't even know, we see a lot of sponsored content and the algorithm is bombarding us with content that we don't really know where it's coming from. And so what we really wanted to build was a new social media where we kind of wanted to focus on micro interactions with our friends, our family and people that we really care about. And we wanted to create something that doesn't rely on an algorithm built on artificial intelligence. And so we built stacks. It's built on top of Lens protocol.
00:53:06.098 - 00:53:27.146, Speaker A: We use Wallet Connect and it's all on polygon. So here's our app. I think the Internet is pretty slow, so I'll just switch tabs. This is what the homepage will look like. So stacks are basically collections of content on Lens. And so right here you can see a stack. It's called chrome.
00:53:27.146 - 00:54:16.382, Speaker A: So you can create your own topic called Chrome, Solar Power, anything you wanted to create. And you can start adding content to those stacks. And the idea is that you can subscribe to stacks and then you'll get updates when people add to those stacks. So instead of machine learning algorithm curating your feed for you, you actually follow feeds that are curated by real people and people that you care about. So if we click in here, you can see something like different images that people have added to the stack called Chrome. And then if you wanted to, you could add this to your own stack that you're part of. And if we go back, you can scroll through your home feed I think I mentioned this already, but you can see stacks that people are creating and things that people you follow are contributing to.
00:54:16.382 - 00:54:44.994, Speaker A: And so you can also view profiles. So this person has created Chrome and architecture stacks. And here's our new stack page. So if you want to make a new stack, you could call it something like Lens Create Stack. And this creates a new post on Lens. So if you're not familiar with Lens, it's a social media protocol. And so this is a different implementation of Lens.
00:54:44.994 - 00:55:01.258, Speaker A: Someone else built a UI and you can see that this is a post. And we've just displayed the post differently on our UI. So we want to create like a new unique experience on the front end. Yeah, that was something we really focus on, the UI. You want to talk about that more?
00:55:01.344 - 00:55:29.234, Speaker C: Yes. So hi everyone. I'm Julia. I was the designer for this project and I'm going to just thank you. So, yeah, we weren't able to build the full flow of the app, so I just wanted to take us through what the full experience would look like. So this is kind of like what the fully built out feed like, we envision. So with friends and influences, you would be able to see individual posts that your friends reacted to.
00:55:29.234 - 00:56:29.346, Speaker C: Influences is more for people you're inspired by, like, designers you look up to, et cetera, and you would also be able to see their activity whenever they create a new stacks or respond to an image. And then there's also like a general feed. So when you click on a stacks like this board, this is kind of like what it would expand out to look like. So the idea was that you can create like a public board that anyone can add to, or you can kind of limit it to, so only a certain number of people, like close friends can collaborate with it. Yeah, and then we kind of really wanted to focus on minimal UI that showcased the actual work of the creator. So this is kind of like what when you kind of upload a picture to a stack it would look like. So you can either choose to upload if you're like a creator, you can choose to upload a picture of your own creation as a collection on Lens or you can upload someone thing that's not your own as a curation.
00:56:29.346 - 00:57:13.554, Speaker C: And we also wanted to hopefully expand to use referral fees on Lens and introduce a wave where you can cap it so it can focus on kind of like curating the best quality content to the top and yeah, kind of continuing on to the end. So once you kind of upload it, this is what it would look like and this is what the profile feed looks like. So you can kind of see all of the stacks that a user has curated as well as their influences. And yeah, this is just a quick preview of what the uploading process would look like as you're in the process of creating one. So yeah, now I'm going to hand it over to Sheena and Mia to talk about some of the things. Oh, hi, my name is Sheena. I am from Florida.
00:57:13.554 - 00:57:46.098, Speaker C: I'm one of the developers on the team. One of the use cases that we really wanted to showcase was fashion. Because a lot of the things now for fashion designers is to really showcase their designs and for someone else to not steal that design and for them to actually showcase that. They were the first person to actually have that mockup. So for designers and creatives, we wanted to create a platform that allows for them to monetize in the way that they see their art to be displayed. Right. And with that, there's many complaints out there.
00:57:46.098 - 00:58:22.460, Speaker C: Sorry. Hi, I'm Mia from La. With everything that they have said so far, there have been many complaints all across Instagram to make Instagram instagram again, there's actually this one influencer that has over 300,000 followers that made a post viral to just want to see cute photos of their friends. And it doesn't necessarily have to be influencers with a large following. It could be for people that have from zero to 100 or 200 influencers. But with this, we just wanted to create a social platform that is what people want. And this is also Shannon, another designer in our team.
00:58:22.460 - 00:59:23.966, Speaker C: Like Mia said, I'm Shannon, I'm from Miami and I'm the visual designer for this project. As a content creator, you really get bogged down by different companies not recognizing you for your work. And we wanted to create an interface that didn't look so much like Instagram or Pinterest in their own unique ways so that new people, new creators integrated into Web three could feasibly use this product. And the interface was made so that hopefully well, people usually look at something and three or 4 seconds later their eyes glaze over and they don't want to look at it again. So we were trying to create an interface where people wanted to stay on it and look at the content a little bit more and keep on the creative side. Thank you so much. Thank you guys.
00:59:23.966 - 00:59:25.070, Speaker C: Stacks.
00:59:28.550 - 00:59:29.566, Speaker A: Congratulations.
00:59:29.678 - 00:59:30.574, Speaker B: Stacks.
00:59:30.702 - 01:00:14.710, Speaker A: Next up, Block Community. Please welcome Block Community. On stage and on deck will be Epoint. Hi everyone. It's an honor to be here with so many awesome projects. We don't have the most technology solution, but we think that it's a solution for a real problem that we have every day. So in a minute it's going to be sorry, I'll start to talk about the project.
01:00:14.710 - 01:01:25.990, Speaker A: We have a problem principle in Mexico and I think in very countries in Latin America, maybe in Europe or something, that we live in gated communities. When the other administration of the community, that administrator is one person of a little person and he had to receive the pace, the monthly pace of all the neighborhoods. And it's a difficult way to do. We think that he put that in the blockchain, that was transparency. And we can view the traceability of the money and where it starts, where the neighbor paid to the board of the management and where should go the money. So there is no ways to one neighbor pays his bills and there is a ticket from the pay that he do. Sorry about this.
01:01:25.990 - 01:02:00.440, Speaker A: Okay, we're almost ready to go. You really have a very good intro. Not with a very good English, but I do my best. I'm sorry. No, I think it's over. There you go. That's right.
01:02:00.440 - 01:02:34.624, Speaker A: Okay. Hi everyone, I'm Diego. Let's talk a little bit about Black Community. This is our team. He is my brother, a full stack dev, Paco Trejo and I'm a project manager. Okay, so just giving a little recap about Paco mentioned right now. In Mexico, there are a lot of problems with closed gated communities in which properties inside of them are owned by different people.
01:02:34.624 - 01:04:13.412, Speaker A: And these people not always share the same way of thinking, right? So even though each person has their own property inside these gated communities, the management of specific areas could be difficult and must be taken care of by someone, right? Like keeping security, the maintenance, the water and garbage collection, et cetera. But who is responsible for all this? How does a community decide who is the most appropriate person to take care of these activities? And who will handle the management fees paid by each property owner? So, like, the model that we are trying to offer via webtree and crypto is that community members who are the property owners can pay in a transparent way via wallet and with crypto their management fees. So a community administration will receive all this money paid by the property owners and they will be able to make expenses also in a transparent way. All these resources will be in a treasury wallet and that's why it will be all traceable. Right? So basically what we built these days, it's adapt for payments and traceability oriented to physical gated communities. I'll try to show what we built. Let's see if the connection.
01:04:13.412 - 01:05:08.500, Speaker A: Let me. So it's a very basic DAP in which you can sign in and register your own property. This is the interface block community. You can save your new property with your wallet address and to consult your property fee that you will be paying month by month. There you can also consult what is your monthly fee and the ability to pay. See if it's working already. There you go.
01:05:08.500 - 01:05:56.050, Speaker A: So I'll try like if I was registered, we are open to any designer can help us with that. We are developers, not designers. So here I will be able to register my property and also the fee that I'll be paying. In that way, I already registered my property. I will only be able to do this if before someone let me. Right? Because no one could register a property if they're not part of the community. Also here I'll check my monthly fee associated to my wallet address and I'll be able to pay directly in this platform.
01:05:56.050 - 01:06:41.392, Speaker A: Also, an NFT will be minted month by month and every year to show that I've already paid and giving a little bit more about how it works. Only property owners will be able to make payments in the DAP. The funds will be received in a treasury wallet. Every payment will have an NFT that work as a proof of payment. Any expense funds leaving the treasury wallet will be easily verifiable in the blockchain and traceable. If you pay early, you receive a management token. And also if you pay late, you will have to buy that token directly from other token holders, those who paid early to pay for the interest generated by your late payment.
01:06:41.392 - 01:07:24.668, Speaker A: Here we want to create like a tokenomics that will work to keep a circular economic inside the communities. And someone will have a benefit if they're paying early or they're being a good neighbor. And also who pay late will have to pay more using those tokens. And what are future plans? Create the tokenomics for the project utility Token, improve UI and find a wallet partner to make it accessible to anyone, any community all around the world. And that's it. Thank you, guys. Congratulations and thank you.
01:07:24.668 - 01:08:17.430, Speaker A: All right, next up is Eatpoint and Ondex Veritas. Please welcome eatpoint on stage. Thank you. Hello, everyone. We are at points. And we are Victor right there. Alex.
01:08:17.430 - 01:09:12.518, Speaker A: And I'm Luis eduardo. And we are the mobile first and point of sale application for ethereum and polygon ecosystem that brings together traditional finance with web3 through Wallet Connect. So let's see if this works. Okay? A very wise man once said so total crypto coin market cap of just half a trillion. That was 2017. What have we earned it? And then he said, how many unbanked people have we banked. And actually, if we take a look at the market cap that we had last year, have you noticed any kind of improvements about them banked and about people rising and getting financial inclusion? Well, in our Latin American ecosystem, not so much.
01:09:12.518 - 01:09:49.906, Speaker A: The region has very poor credit inclusion and digital banking numbers, these are abysmal. 45% of adults do not have any bank account. That means no digital lending thing to do anything. 79% had no borrowed any type of credit from financial institutions. And just 12% aren't saving any kind of money in any kind of account. But we are in the region of magical realism and somehow we have great infrastructure on the cell phone and telecommunication side. 73%.
01:09:49.906 - 01:10:28.186, Speaker A: I mean, you go to the small pueblos everywhere and you find people even in the lowest poverty rates with a cell phone, and that's 7.1% of GDP in the region. And these numbers will keep on growing. Well, Ms. Ajami. Jagucci, also the EA Foundation is actually looking at those numbers directly. And well, this slide is quite important because we have what is ecom revenue and point of sale revenue, which is cash and credit cards.
01:10:28.186 - 01:11:18.926, Speaker A: Right. And that is well, the difference between billions 525,000,000,000 till just a couple of billions that we have there is quite remarkable. And that's a great opportunity because digital wallets are projected to overtake great cars and cash by 2024. With some help. There is a huge opportunity for an integration of traditional finance with Web Three via mobile phones and point of sale systems. So we came up with a solution that integrates wallet connect and polygon with POS using USDC, USDT and some other stable coins and wallet connect which join us to this point of sale system to do any kind of transactions and sales. So let's try this.
01:11:18.926 - 01:11:32.202, Speaker A: Live staff can use switch to the other laptop. Hello. Yeah.
01:11:32.256 - 01:11:33.200, Speaker B: Switch, please.
01:11:35.010 - 01:12:09.400, Speaker A: All right. There, Victor is a store clerk, right? And he's going to sell his Poncho. So now Alex wants to buy it, but he has no cash. So what does he do? He gets his phone app that has a digital wallet. And now what you see there is here. So you just fill everything. It may take a while.
01:12:09.400 - 01:13:11.500, Speaker A: And that's just a scan with rainbow wallet, for example. And by the way, this is on Matic, Mainet with real money and everything. So wait a second, wait a second. So he goes ahead. He already had the confirmation and Victor is waiting for his and there it is. And he's going to just give him his ticket. Not yet staff.
01:13:11.500 - 01:13:56.454, Speaker A: And then he's going to corroborate the transaction on Mainet. So that's Mainet. That is everything from our side. We are team at point. Thank you. That was absolutely incredible. This deserves another round of applause.
01:13:56.454 - 01:14:30.050, Speaker A: A real live demo of a payment on Mainet. This is incredible. All right, next up we have spiritus and then three more demos to go and then we'll get into the talk and the prizes. So please welcome Spirit US on stage, everybody. I think my laptop is currently dying. Oh, yeah. It seems to be a little bit frozen at the moment.
01:14:30.050 - 01:14:51.108, Speaker A: Yeah, we can just start talking and hope that my laptop figures things out. Yeah. My name is Ilan, I'm from Australia. Had 1 hour of sleep last night. It's nice to meet you all. And I am one half of spiritus. So we believe that in the opening ceremony we spoke about onboarding the next billion people to Web three.
01:14:51.108 - 01:15:25.648, Speaker A: And I think something that we have a responsibility to do as developers is to not just build developer tooling which still has a whole there's a whole range of improvements we can make. It's also to build things that help people that aren't technically experienced build, experience, create and get involved. Not only that, but specifically for NFTs, which is what we're building for. We think that we want more interesting collections. We don't just want the next pixelated artificial Artvark alliance which I mean, we will buy, we want something more interesting, which is why we built Spiritus. We wanted to build a dynamic NFT base layer. Yeah.
01:15:25.648 - 01:16:10.892, Speaker A: And there's a few pain points in the development ecosystem right now. The asset generation process is a bit of an iterative slog. Usually the artist is creating the layers. They're sending you the layers on dropbox, you're downloading it to your local computer, generating the assets and repeat ad nauseam. So it would be nice if you had one place where you had all of your layers, you could generate everything you want in one place. Another thing is that without the layers, the way the current ecosystem works is there's not a ton of collaboration and creativity, especially with the community, especially with CCO projects. CCO talks a lot about remixing projects and derivatives and community involvement.
01:16:10.892 - 01:16:59.440, Speaker A: And a lot of projects that claim to be CCO don't do a lot to know talk about their CCO morals and their principles. So it would be nice if you had one place where you could have all of your layers, you could remix and do all that kind of stuff. And then lastly, the thing is, a lot of the times, the NFTs these days, the most important thing that people really look for is the image itself. And the metadata is often looked at as an afterthought, whereas it doesn't make a lot of sense. We think it should be metadata driven because the metadata is what's creating the asset itself. It's what's giving you the token value. So creating a paradigm that allows you to generate art, generate assets from the metadata itself, as opposed to just generating the metadata alongside the art.
01:16:59.440 - 01:17:29.224, Speaker A: Beautiful. And I think my laptop is now working, thank God. I'll briefly talk through, I guess, what our tech stack is, what we're trying to build and then I'll give you a live demo. It's also live in production and I'll share the URL at the end of this. So, in accordance with what we've spoken about, we are building on Polygon because we think dynamic NFTs almost necessarily have to use a layer two if they want to have the rate of transactions to keep things fresh. Continually update thinking of video games, for example. We host all of our layers and we'll get into that later.
01:17:29.224 - 01:18:09.672, Speaker A: And images with IPFS using NFC storage. We also built an example contract with Tableland because we think it's an exciting new way to store your data while still having on chain write access, but public read access to these SQL tables everywhere. We use Wallet Connect v Two to sign into our app because we think that from a developer standpoint, there's a lot of benefit in having MultiChain instantiation just right off the bat, rather than having to change different providers to a different network every time you want to look at a different connection. And yeah, NFT storage as I spoke about. So I reckon it's demo time. Hope it works. All right, so this is one example of one use case.
01:18:09.672 - 01:18:59.060, Speaker A: A user could come onto our platform, they could connect with Wall Connect to enable interchain operability on the chain interoperability. So we're signing here and as you can see, we're connecting to both Polygon Mumbai and Ethereum Mainnet at the same time, which is just a nice sort of layer of abstraction because someone not that technically knowledgeable might not know that there's a difference between a collection on polygon versus mainnet versus optimism. This allows us to handle that all for them, for a platform that should be able to remix layers and create new assets and all this kind of stuff, you don't want to be restricted to one chain specifically. So having Wall Connect really powers us to do that. Yeah. And the core of our product is the server itself. Our app is kind of half an example of what someone could build using our server and also half an example of a public good.
01:18:59.060 - 01:19:28.620, Speaker A: As we'll get to later on, we're going to support the ability for anyone to come in, add a collection that supports various interfaces and play around. So I'm going to sign a message. An example of what a consumer of our server might want to do is have some sort of authentication using Wallet Connect v two signing. We've signed. Now it's time to put in a contract address. So we are using the Nouns contract. It's actually interesting, as we spoke about before, often the image is really all that matters for NSEs nowadays.
01:19:28.620 - 01:19:53.064, Speaker A: Nouns don't actually have any attributes, so we've had to hard code them ourselves. Oh, that is not the contract address because it is not copying. Let me just get it quickly. Nounsdao. Thank you. I'll just grab it quickly because my Vs code is not very happy with me right now. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to input the contract address here.
01:19:53.064 - 01:20:25.090, Speaker A: And what we've done is we've uploaded all of the layers to IPFS and we've exposed a layers Uri on the contract so that we can read from the contract and just instantiate sort of all the layers and have it in this nice, easy to use app. Let me just get the nounsdale. Contract. I don't have it off the top of my head. Going open. See, don't rug me now, as you have many times in the past. All right, let me grab the contract address.
01:20:25.090 - 01:20:52.872, Speaker A: Cool. So we'll put this into here. It's going to hit our server, see if we have it supported, which apparently we don't. Okay. Can't fix that at the moment, but yeah, I can show you. I'll put up a quick video of what it was meant to look like. My laptop makes it that far, so I'll skip to the end if my laptop allows it.
01:20:52.872 - 01:21:26.764, Speaker A: So, yeah, after you've instantiated the contract, what we basically have is this nice, easy to use thing where you can change the metadata of an NFT. And what our server will do in the background is it'll generate a new image on the fly, upload it to IPFS, and then pass you this new CID. No, I think my computer barely has visual. It's done. Yeah. Well, this is quite unfortunate. So we actually know that we use Table Land as one of the technologies that we're using.
01:21:26.764 - 01:21:33.020, Speaker A: So what's nice about Table Land when we're talking about metadata driven development is we could do something. Oh, it looks like we're live.
01:21:33.090 - 01:21:33.324, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:21:33.362 - 01:22:16.460, Speaker A: So this is the video. So as you can see here, we've loaded in all the layers and then now you can basically go through them and generate your own NFT on the fly. And our server, every time you change a trait, is going to generate a new image. It's going to pin that to IPFS and then it's going to yeah, as I said, I don't think my computer has visual, but yeah, this sort of gets the idea. And I think what we're more interested in, I guess, is what we want to build on top of this. We want to create a platform where anyone, whether you're a developer and you want to interact with our server directly through the APIs, you're an artist. You want to upload layers via our UI and then create collections, create individual NFTs, possibly have a proxy contract to actually deploy it yourself, or you're just a member of a community and you want to play around.
01:22:16.460 - 01:22:32.690, Speaker A: It's a CCO project. You want to play around. You can go in here, you can create NFTs. We'll pin it for you, we'll give you the CID, and then you have everything you need without having to spin up all the infrastructure yourself. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Pretty much it, yeah. Thanks for bearing with me.
01:22:32.690 - 01:22:50.760, Speaker A: Thank you, spiritos. I know sometimes these things happen, but we'll add the video to your showcase if it's not there already. All right, next up is Ethereum uncensored. Please welcome Ethereum Uncensored on stage.
01:22:58.700 - 01:23:19.900, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. First of all, thank you for this amazing opportunity. We are very, very honored to be here. And first, I want to introduce to you the amazing team here of the Ethereum Uncensored. My name is Brisia. Hello, I'm Teresa.
01:23:21.440 - 01:23:25.140, Speaker A: I'm Ubash. And I am Nico.
01:23:26.040 - 01:24:15.090, Speaker C: And I'm anna. And today we've seen amazing projects, but none of them work if the base layer Ethereum doesn't remain censorship resistant. So that's why we are here. Ethereum censored can change and save the future of Ethereum and the whole ecosystem. Something that can't be denied is the possibility of a chain suffering an attack. Historically, we have witnessed many censorship attempts indicating a probability that they could also occur within the Ethereum network. But what's the problem? There is no any tracking system that store information about the Orphan Blocks.
01:24:15.090 - 01:25:02.160, Speaker C: These blocks can be malicious and are accidentally or intentionally taken out of the chain. Currently, it's very difficult to correlate the information about them. There is no data that makes this possible. So we can't find out if there's a malicious block. But we have a solution for this. A public good tool for the Ethereum community that informs when an Orphan Block appears and may have been intentionally censored and allows the community to take action against these intentional attacks and avoid censorship. Our product is a user friendly, simple and real time dashboard that allows the community to make a correlation between the Orphan Blocks.
01:25:02.160 - 01:25:13.290, Speaker C: What happened if many of the Orphan Blocks are from the same validator? Maybe that is an attack. And Ethereum Unconsensor will inform you will inform the community.
01:25:15.420 - 01:26:17.480, Speaker A: So the most important thing here is for normal users to be able to easily identify possible censorship attempts. So for this matter, we develop a web app that will show all the information regarding Orphan Blocks. Users will be able to see all the latest Orphan Blocks, but they also will be able to see three different leaderboards, such as most censored protocols, most censored individuals and most censoring validators. On another order of things, users are also able to see the transactions that were contained on that Orphan Block, but also see information about that involved validator. So once blocks actually contain real and relevant information, we're going to crunch that data to be as certain as possible about suspected censorship attempts. The web app interacts with our backend, which is a Rest API and queries for different data. But what data? It can be Orphan Blocks or the transactions included in these Orphan Blocks.
01:26:17.480 - 01:27:23.500, Speaker A: And the back end also is responsible to track the transactions in the Orphan Blocks and analyze them like the transactions is coming from which users, the transactions are from which protocols, and the transactions are for. What else can be censored? We cannot allow censors. We cannot allow reaching the protocols. We cannot allow coding to be crime. But how does it work? Our back end runs periodically to detect new created blocks from the validators and creates logs for the database. And there are different parts in our database. We store the blocks if it's orphaned and include the transactions in that block so that we can analyze the orphan blocks and their validators and the transactions.
01:27:23.500 - 01:27:36.310, Speaker A: And we will be able to analyze possible censorships for users, for protocols and malicious validators. That's how the app works.
01:27:37.720 - 01:28:19.712, Speaker C: Great. So, okay, what are our goals for this project? First of all, we have to know that we're here building on QM because of the censorship resistance. And that the centralization it offers. So having a tool like this that is going to inform the community about possible censorship, it's based up the values that we're aiming to fulfill in Ethereum. So we're going to have this solution ready before we actually need it. And why? Well, as you can tell, we didn't apply for any of the sponsors. We're only applying for this pull up a good made for Ethereum.
01:28:19.712 - 01:28:27.830, Speaker C: So we do believe it's super important for the whole community to unite and think about these issues and actually build solutions towards them.
01:28:32.450 - 01:29:11.420, Speaker A: So, as for a near future, we want to improve the UX and the UI of our app. Then, once the merge actually happens, data will be more widely available for everyone and we will be able to improve our analysis. Once that happens, we need to call for action within the community for the data providers to focus more on this important topic. With better information sources, we can actually improve our parent finding analysis to find attacks as they are happening. And finally, as the final step, we'd like to have a telegram and Twitter bot that could alert users about ongoing or past attacks. Thank you all very much. And let's all save Ethereum together.
01:29:11.420 - 01:29:43.240, Speaker A: I will make one more call for data providers in Beacon Chain. There is no data provider provides orphan blocks data in Beacon Chain, for example, infra Alchemy. And all of the data providers should improve that. And one more call for the community. We have proposed DevCon eight for Istanbul. Please look our proposal and we will love to see a terrible community in Istanbul. Thank you.
01:29:43.240 - 01:30:12.938, Speaker A: Congratulations. Ethereum Uncensored. All right, next up is our second last demo for today and that is Project Reunited. Please welcome them on stage. Thank you. Thanks everyone. There's been so many great projects today.
01:30:12.938 - 01:30:33.400, Speaker A: I'm so proud to be here with you all and with all these great projects. So today Mario and I, let me introduce the team very quickly. Here is Mario. Hi. I don't speak English. My English is very bad. But I can try communicate my own idea.
01:30:33.400 - 01:31:01.998, Speaker A: And he's the mastermind behind this. I'm just helping mastermind and very nice and kind, heart. And then here is diego. He's going to help us with the demo. So we are reunited and we want to alleviate pain worldwide. So public goods are good. Man go to next.
01:31:01.998 - 01:31:43.994, Speaker A: Thank you. So let's talk about the problem. It's a problem that many of you, especially here in mexico, might feel very close to the flesh. Missing people shatters lives. Missing people shatters family and communities. Where are these missing people? Why is this happening? Wars, conflicts, human rights abuses, natural disasters, organized crime, traffic, drug violence, migration, and other similar issues worldwide, millions have loved ones that left their home one day and never came back. For many, losing a loved one is the most painful experience that they have lived.
01:31:43.994 - 01:32:24.650, Speaker A: I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that. But not knowing what happened to a loved one, that's unbearable. So this project is inspired and dedicated to those who are desperately looking for their loved ones, for answers and for relief. Based on official stats, during this hackathon, 78 people might have gone missing in mexico alone. So let's talk about solutions. A decentralized system to enable anyone to post missing people and match them with found people. Let's dig into the details.
01:32:24.650 - 01:32:54.674, Speaker A: No. So what are the key benefits of of the the approach that we are suggesting? First, inclusivity. It's going to be available worldwide, and it's going to be easy to use. It only needs an email and a password. Two, it's decentralized. A peer to peer database that resolves the lack of comprehensive and reliable statistics in missing people worldwide. Three is immutable.
01:32:54.674 - 01:33:25.470, Speaker A: This database can't be tempered by any government or other parties. Thanks. So here's how the process works. On the one side, you have the seeker, the person that lost a loved one. They access the information and uploads data rather easily. They only need their email and their password and uploading the missing person's photo and personal data. The data is stored in IPFS.
01:33:25.470 - 01:34:20.750, Speaker A: And then this file that is stored in IPFS is stored on polygon as an NFT. Mario will discuss the details a little bit more in depth. On the other side, you have the founder. The founder that finds a person that is potentially missing only needs to frame the potential missing person's face in the camera, using the app to find a match. And so if this person is on the NFTs, there will be a match. So who are the seekers? The seekers are mothers, our fathers, our siblings, our partners, and are all those looking for their loved ones or missing people. And there is a good question that many people have asked us who are the founders? And the founders, we believe, that are nonprofits that are already working on the issue.
01:34:20.750 - 01:34:59.520, Speaker A: They are public servants. They are workers interacting with potential missing people. And they are other seekers. Because no one can understand and empathize the pain of a seeker more than another seeker. What are the use cases? First, vulnerable communities helping kids, migrants, disabled victims of traffic, and vulnerable people get back home and reunite to their loved ones unrecognized deceased. Unfortunately, in many cases, people that are missing might be dead. But still you can help families get certainty, closure, and reunite with the remains of their missing loved ones.
01:34:59.520 - 01:35:47.078, Speaker A: And later on, it can even be used for different approaches like missing pets. So here's a little bit of the tech stack. The custodial wallet structure is what allows any user to access the platform easily with only an email and a password. Since it's not a financial use case, it's not that significant that the wallet is custodial IPFS. We use it to store biometric data and the personal data securely and call it when comparing is needed. We use a seven to 21 smart contract on polygon to store the IPFS data as an NFT on the polygon blockchain. And we use a face comparison AI.
01:35:47.078 - 01:36:26.126, Speaker A: To compare the photos stored on IPFS with the photons caption from the devices of the founders. Well, these are kind of like the main lines of competition that we were in. We use IPFS we believe mean democratizing access to data and justice. Access to justice is a human right and it's a public good. And we're super happy to be entering into that with polygon. And we want to also make user onboarding super easy. And that's why we are allowing people that are non tech people to access this system only with their email and their password.
01:36:26.126 - 01:37:37.238, Speaker A: And I think now we're ready for the demo. Okay, yeah, I'm going to help translate. On this side, we have an NFD minter, and the metadata is going to be stored in the IPFS. We're going to make an example with a pilot, a Mexican f one pilot, CECO Perez. So this data is dummy data. This is the side like when a person is a seeker. In this case, Mario will be the person that is seeking for Czecho.
01:37:37.238 - 01:39:06.330, Speaker A: Perez okay, and it's processor polygon e realmental casas minterun NFT sobrune smart contract goes lower. The custodial wallet interacts with the node, with the polygon node. And with that, we're going to mint the NFT processor aggregamos taron poquito. This is also live on Mainet, by the way, automatic comparison. He used a repeated data, the email, and right now it's not allowing that if you have one email to mint another one. So that's the idea of the operation. Here's the NFT minted on the smart contract.
01:39:06.330 - 01:40:04.490, Speaker A: So 20 seconds ago, there was this new case of a missing person that was registered. And now we're going to see the next process. When a founder meets find a person that might be missing. Como punciona tenemosun modelo in TensorFlow and unmicroservicio. We have a model of a TensorFlow in a microservice studio in quatro sexiones. It splits the face in four sections and it compares it against the data from the NFDS that it's in the Ipfsk. Automatic amended individual knows that el Perfielde de la Persona server gratitude.
01:40:04.490 - 01:40:57.056, Speaker A: Then when it finally matches with a person from the database, it's going to do the match and report the person that is missing. You? Um terminarista mina and Westado poyando kina's presentation. Thank you very much for all the support that he has given us. Diego e otracosa josoro mencanta pensad la CIA solution. Pero creo kento. He is a dev, but I'm also in his sentiment. We love the amazing opportunity that Blockchain might bring.
01:40:57.056 - 01:41:36.290, Speaker A: Pero croquent blockchain de cadono denosome. Viva Mexico. We believe that right now we need to create solutions for real people in real cases. Viva Mexico. That was absolutely wonderful. Please give them a big round of applause. Once more time, please.
01:41:36.290 - 01:41:45.920, Speaker A: All right, now it's time for our last demo for today. Please welcome Project Wuch.
01:41:54.760 - 01:42:17.468, Speaker C: All right, guys. Hello. We're very happy to be here at East Mexico. I'm Paige. I'm here with my team, roy, Temo, Santiago, and KANK. And we are whoosh? So, yeah, we'll just jump into it. So there's a lot of applications that are being built today for existing Web Three users, and that's amazing.
01:42:17.468 - 01:43:07.180, Speaker C: But what about people who are not familiar with private keys, ethereum even maybe, or custodial noncustodial wallets? They don't know what that means. So we decided to create Whoosh, which is a peer to peer payment system built to onboard the next billion users of Web Three. So our goal for creating this application was to make it as simple as possible. So you can see with the onboarding, all you have to do is enter in an email. So, on the backend, what we're using is MagicLink, and that's actually creating the Ethereum address for us. And we'll be using two different tools, magic Link and WorldCoin for the authentication and login process. So, as you can see, we're logging in right now with MagicLink.
01:43:07.180 - 01:43:38.870, Speaker C: And if everything goes to plan, this should take us to we'll see WorldCoin. We're using WorldCoin to make sure that the person who is signing up is indeed a real person and not a bot. I have had personal experiences using different cash apps where there are bots, I'm getting strange requests, things like that. We don't want that. We want a platform where for real people and for everyone. So you can see we've gotten to the World Coin. That's good.
01:43:38.870 - 01:44:06.894, Speaker C: We're going to go ahead and verify. This step will only be necessary if you are signing up for the first time. So we'll give that a go. All right, well, while we're waiting on that so something that's interesting about this application is that we're actually only storing the World Coin IP. Sorry the IP world. Sorry. Hash.
01:44:06.894 - 01:44:19.590, Speaker C: The world. ID hash. There we go. The world ID hash and the Magic Link ethereum address on the back end. And then we're creating that correlation to authenticate the user.
01:44:24.080 - 01:44:25.576, Speaker A: It'S verifying.
01:44:25.768 - 01:44:38.548, Speaker C: Looks like we got our identity confirmed. So we'll move on to where we're going to be creating the username. So I'll pass that off to Temo.
01:44:38.664 - 01:45:20.590, Speaker A: Yeah. So basically for this part of the technology we integrated Lens because we have found that users needs to use tools that have been using for a long time in the Web Two world. The idea, and our idea is to bring people who is not techie as we probably are and they just are already used to social applications like Twitter or something like that. So our idea is use and leverage the technology of Lens to for example, create contacts and actually create a profile that you can find to request for money or share money as well.
01:45:26.220 - 01:45:39.660, Speaker C: This also helps with the user experience because if you've ever sent crypto to an Ethereum address or any address, it can be quite long. So sending it quickly to a username makes it a lot easier for the user.
01:45:40.400 - 01:46:21.220, Speaker A: Yeah, so our goal with this app was to have 1 second a very simple user experience so that anyone, regardless of their knowledge of Web Three can use this app. So we tried to keep it very familiar. There's two main call to actions which is request money and send money. So I'll walk you through first sending money, okay? It's a very familiar experience where you just type in the number that you want to send. And here, as you can see, we have Credits. Okay, you can't see that well, but it says you have five credits left. And this is how we're handling gas.
01:46:21.220 - 01:47:02.210, Speaker A: Instead of explaining to new Web Three users how gas works, we're just calling it Credits and one credit equals one transaction in wish. So next then you select your contact. This account is new so there's no contact. But pretty much next. And here you have the option to add a message. Let's say you're paying for last night's dinner or sending a birthday gift. And you also require a Pin so that not everyone who has access to your phone can just send money and that's sent.
01:47:02.210 - 01:47:56.580, Speaker A: So we basically bring the concept of grades to the Web Two users because here everybody knows what gas is, everybody knows what oracles are and what prices how can rapidly change. But common users, they do not know that and they shouldn't have to know that in order to use the application. So we have come up with this concept of credits which in the end is basically just matic because we have decided to use polygon as a chain. So in the end we just make some conversions to show the user what that amount of matic is going to be in the end for them. So they can understand easily how they can make transactions in their application. Yeah, so the second feature, the second main call to action is request money. So when you request money you don't require credits for this since it's just a message.
01:47:56.580 - 01:48:54.450, Speaker A: You set the amount, select the user and here you could either send a link if the user doesn't use this app or you send a request. If they are a user, you just request it and let's say that they already paid you. Here you could see that the user just sent you $50 and said happy birthday. You could send thanks and optionally write a message. Also one cool feature that we added with Ave was that the money that you have saved here you can simply toggle the switch and you start earning yield. Ken could talk more about that. So the underlying asset is dai in this case and does with that toggle you are able to stake your dai, deposit your dai, lend your die on ave and generate yield.
01:48:54.450 - 01:49:44.830, Speaker A: Basically the way we design this very simple is basically to onboard all the new people in Witri because a lot of people constantly really hate the common banks around the world. So it's not a secret. Basically all the banks around the world doesn't matter about you. So I think web3 have an amazing things. Just look around them. That's amazing. So basically we want everyone can use all the web3 products without nothing about knowledge about web3.
01:49:44.830 - 01:50:42.200, Speaker A: So basically we want to be friendly, efficient and different of the other wallets. Because other wallets has something like MetaMask wallet connect rainbow, it sometimes going to be really Qmfused. So this have an interface very intuitive and easy to use. Sorry. So basically we want to implement this in this part of LATM. Because all the people need to enter to Witri to be complete owner of their assets, of their money and completely all the things that Whitri has. So that's it.
01:50:42.200 - 01:51:26.994, Speaker A: I have to say one last thing actually two, but the first is if you have an idea I think we are actually in life. So if you have an idea and you think you can do a lot of things for a lot of people, you can chase it. Your dreams following don't stop. One day it's going to happen. So I'm not going to talk more about me. But if you can dream it, you can meet it. So the other thing someone knows this vitalik.
01:51:26.994 - 01:52:25.112, Speaker A: We have a present for you. Welcome to Mexico. That's it. My name is Araujo and we are Hush. That all right. Well those are our 212 amazing demos. So please give a big round of applause to all twelve of these finalists.
01:52:25.112 - 01:53:07.786, Speaker A: One more time. And now for the part that all of you been waiting for. I think the most amazing thing about the last twelve demos was that so many people worked on so many incredible problems that are not only just important to them, but also to all of us around the world. And it's just great to see not only that they became from ideas to conception, but also that they all want to continue working on it. And so many of them are already ready to be used right now. That is an incredible thing that I don't think I've seen in any other city. So I want to give a big round of applause to everybody here who made all these amazing projects and to kind of continue this trend, I think we're really doubling down on being able to focus on interesting and important problems.
01:53:07.786 - 01:53:13.980, Speaker A: So without further ado, I'd like to invite Vitalik on stage to talk about ideas for things worth building.
01:53:16.990 - 01:53:22.720, Speaker B: Okay? Hello everyone. How are you today?
01:53:27.010 - 01:53:33.780, Speaker A: Baby channel. Wait, what? Okay.
01:53:40.390 - 01:54:55.686, Speaker B: So great. Thank you. So today what I wanted to talk about is a bit the intersection between some of the things that are happening in the Ethereum space from a very technological point of view. So there's a lot of exciting things happening in Ethereum technology with scaling privacy, a lot of other different topics, and just some ideas for what can happen on the what kinds of things I think might make sense to start building on the application layer. Now, we sometimes think of technology and applications as being separate, but I think it's actually very important to think about them together because improvements to technology can make new kinds of applications possible. Right? They can make applications possible by making them cheaper. Sometimes they can make applications possible by creating new tools, by making it safer to use the Ethereum blockchain, which can make applications more accessible.
01:54:55.686 - 01:55:54.762, Speaker B: And so what are we going to see from our technology in the next few years? And what does this mean for what kinds of things? It makes sense for people to really start building today. So I feel like we've, at least on the Internet and on the Reddit and the Twitter and the Bankless and the Youth Global and all of these lovely forums talked about the merge a lot. So I'm not going to talk about the merge, but it will happen, apparently. It might even happen on Mexican Independence Day, which is yeah. So switch to proof of stake. Great. What comes after the switch to proof of stake? Right? So probably the biggest thing aside from the switch to proof of stake that Ethereum developers are focusing on today and really have been focusing on for a long time is scalability.
01:55:54.762 - 01:56:18.246, Speaker B: Right. So who remembers last year when it cost $5 to send a transaction? Who enjoyed paying $5 to send a transaction? One person did. I did not. Right. So this is a problem. Right. There's not enough space in the Ethereum blockchain today for all of the applications that people wants to make.
01:56:18.246 - 01:57:48.900, Speaker B: And this means that Ethereum is too expensive for people and this is a problem and we have to fix the problem right now. If you look at the charts then sure, today sending a transaction is maybe a few times cheaper than it was last year because last year was a bull market and now the bull market is kind of not a bull market right now. But markets are random, right? They can go in random directions. And so we don't want to kind of rely on markets being in one place or another place for transactions to be cheap. We want transactions to just always be cheap. Right? And the only way to make transactions reliably cheap in the long term is to increase the amount of space on the chain, right? Increase the amount of space that transactions can use now in 2020. I published this document called the Roll Up Centric Roadmap and at the time I think the Ethereum ecosystem was really starting to move in that direction already, right? And the basic idea is to split up the ethereum ecosystem into layer one and layer two, where the job of layer one is to be decentralized, to be safe, to be open, to be censorship resistant, to be permissionless, and to really focus on providing these things and to become more stable and even try to become simpler over time.
01:57:48.900 - 01:58:40.660, Speaker B: And it's the job of layer two protocols to add scalability on top, right? And that was two years ago. And two years ago roll ups were mostly test networks and ideas. But fast forward to today and today there's a lot of scalability projects that are live now, right? So Polygon is sponsoring this and Polygon in its current form, it is a sidechain and so you do have to trust it. But Polygon is also they've been doing all of this excellent work on zero addict, zero knowledge proofs. And so they are going to also have a ZK roll up, which is really amazing right now. Also Arbitrum continuing to move forward, lots of great work, optimism. I hear people from the Optimism team might even be here.
01:58:40.660 - 01:59:30.958, Speaker B: So StarkNet, ZKsync, just all of these projects that are just so much more mature than they were two years ago. Now, scaling through roadmaps is something that has started and it's going to continue. Right? So over here I have these two charts. So the first chart is roll up data space per block, right? So this is how much space there is and there is going to be in the Ethereum blockchain for roll ups to use to put transaction data. So today the amount is fairly low. It's basically roll ups have to compete with all of the other Ethereum applications for space. And so today I think the amount of roll up data on chain is like maybe somewhere between ten and 50 KB.
01:59:30.958 - 02:00:08.030, Speaker B: Maybe a few days more, maybe some days less. I don't know the exact number, but it's not far from that. After the merge, the next big focus of the client teams is likely to be what we call protodank Sharding, which is also called EIP 4844. And this just adds a much larger amount of space for projects to a much larger amount of data on chain that roll ups can use to store transactions. And after protodink sharding, we go up to full dink sharding, right? That's a typo. This is 1 MB. This should be 16 megabytes, right? So a huge amount of space going up by a lot.
02:00:08.030 - 02:00:57.626, Speaker B: Now, in the meantime, also some work happening kind of more quietly, but still important, which is reducing the amount of space required for every transaction on a roll up. Right? So this is just some data for an ERC 20 transfer. So an ERC 20 transfer in a roll up today, 180 bytes. A few months ago, optimism added like this basic form of compression that we call zero byte compression, knocks it down to about 150 signature aggregation, you can knock it down to 128. You need ERC four, three, seven for that better compression, 75. And like, totally amazing compression, 23. Right? So on top of all of this extra space, the amount of space that every transaction needs is slowly kind of in the process of becoming, and is going to become nine times cheaper.
02:00:57.626 - 02:02:39.338, Speaker B: So the conclusion of all of these things put together, right, is that I think we have a lot of good reasons to believe that the Ethereum blockchain will be much cheaper, like more than 100 times cheaper. Building and doing things will be more than 100 times, maybe even 1000 times cheaper than it was last year. So the question for people building applications, right, is I think there's two questions. One question is how can you help the transition? And the second question is, if things are going to be 100 or 1000 times cheaper, what will you be able to build that you cannot build today? Right? So in some of the presentations at the hackathon, I think people are already having exactly the right kind of thoughts in that direction. Right? So, for example, a lot of applications focusing on point of sale and in person payments and in person payments are actually something like they're probably just payments in general, right? They're the earliest application of a blockchain, right? So who here read the Bitcoin White paper? Who here remembers the title of the Bitcoin White paper? Bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system, right? Electronic cash use it to pay people for stuff. Now, this is something that earlier on, I think a lot of people really believed and a lot of people really tried hard to do. Right? So there's these big efforts to try to convince a lot of stores and restaurants in one particular place to all accept Bitcoin.
02:02:39.338 - 02:03:34.082, Speaker B: There were projects trying to convince a lot of online merchants to accept Bitcoin. And with Ethereum, I think this kind of continued at the beginning, but then sometime over the next few years, transaction fees just became way too high. And I feel like the ecosystem kind of quietly mostly gave up on that, right? And I think in fairness, that kind of makes sense, right? Because if you remember, in 2013, one of the biggest arguments that people used for why you as someone in a store or online store or physical store should accept Bitcoin is the fees, right? PayPal charges $0.29 plus 2.9%, and even more if it's international credit cards charge even more. And here scriptocurrency Bitcoin $0.01 transaction fees, right? So it worked in 2013, but then in 2017, instead of the transaction fee being $0.01,
02:03:34.082 - 02:04:25.780, Speaker B: it was $50. And so it did not work anymore. Right. But with scaling, we are looking at transaction fees going back down to maybe even lower. Today, we're not in 2013, today we're in 2022. And the size of the Ethereum community, the size of the crypto space, also bitcoin people doing, I think, some similar work with the Lightning Network as well, the size of the space, the amount of developers that are there that can actually build really good and user friendly solutions just so much more. Right? So I think it actually makes sense to try to try to do in person payments and online payments again.
02:04:25.780 - 02:06:07.634, Speaker B: So that's just one example, right? But the question that you should ask is what other applications are not possible today or are not possible in 2021, but they are possible in a world where transactions are 100 times cheaper. So that's one thing that we can build that as a developer you can look at, right? The other thing you can look at as a developer is how might you participate in this transition? Right? So in here, if you look at the chart closely, there's a couple of these very specific technologies that I mentioned, right? So, ERC, 4337, I'll talk about it a bit later, but it's account abstraction. It's this kind of standard on top of Ethereum that gives wallet designers a lot more freedom to choose, basically how wallets do their authentication. So you don't have to have one key, you can have multiple keys, you can have different signature algorithms, you can have recovery, you can do a lot of things. And one of the nice things that you can do with it is a signature aggregation, right? So you can take a large number of signatures, combine them into one signature, and you just save a huge amount of data, right? So this is something that can make a big difference, but it's something that people have to actually do and it's something that people have to implement wallets for. There are already a couple of teams trying to build wallets that support, ERC four, three, seven. But you can build more, right? And you can join those teams and you can build your own.
02:06:07.634 - 02:07:36.640, Speaker B: It's, I think, an area where there's still a lot more room for people to participate, better compression for roll ups. Right? So what's the difference between where we are now, 154 bytes and going down to 75 and even going down to 23 if. You're part of a roll up team or you want to contribute to a roll up, this is one of those things that actually could be very valuable to contribute software for nodes in a world that has some of these scalability upgrades, right? So when the Ethereum blockchain has a lot more data, when it becomes more scalable, users are going to need to have better software for being able to access and process all of this data. And this will not be something that the blockchain, the Ethereum node, will be able to do by itself. Right? So this extra software has to be built, and there are a lot of good projects that are building it. But this is also a place where there could be more, right? So this is the first category of, I think, how to think about what you can build, right? The scaling transition is happening and will and will continue to happen. How can you help the transition? And once we have the transition, what kinds of things that you cannot build today will you be able to build a couple of years in the future? Those are the things that it makes sense to start building today.
02:07:36.640 - 02:08:39.310, Speaker B: Zero knowledge proofs. So, zero knowledge proofs are this very powerful technology that has become very big in the Ethereum ecosystem over the last five years. Basically, it's a way to cryptographically prove that some statement about some piece of data is correct without revealing the information about why that statement is true. So you can say, for example, that I have an Ethereum address and that Ethereum address has a valid proof of humanity profile, but you don't have to reveal which proof of humanity profile you have. Right. So you can have applications that increase security by adding these guarantees into the application, but at the same time preserve privacy. Now, privacy is actually only one use case of ZK Snarks, right? The other use case of ZK scenarios that somehow the exact same technology gives us is scalability.
02:08:39.310 - 02:08:54.360, Speaker B: And for scalability, zkSNARKs are already being used in ZK rollups today, right? So polygon. Polygon. Hermes, ZK, rollup. Yay. Come on, clap for the sponsor. They're here. Okay.
02:08:54.360 - 02:10:30.550, Speaker B: Now they're not the only one, right? So ZKsync doing amazing work. Scroll doing amazing work. The Ethereum foundations team with Barry WhiteHat, also doing amazing work. StarkNet with Cairo, also doing amazing work. So a lot of work that's happening on ZK for scalability and ZK for privacy now, from the point of view of an application developer, right? So my perspective on this is that the ZK for Snarks for scalability stuff, that's like mostly protocol level and mostly infrastructure level, right? So it will happen in ZK rollups, and you don't actually need to worry too much about it, but it just will make everything that you do more secure and cheaper. ZK Snarks for privacy are a bit different, right? Because as an application designer, you have to think about your application's privacy situation, right? The privacy needs of every application are different, and there isn't a way to magically provide privacy for everything, right? There are some pretty fundamental technical reasons why you can't basically, you can't hide all the data from everyone, because in order to make a transaction with the data, you have to have the data, right? That's like the easiest way to think about it. And so for every application, you have this question of, well, who is going to have the data and how are you going to use these proofs, and who has the right to make what changes to the data? How are you encrypting things? How are you hashing things? And all of this.
02:10:30.550 - 02:11:55.554, Speaker B: Now, some interesting examples of this privacy preserving proof of humanity is like a very simple one, right? If you want to create an application, one very simple example of this might be that let's say you want people to be able to have some conference and you want people to be able to sign up and buy tickets to that conference, but you want to limit your ticket purchases to one per person, right? But at the same time, you also don't want to reveal everyone's information publicly on chain. How do you do all of those things at the same time? Well, you can make a zero knowledge proof that says in order to buy a ticket, you have to provide a proof. And that proof proves that you have a proof of humanity profile. And at the same time, it reveals this kind of extra secret called a nullifier. And if you make two proofs with the same profile, they're going to have the same nullifier, right? And so the nullifier by itself does not reveal anything, but it still stops you from using the same profile more than once. So this is something, I actually have a post on my blog. I wrote this a couple of months about some very specific ways about how you use this technology.
02:11:55.554 - 02:13:02.274, Speaker B: But it is powerful, right? And if you're building an application, you probably do have privacy needs, and it's important to think about those privacy needs. And ZK Snarks are just a very powerful technology for dealing with privacy issues. Sometimes there are privacy solutions that are kind of simpler and you don't need ZK Snarks. So one thing that I mentioned publicly about a week ago is stealth, right? So if you want to send someone an NFT and they have a public address, like, you don't have to send it to their public address directly. You can generate a stealth address and you can generate an address that they control, but nobody aside from them knows that they control that address. And so it's a little bit more low tech, but it's also another way to just leak a little bit less information out to the public so everyone can see. So privacy, another really important category of applications is the ethereum Identity Ecosystem.
02:13:02.274 - 02:14:40.726, Speaker B: And this is actually one of my answers to the question of what can you build when Ethereum is cheaper that you cannot build when Ethereum is expensive. So I think I've become convinced that aside from money and financial applications, things to do with identity are probably the second biggest category of applications on Ethereum, right? And I think the reason for this is pretty clear, right? Because Ethereum and blockchains by themselves, in order to interact with them at all, you need to already have an identity, right? So who here has an Ethereum wallet? Okay? Who here has a PGP key? See? Not that many people, right? So this is one of these kind of double edged swords of blockchains and crypto, right? So back in the 1990s, there were a lot of people that had these very idealistic ideas, right, that we have encryption now and we can protect privacy and we can communicate with each other and we don't need to have corporations and governments snoop on everything. And then they created all of this amazing software and everyone could generate their own key. Anyone could send messages encrypted to other people's keys, but it just never really went very far, right? Like, this is a group of developers, but if I asked this at a non technical feel, you know, there would still be a lot of people raising hands for an Ethereum wallet, but probably almost no one raising their hands for a PGP key, right?
02:14:40.828 - 02:14:41.334, Speaker A: Why?
02:14:41.452 - 02:15:58.800, Speaker B: Well, PGP keys, they're like a very difficult network effect to start, right? You have one application and no one else is using the application, and so you're only really going to use it if your friends are using it already. And it's just very difficult to get off the ground. Now, you could, of course, argue like, hey, we believe in freedom, we believe in privacy, we believe in these wonderful ideologies and try to kind of convince people that way. But it didn't go very far. Now, instead, we have blockchains, right? And with blockchains, we have money and we have incentives, and we have people wanting to trade, like, $3 million monkeys. Now, there are big downsides to these, but one of the upsides is that people definitely have incentives, right? And so it did create this incentive for even very normal people. Like, just people who are not interested, aren't kind of very deeply involved, interested in kind of ideology and freedom and privacy, just more regular people that just want to save money, not lose their money to hyperinflation, be able to send money internationally, just do very simple things.
02:15:58.800 - 02:17:39.614, Speaker B: Or just to do these things, you have to create a wallet. And once you have that wallet, you can use that wallet for so many other things, right? So one of my dreams here is that we can kind of use this as a path to improving how identity works on the Internet in general, right? So one of the problems with identity on the internet as it exists today is that it's very centralized, right? You sign in with Google, sign in with Facebook and sign in with Twitter, and you just have one company that controls your account. They see everything that you do, they can control everything that you and you don't actually get that much in exchange, right? So one argument that people sometimes make is that, oh, it's good that a company controls your account because, well, if you accidentally screw up, you accidentally lose your key, you can call customer service and the company will help you get your account back. This is actually often not true, right? In reality, I've talked to lots of people who have lost their accounts, and it's actually very hard to get your account back. So what if instead, we could use Ethereum accounts and we can use Ethereum accounts to log into services and even log into centralized Web Two services. So instead of sign in with Google, we have sign in with Ethereum. So this is something that the Ethereum Foundation actually started pushing kind of pretty hard last year, gave a grant to Spruce, and a lot of other people in the Ethereum Ecosystem are really pushing on this.
02:17:39.614 - 02:18:21.230, Speaker B: And there's more and more applications that are starting to just let you sign in with an Ethereum account. And especially if you want to target people, the Ethereum Ecosystem and the Crypto community, it's very convenient. Now, how do you recover your account, right? Let's say you have an Ethereum account, and either your account gets stolen or you lose your account. Today, we're not very good at this right now. There are backups and there are seed phrases and all of these things. But what happens if your account gets stolen, right? It doesn't really help. And sometimes people are careless with their backups.
02:18:21.230 - 02:18:56.310, Speaker B: Sometimes really bad things still happen. Sometimes people are lazy. So one of the ideas that I've been a big fan of for a long time is this idea of social recovery wallets, right? Basically, the idea is that you as a user, would choose some number of recovery contacts. This could be institutions, it could be family, it could be friends. You choose who they are. It could even be other wallets that you control. And if you choose some number of them, then let's say, for example, you choose seven recovery contacts.
02:18:56.310 - 02:19:52.682, Speaker B: You might need four of them, or you might want five of them to be able to recover your account. If you lose your account right now, you can even make it privacy preserving. Like, you can make it so that you don't reveal to the chain who your recovery contacts are. And your recovery contacts don't even have to know who each other are, right? So it's actually pretty strong against collusion. So this could be done and it could work quite well. But in order to do this, you have to have an account that is a smart contract wallet, right? So you can't use a regular account, you have to use a smart contract wallet. Now, how can we make it easy to use a smart contract wallet to access your funds? Well, ERC 4337, right? This is a kind of protocol that sits on top of Ethereum that's designed to make it really easy to do this.
02:19:52.682 - 02:20:47.758, Speaker B: So what do we have now? Right, you have your in Ethereum account, which is an account and that is like an identity. If he wants to recover your account, you can make it be a smart contract wallet. If he wants to use your account, you can sign in with it. Now, generally in the centralized world, you have a username, right? And in Ethereum we have a username, you have ENS. You can prove things about your account, right? So you can prove that if you want to prove that you are some actual real account and that you're not a spammer, there's a lot of things that you can prove. You can prove that your account just sent at least one transaction on Ethereum. You can prove that you have some proof of humanity profile, you can prove that you have a Pope, you can prove that you have some minimum balance, you can prove that you participated in some event, you can even zero knowledge prove all of these things.
02:20:47.758 - 02:21:48.720, Speaker B: Right? So between all of these different applications together, I actually think that we have a pretty powerful identity layer already on Ethereum. And all that we really need to do is just build better versions of all of these different pieces on the stack and start getting them to talk to each other more and really start connecting things together much more. And this is also something that I think as a builder you can absolutely participate in. Right? So that's a few examples of things that you can build. There's lots of other things that I think are important. So public goods funding is important and I think there's a lot of good ideas around making better quadratic funding applications, better ways to do credit assignments, to figure out exactly all of the different participants that are responsible for making some public good happen. So not just the person who claims credit at the end, but kind of the entire tree that led up to them.
02:21:48.720 - 02:22:45.458, Speaker B: There are better ways to do governance for Dows, also important, better kind of meta applications like applications that other applications can talk to, right? So I think there's this big long list of things that are worth making. But I also think that another thing that's important to realize here is that the technology is making it easier to build these things in a way that was not true two years ago, right? Like two years ago we did not have scalability and you could not practically do any of this. Two years ago, zero knowledge proof technology was just not as good. It was much more difficult to use. And so two years ago, it was just much more difficult to build anything privacy preserving. Two years ago, we did not have many parts of this stack. And when you only have one part of the stack, it's very difficult to do other things.
02:22:45.458 - 02:23:16.238, Speaker B: But when you have some version of all parts of the stack, then it becomes much easier to build even better versions of any part of the stack. Right. So technology is improving, and I think it's possible for any of you to help participate in making this effort of making the technology better and more secure and more reliable, cheaper and more accessible, but also really start thinking about, well, what kinds of new applications will all of this and new technology make possible?
02:23:16.364 - 02:23:54.500, Speaker A: It thank you. That basically is a plan for the next five ETH global hackathons. We're going to get all of you back to build all those things.

Hopefully in the next 24 hours. We'll notify you and for all of you if you missed this and you're going to catch this live stream later, you can head over to Youthgobal.com
02:28:27.580 - 02:29:08.320, Speaker A: Showcase and go to your own project page and see what prizes you've won. So congratulations to all of you for participating and winning all these amazing prizes. And a quick note on the prize delivery is that we are going to verify that everything was done over the course of this weekend and nobody cheated. So in the next two weeks or ten days is when we'll be delivering prizes. So keep an eye out for an email next week that'll share the next steps and everything will be actually sent on the 31st. All right, so before we close this thing and enjoy the rest of the Sunday, I want to say a few thank yous. There's a lot of people that make this event possible and there's a lot of work that goes into it behind the scenes.
02:29:08.320 - 02:29:40.928, Speaker A: So I want to make sure I give a big shout out to everybody here. And first up, it's all of you hackers that spent all this time working on really cool things. So please give yourself a big round of applause. Want to thank all of our amazing judges for taking all of the morning to talk to amazing teams and give feedback. And without this, we would not actually be able to do the demos. All of our amazing mentors and volunteers that were here all along, 24/7, making sure you can get help, you are never worried about anything you have to take care of. So thank you so much to all these amazing people and of course our amazing speakers.
02:29:40.928 - 02:30:22.432, Speaker A: The workshops, the talks, the panels, everything we've done. Without their work, we would not be able to actually educate more people in this space. So congratulations and so many amazing partners that are here that are not only just supporting these events, making sure everybody gets to learn, but also the ones that are making it possible for us to get better overall together. I'm going to give a special shout out to Chewie. Without him, we would not be able to do this event, so he's been an amazing filler in our community. And Shaka, so these are two amazing volunteers that really made sure that everybody has a really amazing experience and thank you so much for all their help. And a big last shout out to the rest of the ETH Global Team.
02:30:22.432 - 02:30:34.100, Speaker A: Without them making sure everything is on track, we would not be here. So thank you. Chloe, donnish. Kevin K. Kevin Ivan cree uchimini. Anna, moaz. Luke, Emily, Andrew and Jacob.
02:30:34.100 - 02:30:58.792, Speaker A: And one last thing. So, twelve teams came here. We call them our finalists and they all demoed. And we talked about all the prizes that everybody won, but what do we call them? Finalists. ETH Global events are not designed to be a competition. Our goal is to really highlight interesting things that people are excited about and really make sure that we get to present them and move everybody forward. So we call them finalists because there is no 1st, 2nd, third at any of our events.
02:30:58.792 - 02:31:25.620, Speaker A: Everybody that presented here is officially first and there are twelve first place winners. And as part of being a finalist, they're all going to be getting $500 per member from the Equal Team. So congratulations to all of you. And we're now at a close. So before we wrap everything off and go to the after party. This would not be an ETH global event if we don't talk about what's next. So without further ado, we're excited to announce our next sackathon in two weeks called ETH Online.
02:31:25.620 - 02:32:04.924, Speaker A: This is going to be our biggest online event that's going to take place all of September. We encourage all of you to check it out and sign up for ETH Online. And after that, we'll be joining all of you in Bogota right before DevCon for ETH bogota on October 17 9th. Then we head over to San Francisco for Eat San Francisco on November 4 and fourth to 6th. And we're going to end the year with our last event, eat India in Bangalore on December 2. So we're looking forward to meeting all of you from different parts of the world in your hometown and everywhere else. And with that, let's enjoy the rest of our evening.
02:32:04.924 - 02:32:34.396, Speaker A: There's going to be an after party by Lance Protocol in the other room. I want to thank all of you for coming. Thank you for being at Eat Mexico. And there's going to be a pinata on that side. And as a quick note, if all the finalists can just quickly come here to take a quick photo, we would really appreciate that. So all the teams that just presented, please meet us on stage. If I spend it on girls you.
02:32:34.418 - 02:32:41.770, Speaker C: Don'T want to be, I like me. Never really know why like me. You don't ever step off that close to it or.
