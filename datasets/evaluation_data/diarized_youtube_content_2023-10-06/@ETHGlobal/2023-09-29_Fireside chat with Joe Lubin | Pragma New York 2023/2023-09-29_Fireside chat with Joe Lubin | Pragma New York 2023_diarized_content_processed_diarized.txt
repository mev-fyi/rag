00:00:07.210 - 00:00:38.410, Speaker A: Up next, I want to bring up Joe Lubin. You may know him as the founder of Consensus and co founder of Ethereum. And we're going to talk about a lot of things that are happening in this space from like a very high level on how we're thinking about the opportunity of this Ethereum ecosystem and overall how all of you can get involved if you are not directly developer on Ethereum. We're going to cover a bunch of these things and sort of what Consensus is doing. And you may have heard of a lot of their products like MetaMask and Infuria. We're going to talk about what the future of those products looks like. And without further ado, let's welcome Joe on stage.
00:00:44.350 - 00:00:47.158, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Thanks Kotik.
00:00:47.334 - 00:01:00.640, Speaker A: I'm excited to have another chat with you here in public. A lot of my questions are very high level, so we're going to keep things simple and easy. So let's start off with the SEC.
00:01:02.370 - 00:01:03.550, Speaker B: Good joke.
00:01:04.530 - 00:01:21.570, Speaker A: No, but actually, seriously, how do you think about this crypto versus government battle? We've seen a lot of that heat up in the last few months and something we've been seeing over the last decade. Any kind of long term thoughts on where that nets out or how do you sort of see that evolve?
00:01:21.650 - 00:01:30.220, Speaker B: Yeah, so to keep it simple, we were more worried a few months ago, we are less concerned now.
00:01:30.590 - 00:01:31.514, Speaker A: Why is that?
00:01:31.632 - 00:02:27.558, Speaker B: So the executive branch in the US is interested in slowing or killing crypto for national security reasons. Essentially the US. Runs the world, so they believe, and they run the world through intermediaries, especially financial intermediaries. Our technology is all about having a new trust foundation and removing the need for intermediaries in many cases or right sizing the amount of power and extraction of value of intermediaries in other cases. And that's effectively incompatible with the way the leaders of the United States prefer to run things. Not incompatible with the American experiment, I think, which favors things like free speech entrepreneurs.
00:02:27.574 - 00:02:28.858, Speaker A: They also have their hunters to make.
00:02:28.864 - 00:03:23.758, Speaker B: Things better, open markets, free market capitalism even, which we don't really have in the United States. They're going to do what they normally do when any new technology emerges that they have to capture. That they feel they have to capture. So internet, web, cryptography, SSL altogether. Exactly. So they'll overreach as much as they can and the legislative branch of government will split 50 50 to some degree and they'll battle it out a little bit. And we're seeing clear heads prevail in the judiciary, as one would expect.
00:03:23.758 - 00:04:37.270, Speaker B: And so we'll get unbiased reads of the laws and scrutiny of behavior of different agencies. The Supreme Court is looking like they're not pleased with how certain agencies are behaving. So there's this notion of deference to agencies, meaning, hey, the agencies are secs, et cetera, are experts, they must be good people. They obviously know what they're doing. We're going to give them leeway to make rules. And the Supreme Court is recently pushing back on deference and sort of maybe eliminating that approach to how the judiciary deals with them. So the Ripple XRP ruling was very favorable to centralized exchanges and wallets and anybody who cares about doing things with tokens.
00:04:37.270 - 00:05:48.038, Speaker B: We were concerned that there might be FUD rulings. Gary would wave his arm and declare all tokens officially illegal, according to the SEC. And that would be a bit problematic for our business at MetaMask. It wouldn't be catastrophic because we're in nearly 200 countries around the world and so we would lose a decent chunk of our revenue, but we would continue to operate and we'd emphasize other places so bottom can as an ecosystem, we can continue to operate globally and in the US. Kind of unfettered, with much more attention to rigor around decentralizing things. Because when things are decentralized, then the securities Exchange and Centralization Control Commission, that's what they're there for. Centralization is something that needs to be regulated.
00:05:48.038 - 00:06:04.320, Speaker B: And as long as we design as we should and execute as we should in our ecosystem, then the SEC can't do that much in a sane world, that's help.
00:06:07.030 - 00:06:31.820, Speaker A: Do you think that this was just the play that had to be in this timeline? Like it just had to take these many years to figure out how people sort of get more comfortable with understanding what's going on at the higher levels of the government? Or is it that is just a one off case that the Ripple case sort of kind of won the case law here on what the definitions are, but it may not actually mean that everything else is fine too.
00:06:34.270 - 00:07:22.780, Speaker B: So the timeline is interesting. I and others felt at the beginning of this adventure that we're doing some things that are going to lead to a clash of civilizations. One based on centralized top down command and control trust, the other based on this new invention, decentralized trust. And they're the incumbents and they've got the guns, but we got the people. And the plan, if there was a plan, was to keep our heads down and build and build and build and see how far we can get before they really take notice. And thanks. Thank you, Sam Bank and Freedom and others.
00:07:22.780 - 00:07:39.600, Speaker B: So CFI essentially made things a little more difficult for us, especially recently. Yes, exactly. And so going forward, I think.
00:07:41.810 - 00:07:42.174, Speaker A: We.
00:07:42.212 - 00:08:28.350, Speaker B: Knew the clash would come. We knew we had to land the technology in the social legal systems around the world and it'll land differently in the US. Versus Russia versus China versus North Korea. North Korea loves the technology, obviously for their own purposes. And I think the way it ultimately unfolds is that we recognize that the old world has cohorts that need to live their lives in the way that they're comfortable. And we need infrastructure that enables that for another. Who knows how many decades.
00:08:28.350 - 00:09:02.140, Speaker B: And at the same time, our technology can make the traditional world operate better, offer more options or opportunities. And we should be free to choose to live our lives more, doing things in the rigorously decentralized space if we want to. And so those two pathways of existence should operate in parallel and they'll interoperate. And I think it's going to be fine.
00:09:03.310 - 00:09:38.230, Speaker A: I think that's a very refreshing perspective. Usually it's a zero sum kind of statement that we usually hear from both sides. This is something I think you've spoken in the past about as well, which is, hey, maybe the technology should not be super regulated, but the use cases should be. And this is in a way, hoping for that world where, yes, the protocol can live without too many hard coded rules, but somebody wants to build an exchange on top, they should maybe meet certain requirements where they are. And seems like you're, in a way, forcing for that world to be actually more possible.
00:09:38.380 - 00:10:27.430, Speaker B: Yeah. So a guy named Bill Hughes, our head of policy at Consensus, wrote a really crisp article on CoinDesk, I think it was called Money Crypto versus Tech Crypto, something like that. Money crypto is CFI. Money crypto is the exploiters. Money crypto is the projects that use decentralization as a marketing term or tactic. Tech crypto is a group of builders who use decentralization as a design principle, progressive, moving towards rigorous decentralization. And so CFI money crypto absolutely should be regulated.
00:10:27.430 - 00:11:11.890, Speaker B: It has served some good purposes, maybe. So it's certainly onboarded a lot more people, a lot faster to our ecosystem. That's maybe good, maybe it was bad in retrospect because we are on an exponential growth curve. Essentially. Builders come in new wave after wave of innovation, enables us to grow our ecosystem and usability and scalability, affordable use cases. And around that exponential, we've got this thing going NUMS full on the way. So a lot of irrational exuberance, a lot of pain, a lot of rational exuberance, a lot of pain.
00:11:11.890 - 00:11:40.714, Speaker B: And maybe we could have done without that. And how do we do without that? We would have need regulator support. So where were they when we needed them? Now they're here and they're trying to shut down tech innovation. So tech crypto, it's software, it's free speech. Don't regulate innovation. That's dumb. Regulate use cases.
00:11:40.842 - 00:12:23.818, Speaker A: Couldn't agree more. This is amazing. Well, I think it does deserve a massive round of applause. Well, speaking of serenity, when Ethereum got started, did you ever imagine where we would be right now in terms of the scale? And kind of I'm looking at things like, okay, well, we finally kind of managed to make the merge happen. And one of the biggest, if not the biggest, large scale software upgrade in the history of software. How do you kind of feel about where we are now in this space? And I guess I'm curious to hear what you think is sort of the next milestone that you personally are excited about for the evolution of Ethereum as.
00:12:23.824 - 00:12:51.118, Speaker B: A protocol in the history of running software with live monetary rails. So it's even more extreme. So when I read in 2011 the Bitcoin white paper, I assumed we would get here and much further. I assumed it would take a lot longer with the Bitcoin virtual machine, which is based on Ford.
00:12:51.134 - 00:12:52.082, Speaker A: Sorry, what's that?
00:12:52.216 - 00:13:35.090, Speaker B: And does very few things. When I met Vitalik and read the white paper I was really excited because, hey, now software developers can build stuff with tools similar to what they're used to and it was clear that there would be a clash of civilizations. It was clear to me that the technology was it had characteristics of antifragility decentralization and it was going to be powerful enough to win in the end. When I got into Bitcoin, I wasn't certain that Bitcoin was going to survive.
00:13:36.550 - 00:13:40.578, Speaker A: Because of the values or because you weren't sure that the propagation won't happen.
00:13:40.664 - 00:14:24.078, Speaker B: It was really fringe and it was attacked. And when it demonstrated its antifragility a couple of times, maybe three times, and I was like, okay, we're good. And so I never had concerns about Ethereum. I was past that, those initial doubts. And it's about landing it in different nation states. And what I said before, it is happening agonizingly slowly and astonishingly quickly. At the same time, it depends on your perspective.
00:14:24.254 - 00:14:24.834, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:14:24.952 - 00:15:05.690, Speaker B: So we couldn't have gone faster. I don't think we needed to build in layers. We've got a trust foundation, we got a decentralized democratized finance layer. We've got incursion crossing the chasm into mainstream culture with NFTs that's disintermediation of various intermediaries. There's a lot more intermediaries out there. We're going to ping them off one at a time when we start building the application layer apps. And that I believe, depends on the next enabling layer.
00:15:05.690 - 00:15:17.530, Speaker B: The next enabling layer, in my opinion, is something that I've been saying for five years is here already. And that's essentially attestations decentralized identity.
00:15:17.610 - 00:15:18.914, Speaker A: That's not what I thought he would say.
00:15:18.952 - 00:15:20.574, Speaker B: And reputation systems.
00:15:20.702 - 00:15:21.138, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:15:21.224 - 00:16:12.574, Speaker B: So we've already got a lot of block space and that's going to sort itself out. So we're modularizing, we're sub modularizing. Scalability affordability is coming. We can now build applications that would have either broke Ethereum or would have been too expensive on layer one. Ethereum and so many more use cases are now economically viable. But we need applications that are built with the user in the center and in control of everything they should be in control of. And so we need to build primitives that enable people to assemble their own social graphs and attract applications, publish subscribe to different social networks.
00:16:12.574 - 00:16:26.840, Speaker B: And I think we're on the precipice of as a company I recently spoke to said their goal is to destroy trillions of dollars of social network value.
00:16:27.610 - 00:16:30.120, Speaker A: Destroy being the operating work? Exactly.
00:16:30.590 - 00:16:37.580, Speaker B: Microphone obliterate a bunch of companies and replace it with a whole lot of social graphs that we're in control of.
00:16:38.110 - 00:16:51.566, Speaker A: I think this is a very unique tick because I thought you would say it's still the throughput and the cost per transaction that matters. Not that I disagree with what you said. No, it's like you don't have to fall for this exactly.
00:16:51.668 - 00:17:21.000, Speaker B: Easier MateStation service. We've got one called Verax on linear. Our layer two ZKE EVM. We need to incentivize people to establish the root of their identity, DIDs or some other forms and then start firing attestations at each other. We're going to start attesting to. You work at consensus, you work on this team, you maybe achieved something.
00:17:22.570 - 00:17:33.680, Speaker A: I think maybe for the audience here, it'd be useful to understand what is a good framing of thinking about Attestations on chain. Everybody thinks it's like a toy or just like a nice to have, but what's a good opportunity and a framing for this.
00:17:36.370 - 00:18:21.182, Speaker B: As the EAS team recently stated, we fire attestations at each other all day on Twitter and those are just proof of any event. I could say, yes, that was a great post, Karthik. And that's me from my identity saying something about something else. And if Elon doesn't like what I said, get rid of that Attestation. If he really doesn't like me, I'm gone. If he doesn't like you, and so we can't have that sort of thing. So those Attestations are already timestamped, but Elon could sort of adjust the timeline too.
00:18:21.182 - 00:18:37.086, Speaker B: And so we want Attestations that can't be expunged by anybody and identities that can't be expunged by anybody. And so that's why you need a registry for this very simple primitive of Attestations on Ethereum and other networks.
00:18:37.278 - 00:18:43.810, Speaker A: And you think fundamentally this is what enables more applications altogether or more consumer facing applications.
00:18:45.590 - 00:18:56.758, Speaker B: Applications altogether. But I think it's a massive unlock to bring developers in to start building cool little doo hickeys that you can add to your social graph because now.
00:18:56.764 - 00:19:18.926, Speaker A: You can bridge anything that's off chain and you kind of have knocka proof that this is actually the case. Interesting. Well, speaking of kind of the evolution on another thing, let's talk about consensus. What was kind of the founding reason when you started the company and what would you say the motto and the goal is now? And kind of how has that changed over time?
00:19:19.108 - 00:19:41.922, Speaker B: So I worked on the Ethereum project for a year and setting up the Ethereum Foundation during that period. And a lot of people were shy of the United States at that point because the United States liked to put people in jail for creating their own currency.
00:19:42.066 - 00:19:43.558, Speaker A: If you think things are bad now.
00:19:43.644 - 00:19:54.362, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it was just really uncertain at that point. So there were some maybe criminal projects, liberty Reserve or something like that.
00:19:54.416 - 00:19:55.114, Speaker A: You remember that?
00:19:55.152 - 00:20:38.220, Speaker B: Yeah. So we didn't want the United States to have the FBI waiting for us when we landed JFK and tackle us to the Tarmac and make a big spectacle of the Ethereum project. And so we set up shop in a country that appreciated free speech, freedom, democracy, things like that, privacy a little more than the United States did. So that was Switzerland. That was a safe and smart good move at that point in time. And it was a time when these were serious issues. There was real fear around setting things up.
00:20:38.220 - 00:21:04.494, Speaker B: So consensus started a year in essentially to continue the vision and mission of Ethereum. And we didn't know what that meant. Essentially, it meant to do whatever it took to foster adoption. We did splashy things. Our marketing was about ecosystem, not consensus. We couldn't we wanted to build products. We incubated a lot of projects.
00:21:04.494 - 00:21:16.946, Speaker B: We invested a lot of product, product invested in a lot of projects. And it was a very immature technology. And so all these products, you had.
00:21:16.968 - 00:21:19.254, Speaker A: To prove what would be possible for everybody else to see.
00:21:19.292 - 00:21:37.610, Speaker B: Yeah. So there was no developer tools. There was no ecosystem, really, for a long time. And so all that had to bootstrap itself. And we played a part in bootstrapping it with things like truffle back in the truffle infira MetaMask diligence.
00:21:40.130 - 00:21:43.390, Speaker A: Is that still the goal now or what's already?
00:21:43.460 - 00:22:17.190, Speaker B: So the goal is really to bring into reality a much more, maybe ubiquitous decentralized future. And so it's about enabling people and organizations of any size to have economic and political agency. So it's to achieve the paradigm shift to decentralization.
00:22:19.230 - 00:22:30.314, Speaker A: When you go and tell this to a potential enterprise, what's the reaction for why would they want this? Or should they actually care?
00:22:30.512 - 00:22:40.074, Speaker B: Well, we used to use the term enterprise to mean something like Morgan or Microsoft. Now it means something like compound or Aave.
00:22:40.202 - 00:22:44.980, Speaker A: Oh, that's a really good yeah, it just clicked. You're right.
00:22:48.950 - 00:23:40.082, Speaker B: So we speak appropriately to whomever we're speaking, and there's a lot of value propositions in what we do. And we don't need radical decentralization for every use case. Radical decentralization has to happen at the base trust layer. We need a platform on which organizations of any size, including the United States and China, can interoperate, even if they're in the middle of disputes or wars. Even supply chains should keep moving if they want to create a little treaty. Any nation state treaties are kind of bullshit because you can just apparently withdraw from a treaty anytime you want.
00:23:40.216 - 00:23:41.666, Speaker A: I did not know that.
00:23:41.848 - 00:24:48.200, Speaker B: It happens all the time, especially the weapons ones. So if you have treaties written on an Apolitical network that nobody can really control, then you could put billions of dollars of stake at stake. There might actually be utility for the United Nations at some point where it can be an adjudicator of certain things that have real financial import to people. So we need base trust layer, and then Dows and other things can be less decentralized. And if a supply chain, if Walmart wants their own blockchain, their own layer two or layer three or something like that, it doesn't need to be as decentralized. But it's really nice that it can have essentially the full, the ability to the full security guarantee of Ethereum. And I know we need to get more decentralized in the L Two and eventually L Three space, but that'll happen.
00:24:49.130 - 00:25:14.354, Speaker A: I think that's a really good way to think about sort of what the next decade could look like. Consensus has given us so many amazing products that kind of help bootstrap a lot of where we are now. So I guess I'm curious to hear about maybe more updates on how things are going for certain these products. So I want to kind of learn more about what's happening with MetaMask and Infuria. You kind of talk about the new ZK sync layer two. Let's dive into each of those and give us updates on where they're going.
00:25:14.392 - 00:26:25.890, Speaker B: Yeah. So taking a high level view of this, for us, it was about standing up the ecosystem. So we needed to build tools that developers could use and do valuable things with. We stood up in Fura initially because we had a whole bunch of teams building their own test nets inside of Consensus. And so some smart, cool people said, why don't we have our own testnet? And then we offered it to the world before DevCon two. So somewhere in there and that became a heavily used resource because before that you had to basically run a node and tell the users, a billion users of your application, to download the Ethereum client and sync it for 24 hours or however long it took, and then you could use the application. So that was obviously not so viable.
00:26:25.890 - 00:27:29.740, Speaker B: And Infura grew up constantly trying to stay up to speed because the changes were complicated and fast. So we wanted to decentralize Infira early on, but we were more concerned about performance and effectively we were comfortable paying the AWS bills for the industry for quite a while to just grow the industry. Infura is now progressively decentralizing itself. So we have a bunch of launch partners and it's going to happen real soon that Infura becomes a Federated network initially. So permissioned because we need to make sure everything works, sort of load balancing at the RPC level and we think that'll get launched pretty soon. Small number of months.
00:27:30.050 - 00:27:32.270, Speaker A: That's a big update here.
00:27:32.420 - 00:27:53.858, Speaker B: It's a big update, not an official update. So very fuzzy language there soon. And then I think that might last about six months, maybe longer. We've got protocol design and our crypto economics team figuring out how to properly decentralize all of that.
00:27:53.944 - 00:28:00.150, Speaker A: So the value of decentralizing Ethereum being not one single instance is routing all the traffic.
00:28:00.490 - 00:28:34.610, Speaker B: Yeah, so it'll be more robust, but same level of performance. So we know we can do that now. We can achieve the same level of performance, which was kind of a blocker up to this point. So with respect to MetaMask, again, product market fit, we benefited from having lots of users and an intense focus on security. So we just an astonishingly brilliant deep team. We've been working on our Snaps plugin architecture for lots of years.
00:28:34.680 - 00:28:35.934, Speaker A: It just went live recently.
00:28:35.982 - 00:29:36.562, Speaker B: Just went live last Monday, I believe. And Snaps essentially enables anybody to write. We did a piece of code that you can load at, runtime into your MetaMask, and you can access any other protocol. So you can put your Bitcoin, your Doge, your Solana in your MetaMask now your Saul, and you can message people. App developers can message their users. And there are transaction inspection tools and security tools that are already out. So we got 34 Snaps that we've diligenced so that we've security audited and it's still a permissioned system for a little while, it will go fully permissionless.
00:29:36.562 - 00:30:20.546, Speaker B: And so with both Infura and MetaMask progressively decentralizing, we're nearly at the point where we're not the gatekeepers at all, where any developer can launch their own front end as a Snap and launch their own back end in the decentralized infura protocol called Decentralized Infrastructure Network Din. And that will, I believe, lead to a flurry of developer activity and just accelerate case of it's very easy to.
00:30:20.568 - 00:30:28.678, Speaker A: Understand and follow how inferior gets decentralized. But in the case of MetaMask, it's the plugin infrastructure that lets people add abilities and that's the piece that's becoming more open.
00:30:28.764 - 00:30:42.730, Speaker B: So that's one element of progressive decentralization. The other element is enabling MetaMask core to be either fully governed or more heavily governed in a decentralized fashion.
00:30:43.550 - 00:30:44.058, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:30:44.144 - 00:31:18.630, Speaker B: I'll have you all. It's dangerous, though, because there's a lot of side effects. Yeah, if the wrong people, the software supply chain is potentially vulnerable. The kill chain, we're working with lots of security tools that are trying to set up posts on the kill chain to protect users from different kinds of exploits. And so if our priority is security, then we have to decentralize the core very carefully.
00:31:18.970 - 00:31:19.622, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:31:19.756 - 00:31:48.160, Speaker B: But decentralizing anybody can essentially declare MetaMask their product because their Snap is in there. I can build an application on macOS and that's all people see, really, my application for that moment that they're paying attention to it.
00:31:49.010 - 00:32:09.186, Speaker A: I want to kind of combine one of my other questions with one interesting thing that you did say is you're also working on an AZK roll up as consensus. Sort of what made that kind of the thing to focus on for you and kind of combining this with the second question, which is do you kind of see hundreds of layer two showing up or do you kind of see some conversions in the near term?
00:32:09.378 - 00:32:52.820, Speaker B: So we do a lot of R and D. We do a lot of work on things like formal verification, a lot of protocol work. We've written some important EIPS had a huge role in the merge and other forks. And we've been doing ZK work for a number of years. And our head of R D said, hey, we can do this. So that's why we did it. And we made the decision to do it, which took resources from other things that we were doing because it was critically important to establish a beachhead in the layer two space, layer three space.
00:32:52.820 - 00:33:58.538, Speaker B: I considered it part of the evolution of the Ethereum protocol to have presence in that region of the Ethereum protocol, the extended Metropolitan Ethereum protocol. And there'll be certain kinds of transactions that happen at layer one in the decentralized future and there'll be lots of layer twos and there'll be lots of layer threes and fours, et cetera. I think block space will break out into different categories, different levels of security. There might be regionalization, perhaps switzerland doesn't like certain data to move across its borders, so we're going to need to pay attention to things like that. And these different layer two ecosystems are built on different technologies, similar technology. I don't think anybody wins on performance speed table stakes. Yeah.
00:33:58.538 - 00:34:48.410, Speaker B: And I think we're going to all zero in on pretty good performance for the use cases that we need support. I think we went on philosophy ethos and just the kinds of applications that set up shop in your ecosystem and so I was very confident that Polygon would set up a whole bunch of layer twos. They're already doing that with Immutable. They're going to have a whole bunch of game layer threes on that. And I figured that like Coinbase, we needed our own home technology and home network and doesn't mean we're not going to do lots of stuff on other networks. We do a lot of work on the Palm NFT network, we do a little bit of work on Ethereum and so we'll keep doing that.
00:34:48.560 - 00:34:52.220, Speaker A: Awesome. I'm going to switch gears a little.
00:34:52.590 - 00:34:57.420, Speaker B: And Linear is progressively decentralizing, like everything we do.
00:34:57.870 - 00:34:59.482, Speaker A: We're on track for all three of these products.
00:34:59.536 - 00:35:51.258, Speaker B: Yeah, we're working really hard on that. We made that decision for regulatory reasons that we delayed that early on. We were prioritizing other things, but we decided, hey, we should really do what we can to decentralize, approver and also work with other teams to the extent that we can to evolve the layer two space to be more like the layer one space where you've got a whole bunch of protocol teams that are doing the same thing competing. Cooperating. So ideally it gets a little more homogeneous in terms of access to this block space with shared sequencers and stuff like that. Right.
00:35:51.344 - 00:35:53.194, Speaker A: Everything still settles on Ethereum, but there's.
00:35:53.242 - 00:35:58.926, Speaker B: Multiple ways to yeah, and we needed to have a voice at layer two, so that's why we did well, sort.
00:35:58.948 - 00:36:06.900, Speaker A: Of coming back to regulation again. Do you think we are closer to having network states.
00:36:08.390 - 00:36:28.006, Speaker B: Yes. So Zuzulu is a cool example even though they're not really using much technology. I think you can get a ZK Zuzlu passport and we've got lots of dows we've got so you define just.
00:36:28.028 - 00:36:32.438, Speaker A: Overall dows as network states in this definition or is there needs to be a notion of an actual no, it's physical.
00:36:32.534 - 00:37:33.050, Speaker B: Those are just components that need to be elements of a network state. We got voting systems, we've got identity systems coming online, gitcoin passport and there will be a flurry of Attestations DIDs and VCs Verifiable credentials coming out really soon in a lot of contexts. We've got lots of ways of managing treasury for Dao, we've got account abstraction which is going to be really important. So whether it's formerly Gnosis safe or other tools and treasury management built on top of that. So there's a lot of pieces. Governance is very hard in the old way and we do a terrible job on it in both corporate contexts and government contexts and we also do a terrible job in the crypto dow.
00:37:33.130 - 00:37:34.558, Speaker A: We're definitely covering that soon.
00:37:34.644 - 00:38:07.160, Speaker B: Exactly. But we have the potential to codify things, to improve layer by layer and we're doing it in a pretty necessarily open, transparent and broad way where a lot of people can see, inspect directly, act directly and be fully involved in the things that they care about.
00:38:08.010 - 00:38:14.620, Speaker A: So short term, some bumps, but overall we do see individual network states kind of become more and more common.
00:38:15.630 - 00:38:22.400, Speaker B: It's going to be hard. Governance is hard. A lot of people involved, it makes it difficult.
00:38:23.410 - 00:38:26.190, Speaker A: If only we can just not listen to them.
00:38:26.260 - 00:38:44.466, Speaker B: Yeah, the old technique was fewer people, such as just like put all those people down there, we'll tell them that we're going to take care of them and we'll make the decisions and we'll disseminate whatever value we want to. And now we can disseminate value in real time and everybody can watch in.
00:38:44.488 - 00:38:48.066, Speaker A: Real time and participate and actually make a change.
00:38:48.248 - 00:38:49.720, Speaker B: So maybe it'll go fast.
00:38:50.090 - 00:38:50.866, Speaker A: Fingers crossed.
00:38:50.898 - 00:38:51.640, Speaker B: We'll see.
00:38:52.090 - 00:39:18.590, Speaker A: Well, my last question to you is as I was kind of thinking about what was an interesting way to kind of ask you this. I realized that most of us have seen ups and downs of crypto but you've seen literally all of them having been here from the beginning. So I guess I'm curious about having been here for over a decade now. How do you kind of generally stay motivated or kind of what gives you that hope that we are going to get to where we want it to be and what we originally thought of and any practical advice for people to continue building in this space?
00:39:18.740 - 00:40:17.634, Speaker B: Well, it's fun. A lot of great people, the companies I'm involved with have wonderful, spectacular people that I enjoy seeing every day. The world is breaking so it's important that the world not break. Well, it's important that the. World break in appropriate ways and evolve to be a better world. There's a new hot technology on the block. AI that will, if not properly married to decentralized protocol technology and decentralized governance, will likely lead to some weird singularity where somebody gathers a whole lot of talent and a whole lot of compute and data and storage bandwidth, et cetera, and they create the most powerful tool in human history for centralizing power.
00:40:17.634 - 00:40:52.330, Speaker B: That would suck. And so I've been spending a lot of time looking at projects, talking to people about how to make sure that the AI world is built in a decentralized fashion. So open source AI is doing a pretty good job. I don't know that it wins in the end without figuring out how to necessarily rely on decentralization.
00:40:54.910 - 00:41:11.050, Speaker A: I don't have any volume questions because this is going to go into way too many deeper topics, but looks like not waiting for us to be doomed is a pretty motivational thing. And using that as a way to keep this whole ecosystem going is not a bad strategy.
00:41:11.130 - 00:41:14.962, Speaker B: That's one good reason, but it's awesome. It's a privilege.
00:41:14.986 - 00:41:26.422, Speaker A: Glitch I couldn't agree more. I think just seeing all the amazing things that have come out on a weekly basis for the last ten years, it still blows my mind that that's still happening. So thank you for kind of helping start a lot of this, and I really appreciate you taking the time.
00:41:26.476 - 00:41:28.326, Speaker B: You too. You've been thank you.
00:41:28.348 - 00:41:31.080, Speaker A: Doing great. Friends. Awesome.
