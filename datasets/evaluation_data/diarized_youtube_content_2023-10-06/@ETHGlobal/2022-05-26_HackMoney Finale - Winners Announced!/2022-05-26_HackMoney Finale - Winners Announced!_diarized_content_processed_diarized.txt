00:00:08.410 - 00:00:44.086, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening everybody. My name is Kartik, one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the Hack Money finale. So ETH Global is an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem, and we do this by primarily running hackathons and summits. And this is the last day of Hack Money. So we're going to summarize how the last few weeks were for all of you here and then go into all the good stuff, which is the amazing demos and the prizes. So we ran this event with hackathons and the summit.
00:00:44.086 - 00:01:32.758, Speaker A: So for the summit, we actually had a kickoff summit and a summit on Superfluid reactor program and kind of super happy that we got to see some brand new product announcements as well as some really insightful conversations on how we think future payments is going to be. And then going over to the hackathon side. This has been an amazing event. We have over 1205 hackers participating in this hackathon. They came in from 76 different countries spanning 18 different time zones, and we kind of put everybody on a map to see where they were from. And it's just incredible to see so much representation from all different continents around the world. In addition to that, we also saw 47 ecosystem partners and 246 ecosystem mentors who were here this entire time, helping all of the attendees get unblocked and get help on various technical projects.
00:01:32.758 - 00:02:05.090, Speaker A: And we're giving away $300,000 in prizes. We're going to go into all of those details today. And before we go into that, I just want to take a quick second and really kind of congratulate and say that we had 214 submissions come out of this hackathon. This is absolutely incredible. Officially, this makes it our biggest event ever. We're super excited to see so many DFI focused hacks. Everything that we're going to see today and that came out of this event was a DeFi hack and can't wait to show you all some of the incredible projects.
00:02:05.090 - 00:03:16.362, Speaker A: And in addition to all of that, we had so much support from all these amazing protocols that were here this entire time, helping out people and offering amazing prizes. I want to quickly shout out superfluid WorldCoin uniswap Grants program wallet connect IPFS filecoin ave grant staO dYdX babylon finance polygon volts olympus cksync swing unstoppable domains and coinbase wallet tempest gearbox lyra the graph AP wine badger uma compound EPNS transact covalent Nervos gnosis Safe Oasis Foundation arbitram Teller SPHERON connect fuel odos Maker chainstack chain Link urine finance baku redstone gamma capitalist secured finance blockchain space Upstart and Quantstamp. All these 46 amazing partners are just absolutely incredible to work with. And we're going to talk about all the prizes that everybody won. So let's go into the hackathon. So we had 214 submissions from this event. They all submitted three days ago on Sunday and the next two days were judging and going through everything that came out of it.
00:03:16.362 - 00:03:54.502, Speaker A: We saw some incredible obvious themes here and we're going to see a lot of that here in these demos. There's a lot of amazing lending and options related hacks, especially with integrating NFTs. We saw a lot of creativity around L2s and zero knowledge proofs being integrated. There's a lot of stuff around asset management, integrations and analytics. And also the most common thing that we saw was yield hacking and optimization and being able to see that anywhere from multiple chains on L two S. So we're going to see some of those highlights here and through all of the judging process from those 200 projects, we landed on ten finalists. So we're going to talk about who they are.
00:03:54.502 - 00:04:45.462, Speaker A: And in no particular order, I want to congratulate Whip Whiteo. Okvault btfdca EVIX yield index, hashbase polypust JPEGs and text These are our ten finalists. They are going to be coming on this live stream now and demoing what they've built and just want to give them a big round of applause here for being some of the amazing projects that everybody got excited about. So we're going to bring them on. But before we sort of go and kick off with the first demo here, want to take a quick second and just really thank all of these 200 plus teams. Just because you were not a finalist does not mean you were not good enough. The goal for this live stream is to highlight some really interesting creative ideas that our judges saw as part of that event and for us to actually highlight some of the things that we think are going to be anywhere from trends to important topics for building in the future.
00:04:45.462 - 00:05:34.758, Speaker A: So to all of the 204 teams here, please don't take this as like a defeat. We really want you to continue building. If you need any help, whether it's more feedback or you want to talk to some people or want to get more specific feedback from some of the judges, please send us a note on Discord or email, and we'll be happy to kind of help you make this project that you worked on for the last few weeks a reality. And we're here to help and make sure that you continue to stay excited about everything that you built. In addition to that, there's also going to be opportunities for different grant programs to continue getting funding for building and continuing to build what you're doing. So there's also opportunities for that and we'll be reaching out to you all over email. And for those of you who are interested, you can now head over to Showcase Ethglobal.com
00:05:34.758 - 00:06:04.180, Speaker A: to see a list of every project that came out of it, including the ten finalists we're going to see today. So with that, we're going to bring on these ten teams back to back to do demos of what they built. We're going to bring them on in this order. So we'll start off with Text and then JPEGs and then Btfdca, mito and EVIX. So without further ado, let's bring on our very first demo for today. Please welcome Nina from text. Whenever you're ready, feel free to get started.
00:06:10.630 - 00:06:12.994, Speaker B: Hi, can you hear me?
00:06:13.192 - 00:06:14.498, Speaker A: Everything is great.
00:06:14.664 - 00:06:31.560, Speaker B: Okay, so hi, I'm Nina, and I'm from Team Text. And today I'll be presenting text the Ferris Dex for Traders. Just a second, I'll share my screen.
00:06:37.690 - 00:06:38.440, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:06:40.090 - 00:07:29.638, Speaker B: So Ted is we are building the fairest decks for traders. We have a team of five members and our passion is to create a fair trading environment. So that's what led us to build. Tex is a MEB resistant decks for swapping tokens without any hidden slippages. MEB is also known as the Miner or Maximum Extractable Value, and it's essentially the additional profit a Miner can make by arbitrarily excluding or reordering transactions within a block. So to prevent me beyond Text, we use timelock puzzles and zero knowledge proof. Now, timelock puzzles require large computational resources and the computation itself is very challenging.
00:07:29.638 - 00:08:24.154, Speaker B: So this timelock solution itself wasn't very practical to use it prior text. So we developed a new scheme called PBDE by combining Sigma Protocol and Cksnarc to solve the timeout puzzles and prove the validity within 5 seconds. Next for our demo, we'll show how the swap process works on Text. So swapping is the same as in any other DEXes, but there is a slight difference of encrypting the transactions on these front end. As you'll see for this demo, we forked uniswap's front end and smart contract. And Pvde is the key feature that we've developed for Text. So I'm going to try to swap one uni to matic it delays.
00:08:24.154 - 00:08:44.080, Speaker B: For the price, we'll click swap and confirm swap. Sorry, there seems to be a delay. I'll try that one more time.
00:08:46.130 - 00:08:46.880, Speaker A: It.
00:08:57.710 - 00:09:46.460, Speaker B: So quick swap and then confirm swap and then sign the transaction on MetaMask. Now the transaction is being encrypted with a symmetric key generated from timelock puzzles so that miners are not able to see the contents of it before they determine the transaction order. So this prevents them from manipulating the transactions and then the transactions are executed. And while this is happening, the user is generating the proof of timelock puzzles and the encryption using PBTE. And once this transaction gets submitted, the user can check their order number for the transaction. In this case, it's three. Next we'll see the test codes for this demo step by step.
00:09:46.460 - 00:10:02.474, Speaker B: So once Text receives the transaction and the proof, it needs to verify the proof. And if this is true, it determines the order of the transaction and saves.
00:10:02.522 - 00:10:16.660, Speaker A: It on the recorder contracting for it to pop up.
00:10:24.250 - 00:11:38.780, Speaker B: And then Text also needs to find a symmetric key by solving the time puzzle. This takes around 8 seconds. Then it decrypts the transaction. Now, before the execution, let's bring the encrypted transactions and see the orders on the recorded contract sends the decrypted transaction to the router contract for execution. Now that both contracts have received everything, the recorder contract and the router contract will talk to each other and make sure that the order is correct. Just waiting for the batch to pop up. The network can be unstable sometimes, so just waiting for it to pop up.
00:11:38.780 - 00:12:44.970, Speaker B: So in this case, because the network is unstable, we will show the transaction that we are tested right before the SEMA. So we'll check that the transactions have been actually executed in the right order. Here on the left screen, the top shows the order of the transactions on the recorder contract and the bottom shows the transaction hash on the swap contract. And I will search the block number on polygon scan and you can see all the transactions within the block. And the order of the transaction goes from bottom up. So if we compare the transaction hash with the order number and the address, you can see on polygon scan that the transactions have been executed in the right order. So, for example, order number zero with the transaction hash zero X nine have been executed first.
00:12:44.970 - 00:13:18.340, Speaker B: And order number 10 XD hash number has been executed next. And order number 20 XE have been executed last. So, to end, our next step is to continue building text and partner with L2 and to implement our PBDE on ZK roll ups to prevent mud. Thank you so much for listening. And if you have any questions, you can contact us at theRadius XYZ. Thank you.
00:13:21.290 - 00:13:46.938, Speaker A: Amazing. Thanks so much. Nina, this has been an awesome demo and you were able to really make this work live. I know there were some difficulties, but the fact that we got to see this thing and the fact that you were able to make this definitively not go through reordering is incredible. So congrats. And we hope to see this go live very soon. All right, next up, we have our second team and that is Project JPEGs.
00:13:46.938 - 00:13:50.320, Speaker A: So Aditya, whenever you're ready, feel free to get started with your demo.
00:14:01.750 - 00:14:03.106, Speaker C: Can you see my screen?
00:14:03.288 - 00:14:04.020, Speaker A: Yes.
00:14:08.550 - 00:14:31.210, Speaker C: Hello everyone. I'm Aditya and I have created JPEGs Finance for the hack money. JPEGs is the first on chain NFT options trading platform. Problem with today's NFTs are it has less user base, mostly because of the size of the collection. Blue chip NFTs are expensive. No passive income to be earned from NFTs. And there is a huge gap between NFTs and DeFi.
00:14:31.210 - 00:15:11.152, Speaker C: With the help of JPEGs, I'm trying to bridge the gap between NFTs and DeFi. Give me 1 second. There are a lot of people sitting on the sideline who wants to speculate on NFTs. But because of the high entry cost barrier, they are not able to do so. And also, there are holders of blue chip NFTs. Who wants to speculate on NFTs but they don't want to sell their rare NFTs. Introducing JPEGs JPEGs solves all this problem by creating a derivative market where instead of selling your precious NFTs, you can trade options.
00:15:11.152 - 00:15:37.690, Speaker C: JPEGs provide mass exposure to blue chip NFTs by reducing the entry cost barrier. And the most important of all, you can hedge your expensive NFTs by purchasing put options. Here is the description for the same. Here is a little market overview. We can see that the trading volume of NFTs are going down. That is mostly because the floor prices are going through the roof. Let's dive into the demo first and we'll get back to the PPT later.
00:15:37.690 - 00:15:59.136, Speaker C: So here's the UI of our application. Initially we'll be supporting three vaults. Let's explore the board Apr club. So similar to any option trade, there will be option buyer and there will be option seller. So let's go with the option buyer first. And let's say option buyer wants to purchase one option. The premium of it is 0.2
00:15:59.136 - 00:16:30.510, Speaker C: width. This premium is being said by the optimistic Oracle. Let's preview the deposit and let's click on deposit waiting for the transaction to pop up. Once we confirm the transaction, let me explain you the architecture of the vault. So we have decided to have two expiries in a month. Each expiry corresponds to one epoch. There will be statistically decided strike prices and the user can choose one of strike prices and can choose to buy or sell options on the same.
00:16:30.510 - 00:17:02.000, Speaker C: The settlement of this options will be done in a European style. Now the deposit is successful. Let's go to the option seller side. Let's say option seller choose 125 with strike prices and wants to lock this NFT and sell call options. We'll deposit NFT preview. Then when we click deposit waiting for the transaction to pop up. Now upon confirming this NFT will be logged into the vault until the option expiry.
00:17:02.000 - 00:17:36.156, Speaker C: Now let me explain you the settlement process. For now we'll be going forward with manual settlement. But once Chingling price feeds for NFTs are ready, we'll be integrating the same and the Oracle will take care of all the settlement process. Now once this thing is confirmed, I'll show you what the NFT log will look like. Waiting for it to confirm now. Yeah now the deposit is successful and when you see here you can see this particular NFD is being logged inside the vault. The strike price of 125 bet expiry of 30th May and I am the owner.
00:17:36.156 - 00:18:01.944, Speaker C: So you can see the owner information. If you go into the portfolio page you will see that all the transactions are being recorded. And since the option hasn't expired yet, you cannot claim this time. Since we'll be going with forward with the manual settlement, let's expire the epoch and settle this thing. We'll be settling this with 124 E waiting for the transaction to pop up. Sometimes it takes time.
00:18:02.142 - 00:18:02.888, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:03.054 - 00:19:00.904, Speaker C: Now once we confirm this thing I'll explain to you what is happening here. So we are settling it with 124 E which is less than the strike price. That means the option has expired out of the money and in this case option seller can reclaim their NFTs without depositing anything into the back to the vault. On the other hand, if we would have expired it above the strike price then the option would have expired in the money and in that case option buyer can exercise the option. In that case option seller will have to deposit the difference of settlement price and strike price back into the vault and that will be distributed on a proportionate basis to all the option buyers. Now when we have expired the epoch now let's settle this thing clicking on settle and waiting for the transaction to pop up. It takes time sometimes, but yeah, now upon clicking confirm we are waiting for it to confirm.
00:19:00.904 - 00:19:06.220, Speaker C: Till then we can have a look at different transactions. Waiting for it to confirm.
00:19:07.600 - 00:19:08.156, Speaker A: Okay?
00:19:08.258 - 00:19:38.250, Speaker C: Till then we can come here and look into this. Meanwhile that is happening. We have integrated WorldCoin for the same so that the early users can claim an NFD and the holder of those NFDS will get 20% off on trading fees for the same. Now we'll check whether the settlement has completed or not. Yes, it has completed. Upon refreshing we will see that the user can claim the NFT. Now upon clicking claim NFT a pop up will happen.
00:19:38.250 - 00:20:21.408, Speaker C: Yeah, it has happened. Now sometimes it takes time waiting for it to confirm one transaction is going through. Upon confirmation of this thing the NFTs will be reclaimed back to the user. Waiting for the transaction to confirm. Yeah, now it is confirmed. Upon refreshing we will see that the option transaction has been wiped off. And if you go back to the option seller side you can see that the NFT has been reclaimed by the user.
00:20:21.408 - 00:20:55.184, Speaker C: So by this demo I'm trying to tell is this simple option reading will look like on NFTs. Let's go back to the presentation. This is what the timeline looks like. We'll be going forward with three vaults initially and the call options architecture. We are parallel working on the put options, time put options and we'll make it live. Soon we'll be integrating the support for put options. Soon we'll be adding keep on adding more vaults as per community proposals and once everything has happened we'll be collaborating with other NFT cross D five protocols for the same.
00:20:55.184 - 00:21:05.570, Speaker C: So this is what the expansion plan looks like and if you want to get in touch with us you can connect with us on this social profiles. That's pretty much it from my end. Thank you for watching.
00:21:07.000 - 00:21:24.424, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much for that demo. I'm glad that you were able to make this work there any issues and this is awesome. We'll hope to see that go live as well. And with that, we are ready for our next team, and that is BTF DCA. So whenever you're ready, feel free to get started. Thanks.
00:21:24.424 - 00:21:26.488, Speaker A: Editing. Hi.
00:21:26.574 - 00:21:28.410, Speaker E: Let me just share my screen.
00:21:31.680 - 00:21:32.430, Speaker D: Cool.
00:21:33.360 - 00:22:04.608, Speaker E: So, hello, everyone. I'm Nifient. I'm the creator of Btfta. And what is Btftca? It's a product that lets you buy crypto the smart way, that is, through dollar cost averaging. We have a straight to the point UIUX, which you just ready, set, and you go. And it's built leveraging the benefits of Superfluid and polygon. And for those that are not aware of what dollar cost averaging is, it's an investment strategy where you periodically buy an asset in constant amounts.
00:22:04.608 - 00:22:28.030, Speaker E: And this is perfect for crypto and for hoddlers. So it lets you just navigate smoothly through the volatility that the markets have. So let me show you how this works. So, we'll go into demo. Okay, so this is the UI. This is the product. I'm just going to go and connect my wallet here.
00:22:32.180 - 00:22:32.784, Speaker A: Cool.
00:22:32.902 - 00:23:05.860, Speaker E: I'm connected. And I simply say that, hey, I want to buy a constant amount of my fake dix token, let's say five fake dix token, and I want to buy this asset, which is the ETH Global token. And I want to do this every day. So I simply set five, and I click Btfdca, and MetaMask pop up comes up, and I'll just approve this transaction. And I wait a bit, and boom, that's it. Congrats, man. You've just btfta.
00:23:05.860 - 00:23:45.770, Speaker E: And so this means that tomorrow I'll be getting my Efglobal X token in my wallet. And as I mentioned, this is built on top of superfluid. So I want to show you that what I just did actually happened. So, Superfluid, you have the console and you have a dashboard, and we can see the money getting sent to our smart contract. So we can see here, this is the balance that's going down. And if I refresh, because it takes a little bit, we'll see here the flow rate. So, meaning that the money, the five FIC dix, is getting streamed per day.
00:23:45.770 - 00:23:54.090, Speaker E: And then tomorrow, coming here to the wallet, I'll be able to get paid.
00:23:56.700 - 00:23:57.496, Speaker D: What else?
00:23:57.598 - 00:24:41.348, Speaker E: So, going back here, how does this all work? As I mentioned, it's powered by superfluid. It uses the Superfluid constant flow agreements, which allows you to stream money into a smart contract, and the instant distribution agreements, which are used to redistribute the money to the investors. It's running on polygon, which means that we have low cost transactions, and we're doing the swaps through uniswap, going a little bit more technical. This is how it works. And here we also have some of the things that I would have liked to have time to build, but didn't have, unfortunately. So the users with their wallets connect to the front end. From the front end, they simply click Btfdca.
00:24:41.348 - 00:25:24.276, Speaker E: That starts a superfluid constant flow agreement, which puts the money into our smart contract. Then every day we go into uniswap and we do the swap and then we return back money to our investors. So, yeah, what's next? So, this was a project built for the hackathon. So there's quite a bit of things that need to be polished and make this production ready. Want to find users for this, so all of that. And then in the future, more assets, maybe DCA, everything, more integrations with the DeFi protocols and reinvesting into vaults and so on. And so, if you're interested, let me know.
00:25:24.276 - 00:25:26.470, Speaker E: And thanks for your time.
00:25:27.800 - 00:25:47.788, Speaker A: Amazing. Thanks for that demo. This is such a simple and a cool utility that can be used in so many different ways. So I'm glad that you kind of made this through and presented it to everybody. Also, for clarification, we don't have a global token, so it's just a demo. Well, thank you so much. And with that, we are ready for our next demo.
00:25:47.788 - 00:26:18.430, Speaker A: Next up is Roman from Widow Router. Roman, whenever you're ready. Hi everyone, I'm Roman, and I'm super excited to present the Widow router with you today, which is a cross chain liquidity migration protocol. Let me jump straight into the demo. So, here I am on the Beefy finance website, and this is a FRAX Usdclp vault. I would like to deposit into this vault. It lives on the Phantom chain.
00:26:18.430 - 00:26:52.322, Speaker A: The problem is that I don't have anything inside my Phantom wallet. There are no tokens and only a little dust of FTM. That is not enough to cover the deposit fee. On the other hand, I do have something on my avalanche wallet. So what I could do is I could move or bridge my USDC from avalanche over to phantom. I would buy FTM tokens somewhere and then deposit into this vault using this zap. Alternatively, I can do all of that in a single step using wider router.
00:26:52.322 - 00:27:31.486, Speaker A: Let me show you how that works. So, this is the page we've built for this hackathon. It's live on this URL, as well as all our contracts are live on mainnet. So you can go and check it out yourself. So, my wallet is connected as from, I'll select my USDC on avalanche and as the two, I'll go to vaults and I'll select FRAX USDC LP vault by BF finance on Phantom. Let's say I want to route 5%. I have approved already.
00:27:31.486 - 00:28:29.284, Speaker A: So I'll just click route, I confirm while the transaction is being mined, I'll move on with my demo and we'll get back here later on. To further represent the extensibility of this system, we've also built a wider router widget that DApps can integrate into their website. Let me show you an example of how this looks on the Year Finance website. I'm personally a huge fan of this team. So here I am on Year finance, and when I switch to ethereum, I have a deposit in the USDC vault on Ethereum. I have deposited into this vault in the past. But the APY went down recently.
00:28:29.284 - 00:28:58.368, Speaker A: So I'd like to move it elsewhere. And I have discovered this vault on Phantom that I am particularly interested in at this moment. And it's this dive vault that is currently offering 4%. So what I would like to do is I would like to move my USDC from Ethereum all the way into this Die. Hold on, Phantom. That requires withdrawing on Ethereum bridging to Phantom, exchanging from USDC into Die and then depositing.
00:28:58.464 - 00:28:59.588, Speaker F: Let me show you how you can.
00:28:59.594 - 00:29:25.756, Speaker A: Do all of that in a single transaction. And you won't need any FTM for that. So, first I'll install the widget into this site. Super simple, just a few lines of code. The buttons are green now, so they are controlled by wider. I can click deposit on this die vault. This little wider router pop up comes up.
00:29:25.756 - 00:30:00.394, Speaker A: I can select my USDC, my YV USDC from the Ethereum yearn USDC vault. Let's say I want to move 50% of it. I have approved already. So I'll just click deposit. I need to switch my network to Ethereum as that's where the source transaction happens. And I hit confirm this transaction is going to be mines now. So I'll just move on with my presentation.
00:30:00.394 - 00:30:42.806, Speaker A: I will get back here in a second. To sum up, wider router is a crosschain liquidity migrations protocol. It supports deposits, withdrawals and migrations across any chain, any protocol, or any L2. As part of this hackathon, we've added support for few vaults from Yearn and BFI and we would like to integrate more. So if you are a protocol and you would like to receive deposits from different chains or different L2s, make sure to reach out. And let's now check the state of the transaction. So this is the first transaction, USDC from Avalanche into Phantom.
00:30:42.806 - 00:31:13.246, Speaker A: I have successfully received the LP token of beefy. I can open up the transactions. This is the one on Avalanche and then there is one on Phantom. And I can also see this one. This transaction from Ethereum to Phantom is still being mined. The one on Ethereum has finished successfully. The other one is still being mined.
00:31:13.246 - 00:31:30.982, Speaker A: And I'm sure it's going to finish pretty quickly. So that was wider router. Thank you very much for listening. Amazing. Well, thank you so much for doing that demo and really kind of making that actually being production ready. You deployed on mainnet. This is incredible.
00:31:30.982 - 00:31:47.374, Speaker A: So hopefully we all get to try this out after this live stream ends. And congrats. Thank you. All right, next up, we have Lee from EVIX. So whenever you're ready, feel free to get started. Great.
00:31:47.412 - 00:31:48.270, Speaker D: Can you hear me?
00:31:48.420 - 00:31:50.286, Speaker A: Yes. Awesome. Thank you.
00:31:50.308 - 00:31:51.230, Speaker D: Cardik.
00:31:56.150 - 00:31:56.898, Speaker A: Hi, everyone.
00:31:56.984 - 00:32:00.158, Speaker D: This is EVIX, an on chain volatility trading protocol.
00:32:00.334 - 00:32:01.166, Speaker A: My name is Lee.
00:32:01.198 - 00:32:40.480, Speaker D: I'm from San Francisco. I'm a software engineer and a former volatility and equity trader and I worked on this solo. So what is EVIX and why is it needed? Currently, there isn't an easy way to gain pure exposure to implied volatility levels in the DeFi ecosystem. This is a critical piece of a mature derivatives market, allowing for traders and market makers to hedge option exposures and speculate on future changes in volatility in traditional equity markets. There's the VIX index, which is calculated from a weighted average of listed option prices. In the DFI world, thanks to the existence of perpetual option like swaps, we can more easily calculate an onchain implied volatility level. For example, with open Squeef ETH, implied volatility is simply the square root of 365 times the daily funding rate.
00:32:41.010 - 00:32:42.254, Speaker A: So how does it work?
00:32:42.372 - 00:33:19.500, Speaker D: EVIX is a single product to gain exposure to onchain implied volatility without the need to dynamically change positions. V zero of the index is calculated using squeak funding rates. However, in the future it will include other data sources such as Uniswap V three pools and other onchain and option markets. Traders deposit collateral on the protocol and from there they can buy or sell the EVIX perpetual swap or can provide liquidity in the EVIX trading pool to earn fees on traded volume. Funding is then paid or received on open positions based on the difference between the current index level and current pool price to maintain a peg between the pool and the index. And from there we'll go on to our demo swap over.
00:33:23.390 - 00:33:23.718, Speaker A: Great.
00:33:23.744 - 00:33:59.906, Speaker D: So now we can see we are connected to the EVIX protocol and we are ready to deposit some collateral and start doing some trading. So we want to deposit 250,000 USDC and while we wait for that to confirm, we can go check out the Provide Liquidity screen. We can see that the current pool price is 117 and the index is actually marked a little higher at 125. The current pool fee rate is 0.5% and there's already a million USDC and eight and a half thousand units of EVIX in the pool. But we're more interested in trading. So let's go over to the trade window.
00:33:59.906 - 00:34:26.180, Speaker D: We can see our 250,000 collateral has flowed through. With the current initial margin rate of 50%, we have a maximum trade size of 500,000 and we think volatility is going to go up in the future, but we're not quite sure how much. So we'll do a smaller trade and buy 50,000 USDC worth of edx. So once that transaction flows through, we should see ourselves with a long position, and I'll give that a second.
00:34:32.310 - 00:34:33.106, Speaker A: It awesome.
00:34:33.208 - 00:35:01.200, Speaker D: So we can see our transaction has flowed through. We have a long position of around 400 units of evex with an opening price of $123, and our collateral has gone down by half of that 50,000. Next up, I'm going to trigger a couple of things manually that normally would be happening automatically. And first, I want to. Trigger an update to our index level. So what that's going to do is pull the funding outputs from the squeak contract and do a new calculation of our index and update that index level in the protocol. So let's trigger that.
00:35:01.200 - 00:35:21.458, Speaker D: And once that flows through, I want to settle funding on our position and depending on whether the index is above or below, great. So we can see that the new index level is 146. And given that the pool price is below that, we would expect to receive funding on our long position.
00:35:21.544 - 00:35:25.470, Speaker A: So let's settle the funding and if.
00:35:25.480 - 00:35:46.460, Speaker D: We go back to the trade window shortly, we should see our accrued funding flow through and awesome. So we can see that we have made around 7000 USDC on funding on this position, given that Volatility has gone up as we expected it to. And now we're ready to exit out of our position. So let's close our long position.
00:35:52.370 - 00:35:52.734, Speaker A: And.
00:35:52.772 - 00:36:01.950, Speaker D: We can see that our collateral has come back plus the 7000 USDC that we made on our funding. Awesome. So now we'll go back to presentation.
00:36:06.930 - 00:36:07.342, Speaker A: Great.
00:36:07.396 - 00:36:40.986, Speaker D: So a couple of details on the technical side. There are three main contracts in use here. First is the Oracle contract, which keeps track of the current EVIX index level and calculates updates to the index via outputs from the Squeeze contract. Second is the AMM pool, which is a constant product market maker and keeps track of current assets in the pool and the current price. And last is the margin pool contract, handling all end user interactions with the protocol, where users deposit collateral, make trades, and manage any LP positions they have. And this contract also handles settling funding, keeping track of collateral levels and liquidating user positions. A couple of quick things on our future work.
00:36:40.986 - 00:37:21.238, Speaker D: It will include automating and decentralizing the index calculation and funding settlement process, incorporating other data feeds into the index such as univ three pools and other option markets, expanding to different underliers and collateral types, adding the ability to trade expiring contracts, and implementing a retail focused vault strategy similar to today's popular decentralized option vaults. With that, I want to say a big thank you to ETHGlobal, the judges and sponsors for putting on a great hackathon. The demo app is live on bropston at EVIX app Herokuapp.com with a mock USDC Faucet up on the site. And there's also a work in progress, White Paper up there as well. If anyone has any questions or wants to chat, volatility, my DMs are open on Twitter at underscore.
00:37:21.334 - 00:37:40.154, Speaker A: Thank you. Amazing. Thanks, Lee. Amazing demo. Perfect product in the current market that we need. So I hope that this goes to mainnet soon for all of us to benefit and glad to see this also on desknet. All right, next up we have Lewis from Okvault.
00:37:40.154 - 00:38:13.360, Speaker A: So Lewis, whenever you're ready, we'll just have you turn on the video and unmute yourself and we should be good to go on the live stream. Perfect. Got it. Thanks. Here we go. Hey hackmani. My name is Luis and I'm part of Organic Labs.
00:38:13.360 - 00:38:59.356, Speaker A: Today we're going to be presenting to you our latest product okvolt, the first Reverse biding auction generator. We currently live in a world where big individuals are able to win auctions by pushing more money and outbidding the regular individuals. But don't worry, we're here to change that. Regular actions have one thing in mind make money. And this benefits the whales. Individuals that can easily outbid anyone else by pushing more money into the ocean. To be clear, becoming a whale is not rocket science.
00:38:59.356 - 00:39:59.590, Speaker A: You'll now keep to be pushing money into your wallets. But let's take a moment and wonder a simple question what if what if we could imagine a new type of auction? A new type of auction that brings powers to the smaller individuals. An auction where everyone is invited, an auction owned by the community and most importantly an auction that can maximize the profits for the creators. We present to you the reverse bidding auction. It follows one simple premise the winner will be whoever bids the lowest unique amount between one cent and one hundred dollars. Everybody pays a small entry fee defined by the creator and earns a fair chance to win the auction. During this hackathon we created a mobile DAP to interact with our small countries.
00:39:59.590 - 00:41:08.704, Speaker A: We're now fully integrated with MetaMask and our sponsor Coinbase Wallet. We're also using the new EPNS service to deliver push notifications to all of our participants and we have completed the migration of our smart contracts to the popular CK Sync 20. Now let's take a look at Okvault in action. You can download or mobile app with one click by visiting this website. Once we have logged in, we'll be able to browse different live auctions and review the details. You can now place your bid by simply selecting between one cent and one hundred dollars that you want to place your bid you will only play the entry fee that was defined by the creator. Once the auction has been completed and everybody has placed their bids, the owner of the auction will be able to withdraw the funds and select the winner.
00:41:08.704 - 00:42:10.516, Speaker A: To find out the winner of this auction we'll go bid by bib and cancel every duplicated bid in the auction. For example, once we have completely burned all the repeated bids we're left with a list with a short list of unique numbers and it's very simple to find out the lower beast out of the shortlist. In the future months we'll allow you to add multiple standard talkers to your vault including ERC twenty s seven twenty ones and of course 1155s winners will receive a Pope for the auction and by the end of this year we'll complete our rollout in our CK rollouts, a new world is in the making. Don't let the world. Decide your future. Scan this code or visit this website to join our defined revolution. Get your Matic Mumbai ready and join our Alpha Action this afternoon to win up to 111 matic.
00:42:10.516 - 00:42:47.562, Speaker A: The entry fee is only ten cents of matic. We hope this idea inspires you to build on top and create new products along the way. We'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Whether you're an investor, a creator or a charity organization, reach out to us on Twitter, Discord or GitHub. Thank you for your time. Thanks so much Louis. That was a really good way to think about fairness and I'm glad that you were able to make that demo and can't wait to have this become a norm in how we do auctions from here on.
00:42:47.562 - 00:42:58.094, Speaker A: Congrats. Thanks cardik. Sorry but I didn't turn on my video, I just forgot. All good. Well, we can see you now and we also saw an amazing demo. So great. Well, thank you.
00:42:58.094 - 00:43:13.550, Speaker A: And with that, we are ready for our next demo and that is Team Hashspace. So, Ali and team, whenever you're ready. Thank you so much. Karthik, Chris, please go ahead and share your screen. Brilliant. Hi. We are Team Hashspace.
00:43:13.550 - 00:43:53.018, Speaker A: We have created a DeFi product discovery game. Our team has found each other during Hackmoney and ETH Amsterdam. Right now, it's very hard for users to discover and trial the many DeFi products available to them. We have created a space exploration adventure game. By combining GameFi DeFi and healthfi, we reward users for discovering and trying new DeFi products. Players travel the galaxy in a starship fueled by their footsteps. Each planet they visit is a different DeFi protocol and they can win yield from it to get a firsthand taste.
00:43:53.018 - 00:44:22.534, Speaker A: This is a completely new user acquisition opportunity for DeFi products. Players start by choosing a galaxy. We have deployed the game across three different chains polygon, Oasis and Arbitrum. The player registers and buys an NFT starship. The NFT sales populate the game's treasury. The treasury is deployed into planets. These planets are actually vaults which are powered by partner DeFi solutions.
00:44:22.534 - 00:44:50.100, Speaker A: They generate yield over time using their respective protocol. The ships are powered by players'footsteps synced from smart devices. When players arrive at a planet, they learn more about the protocol and the first player to arrive gets the yield as bounty. When a new protocol is ready to be featured in the game, we introduce them as a new planet. This creates an ever growing universe for players. Let's check out the demo now.
00:44:55.800 - 00:45:38.576, Speaker D: So here we are at Hashbase Quest and we have some information about the game. And this is where new users can come and register by clicking this button here. When a new user registers, that mints an NFT for them at the cost of zero, one of the respective token. And that NFT can be seen also on Openc. When a new player joins the game, a notification is sent to the EPNS channel as well as other mechanisms mechanics around the game so people can subscribe for updates if they want to. I'm going to join by connecting my wallet and once I'm in I can see the number of steps that I have already synced and the amount that I've earned in the game. If I wanted to sync more steps I can click here and this queries the Google Fit API and will update the number of steps I have in the top right, I can now click through and go to the game.
00:45:38.576 - 00:46:22.480, Speaker D: And here I can see the galaxy and this is the Polygon planetary system because we're on Mumbai at the moment and I can see a number of different planets and I can see the starships for other players inside this game. If I want to, I can click on other planets and get more information about the games, about the protocols that are behind the planets. So here I can see MakerDAO is the protocol generating yield for this planet. I can also then have a look at a few others. So here for example, we have uniswap generating the yield. Here the red spaceship is my starship and I'm currently on a yearn planet and this one up here is Ave and I can move to these different planets. So here I can see I need 1720 steps and I have enough so therefore I can initiate a movement over to this new planet.
00:46:22.480 - 00:47:20.448, Speaker D: And here I can see my starship moving and once I land it will initiate a transaction which does a few different things. The first thing that it does is update the location of my starship NFT on chain. Additionally it will also discount the number of steps that I have and depending on whether there is any yield available on this particular planet, it may or may not increment the amount that I've earned. So I'm just going to initiate that transaction now it and while the transaction is going through, we have this blue bar at the top to indicate that things are being processed. And once the transaction completes, we'll see the steps go down and we'll find out whether or not we earned any reward from the particular business particular planet. We can also keep up to date with game ongoings again via the EPNS channel. So here we have the hashbase Quest EPNS channel people can subscribe to.
00:47:20.448 - 00:47:39.530, Speaker D: And here we can see that I was lucky, I earned 0.05 from visiting this planet. It's gone up to 0.03. So I was very kind of happy to earn that yield. And additionally one of the kind of plans for expansion is to add new planets. And as you can see this universe is infinitely expandable. It's all different planets and we can continue to add more.
00:47:39.530 - 00:48:00.348, Speaker D: And these are the amazing chains, DeFi protocols and tools that we use during the heck. Our next steps are to port the game to mainnet to also add RV and Yearn as the initial yield planets. And we're going to be deploying on optimism on nosis next as well. This is the live link for our demo hashbase quest. You can check it out. And this is the source code on GitHub.
00:48:00.444 - 00:48:24.570, Speaker A: Thank you. Amazing. Chris, Ollie and the rest of the team, congrats on this really fun, amazing game. This is definitely one creative way to get more people involved and hope to see this live and everybody's hands. Amazing. All right, so next up we have Alex from Yield Index. Alex, whenever you're ready, feel free to get started.
00:48:25.740 - 00:48:59.860, Speaker D: Hey. Yes. So today I want to present you an index. A product where you can create an index of yield opportunities, while others can invest it in one click. So on this hackathon, we worked as a team of three people. Me, myself worked on a product, pyle worked on front end while Jaeger worked on the smart contracts. So, with no further ado, let's dive into a product and let's create some indexes.
00:48:59.860 - 00:49:53.832, Speaker D: So we currently integrated with herec 20 stablecoins ave deposits and used sorry wire vaults. So let's create like wire meta vault. So we will add all Wiren's stablecoins vaults and earn yields on them. So here we can select the weights of our vault. Let's say we trust in Daimo than other stablecoins and we'll allocate the funds accordingly. So on the final step, we can see the overview of our index. We can name it, let's name it meta layer, we can see the total FY.
00:49:53.832 - 00:50:45.532, Speaker D: And let's deploy our index on chain. We currently deploy it on Phantom. In the future we want to deploy on others Ethereum's L two s like Arbitrum or Optimism. So here's our index. We can see as a user what's in this index. We can see the index composition, we can see the API for this index and we can invest in it. So let's say we want to invest 0.1
00:50:45.532 - 00:50:53.100, Speaker D: USDT in this index. First of all, we need to approve token spending.
00:50:56.750 - 00:50:57.500, Speaker A: It.
00:51:12.140 - 00:52:30.080, Speaker D: Now we are ready to buy this index under the hood, the depositing USDT to USDT wire vault. Then we're swapping portion of USDT into Dai and deposited it to Dai wire vault and the same for USDC. And in exchange, the smart contract sending a user as token representing a share in index. So here we can see that we have a portion of this index. And now we can withdraw it when we earned enough. And as an index creator, I can also rebalance it. It's currently done manually, so I can change the index composition.
00:52:30.080 - 00:53:35.970, Speaker D: For example, I can rebalance from dai to USDC. Let me repress the page. Yes. In the future we want to add support for other Ethereum L two networks. Add more yield instruments to our product and move to crosschain. Add some crosschain support to allow people compose indexes for crosschain products. So if you want to get in touch.
00:53:35.970 - 00:53:47.640, Speaker D: You can find our contacts on our team webpage and thanks everyone from Ace Global for this event and we are happy to get in touch. Thanks.
00:53:48.890 - 00:54:10.906, Speaker A: Amazing. Thanks Alex. I guess this wouldn't be an act on demo if Murphy's Law doesn't kick in, but we kind of made it through at the end and only some minor issues. Did not see the rebalance. Everything else was great. Congrats on making this an awesome protocol that kind of makes an index out of other yields and looking forward to using that someday. All right, two more demos to go and then we can go into all the prizes.
00:54:10.906 - 00:54:15.150, Speaker A: So next up we have our second last team and that is Polypus.
00:54:15.890 - 00:54:57.254, Speaker F: Hey everyone. So I'm Joseph, we are team of five and today we are proud to present you Polypus, an innovative protocol allowing the use of NFTs as collateral for loan. Indeed, we believe that we are just at the beginning of NFTs and that we need to propose today's standards for NFT use tomorrow. In fact, today these NFTs are generally not used. It is impossible to integrate them easily into DeFi, to use leverage or simply to edge part of the investment risk. Some protocol try to solve this problem by using two approach protocol based on an ave fork that works perfectly fine with liquid token, but only comes to NFTs. You can borrow only up to often 30% of the LTV.
00:54:57.254 - 00:55:53.280, Speaker F: The second approach are based on an inefficient P to P system when you need to find someone ready to lend you for a certain amount, certain duration and with a certain interest. For this reason, we develop Polypus, a protocol that allows instant lending using NFTs, allowing you high rates of return for liquidity provider. The protocol use an on chain order book to allow for LTV that reflect the risk appetite of the market and make matching between borrowers efficient. The liquidity provider will, for a given collection, choose the LTV for any NFT and deposit liquidity. In this way, the market decides on the pricing of the NFT. The borrower can then borrow instantly up to a certain maximum amount depending on its collateral at repay at any time before the due date. This predefined date corresponds in this contract for this proof of concept to the date used by the vast majority of loans, which is actually two weeks.
00:55:53.280 - 00:56:32.540, Speaker F: How does it work? Well, it's quite simple for the user, in this case the liquidity provider. This is the liquidity provider side. Remember, our system is based on one side order book, so the liquidity provider will have to determine for a given collection how much he wants to deposit and the maximum amount that can be borrowed. For any NFT in this collection, those at the top of the order book will match first with the borrowers. Borrowed liquidity is no longer available during the time of borrowing. Unused liquidity is deposited on a lending platform to ensure minimum yield while waiting to be matched. We'll see this a little bit further, but this is the main innovation in our project.
00:56:32.540 - 00:57:13.430, Speaker F: For the borrower side, it's even simple. You choose for a collection one or multiple NFTs as collateral, you can instantly borrow a certain amount of east determined by the market. You've got an interest fixed and you have your long duration and at some point if someone forgot to repay is notable. The NFT ceased to go to a Dutch auction and through game theory we should be able to extract the fair value on the market. So we deploy on Polygon. Mumbai so testnet and Arbitrum Rinkabee. As I said, we implement also compound on Rinkabee and Avium on Mumbai to put to work a new liquidity.
00:57:13.430 - 00:57:42.158, Speaker F: So let's go to the demo time. So once that you have connected your wallet, you end up on the market. Those are the collection that you can use today to supply and borrow. You also have the auction, I will come back to it later. And the dashboard with all of your position, let's try to borrow. This is the simplest action. So you can use one of the NFT in your collection and the market has determined that with this liquidity available, you can borrow up to 100 east.
00:57:42.158 - 00:58:15.480, Speaker F: In this case, I will simply borrow 35. So here you go and you can see your position then on the dashboard with the condom, the interest and you can repay at any time for the supply side. So let's say we're going to supply with the same collection. The main advantage here is that for example, I can supply only 3.5 east and I'm ready to lend up to 80 east for one NFT of this collection. So this is the main innovation part.
00:58:26.210 - 00:58:26.766, Speaker A: Okay?
00:58:26.868 - 00:58:47.960, Speaker F: So like I said, this is the way for us to determine the LGB that can be lend and borrow on the market. Yeah, okay, I think it should work anyway. For example, let's try to repay one of the loan that we have made before. So you pay not only the interest and the loan itself.
00:58:53.130 - 00:58:53.890, Speaker D: Okay?
00:58:54.060 - 00:59:35.480, Speaker F: And as I said, the auction part is like the place when NFTs that can be paid back or seized and through time the price will decrease to zero. So at some point it will meet the fair market price and we can repay the liquidity provider with the fair market price of the NFT. So the next step today we plan to launch on Mainet of course to add some securities features, some safety nets and we're looking not only for people to join us on this adventure, but also NFC's collection that want to be implemented first on the platform. Thank you very much.
00:59:38.010 - 01:00:00.370, Speaker A: Joseph, thank you so much for that awesome demo and just relaying stuff I'm seeing in the comments. This is such a beautiful UI and really hope to see this on Mainnet. So congrats. All right, well, with that, we are ready for our 10th and the last demo for today. So without further ado, let's welcome Whip. Hello, everybody.
01:00:00.900 - 01:00:31.128, Speaker G: I'm not your handle from Team Butter, and this is WIP. So at Butter, we like to see ourselves as sitting in between Dows and their treasuries. And one of the things that we notice is that Dows have a lot of inherent risk. And what we thought we do with WIP is we try to expose that risk. And that meant that WIP felt we could focus on treasury risk metrics and strategy backtesting. I just want to give you a little bit of background. As we know, we're in one hell of a downturn at the moment.
01:00:31.128 - 01:01:08.384, Speaker G: And it sucks for us as investors and people who live in web3, but it really sucks for Dallas. Some of them have gone from having massive treasuries that could last them for decades to basically nothing. And they're having to put in these incredible emergency measures like stopping hiring or stopping some of the work they plan to do. And this is not a new phenomenon. This risk was baked in during the bull market where most treasuries, they do a token sell, they issue assets and then they hold those assets. They don't dump them. And so that means that most of their treasury is denominated in a single token, maybe two tokens.
01:01:08.384 - 01:01:17.604, Speaker G: And as I just said, that could mean this is the uni treasury. You go from $4.2 billion in November down to about $2 billion in February.
01:01:17.732 - 01:01:18.212, Speaker A: Tough.
01:01:18.276 - 01:01:37.896, Speaker G: Really tough. And there's a lot of volatility inherent in running a treasury. But also the treasuries are made up of crypto assets and turns out they're super, super correlated. So hard to actually offset some of that risk. If one thing goes down, most of it's going down. So it's really, really tough. Just by the way, that the only thing that's uncorrelated.
01:01:37.896 - 01:02:05.312, Speaker G: There is doge for anyone who wants to avoid risk, hold doge. But realistically, there's a ton of great products out there in the market. Some of them are very new, but they are there. And the only problem is you kind of need a lot of expertise to be able to use them, even find them. And now actually, because of solidity and the environment in which these products are deployed, you need a lot of technical expertise as well. Dows can't just walk into these products and leverage them. So what's our problem? We've got treasury risk.
01:02:05.312 - 01:02:36.096, Speaker G: It's going unidentified. We don't have enough expertise. We don't have enough focus. Solutions do exist, but we need special knowledge to evaluate and operate those solutions. Our solution at WIP is real time treasury risk analysis, access to risk mitigation strategies and the ability to back test those strategies before committing the product is what it looks like on the right. As I said, it has the kind of graph on the left, basically on the right, you will pick a strategy and then you back test it and it gives you the overlay on the left. Fairly simple stuff.
01:02:36.096 - 01:02:53.540, Speaker G: What I'm going to do is just switch over to the demo and give you a little walkthrough. So this is the bitdao treasury. You can see it started at nothing. This is the year view. Switch to the three month view. It's probably a bit more straightforward. So this is the value over the past three months.
01:02:53.540 - 01:03:21.936, Speaker G: We've got the total value here, the volatility here and then the return versus ETH. And then we have the actual allocations, the volatility of each of those assets and then the risk contribution. Some of those are negatives, there's some rounding errors in there and all we have over here is the products available. So you could imagine this basically being able to curate products and plug those treasuries straight into them. What I'll do actually is just quickly switch over to another treasury which is the Uniswap Treasury. And in this one, again, this is Uni. This is the whole year.
01:03:21.936 - 01:04:39.576, Speaker G: And I said before, Uni has obviously experienced a significant loss in value and we only have one asset, right? So the risk contribution is 100% so there's a fair amount we could do here. One of the things that we worked on before was this spread product which allowed you to spread using superfluid your tokens into balancer pools and rebalance over time. So imagine you could plug that in, you could click it and you could actually test that strategy right here. So what we're going to do is we've got our asset here, imagine this just says Uni and then here we're going to put in 20% and then when we hit review what we should see is what that would look like if we had actually done this three months ago. If we had actually run this strategy, what would the impact be? And you can see we basically are dampening the kind of volatility by about 20%. It's a fairly simple calculation this one, but you can imagine how much more interesting this could be if you were to look at debt based funding using the uma's range token for instance. So you're actually adding assets to the treasury without selling them and then actually repaying them later on or using other strategies using like the escape strategies you're actually hedging or you're diversifying into ETH itself.
01:04:39.576 - 01:05:05.248, Speaker G: And sometimes even one of the good metrics here is just return versus ETH. Lots of treasuries are probably underperforming so they have a fairly clear metric of what would have happened if they'd literally just held ETH. And obviously there's a ton more that we could do here in terms of surfacing some of the properties. So you could actually change how much you're diversifying, the time over which you're diversifying and so on and so forth. And so we'd hope to in the future add a lot more of those strategies and allow you to stack some.
01:05:05.254 - 01:05:06.530, Speaker A: Of these strategies up.
01:05:06.980 - 01:05:29.370, Speaker G: So last but not least, that was a demo. If you want to find us, we're at Whip Buttery Money. Just put in a treasury address to see the volatility in that treasury and you can find the actual repo on Slash Butterdow, Slash Whip though we are not a dao and these are the handles of the team. There's four of us and you can find us all on GitHub. Thank you very much.
01:05:30.460 - 01:05:51.408, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much. And thank you for being a really amazing last demo for today. This is such a cool utility to kind of manage treasury, especially at scale, and just being able to see literally what a 20% shock resetting would do is not a small thing. So I'm glad that thrilled to make this thing work for the hackathon and hope to see other Dows users too. Absolutely.
01:05:51.494 - 01:05:52.636, Speaker G: Cheers, Karthik.

But don't worry, we will all be sharing the names very soon on Discord and also over email so you don't have to worry too much about not being able to see if you want or not. Plus you can also rewind this video live stream and just check and pause again. But just before we kind of get there, I want to make a quick note about the delivery rules. So everything is tentative and not final, which means that we have all the information that we need we just have to review everybody projects before we actually send any of these prizes. So we're verifying everybody's code base to make sure that everything that was built, everything that we're going to give a prize for, was built for the hackathon. And only then we get to distribute the prizes for everybody.
01:18:10.924 - 01:19:06.328, Speaker A: That tentative date right now is June 1, so we should have all of these things distributed by next week. And also if you applied for a pool prize and you don't see yourself on the list here, you do have the ability to bring that up and dispute any kind of misinformation or miscategorization during your submission process, but you have to do it in the next 24 hours. We'll be sending another message on the discord clarifying that if you don't see yourself there, please ping us now. But after 24 hours from now, we will not make any changes to that list. So congratulations to all of these amazing teams and we will send all that information for how to collect redeem and what the totals are to all of you very soon over multiple channels. And while this is still in the build process, you can head over to showcase egobal.com. And in the next little while we'll be able to see all the projects listed.
01:19:06.328 - 01:19:35.796, Speaker A: And if you go on your own project page from there, you can see which prizes you've won on your own project. So you don't have to remember you can just go on your own project submission and see on the right sidebar prizes you have been awarded. So, congrats. And we are now at the very end of concluding hack money. So before we kind of wrap things up, I want to say a few thank yous. There's a lot of people that make all these events happen, especially behind the scenes. This is our biggest event ever.
01:19:35.796 - 01:20:30.488, Speaker A: This is 1200 hackers, but including everybody else, we have over 1500 people helping out to make sure this event was successful from 76 different countries around the world. And it's just still mind blowing that we're able to manage to scale and have all of you included and be part of this thing and to kind of keep things running smoothly. We got to thank everybody that made sure that this actually is the right experience that everybody experiences. So I want to first thank all of our judges and mentors for taking the time to review 200 plus projects in a very short amount of time and giving really valuable feedback to all of our teams. So congratulations to all of the team members and also thank you to all of our judges. Then we have some of our amazing volunteers that make sure that things run behind smoothly behind the scenes, whether it's a zoom call with 1000 people to making sure that anything that you have a question about is answered to anything that you're stuck on is addressed immediately. Thank all these volunteers that make this possible.
01:20:30.488 - 01:21:10.212, Speaker A: Then we had so many amazing speakers giving workshops, talks, interviews and helping out with the summit. So all of these amazing speakers were there, creating so much educational content for all of you to use and learn from. And I want to thank all of them here especially, and then also our 200 plus amazing partners. There are so many people here from so many different protocols, really making sure that we're able to drive this space forward, independent of what's happening in the markets, and being able to focus on getting the developers the right. Way of getting access and unblocked on any of the things that they're stuck on to make sure that they have a great experience. So they continue building. Without all of these partners, this would absolutely not be possible.
01:21:10.212 - 01:21:57.204, Speaker A: I want to thank all of them for kind of being with us for the last three weeks. And lastly, I want to give a quick shout out to the ETH Global team, which does so much countless hard work behind the scenes to make sure that you're able to have a really consistent and amazing experience. So quickly shouting out to Kevin, K, Kevin, Ivan, Cree, Witchy, Minnie and Moaz, Luke, Emily, Andrew and Jacob from our team, making sure that you all have an amazing experience and you consistently continue to have that from moving forward. So those were all the thank yous. And let's try to wrap things up. So the finalists, we call them the finalists because we really don't want these events to be designed as a competition. If you've been to any Global event before, you'll kind of know the spoiler here.
01:21:57.204 - 01:22:34.780, Speaker A: But when we say somebody's a finalist, we're effectively saying they came first because we really don't want to make this a competition. And this becomes a way for us to really highlight some of the projects that we're excited about and everybody else in the community is as well. So, as of right now, officially, the ten teams that presented on this live stream are our official winners coming in first together. And as part of that, we'll be giving 1500 USDC per member from each of those ten teams. So congratulations to all of these teams. In addition to all of your prizes that you may have won, global will be giving 1500 to each of these team members. So congrats for being our finalist.
01:22:34.780 - 01:23:33.348, Speaker A: And that's not it for all of you who are still here with us, we are also going to be giving an amazing Hack Money T shirt, which is now available for you to claim at on Swag Ethgobal.com. So if you submitted a project, I want to really emphasize submitted, not just participated, submitted a project.

And I want to thank all of you for taking the last few weeks, especially to all of you as hackers, over 1200 of you that spent all this amount of time and energy and really kind of taking the time to better your own skills. So congratulations and we'll be following up with all these details again over email. So just because you're not on this live stream does not mean you won't be able to get access to everything that we announced today.
