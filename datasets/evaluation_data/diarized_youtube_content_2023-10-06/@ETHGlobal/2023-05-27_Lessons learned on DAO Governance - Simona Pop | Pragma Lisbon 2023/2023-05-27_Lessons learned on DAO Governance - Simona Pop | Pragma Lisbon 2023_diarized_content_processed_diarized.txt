00:00:07.530 - 00:00:36.790, Speaker A: Next up, I want to invite Simona to talk about how we can learn and do better governance. As DAOs become more and more prevalent she's been part of something so, so many DAOs over the last few years that we've kind of come up with and we kind of know of. And the Goal are going to have an interesting chat about some of the lessons learned, some of the things that we think we can apply in the future, and some things that we know that didn't work and why. So, without further ado, let's welcome Simona on stage.
00:00:42.910 - 00:00:43.930, Speaker B: Hello. Hello.
00:00:44.080 - 00:00:44.778, Speaker A: Good Morning.
00:00:44.864 - 00:00:45.846, Speaker B: Good morning, Till.
00:00:45.878 - 00:00:46.762, Speaker A: Technically morning.
00:00:46.896 - 00:00:49.450, Speaker B: Yes. It's morning somewhere.
00:00:50.030 - 00:00:50.810, Speaker A: That's Fair.
00:00:50.880 - 00:00:51.498, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:51.664 - 00:01:24.040, Speaker A: Well, we've known each other for quite some time, but this is our first time officially talking on an estate setting where people can also listen to our conversation, at least willingly. Okay, so I'm excited to talk to you about a lot of things, but something interesting happened this morning. If you follow Simone on Twitter, you may already know. But for those of you who don't, I'd love for you to tell us what did you announce today and the decision that led you to announce this?
00:01:24.730 - 00:02:39.578, Speaker B: So again, it's something that I've kind of been mulling over for a while and finally made the decision to, I guess, formally announce it is stepping back as a steward and a member of the steward council in Gitcoin. It's kind of been a slow process of coming out of that dow, and it definitely wasn't a decision that I took lightly. And I described the reasons in that Tweet. But in a nutshell, the past few months have just been a real departure from the original ethos and kind of value set of the original founders. I've been somewhat in the gitcoin sphere since 2018, when they built their Bounties offering on the standard Bounties protocol that I co founded. And so we kind of were adjacent in some way throughout these past few years. And then I got a little bit more involved helping out with governance modeling and strategy.
00:02:39.578 - 00:02:53.700, Speaker B: In 2021 2022. But since last year, just slowly, slowly kind of getting less and less involved. And I think, yeah, the decision today is just a clear kind of marker of that process.
00:02:54.950 - 00:03:10.114, Speaker A: Hopefully it's a good thing for you. And I know you've been thinking about that for some time now. Could you also go over a little bit more about what you did at Gitcoin Dow and sort of what your role was and sort of what sort of changed over time that led you to this announcement?
00:03:10.242 - 00:04:40.198, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think one of the main things with Dows, as we know, we definitely want them to work, but we need to put in the work to make them work. So one of the things that I did with Gitcoin was really mapping out and working on the governance flows and the governance process to actually make it a smooth and effective and genuinely value add, I guess, dynamic. And so when I came in, I restructured and, I guess, redesigned a lot of the flows that were in place, or rather put in flows that weren't in place to ensure that the resource and the value did indeed flow where it needed to. And it was done in a transparent, coherent way, in a way that allowed the most participation, the most engagement, and the most, I guess, positive outcomes for deploying resources and value. So I did a lot of that in 2021, 2022. I also led up Shelling Point, which I know a lot of you have attended the Shelling Points throughout 2022, and this final one in Denver in 2023, in February, which was my last one as a curator and steward of that particular event.
00:04:40.198 - 00:04:56.666, Speaker B: So it was a lot of, I guess, multilayered contribution, and it was hopefully all in the service of public goods, but the trajectory kind of changed at some point, and we'll dig into that.
00:04:56.688 - 00:04:57.738, Speaker A: In a few minutes.
00:04:57.904 - 00:04:58.474, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:58.592 - 00:05:27.558, Speaker A: Well, part of the reason why I'm excited to have this chat with you is not because just your involvement with KitcoIn, but there's so many other dows and organizations you've been part of in kind of shaping what this? Ecosystem is now that I know all that stuff is in your head, but I don't think we've successfully gone that out in the past. So we're going to try that today. But what other dows were you part of? And sort of how did you get involved with them? And we'd love to kind of have you touch on a little bit of what you did for each of those other dows as well.
00:05:27.724 - 00:06:26.774, Speaker B: So, I guess primarily it's one of the byproducts of being in this ecosystem for the past five, six years is I was part of that, I guess, big dow boom that mainly happened in 2020 when we were all stuck indoors and going, hey, we should do a bunch of dows. And it became easier and easier to launch a lot of dows. So I think in 2020, at some point, I was part of, I don't know, 15 or something. It was wild because it was just happening. And you want, hopefully, to try things out and to participate and to try to see what your participation can bring to a new structure, to a new way of doing things. So that was kind of the boom of the 2020, maybe early 2021, but a lot of enthusiasm happens at the beginning, and then, as we know, enthusiasm kind of peters out and then you're like, what should we do now?
00:06:26.892 - 00:06:31.714, Speaker A: Sony, you're part of, I guess, optimism and element, but what are some of the other ones?
00:06:31.852 - 00:07:17.400, Speaker B: Oh, no. So that was like the time of 2020 2021 when there was a lot of starters but not a lot of continuing the process of genuinely setting up Dows that actually function. And so what we're seeing now and these are the Dows that I'm also part of ENS optimism element are those dows where we are trying to figure out what these flows and these structures are that evolve us from that yay, let's start to let's continue and improve and evolve. So what I'm doing in these others dows is lending my perspective and my energy and my efforts towards that evolution of let's actually build things that work.
00:07:18.650 - 00:07:47.246, Speaker A: I mean 15 at any point was a lot I mean having one extra thing outside of your full time job is usually something that takes up most people's time doing that it must have been quite interesting. Why are you excited about dows? What do they mean to you and what made you actually say yes? Even though I feel like at that time you didn't know what you were getting into but what excites you about dows?
00:07:47.438 - 00:09:37.014, Speaker B: Look, I think the promise of dows Is still there. The problem is what we have right now and certainly what's happening in my soul is a balance between the excitement and the sheer weight of the dread of watching them not work. And so my excitement for this space and for these structures, particularly in the past few days, where we've seen so many ridiculous announcements and backtracks and real foibles in what we're trying to do and what is actually occurring is they truly have that promise of diversifying what value means. We're so used to in this world the way it is to just equate everything to money, cash money and everything is about extraction and we've been bastardized into this way of thinking for the past god knows how many generations. The idea with Dows is that and the reason why I'm saying diversifying value is because it starts becoming also about the value that is community, the value that is your individual contribution thank you. That definitely deserves the value that is your individual contribution and how it interacts with the other individual contributions at a local, regional world level, but also across different verticals. That isn't dictated by will it make money? Will it make profit? It becomes something where value is multifaceted because it really is and it allows us to kind of get back to that.
00:09:37.014 - 00:10:38.540, Speaker B: Now as I always say and as we're seeing it's damn hard building a new boat when you're firmly in the current boat and have to play by the current boat's rules so we're over here trying to hammer and nail in this and voila while the boat we're on is doing all of this. I mean it's an experience so it's also very exhausting which is why I'm saying the excitement comes with some seasickness attached but that is what is exciting about them that is what the promise is and that is why it's important to not let them repeat the same crap that we've already done just in a different environment. It's like I want to build a new house, but I'm going to literally build the same house just next door. I mean, why do that? Why do we limit ourselves? Kartik I don't know.
00:10:39.150 - 00:11:06.046, Speaker A: We'll talk about that. I do have a question on this, but I agree. I mean, I think when most people think DAOs, they think some DeFi protocol has come with the Dow and they're going to use that to incentivize growth of their protocol. Nothing wrong with that. But it's just more than just financial nature. Out of curiosity, what kind of interesting things you've seen Dows do that has nothing to do with money or purely finance related?
00:11:06.158 - 00:11:34.858, Speaker B: But there's so many things, right? Like if we look at the recent Optimism retroactive Funding, retroactive Grants Kernel, which is a program started by one of the old co founders of Gitcoin, in fact, which is an educational container that exists to initiate people into this ecosystem. And I think it got a lot.
00:11:34.864 - 00:11:38.122, Speaker A: Of doing courses and educational yes.
00:11:38.176 - 00:12:24.890, Speaker B: And also putting people together. And a lot of projects came out of that where co founders met and then they started building and then they got introduced to VCs. It's a really valuable and dare I say, public good for onboarding into this ecosystem. And it got a really good allocation of funds in the Optimism Round and I was really happy to see that because it is something that we don't want to lose. East Global is a result of this type of a lot of grants, right? A lot of grants. So it's incredibly important to what they can mobilize scholarships to attend events. I've headed up the scholarship program for East Denver.
00:12:27.470 - 00:12:35.966, Speaker A: We get students from all over the world coming in because they can't afford travel and because these other Dows give them scholarships to have them build cool things.
00:12:36.068 - 00:13:01.126, Speaker B: Exactly. Very important. A recent one in the NS Mall Grants Round was East Brazil were building a digital membership card to essentially solve for the problem that at their last hackathon some people snuck in and stole 30 laptops and they got funding to build. That wonderful. Yes, that those types of phase and.
00:13:01.148 - 00:13:58.786, Speaker A: They'Re important phase solving communities problems and it could be different things that people care about in different parts of the world and you now have a mechanism to help them effectively coordinate, correct an outcome. Very abstract, but we'll dig deep into it. Coming back to your house analogy, that's an interesting one. I do agree it's a little bit true, which is we kind of see that something kind of says that we're going to launch a Dow. Usually they follow the recipe of the last successful Dow that they can think of, which has done the same thing for kind of one before. And the recipe is something like we're going to launch a Dow, let's kind of set up a page to set up a delegate process. And then Simono's name is usually on the top of that list because you see a lot of people who want to kind of be part of the delegate programs and then they kind of define these are our values.
00:13:58.786 - 00:14:10.058, Speaker A: These are our mission statements. And we want to kind of get to all these goals, and people sort of delegate their tokens to some of those people. And that's kind of the part is.
00:14:10.064 - 00:14:11.310, Speaker B: That where you lose track?
00:14:11.460 - 00:14:22.190, Speaker A: Well, that's usually what gets more traction and then unless you're directly following, I feel like you have no idea what's going on. Is that a fair statement?
00:14:22.930 - 00:15:47.690, Speaker B: It is a fair statement and I think, as I said, we're definitely improving because I want to make sure that this is a commitment to myself to not just highlight the problems, but also look at where the improvements are being made and recognizing those and celebrating those improvements. I think the dedication to once this top layer of soil is there to actually look at what processes need to follow this starter kit. Right, that again, to your point, everybody uses, everybody sets up a notion, sets up a discord, does the delegate thing, does all of this la la, Twitter announcement, thousand likes, retweets, whatever. The idea is that and the work is in creating and mapping out the flow of decision making and resource. And as I say, resource isn't necessarily just cash money, but mapping those out before we rush to go from the starter kit to just getting some tooling and then that's it, we're done. So everybody right now is or not everybody, there is the pattern that we are breaking that goes starter and then we just put a bunch of tooling and that's it, we're done.
00:15:47.840 - 00:15:50.730, Speaker A: So maybe for my own benefit too.
00:15:50.800 - 00:15:51.420, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:52.270 - 00:15:57.630, Speaker A: What does it mean when you say people just go to tooling? Like what are they doing, what's wrong or what's not right about it?
00:15:57.780 - 00:17:53.906, Speaker B: Of course, when I say tooling is usually there's going to be a voting situation, there's going to be a snapshot and a tally put in, there's going to be some sort of payment mechanism. There's going to be an app that then enables the payment of contributors, that then enables the payment of work streams and so on and so forth. But the point is, before you get to that, you must know where and at what stage they come in and also who is involved in the decision making process that leads up to a payment that leads up to a vote that actually ensures that the information contained in a proposal is digestible to a level where people do not just rubber stamp votes, that they actually process the information in a way that isn't going to take ten. Years to do and also be able to make an informed decision and also be able to create an opinion for themselves that is based on context that is based on facts and what is presented to them. And also be able to compare, okay, is this funding, is this whatever the proposal is, does it make sense and is it in line with what this Dow is working towards? Is it in line with the principles of this particular Tao? Is it in line with my personal beliefs of what this Tao should be? Because that is true decision making right now, what tends to happen is we fall from the transparency and the clarity because at the end of the day, transparency is just clarity. It's having a clear picture of something, a clear view. Don't stop me because I'm on the roll, god damn it.
00:17:53.906 - 00:18:25.120, Speaker B: So a clear picture of what that flow is and what tends to happen when you lose the clarity is you have shadow. What happens in the shadow, dodgy shit. We're all unsure, or at least a portion of us I hope, working on our shadow selves. Maybe the whole point is avoid that before it comes so solidified or we fall back into the shadow where crap happens that shouldn't be happening.
00:18:25.810 - 00:18:26.926, Speaker A: I didn't say anything.
00:18:27.028 - 00:18:32.078, Speaker B: I mean you didn't because I was saying everything and it was really good anyway. I caught it back.
00:18:32.164 - 00:19:09.050, Speaker A: I agree. I think, as you were just saying, this thing, one thing just clicked to me was seems like a common thing that people are conflating is that they think transparency is on what the final decision is but not the actual decision making process because everything we do is on chain. I can see who voted for what and who didn't or what their motivations were. All the arguments or productive conversations on these forums. It's still public but not always around what led to that decision. And is that kind of what you meant to sort of say that this is the biggest piece that the tooling doesn't sort of solve?
00:19:13.250 - 00:20:20.786, Speaker B: I'm going to quote, unquote, drop some truth, but everybody knows this is that a lot of the decisions made in Dows are literally done within minutes of vote closing. People usually look at what other people they know voted on. People usually look at like, does this look like more of a yes, more of a no? It's always like, this is the other thing. It's always binary yes or no. Where's the nuance? Where is the oh maybe but like this or maybe but like that? And so what I'm trying to say is a clear process and by process I mean almost like a certain standard of what ingredients go into the decision making flow that would stop us or rather curtail this tendency of not digesting anything and just mechanically voting on things at the last minute. And chances are you probably don't even know what you voted on.
00:20:20.888 - 00:20:26.102, Speaker A: Also, at least situations where certain people end up influencing correct that is also.
00:20:26.156 - 00:21:14.660, Speaker B: An issue because what we're seeing, and certainly in a lot of Dows, what you're seeing is literally the top delegators can sway a vote and we've seen this happening. I won't name names and all of that because but we've seen this in the history of Dows where votes were put up for two days over a weekend, nobody paid attention and a vote passed because the major delegators voted on it and it technically matches the process. Right? Technically it hit quorum but how many of those people would or how many people in that community would have wanted an opinion the ability to vote but again nobody knew the vote was happening or they didn't pay attention that the vote was happening and it just happened.
00:21:15.290 - 00:21:58.290, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the interesting thing is that people even myself included you can sort of see what this looks like because it's not really a company. It's a new way of thinking about organizing and coordination especially with just anybody can be part of it and at scale. But as we are part of this century or wherever we live we know that there's a clear hierarchy that companies have. There's somebody usually in charge that influences the decisions and this is like an entirely inverted model and it's natural for you to think about oh I'm just going to trust the person at the top to do this. But that doesn't always lead to the right outcomes.
00:21:58.630 - 00:21:59.374, Speaker B: It doesn't.
00:21:59.422 - 00:22:01.780, Speaker A: And I think we're seeing symptoms of that too.
00:22:02.230 - 00:23:07.606, Speaker B: We do and I think really the differentiation comes from and it's slight but I feel it's very powerful. We don't work for DAOs. We don't work for other people. We work with other people in a Dao. And that small yet incredibly important distinction allows for responsibility and accountability of your own actions and your own contributions and the value that you bring to actually be a moving piece of that puzzle. When we work for as we do in traditional corporations and again for generations we've been used to this kind of stupid dynamic you can hide in the system and also for people who know how to play the system because they've been doing it for God knows how long. Again you end up in these dodgy power imbalances that just get us right back where we started.
00:23:07.606 - 00:24:06.710, Speaker B: The idea is working towards working with, working together. That is the type of pattern and the type of mindset that we need to have when we approach these new systems. And dare I say still there's a lot of Dows that are just corporations and the same goddamn model that have a facade of a Dow. It's almost like, you know those dodgy kind of stands and there's like the thing peeling off and it's like Dowed but it's like ink underneath. It kind of feels like that and that essentially drives a lot of these folk pods. A lot of these things that are happening and we've seen so many even this week or in the past two weeks happen time and time again and until we number one change the intention. And number two, change that process, we're going to still fall into the same pattern.
00:24:06.710 - 00:24:19.102, Speaker B: Same old, same old, same old, same old again. Optimistically, I think we can do that. We can do it. Come on.
00:24:19.156 - 00:24:35.074, Speaker A: Yeah. This is a thing that requires time and self reflection, which is what we're doing here on stage. We're talking about this and recommending what things we know don't work. It doesn't mean we know what the right answers are, but we know what the wrong answers were for sure.
00:24:35.112 - 00:24:40.902, Speaker B: I think even us having this conversation is genuinely a step towards that. So hopefully yeah.
00:24:40.956 - 00:25:14.740, Speaker A: And for the next 15 Dowels you join, you get to recommend some better practices that help you stay on the mission and make sure that you get to, I guess, manage when you are off track. And in the value generation or creation piece, we talked about a lot of problems or rather learnings if somebody were to think about starting fresh, what's a good recipe for a successfully managed Dow in 2023?
00:25:15.350 - 00:26:45.390, Speaker B: So again, coming back to and a lot of you or some may know this, but one of the things that I've been looking at lately, again, in this kind of attempt to get back to a certain sense of flow and a certain sense of logic when it comes to the processes that need to exist in a dao. Because a dow is a complex flow network, right? There's funding, there's decision making, there's resource, all of that. Where you also find this is in nature. And one of the talks that I've and what I've been exploring is a lot of biomimicry stuff, right? Like how are complex flow networks in nature mapped out and how do they exist and how do they survive and how they have been surviving for a few billion years. Which kind of is a good track record, particularly when you talk R and D. And one of the things that comes up time and time again in the way these ecosystems exist naturally is this clarity of flow and the different nodes that flow touches and the fact that some nodes have weaker connections with each other and others have stronger connections with each other. I think right now we're in this place and I will get back to the practical thing, just tiny parenthesis.
00:26:45.390 - 00:27:57.522, Speaker B: What we tend to do is it's either too many things and we make decisions on everything or there's too few. There's none of that bit in the middle which is where the juicy, good functioning stuff is. And so what I am suggesting and what I propose, and some people don't necessarily like this, but I believe that a level of standardization in the baseline of that flow is necessary. The reason I say this, all of us here are very different. What do we have in common? Our vein system, if it doesn't irrigate the certain organs with blood, the organism doesn't function. And what we're trying to do normally is add a whole bunch of stuff like a hat and a backpack and whatever, but not pay attention to the flow of the stuff that keeps the thing alive. And so this level of standardization is very clear proposal format because what we're seeing right now is I have a proposal that's an emoji and one that has 100 pages there's.
00:27:57.522 - 00:29:10.794, Speaker B: So such excess of differentiation between these things that make the effort of digesting, the effort of understanding what a proposal is, what the decision is incredibly laborious, which is why most people don't do it. So what I'm proposing is this patterning where there is a very clear format for a proposal that does contain certain key ingredients that you just present. Don't hide it in page 25. Maybe have it in a TLDR at the beginning so I know what I'm about to digest. Criteria for the proposals being put forward. What are the values of the dow, what is the purpose of the dow that I'm proposing my thing to? Is it even in light? If I'm going to propose some educational thing to a dow that wants to, I don't know, organize Porsche trips, maybe that's not the best fit, but there should be that criteria that immediately curates the proposals that come in because of alignment. I'm not saying gatekeep.
00:29:10.794 - 00:29:17.630, Speaker B: I'm not saying anything like that. I'm seeing curation in the process of helping.
00:29:18.050 - 00:29:28.258, Speaker A: If anything, you're telling the dow that this is what we don't value, so let's eliminate those cases. But you can have flexibility in, hey, maybe this is creative and we'll learn new thing.
00:29:28.344 - 00:30:16.446, Speaker B: Absolutely. So again, none of this is meant to act as a gatekeeping mechanism or anything like that. It is genuinely what is the most natural flow for something to go through that is relevant for this particular dow? Then the decision making process. Who decides and on what do we decide? Do we decide on every single thing that we're going to do? We're going to switch from, I don't know, discourse to something else? Do we need a vote on that? That's too much diversity of decision making. What we want is the sweet spot in the middle because then you don't have fatigue from voting on 10,000 meaningless things. You can focus more energy and attention on the things that do matter. The other thing is some sort of cadence.
00:30:16.446 - 00:30:40.098, Speaker B: We are creatures of habit. Humans like habits. When you do not and again, what I'm trying to introduce here is our habits that help you focus more energy and attention to the things that generally need it. Imagine waking up every morning and having to tie your shoelaces. It would be incredibly laborious and very annoying.
00:30:40.194 - 00:30:41.842, Speaker A: You mean like learning to tie learning.
00:30:41.916 - 00:30:52.320, Speaker B: To tie your shoelaces? It's like, why do we need to do that? Every single time we get into a new dow? Go like, okay, well, how do they map this? How does this work. What is this.
00:30:54.930 - 00:31:29.354, Speaker A: Is interesting because I just realized that this is basically how college applications work. Like everybody had a different process and then all these things came in and they created this common form that just standardized all the things that everybody should care about. And once you fill that form, you are ready to send it to any college. But not everybody has to look at all the answers or the same ones, but they just kind of combine everything to understand. And it is a standard in a way you're proposing that at least helps us figure out what to kind of quickly sip through. It may not be everything that everybody cares about.
00:31:29.552 - 00:31:45.582, Speaker B: And honestly, I feel that will enable the interoperability of talent far more and of personal resource and personal value. If you can just go cross dow without this huge learning curve that you.
00:31:45.636 - 00:31:47.294, Speaker A: Get to filter for what you care about.
00:31:47.332 - 00:32:14.790, Speaker B: Exactly. And I think that is and again, it takes work because we don't know how to do that because we're in this other boat where we do things really weird and whatever, but if we can stick to that and keep working at that, I think it will get us into a better place. And like I say, we've seen the evolution from the boom of the Dows in 2020 to where we are now, right where there is concerted effort in figuring out how these things work.
00:32:14.860 - 00:32:17.862, Speaker A: And I see improvements. Like it's not just we're repeating everything.
00:32:17.996 - 00:32:34.578, Speaker B: Correct and it's like one step forward, two steps back. Okay? It's how learning happens. And it's not going to be overnight because none of this is going to be overnight. But that I feel is a helpful step towards a successful Dow in 2023. 2024. Blah.
00:32:34.694 - 00:32:36.330, Speaker A: So dows are not doomed?
00:32:36.490 - 00:32:42.960, Speaker B: No. Even though you might think that, but they're not. I don't think they are.
00:32:45.110 - 00:33:01.990, Speaker A: Any closing thoughts on how we can make this better for people who are thinking about not just starting DAOs but also joining them? Because it is effectively each of us that care about different causes and we want to be part of a community that also shares those same values.
00:33:03.450 - 00:34:20.670, Speaker B: Value here is, I would say, the big one. And value alignment and making sure that whatever you start you join is genuinely aligned with your values. And if you see things that aren't in line with those values and if you see things falling into the old patterns, I would genuinely urge you to find the other people who also feel like you and figure out how you can improve versus, I guess keeping with the status quo. And just it's one of the main reasons why I'm stepping away from Gitcoin because I tried. I genuinely tried. But at the same time, I'm like my energy is better spent elsewhere and I think by helping other dows or by sharing the experiences that I've had, hopefully it does make. People feel a lot more empowered and a lot more responsible and a lot more accountable for like hell, actually no, I don't agree with this or I think this could be better or this could possibly help us get from point A to 8.1.
00:34:20.670 - 00:34:58.970, Speaker B: Whatever it is, it's small incremental steps. But I think that the intention of genuinely wanting to change this stuff, not because you want money and clout and all of this garbage, that legitimately. I mean the world as it is. I mean, okay, it's cool and it's fun and we go to parties but honestly, we need to elevate what the things that we're thinking about. If the number of Twitter followers and all of this crap or if you're first in the governance table or God knows what else is like your motivation for being in Dows. It's not good enough. It's not a pure intention.
00:35:00.510 - 00:35:29.640, Speaker A: It's cliche for me to say this, but unlike large organizations, you actually have the ability to make that change and still affect a same equal size group of peers or constituents. And that's just not a thing that we are commonly aware of in anywhere else except web3. And if you are not happy about something, you do get to actually drive for a change. You may not be 100% successful, but oftentimes change happens.
00:35:30.010 - 00:36:15.220, Speaker B: It does happen. And I think coming back to that boat analogy because we're like by the sea so it makes sense. It's very hard to genuinely switch from an extractive mindset. And again, I say we've been bastardized into this way of thinking for a very, very long time. Our first instinct is to extract and this is fertile new ground for all of that behavior. But the key is unlearning all of that stuff, unlearning the patterns that you would have followed in a corporation. Because again, you don't work for, you work with.
00:36:15.220 - 00:36:19.266, Speaker B: You are not subservient.
00:36:19.378 - 00:36:20.534, Speaker A: You represent yourself.
00:36:20.652 - 00:37:09.078, Speaker B: You represent yourself and the things that you bring are the things that you bring and you have value and you bring value and together with the other people in these new constructs, have a genuine shot at making this stuff work. But it does take commitment and it is soul destroying sometimes and it is exhausting because we are unlearning behaviors the same way. As I'm saying let's set up new patterns, let's set up new behaviors. Unlearning something is fucking hard. And another thing that we all need to get very comfortable with is change. Any notion of change involves loss. This is why people hate it.
00:37:09.078 - 00:37:33.286, Speaker B: This is why people hate change. It's not that they hate the new thing, it's that they hate losing the old thing. Like even if it's decrepit and gross and you need to throw like some slippers, you need to throw them out because they're like cesspool of bacteria. But you're like but they're so comforting and I've had them for a while. That's what people fear. It's not change. It's the sense of loss.
00:37:33.286 - 00:37:43.310, Speaker B: And depending on who you are and what your relationship with loss is, and this is where we are all individuals because we have different relationships with loss, it's going to be harder or easier.
00:37:45.090 - 00:38:03.318, Speaker A: And that's a truth that's Sage Meta observations about how divoting works. And I think a nice point for us to close this off today. So thank you so much for this amazing chat, and hopefully we get to make Dows better this year.
00:38:03.404 - 00:38:03.860, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone.
