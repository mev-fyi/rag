00:00:07.370 - 00:00:25.010, Speaker A: Hi everyone. So my name is Sergi Ponz. I'm co founder of oneish Network. It's a pleasure to stay here. Thanks for coming. It's good to see people who would like to win up to $20,000 this second. So we have really nice bunches.
00:00:25.010 - 00:00:58.942, Speaker A: But first of all I would like to introduce who we are, why we are here and why you should build on top of One Inch network to the end tomorrow. So who we are. I am also a hacker back 2018. I started with my cofather Anton bookov to travel around the globe. First hackathon was December 2018. I met Vitalik, butarian I met a lot of other people and for now it's cool. It's really cool.
00:00:58.942 - 00:01:39.542, Speaker A: I had already like 1516 years of software engineering experience but never participated on hackathon. And for now we can build with London over just tonight, something which can win a prize and we can pay for our airplane tickets for hotels. Actually we almost never needed a hotel because we were staying always on a venue. Also, when we built One Inch first protocol back in 2019 in May, we didn't sleep. I didn't sleep 56 hours. So it was quite hard. But you see, nowadays we have a huge set of protocols.
00:01:39.542 - 00:02:12.658, Speaker A: We started with the aggregation protocol, then we have built liquidity protocol. We came to our dow. Our token was launched by the foundation back in 2020. We have built our self custody wallets because we didn't find a proper wallet out there. The minimas was really terrible and from a point of view still there are issues with other wallets. That's why we just have different teams working on the space to just not compete but improve and add value to the space. We have our own limitora protocol.
00:02:12.658 - 00:02:58.802, Speaker A: It's fully decentralized one based on signature, similar to Zero X and other approaches, but highly efficient. We introduced our fusion December last year we did hackathon over one month with our people in Dubai. They got breakfast, lunch and dinner, spa, gym, pool, family could come. So we just tried to create such an environment which you meet here at TGH Global Hackathon and it worked. We were able to deliver in just one month the fusion and we were really happy about that. Nowadays we are also working on institutional products. We try to enter the space of traditional finances and improve the settlements.
00:02:58.802 - 00:04:08.326, Speaker A: For example, with our swaps with our aggregation we are like three years old. I would say the project is almost four years old. The first year we just were working with Anton in the nights I was working for Porsche and he for near protocol and one day we raised money. So in total we raised like 190,000,000 of US dollars and continue to develop new products to ship new innovations. We keep 70 percentage of the aggregation market share. This market we created actually on the hackathon we came to the idea how to make a swap more efficient by aggregating among decentralized exchanges and choose based on specific algorithm only those pools which make sense to use as liquidity source. So at the end the user get the best rate a limit aura's market share is about 80 percentage this huge we achieved like in just one year from zero to 80 percentage of the market share and overtook zero x and other protocols we have four and a half million wallets who are using one each protocols.
00:04:08.326 - 00:05:00.960, Speaker A: It's not huge, but at the end like you can see in the left corner, they generate 330 billions of US dollars since 2019 and we have one at 80 core contributors around the globe like freelancers who are full time working on one inch network protocols. So we see Dex volume continues to grow and it looks like we can overtake centralized exchanges because decentralized exchanges are more efficient than centralized. So you don't have to trust anyone. You just interact with the smart contract. You have no intermediaries. Except validators, of course. And this is room to grow for us all here with developing Web Three space.
00:05:00.960 - 00:05:25.966, Speaker A: But we have current limitation DeFi space. We have unfairable swap rates. We have meth attacks. I faced my really painful mev attack last year when Ethereum dropped to 1000 because of tax reasons. I had to sell my Ethereum to buy again. So to just declare loss in my tax report and I was front run. I lost ten ethereum.
00:05:25.966 - 00:06:01.578, Speaker A: It was really painful for me. So I could use this money for my daughter or I can for charity or whatever but some attackers got it and I went to our teams and I said like guys, doesn't work, we need solution for this. And then we came to the idea with the fusion I will explain a little bit later and of course we have problem in web three space that the user experience is very complicated. Still very complicated from our side. We try to improve with the wallet. We have really nice UX UI. Now we have these kind of meta transactions with Fusion.
00:06:01.578 - 00:07:01.650, Speaker A: It improves, but still there's a lot of things to build to the problems, front running attacks. So someone see your transaction into something before you extract value from this. The math attacks are like if someone don't know how that works in terms like math, someone is monitoring the mempool and analyze make it sense to exchange before you to exchange after you to extract value from your trade. If you for example exchanging directly on uniswap. So someone is doing this. They make a lot of money back in 2022, they just earned one and a half billions of Westos just by out of senior. How? Because government says nowadays so I just saw like around ten percentages of the transactions.
00:07:01.650 - 00:07:51.858, Speaker A: Now you have two ways you have the cerny path with using DEXes directly you don't get the best rates, you don't know really where the liquidity is concentrated and you don't know where the token is listed. And you face also the math attacks, you face the front running attacks. So this is not really efficient. That's why we from our side we call it turnipass like Black Forest. You don't know which animal can attack you in the next time. And we try to build the other side, where we come to our fusion. But before, I would like to explain once again about the aggregation itself.
00:07:51.858 - 00:08:27.390, Speaker A: Maybe it's not clear for everyone. I know some people of you are very advanced, but some people still just know that I can go to uniswap and just exchange there. There's more. We came to the idea with London to aggregate among distro exchanges and multiple liquidity sources. Right now we have on Ethereum more than 25,000 liquidity sources. Each smart contract with liquidities on liquidity source. So at the beginning we just exchange on one market, just for example Ethereum to die.
00:08:27.390 - 00:09:08.886, Speaker A: But it makes no sense to just use one market. Plus, if you exchange hundreds of thousands of US dollars, maybe 10,000 of US dollars, it makes sense to use also other markets like USDT market UCC market Ethereum to something else. In this case you see Ethereum to Cusdt. This is a compound USDT. Actually our algorithm buffigner can also build a path to just put Ethereum into USDT landing pool of compound, for example. So in this case we use market makers who also integrated in our aggregation protocol and routing. We have uniswap, we have social swap.
00:09:08.886 - 00:10:03.018, Speaker A: You see part V exchange to Dai part V exchange through USDC. From UDC we go to USDT and from Dai we go also to USDT. And then at the end the user get the best experience and best execution rate. Because we actually did an arbitrage just actually an arbitrage algorithm which we are using. So, fusion, this is new approach how to exchange assets. Nowadays it works very well on ethereum. Since when you do the transaction by yourself if you do this transaction by yourself and the amount is higher than around $10,000, someone will front run you, someone will sandwich you and you will lose good amount of money in normal cases like 50 bips what you lose.
00:10:03.018 - 00:10:45.014, Speaker A: And this is not how it should be. And fusion solves this problem. Fusion is based on our limitora protocol. You just give a signature that you're okay to exchange one asset against another asset in a specific amount. And you would like to exchange for specific rates, not just for one specific rate. Like if you do a normal limitora. This is a specific grid we call it, which use the current market liquidity because our algorithm knows exactly how many tokens are where and which rates you get for which amounts, for which peers.
00:10:45.014 - 00:12:21.080, Speaker A: This way we can build such a nice grid and you see the price going down from the current Oracle price and goes down to the current market rate if you do market swap. So when you do market swap, you face a price impact so you get less than you have originally because liquidity is not really huge and every decks need to earn something uniswap earns like different pools. 30 beeps, one beep, five beep, one beeps so of course our algorithm can optimize this but yeah, still it's kind of difficult here to achieve the best execution. So we were thinking why should we do a Dutch auction in linear? We could just use discrete which comes directly from the liquidity amount from the current network. So in this case, someone exchanged real case 3700 Ethereum to USDT and they got $2,345 more compared to if they would just execute it by themselves, theoretically she would face the MAF attack would get actually less. And also if they wouldn't face the MEF attack because they would use maybe RPC of flashboards or our rabbit hole RPC Endpoint which protects people as well from front running attacks. Anyway, this execution was better because we see these partial fields you see here, small partial fields, these are greens green points.
00:12:21.080 - 00:13:32.510, Speaker A: Arbitrage traders, when they see such arbitrage opportunity, they go and hedge on positional centralized exchanges. They are exchange also with own liquidity and also they hedge with other networks as well. For example, if you're buying polygon like matic token, they potentially they will exchange it like hedge the position market trade in the reverse direction and another network where they see more liquidity and come back to Ethereum to arbitrage back. And actually we allow over time to sell specific amount of tokens by giving a chance to arbitrage trader to arbitrage this trade. That's why it's better than just doing a market market trade. Actually market makers are selling tokens over weeks, months and theoretically you can also set up with a custom mode you can set an order to sell it in maybe two days because you have a shit token. It's not super liquid, but there's some liquidity on centralized exchanges and then if you set such order arbitrage trader try to arbitrage among distributed exchanges and different networks and also centralized exchanges.
00:13:32.510 - 00:14:28.798, Speaker A: How it works under the hood, it's very important to understand it is kind of auto book. Some people are switching like swapping in one direction, the other in the other direction ethereum to UCC, UCC to Ethereum then our solvers who are able to settle the trades can match these orders. That's why it's also sometimes very efficient to use also fusion because there are also other people who would like to exchange the tokens maybe in the reverse direction, the resolvers these are professional market makers. We have a special game theory for tokenomics. We changed it recently, also in December. Together with fusion release, you need to stake one ish tokens to get unicorn power. This unicorn power decrease in time based on the burning curve.
00:14:28.798 - 00:15:43.370, Speaker A: That means you have to maintain all the time to have almost one token to one unicorn power and with this unicorn power you can become resolver or you can ask someone to delegate the unicorn power to you to became top ten resolver. Only top ten resolver can execute the settlement. So the settlement is done through smart contracts fully in decentralized manner fully permissionless in terms of everyone can send the order but in permission manner only specific resolvers who were selected by the community or had enough unicorn power they can settle the trades and have these chance to arbitrage among centralized exchanges. Already said decentralized exchanges also with only quidity. There are market makers like Witter Mute trading with only liquidity and providing better rates than you can get on Uniso. Because they can hedge positions they can use options in the background to just kind of hedge. So what is important the US user you just sign permit do you sign a message, you send it in a network and you don't pay any gas with the execution.
00:15:43.370 - 00:16:37.610, Speaker A: Of course there are some gas costs, market makers resolvers need to execute it somehow on smaller amounts. If you use fusion, you would just get a little bit less destination token. For example, if you're exchanging ethereum to USDC, you would get just a little bit less USDC because the rate would be worser than if you execute by yourself. But anyway, you get the same if you send your transaction a legacy mode by yourself, you do this aggregation thing by yourself. You pay the gas cost in ethereum and in a fusion mode, resolver pays the gas cost and they take into account how much they pay and if it's profitable for them. If it's not profitable, of course no one will take it. But we set the orders, we have presets, we set specific price ranges in the terms that it's executed very fastly.
00:16:37.610 - 00:17:40.158, Speaker A: So map protection, I said already how that works, how to integrate the fusion itself we have a nice SDK written JavaScript I'm sorry, if someone would like to contribute to write SDK in other languages you are welcome to ask for a grant. We have a nice dow and 18 millions of US dollars dow to distribute for those people who contribute to oneish network you can write in Python for example so how to get a quote? It's simple. You use the SDK, this nice method get quote. You form your request and you get the quote. What is the current market rate? Market return of the token pair and the amount you would like to exchange. So that means you can just easily build an UI which is maybe more user friendly than ours. Or you built a specific product which use fusion under the hood to maybe rebalance a bundle of assets or something so you can place a order.
00:17:40.158 - 00:18:17.114, Speaker A: It's also very easy SDK with the proper endpoint network. We have also nice documentation. I will show you where to find it. You can get all orders. Maybe you can build something what analyze orders or maybe filters the orders based on specific criteria. Or you build an explorer for one each network like fusion Explorer. It's also one thing what you can get maybe a grant here and also you can apply maybe for a grant at the Dow to work on that maybe full time.
00:18:17.114 - 00:18:39.694, Speaker A: So you can scan the QR code, you will get the documentation and I have still a little bit time. I would like to show you how it works and of course you can get in touch with us anytime. We are also here downstairs on the ground level. We have above. You're welcome to come also to get such chips. I come a little bit later distribute. There are some one inch tops.
00:18:39.694 - 00:19:19.230, Speaker A: So you can play around with the fusion mode and exchange it in fully gasless manner. So I will show you how it works. So, we have here our one inch and I would like to use our one inch wallets to connect. So now I need to find a proper wallet. One SEC. Yeah, this one. And we can use one inch wallet connect so very easy connected.
00:19:19.230 - 00:20:31.510, Speaker A: And now I have some uniswap tokens which I would like to sell and I would maybe sell it to USDC. So by default we have legacy mode because on smaller amounts you can send the transaction by yourself, pay for the gas costs and you will not face the MAF attack because it's not profitable for the maps under estimated $1,000. But anyway, if you have no ethereum on your wallet, you can still perform the trade because uni supports permit. Permit is just allowance signature which you give from your wallet and we will do it now. So we have auto mode which is in three minutes, the expression time is in three minutes, which takes into account the gas costs for the arbitrage, for the resolvers the arbitrage traders. So we ensure that that rate will be executed. So I get the notification that I have to give a permission and now I have to sign this swap.
00:20:31.510 - 00:21:42.406, Speaker A: And you see here we have pending status, we have expiration time, we have three minutes something. We give like 20 seconds for people to sign because sometimes people are slow, they need to use ledger or other hardware wallets and it should be executed in next 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure. So you see, you will receive at least 529 USDC because gas costs right now are very expensive on ethereum. Of course we are supporting other networks, so you can work with other networks. We have Arbitrum where you don't pay a lot of money. So in meantime, as long as it's in a pending process compared to legacy mode, if you send the transaction by yourself anyway, you have to wait sometimes if you use market gas price, you wait maybe 30 seconds until the transaction is included in the block. So it's similar here for small amounts, for bigger amounts you have huge profit like huge benefits by using fusion how already explained.
00:21:42.406 - 00:23:05.666, Speaker A: We have nice doc portal, you can find it here under more documentation and you get kind of deeper insights, how it's set up, how that works, how to became a resolver and we have also nice SDK repository, you can also walk through all the examples, real examples. There are some auction calculators to the bounties so we have the first task where we say we would like to see someone to build on top of oneish fusion integrate it how you want asset rebalancing mechanism swap interface integrating one of your products which you already have built somewhere, I don't care. So for me it's important that fusion is integrated and used somewhere where it makes sense. We have also this thing with the resolvers, which I explained oh, no. Actually, we were hearing this sound I didn't recognize. We have this magic sound when it's filled. So it's filled and we got $549.
00:23:05.666 - 00:23:40.590, Speaker A: And it's a little bit below than five nine five. Because it was unprofitable for anyone to take this aura because they had to pay the gas costs. The money is not coming from nowhere. Someone need to pay in any time. But compared to what? If you do it by yourself, you trade by yourself, you pay anyway the guest cost, so it's comfortable in the case. Also, when you have no ethereum on your wallet. So to the second task we have our resolvers.
00:23:40.590 - 00:24:57.240, Speaker A: You can stake one inch tokens, you can lock up to two years with locking by two years you get almost one to one inch token to one unicorn power and it decrease in the time and then you can delegate to the resolvers. There are already some you can also create by your own sum but of course you need a lot of delegation power. So we have here top ten and top ten they have 270,000 unicorn power delegated. So 200,000 of onishteps you need theoretically but you can ask the community, you can ask core contributors as well to delegate to you if you would like to participate here. You don't need really money, you just need support from people. So we have this delegation and these people, these companies who run the resolver, they distribute kind of incentives for people who delegate to them. So it makes no sense for me to delegate to someone just like that.
00:24:57.240 - 00:25:22.714, Speaker A: Here you see apr how many? One ish tokens. Resolvers, distribute. And based on this apr, most of the people delegate the tokens to earn on that. You can build something on top of this. You can tokenize, maybe these positions you can create. Maybe pool. That the thing is, every time when I delegate and when I claim the tokens, I need to pay gas.
00:25:22.714 - 00:25:56.966, Speaker A: And it's painful on ethereum right now, since the meme coins. So maybe a good solution would be to create a smart contract, which is kind of pool. Everyone can participate. Like bring on one inch tokens. This contract can stake and delegate for specific resolver and also move the delegation based on the Apr and also claim rewards and distribute rewards for those who participate. So this could be one of cool ideas what you can build here. And we have really nice prices.
00:25:56.966 - 00:26:44.822, Speaker A: So for the fusion integration for the first place you can get $4,000. It's a lot back to my times I was lucky to get Ethereum New York I got on $350 to be able to pay the airplane ticket to Stutgart back when we have built one inch. But nowadays it's really nice to see that also other projects offer nice bounties which you can really easily earn by just not sleeping today's. Yeah, and the open track just come with what you think. I can give you some example. I'm running out of time. We are working on PTP network PTP Network for storing usefulized mana limit orders like mesh network and fusion orders.
00:26:44.822 - 00:27:04.890, Speaker A: And if you build something like this on Hackathon or tonight I would appreciate and you can see a nice bounty for $2,500. Thank you very much. If you have any questions, I will stay outside. We have here booth. You can also come to our booth and speak with us as well. Thank you very much. It was a pleasure.
00:27:04.890 - 00:27:06.200, Speaker A: Thank.
