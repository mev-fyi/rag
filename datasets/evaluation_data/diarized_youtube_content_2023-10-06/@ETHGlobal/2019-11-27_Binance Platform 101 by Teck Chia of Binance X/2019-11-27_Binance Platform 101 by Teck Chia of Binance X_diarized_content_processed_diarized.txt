00:00:08.300 - 00:00:30.970, Speaker A: I'll start. I'm Tech. I run binance X. If you're at the opening ceremony yesterday, I talked a little about Binance X. It's a new initiative developer facing trying to foster innovation on the Binance platform. Today I'm just going to talk about the Binance platform, which is a bunch of products that developer facing, that development can build. Done.
00:00:30.970 - 00:01:09.920, Speaker A: And yeah, I'm Steve, based in Waterloo. I was an Eto and I live in Waterloo, based out in Toronto a lot of the time. So I just come to YT code. I just try to figure out what's going on, what's coming up. Standpoint cannot take you into NFT. So, like Denver?
00:01:11.380 - 00:01:12.130, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:15.300 - 00:01:20.320, Speaker A: I'm well, I work firm.
00:01:45.220 - 00:01:50.876, Speaker C: My name is Dustin. I'm a freelancer doing centralized finance projects.
00:01:50.988 - 00:01:51.408, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:51.494 - 00:01:57.996, Speaker C: I was also in Toronto for a couple months, but now I'm back in Philly. I also do some technical writing digitally.
00:01:58.108 - 00:02:01.990, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Are you here for that?
00:02:02.360 - 00:02:04.070, Speaker B: I'm here for you. Okay.
00:02:05.800 - 00:02:07.444, Speaker A: Yeah. Because they're so small.
00:02:07.642 - 00:02:30.620, Speaker B: Sure. I'm Christiana, I work primarily in Asia. I travel to all events. Basically I work on adoption campaigns. So cities or festivals or kind of either micro or macro. How to adopt crypto usage.
00:02:31.040 - 00:03:03.700, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Binance platform consists of Binance chain which is all called the Dex, the.com APIs, which you might be interested in, the Trust Wallet, which is wallet they acquired last July that has open source, what they call the core FDA and the two other things that people can develop on. And then we have the Binary Charity platform, binary Charity Foundation which uses the blockchain.
00:03:03.700 - 00:03:18.910, Speaker A: I don't know which part of the Binance platform you guys want to learn. I know you might be interested in.com APIs. I mean I already know. Please. You already know. Okay.
00:03:18.910 - 00:04:06.140, Speaker A: You know about futures and margins that are coming up. We just announced just latest, greatest news. We just announced two futures products. One was acquired in called Jax. And we are kind of having this trading competition to kind of gauge community interest in either one of them to see which one people have interest in. It just literally started a few days ago and then we have a margin product since a few weeks ago or is it a few months ago? Probably a few weeks ago where people can leverage their trades using margin. And also we are going to have a lending product which is margin, I guess lending.
00:04:06.140 - 00:04:46.520, Speaker A: So on the.com exchange side, we're innovating just kind of having more products that are more comprehensive for traders, futures that are towards derivatives which into the big max space. And then I guess this year, earlier this year we launched the Binance chain, which is a public chain that has native Dex functionality. So to date it has already become the largest decentralized exchange in the space by many times by at least an order. I get you to the next competitor. I can go through that. Are you guys interested in binance.
00:04:46.520 - 00:06:00.774, Speaker A: So this agenda will go through the binance overview, some tips and tricks. We are RP Boston Pride boston Pride and so Binance is based on the Tenermint consensus and still using a modified version of the Cosmos SDK, which means that it has similar characteristics as the Cosmos Hub or any Cosmos hub. You build a Cosmos SDK, it has one plus second block confirmation and finale. So final block every second. And each block is kind of small, less than 1 TPS is kind of recorded in thousands per second. This is something we want to kind of keep performance because the decks to go trader, you need a fast settlement, you need the performance for traders to even consider trading on Kazakhst, the same as Bitcoin. We're currently not open source yet.
00:06:00.774 - 00:06:41.030, Speaker A: We've been live on mainnet for about four months now. The reason I think CD didn't want to open source because our competitors are trying to come up with their own decks and if we open source now, they could easily just walk in. CD wants to see more innovation in the space, so forcing them to build their own. So that's one of the reasons why having open source. But the intent is to open source it once it's good and ready for the space to have. So right now we have binaries on GitHub and it's the link. So just GitHub.com
00:06:41.030 - 00:07:44.086, Speaker A: finance, like I said, it may not slide. So Tenement, if you don't know, is a PDF consensus algorithm. It has validator nodes that produce blocked and voter proposals. Today we run on validators and in the future we'll have the same model that most costumes have where people save the dollars. Right now it's us for now we'll kind of have that model over time. And there's a bunch of nodes that are what we call witness nodes and these are like nodes you can run yourself, either light nodes that can do full nodes, or you can run full nodes that actually have full nodes that have the entire chain under local hard drive. And then we have what we call accelerated nodes, which are nodes that we want next to the validators or very close to the validator you can connect to directly.
00:07:44.086 - 00:08:47.180, Speaker A: It's kind of like you can think of it like an infuria service, you can just connect it and do stuff with it without running the governance, as I said. So yeah, there's on chain governance and off chain governance is how we kind of improve the chain and we go through the same thing as most other chains do, which is go through community proposal process. We call it finance evolution proposal. BP B-I-P is taken by bitcoin. So BP, either one of these three things feature request recruitment. So the bat two, the second standard. So bat one is kind of a meta which describes what Bet is, and the bat two is the token standard, which describes what a token on the binary chain should have basically all the interface that it should have kind of ERC 20.
00:08:47.180 - 00:09:48.882, Speaker A: And for on chain governance, we have two things that Valley is broken on today. You get some proposal to issue a token and then valid is vote on it to see whether you can issue a token. And then the other thing is to list a token listing means you're putting up a trading pair on the decks. Today I think you can propose trading pairs against BNB, which are a native token on the chain, as well as BTCD, which is a bitcoin kind of like a wrap bitcoin on finance as well as a bus. So you can kind of go to this link or finance to see what are the guidelines of how to list token magic. So far we have about 60, 70 tokens. Kind of issued a lot of them actually.
00:09:48.936 - 00:09:50.210, Speaker B: I just saw the latest.
00:09:51.350 - 00:09:53.410, Speaker A: Okay. Sorry. I'm super updated.
00:09:54.070 - 00:09:56.706, Speaker B: And then the trading pair is 94.
00:09:56.888 - 00:10:33.950, Speaker A: Okay, 139 and 94. So we're going pretty quickly. So a lot of the ERG 20 app had migrated over to kind of take advantage of the liquidity on the dance as well, centralized exchange. So the Bat two standard basically has these four things that you need to implement, which issue token, transfer, token free time, freeze, mint and burn. Basically create a standard thing when you want to. And then the dex functionality is native to the chain. It has orders where you can do, buy, sell, cancel.
00:10:33.950 - 00:11:33.404, Speaker A: All them are limit orders. And the matching logic I think has changed. We did a hard fork that has changed to something better and you can look at the latest greatest, like I said, you can propose trading pairs and validates go to the side and this outdated this was done in New York, but now we support more, quote, assets other than BNB. The fees are fixed and we have revised it as the price of BNB went up. So there's a fee table somewhere. So if you're trying to evolve on the binding chain, these are some of the tips and tricks they can kind of take advantage of going from easy to hard. I guess the easiest just is to hit up the accelerated nodes and use that rest API to do stuff.
00:11:33.404 - 00:12:09.746, Speaker A: And then you can also stream data from the know WebSockets API. And then you can also we have a bunch of SDKs that are written either by us or by the community. It's expanded way beyond these languages now. And then of course, you can run your own node and just hit your own node and you can run the binaries. Like I said, we support a lot of wallets. We have our own web wallet on binance.org. You can create a wallet there.
00:12:09.746 - 00:12:48.980, Speaker A: And then we have Trustwallet, which is our non custodial wallet on mobile. I think we support native trading on Trustwallet now and ledger cool wallet and a few others. So in order to evolve, you need some testnet coins. So you need to have at least one BNB in your Binance.com account, and you can request for the test NetCoIn or you don't have any one BNB account or a finance account. You can just contact us on Discord. We'll send you some.
00:12:48.980 - 00:13:56.820, Speaker A: For this hackathon, we have a set RP published on Biasx Dev, which is our website. Beyond these RPS, like I said, we're very open to other ideas as long as it kind of got this perspective around building something that other people want to use, either developers or users. So feel free to hit us up on Discord and discuss. These are some of the way you can interact with the community, e bosses, the Discord chat, and then in general, the financial community discusses stuff on the forum community binance.org. There's a Telegram channel, and then they have a Twitter as well. So for this hackathon, we are just giving out fellowship. And let me talk a little bit about the Binance Fellowship program.
00:13:56.820 - 00:14:44.360, Speaker A: It's a program that we started in April this year to support open source development in crypto. And we want to see more building blocks that are free and open to use for other developers or the community. So we came up with this scholarship grant program where the only requirement to get the grant is that the output of your work has to be open source and openly accessible. So if it's research, it has to be open, published, and accessible by people. If it's like a software, you have to be on GitHub. So we have onboarded around 40 plus projects so far. If you go to this link, you'll see some of the fellows with onboard.
00:14:44.360 - 00:15:37.730, Speaker A: Some notable ones are like we don't necessarily just give out grants for finance related projects. The first few projects are actually grid related. So we give grants to Irene, which is like a grid wallet, mobile wallet, grin Swap, which is Atomic swap with E Sense Grin, which is also a grin project, and a lot of Ethereum stuff as well. But lately we have been spending a lot of finance related. Yeah, that's the end of the quick overview of Banishing. If you have any questions and you want, you can sign up for insider. Any questions, you can ask anything.
00:15:37.730 - 00:15:39.490, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:15:40.440 - 00:15:57.130, Speaker D: All right, is there a way to have smart contracts operate on bias chains? Let's say we wanted to have.
00:15:59.740 - 00:16:00.196, Speaker A: Smart.
00:16:00.228 - 00:16:09.820, Speaker D: Contract only give you binance coin when certain set of conditions are met. But I don't want to have to run a separate central server.
00:16:13.120 - 00:16:13.708, Speaker A: Outside of.
00:16:13.714 - 00:16:17.804, Speaker D: Finance server or the network, right? Is that possible?
00:16:17.922 - 00:17:31.110, Speaker A: So we don't support smart contract at this point. We do have a proposal called Bet Three that supports HTLC Atomic pegging to other chains, especially Ethereum Chain, where you could potentially send over or peg your token on buying chain to ethereum, do some smart contracts there and then come back. It's a trusted bridge, so it's not a trusted thing yet, but you can do that with Bat Three, which is going to be implemented this month actually on the main net. So for now there's no native smart contracts on the finance chain. The reason is because we have to keep the native Dex functionality really performing. So any additional kind of delay and state transition is not going to help the core functionality, which you want to keep very performing. But in the future if we find a way to do smart contracts while maintaining the performance of the DAX, then yeah, we'll definitely but for now, yeah, it's going to be like using other chains to do smart contract stuff.
00:17:31.720 - 00:17:50.250, Speaker D: All right, so will it be acceptable for now if we submit idea to have a proposal that would use maybe an external central server but could later be adapted into a smart contract system?
00:17:51.100 - 00:18:20.070, Speaker A: Yeah, potentially. I mean that's a trusted smart contract execution program, so you have to trust that they're executing correctly. So then the assumptions that whatever you do is like the conditions for how you kind of yeah, it's basically like instead of going to Ethereum where you trust it, you're going to a centralized server that's definitely until you finish your smart contract platform.
00:18:21.160 - 00:18:25.700, Speaker D: Well, you talked about linking to other smart contract platforms in the meantime.
00:18:25.860 - 00:18:41.870, Speaker A: Right. That's harder to do. Definitely. Because you need a bridge. You need yeah, for now I think you can just hack it, say, hey, assume go to Ethereum, what are you doing for it? Can we say?
00:18:42.400 - 00:18:48.204, Speaker D: Well, it's just like anything that releases BNB when certain sets of conditions are met.
00:18:48.242 - 00:18:48.540, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:48.610 - 00:18:51.244, Speaker D: This is the basics of any smart contract.
00:18:51.292 - 00:18:51.890, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:53.220 - 00:18:55.168, Speaker D: We have to establish some way to.
00:18:55.174 - 00:18:56.800, Speaker A: Do that before we can do anything.
00:18:56.950 - 00:18:57.648, Speaker D: Really?
00:18:57.814 - 00:20:20.616, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean the idea is that binance chain has the Dex functionality, that's the core feature. And then if you want to do anything that's like smart contracts, you do it, at least for now, you do it on external chain or in a trusted kind of environment. Yeah, go ahead and do that for detaching them because it's like block times for like a second. Has that been fast enough for trades? Is that fast enough for traders? Do you count me, your trader? Ultimately not really fast enough. Ultimately if you're thinking about different solutions to that potentially using something like scale or something, yeah, they are all considering everything. I personally believe that layer two is the way to scale, which basically runs a paradigm you trust the idea of you don't because other kind of decent trustless way to do it is you just hit a wall somewhere. Yeah, we're considering all possibilities, but now we're like woman's in and so far I think the serious sharing still on the central exchange.
00:20:20.616 - 00:20:47.450, Speaker A: The liquidity is still there until we build up like very deep liquidity on the decks and people are serious about trading on a deck then they are. Yeah. I totally agree. Any other question? It doesn't have to be a binance chain. It can be anything.
00:20:49.580 - 00:20:50.520, Speaker B: Venus.
00:20:51.260 - 00:20:56.148, Speaker A: Venus. What about Venus?
00:20:56.324 - 00:21:00.756, Speaker B: What about Venus? I haven't heard much. I just had rumors.
00:21:00.948 - 00:21:05.950, Speaker A: Yeah. So we're keeping it kind of like vain for now.
00:21:08.240 - 00:21:13.132, Speaker B: Oh, it's like the answer to Libra. Answer to Libra.
00:21:13.276 - 00:21:57.100, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. Initiative to kind of engage Fiat currencies to kind of issue stable coins. So moving backwards. What's that? Isn't that moving backwards? Isn't the reason why we're all doing this is to get away from that crap? Sure. Yeah. I would say I agree with you. Some people see as moving forward is a step forward because it is still kind of issuing a digital currency, kind of which is beyond that depends on your perspective.
00:21:57.100 - 00:22:11.570, Speaker A: Some people think it's a small step towards where we want to be. I know all of us here want to just go decentralized and scoop with Fiat people. Well, it seems like we're entering we're bringing them back into this when we're trying to kick their ass out of it.
00:22:12.180 - 00:22:25.524, Speaker B: It's kind of like strategy. It's like adoption bridge. How do we engage all masses? You got to have the Trojan horror. So you got to do what you got to do. I think there's compromise that has to be made.
00:22:25.642 - 00:22:39.108, Speaker A: I don't know. I disagree with that, but either way yeah, there's different perspective. One perspective you cannot disrupt something you're trying to call up. Something you're trying to disrupt. Right. Like Uber. Wouldn't be Uber today if they actually call out the testing.
00:22:39.108 - 00:22:55.240, Speaker A: That's one perspective. Another perspective is like Trojan towards hey, take it one step at a time. Baby steps towards whatever. Who knows what's going to work. So we're taking all steps. Yeah. Venus, if you're interested.
00:22:55.240 - 00:23:35.456, Speaker A: What's the email? Do you remember Venus@binance.com? Someone will get back to you. Just send an email there. Do you have any idea what your market share against MetaMask and Coinbase are for DApps? MetaMask, as far as the wall that's being used if trust is used for DApps as well. Do you have any idea what kind of market share you have for oh, I don't I have no idea. I'm sure Metamass is like I was going to say, they have to have the bulk between the three. Yeah, they have the bulk because they're in the browser for mobile stuff.
00:23:35.456 - 00:24:10.810, Speaker A: You have to use wallet connection there. Yes. The iOS still live because MetaMask iOS app yeah, it's still legit. Yeah. I think that's something that the contestants have to solve because that friction can bending a lot of adoption. Yes. You had a question about something? No, I was just asking if you knew the market check against that.
00:24:10.810 - 00:25:01.434, Speaker A: No, I think Trustwallet because I think at this point it's the wallet with the most number of chains supported mainly because of the Trustwallet core that we open source where chains could just integrate their own chains with Trustwallet themselves and just rebate to our main app. And then we're done with integration. We don't have to do it ourselves. And that's one of the reasons why we open source. And I think now it's wallet that will never change. Who is building on finance? Okay, you are. OKAY.com.
00:25:01.434 - 00:25:02.898, Speaker A: APIs or finance chain?
00:25:03.014 - 00:25:27.240, Speaker C: So I was thinking of doing something with the smart contracts where I would source liquidity from Binance and then it would restore an account that would trade on behalf of the user using a smart contract. But seeing if you guys don't have smart contracts, I think I'll just use the API and simulate okay on the yeah.
00:25:39.200 - 00:25:48.370, Speaker A: I'm very interested in what you do around adoption. What kind of activities or initiatives are you okay?
00:25:49.940 - 00:26:18.648, Speaker B: Right now we're on the ground in Amsterdam. It's just grassroots, to be honest. It's just painstaking. So I used to do kind of more like online customer acquisition, bulk kind of deadline users type of stuff. And then I realized for crypto, it's not going to work like that. We have to have the online campaigns and we have to have the offline painstaking work. So we kind of do hybrid models of that.
00:26:18.648 - 00:27:16.840, Speaker B: So we target let's say events or festivals where they're going to have maybe 5000 ticketed people or more. So whenever there's a ticketed event, it could be a festival south by Southwest Coachella or these conferences as well because we're inside the network, right? You have a ticketed event. And then how can we leverage ticketed humans like Celsius has? They'll send you Celsius with text messages. Well, if we have 5000 person events and everyone put in their cell phone number, everyone can get some kind of coin, $10, everybody gets it, right? And then we design kind of like a digital experience to say, okay, everybody got this coin. Everyone who got a ticket got this coin. Go to this area. You can play a game, you can get a beer, you can get a snack, right? So that's incentivizing.
00:27:16.840 - 00:28:13.790, Speaker B: You just got coins and you're going to use it now, right? So we do that kind of stuff and with those events we're able to test it's not a silver bullet, it's not a full loop, but it is going to be like, okay, so they got this coin, they now have it, they're brand new user. When will they delete it? How can we keep them active in it? And then creating methods for that. And then Amsterdam, we're getting ready to do like a promotion week and we're onboarding a bunch of restaurants and then the next web summit or the next big fintech conference will do that promotion. And then the restaurants that are taking crypto will have incentives for against the ticketed attendees. So it's just kind of like step by step. But we're always leveraging large scale events so that we can get new onboarded, new users and then track kind of like the data of their experience.
00:28:14.960 - 00:28:16.648, Speaker A: How do you get the restaurants?
00:28:16.744 - 00:29:00.456, Speaker B: Where do you pitch the restaurant? So for now, we're not trying to do our kind of theory is that we are going to give people what they need, not give them the whole education. So we use partners that give them off ramp to get beyond again, compromising. Right? Because we can't teach everybody everything. So for what we do is for a merchant, it's very simple. Can I make more money? Right? And we're saying we're promoting you within the space. We're bringing on incentives specifically for this one promote Motion week where people are going to go to your restaurant because they get a deal. We're giving them free promotion and they can get the Fiat off ramp.
00:29:00.456 - 00:29:02.030, Speaker B: So it's not a risk for them.
00:29:04.080 - 00:29:12.330, Speaker A: Interesting. I think we're outside. Thank you.
