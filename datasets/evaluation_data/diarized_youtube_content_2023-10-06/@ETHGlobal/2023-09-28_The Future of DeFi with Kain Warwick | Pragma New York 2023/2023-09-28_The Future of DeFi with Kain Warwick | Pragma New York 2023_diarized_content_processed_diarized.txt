00:00:07.210 - 00:00:37.400, Speaker A: So for our next interview, I want to bring on Kane, who you may all know as one of the co founders of Synthetics. And if you were early enough, as the co founders of Haven, we're going to talk about sort of how the DeFi landscape has evolved so far. Kind of what are the things that we're seeing or things we should be excited about, or things that kind of are not going so well, and kind of everything in between for how this space is evolving. So, without further ado, please join me in welcoming Kane from Synthetics. Thanks for making it.
00:00:38.970 - 00:00:40.360, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:41.690 - 00:01:33.260, Speaker A: Since I was prepping for what we want to talk about here, I ended up having five different things that end up sort of changing topics halfway. So we're going to cover whatever we can and we'll try to see if they all fit together at the end of the day. But mostly I want to start by talking about how DeFi has changed. I mean, it's not what I thought it was five years ago, and in a good and a bad way, that's not kind of what we were pitched when everything started. That's not really what we see is consistently persisting either. We're seeing so much experimentation for better, some of them are just small, some of them are impressively, amazing engineering changes. So I guess I'm curious about what you think, in retrospect, what the last three years have been and what do you think DeFi looks like now, or where it's going?
00:01:34.030 - 00:02:31.514, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a big topic, I suppose, right. So I think probably the primary change in DFI over the last, say, twelve to 18 months, is the fact that we now have layer twos. So we've got multiple production layer twos that you can build on that allow us to do things that were just not possible on L One. Even back in the day when we were like sub one guay transactions, there was just stuff that was not possible, right? Like too much complexity in transactions, et cetera. So I think that that is fundamentally unlocking that additional computation has really changed things and allowed people to do a bunch of stuff that we couldn't do. For me, the primary thing, I guess, in Synthetics is allowing for a bunch of new perps protocols to emerge, just something that we couldn't do on L One. And we tried and it didn't work out very well and we learned that lesson.
00:02:31.514 - 00:03:23.454, Speaker B: So that's something that I think in the bear market, looking at the potential for product market fit is one of the biggest opportunities that we know that there are still a ton of users who are living on centralized exchanges, binance, buybit, et cetera. And the notional volume is in the tens of billions per day. And if you look at DEXes, it's like sub a billion dollars. So there's like a 50 x opportunity kind of sitting there for whoever is going to be able to put that together. And I think that we've got probably three or four solid contenders for figuring that out. And right now, in the bear market, the name of the game, I guess, in DeFi is trying to capture the existing users who are already here because there aren't too many new users showing up. It's awesome to see all of these faces here.
00:03:23.454 - 00:04:27.038, Speaker B: You guys are obviously still hanging around for some reason, but we don't really have a large influx of new users, right? So tapping into CFI and Lending is a great example, right. All of the CFI lenders blew themselves up over the last 18 months, which is awesome. And so now there's an opportunity in DFI Lending, I think, to capture some of those users and figure that out. And so we're seeing the emergence of DeFi combined with real world assets, some kind of weird C DeFi solution. But I think that that's a big opportunity as well. And so I think there's a ton of things that have either not been possible or have taken a lot of work to get to a point where they're now viable. And so when I look around at kind of the DFI infrastructure today versus say, 2018, 2019, or even into DFI Summer in 2020, I see that we now actually have feature parity with a lot of the CFI or TradFi solutions.
00:04:27.038 - 00:04:48.920, Speaker B: And so then the real question is, okay, cool, if we've got feature parity across a number of different protocol types, what is stopping us from getting users, right? And I think that's the kind of adoption question of how do we actually take it to the next step and focus on user acquisition, user experience, things like that, because the infrastructure is there now.
00:04:50.650 - 00:05:10.400, Speaker A: That's an amazing kind of perspective. I think it ends up touching on a couple of things I want to talk about. Maybe one follow up question to that is kind of from a personal perspective for you. Is the DeFi that we have now the same DeFi that the definition that you thought we had back in DeFi Summer or four years ago?
00:05:11.810 - 00:06:02.766, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is. I mean, let's not forget a lot of what DeFi Summer was, was like crazy yield farming Pozzi schemes, right? And so there wasn't a lot of sustainability there. And the transition from crazy Ponzi schemes in DFI 1.0 that were really driven by kind of weird growth hacks, some utility, but combined with a lot of growth hacking and DFI growth hacks. I think what we're seeing now is the transition to sort of real yield, if you will, right, or revenue generating protocols. So there's a ton of protocols out there that were making no money back in 2020, and now they're actually making significant revenue. Potentially they're profitable, whatever that means in DFI, right? But they make more money than they burn or something like that.
00:06:02.766 - 00:06:10.914, Speaker B: And some of them even pay token holders. So I think there's a significant shift there in terms of the sustainability of what's happening.
00:06:10.952 - 00:06:12.430, Speaker A: It's not just maturity altogether.
00:06:12.510 - 00:06:13.380, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:06:15.590 - 00:06:45.162, Speaker A: Would it be fair to say that effectively what we think about DFI now is that, look, this is feature parity because of L two S, and we're kind of able to do a lot of things that traditional finance does from, like, the set of products. And our goal is to just get that same audience to switch so that we have better guarantees. But at the end of the day, it's the same one to one mapping just on a better network. Or do you actually think there's still some opportunity to kind of do things or offer products that are just not possible in traditional finance?
00:06:45.306 - 00:07:13.190, Speaker B: I think there's absolutely the possibility of kind of making novel things. Right. I think uniswap is a novel thing that TradFi can't absolutely. Right. The ability for a bunch of people to kind of come together who don't know each other and provide liquidity into an AMM and facilitate trades is just not something that TradFi really can contemplate or do. So we do have novel solutions out there. I think that there are some things that we can't do yet.
00:07:13.190 - 00:07:19.286, Speaker B: Right. Like, we're not able to issue mortgages on chain, which is something that I think would be pretty but that falls.
00:07:19.318 - 00:07:22.554, Speaker A: Into the technically possible operationally not yes. Yeah.
00:07:22.592 - 00:07:27.580, Speaker B: I mean, there's a component, I guess, of like social consensus. Right.
00:07:27.950 - 00:07:29.260, Speaker A: Want to yeah.
00:07:31.310 - 00:07:51.330, Speaker B: If we're going to do mortgages, houses, unfortunately live in the real world. Right. We haven't been able tokenize them in a way that is sensible. Right. So houses are a thing that is a physical object, and ultimately you're going to have to resolve ownership of a house via courts or violence. Right. Like at the absolute base level.
00:07:51.330 - 00:07:52.914, Speaker B: Right. Guns. Right.
00:07:52.952 - 00:07:56.558, Speaker A: Someone it's not like you lose your private key and suddenly you can't get into your door anymore.
00:07:56.654 - 00:08:31.374, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. Thankfully, otherwise we don't probably be sleeping on the street. But there's kind of this idea of like, okay, how do we tokenize this thing or fractionalize it or create some weird derivative or something like that that allows us to bring the real world on chain. And I was very bearish on RWAs for a really long time, but I do think that we're now getting to a point where there's, like, enough social consensus to start to see these things being brought on chain. Right. And one of the other shifts, I think, is the interest rate environment as well.
00:08:31.374 - 00:08:57.800, Speaker B: Right. In a zero interest rate environment, there's no yield. In the real world, all of a sudden, now you have assets that have genuine yield, some of which are bare assets. And so, you know, those kinds of things are easier to tokenize or make more sense or whatever. So I do think that we're seeing, like, some macro shifts, but also like a social consensus that real world assets can actually be brought on chain and we can find ways to manage them and wrap them up in a sensible way.
00:08:58.490 - 00:09:41.622, Speaker A: That's a multitrillion dollar market. So I hope it works out because that is a lot of opportunity. One thing you kind of said, which I definitely agree with, is just that L two S in the last 15 to 18 months have made a lot of this easier and possible. I'm kind of curious about, from your perspective, do you think we're just going to keep seeing different DeFi apps spin out to their own new chains? Because that's kind of what it trends to. If you have a notion of having a yield and revenue, then it kind of gives you a good argument for being separate so you can track that versus kind of sharing the pie. How are you going to think about that in a MultiChain world? Or just what comes to mind when you see these types of incentives here?
00:09:41.756 - 00:10:24.866, Speaker B: Yeah, I wrote about this recently, this idea of, let's say there's ten L two S or something like that. Right. And so if you have a protocol that is going to be deployed to all ten of these chains, which may or may not make sense right, depending on what you're doing. But if you believe that there are kind of distinct users on each of these chains and you want to be able to generate revenue or generate yield from all of the different chains, then you kind of need to deploy to all of them. And then there's this question of like, okay, having deployed to all of them, how do you collect the revenue? Where does it flow to? Which chain is going to be the core chain or whatever. And so I think that's where potentially we do start seeing DAP chains emerge. Right.
00:10:24.866 - 00:10:55.210, Speaker B: The problem that I see with Adapt chain that is like its own independent chain that's maybe collecting all the revenue or distributing it or something like that, is you do lose composability. So I think you need to be on the chains where there's liquidity, but maybe you have your own canonical chain that you sort of collect all of the revenue onto and then distribute it because it does get a little bit weird. One of the challenges is who earns the revenue on each chain? Is it just LPs if you're sharing with token holders? What does that look like? What's the split?
00:10:55.290 - 00:10:58.490, Speaker A: Upgrading something just governance altogether? It's chaotic.
00:10:58.570 - 00:11:28.118, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. It's very much an unsolved problem. So I do think that there is maybe a role to be played with an app chain to say, okay, here's the Credibly neutral chain where the governance token lives and where we do some kind of revenue distribution or token burns or whatever the method is. And that sits over here and maybe there's not even transactions happening on there. In the sense of the protocol isn't transacting or there isn't even liquidity there. The liquidity is actually spread across all the other generalized L2 S.
00:11:28.118 - 00:11:33.820, Speaker B: But I've got my specialized app chain that is doing my stuff, whatever that is.
00:11:34.510 - 00:11:42.300, Speaker A: Are you sort of answering this from the perspective of, this is how we can make it work, or are you saying that it probably shouldn't happen?
00:11:44.610 - 00:11:47.134, Speaker B: Well, I definitely don't want to go.
00:11:47.252 - 00:12:06.466, Speaker A: Is there a value in trying to make it work? Maybe let's answer it this way because fragmentation is a big deal, especially when you have money locked into these systems where it is a zero sum compared to, I guess, traditional finance, where you can kind of think of fractional liquidity. But it's not obvious, right? In the case of DeFi, it's not.
00:12:06.488 - 00:12:36.174, Speaker B: Are the Arbitrum guys still here? They left. All right, good. I'm sure they're monitoring everything that I say anyway. But I tried for a long time, right, when this original L2 war was kind of brewing, before anything had been deployed, to get everyone to agree to just deploy onto one chain, which was optimism. Obviously, that didn't work out very well for me. But the reality is that we're just past that point. There's no way to kind of get everyone to coordinate to deploy to one L2.
00:12:36.174 - 00:12:52.370, Speaker B: Now. I think we're going to see a proliferation of different L2 S. And again, maybe app chains and whatever. And it might be that we have five or ten that have meaningful liquidity base launching shifts that calculus even further. Right? Because Coinbase has their own users.
00:12:53.510 - 00:13:00.670, Speaker A: We're going to see like a general power law distribution of these five. Things are doing this, and then you have like, a long tail of weird behavior.
00:13:00.750 - 00:13:05.778, Speaker B: Yeah. And God help us if it works. Right? Because then you have Kraken chain and Buybit chain. I mean, Buybit already has mantle.
00:13:05.794 - 00:13:07.174, Speaker A: I guess finance already has one too.
00:13:07.212 - 00:13:36.706, Speaker B: Yeah, they've got their own l two. So every centralized exchange has an L2 and whatever. Right. So I don't think that it's possible to put the genie back in the bottle and get everyone to coordinate onto a single chain, which means we need to think about this. And for each D Five project, if we're talking just DFI, there's going to be sort of idiosyncratic challenges. Right? If you're uniswap, well, you don't pay fees to anyone, so that's not a problem for you. And you can just deploy sort of immutable code to any chain, which they.
00:13:36.728 - 00:13:38.142, Speaker A: Have in a lot of chains.
00:13:38.206 - 00:13:59.982, Speaker B: It's super easy. Right. Uniswap has done something in the way that they've approached the world that makes their lives much easier. Right. If you are synthetics or some other fairly complicated protocol that requires a lot of governance and upgrading, it just is much harder. It's not obvious how you share liquidity across chains. It's not obvious how you ensure fungibility of assets.
00:13:59.982 - 00:14:06.220, Speaker B: There's a whole bunch of challenges that are really unsolved, hence why we're still camped out on an optimism at the moment.
00:14:07.710 - 00:14:32.354, Speaker A: I'm going to do another tricky question here. Does EVM compatibility matter in this new world of how we see DeFi evolve? Do you have any thoughts on what happens here or what's happening here with dYdX moving away from Ethereum all twos? Is that a good thing? Do you have any comments you want to make? Do you think that works out or people don't care because they get the service figured out at the end of the day, and that's what they care about.
00:14:32.472 - 00:15:24.562, Speaker B: I mean, I'm pretty much bearish on everything that dYdX does and then proven wrong. So I don't know if I would necessarily listen to me on that. Maybe the Cosmos ecosystem is going to blow up and take over Ethereum. So I'm pretty skeptical of my own takes when it comes to dYdX. But I do think that we are in a position now where L ones are migrating to become Ethereum L2 S. We're seeing that narrative, right? And it just makes it much easier, I think if you're a ghost chain that's been operating for the last two or three years with minimal activity pivoting to be an Ethereum L2 is a pretty good narrative play, right? It's sort of tapping into that now. Maybe that makes it easier if you're say cosmos or polka dot or whatever to kind of hold strong, and there's only going to be two or three alt L ones left.
00:15:24.562 - 00:15:40.300, Speaker B: It might be like Salana and a couple of others, but it certainly feels like the EVM compatibility and being part of some kind of Ethereum L2 narrative is going to be pretty powerful this cycle. It feels like that's kind of where the momentum is, for sure.
00:15:40.670 - 00:15:58.750, Speaker A: That's great. I won't dig more in here. Where does Synthetix fit in all of this? What do you see the big opportunity or the direction DeFi is evolving or kind of from a product standpoint, what's the best correlation that you have to traditional finance?
00:15:59.090 - 00:16:33.258, Speaker B: So I think for synthetics, what I realized and I kind of hinted at this earlier, is that we actually have feature parity now with centralized exchanges. The liquidity is there. We've now got, I think, like 50 or 60 different markets. Obviously, finance and a few others have like 200, but a lot of them are denominated in different quote, assets or whatever. So having the top hundred assets or maybe the top 200 assets is pretty close to future parity. And so then the question is, okay, we have this now. This is working.
00:16:33.258 - 00:17:18.374, Speaker B: The liquidity is there. Why are we still doing a 50th or 100th of the volume of finance when finance is maybe on the point of implosion or something, right? If you believe crypto, Twitter, what is going on here? Why are people still doing tens of billions of dollars on Binance and not on dYdX or Synthetix or GMX or whoever. And the conclusion that I came to after kind of looking at from every angle, is that it is genuinely a user experience issue, right? It is onboarding. It's Bridging. Part of the problem, I think, is right at the time when we solved Perps DEXes, we solved it by going to L2 S, and the vast majority of liquidity was still sitting on L One. So it's like, hey guys, we've solved this. We're over here now.
00:17:18.374 - 00:18:17.130, Speaker B: And everyone's like, what are you talking about? I'm still on main net, right? And that made it really problematic to get users over there, and we ended up kind of fighting over the scraps of people that were willing to bridge Dell Two. So Bridging is a huge problem. There's a bunch of other things, but essentially what I realized is that we need to build a new front end for specifically synthetics, but probably the same goes for GMX or dYdX. That abstracts away all of that complexity. Removes the need to bridge, removes the need to get weird assets as margin, removes the need to even sign transactions, right? That you have an embedded browser key, also handles custody and account recovery and all of that stuff allows you to sign up with a username and password. There's a whole bunch of user experience things that we can do that will make the experience much closer to a centralized exchange. And that was sort of a pointless exercise when the liquidity was terrible, like when the core product didn't work.
00:18:17.130 - 00:18:30.334, Speaker B: There's no point building this nice, amazing layer on top of it, right? But it's only in the last kind of maybe six months that we've gone to the point where it's like, okay, we're there now, let's actually make sure people can use it. I guess.
00:18:30.372 - 00:18:52.422, Speaker A: One of the interesting pieces that I just picked up from what you said is, looks like you're not betting on people converting or getting their traditional fiat into on chain. The market is big enough that there's already enough liquidity on chain that they can just trade without needing a centralized exchange to do this thing. Is that like the core bet here, too?
00:18:52.476 - 00:18:58.466, Speaker B: I think that's the next six to twelve months, right? Like, there's no new users walking in this room with a pile of speed.
00:18:58.498 - 00:18:59.446, Speaker A: Especially not this year.
00:18:59.548 - 00:19:24.030, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Right. So the fiat conversion is really not the issue at the moment. Right. I think that there are a ton of people with a lot of assets on centralized exchanges right now that are doing whatever they can do on centralized exchanges and maybe have never done an on chain transaction other than moving assets between different centralized exchanges. Right. I think there's a lot of users out there and they're still transacting a lot.
00:19:24.030 - 00:19:49.734, Speaker B: Like, we're talking tens of billions of notional volume every single day. And so that, I think in the short term is the group of users that we should be targeting and trying to convert them off of centralized exchanges onto DEXes. The next step, once the market cycle sort of shifts, and maybe we're getting close to that, but I think it's still a ways away, is to ensure that we have fiat on ramps and that's the next layer of UX in my mind.
00:19:49.772 - 00:20:02.470, Speaker A: But that's important for somebody to take on and not really have those two camps of, hey, you figure out how to get on the centralized side and then once you have the money or the stable coins come back and then you can do stuff here.
00:20:02.560 - 00:20:34.518, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, just to be really clear, if we can convert the majority of users that are currently transacting only on centralized exchanges to DEXes, which I think is now technically possible, like from a functionality perspective, we can actually bring them over and it will be as good, if not better, for them to be on a Dex. If we can do that, then when a bunch of new users start falling out of the sky, which at some point they will, right? We need to make sure that they don't fall into someone's database. We need to make sure that they actually go into a Dex. And that is going to require some additional functionality that we don't have.
00:20:34.604 - 00:20:52.400, Speaker A: Right? And at the end of the day, if it's one to one experience, we would want them to use the thing that has all these better guarantees is this. I assume what Infinix is, and I guess what I'm curious on is what's kind of new about synthetics V Three that sort of helps you get there faster or just better.
00:20:52.770 - 00:21:32.618, Speaker B: So I think there are a number of things. So infinex is that UI layer, right? It's making this new user experience. That's the approach that we've taken in terms of synthetics V three. What we're enabling, in my mind, probably the biggest difference is permissionless markets. So in the past, synthetics has required significant governance overhead to add new markets, which means WorldCoin launches. And we want to have a world coin perp and it takes maybe two or three weeks by the time you've gone through the governance process. And if you want to build some novel financial instrument, you basically can't, right? There's almost no pathway to getting that done.
00:21:32.618 - 00:21:49.994, Speaker B: And so Synthetics Fee three will enable anyone to turn up and tap into Synthetics liquidity, of which there's a lot, and build some novel derivative. So as it stands now, if you want to build Squeath, for example, right, you need to build the entire protocol, maybe for audience.
00:21:50.042 - 00:21:51.598, Speaker A: Could you also describe what Squeath is?
00:21:51.684 - 00:22:24.266, Speaker B: It's basically a weird ETH derivative, right? If you want to build something that tracks the price of ETH, or even if you want like a leveraged ETH token or something as simple as that, right. You need to build the entire stack. You need to go through audits. You need to maybe have your own token to be able to pay people to add liquidity to it. There's an absolute huge amount of overhead to be able to do financial engineering still. Right, because in order to do that financial engineering, you need to have all the base stuff. Right? And so what we're saying with synthetics V Three is don't do any of that.
00:22:24.266 - 00:22:38.778, Speaker B: You can literally turn up tap into liquidity and you just need to do the financial engineering side and the rest of it. Synthetics will manage. And so I think that that's something that's going to be very interesting for people to play around with and it'll make experimentation much faster.
00:22:38.954 - 00:23:06.786, Speaker A: I mean, that sounds extremely powerful. This is like a leg up on composability, but on top of exactly engineering different derivatives and perps, you kind of talked about the slow governance process that kind of V Three, in a way, skips synthetics also is a really interesting governance way of doing governance with a council. Could you talk about sort of how you've set up governance and sort of how it differs from what other protocols have done and sort of why you made those trade offs?
00:23:06.978 - 00:23:37.102, Speaker B: Yeah. So we started from the standpoint of direct on chain voting. I e. Like Maker style voting is insane, right? Which I think it had been fairly well proven even before Maker did. You know, Maker does some weird stuff sometimes. So that was not really a viable path right, as far as we were concerned. But we also didn't want to have kind of some centralized decision making system, especially once we got rid of all of our entities.
00:23:37.102 - 00:24:04.006, Speaker B: So we deprecated the synthetics foundation. There are no legal entities at all that participate in synthetics governance, only token holders. That's it. So there's no foundation, there's no labs, there's nothing like that. It's literally pure token holders control what happens. And so we didn't want to have a centralized entity and we didn't want to have something that was like pure chaotic on chain governance. We wanted to find a middle ground.
00:24:04.006 - 00:24:28.306, Speaker B: And the way that we did that was to essentially set up delegated democracy so we have delegates. The difference between some other delegated democracy systems in crypto is that rather than having like an unbounded number of delegates, so you could have 1000 delegates with long tail distribution of governance power and the vast majority of them can't do anything. So you end up with maybe five.
00:24:28.328 - 00:24:29.602, Speaker A: Or just the top ten.
00:24:29.656 - 00:24:54.170, Speaker B: Yeah, the top ten that kind of make decisions. And the rest of them are kind of pointless is we basically said, okay, we're going to have a council that has seven seats or eight seats or five seats or whatever, and token holders vote for that council. And that council sits for an epoch which might be three months, four months, six months, a year, and those people are the representatives of their constituent token holders and they make the decisions.
00:24:54.910 - 00:25:02.250, Speaker A: How do you sort of measure if this is going well in this system? You just replace them if it's not because there's a fixed term or something else.
00:25:02.320 - 00:25:15.378, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, they get replaced every three or four months. I think the epochs are now four months. And in terms of how you measure whether it's going well, I guess it's difficult. Hopefully the protocol does rather it'll be.
00:25:15.384 - 00:25:23.586, Speaker A: Obvious what's slow and not well. But you don't get to benchmark this with any other model because no one is following the same thing.
00:25:23.688 - 00:25:43.606, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we can certainly look at other protocols and what their governance cadence is, I guess how kind of rapidly. And there's a few projects out there that track this, like the number of proposals that are passed or whatever. And I think Synthetics is up to 300 plus different proposals that are passed.
00:25:43.638 - 00:25:44.122, Speaker A: That's a lot.
00:25:44.176 - 00:25:57.680, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's over the last four years or whatever. So we are good at making bad decisions that need to be fixed and we're pretty fast at kind of deploying those new decisions and then replacing them with something else over time.
00:25:59.170 - 00:26:12.526, Speaker A: Would you recommend this as the path for someone else right now, trying to think about decentralized governance for their own protocols? Or do you have any better advice for how they can set up governance or take any lessons that you've learned since the council was introduced?
00:26:12.718 - 00:26:54.218, Speaker B: Yeah, so we started out with a single council and now there are five different councils and I think we're about to introduce a new one. So I think as a sort of new protocol, having most of the governance controlled in a single council makes a lot of sense. And letting them manage the treasury and deployments and even potentially contributor salaries and contributor payments, hiring, firing, et cetera. That kind of makes sense because as a sort of new protocol you have an expectation that specialization is going to be difficult. Like most people have most of the context over time. Though I do think that it makes sense to introduce specialization. That's what we've done in Synthetics.
00:26:54.218 - 00:27:01.230, Speaker B: So with infinex, we're going to have a single council that's going to be the starting point again. And it will govern contributors, it will govern the treasury.
00:27:01.310 - 00:27:05.310, Speaker A: So this is just a council to govern infinex, not synthetics related.
00:27:05.390 - 00:27:26.042, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So it's a separate council and we're doing some things in terms of how we control governance power. So synthetics token holders will get some governance power, but we're also going to do like a governance mining program, similar to like Yams, for example. There you go. We're bringing back the LD 100% exactly. D five somewhere, three now, or whatever we're up to.
00:27:26.042 - 00:27:53.154, Speaker B: And so the idea being that there are multiple different groups that need to have some say in governance. And traders is one of. Them. Right. And so we're allowing traders to connect read only API and basically prove that they are trading on Bybit or Binance or whatever and they'll be able to earn governance power and then they will have seats on the council to be able to hopefully have their voice heard.
00:27:53.272 - 00:28:18.550, Speaker A: That's a really cool incentive because you're literally proving that they're an active participant. Awesome. Another interesting point that you made, which I want to just maybe get a quick answer on. I don't want to go too deep into it, but you said that you got rid of all legal entities to kind of govern the feature of synthetics. Any advice to founders who want to think about doing the same thing, which is going from centralized to fully decentralized?
00:28:18.710 - 00:28:56.934, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this has become, I guess, a little more difficult question to answer. I think there's some precedent out there for the risks of not having any entities. I'm talking about ukidao. Right. I don't think that those precedents are great precedents necessarily. I think a lot of people over index on that and say like, oh, Ukidao, if you don't have an entity and you're pure, then someone's going to come after you and say you're an unincorporated corporation or partnership or whatever. The reality is that Ukidao could not really have fucked up as many things as they like.
00:28:56.934 - 00:29:18.394, Speaker B: They kind of maxed out how many things you could fuck up simultaneously. And so I think that that probably was more indicative of why they had legal issues than anything else. And so I think that when you don't have entities, the primary risk in my mind is like investor protection, that investors could come after you if someone buys a token.
00:29:18.442 - 00:29:19.818, Speaker A: So that means you're a personal liability.
00:29:19.914 - 00:29:45.974, Speaker B: Yeah, like personal liability there. Right. You don't really have that kind of investor coverage, the limited liability and potentially someone could come after you in that respect. Right. I think when you don't have entities and you are pure Dow and it is genuinely dao and you're not like just doing decentralization theater or LARPing is decentralized. Right. And it's great to see people like Arbitrum that have pushed it even further right.
00:29:45.974 - 00:30:19.202, Speaker B: Where there's like direct on chain deployments and all those sorts of things. I think you can't just be like, oh yeah, we've got a Dow and there's actually four people in a room. Exactly. It has to be really decentralized if you do that. I do think that over time you sort of accrue regulatory resistance to some extent, right. On the basis that a regulator, we already saw the SEC a long time ago say that Ethereum is sufficiently decentralized. Now that same organization depends on the month 100%.
00:30:19.202 - 00:30:49.900, Speaker B: Right. The same organization is looking to kind of roll that comment back. I think they would love to be able to delete that from the internet somehow. But the reality is that there is a power in being decentralized for long enough. Right. And being genuinely decentralized. And so I think the more decentralized a project can get over time, and that includes not having entities, I think the better off you'll be.
00:30:49.900 - 00:30:52.938, Speaker B: But it's not as clear cut for me as it was a year ago.
00:30:52.944 - 00:30:57.886, Speaker A: It's not a one size fits all and it'll have to be unique. I want to end on can I.
00:30:57.908 - 00:31:01.934, Speaker B: Get that disclaimer that was up here, just added there?
00:31:01.972 - 00:31:40.490, Speaker A: That not financial advice. I want to end on two questions, but that kind of concern different audiences or applicable different audiences. One is obviously this year has been interesting because, as most of us like to say, the tourists are gone, which is a good thing, but at the same time kind of affects where the things were finally ready for consumer adoption from a tech standpoint. But then nobody's here as a consumer wanted to come in. But at the same time, the people who really are passionate about this space are building and they're working on things that will define what the next few years look like. Do you have any advice for founders to think about what it means, like, to build in this type of environment?
00:31:41.150 - 00:32:39.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if you have a tourism economy and all the tourists leave, it's not amazing. So there's definitely downsides. But I would say that having no tourists means that you don't need to be operating and kind of maintaining systems in the same way. And there isn't the same level of pressure in terms of onboarding new people and all of the overheads that go along with having just a ton of new users pouring into a protocol. And so the opportunity really is to kind of take stock of what you built or what you are building and really go back to first principles and kind of question all the assumptions. And you can get away with doing really crazy stuff in a bear market, much more so than you can in a bull market. In a bull market, the optimal play is really just to kind of find whatever the narrative is and try and ride that wave as closely as possible and don't fall off in a bear market.
00:32:39.390 - 00:32:41.614, Speaker B: You can do weird stuff.
00:32:41.652 - 00:32:42.922, Speaker A: Well, you get to define those narratives.
00:32:42.986 - 00:33:10.630, Speaker B: Yeah, you get to define the narratives, but you also get to do strange things. So a really good example of that was synthetics back in March of 2019, deciding that we were going to go from 100 million fixed token supply to an inflationary token that now has 330,000,000 tokens. Trying to do that at a bull market. Yeah, exactly. It's three and a half times the number of tokens that we started with. Right. The original fixed supply token that we issued.
00:33:10.630 - 00:34:01.880, Speaker B: And when we went around and asked large token holders and other people in the ecosystem whether they thought that was a good idea or a bad idea, no one cared literally, it was like, sure, do whatever, we don't care. Right? And so when there's minimal attention on your project and when you're kind of thinking like, okay, what are some crazy experiments that we can run and see whether that helps us get traction or see whether that improves the flywheel or the incentive mechanism within the protocol, this is the time to do it and test and test and test and iterate and then hopefully with the small number of kind of, I guess, hardcore users you have, you can get enough data to find something that is workable so that when new users do start to arrive, you've really got the incentive structure as tight as possible.
00:34:02.970 - 00:34:23.242, Speaker A: You have a way bigger service area to experiment with so that one of these things work and you have more shots on gold versus the musical chair strategy, which you definitely don't want to risk on Live. My last question to you is, especially in this room, there's a lot of people who are coming from traditional finance. They were curious about how things are moving in this space, especially on DeFi.
00:34:23.306 - 00:34:24.750, Speaker B: I'm sorry for your loss.
00:34:25.730 - 00:34:45.670, Speaker A: So my question would be what comments or advice or sort of just general things you want to say to them, to people who are sort of still hesitant about playing with DeFi because all they hear about in the news is something going wrong or somebody getting screwed. What can we do to kind of help them be more comfortable or at least experiment in how they should think about this space altogether?
00:34:46.410 - 00:35:51.546, Speaker B: So I think the challenge is that a lot of the obvious things have already been done, right? And so if you're coming into the space now and you're like, okay, I've got some domain expertise in some particular area of TradFi and I think that that would be a useful thing for me to try and do. It can be difficult sometimes to find the gap in the market for like, we already have compound and Aave and whatever, right? We already have a bunch of DEXes, we already have a lot of things. And so the marginal improvement that I think you can make on some of these core protocols is maybe pretty small, but at the same time, we have absolutely not solved all the problems. There are definitely a ton of unsolved problems. And so finding that unsolved problem and working through maybe a more optimal solution is really the key thing in my mind. And that takes kind of a deep dive. You really need to get into the space and use everything and see there's nothing like kind of practical experience in that world.
00:35:51.568 - 00:35:52.810, Speaker A: Nuance matters a lot more.
00:35:52.880 - 00:36:57.490, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely right. If you kind of look at something like Ave and say, okay, the advantage you have is, yes, Ave is there. Right. And yes, Ave has a ton of market share, a ton of mind share, really good brand et cetera, but it is also a slow moving incumbent, right. In the same way that you have in TradFi, there's big banks that it's really hard for them to do stuff. It's really hard for Aave or even Synthetix to do something, right? And so if you turn up and you're like, okay, I see what this protocol is doing or what that protocol is doing, and I think that there is a potential improvement that could be made identifying that potential improvement and then finding a way to test that really rapidly will give you, I guess, the best opportunity of kind of differentiation. And if you do find something that is genuinely novel, like a genuinely novel solution to even a category that has a dominant incumbent, you can out iterate them and you can kind of improve things much faster than they can.
00:36:57.490 - 00:37:07.542, Speaker B: And again, in a bear market, the noise floor is much lower. And so there's only a few hundred people whose attention you need to get to be able to really start to get some mind share.
00:37:07.596 - 00:37:08.102, Speaker A: Probably less.
00:37:08.156 - 00:37:22.266, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe. They're probably all in this room. And so I think that it's a fine line, right? It's really hard because it's like you look at a dominant player like Abe and think, lending, let me do something else, right?
00:37:22.368 - 00:37:24.394, Speaker A: Somebody has won. What's the point?
00:37:24.432 - 00:37:53.834, Speaker B: Lending solved. And Uniswap would love you to believe that AMMS are solved, right? But don't believe the psyops. They're not solved. There's definitely some tweaks that could be made. If we believed uniswap, then there'd be no curve for right? So there's no question there are unsolved things and they might be more niche, but sometimes the niche use cases like Curve turn out to actually be huge markets. So that's what I would say. If you're coming from Tradfine, you've got some domain expertise.
00:37:53.834 - 00:38:03.682, Speaker B: Probably very few people in crypto have that domain expertise. And trying to find the place to iterate that gap to drive into is the right approach.
00:38:03.826 - 00:38:09.638, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for an amazing conversation. That was super insightful and hopefully everybody else also enjoyed it too.
00:38:09.724 - 00:38:10.338, Speaker B: My pleasure.
00:38:10.434 - 00:38:11.160, Speaker A: Thank you.
