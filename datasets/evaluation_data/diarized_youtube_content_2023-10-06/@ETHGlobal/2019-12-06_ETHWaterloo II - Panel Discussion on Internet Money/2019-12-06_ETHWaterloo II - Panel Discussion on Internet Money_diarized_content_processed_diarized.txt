00:00:04.550 - 00:00:05.100, Speaker A: Was.
00:00:08.830 - 00:00:26.230, Speaker B: Just form of housekeeping. If anybody's interested in the washroom, they're on the second floor. You can use the stairs in the back. So we have about 30 minutes for this.
00:00:31.320 - 00:01:08.020, Speaker A: Firstly. Hi, everyone. Thanks for having us. That's fantastic. Can we put a round of applause again for him? I think as a creator of all this, it so whipping through, I can make an introduction. Joey Crew, co founder of Auger, which is actually one of the first, ERC, 20 tokens on Ethereum. We've got Will Warren from Zerox, which is pretty much pioneering, like moving the needle on decentralized exchanges trading.
00:01:08.020 - 00:01:13.496, Speaker A: And then Marcelo from, I believe, your local homegrown hero, right?
00:01:13.678 - 00:01:14.650, Speaker C: That's right.
00:01:15.420 - 00:01:44.290, Speaker A: So, formerly in cash app and now the founder at sorry, what's a little so I thought there might have been a French tweak to the name. Guys, great to have you and thanks for being here. I wanted to start it off with you. What problems are you seeing that are appealing? What's decentralized finance appealing to you? What's making it appealing to you?
00:01:44.980 - 00:02:32.510, Speaker C: Well, I mean, especially I worked for four years at Square. They started building the cash app back in 2013. And I experienced all the pain of dealing with a very lack of systems of decentralized banking in the US specifically, but all over the world. And I don't really see a way for it to evolve to match what we need in 2020 advancements of technology that we have had. For me, it's really exciting to see what this bad is over here and just imagining what would be possible when this becomes mainstream. Really mainstream, that is.
00:02:34.580 - 00:02:39.490, Speaker A: Will, what do you think the biggest problem that you guys what does success look like for you guys?
00:02:40.360 - 00:03:25.052, Speaker D: Yeah. So, at Zero X, we have a mission to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. And for us, that means seeing that all forms of value end up tokenized on public blockchains that are globally accessible. So this could range from assets like Fiat, currencies, like gaming items, prediction markets, securities. And so we believe that if this value ends up tokenized on public blockchains, it'll democratize financial services in the same way the Internet democratize access to information. So that's what motivates is.
00:03:25.186 - 00:03:36.532, Speaker A: August, it's a long time coming. It's been very methodically built. Can you tell the audience a bit more about Auger? Because I feel like there's a lot of complexity to it and you'd be able to emphasize that really well, sure.
00:03:36.586 - 00:04:17.570, Speaker E: So, put simply, Auger is designed to be the world's most accessible no limit editing platform. And we built a lot of infrastructure surrounding that, a lot of stuff surrounding decentralized Oracles. But from the end user facing standpoint, that's really what it is. The idea is that similar to how Bitcoin enables them to do kind of global no limit transactions from point A to point B, variable fees, auger is trying to do the same thing but for any market it's basically political markets will trudeau and reelection the auger market that was actually bigger than the corresponding fair market. And then things like sports, finance, things like that.
00:04:18.420 - 00:05:14.112, Speaker A: So would it show a fans who used any decentralized finance products or DeFi products? Nice. Okay, so for those of you that don't know, banks typically are constructed of multiple products. Lending, borrowing, earnings, things like that. Now when products come to market like whether it's revolut or TransferWise or cash app, it's too difficult for them to do it all on their own. So what they do, they go to a bank that is going to permit it, they're going to white label all those services or they're going to aggregate and cherry pick vesta for each service. So it becomes sort of this s by 1000 papercard, so to speak. In that I feel like one of the most important things about open finance is collaboration and trying to focus and be an expert in the area that you've picked off, that you're responsible for.
00:05:14.112 - 00:05:21.732, Speaker A: Let us know how important is collaboration or is it more of a cooperation situation now?
00:05:21.786 - 00:05:45.070, Speaker C: Collaboration is definitely very one of the big reasons for us to create the cash app or one of the largest difficulties for us in the early days is in the US banks don't talk to each other, they don't collaborate. In Canada we have ways emails where we can send money to each other. It's not the greatest solution, but you can send money from one bank to another.
00:05:45.520 - 00:05:46.968, Speaker A: Is that interact?
00:05:47.144 - 00:06:28.274, Speaker C: Well, it's built on top of interact. But in the US before the cash app there is no way that you belong to a different bank. You can't send money to the other person without writing a check or doing something. Those systems are very old and legacy. They do these mainframes and it's not a thing that will change from day to night. That's why if you rethink how that works and crypto obvious is building all these protocols that makes all of this possible in the world of today. And you rethink all of that with collaboration, beauty things that will streamline the APIs for how these things should be done.
00:06:28.274 - 00:06:43.400, Speaker C: How do you talk to any other financial institution? The same rules applies to everybody only to have contacts within companies like other companies. In order to be able to use some of these technologies and make these things happen, the world in my opinion is going to be a much better.
00:06:46.330 - 00:07:03.280, Speaker A: So with the marketplace. Right? You've got let's say artisanal goods going into boutique stores and matches. So people that are looking to supply inventory, create inventory, would you ever see tokenization of those products onto something like zero X in the future?
00:07:05.250 - 00:07:06.660, Speaker C: That's a good question.
00:07:08.070 - 00:07:09.300, Speaker D: Definitely yes.
00:07:09.750 - 00:07:19.960, Speaker C: It's very hard to see the path from where we are today to getting to that. We have to go one step at a time. But that would be a much better place to be for sure.
00:07:20.410 - 00:07:52.190, Speaker A: And just on top of that, one of the things I think that's really interesting about when you look at marketplaces like that is predictions, future insurance and being able to create specific outcomes or at least forecast for them. Guys, generally speaking, how important is predictability to controlling risk in the market? And if risk is going to hinder adoption and the uptake of these products, do you think that that's going to be necessary?
00:07:54.450 - 00:07:55.200, Speaker C: Yes.
00:07:57.910 - 00:08:34.182, Speaker E: The thing on risk is there's probably a few big risks in the cryptocurrency space right now. One is like smart contract risk. So is the smart contract you're using actually secure? And that's actually really a hard risk price because the obvious thing is like, well let's make a smart contract bet on the smart contract risk. That doesn't really work because you're basically just creating a person solution. So you haven't really gotten rid of the risk and you also haven't really even hedged against the risk. That's a tough one. Getting better tooling to make it easier to write since yours smart contract, that sort of thing helps fix it.
00:08:34.182 - 00:08:59.400, Speaker E: And then you also just have systemic risks that are hard to think about. Like a good example of this is MakerDAO and the collateral backing it. That's like a really novel system that nothing quite exactly like it has really existed before. So how do you think about pricing risk in measuring kind of like default risk and CDPs and that sort of stuff? People have some answers but nobody really knows everything yet.
00:09:00.330 - 00:09:39.670, Speaker C: Even if you forget cryptocurrency, just think about for us as a marketplace, we just launched in Canada about five weeks ago. Just the fact now that we have to worry about the currency conversion from US to Canadian adds some instability or some uncertainty and risk just that is a big deal. Now you add all cryptocurrency risks and contracts and validation, top of something like that, that grows exponentially. But at the same time, if it's done properly and so on, it becomes eventually much better.
00:09:41.720 - 00:10:11.230, Speaker A: You guys are competing. DeFi is challenging the heavyweight champion in history, which is finance. It's got the deepest pockets. It's not going to roll over without any kind of fight. I feel like to me the way that I look at the space is that timing is everything. Timing is the difference between executing and not executing. Do you guys think that the window is finite for this opportunity to sort of dethrone traditional finance and move into open?
00:10:14.710 - 00:11:04.340, Speaker D: Good question. I think the biggest factor in the timing for DFI and adoption of DFI is really just is the technology there and it is, I feel like it is at least Ethereum 1.0 is giving us the tools we need to realize the potential of open finance. And it's amazing, the potential is insane. We still probably need a decade of RND just to scale up blockchains and to allow open finance to serve billions of people. But it feels like now is the time because the technology is starting to get there.
00:11:06.860 - 00:11:40.150, Speaker C: I would say it's definitely finite from the point of view that it's going to happen. Somebody's going to build the standard tools and everybody and a lot of people are working on it. Whoever is working on this now makes it be the standard, whatever they are, zero X or some other protocol or all the tools. It is the future. I have no doubt that it's going to happen. And the reason why it's financed, because somebody's going to create the standards, it's going to happen. So whoever's working, they have to make sure that they become the standard.
00:11:40.760 - 00:12:07.596, Speaker A: Yeah, there's sort of a fine line between standardizing things through collaboration and sort of aligning together and then also balancing that with systemic risk. And I know we were talking about risk before and so if we look at make it out hands up in the audience, anyone familiar with make it out nice. So make it hours for those on.
00:12:07.618 - 00:12:09.084, Speaker C: The screen that aren't familiar with it.
00:12:09.122 - 00:12:49.020, Speaker A: Or anything like that, make it hours responsible for creating Dai. Dai, which is this stablecoin. It's a decentralized stablecoin that is backed by, currently backed by Ethereum. And that means if you put your Ethereum down, you can draw down against that with a smart contract ensuring that you will make coal or be penalized otherwise. So MakerDAO is constructed of many different parts and finance is always markets. It's always going to be two sided lending. Borrowing is this shift from single collateral die into multicolateral die.
00:12:49.020 - 00:12:51.470, Speaker A: Does that keep anyone up at night?
00:12:55.920 - 00:13:54.108, Speaker E: I think it's interesting because they're basically going to be adding more and more collateral types and there's certain collateral types that it might actually be quite dangerous to add. And so I've seen people on Twitter, even people who work at Maker talking about, talking seriously about the concept of like, well, you could use a mortgage, use your home as collateral. And it's like people have forgotten the past decade. Remember 2008? There are problems with doing those sorts of things. And it's kind of a classic tale of like the clarity of hedge funds prior to 20 08 20 06 20 07 there are these Argentine farmland hedge funds and they had monthly and quarterly subscriptions and redemptions. And after eight the prices had collapsed and these hedge funds didn't end up paying back their investors until like 6789 years later. And so there's this concept of like liquidity is not necessarily always there.
00:13:54.108 - 00:14:17.512, Speaker E: And just because the market is liquid today doesn't mean that same market is going to be liquid tomorrow. And so I think that's something that is really under talked about in the community and should be taken a lot more seriously because just because we've had a ten year long bull market so far doesn't mean that we're going to have one the next decade. And in fact, I would actually bet on the opposite. I bet we have a bear market in the next few years.
00:14:17.646 - 00:14:23.768, Speaker A: What does a bear market do for DeFi in your traditional finance bear market?
00:14:23.934 - 00:14:57.030, Speaker E: I think it's good for DeFi because whenever people are dissatisfied with the traditional financial system, that's generally the thing that will lead more people, I think, to adopt DeFi. And we haven't really had that since Bitcoin was created during a financial bear market. And some argue it's possible to know, some argue that's kind of spark that led Satoshi to launch it. And if that happens again, well, it's bad for the average person, but I think it would lead to positive things for the adoption of this tech and then maybe next time around things can be better.
00:14:57.560 - 00:15:12.730, Speaker A: Just sort of like two steps back, five steps forward, sort of thing. Yeah. Just on top of that, who gets the most value out of DeFi? And do we target them today?
00:15:14.300 - 00:16:10.940, Speaker D: I mean, I think the people get the value out of DeFi are the end users of financial products that are just basically getting taken advantage of by oligopolies that can charge massive fees, that can nickel and dime them. And so, I mean, it's like asking who benefits from the internet democratizing access to information. It's like anyone that believes information and knowledge should be free benefits from it. If you want to prevent people from being knowledgeable and educated and informed, then it's not good for you. And I think if we were to use that same analogy, it's like, I know who DeFi is bad for and I don't really care that it's bad for them. It's like these oligopolies that have an entrenched interest in keeping things the way they are.
00:16:11.090 - 00:16:52.730, Speaker A: The heavyweights we talked about earlier. Yeah. What about accessing? The people that haven't even heard of financial products, do we get there? Do we get there in time? So the other side of the world, people that for an understanding, argentina, Egypt, wherever we are in the world that got really high inflation rates, they used a sort of 0% interest rate on their money. That's actually going to be a bonus because they're going to lose 14 or 15% over the course of the year through their current local currency. How do we get to them to really add tangible value as fast as possible, you think? And do we get there in time.
00:16:54.140 - 00:16:55.892, Speaker D: Specifically, like these countries?
00:16:56.036 - 00:17:11.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we've got the resources here to build really powerful products. How do we get sort of the infrastructure in the hands of those people that are going to capture the most value? They don't have Robin Hood cash app or any revolutions to choose from. How do we get it?
00:17:12.900 - 00:17:17.570, Speaker D: A decade plus of R D is scaling blockchain technology we need.
00:17:20.020 - 00:17:20.528, Speaker A: Today.
00:17:20.614 - 00:18:19.030, Speaker D: Like we're probably going to see traction in blockchains for basically like toy use cases like Chris Dixon talks about, the most impactful products and technologies usually start out looking like toys. I imagine that's kind of what is going to happen with blockchain technology and DeFi is that we're going to serve these use cases that are kind of appealing to people that are educated and informed and understand the promise of the technology. And that is going to allow us to continue scaling the technology and improving it and eventually reach mass adoption. But we're not going to be able to get there immediately. I think that would be pretty challenging. Unless you're like Libra, if you're Facebook and you have billions of users, you can skip the toy phase directly to mass adoption. But there are obviously some serious trade offs around that as well.
00:18:20.600 - 00:19:16.216, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say, again, very naive view of this is that if you look at the Cash App or all these other apps that are on Robinhood, and there are many others that are starting to provide access to stocks and investments that weren't available to the masses, to everybody, and there's a lot of traction. What can be built on top of cryptocurrency and all the new technology that's coming is that anybody in the world is going to need to have access to it. I don't know what's needed to get there. You're going in that direction. An app like the Cash App has a very hard time in today's world getting out of the United States. We've been trying to bring it to Canada for forever, since I was like we worked on it here in Canada, in Kitchener, actually. And it's very hard to work on a product that you cannot actually use it day by day.
00:19:16.216 - 00:19:28.612, Speaker C: The reason for that is banks, traditional banks, and how hard they make it for financial institutions to do whatever they need to do because it's all centralized control over.
00:19:28.766 - 00:19:36.300, Speaker A: And is that the regulators breathing down the bank's neck or is that the banks breathing down the regulator's neck?
00:19:39.300 - 00:20:26.732, Speaker C: First of all, every bank is different. There isn't like a common protocol that you talk between all of them. You go to a different country, you're going to have to negotiate contracts with each institution there and then implement all of their protocols. It becomes a massive nightmare to go anywhere else. For a company like Square in general, it's very hard to expand to the country for those reasons. Now, if banking was completely decentralized and anybody could build something, you build an application like the Cash App on top of a decentralized network, and from day zero, it's available to everybody on the board. So it's a matter of time for again, this thing needs to become mainstream first.
00:20:26.732 - 00:20:34.816, Speaker C: But right away, as soon as it's mainstream in the US. Anywhere else, it's available to everybody in the world, which is a huge yeah.
00:20:34.838 - 00:21:04.410, Speaker A: I think that's actually interesting. So recently, Cash App, they brought in sort of stocks into the app. And I've always thought that one of the really most exciting things when I look at Zero X is the idea to sort of provide a trade market, or like a very open market where everyone can kind of build a Robin Hood out of the box almost with people supplying these tokens and Zerox providing the conversation between traders. How do you think about that, Will?
00:21:04.860 - 00:21:53.130, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, that would be amazing. So it might not be like serving the entire global population, but I still think the fact that people in many parts of the world can't access publicly traded Canadian companies or US. Companies, and oftentimes these big companies that are the best and most attractive investments, it's people that it's immigrants that are building these companies and running them and their family can't even own the shares. It's ridiculous. I think creating tokenizing, things like stocks and stuff like that, and opening it up to a global population, it is actually like a really impactful use case.
00:21:53.500 - 00:22:14.690, Speaker C: Yeah, I love that and I can't wait for that to be a reality as well. Yes, from a public company point of view, for sure. I have family back. I'm from Brazil originally. I have family, their friends, they cannot buy stuff. Socialized companies, even if they would want to, they can. It's a very hard process.
00:22:14.690 - 00:22:45.080, Speaker C: Now that would be really cool even for private companies. When you look at how hard it is to even run a round of investments and how much money we spend on lawyers, and how much work it takes to basically sell shares of your company to a few investors. I can't wait for a world where it's all, again, decentralized and tokenized and smart contracts and anybody can do it without all this overhead.
00:22:45.500 - 00:22:56.830, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of people think about who's used Robinhood or who trades stocks in one of these sort of digital bank looking apps. Robinhood revolver, whatever. Great.
00:22:59.520 - 00:23:00.670, Speaker C: Another from.
00:23:03.300 - 00:23:22.900, Speaker A: One. Simple trade wealth. Simple trade. Great. Okay, so and other people on the stream out there as well. What's really interesting to think about it is I don't know how many people okay, so people using Wellsimple Trade, how many of you have got stocks in Apple? Yep. Okay, cool.
00:23:22.900 - 00:24:23.970, Speaker A: How many of you went to a shareholder meeting? Sure. Okay, so one person. So if you think about that, what's really interesting is there's a big conversation about regulation and regulatory guidance and how do you collateralize ownership of the stock? The purpose is it doesn't matter, really. The fact is people aren't flying to go, hey, Tim Cook, I've got a problem with the Q three earnings report released about iPad sales in Southeast Asia. People are going to get exposure. And I think that conversation is really interesting to me. When I look at zero x do you guys think about that? Do you factor that into execution as well? So giving this sort of idea of everyone can have a stock exposed, like exposure to a stock versus how do we play towards the regulation to adopt sort of the alternative, which is owning the underlying stock certificate.
00:24:27.750 - 00:25:17.490, Speaker D: There's definitely two different paths and they're both viable. So creating compliant tokenized securities and playing by the rules is like it might be slower, but it could be better for the ecosystem in the long run. I don't know. I imagine just shareholders in some ways can be like a community and or they can be users. So if you're a user of a product and you want to own a stake in that company that develops it like that, that could be appealing. I don't know how things end up if it's compliant tokenized securities or if it's prediction markets for synthetic Apple stock.
00:25:18.470 - 00:25:43.610, Speaker E: Yeah, I think one thing is about on this kind of like global use case of people wanting to buy assets that they can't get access to. It's a really tough market to get into because one is the UX for this stuff hasn't improved enough yet. That's like one prerequisite. Second is like tech and scalability, as Will already mentioned. And then three is like you're selling a product that hasn't existed. So it's blue ocean. It's hard to pitch a product where people don't have a conception of it.
00:25:43.610 - 00:26:28.230, Speaker E: It's like one example is this company in two companies in China. One's called Butu and the other one's called Tiger Bros. One of them was actually started by George Soro's old partner in the these companies. Each of them are worth about combined, they're worth about 2 billion, $2 billion, which is actually small when you think of how large the China market is and how large the potential market is for Chinese nationals who want to buy Apple stock or Tesla stock or whatever. So that shows that they have Chinese partners who are really well connected and that shows how hard it is to sell these types of products. But I do think it could happen eventually as awareness is built. And I think synthetic assets are an interesting approach because you don't have to deal with the underlying asset.
00:26:28.230 - 00:26:52.370, Speaker E: You don't have to deal with what happens if the underlying asset gets frozen or something. And most people today aren't buying stocks for the dividends anyway. And also most people aren't putting shareholder meetings either. So if you just want exposure, the synthetic version actually could be like a cheaper, more efficient market on blockchain kickstarter than actually dealing with the real physical stock.
00:26:53.430 - 00:27:09.080, Speaker A: Do you see that going into the private funds thinking? Joey's, also the CIO of Pantera Capital, which is one of the first Bitcoin funds, sort of really early mover in the space. Do you see that creeping into that space as well?
00:27:10.970 - 00:28:11.500, Speaker E: Not as much, just because that market hasn't really tokenized private funds, mostly because there aren't really liquid venues to trade them yet. And then also, if you're a good private fund, you don't need to raise capital from retail investors. And so there's kind of like this mismatch where the products that do exist aren't actually the highest quality products. I think the regulations surrounding this were like ten times easier and it was super easy to do from logistical standpoint. Then it might take off and you see this with larger investment banks going more and more retail. You could envision eventually that investment managers would eventually go more and more retail too, like in the 90s. If you ask somebody, do you think Goldman is going to launch a retail focused bank? They would have said heck no but here we are goldman has done just that and so you could eventually envision the same thing happening for institutional Asset managers too but it's going to be a very long road and not something that I forecast anytime soon.
00:28:13.910 - 00:28:39.690, Speaker A: What'S changed the most over this year? Your opinion at the start of the year to now what was the most surprising thing? We're at November already this feels like it's just going like in crypto for all of you guys what do you think is the biggest surprise moment for the year so far? I don't know honestly that was surprising. That's my answer.
00:28:40.140 - 00:28:46.730, Speaker C: I'm not really following everything closely there's so much happening I would love to know the answer.
00:28:49.040 - 00:29:42.430, Speaker E: I'm surprised that the progress on Scalability solutions has progressed as well as it has. I was relatively bullish on it at the beginning of the year, but it was one of those things where I was only like 30%. Confident in it. And at this point, I think there's a ton of scalability solutions that are actually written up. Software exists, they're being tested on test networks, things like that. And as much of them that intend to ship over the next six months whether that's things like blocks, route DK roll ups, optimistic roll ups, plasma variants and a half dozen other things and so I'm super excited for the scalability landscape because I think by the end of next year it'll be possible to have relatively high throughput transactions and that would be relatively feasible, I think.
00:29:44.850 - 00:30:28.030, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I agree. Actually. Probably the most surprising thing over the last year has been the pace of development in zero knowledge proofs and that entire area of technology because these concepts have existed for like 30 years. People have been working on this stuff and there are people that are building scalable side chains and stuff and they're running on testnet ethereum like today, which is pretty insane.
00:30:32.290 - 00:30:33.840, Speaker A: Any audience questions?
00:30:37.970 - 00:30:40.706, Speaker E: Hi there I have two related questions.
00:30:40.888 - 00:31:10.326, Speaker F: The first is a major criticism of DeFi is regulatory and that banks and traditional systems are forced to obey these rules that are pushed down by lawmeters but DeFi sort of got prepassed and we're able to iterate on that so how would you respond to that? Do you think we're bypassing the system by not working with these regulators or being able to iterate fast because we're taking additional risk. And on the topic of risk, my question is what do you see as.
00:31:10.428 - 00:31:11.466, Speaker C: Or who do you see is being.
00:31:11.488 - 00:31:16.294, Speaker F: Responsible for when things go wrong? Someone gets fished, someone lose their private key? Do you see this as a user risk?
00:31:16.342 - 00:31:17.374, Speaker E: Like your sol.
00:31:17.492 - 00:31:22.800, Speaker F: Do you see this as being a platform risk? And if so, how do you do that without centralizing layer two?
00:31:24.850 - 00:32:34.390, Speaker D: Yeah, good question. So regulator, I think the question of is DeFi going around the system and kind of breaking rules and moving fast. So is the question is that happening or should it happen? Should it happen? I think it depends on your view of the system you're bypassing. So sometimes the systems that end up kind of forming, they make sense when the system is formed. But today, as technology progresses, the regulations and the kind of lane that has been put in front of us doesn't really make sense anymore. And so you can either work with regulators to convince them that it should change or you can just burn it down or you can just go right through it and sometimes you just need to do that, honestly, in my opinion. But there are also very good regulations.
00:32:34.390 - 00:33:44.410, Speaker D: I think the ICO Craze really demonstrated why investor protections exist and stuff like that. So it's definitely not an easy answer, but I think regulators acknowledge that and regulators will say like, yeah, laws are important, regulations are important, but we also don't want to get in the way of innovation. At least in the US. Some of the regulators have that position when it comes to whose fault is it if a user gets hacked or they lose their private key. The philosophy behind cryptocurrency in general is like, don't trust, verify, take kind of personal responsibility. The power behind cryptocurrency is the fact that you can take ownership of your own assets and you don't have to rely on anyone else. So I feel like it's important that we keep that philosophy of personal responsibility and self custody.
00:33:47.580 - 00:33:49.320, Speaker B: Other questions from the audience.
00:34:00.070 - 00:34:04.574, Speaker A: My question is for august question is ty.
00:34:04.632 - 00:34:06.182, Speaker C: I listened to an episode on Face.
00:34:06.236 - 00:34:15.790, Speaker A: Layer podcast about Vale built on top of auger, but curious to know what.
00:34:15.860 - 00:34:16.480, Speaker C: Your.
00:34:33.190 - 00:35:10.846, Speaker E: Yes, I think Mail is super interesting. I think they ended up kind of like pivoting and making a port of auger, which didn't quite make a lot of sense to me because I think it was like some of the benefits, it was kind of like the worst of both worlds. Like got the negatives of centralized prediction markets and the negatives decentralized. So you didn't have a huge product differentiator there. So I think to me, like decentralized prediction markets, the most important things are that they remain global. So globally accessible at base protocol layer, no limits on transactions. The idea is that if you're.
00:35:10.846 - 00:35:32.738, Speaker E: A winning better or a good trader, you shouldn't be limited because of that. In traditional betting markets, it's the opposite. You get limited pretty much everywhere. If you start winning, you're betting $1,000 into the match, it'll get cut down to 100 next week, maybe it's $10. I see people who started with limits at 100,000, they get down to a dollar 50. That's a big problem. And then last piece is fees.
00:35:32.738 - 00:36:07.354, Speaker E: Fees aren't that important, but they're a good piece. You look at like betfair traders on Betfair who are in the top 1% traders, they're charged 20% fees. In some cases, you can get charged up to 40% of your winning here in the top 1%. Now that sounds like well, that's a small population, but in reality those people are driving 60% to 70% fan fair volumes. So it's actually big piece of it by volume. That's kind of how I think about the market as far as people building on top of things like Auger. It kind of relates to his question over there as far as where's responsibility wise.
00:36:07.354 - 00:36:31.610, Speaker E: I think if you're building something on top of Auger, you might say, hey, we'll take a little responsibility. If something goes wrong, will they be paying back for it? But in exchange for that, we're going to charge a fee on top of the base protocol. So you can have systems like that where you can add value for those certain things you can do in a centralized way that still brings through the benefits of the decentralized layer. So to me, those benefits are no limits and globally accessible.
00:36:35.660 - 00:36:38.170, Speaker B: Time for one last question. If there is.
00:36:43.160 - 00:36:44.230, Speaker C: Do you have a.
00:36:45.720 - 00:38:19.392, Speaker D: Question from the group? Do you have a situation which situation in which major governments start releasing their own cryptocurrency? What do you think the impact will be on things like ethereum? Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, it could be a Bad Thing for the Cryptocurrency Space in general, people that Might be interested in the Technology because it's their only alternative to government currency, and Then they really realize the benefits of decentralization and like a non government alternative. Maybe we don't get as many of those people coming into the space because they're satisfied with a government issued digital currency. But yeah, government issued digital currencies could be like a pretty scary pretty scary, in my opinion. It allows governments to have a complete kind of view into everything everyone is doing with their money. And having financial privacy, I think is something that everyone appreciates, whether you don't have to be doing bad things to want to keep your spending habits and net worth private. So I don't know.
00:38:19.392 - 00:38:23.280, Speaker D: I think it's like kind of a scary trend.
00:38:25.620 - 00:39:05.710, Speaker A: I'm just going to answer this one as well. I think it's really scary as well, but I actually think that this is the biggest layup we could get as an ecosystem. If you think about the difficulty of convincing, educating and onboarding someone who's only got paper notes in their wallet versus someone that's a cash app and trying to get them to move from cash app into, let's say, make it out or something like that. The friction point, I'd say it's a globally crowdsourced onboarding procedure, so thanks for the 3 billion users kind of thing. Yeah.
00:39:07.480 - 00:39:20.010, Speaker C: I think it would go against the decentralized property of cryptocurrency. It would be validation, for sure, but it wouldn't work. So it would be good and not work for the government.
00:39:23.440 - 00:39:43.970, Speaker D: If we're going to have a government issued digital currency, if the government can have transparency into the citizen spending habits and finances, hopefully citizens will have much, much more transparency to government spending habits. So maybe that could be a good outcome of it.
00:39:46.270 - 00:40:12.258, Speaker B: All right. Well, Joey, Will, Marcelo. Michael, thank you very much. And next up, we have Peter Kieltica. If you could, come on up to the stage. Peter is going to be leading an introduction to Web Three. And Peter was the co founder and CTO of New Layer.
00:40:12.258 - 00:40:21.330, Speaker B: He was also the co founder and CTO Prescott, but today he's the co founder and CEO of Horizon Blockchain Gaming.
00:40:21.490 - 00:40:22.210, Speaker D: Welcome, Peter.
