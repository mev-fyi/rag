00:00:06.730 - 00:00:27.190, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. Depending on where you're calling from, we have Eulis here from AP Wine doing a workshop on your first future yield strategy. If you have any questions, they can go into the Zoom Chat and EULAs will be more than happy to answer them. And with that being said, I will pass the mic off to our speaker.
00:00:27.850 - 00:01:04.980, Speaker B: All right, thank you very much, Anna. Hi, everyone. Nice to see so many people here. My name is Yulis. I'm one of the founders of, you know, to get the gist of it, we're a platform, a DeFi platform for tokenizing, future yield and getting your interest in DeFi in advance. So let's see together how this works. We're going to be introducing APY first, and then we're going to be building a strategy together about how to get your interest in advance over an entire three month, six month, one year.
00:01:04.980 - 00:02:00.420, Speaker B: All right, so APY is building derivatives on yield. This is how we introduce ourselves. This is a quick introduction about the protocol itself. The reason we did this in the first place was because in the DFI summer of 2020, if some of you have witnessed it, there was extremely volatile yield with a lot of risk and so a big exposure to volatility on all these APYs annual percentage yield. So we just came up with the idea, what if it was possible to get your interest ahead of time and at a fixed rate? And this is how we came up with the idea. The idea of yield tokenization is a primitive that we've introduced in DeFi that allows you to buy, sell and hedge your future yield. Now, how does it work? Very simply, you get your interest bearing assets or whatever.
00:02:00.420 - 00:02:44.110, Speaker B: If you're using wiren, you can use Wi Fi stake, Wi Fi interest bearing assets such as Adai on Ave, aUSDC and so on. So this is a token that generates yield over time. You deposit that on APY and you get two different tokens. And this is the yield tokenization. You get one principal token, which is the initial value of your deposit, and then your future yield token, which is worth zero at the beginning, but is going to contain all the yield generated by your deposit. So at the beginning of the period, three months, six months, whatever, it's worth $0. And at the end of the period, it's worth exactly whatever was generated.
00:02:44.110 - 00:03:24.240, Speaker B: So once you get these two tokens, you can already imagine how to build strategies on top of that. And to get your salary in advance, your yield in advance, you effectively need to sell your future yield token on our exchange. So mint PT and FYT with IBT and then burn. You can withdraw at any time. You're never really locked on APY. Now, I'm not going to go through the AP one AMM too much in detail, but it's basically we've built this in house kind of like uniswap balancer and so on. It allows you to trade your PT, IBT and FYT together.
00:03:24.240 - 00:04:07.660, Speaker B: So you can either buy PT at a discount, for example, this is basically a fixed rate, but not advanced rate. And if you buy FYT, you get more exposed to the volatility. If you sell FYT, you get less exposure. So you get your yield in advance and at a fixed rate. There's a lot of some of them I've already mentioned, but the PT trading buy PT at a discount, wait till the expiry of the period and get your yield at a fixed rate. Another fun one is the yield section. So basically, sell your yield in advance and then reinvest it to sell it.
00:04:07.660 - 00:04:56.442, Speaker B: As long as it's profitable, you can do this kind of loop. There are other strategies that I'm not going to go through today, but we're going to be building our own little strategy, fixed rate selling, future yield. So leverage the yield tokenization of APY APY AMM to secure fixed rates on your yield. Now, in order to kind of follow along, you're going to need node JS and yarn. So there's probably we can share the slides on the discord after that. So you can kind of follow along if you want to after that. But you're going to need the repository that I'm going to GitHub.com
00:04:56.442 - 00:05:29.800, Speaker B: eulodev apwarnworkshop. So let's do this first step. Now, I'm going to clone this and we're going to be navigating through it, opening it in Visual Studio. All right. And I hope this is visible enough, the size and everything. So let's go to sorry, this is not the right folder. If you want workshop and then code.
00:05:29.800 - 00:05:58.590, Speaker B: So here we are. First thing you want to do is install the dependencies of the node modules. So just yarn, simple. You just install everything. This is the setup of the repository. And then you're going to want to go to the written to kind of get an overview of what this is. And you're going to want to copy this environment file to a local amp file.
00:05:58.590 - 00:06:30.890, Speaker B: The private key that I've shown here is just an example private key. So it's linked to a random account to test out. And the Alchemy API key is I think it was abused before because it's a public repository. So I think it's disabled now. But we're going to go I'm just going to, for the sake of this workshop, go through another key. Okay, now that everything is set up, you can just start your node. So we're going to be running a local ethereum node.
00:06:30.890 - 00:07:04.318, Speaker B: So this is very simple. Just yarn, start node. And there you have it. And next you want to open another terminal and just go, you know, yarn step one, yarn step two to follow along this workshop. Just like that. So yarn step one. And boom, you get the first step, which are all going to be in the script.
00:07:04.318 - 00:07:35.760, Speaker B: And then step one, step two, step three, step four and step five. Let me see. Yeah. App is inactive. So let me just quickly sorry about that. Let me just quickly go through Alchemy and get the new API key. All right, we're going to be 1 second.
00:07:35.760 - 00:08:27.320, Speaker B: We're going to be getting another API key because this one is not working. All right, thank you for waiting. Here we are. Just copy paste this and then we're good to go. We can just go through the step one again. All right, just give me a minute to fix this. Not sure what's going on.
00:08:27.320 - 00:08:52.534, Speaker B: Yarn, step one. Let's go. Okay, we're good to go. Thanks. Now, as I've said before, the first step that we're going to be going through, and let me just put back the parama here. The first step is going to be the SDK creation. So for this, you're going to want to import the API and SDK.
00:08:52.534 - 00:09:23.190, Speaker B: And it's going to be just a very simple SDK is equal to new API and SDK. And here you want to pass your provider, your signer and your network. By the way, we're going to be using TypeScript for this workshop. It's pretty simple to use. So you can just follow along here and you can see here that we're initializing the SDK with our provider signer and network on mainnet. And if you run the command like I just did, you can see that it shows. Okay.
00:09:23.190 - 00:09:59.854, Speaker B: We've initialized the SDK. Now the second step is the world is now open to you, the world of APY. And so you can just start getting all the information about the products that we have, about the futures and so the assets that are available in the platform. So if you want to get a list of all the assets on APY, you can just go through future vaults is equal to SDK, fetch all future vaults. And this is what we'll be doing here. So step two. Now we go to the other file and then we just do futures is equal to fetch future aggregate from address disfetch.
00:09:59.854 - 00:10:33.040, Speaker B: A little bit more detail. So a little bit more complete. And I just want to take this opportunity to point out that we are using an old block number for this workshop so that it's kind of reliable every time I do it. So you can find here that. So which block is it? Reset fork. So this is the block number that we will be using. So this is a little bit in the past.
00:10:33.040 - 00:11:23.266, Speaker B: All right, so now let's run the step two, and we're going to see what assets are available on the platform and how we can use it. So it's fetching all the ten future vaults that were available at the time. Now we have almost 30 future vaults on both polygon main net and coming to Arbitrum very soon. Right, so it's fetching takes a little bit of time to fetch everything. By the way, we're running a fork here. So this is our local node that we've kind of pinpoint to a specific block number and this allows us to do a local fork of Mainnet. So now this is done, we can see that we have Xsdt from Stakedao, we have State ETH from Lido and so on.
00:11:23.266 - 00:12:04.550, Speaker B: So this is all again in the past, which is why you see past dates, but these expire in three months and so on. So now for the step three. Now that we have all the assets and all the addresses of the futures, what we want to do is get the basic Apr for specific assets. And for this workshop we will be using the Stake ETH strategy. So let's do this. We are going to get the spot price on the AMM. To do this, you just need to run SDK, fetch spot price and then you specify the vault that you've just fetched and then the from address and the two address the from and the two are actually two tokens that you want to swap between on our AMM.
00:12:04.550 - 00:12:41.604, Speaker B: So here what we want to do is, for example, from underlying which is going to be ETH to PT, which is going to be locked ETH for the entire period. And this is how you can get a fixed rate on APY. So let's do yarn step three. All right, now it's computing the Apr. And by the way, all the data that we fetched before is cached, so it allows you to be a little bit faster in the future runs. And so now we compute the Ptapr. The Ptapr for staked ETH.
00:12:41.604 - 00:13:18.320, Speaker B: So for ETH basically is 35% at the time where I created the workshop. So it's really nice and there was a lot of opportunities at the time and there still are in the platform. I encourage you to go check it out for yourself. 35% is very good. Again, this is a fixed rate. So now is this efficient? Can we be more efficient with this? So lower our liquidity needed to get a better or same result? And in fact, yes. And we're going to go through how to do this in this today's strategy.
00:13:18.320 - 00:13:54.640, Speaker B: So, today's strategy is not just buying PT with underlying but really going through the FYT route. So tokenizing our st ETH into PT and FYT and then selling the FYT for PT to maximize our fixed rate. And to do this, we just want to go through a few steps. So imagine you have your ETH as a beginning, as an underlying asset. You want to first deposit on Lido Finance, so get your state ETH and then deposit on APY to get the PT plus FYT. So this is what we will be doing. We're going to be tokenizing in this step.
00:13:54.640 - 00:14:36.668, Speaker B: And to do this, we're going to check how we do it. So first step is going to be depositing onto lido finance. So we start with some wrap ETH and we just deposit our amount to tokenize, which is ten ETH onto Lido. And to do this, I've just set up a very simple utility method. If you check it, it just sends ETH to the ste address. This is how you deposit on lido once we have our state ETH. So at this stage, we can then tokenize our SDE by depositing it on APY.
00:14:36.668 - 00:15:08.164, Speaker B: And to do this, you just want to SDK future vault and you just call the deposit method on the SDK. So here we are. You can also select to automatically run an approval transaction. So this just prevents you from writing two lines instead of once. It's kind of a utility method that we've put in the SDK. So let's run this and see how it goes. So again, two very simple steps.
00:15:08.164 - 00:15:41.284, Speaker B: Deposit on lido and deposit on APY. And if we do this, we deposit ten ETH on lido and then we deposit all everything that we have on AP one again and we get 9.93 PT and 9.93 FYT. And before you call me a scammer, and why did you get less PT and FYT than you've put ETH? This is just a regular function of the protocol. Basically, since the period has already started, you're getting an FYT that already has some value. So if you withdraw your 9.93
00:15:41.284 - 00:16:00.104, Speaker B: PT and 9.93 FYT you're going to get your ten state ETH back. Exactly. But since the FYT has some value, of course it needs to be accounted for. Nice. So now what we want to do as the last step is swap all of our FYT. So the 9.93
00:16:00.104 - 00:16:29.270, Speaker B: to our PT. And again, when you buy PT with anything even underlying or FYT or whatever, you basically get a fixed rate. So here we're going to be maximizing our fixed rate. This is the fifth step. So to swap on the SDK, it's very simple SDK swap. In, you pass the AMM object which is going to be the address of the AMM. And then you pass very simple strings from FYT to PT and the amount.
00:16:29.270 - 00:17:13.264, Speaker B: And what this is going to do is automatically route through the PT. So the FYT swap to PT and then PT to ETH. Of course, if you want to swap from FYT to ETH, this routing is kind of similar to what you have on Paraswap or 1inchh or any kind of dex aggregator where you can do the automatic writing. But we have this on APY. So now let's see what is the result and how we can analyze it. See what's the purpose of doing all this. If you go to this fifth step, you can see here that we're just getting the AMM address of our staked ETH future.
00:17:13.264 - 00:18:19.284, Speaker B: So the future that we used before to tokenize, we're now getting the associated AMM address and then we just swap in FYT to PT and the result that we get is ten point 36 PT, which in a sense is a 36% rate, sorry, a 3.6% rate. This is because you just did a profit over your ten initial ETH, so you're getting 36 profit. This is a fixed rate again, and if you look at the annualized Apr, you are getting 34.38%, which is very close to what we had in the previous step. Now, what is the purpose of doing all this? This is all to say that AP One is very efficient, but this specific strategy is even more efficient in the way that it supports much better capital efficiency. So you can have trades that are up to ten times as big as the previous step that we did before.
00:18:19.284 - 00:18:56.844, Speaker B: So something like 100K will very likely go through on APY. You can try as much as $1 million going through this strategy to get a fixed rate on a bigger capital. Right? And this is basically how you get a fixed rate in the most efficient way on APY. Now it is your turn, of course, hackers, to kind of hack around the protocol, see how it can be integrated with other platforms as well, or just other fixed rate protocols. You never know. So, yeah, it's your turn. Creative strategies get rewarded.
00:18:56.844 - 00:19:41.260, Speaker B: We have a few prizes up for grabs, whether it be arbitrage, leveraged yield or trading bots. We're very happy to see what you come up with. And as a last thank you for listening to this workshop, I just want to mention also that we are hiring. So if after the workshop and the hackathon, you've enjoyed working with AP Wine, working with our team, asking questions. If you're interested in joining the future of fixed rates and yield, we are hiring, so please reach out. If you have any questions or if you want to get in touch, the email is here, contact at apyne phi. The telegram is at apyne finance.
00:19:41.260 - 00:19:55.460, Speaker B: Please again reach out, join the group and we can chat together. Thank you very much for listening to this workshop. I'll pass it back to Anna. And thank you again for listening. Happy hacking.
00:19:56.280 - 00:20:00.444, Speaker A: Awesome. I think you actually have a question in the Zoom chat.
00:20:00.592 - 00:20:02.410, Speaker B: Yes, please do, please do.
00:20:03.420 - 00:20:07.880, Speaker A: So, what is the correlation between the APY of PT to ETH?
00:20:08.460 - 00:20:09.930, Speaker B: Oh, sorry, what's that?
00:20:11.180 - 00:20:16.380, Speaker A: What is the correlation between the APY of PT to ETH?
00:20:17.120 - 00:21:07.404, Speaker B: What is the correlation between the APY of PT to ETH? So I'm not sure I understand fully the question, but okay, you have an APY on ETH, on Lido Finance. So right now it's shown, for example, around 5%, last I checked. So this 5% is what you're getting on a variable rate, right? On APY, of course, this is the beginning of the platform and this is why there are many opportunities. But in the long term, the APY on APY is going to very closely match that of Lido Finance. It's just logical. Now, the relationship to this APY shown on Lid of Finance and the APY shown on APY as the PT fixed rate is that you're getting this one not as a variable rate, but as a fixed rate. You're simply buying PT with your ETH in order to fix your rate.
00:21:07.404 - 00:21:42.540, Speaker B: This is basically how it works. And logically, you're going to have a discount. So if you're getting 5% on Libo Finance, you're going to get something like 4.5% on APY as a fixed rate. So there's always going to be some kind of discount. I hope this made things a little bit clearer, but please ask away if there's any other points to clear up. Thank you.
00:21:44.030 - 00:21:52.350, Speaker A: Yeah, it looks like cleared up. Thanks for the answer. And then UC asks, what are the competitive advantages of APY over Sense Finance?
00:21:52.770 - 00:22:32.374, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I feel like I'm doing this question over and over every time I speak, but I think it would be nice for you to join the group, kind of learn more about APY. We have a docs at Docs APY phi. Basically, we made our own AMM in house. We launched the V one one year ago. And, yeah, I feel like there's an entire competitive space in the fixed rate and advanced yield platforms. So there will be a lot to discuss on these aspects, but please reach out to kind of get your own opinion on how Aqine is different from Element Sense Pendle.
00:22:32.374 - 00:23:01.614, Speaker B: There are so many to talk about, but it's very good. Thanks for the question. Can you customize strategies and interact with rotor or wrapper contracts? Yes, of course. You can do whatever you like. You can even go through the contract yourself. The SDK is basically a wrapper for the contracts. But if you feel like techie enough for this hackathon, you can just dive into the Solidity and build your own very custom strategies.
00:23:01.614 - 00:23:33.086, Speaker B: This is more made the SDK is more made for off chain computation. But if you want to make an on chain strategy, you better go with Solidity directly. And you can also do new integrations with other protocols in that way. Again, every time I kind of reply, please, if there's anything unclear, please let me know. I'm just going to go through the next question. So Danny is asking if one PT is equal to one ETH. And Danny, I think you got it right.
00:23:33.086 - 00:24:17.294, Speaker B: You understood the protocol very well. So at the beginning of the period, one ETH is not going to be equal to one PT. This is because there's going to be a time discount. So let's say if you have $1 right now and $1 in one year, of course it's not worth the same amount in terms of value because you have more potential investing that one dollars right now into something else. Now, at the end of the period, one PT is always equal to one ETH. And this is how the protocol works. So if you just take this very simple fact, you can buy PT at a discount at the beginning of the period, because it's cheaper, and then wait till the end of the period till one PT is equal to exactly one eight, and this is how you can secure the fixed rate.
00:24:17.294 - 00:24:23.630, Speaker B: This is the entire idea behind it. Thanks for the question.
00:24:26.000 - 00:25:09.308, Speaker A: Awesome. I think that's all the questions we have. Now, if anyone has any more questions, you have a couple of seconds to send in the Zoom chat. Or you can even come off live or sorry, ask your questions live, but otherwise, I guess that's everything. Well, thank you so much, Elis, for taking the time to do this workshop for the ETH Online hackathon and to the hackers. As Elis said, if you have any questions, they can be reached out over email, their telegram, or even in the ETH Online event Discord in the sponsor AP Wine Discord Channel. They are going to be available all month.
00:25:09.308 - 00:25:21.516, Speaker A: So super excited to see what everyone's going to be building. And once again, thank you for everyone for joining. And that being said, I hope everyone has a great rest of your awesome.
00:25:21.618 - 00:25:34.164, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much for joining, everyone. Yeah, thank you, Anna, for inviting me. And please reach out for any ideas, help on anything. We're here. You know we're here for you. Thank you so much.
00:25:34.164 - 00:25:35.328, Speaker B: Happy hacking.
00:25:35.504 - 00:25:37.600, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Bye.
