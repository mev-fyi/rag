00:00:18.930 - 00:00:24.710, Speaker A: Okay, we can start. I'll restart the stream and we can go so you can start the program.
00:00:24.860 - 00:00:52.770, Speaker B: Okay, sounds good. Hey, everyone. Welcome to our last workshop of the day at Day Two workshop at Buildquest. Hope you're all having a nice evening, morning, afternoon, depending on where you are. We have Lei and Leibing from Covalent doing their workshop on Biddling the Metaverse with one unified API. Questions can go in the Zoom chat. And with that being said, I'll hand the mic off to our two workshop hosts.
00:00:53.830 - 00:01:00.494, Speaker C: Thank you. Hi, I'm Lei, product marketing at Covalent. Leiping, you want to say hi to I'm Leiping.
00:01:00.542 - 00:01:04.040, Speaker A: I'm from Devreau at Covalent. Nice to meet you.
00:01:04.970 - 00:01:33.300, Speaker C: Yeah, so we'll get into it. I think Anna mentioned if you have questions throughout, you can put them in the chat since there's two of us and one person can probably answer. But we can also get to questions at the end and probably won't be too long. I think we have, like, 30 minutes today. So welcome, everyone. And I also apologize if I stopped for water or I coughed a little bit. I might have got sick at East Denver, so still kind of recovering, but yeah, let's go ahead.
00:01:33.300 - 00:02:18.320, Speaker C: So today we're talking about building the Metaverse with one unified API. Really excited about the theme of this hackathon. Yeah, it's really interesting to see different hackathon topics pop up and things that are geared towards really creative outputs. So I'm looking forward to seeing what everybody's able to actually build. So what we're going to cover today is some Web Three data trends and challenges. A little bit about the covalent API. If this is your first time coming across us, or if you already know Covalent, but you just want an overview of hackathon resources and everything like that, how to access NFT data, since one of our bounties, if you make use of our NFT endpoints, you can get rewarded there.
00:02:18.320 - 00:03:02.574, Speaker C: And then some resources and project demos. And this is kind of the fun part that we'll go through and show you how to actually use the API in the browser. And then some examples of things that you can build as well, which I think is really useful for Inspo. And we also have use case like templates that we build out at Covalent. So if you want to fork those and build upon them, it makes it really easy and quick to get started too. So just like an overview. As we all kind of know, it's been a really big year for everything crypto and everything Web Three, and we've seen quite a lot of adoption, especially from 2020 to 2021, and now in 2022 as well.
00:03:02.574 - 00:04:14.210, Speaker C: I mean, things are going down a little bit, but for the most part, we can definitely see that adoption is happening. But we like to plot this kind of curve that you'll see on the right of other types of historical technology and how long it kind of took to reach mainstream adoption, just to give some context of where we kind of are. And adoption for crypto, it's still low. And what that means is even though we're seeing big brands that we recognize and more web two companies coming into the space and putting their hats in the ring, we still have a long way to go in terms of the infrastructure and the maturity of this space and building solutions at things like hackathons. And what we're doing right now, it's still like the forefront of innovation and we're paving the way for more people to basically participate in web3. So one of the things we actually recently released that kind of ties into the theme of this hackathon is a real upswing in GameFi. So I would really recommend if you're interested, sorry, if you're interested in GameFi and trends of play to earn gaming and kind of the movement that's happening there, I know that ties into the current kind of hackathon as well.
00:04:14.210 - 00:05:10.454, Speaker C: I would check out some of the figures on our website. You can find an ebook that was recently released, but just to share some of the statistics that we're seeing, there's millions of people or millions of active wallets that are participating in GameFi currently. So it's a really big opportunity and it's exciting to see what solutions could be built around this data, basically, and the fact that there isn't really a good solution right now to access all of it. And it's something that we're working on is providing more GameFi data. So we indexed Ronin, which is like the axie side chain, and we're working on providing more data in the gaming space because basically what happens when we see these big booms and trends and this is what ties back to those data trends and challenges, is that there's a lot of noise. And I'm sure if you're on crypto Twitter, you can see that it's hard to know which are reputable sources. It's hard to know which figures are being taken from where.
00:05:10.454 - 00:06:10.198, Speaker C: And blockchain data in and of itself is kind of messy and hard to extract. So yeah, these are all challenges that we're kind of focused on solving at Covalent. And hopefully if you have an interest in building with us in the data side, you're also one of those people that would like to make sure that the data that you're getting is accurate, reliable, and that you're building solutions that aren't like, misleading anybody as well. So one of the things we like to think about that kind of ties back to where we are in terms of the adoption curve is just what the next couple of years are going to look like in crypto. And it helps at Covalent for us to do this because we're building an API that should be reflecting data across all of the different blockchains that we want to index and that's a lot to do because we picture the future being very multi chain and we can already see that that's happened. We started by indexing like Ethereum Finance and kind of the big ones. And now we're even moving into non EVM chains like Salana and we currently index 28 different blockchains.
00:06:10.198 - 00:07:07.430, Speaker C: And we want to continue to do even more of that because basically we see millions and actually, I think, billions of data points on the blockchain. And this is not just for financial purposes, this is for anything that's on the blockchain data around, one, your transactions, but also just like supply chain information and art and a bunch of different use cases. And we believe that all of these applications that are moving towards blockchain as a decentralization and Web Three becomes more popular are what is really going to power the lives of potentially billions of people. So what that means again, is those applications need to be robust. And that also means that the data needs to be interoperable between different chains because we're not really living in a world where people are just interacting on Ethereum anymore. Most people I think, that are participants in Web Three have different wallets. They go across chains.
00:07:07.430 - 00:07:54.166, Speaker C: Bridging technology is really difficult and challenging and data just it's hard to move from place to place and it's hard to build applications that can scale really easily too. And that's something that we want to make easier. And that's part of why we kind of developed Covalent and where it fits in. The crypto stack is basically just to provide a really clean, standardized form of data where we can verify that the format that you'll be getting is the same across the different chains that you want to pull it for. And if you want to add a new chain, it's as simple as changing a parameter versus running more nodes and building out another transformation engine. So that kind of leads me to what the Covalent API is. Maybe some of you are familiar, maybe this is the very first time, but Covalent provides a unified API.
00:07:54.166 - 00:08:38.082, Speaker C: So it's one API that you can query from the cloud, it's no code. And basically our main kind of feature is that well one, it's free, so that's good. But two, you can enable MultiChain capabilities for any of your builds just by changing a parameter which is called the chain ID. So this is really useful. Again, if you are focused on more interoperable and scaling solutions, you can just loop in different blockchains to whatever you're building. And also each time we index a new chain, that exposes you to another ecosystem as well. So just to kind of go over the crypto stack and where we sort of fit, there's basically the blockchain layer which is where we're interacting and writing to the blockchain and then there's nodes.
00:08:38.082 - 00:09:15.378, Speaker C: And that's the method of extracting the data from the blockchain. So if you're a developer and you're not using covalent or if you're using different solutions, you might be running your own nodes. But this is an experience that is kind of a barrier for a lot of people, especially just hobbyists or analysts or emerging kind of demographics that might want to find their own data and make use cases for that. They're not really going to be running their own nodes. So where we fit in is more of like supporting the scaling of applications by being a data layer. So we take care of the entire data extraction process. We host all of the blockchain data in a database.
00:09:15.378 - 00:09:56.894, Speaker C: It's an ELT framework. So then that means like extract, load, transform. So anyone developing with the API is only focused on the transformation step, which is actually just developing those applications. So we're really just focused on enabling the front end use cases. And that can be things like dashboards, analytics, applications, art galleries, NFT galleries, wallets, taxation tools, really any on chain data that you would need. There's a bunch of possibilities and things that we might not know yet. So, again, that's kind of why I'm excited about a metaphors hackathon, because I don't think we've seen that many use cases outside of in that realm.
00:09:56.894 - 00:10:49.010, Speaker C: Like, we see a lot of wallets, of course, and things like that. But I'm excited to see kind of more creative ways to use blockchain data. And yeah, that is how we kind of envision by making it more easy to build applications, we think we can support a lot more users faster and basically ensure that we reach adoption in this space, which benefits everybody. So, yeah, our two major user demographics are obviously developers, blockchain developers, and people building applications. But we created an analyst mode in our docs, which you'll see later when we demo some of the resources. We're seeing a lot more analysts that are wanting to make quick insights using the API and fetch their own data and have that reliability. So you can actually download all of the API responses in a spreadsheet format, which can be really useful for not just analysts, but also anybody that wants to do sort of like analytics.
00:10:49.010 - 00:11:27.134, Speaker C: There's no need to reinvent the wheel because Excel is probably not going anywhere ever. So, yeah, we're just making it easier for those use cases there as well. And here's just a couple of our customers. Currently we have over 15,000 developers and 500 plus projects building with us. And it's a little bit hard to track these things because it's free to sign up. But these are just some of the big names that we work with. And these people use us to display things like their balances, which is our number one endpoint, and also NFT galleries, as I mentioned, any sort of metadata there that is needed, and taxation tools, things like that.
00:11:27.134 - 00:12:00.042, Speaker C: So we'll go on to our bounties oops things not working. There we go. Okay, I have to backtrack. Here we go. So we're offering two different bounties or two pools basically, for this hackathon. You can both for each of them, there's a $2,000 USDT prize pool. So the first one is to make a GameFi analytics dashboard, and the second one is for any meaningful use of the Covalent API for a build quest build.
00:12:00.042 - 00:12:18.960, Speaker C: So a meaningful use is just basically something that is like you're trying to solve a real problem, present a real solution. Creativity we evaluate and the complexity of endpoints and things like that. And I think I'll hand it off to late Bing here. We can talk a little bit about more about the bounties and then show you some of the resources and stuff.
00:12:20.950 - 00:13:50.280, Speaker A: Thank you, Lei. Let me just share my screen. All right? Maybe I'll talk a little bit more about the bounties first. So as you can probably find more bounty information on the ETH Global price pool page, right? I'm sure many of you have already seen it, so I wouldn't navigate to the page. But just to give a bit more info about GameFi analytics dashboard. Right, we saw GameFi Ballooning first of all, but then there's a problem, which is that we just keep receiving a lot of marketing information about who's earned how much within these play. To earn games, there's not necessarily much visibility about the on chain data, right? So by building the GameFi analytics dashboard of your favorite web3 games, you can allow analysts, investors, or GameFly players to answer certain questions, such as what is the reach of this game? What's the retention of this game? How much revenue are people earning on this? Sorry, having a bit of a cough on this P to E game.
00:13:50.280 - 00:14:40.410, Speaker A: Right? And all these can be done using our covalent endpoints, what the games are. Normally, there are some smart contracts within, let's say, Ethereum blockchain within polygon blockchain. Many of them are very popular on polygon chain and also whichever chain that they're on. And this is our covalent API documentation. As you can see, you just need to get like a API key and you can call a lot of these information in browser. I've already signed in and have an API key, so I just run a custom request for you. You want to find the most basic one, right? You want to find the token balancers of your own Ethereum address.
00:14:40.410 - 00:15:36.220, Speaker A: You click run here and bam, here you go. This is the address with querying in question. And these are your tokens. Every single one is stored as an array within this items field of this response object. Okay? So this is what you'll be receiving as a developer. If you're a non dev, there's also this analyst mode which returns you your balances in CSV format, and you can download it in CSV, Excel or Sheets in the context of GameFi on chain contract activity. What you're looking out for? Sorry, what you're looking out for typically tends to be well, you want to see the token balances, the amount of money stored on contract.
00:15:36.220 - 00:16:20.184, Speaker A: You want to check out maybe the number of ERC 20 token transfers. And then you might want to search by lock events of the contract. This is one that is useful. What it does is that within if you're familiar with blockchain development or on chain data, right, you know that a lot of the data points are stored within these locked events emitted by the contract. Like each contract would have, let's say a transfer log event. Let's say you are within the game. You're transferring an item between player A and player B and that is locked into the contract as a transfer log event.
00:16:20.184 - 00:17:06.900, Speaker A: What this endpoint allows you to do is to get all the log events within a smart contract. Of course, the applications are endless. It's not just for within the context of gamepipe, but it allows you to pull every single activity on chain from the contract as log event. And what you do in the front end is you do some further filtering to get the specific item that you need. Let's try to run one with the custom example here. I'll run it in developer mode. As you can see, the response data is a bit more complex.
00:17:06.900 - 00:18:08.580, Speaker A: But when you take a look at it, the information you're looking for is typically just thought somewhere here. This is the contract in question. So I'm just going to have a drink of water. This is the contract in question. And if you can see right, the name of the contract is the compound Governor Alpha contract. And when you decode the contract, this is the method that is called it is a vote cast, right? And you can see this is the signature. And this signature is essentially the log event signature on etherscan.
00:18:08.580 - 00:18:46.544, Speaker A: Like for instance, let's look at a random contract. Like let's say ENS token contract. For instance, a contract here. Wait, where's the log events page? This is the token. This is the contract. Okay, you can see the events here. There we go.
00:18:46.544 - 00:19:30.940, Speaker A: Each of these events are emitted by the contract and they have a signature, right? And this signature is being captured here. Every single event signature and each of these data points. The address of the voter is here with this value proposal ID for the vote cast 42. This support field boolean. True. Okay, so that is one log event. The second log event emitted is another vote cast event, similar structure, et cetera.
00:19:30.940 - 00:20:04.210, Speaker A: The third log event VoteCast. Again. I mean, this contract is all about voting. So all the events emitted from here is about votes. Maybe we can even try finding like a GameFi. Let's try searching for XE infinity. Is it this one? Okay, I don't have one here at the moment, but you can definitely give it a go.
00:20:04.210 - 00:21:25.226, Speaker A: You can even run your custom request here, right? You have a gaming smart contract. You put it here, you specify starting and ending block just to narrow the responses given because sometimes the number of events can be huge and you want to be able to receive a response. And yeah, you can do that. And you can also get events by log, events by topic, hash if you change the chain, you can get multi chain kind of queries, right? These are the chains that we support. And that's it for this bounty. The second bounty, we're not restricting you in any way as long as you use the Covalent API in any kind of build. You can use it in a DeFi dashboard, you can use it in a wallet, you can use it in transparency dashboard, you can use in portfolio trackers, you can build your own OpenSea, you can build your own Zapper really quickly without using subgraphs or without writing complex queries.
00:21:25.226 - 00:22:26.782, Speaker A: All you need to do is just explore the data a little bit. So that is the hackathon resources that we have for you. What you saw just now was the API reference, right? We have a further Covalent docs which gives you more support, tutorials, how to guides, as well as further kind of tools that we have up here to tailor the response that you want to get. One of it is called Primer. Okay? What it does is that it primes the JSON response on the server side such that you return a different kind of response object that's tailored to your needs. And to do that, you just need to alter the query string. All right, that's all we have for you on our end order.
00:22:26.782 - 00:22:36.760, Speaker A: Best with your build quest builds, and let us know if you have any questions. Right now we'll be answering questions.
00:22:39.690 - 00:23:28.006, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw somebody ask in the chat just about whether or not we support ERC, 721 and 1155 in the balances responses to. And we do, just so everybody knows. So, yeah, enjoy checking that out, as Leiping mentioned on the docs site. So not just our API reference, but the Covalent docs, the second resource there. You can also see a past list of some projects from other hackathons to get inspiration if you ever want to take a look through project showcase on there. And that can be really helpful for just like having a starting point if you're looking for ideas or things to build. And you can also check out our Covalent REPL, which I think is linked probably somewhere on the prize page, but if it's not, I can link it.
00:23:28.006 - 00:23:46.490, Speaker C: And that's where you can find those quick use case templates that you can get started with. So just in case you want to make it even easier to kind of check out how to build things right away and you don't want to waste any time. I will link that in the chat.
00:23:48.110 - 00:23:50.780, Speaker A: Yes, there.
00:23:55.670 - 00:24:00.420, Speaker B: If anyone else has questions, feel free to come off mute and ask it live as well.
00:24:16.600 - 00:24:18.900, Speaker C: Everyone's just, like, heads down hacking.
00:24:20.700 - 00:24:29.690, Speaker A: Yeah, because we are one of the last few workshops today. Right. All of them must be in the middle of something at this point. Probably.
00:24:31.500 - 00:24:46.130, Speaker C: Looking forward to seeing everybody build and really will take on the GameFi dashboard as well, just because that's, like, a newer use case that we haven't seen much of. So it's an opportunity to do something pretty cool and innovative and yeah, I'd love to see those.
00:24:48.580 - 00:25:02.724, Speaker B: All right, if there's no other questions or I guess I have a question. Leon Lee Bing, what would be the best way for hackers to reach you or the Covalent team? If they have any questions, please go.
00:25:02.762 - 00:25:18.570, Speaker A: Onto the ETH Global Discord Channel under the Sponsor Covalent Channel under Buildquest. So we'll be answering all your questions there.
00:25:20.300 - 00:25:31.420, Speaker C: Yeah, and you can also join the Covalent Discord too, if you have hacked with us at other events and stuff or if you want to stay more involved with our community. You can ask for questions in there too, anytime.
00:25:33.520 - 00:25:55.056, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. And thank you, Lane Leaving, for taking the time out of your weekend to do this really awesome workshop for hackers. Yeah. Really excited to see what's going to be built from Buildquest. And with that being said, I hope everyone has a great rest of your weekend and see you soon.
00:25:55.238 - 00:25:57.040, Speaker A: Thanks NFO having us.
00:25:57.190 - 00:25:59.750, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for everyone coming out too. And to a year. Yeah.
