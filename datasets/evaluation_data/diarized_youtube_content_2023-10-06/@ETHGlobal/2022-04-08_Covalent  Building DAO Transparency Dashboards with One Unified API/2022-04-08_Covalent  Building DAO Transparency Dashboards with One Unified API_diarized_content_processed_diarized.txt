00:00:00.090 - 00:00:25.310, Speaker A: Everyone. This is our last workshop of Dow hacks, our last sponsor workshop of Dao hacks. And we're excited to have Leibing here from Covalent, who's going to be doing workshop on building Dao transparency dashboards with one unified API. So, questions if you have any go in the zoom chat and Leibing will be more than happy to answer them. And with that being said, I will pass the mic over to Leibing.
00:00:26.490 - 00:00:54.798, Speaker B: Hi, guys. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us at this final sponsor workshop of the day. I hope you guys are having fun hacking away. I'm living from Covalent. I'm from the developer relations team here at Covalent. And unfortunately, Leilani wouldn't be joining us today because she's on a holiday, so I'm very envious of her.
00:00:54.798 - 00:01:43.470, Speaker B: But it'll be just me today and we'll have fun here while she has fun somewhere else. Okay, guys, let me go ahead with the presentation. We're going to cover four things today. Some of the data trends in web. Three what is Covalent API and how you can use our API to access Dow on chain data or any other kinds of on chain data that you want to build. So the bounty that we have for this hackathon for Y'all would not just be limited to DAOs, it is a very open bounty. You can work on DeFi, you can work on NFTs, you can work on other kinds of dashboards.
00:01:43.470 - 00:02:59.420, Speaker B: Hold on, my alarm is off suddenly. Just give me 1 second. Sorry guys, I am back. So, yeah, you can use us for all kinds of onchain data and then I'll just give you a quick run through of the resources as well as demos that you can use for the hackathon. So, as you know, within the last two years, crypto adoption is on the upswing, right? We saw Fintech and Crypto merging, a lot of big players suddenly entering into the game. We saw brands like Crypto.com blowing up and booking stadiums and changing the name of stadiums to their brand, and we saw government initiatives all over the world, right? And in terms of kind of the history adoption of this technology, we're still pretty much at its infancy.
00:02:59.420 - 00:04:02.450, Speaker B: We at Covilla believe that by 2025, there will be millions of critical information on public blockchains. There will be dozens of single or multi use blockchains that will power thousands of DFS, just like how we are using thousands of web two applications in our lives right now. And more than 1 billion users will be on chain. And we're very close to this kind of vision already. Now, there's a problem with that vision because each blockchain is this contained ecosystem which does not necessarily talk to each other. And as we have seen in the last few months, bridge technology can inherently be rather insecure. It is still pretty much in its infancy as well.
00:04:02.450 - 00:05:20.330, Speaker B: Blockchains produce lots of data, but these data is not as neat as our traditional relational databases, like in SQL, right? They are often very disorganized because of the decentralized nature. There's no standard data structure. It is pretty complex to understand and also very difficult to store. So there's a huge data problem in terms of accessibility within blockchains as well. So what is the covalent API? Right. We are a Data API service where we expose neatly packaged blockchain data from all 26 27 chains that we index into a standardized query format. Right? So for instance, if you want to get the token balancers of someone in the ethereum chain, it will be the same query that you use as the query that you use to get token balances from Avalonche chain, for instance, you just need to change one chain ID, and I'll show you that later.
00:05:20.330 - 00:06:19.020, Speaker B: You can query it from all kinds of environments. You can query it from your terminal using code, you can query it from the browser, you can query it from your code, front end code or back end code, because that's what APIs are. We make the data public for you, so you don't necessarily need to code to be able to access the data. We have the ability to export the data in CSV or Google Sheets format as well for you. And all this allow you to get multi chain data across lots of the major chains, right? Within a couple of minutes, even seconds, if you know how to set it up. It's really simple. Okay, so we make the data of blockchains easily accessible and transparent.
00:06:19.020 - 00:07:11.182, Speaker B: Where do we fit into your crypto stack, you may ask? Right, because blockchains themselves produce the data, and the data is hosted in nodes which are typically exposed as JSON RPC. Endpoints. We are not the proprietor of this data, by no means. Right. What we do is that we aggregate the data from all the different nodes so that you don't have to make individual queries to each of the nodes to get the data that you want. And that's typically very useful if you want to build multi chain applications. We see ourselves as the data layer where we, like I said, aggregate the data, package it into formats that fit easily into different kinds of use cases.
00:07:11.182 - 00:08:34.790, Speaker B: For instance, if you want to build a wallet, if you want to build an NFT gallery, if you want to build any kind of analytics and charts or any sheets, all you need is just a couple of endpoints to power your applications. So some of our users include analysts, data analysts, research analysts, and also crypto developers. And our API service is being used by a lot of developers and projects in the ecosystem. And here is the exciting part. What bounties do we have for you guys for this hackathon? For Dow hacks, we are offering a 4000 USDT price pool for projects that makes meaningful use of the Covalent API to build any Web three project, including Dow Dashboards, including if you even want to build Dow Tool or any form of community tool for Dows, that's possible. If you want to build an NFT tool or NFT idea, that's possible as well. A d five idea.
00:08:34.790 - 00:09:04.316, Speaker B: We kept this bounty open up to you guys to build any kind of web3 startup idea that you want if you need on chain data to get it done. Coville fits into the back end. I didn't change the amount here. Let me just quickly change the amount so that it wouldn't be misleading. 4000. There we go. Yes.
00:09:04.316 - 00:10:20.630, Speaker B: So what does price pool mean? Price pool means that let's say we have 20 projects submitting to the price pool, right? We will be splitting the price pool up evenly across 20 projects after taking into consideration the different tiers of merit. So that's the other thing, because often we receive projects that some projects put in a lot of work, some projects maybe put in less work. And some projects are really solid ideas, and some projects we can't really understand the use case, et cetera. Right? You can find more bounty write up in the price page that ETH Global has for you. And because of that, we often give different peers of merit. So, for instance, some projects will receive $300, some will receive $400. It wouldn't be too drastic, but there will be a differentiation because we feel it is only fair if the projects that are more deserving gets awarded a little bit more, right? So there's a price pool that we have.
00:10:20.630 - 00:10:50.996, Speaker B: All right, let me just go through the hackathon resources that you guys can use. The first one, obviously, would be our API reference. And this is the most important one here on number two. Here in other places it's called documentation, but here it's called API reference. So let me just click through and share with you what this looks like. There you go. Classic documentation.
00:10:50.996 - 00:11:27.012, Speaker B: On the product that we offer, we have two kinds of endpoints that exposes different kinds of data for your. The first one is class A endpoints. The second one is class B endpoints, right? Class A endpoints are on chain data that you can find across all chains. For instance, this is a list of chains that we support, right? Ethereum. Polygon avalanche. BSc. Moonbeam.
00:11:27.012 - 00:12:06.084, Speaker B: Phantom. And you can find this kinds of data across all of these chains. For instance, there are data specific to balances. You want to get the balances of my address on RSK, you can use this. If you want to get my balances on Ethereum or polygon, you can use this as well. What does this look like? Get token balances for address. This is a query string, right? And you can often run it to take a look what the sample response will look like.
00:12:06.084 - 00:12:45.220, Speaker B: And when you run it, we give a sample demo address for you to run and see what it looks like. So this is your response. This is the product, this is the data response that you get that will be integrated into your code, right? And let's take a look at what the response looks like for balances. We queried this sample address that was provided in this example. And this person has lots of tokens. Actually, he has 125 tokens, different tokens. And we are querying the Ethereum Mainet.
00:12:45.220 - 00:13:54.820, Speaker B: So what kind of tokens does he hold? He has a Kygy.org token, which is the ERC 20 token. And this the balances that he currently hold for that token. Why is this number so big? Because it is denominated in Way as these data go in blockchain, even if you use web3 PY, right? The other service that allows you to access on chain data through nodes, it will also be denominated in weight. So what you need to do often, if you want to get it in Si unit, you take this number divided by ten to the power of the contract decimal. All right, let me repeat that again. If you want to get in Si unit, for instance in ETH or any other, this one in Ky Dy token, in its original unit, you take the balances divided by ten to the power of contract decimal.
00:13:54.820 - 00:14:59.292, Speaker B: You can find that information, more of those information in, I believe this part when you view responses here, balance the asset balance. Use contract Sml to scale this balance for display purposes. All right? Okay. So that is this endpoint. And you can also get the historical value over time. So why is this very helpful? If you want to chart what are my trading patterns for anybody, what are my trading patterns? What is the trading pattern of this trader? Right? You can use this one to get what are his historical holdings over a period of time of 30 days. Can get all the token transfers for a particular address, right? And you can see the list of balances endpoints here.
00:14:59.292 - 00:15:51.660, Speaker B: It's very helpful for building any kind of DF and I'll show you some examples later. You can get NFT data, right? Can get the NFT tokens IDs for one particular NFT collection. You can get a global market view. And this is a new endpoint that's really powerful. It allows you to, at one glance get the market cap of every single NFT collection within an ecosystem. Let me let you have a look. Now, if you click run here, it will return you the market cap of every single collection within these NFT marketplaces on Ethereum Mainet.
00:15:51.660 - 00:16:24.754, Speaker B: Bam. There we go. The top NFT market cap and it is sorted according to market cap is wearable and this is its market cap in way. Then we have a very popular collection called Townstar apparently nowadays, and Fantasy Island Sandbox. And I'll show you what it looks like on the front end when it is all displayed. Right. So we've got NFT data, we've got transaction data.
00:16:24.754 - 00:17:08.410, Speaker B: And this category we've got base. So what Base refers to is a couple of foundational data that you can get, for instance, get block heights within a certain date range. You provide the start date and end date. For instance, I want to find how many blocks are being produced on the Ethereum chain today. Maybe there's no easy way for you to find that. Right? How are you going to query that? So if you click Run, you'll be able to see that I don't know which dates they use. For this example, you can click Open tab here, which will open you to the actual request itself, and it's quite useful.
00:17:08.410 - 00:18:34.358, Speaker B: So they use the date, the first day of this year, 1 January to third gen. And these are the blocks that are being produced on Ethereum chain, and there are a total of 13,000 blocks. Okay, so really useful stuff as well. You can get log events of any contract address that will allow you to get the more granular data of every single kind of log events. If you're familiar with this, that's emitted from the Smart contract. All right? And class B endpoints are protocol specific endpoints, for instance, Uniswap. Uniswap is available on a couple of chains, right? And this allows you to get the number of pools in Uniswap, the addresses exchange balance, right? And XY equals to K endpoints lets you get the Dex pools, for instance, of any kind of uniswap cloth or any fox of uniswap.
00:18:34.358 - 00:19:39.920, Speaker B: For instance, on Ethereum Mainet, you can use XY equals to K endpoints on SushiSwap SushiSwap Quickswap on Polygon, you can use this endpoint on Spirit swap on Fandom. Right? So all these are very popular DEXes whose data might not be easily visible or transparent, but with this XY equals to K endpoint, you can get access to what's really going on, how many people are doing what kinds of swaps, of which kind of liquidity pairs. That's the most popular in these endpoints. So, yes, all these are currently available as class B endpoints. All right, now, okay, before I end this, let me just give you some quick ideas of what else you can build. What else people have built in particular dow Tooling systems. Right.
00:19:39.920 - 00:20:49.430, Speaker B: So this is a dashboard that was built at the previous hackathon. It is a Dow transparency dashboard. So if you go to the stop, it won the price for the hackathon that we participated. So the problem statement that we set for that hackathon was there's lots of Dows out there, right. But there's very few ways that people can gain insight into what happens behind Dows, how big is their treasury, how many proposals they put up. Yeah, so the idea of a Dao is all transparent and decentralized, but really, how decentralized or transparent is it? Right? What is their token holdings of the members of the Dao? So we want to see how people can use the covalent API to build a Dao transparency dashboard. And let's take a look at it in action.
00:20:49.430 - 00:21:18.214, Speaker B: Let's say we want to analyze this dow called Bitdao. There we go. It computes a transparency score. This score is computed using all these on chain data that is provided from Covalent API. For instance, the Dow Treasury, the amount in this treasury is 2.1 billion. This dow holds 2.1
00:21:18.214 - 00:22:26.000, Speaker B: billion of on chain money, right? They have a token which is Bit token and this is its token price. All this can be gotten from COVID API as well. And if you are familiar with DAOs and Snapshot platform, snapshot is a proposals platform for DAOs to be able to get proposals through with their community, right? And this is their followers. I don't think this is provided with our API though. So the rest is so if you take a look at it, the Get Historical Portfolio value endpoint is used to generate this chart that gives you the Dow Treasury over month, which is used to calculate how much the treasury changed over the last month. It also gives you this top bit token holders. We have this endpoint, right? Get token holders, if you remember, Get token holders as of any block height, right.
00:22:26.000 - 00:23:34.830, Speaker B: Using that endpoint, we can see that this is the top bit token holders and you can do that for any coin. And then when you calculate it against the total circulating supply of bid, you can see that this address holds 30% of bid, right? It's a whale in terms of the token holders of this. And then this other address holds 20%. And so on, 11%, 9%. And then there are all these smaller fishes, what I like to call them, that also hold this token and that's gotten using the Get token holders endpoint. And yeah, what are the other tokens that is being held on chain in this treasury? These are the tokens and that's gotten using our Get token balances endpoint. Okay, so all this information is being used to do a calculation and produce a transparency score.
00:23:34.830 - 00:24:30.190, Speaker B: Let's take a look at another one, maybe radical. Yeah. So a smaller treasury here, a smaller transparency score, less decentralized. This top address holds 51% of the token for this dow and these are the currencies that it holds, mainly concentrated on USDC and ETH. All right, so this interesting example of a project that you can use to build for DAOs. I'm running a little bit out of time, so I will be sorry. I think I opened that meeting and hurt myself through the YouTube, which scared me a little bit.
00:24:30.190 - 00:25:03.652, Speaker B: I'll be opening this up to Q A. All the best with your projects. And if you go on the Bounty page, you can find more information on resources. Okay, I've got one question here in the chat. How does Covalent compare with Graph or Morales? Great question. The graph uses GraphQL to do its queries. We are quite a fundamentally different architecture.
00:25:03.652 - 00:25:54.852, Speaker B: I believe you can think about it this way. The data that we get is like casting a net, a huge net into the sea, right, to get lots of data. If you saw an example of a response, it holds lots of information and with one query you basically can power a page of your application. Whereas for the graph you get very specific granular data. It's like phishing in some ways you get very specific data. So it really depends on your use case, right? We do not need you to write subgraphs that differs for every single on chain platform. You can simply for instance, you want to get token balances.
00:25:54.852 - 00:27:19.890, Speaker B: All you need to do is change the chain ID to get different token balances of different chains and that allows you to onboard and build DApps really fast, right? I would say as a dev, try out all your options and compare and see which is the use case that is really suitable for your app. What are the rate limits like for covalent beyond a certain number of API calls do you have to pay? So our product is entirely free for you to use. We currently have a rate limit of five requests per second. So that actually means you get to call around more than 10,000 requests or 20,000 requests a day, I think, which is currently pretty sufficient because of the kind of data that we have. One page of the application only requires one call most of the time or two calls. And currently we do not offer a paid tier. Everything is free for you to use and try.
00:27:19.890 - 00:29:00.286, Speaker B: And we are thinking maybe in the future of implementing a paid tier where you have a higher rate limit. But so far we don't have that service for you. How do I convert this data to meaningful UI? On React? A sample tutorial on UI integration? Yes, we do have this one on Replit NFT market cap. So let me just share this on NFT. Let me just drop this in a comment here. So this is an example of a page that's built in React. And if you see here, how do you integrate it into the front end? You call Axios, right? Typically this is what you'll be doing axios get and our API request string and then you get the data which will come in response and then you get the data you want.
00:29:00.286 - 00:30:03.134, Speaker B: It will be stored. You need to analyze a little bit the data structure to pull out the data specific data that you want and then you slice and dice it to fit whatever you need. And what this looks like is this page. All right, you'll be able to find using the NFT market cap data, this very useful information on the top performing NFT collections of a chain. Like for instance, this is polygon chain and we have the top performing one which is zhorse with a market cap of 46 million, and then crypto unicorns, abagotchi, chicken derby, et cetera. What's very useful about this is that we also have the average price for the 24 hours, right? And the total number of transactions that ever occurred on this collection, and the number of wallets that currently contains Zhorse or crypto unicorns. Crypto unicorns sit in 3000 wallets, for instance.
00:30:03.134 - 00:30:35.040, Speaker B: And when you click through, you get to see the price floor, another super relevant and hard to get data point. Just give it a SEC for it to load. And there we go. We see the price floor for the last 30 days. You can change the granularity here, but as you can see, it's currently going down a little bit, right? And this is what the unicorns look like. I don't even get hatched yet. Yeah.
00:30:35.040 - 00:31:13.550, Speaker B: So is there any more questions? I think I'm three minutes past my time. Anyone else? No worries. Awesome. Yeah. If not, yeah. I want to thank all of you for coming, and I can't wait to see what exciting projects you guys will be building using our API. And all the best and have fun for Daohex.
00:31:14.690 - 00:31:23.278, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much, Leiving, for hosting this workshop. I believe it's really early in the morning for you right now, so thank you.
00:31:23.444 - 00:31:28.438, Speaker B: Yeah, no worries. I'm kind of used to it. And thank you so much, Anna, for having me.
00:31:28.564 - 00:31:42.520, Speaker A: Of course. And as being said, feel free to contact the discord if you have any questions throughout the rest of this weekend. With that being said, I hope the rest of you all have a great rest of your Friday or Saturday, depending on where you are.
00:31:43.610 - 00:31:44.360, Speaker B: Yes.
00:31:44.730 - 00:31:45.282, Speaker A: Bye.
00:31:45.346 - 00:31:49.860, Speaker B: All right, guys, you can find me on discord in the channels. Take care.
