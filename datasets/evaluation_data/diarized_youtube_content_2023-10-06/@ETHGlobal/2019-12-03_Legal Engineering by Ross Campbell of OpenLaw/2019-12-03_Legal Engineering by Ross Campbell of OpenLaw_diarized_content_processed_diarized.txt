00:00:08.970 - 00:00:44.722, Speaker A: Campbell I am a legal engineer with OpenLaw, which is a company that's trying to build a template library that plugs into Ethereum. There's been a lot of questions. I'm often asked, what is legal engineering? So I thought this talk was as good as any opportunity to start discussing what I've been building on OpenLaw and how it relates to Ethereum and some of the opportunities I see there. So, you know, what legal engineering, anyways? It's basically transactional attorneys. I e. Corporate lawyers delivering transactional scripts that effectively mirror deal terms. Now, transactional scripts is kind of a new kind of way to talk about smart contracts.
00:00:44.722 - 00:01:51.370, Speaker A: And I saw a very interesting discussion last week between two law professors that are active in the space talking about what exactly are smart contracts? Are they legal agreements? If you have a smart contract, do you have some sort of privity? No, they're just business optimization tools. They're a way to take legal agreements and reflect them in ways that are more automated, more predictable. So transactional script, I think, is a better way to talk about smart contracts. But I digress. So really, as a corporate attorney that's learning how to code and specifically learning how to code assets, I see the following transaction costs constantly come up with legal deals payments, paying not only attorneys and coders for the deal itself, but also counterparties paying themselves, alice paying Bob on the 10th day of the week. All those fun things, these moving pieces that lawyers and other agents have to keep track of in order for contracts not to go into default, recording intentions of parties in a very obvious and durable format. This is important for dispute resolution, and it's something that I think is imperfect with how a lot of law firms organize your documents on centralized servers.
00:01:51.370 - 00:02:39.758, Speaker A: We've seen hacks of law firms. We've seen confidential information reach the market. So we're trying to think, how can we make things more cost effective, quicker, but also secure? And this kind of leads me to blockchain and some of the advantages I see for corporate lawyers who want to code and make things cheaper and better for their clients. Now, a blockchain has a few enticing properties I see for court reviews. It's a neutral database, so that means it's free to read and write from you don't need a gatekeeper permission in order to build on Ethereum or on other public blockchains timestamp. Tamper resistant record. That kind of goes into the neutrality of blockchain and that we have a very clear chronology of transactions and we also have a clear sense of how transactions might be reversed, what kind of economic force it would take.
00:02:39.758 - 00:03:11.894, Speaker A: 51% Attack we can think logically and clearly about how information can be erased. We can take some of the vagaries of centralized servers away because I see a lot of centralized servers as just ticking time bombs to hackers digital scarcity. So when you have an open free database that's tamper resistant and timestamp and very predictable. You can also think of online assets as scarce. We're able to solve for double spending problem. We have a greater, I guess guarantee that an asset that's represented online will stay. That way there won't be a million copies of it.
00:03:11.894 - 00:03:57.080, Speaker A: So all this goes to having internet native or blockchain native assets. So Alice paying Bob on 10th day of the week is not just an instruction to a bank, it's literally the payment itself. And that's what we can do with smart contracts. Why Ethereum? I think basically the easiest pitch is that there's been so much development in the area of business transactions and what is being fondly called Money Legos. The sense of Ethereum has all these different ways to move value online. Whether it's stablecoins, whether it's something that might be more speculative like Ether or security tokens, it's all there and it's being built in real time. And for lawyers like myself, we're trying to get a sense of like I only have so much time to learn how to code.
00:03:57.080 - 00:04:43.554, Speaker A: My clients might have confusion about all these different blockchains out there. It seems useful to just go with the momentum and go where a lot of developers are going. And I see them going through Ethereum because of things like MetaMask, which is MetaMask, which is kind of like a universal passport to Ethereum and blockchain that anyone can get on Google or Firefox. If you know how to use the internet, you can get MetaMask. Dai is a stable coin that helps people pay each other using blockchain without exposing them to volatility risks. So it's kind of like this core bedrock for finance. And then OpenLaw, my employer, is a way to wrap all these different web three money Lego tools and clear legal terms that can be understood by humans and I guess more importantly by judges if things go wrong.
00:04:43.554 - 00:04:59.190, Speaker A: I know it's like I'm saying, it's just smarter agreements that are enabled through code. And now I'd just like to quickly get through some demos because it's one thing to kind of lay out this in theory, but I think it's way more useful to just see in practice.
00:04:59.270 - 00:04:59.930, Speaker B: Ralph?
00:05:01.150 - 00:05:02.300, Speaker A: Oh yeah, sure.
00:05:03.470 - 00:05:32.366, Speaker C: Is there any work being done either with open law or startup called a Contract wrangler on NSF around creating a spec for contract types. But just so that aside from putting things on channel, you could say, well, is this contract supposed to do X and Y and Z independent of whatever language it's written in? The contract should work this way, so that way you can do it testing.
00:05:32.398 - 00:06:23.534, Speaker A: Suites form where yeah, so I think there's a lot of overlap with open source development and where I see legal templates going, they're converging on market standards. So at OpenLaw we're very keen on saying we don't want to have 100 different ways to do a business deal. We want to find the market, the one form tune at them all. And with that we want a template smart contract that is also covering most of the things people want to do with a certain deal. So what I'm going to show next is my sense of what that standardization might look like for sales of online goods and arbitration. But I hope that was responsive to your question. So first demo is just basically knocking out a build sale on my phone with MetaMask wallet and also oh, and also programming a smart contract.
00:06:23.534 - 00:07:12.050, Speaker A: I should be too bloody about it. Again, this is on a phone, this is accessible to anybody. These are free templates. This is just actually this is important. You can see me reviewing the bill of sale that I dropped on an OpenLaw then also deploying an escrow contract that matches that bill of sale. Now what do I mean when I say matches? What is the point of all this? When I say match, I mean that the parties specified in this bill of sale, buyer and seller are reported to a smart contract factory that I deploy so that there is a unique cloned escrow smart contract that comes out that only these parties can access. And it also reflects a certain amount that's being paid in this instance, ten die for my sneakers.
00:07:12.050 - 00:07:55.122, Speaker A: And that's what will actually be divvied up if this transaction goes through and people do what they're supposed to do. I could probably talk more broadly about why escrow is a good use case for Ethereum, but I do feel like I should move ahead. This is also an example of just using legal forms on your phone. You can also top up an escrow smart contract by sending a die. There's other buttons you might have noticed there that are options for the seller and buyer to initiate a scoop. And that is the next demonstration I'm going to show. Let's say that the buyer is taking way too long to pay for the shoes or they hated the quality, they smelled too bad, they might have want to dispute that.
00:07:55.122 - 00:08:53.846, Speaker A: And we can actually make this stay online. They don't need to go to a separate venue. So let me just move over here. Now, our would be arbitrator, should they be called to action play. I'll just tell you what this is supposed to show. An arbitrator does not need to know more about smart contracts or Ethereum other than this is what buyer should get, this is what seller should get and a sort you sign it, it reports this transaction to the smart contract. And then what we can actually also see in real time are those ten die, those digital dollars that are escrowed to induce completion of this legal transaction is then split up automatically after the arbitrator reports their results using open law form.
00:08:53.846 - 00:09:43.750, Speaker A: And I think this is pretty cool and that's a stable value. I think that's very familiar to people, familiar to Arbiters, the sense of digital dollars and how to split them up. So I think it's all kind of coming together in a way that doesn't need to pick a lot of technical knowledge, doesn't need to pick any ideological sense. It's more just efficiency. One thing I'm really excited about is tokenization, and I would like to show an example of how I am tokenizing, something called an income share agreement. So there is an alternative to financing higher education that's gaining a lot of popularity where students say, instead of taking out a loan or paying you today, I will give you a share of my income should it be above a certain amount. And we see this as advantageous to students.
00:09:43.750 - 00:10:43.746, Speaker A: But it's also a very interesting way to show how ethereum can map onto legal agreements and make markets more efficient. And what do I mean by that? Okay, so we just had somebody quickly fill out an income share agreement based on the Lambda School form. And then this agreement, after it's executed, will report information about that contract, about the parties to a smart contract factory that then gives something called Lisa Tokens that also bear a hash that's generated by OpenLaw. This is kind of complex and I think it's more relevant to attorneys. But there's this sense of like, what does it mean tokenize a house, what does it mean tokenize a real world asset? For me, it means creating a clear legal link between the relevant parties who might have control over that asset and something like a token. So somebody creates 100 tokens that represents their income share agreement. Those hundred tokens represent 100% claim on that student's future income.
00:10:43.746 - 00:11:18.530, Speaker A: Now, as an education provider, I don't necessarily want to wait a couple of years to get paid and have that uncertainty. I might want money today. And I can say, I can sell you these tokens and you can get a portion of that income share right automatically. And it'll be settled very quickly on Ethereum. And now more for little Boyers in the room. This is kind of the language from the random income share agreement that makes this all possible and programs two people to do what they're supposed to do. This is what I added to basically say that this income share will be represented by digital assets.
00:11:18.530 - 00:12:22.262, Speaker A: And we're also saying they're going to bear an ID that's created by OpenLaw for this specific contract. So I see that as a unique and contemporaneous link between creating a real legal obligation, something that somebody's going to have to do in the future, or else they get hauled into court and holding a digital asset that's very easy to access, very transparent and on a hearing. So I guess my takeaway and is knowing I have little time is that I really think the world's ready for this. There's fatigue with lawyers, with their presence on deals, the transaction costs, the back and forth that is often unnecessary with them comparing forms that should be market anyway. So we see value record services migrating online. We see more technical people becoming lawyers or just doing what lawyers do already by drafting their own agreements. So I think lawyers can steam ahead here and say we recognize this threat, but instead of vanishing into the foreground or retreating, we're going to embrace it and deliver new types of value.
00:12:22.262 - 00:13:04.980, Speaker A: And I think that new type of value is we can replace a lot of the transaction costs, a lot of the money that goes to other lawyers with just lawyer coders. So Escrow agents, banks, all these other parties that take value out of bargains, they can be eliminated with legal engineering. And that's my thesis at least. But I am optimistic. And I'm optimistic if this is built on Ethereum because I think ethereum is here to stay. There's a good energy there's, great community, and I think it's at the COVID of the world. You guys have any questions? I know that was a sprint, but I hope it gave you kind of a gestalt of what I'm working on, where I think the space is headed for lawyers, all that good stuff.
00:13:04.980 - 00:13:07.062, Speaker A: Yeah, you're going to first?
00:13:07.116 - 00:13:17.770, Speaker B: Okay. And this might be too broad question for this particular one, but how do you plan to address variations in international law and international trade?
00:13:18.510 - 00:13:39.790, Speaker A: Oh yeah, that's great. I mean, ideally the parties themselves that use this technology figure that out. Open law and myself, we don't want to be in the business of creating legal standards. We think lawyers should still be helpful there and team up with coders. Better yet, lawyers that are coders can quarterback that. But international law is very complex.
00:13:40.690 - 00:13:47.478, Speaker B: I guess the thing I'm worried about is the language barriers between legal legal systems.
00:13:47.674 - 00:14:10.380, Speaker A: That is also a really interesting point. Just like the Power of Babel problem for commerce. It's just like we have different languages and different ways to talk about liabilities. Cool thing about smart contracts is then I see almost this alchemical process of natural language agreements are going to be boiled down to the spare parts that are most necessary. Then the really important things are going to be reflected in the code that anyone can understand, regardless of.
00:14:16.590 - 00:14:30.138, Speaker B: What'S the upshot. The way that one interprets the word agreements is different in Italy versus in UK. How do you mitigate the fact that parties might not have had proper understanding.
00:14:30.154 - 00:15:35.110, Speaker A: Of yeah, that's cool. One of the things that I want on Applause is for people from other jurisdictions, other languages, to put it all there and then have the market kind of refine what form should be used and what agreement should constitute. But I do think contract law is pretty baked into most of our sense of deals and how we can control things. Judges, even outside of the US. Are usually differential between what private parties find themselves to do so if this technology wades into more regulated areas like securities transactions, then yes, there's variation and there's a deliberative process that's probably going to go with issuing security tokens as it should. But for invoice payments on Dai, I don't see a lot of bakeries or need for a lot of prospectal communication, like trying to figure out what it means to get paid for services. I think a lot of these things are very basic economic tools that it's convenient to have paper records just so if things really go south, you can reconstruct what people wanted and judges can make the result at speed.
00:15:35.450 - 00:15:43.350, Speaker B: So you're not saying that the same primitives from the standpoint of the agreement can be connected to different languages and translation?
00:15:43.710 - 00:16:21.326, Speaker A: Oh, I do think they can be, yeah. Okay, so the primitive of Escrow, why shouldn't that be universal? Like stolen funds on time, duration or something? Yeah, I think that's probably what we're going to see is, and kind of like my thesis here, forms and deals are going to converge. Like Latham forms are very popular for fundraising. We have CRC, we have the National Venture Association also has their market forms. I don't know how those work outside of the US. But that's mostly just my perspective as A-U-S. Attorney and a lot of the people that are talking to us about what they want to use open up for seems to have a US bias.
00:16:21.438 - 00:16:26.200, Speaker B: Yeah, I didn't mean to no, I'm very chill actually.
00:16:27.370 - 00:16:30.680, Speaker A: Please criticize. Give me stuff to work on.
00:16:31.610 - 00:16:33.378, Speaker B: What does the adoption of these kinds.
00:16:33.394 - 00:16:34.842, Speaker C: Of technologies look like?
00:16:34.896 - 00:16:40.826, Speaker B: Do law firms start offering digital services and disrupting themselves or what's your so.
00:16:40.928 - 00:17:37.142, Speaker A: My sense there is, and just like what I'm seeing already, is in house counsel and companies themselves investing in this technology to help them run back office processes. And that being the inducement for law firms to join party. I think law firms will probably resist this technology if they might have little one or two rules that study it. But I don't think they're going to fully embrace it until it's more or less an existential threat to their bottom line. And I see more of the adoption curve being with law firm compliance law firms themselves, although lawyers, sole practitioners, small law firms, in house counsel can see a lot of use here if you're not under this pressure to have large build up hours. So I think there is that tension between how lawyers account for their time and account for their value and what the work actually takes. Now what the internet has brought on just information being everywhere.
00:17:37.142 - 00:18:15.494, Speaker A: And as a lawyer at a big law firm, I would often be given a task and I would just go online. I would go to SEC filings, I would go to Law Insider, I'd use all these online tools and then we'd just take that information just put into our law firm database and then have that cook for a while. And when we talked to another law firm we compare forms but it's all kind of just internet. It's kind of like dirty secret or something. I think that will be exposed if there's real competition and I think there can be real competition with payments startups using these forms for invoice payments. Like we see some traction there but with a little complicated stuff. I think that jury is still out like M A deals.
00:18:15.494 - 00:19:18.462, Speaker A: I think it's still probably too early because those do take a lot of different I just haven't gotten there yet until historical. Any other questions? How much is legal background and engineering to get involved in? So this is always a very interesting question because like some founders I've met have better legal understanding than a lot of lawyers. But I would say that developers are complex problem solvers and that's very similar to what lawyers are doing. And if the developer understands the economics of a deal you can be helpful to the lawyer. I don't want to say that you can replace lawyer quite yet because like I'm saying I really like this contingency of the smart contract fails or we still have imperfect oracles where people have to report real world events to smart contracts. I like having a legal layer to that and that requires I think some legal training. But I think it's probably so I don't think law school should be three years.
00:19:18.462 - 00:19:36.258, Speaker A: Also that's another thing I can write about. Do you guys know Lincoln didn't go to law school just read mean you can still California and not go to law school and just read law and take bar exam get but anyways do.
00:19:36.264 - 00:19:42.750, Speaker B: You have a second? I've seen you tweet about LLC does. Can you touch on what yeah, no, totally.
00:19:42.830 - 00:20:46.054, Speaker A: So yeah, some of the work I'm doing at OpenLaw and beyond with Aragon and other teams is studying how can we make organizations more efficient with smart contracts. And the most immediate obvious use case is for grant making. Like if you're pulling funds together and those funds are already denominated digital assets it makes a lot of sense to use something like a Dow or a voting multi city. But it's like, okay if we're going to do that, if you're splitting money, if you're giving funds to independent contractors you're creating liability. So a lot of my thought process has been kind of this after fact sense of there's a lot of Dows out there that might be creating legal liabilities for themselves or having default assumptions about how they're structured that would surprise them. So why not clarify that with an LLC? I don't think it's that crazy to say let's settle who owns what and how liability should be distributed between Dow members. That's pretty common sense.
00:20:46.054 - 00:21:42.114, Speaker A: But I think as more lawyers are joining space it's becoming more of a theme of just like you guys are already acting as partners, why not make it so that you get sued and holding the court? The judge understands exactly what you're trying to do here, and you have protection predictability. So it's not very complex. One of the things I've been a fan of and had fun with through OpenLaw and aragon is just like an operating agreement in large part can be represented on chain. Operating agreements are just saying, like, who owns what, what their voter weight might be. And a lot of dows already represent that information, and they make it programmatic. So one thing that I'm working on is beyond just referencing a smart contract and an operating agreement and saying this is where the decision making goes, it's really cool to have the moment an operating agreement is executed, a deployment happened of a multi stick wallet, an aragon dow, a dowstack dao. Or a Molok dao.
00:21:42.114 - 00:21:57.980, Speaker A: And I think that is kind of going to be the next thing work on it's. Just like trying to make that more streamlined because I think a lot of people make it really overly complicated when law is introduced. So I guess that's kind of what I want to do at open law.
