00:00:00.170 - 00:00:56.960, Speaker A: I mean, for me personally, I think everybody at Teller would have a similar story in the fact that they were into something sort of unrelated or not developer related before getting into crypto. But me, it's even more so. Like, I studied art in undergrad and so how did I end up here? It was kind of a winding road, but basically for the early 2010s. Sorry, got lights shutting off here at the office. In about 2013, I started working as a consultant for a local in Baltimore, Maryland, bitcoin startup called Bitsy. They didn't last very long. Great guys.
00:00:56.960 - 00:01:49.742, Speaker A: They were creating, like, merchant services for local shops in Baltimore to accept bitcoin. They were real evangelizers for crypto, but they were way too early for that. It was an uphill battle for them. But for me, they introduced me to bitcoin and Ethereum and they were paying me in bitcoin. And I didn't even know at the time. I was just upset at the volatility of this stuff and I couldn't sell it fast enough because I had to pay my rent in bitcoin or I didn't pay it in bitcoin, but I had to cash out. And I remember waking up one day and I was just furious that it dropped like 20%.
00:01:49.742 - 00:02:33.898, Speaker A: And I was like, this is a rip off. But anyway, I end up keeping some of the I don't know what's going on with the lights here. Anyway, I end up keeping a little bit of it enough that it drew my attention. It drew my attention to the fact that this bitcoin was not worth something. And so what I did was I started to look into it and that's kind of how I got into crypto. I think a lot of people got into it through trading as well. And so I started to look at other cryptocurrencies and I dug into Ethereum and all the tokens that were coming out in 2017.
00:02:33.898 - 00:03:42.340, Speaker A: In 2016, I guess fast forward. In late 2017, I met my would be business partners and it was someone from my local town and he was hosting the local bitcoin meetup, one of these really small town bitcoin meetups that five people show up to have a beer and talk about shitcoins. But I found out he was a developer and he just started a startup and wanted to do something with decentralized derivatives on Ethereum. And I was like, whoa, what is that? Oh, you can actually do something more than just trade these things around. That was at the time, was mind blowing to me and really interesting. And I was a consultant for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and so I loved that whole spirit. So I ended up going out for a beer with him and know, he, you know, started working at this office, this one right here.
00:03:42.340 - 00:04:17.840, Speaker A: And I just brought on my friend Brenda and she's going to help out. You should come to the office one day and that's kind of how it started. I showed up and they had just started this thing called Decentralized Derivatives Association and we're building this derivatives protocol on Ethereum and I sort of just stuck around it kept on coming and worked for free. I don't know if I'm over answering your question, but this is totally leading into the history of Teller. If you want me to go there.
00:04:18.210 - 00:04:35.170, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean that's exactly leading. Okay, yeah, that's perfect. It sounds like sort of you were, in a way very early member of sort of what has become DeFi right in the community and being able to have all these different derivatives and things.
00:04:35.320 - 00:04:42.360, Speaker A: Yeah, we were really early. We like to say we were in DeFi before DeFi was cool. Exactly, that's true.
00:04:42.890 - 00:04:46.454, Speaker B: I'd love to kind of hear about kind of the rest of that journey, I guess.
00:04:46.492 - 00:05:22.130, Speaker A: Yeah. So this was early 2018 now, and we got an Ethereum Foundation grant, which we were running on. That was our raise, so to speak. That's how we sort of paid the bills. So it's Nick, Brenda and I that started Teller, but we also the ones that started this previous startup. I'll tell you a little bit about them. They both left the government.
00:05:22.130 - 00:06:25.954, Speaker A: They worked there, we're all from the DC area, and they both left the government doing brenda was doing, you could say data science. And Nick was working for the CFTC, the derivatives regulating body of the and so he was doing research on cryptocurrencies for the both have they're both economists. So they left the government as economists to start this startup in early 2018. And we all sort of quit our day jobs and got this Ethereum grant to say like, let's make 2018 the year that we make this thing happen. It was originally called DDA. We rebranded to Daxia. What we were doing was we basically created a protocol where you could lock Ethereum into a smart contract and it would issue out these tokens that would represent the short and long side of that asset.
00:06:25.954 - 00:07:14.726, Speaker A: It would be bitcoin, for example. So we did short and long bitcoin tokens and these derivatives would last a week. And so at the end of the week, the contract would well, it needed an oracle, as you can imagine, where I'm leading to. But at the end of the week it would settle out and those tokens would then be you could redeem them and then that smart contract that was holding the Ethereum would divvy the right amounts out to the two parties. So at the know we were using a centralized oracle. There's a company called Orcalize well, actually they're called Provable now, formerly Oracleize, and they're a great centralized Oracle. It worked really well.
00:07:14.726 - 00:07:51.138, Speaker A: But for know, we were saying at the time we were the first decentralized derivatives protocol on Ethereum. But wait a second, can we really say that it kind of really stuck in our sides a little bit. We couldn't stand that. We couldn't solve the Oracle issue. And there wasn't a good option. Chainlink, even Chainlink wasn't live yet at the time. They were just a white paper and they were on testnet, and we sort of dug into it and it wasn't going to be right anyway for us.
00:07:51.138 - 00:08:50.198, Speaker A: We didn't feel like we thought it was centralized, so we sort of went to the drawing board. There was a hackathon in summer of 2018 in DC called Angel Hack. And we decided to hack up an idea I think we were inspired by. There was a project called, if you guys remember, Zero X Bitcoin, that built a sort of bitcoin protocol on ethereum. And so that kind of got our wheels turning about making a Mineable Oracle token. And that became like this thing called the Proof of Work Oracle. And after that hackathon, we had the sort of rudimentary bones for what would later become you know, we did that in the summer and we didn't really know what we had with, just we knew that if we couldn't find a better Oracle provider, like we had this thing we could launch with.
00:08:50.198 - 00:09:35.860, Speaker A: But it was still just a hack. So we just kept on being Daxia, and we were trying to raise money, and it just wasn't successful. We were having a hard time raising and we were running out of money. And at the end of it was very beginning of 2019, we had like one month left. We're all like, okay guys, we're all going to go get jobs again and do Daxia part time, and we're going to make this work. It was really depressing. And that was around the time that we heard about an opportunity for this thing called Binance Labs, which is Binance's incubator accelerator program thing incubation program.
00:09:35.860 - 00:10:18.260, Speaker A: And we met somebody at DevCon, DevCon Four in Prague that later on tipped us off about this opportunity. He's like, I think you guys would be good for this, and maybe that Oracle idea you're talking about would be something you could do. And so we went ahead and applied and we got in and we weren't like, Teller wasn't even a thing. Once we applied, we were like, okay, we better name this thing and give it a brand and a website. So we came up with Teller and we put together like a really crappy website and wrote a white paper and turned ourselves into a project. And we were so surprised that we got in. And that's how Teller became a thing.
00:10:18.260 - 00:10:51.580, Speaker A: I could go further into everything from then till now too, because that's its own story. We went out to know the Incubation program was in Berlin, Germany for three. Our Nick's got two kids. I had a pregnant wife and Brenda's sweet dog, Charlie. We all just uprooted our lives to go to a foreign country to build this project. It was a really cool time.
00:10:52.030 - 00:11:47.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we'll definitely get to talking about that too. I guess it's kind of funny to think about 2017 doesn't feel that long ago, but really the difference in what was available then and now, I think especially along that line of centralization versus decentralization is pretty stark. Right. There's a lot of new things that have come out in the last three years that have really enabled kind of full end to end decentralization within an app. Notably Oracle's being a big piece of that puzzle. Right. I guess sort know, going back, know, when you were kind of working with Daxia and kind know, thinking like, are we really decentralized? Know what are like, I guess what was sort of like for you, maybe the motivating factor for making sure that you really were decentralized the whole way through, why was that actually important? Right? I mean, that's what motivated building out Teller eventually.
00:11:47.150 - 00:11:51.040, Speaker B: Why is that the kind of mindworm that stuck with you?
00:11:51.570 - 00:12:46.286, Speaker A: Yeah. So we always have been this group that are very philosophically, philosophically, philosophically conservative in these regards. We have a strong set of values and we've always been like, no matter what we build, it's going to be decentralization first. It's going to be about censorship, resistance. Even with Daxia, we wanted to be even regulatory concerns we had, we wanted to make sure we did things the right way. And we didn't want to be like one of these ICO projects that were coming out because at the time, if you recall, it was crazy. 2017 was nuts.
00:12:46.286 - 00:14:03.322, Speaker A: And we saw all these projects raising money and we knew that they were junk because they didn't have anything but a white paper or an idea or even it was just a bad idea that we wanted to be different. And at the time, being different was actually being standing up for something and wanting to be truly decentralized and not just trying to do a money grab. And it was hard, it was hard to not fall for that because we were trying to do like I was saying, we were trying to raise and we couldn't raise and we're running out of money. And you see other projects that were doing something similar, but they would have one thing that would jeopardize our values that we couldn't do, but they could, so they win. We weren't going to create a token project that would end up having 60 or 80% of the tokens held by a couple of VCs and us. Because it doesn't matter how amazing your protocol is, it's still centralized because all the power is in the hands of a designed. We didn't have a token with Daxia, so we didn't have that problem.
00:14:03.322 - 00:15:01.230, Speaker A: But when we came to building Teller and we needed a token, we actually needed one to make it work. We were like, okay, so how do we do this without doing the ICO boom thing? And so we did no pre mine we settled on. We're not going to do a pre mine, and we're not going to do an ICO. No presales, no IEOs, which became the thing after ICOs. It was IEOs initial exchange offerings, which are similar, I think, but they all come down to, like, how can we get a bunch of your tokens in the hands of investors early on for way cheap and then dump them on everybody else? And okay, yeah, the project gets to raise a lot of money, and that can be useful because now you can become a business, but then you're a business that almost can never get out from under the shadow of your raise or your launch. Now it's called a fair launch. Sometimes you can't escape that.
00:15:01.230 - 00:15:08.446, Speaker A: And what incentive do you have if you're like, everybody's a multimillionaire at the company before you even done anything.
00:15:08.628 - 00:15:09.310, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:09.460 - 00:16:01.118, Speaker A: So that was a really long winded way of answering that. We got into crypto because, yeah, it's cool tech and it's cutting edge technology, and it's just fun to be a part of a new industry like that, but also because of the values behind Bitcoin and Ethereum and about creating unstoppable applications and censorship proof computers, those kind of things, what DeFi is supposed to stand for. So we didn't want to lose ourselves. And it's easy when you're just starting to say, like, I'm not going to lose my values, but when you're running out of money, it's like, maybe those values aren't so important, but exactly. We stuck to it. We stuck to it.
00:16:01.284 - 00:16:18.150, Speaker B: Yeah. It's good to hear. For those here on the call who weren't around in 2017, it wasn't a crazy thing to have people raising tens of millions of dollars on white papers. Right. Which was insane. Right. It was really, truly insanity.
00:16:18.150 - 00:16:52.670, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, to stick to your guns in that sort of atmosphere, I think that's very noble. Right. And I think kind of continuing on that trend, I mean, talking about sort of like where Teller is mean, teller also has a workshop that they had at ease online. So if you want to take a look at sort of how everything works under the hood, that's probably the best place to do it. But for this call, I'm kind of curious about sort of decision making that you're making at Teller. Right. Recently, you guys launched your V Two, which was very exciting, a bunch of kind of great improvements there around Scalability and that kind of thing.
00:16:52.670 - 00:17:23.146, Speaker B: But also, I think you mentioned that also that you burned your admin key recently as well, which is I think kind of fits really nicely with this narrative of very decentralized, censorship resistant so. I mean, love to kind of chat a little bit about sort of the thought process that went into actually burning that key, losing access to sort of the thing you've created in a way and sort of just kind of the process of actually doing that. What was that like and why now?
00:17:23.328 - 00:17:52.386, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so an admin key, for those who don't know is like this master switch that we could have in our contracts that allow us to make any changes we want to it. But what you use it for is to upgrade, to make upgrades to change your contract. But it could be used nefariously or maliciously. It's all powerful. Basically. It's important to have that early on.
00:17:52.386 - 00:18:40.514, Speaker A: You need to be nimble and things break. You launch the Main net and it's like it all could break. And you want to be able to quickly make fixes and you don't want to have to wait for this decentralized governance that doesn't exist yet and you don't have a community yet. It's okay to have an admin key. Most projects on Ethereum actually have them. I think the problem is that if there's a lack of transparency around the fact that an admin key exists and what it can do and not do, and also if you hold onto it too long, there's a period of time where it becomes natural for an admin key to be removed. So we've been talking about it for a while.
00:18:40.514 - 00:19:35.300, Speaker A: We launched to Mainnet in August 2019, and we always said that when we had demand on our Oracle, we got to a certain point where we made enough updates. We thought that we've been on Mainet long enough, nothing has broke or if anything broke, we fixed it and we made some updates that we now feel like our Oracle is ready and doing good on its own. Then we'll burn it. We no longer really feel like a need that we don't think this thing's going to break. And we've been around for a while, so we thought after V Two launch was a natural good spot to do it because V Two was a big upgrade and we wanted to launch that on our own. Yeah, we just felt like we've matured enough. You could still argue it's early, it's really scary to burn it because.
00:19:40.730 - 00:19:41.046, Speaker B: We.
00:19:41.068 - 00:20:44.042, Speaker A: Haven'T really established ourselves with a huge user base yet. And so the questions that you have in mind are, what if you have to adapt a protocol as you get data from your customers, you're in the market and you learn if there is one or not, and you can change. Like, oh, we found out that people wanted faster updates and so that was something we changed in V Two. Make our Oracle a little bit faster, things like that. You want to be able to collect that data and make changes, but now it's going to be slower, it's going to be more a decentralized process. The way that upgrades will work now is it goes to a token governance vote and you can imagine for anybody that follows Ethereum's like EIPS or it just takes a while. The community has to discuss things and they have to go through this draft process and finalizing and auditing and everybody's got to vote and you got to get people to vote and those kind of things.
00:20:44.042 - 00:22:06.180, Speaker A: But we're excited about that challenge, too, because now we have to be stewards of the community and we actually have to further develop our community and help that foster that growth. So that you do have an active, engaged community that can vote on the upgrades of something like Teller that ultimately holds quite a bit of value in its market cap and what it does for other projects. And that sort of goes back to why you want to build a project the right way. Because eventually you want to get to the point where your community is important to you, and so you want them to be really interested in you, and not just speculators, although speculators are important, but you don't want a community fully built of just token speculators that don't even care what you really do. And so building a community organically, having a token project, that's very organic, and it can be tough to grow a project like that. But ultimately we think it's going to benefit us now that we're here and fully decentralized, we think we have a great community, the great foundations of the community. So, yeah, cool.
00:22:06.630 - 00:22:07.054, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:22:07.112 - 00:22:07.430, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:07.500 - 00:22:24.700, Speaker B: I imagine as a software developer myself, sort of in a way, like pushing the code onto the CD drive and then shipping out the CDs is kind of equivalent to burning the admin key. The code is shipped, you can't touch it. Right? Yeah, that's pretty terrifying to me.
00:22:25.230 - 00:22:54.900, Speaker A: It was a fun day too. We invited some of our associates, people that have helped us on the protocol in our history. Not a lot of people, but for this tiny office, it was packed. Six people is a lot of people for us. We had champagne and everything like that and so it was like a big drum roll. And when you send the admin key to the zero address, it's gone. You can no longer call that upgrade function.
00:22:54.900 - 00:23:24.800, Speaker A: But nothing broke. Everything stayed working. And here we are. The real test is going to be V 2.5. And I know we didn't even talk about V Two, and we can if you guys are interested, we also didn't really talk about how Teller works. So if anybody doesn't know how Teller works, you can ask and I can give an overview of that. It might be maybe you all already are very familiar with us, which would be a good thing.
00:23:24.800 - 00:24:06.620, Speaker A: But so V 2.5 is coming out. We have these it's not as big as V Two, but they're important updates in terms of how our mining network functions. I can get into those details, but the point is that this is going to be a Teller improvement proposal tip. And so we've already written it up. I think tomorrow actually, we're going to submit it our plan is either tomorrow or early next week to submit that. Actually I believe it is already on GitHub, but we're going to share it with the community and then it'll go through this process.
00:24:06.620 - 00:24:28.706, Speaker A: I don't know how long it'll take as we get community feedback on it and it goes through an audit and eventually it'll go through a vote. So this will be our first upgrade that we're going to do that it's going to take us all we like to say we are teller and this is our first time. We can actually put our walk, the.
00:24:28.728 - 00:24:48.840, Speaker B: Walk about the first sort of full end to end experiment, basically. That's very exciting. Awesome. Cool. So, yeah, I did drop a note in Chat here. If anybody does have any questions, we can either do them live or if you just want to drop them in text, we can do that too. So maybe I'll ask one more question while people think if they have any questions.
00:24:48.840 - 00:25:32.760, Speaker B: Actually going back, you mentioned kind of the start in a way was at a hackathon, right? And I know when we first started talking as well about kind of EPON line and everything that you mentioned that hackathons and teller go way back, if you will. Right. So I guess sort of maybe if you had another chance to be at a hackathon right now, if you were maybe a hacker at Ethan Online, what would you be building right now? Or either what piece of the stack or what would you be thinking about building. And maybe if you could also speak to sort of the environment that hackathons provide and why they're exciting and also why they were a part of your history.
00:25:34.330 - 00:27:30.810, Speaker A: Well, so my immediate thought about what I would build is actually something that we're working on as a team now, so I can't really talk about it. But in general, what I think a good motto is for anybody that's getting into crypto and coming to hackathons and thinking about things to build is don't get sort of it's tempting to sort of try to hack on a project that's like the soup de jour, especially with all the yield farming stuff going on now. It's easy to get pulled into that and I think ultimately that won't lead you down the correct path for a real meaningful career or a real meaningful project. And so our motto from the get go, no matter what we are building and what we will build in the future, is build things that make sense, build things that you can build right now with current crypto technology and scalability specifically. And then build something that you ultimately want to be a part of long term because all these projects are a community, blockchain is a community. And so make sure that whatever you're making isn't just something that's going to be like it's going to make you money, but it's actually going to foster a community that you want to be ultimately a leader in and a part of and you'll be proud of. To go a step further, to be a little bit more practical, what that might mean is you can ask yourself, well, what really makes sense on a blockchain, ultimately, why would you use a blockchain over just a regular database? And what we believe is that it's really about unstoppable applications and censorship, resistance.
00:27:30.810 - 00:28:43.650, Speaker A: And it's not about making money, a lot of money or anything like that, or making digital versions of legacy finance, but it's about making something that's slow and simple, but it can't be stopped by any government or any one individual. And that's what's really cool about it. So these are areas that can be really improved on in all of DeFi. And so you can take any one of these projects, take a stablecoin idea, but think about how could I improve upon what maker is doing or whomever and not make it faster, but make it slower and more secure and more censorship proof. And that would be a really good niche to carve yourself if I was a hacker. Because you will stand out to people and there will be people that notice like, we're a project, we'd gravitate to someone like, you be like, you get it. And there's more people than just us that are like that, that get that kind of thing and we ultimately think that those are the people that are going to survive long term.
00:28:43.650 - 00:28:46.206, Speaker A: Totally.
00:28:46.318 - 00:29:00.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I think exactly right. I think building on the platform with the ethos of the original ethos of the platform right. I think that aligns just perfectly. Not about building.
00:29:01.470 - 00:30:22.180, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead. Well, you're not just building what you're building, right? It's like, what are we building exactly? What is like this whole community? What is the ethereum community building? What are we making here? Are we quickly going to become like what Web 2.0 was? Is Web Three going to just be a new Web Two with blockchain? I don't think that's what we want to build here and we could quickly get there, get there real fast and there'd be enough money that people would be like, what? What are you talking about? Censorship resistance? Nah, you could get there real fast. You also asked about just the events themselves, not just hackathons, but any convention or any event in crypto. Don't be afraid to make friends and keep in contact with people that you've met at these things, because they will. Every event we've gone to and every hackathon we've gone to, there's some relationship that we started there that at some point made a big difference for us. It later became somebody introduced us to a project or later gave us an idea that was a real inspiration for something we made or they just became really good friends.
00:30:22.180 - 00:30:37.080, Speaker A: It's kind of tough. You want to focus on building, but the relationship component is huge. That's one of the biggest resources to leverage at a hackathon, I think.
00:30:38.410 - 00:31:09.298, Speaker B: Definitely. Yeah. I mean, I couldn't agree more. I think one of the great things about the Ethereum community is that we have so many of these opportunities to intermingle, I think, and able to meet each other. And I think kind of just generally across the board, from what I found, almost everyone is interested in being kind of a positive promoter of what other people are working on, provided it's good and it follows the right Ethos. And there are a lot of people in this community, especially, that are so down to help and so down to be part of the story.
00:31:09.384 - 00:31:23.000, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I feel like people make it easy on you at these things. Sure. I'm not always the most I don't know, depending on my mood, I'm not always the most outgoing person. But I've never had a problem at a ETH event.
00:31:23.610 - 00:31:34.586, Speaker B: Exactly. Awesome. It looks like we do have a question from the crowd. So it looks like Jack has a quick question for you. Jack, if you're able to unmute your video, you're already doing it. Perfect. I'll turn it over to you.
00:31:34.688 - 00:31:48.720, Speaker C: Hey, how's it going? Hey, Mike. Yeah, I'm kind of new to the space a little bit, and I haven't gone deep into Oracles yet, so maybe the right question is, like, how does it work?
00:31:49.170 - 00:31:51.262, Speaker A: Yeah, no, we didn't even get into sure.
00:31:51.396 - 00:32:08.200, Speaker C: Yeah. And that would be great to know, but yeah. What kind of data do you see? Can Teller take real world data and ever port it to the blockchain in a decentralized way? I'm trying to think of how that would work.
00:32:09.050 - 00:32:11.240, Speaker A: We do that. That's exactly what we.
00:32:13.290 - 00:32:19.240, Speaker C: You know, if the sun comes up today, how can you prove that the sun came.
00:32:21.070 - 00:33:16.250, Speaker A: So we could do that. That's not what Teller does right now. We do numerical data and we focus on pricing data, but the fundamentals of it would apply for something like that as well. It kind of goes back to how did Bitcoin solve? Like, how do you validate data in a network? And the concept was you use a competition and a set of incentives to incentivize honest and honest behavior and disincentivize dishonest behavior. And so we sort of took that idea. And what we did was this will go into how Teller works, is that we use competition. We built a proof of work protocol in a smart contract on Ethereum.
00:33:16.250 - 00:33:57.560, Speaker A: And we have miners that they're not Ethereum miners, whatever. They specifically run a Teller miner. And basically what happens is, like, a user would come to Teller and request, let's say, some sort of off chain. When you say real world data, what that means is that anything other than what's on Ethereum to Ethereum is off chain data. It could be in the real world, the Internet, so, like, a bitcoin price is off chain. And you. Have to get that from some real world source, whether it's a person or an API or an exchange or something like that.
00:33:57.560 - 00:34:37.346, Speaker A: And ethereum can't read. That's called the oracle problem. Like Blockchains can't access off chain data. So anyway, so someone is on Ethereum, they want the bitcoin price or they want to know did the sun come up? Or they want to know what the weather was on this date. You could create a network of individuals that have to compete for the right to say what that data is. And so well then how do you incentivize honesty for them to be honest? Well, you can give them a reward just like bitcoin issues, bitcoin. So we have a token.
00:34:37.346 - 00:35:11.040, Speaker A: Our miners get rewarded in TRB. But also in order to participate in this network, they have to stake 1000 TRB, which is right now roughly $20,000 worth of TRB. And that can be slashed if they're dishonest. And so now you have an ability to dispute these data providers. So you have an anonymous open network, anybody can come and join. You don't know who they are really. And you have the proper crypto economic incentives in place.
00:35:11.040 - 00:35:21.202, Speaker A: You can bring almost any data on chain that way. Yeah. Did I sufficiently answer the question?
00:35:21.336 - 00:35:30.406, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. So I guess the incentive is they lose $20,000 if they give the wrong.
00:35:30.588 - 00:36:09.890, Speaker A: Price kind of thing. So you could read anybody in our network can see these submissions on chain. We actually have a dispute center. If you go to disputes tellerscan.com, you can actually see the mining events as they're coming in live and they happen every we have five minute blocks which is just like the time period for our updates. And you can see that these submissions come in. I'm sort of backing into describing how all the details of Teller but I'll go ahead and continue.
00:36:09.890 - 00:36:53.646, Speaker A: We actually for each request, like if someone wants the bitcoin US dollar price, we actually take the first five submissions in the whole network. The first five miners that solve the proof of work computation and submit their bitcoin price from whatever source they want could be an API, like from Binance or something or Coinbase or whatever. Or they could manually put in what they think it is. We take five and then we medianize. We take the median of all five. And that gets posted on chain as the official value into a readable contract that projects can read from and get that data because now it's on chain. Shoot.
00:36:53.646 - 00:37:30.698, Speaker A: Where was I going? Oh yeah. And so you can see all those submissions happen and you can click dispute and basically you pay a dispute fee. The important thing is you also have to properly incentivize honest disputers. Right. You could spam the network if Disputing was free and you wanted to shut down teller, you could just constantly dispute every value and take them all off chain. If it was free, you'd be like, I think they're all bad. But how do you want to you want to make it so people will only dispute if it's actually a wrong value? Like someone submitted one dollars for the Bitcoin price.
00:37:30.698 - 00:38:20.074, Speaker A: It's clearly a malicious act. So it's actually quite expensive to submit a dispute fee. But anyway, you submit a dispute fee, and then it goes to a vote of our community, and there's a whole voting process, and there's a ways to dispute the result of a dispute. So we have a pretty robust dispute mechanism, and that's the bulk of our security, is that none of these values on chain are 100% final. There's a concept of finality in blockchain. It's called probabilistic finality. Have you ever sent something on a centralized exchange? You have to wait like six confirmations for your Bitcoin transaction to go through.
00:38:20.074 - 00:38:25.294, Speaker A: Those confirmations are actual. Each confirmation is a new Bitcoin block happened.
00:38:25.412 - 00:38:26.080, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:27.170 - 00:38:43.314, Speaker A: The idea is that the more of these blocks that have happened since your transaction, the more probabilistic it is that it's final. Meaning the network won't fork. If I'm confusing you, just let me know.
00:38:43.432 - 00:38:48.130, Speaker C: No, it's like an asymptote or it approaches finality.
00:38:48.210 - 00:38:48.614, Speaker B: Kind of.
00:38:48.652 - 00:39:24.478, Speaker A: Yeah. So for us, there's such a great incentive. Oh, I should add this thing. When someone disputes a bad value on teller, if you successfully dispute it and we all vote that that was a bad value, you get that miner's stake. So the disputer gets rewarded, that miner gets slashed, and it goes to the the you could call them validators almost, that they can comb through all the data getting submitted from teller and make sure it's clean. And if they find it's almost like you want to be the fastest person. We don't have a lot of bad values that come on chain.
00:39:24.478 - 00:40:03.262, Speaker A: They're pretty rare, but when they do, it's like payday for somebody, obviously a bad one. And so they don't last on chain very long. So for us, the longer a value has been put on chain by our network, the more probabilistic it is that you could consider it a final price. Like, it won't get disputed. It'll stay on chain. And so we recommend this is why being slow is safer. Makers Oracle has a 1 hour delay, their security module, which means that their prices are all delayed an hour.
00:40:03.262 - 00:40:25.910, Speaker A: That way it gives people, their community, a chance to correct something. If something really bad happens with their Oracle, it's an hour delay. So all the prices are an hour old. But that's really good practice. The longer you wait, the more expensive it would be to break that price. Does that make sense?
00:40:26.060 - 00:40:26.760, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:27.850 - 00:40:38.300, Speaker A: Same thing with Bitcoin. The longer you wait, the less incentive financially, anybody would have to do something malicious. Yeah. Okay.
00:40:39.470 - 00:40:44.410, Speaker C: That's really cool. Yeah, that's a cool system of checks and balances.
00:40:45.310 - 00:41:09.730, Speaker A: And that's what crypto is in a nutshell. Sometimes all this stuff is hidden behind all this code, but in the end, it's really about the logic. It's not really about the computer science element, although that's a huge component. But there's this crypto economics thing that really is where all the sweetness is, I think.
00:41:09.880 - 00:41:24.566, Speaker C: Yeah, that's really cool. Well, thank you for explaining that in a nutshell to me. Back to Jacob now, and thanks for the founding story, too. I found that really cool. I'm glad you went into or both of you went into so much detail on that.
00:41:24.668 - 00:42:13.894, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is a cool story and I hope it inspires you guys. But yeah, usually off chain data in DeFi right now is pricing data. Right now. That's what's most in demand. Because, look, if blockchains are slow and secure, what are you going to want to transact in? It's usually high value transactions that are going to make sense on a slow but secure blockchain. You're going to want to do some sort of betting contract or some sort of financial contract that's got a lot of value writing on it if you're going to waste your time on a blockchain. And so that's why DeFi is the thing on Ethereum right now.
00:42:13.894 - 00:42:24.842, Speaker A: It's because these are all high value financial contracts, right. So it's important to be slow, but that's why we're focusing on pricing data. Cool.
00:42:24.976 - 00:42:25.850, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
00:42:25.920 - 00:42:28.022, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Thanks for the question, Jack.
00:42:28.166 - 00:42:36.560, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks, Jack. I think we probably have time for one more question, I think. Vincent, do you have a question about why your hand is up?
00:42:38.130 - 00:42:39.390, Speaker A: Hey. Yep.
00:42:39.730 - 00:42:41.710, Speaker B: All right, I'll turn over to you then.
00:42:41.860 - 00:42:43.358, Speaker A: Hey, Mike. Hey, how's it going?
00:42:43.364 - 00:43:43.620, Speaker D: Thank you. Pretty good. So actually that was like a really perfect segue to what I was going to ask. My interest is on focusing on what the future looks like, what the pipeline looks like for incoming data types that aren't just pricing pairing and also pairing it with. So I'm curious to know what you think is coming down the pipeline outside of that. Is it amounts of relatively high value information or is it more like boolean truth versus false? And then I'm curious on also what you were saying at the end there, which is because it's on a blockchain, which means cost is high to handle the transaction. What does the future of Oracle's being fed onto layer two solutions look like where it could reduce that pricing and potentially bring on not necessarily high value, but still really important data that could benefit from this?
00:43:44.390 - 00:44:30.082, Speaker A: Cool. Good question. We've heard a lot of people talk about insurance being one type of data type that makes sense on a blockchain. I've yet to see really a good implementation of that, but that makes sense. And it's something that Oracles could definitely provide, like weather data. That was something that at least earlier this year or late last year amongst the Oracles people were talking about insurance and weather data and things like that, but I don't know any farmers that are using blockchain for their insurance yet. But so it's just sort of like a concept and things like that might be far away, away.
00:44:30.082 - 00:45:23.954, Speaker A: I think DeFi is here to stay for a long period of time. The other thing that we've sort of thought about, you can use Oracles to bridge chains. So we've talked about separate from atomic swaps. Well, like using Oracles to pass blockheaders back and forth and somehow validate data that way. That whole scenario is not my expertise at all and we haven't really dived too far into it ourselves as a company. But those are two areas I think could be interesting. But one thing that we tend to not look too far ahead, a lot of times people ask us what's our two year, five year, ten year plan? And it's like in crypto, you can't you got to keep on your toes and focus on the here and now.
00:45:23.954 - 00:46:25.142, Speaker A: And we pay attention to what's going on, of course. And things happen so fast that if we think about what we were thinking about last year, I'm glad that we're not doing that now because everything has changed. So that's why it's important to stay nimble as a company. Stay small, stay lean, stay aware, stay engaged, because things happen rapidly. And who knows how things will be different once things start to scale at Ethereum. And as far as layer two goes, are you familiar with Matic? So we're actually building out onto Matic as our first sort of foray into layer two because they're basically like I mean, they're just really easy to work with. And so we're excited about the experiment of that.
00:46:25.142 - 00:47:22.220, Speaker A: We're excited to see how that might help us in terms of speed and cost, being able to have an Oracle over there that has greater capabilities, speed wise and scaling wise, than it does on Ethereum. Potentially. These are things that ultimately, though, we haven't seen yet, is we haven't seen a real demand on any of these, either fast layer ones or layer two solutions. We haven't seen enough apps on there demanding Oracles, otherwise we would be building over there. And so a lot of our solutions for layer two, a lot of our solutions period, kind of require people to be using them for it to make sense, to build it. And so we've been hesitant to launch on these things, but we're going to do one on Matic very soon and we're excited to see what that does.
00:47:23.230 - 00:47:25.610, Speaker D: That doesn't exist at this time.
00:47:25.680 - 00:47:26.298, Speaker A: Right?
00:47:26.464 - 00:47:28.218, Speaker D: You guys are building that right now?
00:47:28.304 - 00:47:44.240, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's really close. We were on their testnet, we were just talking about it this morning. It's pretty imminent for that. Are you looking to build something on Maddox that needs it?
00:47:44.770 - 00:48:39.620, Speaker D: Yeah, we're tool agnostic. It's more of what our need is. There's two different things going on here. There's my hackathon project, which is reviewing security and building some grading system around different Oracle feeds paired with different Oracle technologies, paired with different DApp architectures and trying to help new DAP developers are focusing on more real world buildouts. Get sort of caught up because we see as probably the greatest weakness for real world applications coming onto the blockchain. And then my day job, we're focused on building settlement layers and marketplaces for electric microgrids so they don't rely on traditional banking services. And so for us to be very beneficial to be able to plug in smart meter data, energy consumption, feed it in.
00:48:39.620 - 00:48:46.790, Speaker D: It's not urgent. We can do that later time, but we're trying to see if it's something we could put in the first version.
00:48:47.930 - 00:48:49.240, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah.
00:48:50.730 - 00:48:55.094, Speaker D: Well, it's not the layer value of like a layer one.
00:48:55.292 - 00:48:56.374, Speaker A: Got you. Obviously.
00:48:56.492 - 00:48:57.206, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:57.388 - 00:49:00.310, Speaker D: Counterfactual sort of enforcement.
00:49:00.470 - 00:49:33.940, Speaker A: Well, I'll tell you what, we could connect offline and stay in touch. And as you're thinking through these things, we love to just think through them with people, especially if it's related to even if it's not related fully to Oracles. But we like to think about this stuff and help people make the right decisions in the design phase of these things. And so, yeah, just reach out to me and we can start a little chat and just keep in touch about it, whether it's for your hack project or something else.
00:49:35.050 - 00:49:35.558, Speaker B: Sure.
00:49:35.644 - 00:49:36.182, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:49:36.316 - 00:49:39.960, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Thanks for your question. Thank you.
00:49:41.370 - 00:49:49.258, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks so much for that. There's that kind of helpful conference meetup connection thing we just talked about. Yeah, it's happening in the live that.
00:49:49.264 - 00:49:50.378, Speaker A: Was a live one.
00:49:50.544 - 00:50:03.306, Speaker B: Awesome. Cool. Well, thanks again, everybody, for basically taking part. Thanks for your questions, thanks for your participation. And Mike Big, thank you for coming out and spending an hour with us.
00:50:03.408 - 00:50:04.774, Speaker A: My pleasure, my pleasure.
00:50:04.902 - 00:50:11.918, Speaker B: Had a great time chatting. And, yeah, it was awesome to kind of detail the whole story and how it works and how we got to where we are.
00:50:12.004 - 00:50:36.790, Speaker A: I hope it wasn't too all over the place. It was like stream of consciousness there, but I hope you guys followed. And like I told the last gentleman, any of you guys, if you guys are too shy or something, you can reach out to me or anybody on the team. If you're a developer and you want to ask more technical questions, our CTO is we love talking to people, so don't be afraid.
00:50:37.290 - 00:50:55.214, Speaker B: Awesome. And yeah, just for everybody, of course you can find them in the sponsor teller channel. Of course they've got prizes for using Teller. So if you need data in your app, that TRB, come get that TRB. Exactly. So they'll be around the whole event, so don't feel shy at all. Just like what Mike said there.
00:50:55.214 - 00:51:00.798, Speaker B: So awesome with that. You know, we will wrap this up. It was great chatting. Thanks again for your time.
00:51:00.884 - 00:51:01.498, Speaker A: My pleasure.
00:51:01.594 - 00:51:02.570, Speaker B: Catch everybody on discord.
