00:00:00.250 - 00:00:02.046, Speaker A: Tom, do you want to?
00:00:02.228 - 00:00:04.046, Speaker B: The stage is yours and I ask.
00:00:04.068 - 00:00:06.286, Speaker A: All panelists and moderator to turn on.
00:00:06.308 - 00:00:18.030, Speaker B: Your camera while everyone else turn off your camera. Cool. The questions for the panels have been shared in the MEB WTF agenda.
00:00:19.410 - 00:00:25.360, Speaker C: Great, I think we're all here. Do you want to do like a round of intros to start? Maybe? Vaughn if you want to.
00:00:26.090 - 00:00:38.790, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Yvonne. I've been doing mev research for a while and particularly front running, and then I'm advising Dragonfly Capital and Building Mining Dao, which I think Tom mentioned in one of his previous slides.
00:00:41.370 - 00:01:02.714, Speaker A: I guess I'll take it from here. Hi everyone. I'm Uri Karlman, CEO and co founder of Blocksroute. We've been working on the network layer of blockchains, which has a lot to do with DeFi and front running and pretty much get your transaction faster to pools. Also with my hat off backrun me, which Tom mentioned earlier. And it's super cool to be here. Kind of like here with Tom and Ivan and Joey.
00:01:02.714 - 00:01:10.180, Speaker A: This is kind of, whoa, all the friends stand together and kind of go, let's do a panel together. Jaron I know less, but this is an opportunity.
00:01:14.720 - 00:01:37.540, Speaker D: Joey hi, everyone. I'm Joey Zachrol and I'm a founder at Keeperdao, where we provide infrastructure for capturing and distributing mev to users and keepers and a variety of others as well, with the goal of making DeFi more secure and profitable. And my background includes trading, market making, automation engineering, decentralized exchanges, and cybersecurity.
00:01:40.360 - 00:01:59.550, Speaker E: Hi. My name is Anton. I'm co founder of One Inch. I'm also interested in discussing different blockchain related things like consensuses of different projects, tokenomics, and of course, minor extraction value.
00:02:06.480 - 00:02:08.270, Speaker C: I'm sorry, I don't know how to pronounce your name.
00:02:08.960 - 00:02:10.030, Speaker B: Yeah, hi.
00:02:10.400 - 00:02:34.120, Speaker F: Yeah. So I'm Yaron, founder of B Protocol. We shift profit to the users in learning. Previously, I was CTO of Kyber network. We were doing a lot of on chain market making and previously one of the founders of Smart Pool, which was the first decentralized mining pool on Ethereum.
00:02:35.740 - 00:03:17.510, Speaker C: Awesome. I'm glad everyone could get together. This is really like a stacked panel. So I'm glad you guys are all here. I guess we've sort of been talking a lot, I think, at the event about where does mev come from, who's taking it, what do you do as a protocol? These are kind of around like, mev mitigation techniques and things like that. But I think at a certain point, to an extent, mev is always going to exist. And so I think the question is almost like, is there a fair distribution of mev in your mind? Which actors do you think sort of deserve some amount of mev, and how do you actually go about achieving something like that?
00:03:18.600 - 00:04:06.180, Speaker B: I can try to volunteer on this one. I guess the way I think about mev is kind of after you've accounted for everything, mev is what remains. It's kind of this weird thing at the edge of a protocol. And so I would say kind of fairness is a second order thing. It's much more important to minimize it and kind of by the time you defined what it is and what fairness is, you might as well fix it. And there are specific examples of that where at least like half of all mevs like front running, uniswap and even flashbots, which kind of started on the idea of making it fair. Right now, it's kind of this backdoor way of solving it where you could now send transactions privately on 85% hash rate or you could do use background me.
00:04:06.180 - 00:04:22.170, Speaker B: And so kind of if you can do kind of the ten x step and avoid front running, why would you work on kind of redistributing it fairly? It doesn't super matter whether it goes to a kid doing of the bot, it's kind of worse if it goes to a pool, but still fine.
00:04:23.980 - 00:05:21.692, Speaker A: I'd like to start maybe by saying what is a really unfair distribution or a bad distribution. And I think the situation and this, I think, goes kind of like against the idea of Flashbots here, which is something kind of like I want to push against. Is that the idea? If we really optimize and maximize so you have, like, searchers trying to get as much mev as possible, and then they try to outbid one another and almost all that value goes to the pools. And pools being competitive with one another would probably be forced to pass these revenues to their miners. So they'll keep just a tiny thing and that goes back to the miners making mining more competitive. Therefore more miners join and we spend more electricity on mining and we took all that money, we passed it along leaving very very small crumbs along the way and eventually paid it all to electricity companies. So that would be an unfair way.
00:05:21.692 - 00:05:54.680, Speaker A: So I think I'd kind of like want to point out that when thinking about fairness, it's not like well, the user should have it, it's about how much the miner should have. I think it's important maybe not to optimize it to a race to the bottom. Maybe try to think about it as can we have some reasonable like X goes to the miner, Y goes to the user, but not to make it an optimization race, which at the end of the day, might be worse off. Even if it's, like, economically optimized.
00:05:56.460 - 00:06:55.556, Speaker D: And you're essentially taking something that has some negative connotation to it and kind of spinning it and making it healthy and livable and help it make the system grow and distribute to various other people involved. And so the way that we like to look at the various parties there's users, there's keepers or searchers. You could even consider liquidity providers. There's DeFi products, and then there could even be a market maker, which could be like an automated user or automated liquidity provider. Trying to kind of make this mev something more healthy and less unhealthy and distributed around makes a lot more sense. Especially when you focus on the users who historically were kind of I guess abused and sandwiched and front run and tailgated, yet they receive zero of it. A lot of times they're actually the ones who are responsible for making the profit opportunity to have existed in the first place by some action that they performed.
00:06:55.556 - 00:07:12.130, Speaker D: Maybe it was a lending position, maybe it was a trade that they made. And so as mentioned earlier, if these kind of leftovers as a result of people interacting with these protocols, generating these mevs opportunities, you may as well distribute them.
00:07:15.620 - 00:08:05.090, Speaker C: That's maybe a good segue to sort of the second question, which is it seems like a year ago or two years ago really the answer was sort of like it's some sort of split between miners and bots and people sort of participating in PGA. And now everything that we're talking about is sort of shifting this mev to DAOs or to individuals directly. Sort of like with background me. For example, which of these do you think is kind of more likely to prevail in the long run or maybe in the next few years? Is it sort of individuals basically get to reap their own mev? Maybe you could argue RFQ is something like that or background or something like that or like a DeFi saver or something like that. Or do you think it's going to be sort of more dow fied where the liquidations and the ARBs go back into some sort of pool on chain and we all sort of sort of benefit from it?
00:08:05.940 - 00:09:10.100, Speaker F: Okay, so maybe to answer the first question first, I think in my opinion fairness in mev is eventually the point where traders and users don't need to have some kind of specialized personal connections or business connections with the players in the ecosystem. For example miners, et cetera, which eventually they must have some in order to become profitable. And eventually this just keep players out of the game. Very similar to how now you cannot be a serious algo trader if you have unfair benefits in centralized exchange. You know, me as an average trader will not go into BitMax because I have no fair chance there. So I think same should be applicable also for DeFi. And right now if you have to have some connections with miners or have some specialized knowledge to use the flash loan boats, et cetera.
00:09:10.100 - 00:09:15.300, Speaker F: So in my example this is also some kind of unfairness in mev.
00:09:16.680 - 00:09:29.720, Speaker C: Yeah, that's very I guess that's sort of the flashbot's idea, right? Which is like okay, we can do it, but make it kind of auction and transparent so everyone gets access to it instead of having some special hookup with a miner.
00:09:31.580 - 00:10:20.540, Speaker A: And Tom, to your question, I think maybe me and Joey are kind of like on the two end of the spectrum, kind of like between Keeper and I'm not sure me and Joey feel very bad about it. I think both options are kind of okay and both are livable with right. You could do something like Keeper in which the platform itself has all these actors. So it's a dow, it's a protocol or whatnot? And users can come into that knowing, oh, what are the pros and cons? And so maybe they know what they're getting into and if it's not competitive, they'll go somewhere else. And therefore just like if Uniswap takes 0.3% and that's fine. So maybe Keeper taking the mev and if that's comparable, then that's also fine.
00:10:20.540 - 00:10:25.608, Speaker A: And so there is a question that's one I think okay, solution.
00:10:25.784 - 00:10:26.316, Speaker B: Our end.
00:10:26.338 - 00:11:09.080, Speaker A: On our end, we, you know, who mentioned it earlier was it Hasoo that I think so that providing the order book is actually providing value. If I'm kind of like the transaction stream me as the user has the power, I can make this trade here or there. Like I could choose to do it on CFI or DeFi or which protocol specifically. So I'm going to want a piece of the profit if you want my transactions. And so the user will hold some of it, I assume a bunch of it will go to, again, whether searcher or miners or whatever, but definitely the user holding a significant piece. And I think maybe that kind of defines a spectrum.
00:11:09.600 - 00:11:20.428, Speaker C: Yeah, this wasn't intended to be sort of like what you think is right or which you think is ethical. It's more like what you think is more likely. And I guess the other question is, is there a third option I kind of see people on?
00:11:20.514 - 00:12:01.384, Speaker B: So I was going to just say since Uri and Joey offered kind of the two opposing options, I'm going to do a third one. And I think this is kind of like a more long term hypothesis, but curious what you think. So if you think, okay, who really owns mev? It's like, is it kind of the anime avatars on Twitter? Do they own the information that the user is trading on Uniswap? The answer is, of course, no. They were just like the first to figure out you could extract value that way. And so now that there's a lot of anime avatars on Twitter, 90% of that goes to the miners in terms of fees. But if you ask, okay, do the miners own that? The answer is still no. The miners are entitled to be paid for block space, but not for the full value of the transaction.
00:12:01.384 - 00:13:06.480, Speaker B: If somebody is trading a billion dollars, they're not entitled to extract all of it. And that's the core of the mev crisis. But there's private transactions and so on. And so if you really kind of unroll that game into the future and try to think who actually owns the interactions, I think the answer is wallets because there's nowhere up the stack to go and kind of wallets are the ones that really do the user interaction. And so I think kind of the long term outcome is kind of that value accruing to MetaMask or maybe nosis safe because it's like that's where the big transactions are or like fireblocks and so on and by the like if you guys read Money stuff by Matt Levine which is fantastic, if you don't you totally should. He keeps saying know crypto rediscovers traditional finance kind of step by step and Stumbles in All The same places. And so I would say maybe now is the time to rediscover the Robinhood plus Citadel type sort of payment forward or flow situation where there's, like, the wallet that owns the user and some are azure that sort of does the back running but not the front running.
00:13:06.480 - 00:13:12.492, Speaker B: Kind of like the way background me does that. And so I would hypothesize that to be the long term equilibrium.
00:13:12.636 - 00:14:07.616, Speaker A: So that's a really good interesting point and so first of all I'll say don't say bad things about like anima on Twitter zero x two would come for you. I'm not saying second that's an interesting like I love this thesis here. This is like, oh, you think it could go up to the wallets and wallets would be happy about it. Because up until MetaMask started to make money, I think like a year ago or something like that, there was a huge question of how wallets are actually going to kind of monetize all their users. And it wasn't that easy for them. But then I'm not sure I agree that's the last step like if you have MetaMask and MetaMask is making tons of money in comes I don't know, competitor number one and says you know what, I'm going to give you exactly the same experience and I'm going to give you part of that. And so it goes back to I think the user the user is standing on top of the wallet.
00:14:07.616 - 00:14:25.364, Speaker A: Maybe the wallet will take a chunk. There's a question of network effect and which one would use what. But I'm not sure I agree with you that well it has to stop there. I would argue that a user can totally choose to use a different wallet if the wallet passes a big chunk of these balance both agree and disagree.
00:14:25.412 - 00:15:08.730, Speaker B: So first off definitely love the fact that there's a way to monetize wallets. They've been sort of sitting on they've been doing useful things for years and years. But then second I think kind of wallets are this scary thing to replace with your seed that could get stolen. So I think there's definitely kind of a baseline where if I'm getting paid like a cent I'm just not going to do this. And then finally kind of the other part of that equation is once you're trading on one inch on uniswap there's no back runs and there should be no front runs in the first place. So I definitely agree with you that sort of mev as a percentage of the ecosystem tends down to zero. But as the ecosystem explodes, wallets are still in a pretty good position to capture kind of a small percentage of it.
00:15:09.580 - 00:15:50.550, Speaker D: I think back to the comparison of individuals versus dows. I think that line is a little bit blurred too because dows really are made up of individuals and dows tend to cater towards the individual and kind of try to empower them as a group. And then even if you want to think about it from the searcher or the Keeper's perspective, you could have a Keeper. I actually know someone, and I'm one too as well, who essentially would use this tool and that tool they may use background Me and they may use Keeperdao and they may also use Flashbots and anything else as well. So I think the line is a little bit blurry there. I don't necessarily think that just individuals or just dows or just some a third option has to win.
00:15:52.200 - 00:17:23.190, Speaker E: Yeah, guys, let me add I'm pretty sure everyone typed what happened to Flashbots. After Flashbots was launched, some of the DApps started to exploit Flashbots to hide from flashboard active users. So even like in one inch we have Flash transactions. It's not working with MetaMask but would work with your ledger because MetaMask will send it to mempool. It's not possible to prevent it, but you can put your transaction into flashboards and it will be mined without disclosure before it will be included into blockchain or in case of reordering reorganization, it could happen that it will be shared. But what I actually think that mev belongs to users and we need some kind of layer one protection like blockchain layer protection from front running and from abusing users. Because right now I believe that miners and all these arbitrage traders, they are handling all these issues but they are trying to earn things which not belongs to them.
00:17:23.190 - 00:18:17.300, Speaker E: And there are a number of projects who are working right now on general prevention of front running but not back running for sure. I heard of Metrolabs and Stackware. So in the perfect world we would see maybe VDF based solution to prevent phone running. Back running is not that much a problem for user because it usually happens because of inefficient trades. If user shifts the market significantly and this creates arbitrage opportunity, anyone can background this transaction to earn this inequality on different prices.
00:18:18.840 - 00:18:34.484, Speaker B: As far as mev belonging to users and you mentioned Flashbots as well, so do you think basically Flashbots plus one inch solve mev? Or at least not the liquidations, but at least on the sort of buying and selling side like there's no front runs, there's no back runs.
00:18:34.532 - 00:19:04.150, Speaker E: No, I think actually it's abusing of flashboard functionality and next step, Flashbots should share these bundles with everyone who would like to listen. Like, if any service would like to use Flashbots to just send transactions, flashbots should share these bundles with anyone, to allow anyone to replace these bundles, rub these bundles to do anything with these bundles. Because.
00:19:06.360 - 00:19:22.200, Speaker B: I agree it is abusing. But it's a good thing, right? They've built this thing and now you could use it sort of for the user. And as they transition to SGX, there would be a way to do this without even relying on honesty assumptions. It doesn't matter sort of how we ended up here, right? It seems like a solution.
00:19:22.620 - 00:19:30.670, Speaker E: I believe it will work only on short term. In next version, Flashbots would just share these pending bundles with everyone.
00:19:33.040 - 00:19:34.444, Speaker B: I wonder if Tina wants to find.
00:19:34.482 - 00:20:04.020, Speaker A: On this, but I want to be contrary again for a second. There is a very big difference between front running and mev. And we're all kind of like focusing. Well, back running is solvable. If you just route it around to everybody, raise the entire market. And it's not entirely true because you'll raise the entire market, but what about CFI, right? So you can do DeFi CFI ARB, and you can't do that from within DeFi. But maybe unless you're moving giant chunks of money, I think maybe it's good enough.
00:20:04.020 - 00:20:36.464, Speaker A: But mev is about minor extractable value, right? If you're the miner, you're about to create a block and all of a sudden price crashes on coinbase. You see that and you're the miner and you can put a transaction. You're not front running anybody. I think Sonny called it the blind front running or something like that. The idea of the miner has value which it can capture because it organized a transaction. It's something which I think is inherent and we're not going to solve that easily. So maybe we can solve front running.
00:20:36.464 - 00:20:56.900, Speaker A: But I'm not sure that's the current thing. I'm not even sure it's the big thing. I'm not sure if you'll be thinking about DeFi CFI ARB, whether that might not be a bigger opportunity than the front running individual transactions of people on DeFi. I don't know, but I think so. Or it's at least a possibility.
00:20:59.820 - 00:21:30.770, Speaker C: Your note on sort of like CFI DeFi are a bit and I think sort of like a lot of the complicated strategy that we're seeing now is maybe a good segue. I'm kind of curious what you guys are seeing, maybe specifically Joey and Yvonne as sort of like the frontier of the bot space. I think generalized front running seeing some of these generalized front running bots operating the Mempool has been pretty surprising to me and I think a lot of other folks. But are you seeing other novel technologies that people are employing, or what do you sort of see as the end game for sort of bots in DeFi right now?
00:21:31.400 - 00:22:46.004, Speaker B: I can take a yeah, so far all the pending transactions have been public. And so my understanding is most of generalized controlling bots have essentially been copy bots. The idea is like, oh, can I send the same transaction but from my address and make that money? And then it becomes like a cat and mouse game where if you kind of invented the strategy yourself, you want to sort of complicate this so that people are not able to steal it, and then you sort of try to decomplicate that and so on. I think Flashbots is a major change in that landscape because, again, all the strategies you could submit privately and so these copy bots would no longer work at all. And I don't think they do anymore. Even right now, at 85% hash rate, there is just no point. And so I would say that now these generalized I don't even know if it's like the most money to make or whatever, but at least kind of the technological frontier and sort of the frontier of what's interesting would be the bots that just take the new block and try to figure out, okay, what the hell are the new opportunities that came up in that block? And I think the first approximation to this is Mithrail.
00:22:46.004 - 00:23:21.904, Speaker B: If you guys have seen this tool, it's like a security analysis tool that just magically transforms the VM into this symbolic execution and tries to find pathways to make more money. And it already has all the tooling for that. And I think the author Bernard Miller even built this into a tool that's called, like a Scrooge Mac Deal Face or something where he literally tries to do that thing and sort of extract the money. I looked into it. I haven't had such a great experience. If somebody manages to use it even to birth a CryptoKitty, send me an email. I'd be impressed.
00:23:21.904 - 00:23:35.390, Speaker B: There's definitely a lot to work on, but oh, Scrooge Mcface. Yeah, I think kind of that's at least kind of the way to think about it. In a way. We built Deep Blue and AlphaGo. We may as well build something like this.
00:23:38.160 - 00:24:25.716, Speaker D: Yes, I see a lot of separate ecosystems forming and even coexisting similar to how, say, our oceans consist of unique marine life ecosystems all within the same planet. So we have a variety of strategies that historically would thrive on public mempool. Nowadays, we also have strategies that thrive using tools like Flashbots. But then there's also even more specific task oriented automation projects, say, like Numer, AI or Gelato. These are maybe less related to mev, but still very much related to botting. But then I say generalized front running does kind of seem to be an end game for some ecosystems. But then private mempool kind of changes the rules and economics.
00:24:25.716 - 00:25:06.388, Speaker D: So, for example, we're building a Keeper coordinator that essentially enables users and keepers to kind of coordinate together. It prevents things like gas auction, spring triggers. So it's essentially a walled garden, right. But the idea here is you focus less on competition and front running and more on just efficiency. But in this type of environment, you really want to cater towards the coordinator's algorithm, right? So the algorithm is essentially designed to maintain a healthy ecosystem, so it changes the strategy, right. But again, back to the separate ecosystems. I think you may ultimately see generalized front running kind of just solve certain ecosystems, but then private mem pool is kind of totally separated.
00:25:06.388 - 00:25:20.940, Speaker D: There could be tools and technologies and skill sets from generalized front running applied to even private mempools. But at the same time you're kind of more catering to whatever the coordinator know, whoever's setting the rules in that ecosystem and the walled garden.
00:25:22.800 - 00:25:27.548, Speaker A: Tom, we kind of like jumped question three, which I really want, I do.
00:25:27.554 - 00:25:55.190, Speaker C: Want to go to I just thought we were talking about bots, so I kind of to want go into it. But yeah, if you guys are down, we can sort of jump to question three or question four now, I guess, which is good basically about sort of the shift to proof of stake, which is sort of rapidly approaching. I'm curious how you guys sort of view maybe the second order effects of the move to proof of stake with respect to mev, what are some things that maybe we're not thinking about or not seeing right now?
00:25:56.600 - 00:26:44.680, Speaker A: So I thought of it a bit and I have my own opinion, which seems to be, again, not a lot of people think that way and I would really like to definitely joe and Avon. Yaron, I know you less than that, but really maybe get some pushback on this. But my perspective is that we saw that mev was what, $700 million in the past 18 months or something like that. And we all talk, well, 700 million, that's tons of money. But then when I'm thinking about the move to POS and it's kind of like I'm thinking, okay, we're going to have validators run by really large organizations. Coinbase is going to be a big validator, binance is going to be a big validator, a bunch of others are going to run the validators. And when you think about the large stakeholders, just think whether they are centralized or decentralized.
00:26:44.680 - 00:27:47.050, Speaker A: If ETH is worth $200 billion or so, and if DFI tokens on top of it is another $50 billion and just Coinbase is another $50 billion, we're talking about a total value of businesses and tokens and economies on top of ETH, which are worth in the order of 400 $500 billion. So $700 million per year is nothing. I would argue that those who are betting big on ETH and stuff built on ETH are better off running vanilla nodes, not capturing mev because the value it generates is larger than capturing mev. If you think about the legal risk for Coinbase to doing these kind of things, instead of I just take guess I run it or not guess, because like Prism or whatever and I really don't want to screw anybody over because the legal around it is a nightmare. I'm not going to risk it for my share of $700 million per year.
00:27:47.740 - 00:28:24.730, Speaker B: You asked for pushback and you're not going to get any from me. I think I agree 100%. And people, there's this phrase that cryptocurrency works better in practice than in theory. I think it's one of those cases where kind of honesty assumptions become even more believable as we transition to proof of stake. And so Anton worried that what if one of the Flashbots participants ends up kind of trying to screw the system. I think it's kind of even less likely in the proof of stake shift. And so you could just run Flash bots on the Coinbase nodes or back on me or sort of any kind of private mempool and that might just be the simplest end game.
00:28:25.580 - 00:28:38.060, Speaker F: But why do you expect regulation concerns or legal concerns where these days regulated exchanges in the real world do give different priority classes to different users?
00:28:40.000 - 00:28:49.630, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that is true. If it were we were talking about something like a uniswap or something. But this is like Coinbase running.
00:28:52.240 - 00:29:15.530, Speaker F: You have Nasdaq exchange giving different priority classes to different players. So why coinbase can't I'm pretty sure that Coinbase centralized exchange give different classes of service right now, right? So it's not really something that is unheard of in the real traditional world, even in the regulated space.
00:29:16.140 - 00:30:06.360, Speaker D: I also think that you don't want to assume the value of mev in the future just because it changes dramatically. One thing to keep in mind is that every time ethereum scales you get more users, more protocols, more products, more exchanges. And history shows that every time that happens, you're multiplying mev opportunities which then further emphasizes the need to capture and distribute to MVV. But an example would be kind of thinking back to the days of the first few DEXes popping online and the first big mev opportunities. It was great. And then all of a sudden the third and the fourth and the fifth came online and it was like lightning striking and just kind of just rejuvenated everything. The bots were going wild and more bots were coming online and everyone was reverse engineering other people's bots.
00:30:06.360 - 00:30:49.140, Speaker D: And then add in the fact that Stake is fundamentally more liquid than hash power so someone could very easily double down on their stake. But with mining hardware you can't very easily do that, right? So if suddenly mev just multiplies and multiplies and multiplies and all of a sudden maybe you have people kind of doubling down on their stake and trying to grow their pool. Maybe they are now incentivized to use that ability to just instantly increase their pool size, use that to somehow capture mev with some of these tools that are available that could be. Very tempting for a lot of folks, even like a coinbase.
00:30:50.040 - 00:31:25.452, Speaker A: So to your last point, you talk about hash power being less liquid, but there's a giant difference between mining pools who are capturing this value and miners. And so miners make what, $10 billion per year. So even for them it's nice. 7% increase is nice, but it's not that big for mining pools who capture just 1% out of that. That's a whole lot of money. And so that's a bit on that. And to Yarn's point about, well, coinbase is already and Nasdaq are giving like priority.
00:31:25.452 - 00:31:56.430, Speaker A: I think there's a big difference between giving priority and colocation and access to flow compared to, oh, accepting bundles of sandwiching just from a legal perspective or I think there is a difference. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not sold on the fact that the value of mev is great enough in order to push really big stake like people who are betting billions of dollars on ETH and protocols on top of it.
00:31:57.280 - 00:32:13.650, Speaker D: But what if these tools like, say, Flashbots or mining dow have nice privacy features where all of this stuff is just kind of wrapped in and they're just mining, they're just kind of running their software and everything's built right in. They're not intentionally doing anything, it's just kind of happening.
00:32:14.900 - 00:32:25.476, Speaker A: It's a good question. I don't know the answer, but I'm not sold on that. The obvious answer is of course mev, like as we see it right now will be in POS the same way. That's kind of like my point.
00:32:25.578 - 00:32:27.590, Speaker D: Yeah, it's certainly going to change.
00:32:31.720 - 00:32:49.290, Speaker F: Mev is only 100 of millions where east will be trillions, but is trillions because there is some expectation that most of the future financial transactions will be on Ethereum and then also mev will be orders of magnitudes higher.
00:32:50.940 - 00:33:36.430, Speaker A: I agree, and correct me if you think differently. I think that mev is subtracting from the value of Ethereum. The fact that you can't just transact on uniswap, but you have to do all sorts like, oh, I have to make sure that you route my transaction for back running and I have to use services to avoid front running and all these kinds of things. And even then, if value is extracted, it's extracted from somebody. So my argument is that ETH would become more valuable and the protocols on top of it if mev is mitigated minimized and not happening. So that's kind of my argument, that they're betting more on ETH and the value there rather than benefiting from capturing mev value. Does that make sense?
00:33:38.160 - 00:33:43.496, Speaker D: What better time to talk about fixing things when you're adding new features and adding upgrades?
00:33:43.528 - 00:33:43.676, Speaker E: Right?
00:33:43.698 - 00:33:50.620, Speaker D: That perfect. Time to introduce something new, to fix something when you're say transitioning to e two proof of stake.
00:33:51.760 - 00:33:54.768, Speaker E: Antoine had a comment, let me add a little bit.
00:33:54.854 - 00:33:55.104, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:55.142 - 00:34:27.980, Speaker E: I agree that Ethereum will became more variable with all these protocols working on top of it, but I believe also that miners, no matter proof of work or proof of stake but yeah, let's talk about proof of work. They will never be properly aligned with the network interest and inspiration. Because we also can see this on this old topic of block gas limit.
00:34:29.120 - 00:34:30.940, Speaker A: You want to talk about ego?
00:34:32.880 - 00:37:03.608, Speaker E: Let's not dive deep into it because it's holy wire and I'm also not sure that right now flashboards works not to hide that mev is happening but I believe if this would affect someone's reputation then some system will appear that would allow to hide that this mev is happening. It will not be easy to prove that miner is doing this mev, it will look like someone is front running someone I'm not sure if Miner is involved in this right now flashbots were not trying to hide this, you know what I mean? But if this would affect reputation they would find a technical solution to prevent tracking of minor and also switching from proof of work to proof of stake. I believe that proof of work, guys, they are not properly aligned and I believe they will never be aligned with the interests of hold the ecosystem because they don't care if this just transfers of either transfers of tokens. Or really complex DeFi transactions but proof of stake guys they are more likely be aligned but this is also nature of network upgrades because right now everyone is waiting like next hard fork and this ethereum improvement proposal 1559 but there is also a case that miners will not like this improvement proposal and will upgrade to any other hard fork, excluding this EEP. Because right now they're forced to get this hard fork with all these ethereum improvement. Proposals just because of this time bomb of proof of work. And at some point in future they will be able to exclude some ethereum improvement proposals.
00:37:03.608 - 00:37:10.610, Speaker E: Possibly. And everyone who are ethereum developers, they will not be happy about it.
00:37:14.260 - 00:37:34.970, Speaker C: I think that's a fair question. I think it's a fair point to end on. We have I guess one sort of point or question from YouTube lauren says mev is going to be more pervasive in proof of stake as selected validators will be able to reorder transactions over several blocks instead of one. I'm curious what you guys think about that.
00:37:36.300 - 00:37:39.000, Speaker B: Isn't it harder to reorder on proof of stake?
00:37:40.140 - 00:37:41.930, Speaker C: That would be my impression but.
00:37:45.120 - 00:37:45.484, Speaker E: I.
00:37:45.522 - 00:38:30.152, Speaker A: Don'T see the logic in it being easy on multiple blocks. It's going to be easier in terms, you know, your turn is in three blocks from now so it does open an angle which isn't open right now. On the other hand, right now with proof of work and the probability around it, if you're one of the top three, you know, you have like well 10% or so right now ether mine, right with the change of hash power moving away from China, that's 25% of the hash power. So in 12.5% of the cases, they mine like two blocks consecutively. So I'm not sure it's going to be more pervasive there that you're going to mine. Like, it's hard to say at this point how decentralized the Validator landscape is going to be.
00:38:30.152 - 00:38:35.496, Speaker A: Nobody knows, I think, and it's definitely opening angle, but I'm not sure.
00:38:35.678 - 00:38:59.090, Speaker B: Yeah, reorgs are honestly pretty implausible. But now that Uri mentioned it, you could have like a multi hope agreements, right? Because you not only know your turn, other people know their turn. So if you want to do like a ten block sensory, you could have a service that's like opt in. And once kind of people doing the next ten blocks opted in, I think that could be an avenue for me.
00:39:00.500 - 00:39:08.390, Speaker A: You can pretend to be multiple, right? You're running ten different validators. Sometimes they will be consecutive. You'll know, it coming ahead of time.
00:39:08.920 - 00:39:28.332, Speaker B: That much is the same as mining, right? It's like, okay, you run a bunch of them, but the probability that you'll be stacked like all of your Validators are going to get stacked is very low. On the flip side, if you can sort of scour the whole world for people who also want to opt in and find the next guy after you and then the next, that could be an attack.
00:39:28.466 - 00:39:30.110, Speaker A: That's not a happy thought.
00:39:31.280 - 00:39:33.900, Speaker B: Well, we're not here to hitch. Think happy thoughts.
00:39:36.560 - 00:40:03.400, Speaker E: Guys. Sorry, I came up to idea it's related to what you was just discussing. Let's imagine that Mev appeared with 1 billion of US. Dollars, how many network reorganizations we would see in next 24 hours, possibly that every miner would try to remind this block.
00:40:04.460 - 00:40:25.550, Speaker A: And that's why Mev is dangerous, right? Originally I wasn't in favor of Mev, but that's definitely one of the top two reasons for something like Flashbots. The other being Flashbots did an amazing job removing the whole gas bidding, like where I am in the block. And now we're all enjoying really low fees because of it.
00:40:26.640 - 00:40:31.004, Speaker F: But actually reordering is one thing that is solved by proof of stake, right?
00:40:31.202 - 00:40:32.924, Speaker A: True. Good point.
00:40:32.962 - 00:41:11.868, Speaker B: And Anton, more on your example. I think if we actually think through this, I'm not sure if it's that bad, right? If there's at least a few honest miners, it's like they mine on top of one of the blocks just by being naive. And then you have a bit of an advantage and then the others are at a disadvantage. So that's one defense. And then the second defense. If literally everyone is remining, I think the miners quickly realize that I'm not winning this, no one's winning this. And then they could do a thing where they sort of shift the Mev onto future blocks that are like, hey, I'm going to take, let's say 30% of this, and then 70% goes to the people who mine after Me.
00:41:11.868 - 00:41:20.672, Speaker B: And then that 70% is also split. It's like, okay, I'll mine on top of you. I'll take the 30%, you get the rest. And then it's kind of this you.
00:41:20.726 - 00:41:22.210, Speaker A: Thought about it a lot.
00:41:24.820 - 00:41:26.348, Speaker B: That's why I'm on this panel.
00:41:26.444 - 00:41:28.480, Speaker C: Yeah, that's why we got all the killers.
00:41:28.820 - 00:41:34.230, Speaker E: Should this be also implemented inside node this kind of logic and also test it.
00:41:39.320 - 00:42:32.370, Speaker B: I think proof of stake kind of like solves it anyway because people are not going to be reminding this and I think Flashbots were also thinking about this a while ago. They had the idea that there was then scuttled to route everything through a smart contract and part of the things you could build there is kind of you programmatically enforced in a smart contract that you stake something or give something to the future. And I think kind of another way that came out in practice was when finance got hacked for 50 million, and people were also debating it's, like, oh, but what if they sort of instead of just taking the loss, they essentially offer the private key as a bribe to the miners. But then the miners would fight, but then they would pay a little bit to the next blocks. And so kind of that debate came up and kind of people thought of that solution and I guess it's doable in theory at least.
00:42:33.660 - 00:42:44.980, Speaker C: I think that's a happy thought to end on the billion dollar. Mev thanks everyone for joining. This is a really great panel, really great team and yeah, I guess we'll see everyone on Twitter.
