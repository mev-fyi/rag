00:00:07.340 - 00:00:09.010, Speaker A: Okay, the stream is up.
00:00:10.420 - 00:00:51.790, Speaker B: Great. Hello, and welcome to everybody joining us on the call today. We are really excited to have Gabriel from Tachyon team to chat a little bit about how you can take your hackathon project to the next level. After submitting your project for hackevace, gabriel is going to do a quick presentation and there'll be questions at the end that you can ask. Feel free to unmute yourself or drop questions in the chat if you prefer a few notes just before we officially kick this session off. Submissions are due this Thursday, the 6 August. Please remember to have a look through the judging and submissions guidelines before you submit your project.
00:00:51.790 - 00:01:22.010, Speaker B: You will have also noticed that we have just opened up the judging slots on your hacker dashboard, so please sign up for your slot this week. And lastly, trends Andrew have put together another demo session scheduled for today at around 130 p. M. Pacific, and this is just a really great opportunity to get some feedback on your videos before submissions close. So with that, I will pass the call on to Gabriel, who can give a quick introduction to himself and kick the session off.
00:01:23.340 - 00:01:38.104, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you, guys. Thank you, Emily. Thank you, Trent. Excited to be here to talk to all of you. Been taking a look at a couple of the projects that are starting to come through. Really impressed with all of the projects at this year's hackathon.
00:01:38.104 - 00:01:58.784, Speaker A: So we're excited to talk to all of you. I'm going to share my screen so I can get into the presentation and maybe Emily or Trin if I can just get a thumbs up. Can you guys see my screen okay? Are we good? Yes. Awesome. Cool. Awesome. Well, yeah, I'm Gabriel.
00:01:58.784 - 00:02:23.064, Speaker A: I'll introduce myself real quick. I'm the managing director of Tachyon. Tachyon is a Web three accelerator. As a part of consensus, I'll talk a little bit about that more here in a second, but excited to talk to you guys about the Filecoin Launchpad accelerator, which is coming soon. Let me click my screen here. Okay. There we go.
00:02:23.064 - 00:02:50.816, Speaker A: So I thought how we would spend our time today is first. Yeah. Want to share with you guys a little bit more about the upcoming Filecoin Launchpad accelerator. It's in partnership with us in Protocol Labs. Talk a little bit more about Tachyon for those of you that are looking to take your project and move it into a full time startup. And then we've seen a lot of hackathon projects over the years. Tachyon has been around since 2017.
00:02:50.816 - 00:03:35.250, Speaker A: We've invested, we've been the first check in to a lot of early Web Three startups. Over 29 projects I think, to date. We've seen a lot of both successful and unsuccessful projects try to make the pivot from project into sustainable full time startup. And so I thought what would be helpful as a part of this session is to talk a little bit about some of the patterns that we see that successful teams or successful projects have made as they make that transition. And then we'll go right into Q and A. If you guys have any questions, would love to meet some of you and talk to you about. For those of you interested in Tachyon or any advice that we can give on any of your projects, be happy to do that.
00:03:35.250 - 00:03:56.010, Speaker A: Cool. So just a little bit about Tachyon. Tachyon is a part of Consensus Labs. It's part of our tier venture business. We've incubated and invested as a part of Consensus Labs more than 100 projects and companies, including some of the key pillars of the Ethereum Ecosystem. So these are companies like infura MetaMask, Truffle, Pegasus. Three box.
00:03:56.010 - 00:04:36.224, Speaker A: Tachyon, as I mentioned, is our accelerator. We've run three programs for early stage Web Three startups. Since 2017. We have 29 active alumni, including companies such as Newo, which is the same team as the Juno team, quiddly, transac Outlet, Finance, Pydow, and just some other really amazing companies. Our last cohort was a DFI specific cohort, and so we've got a number of DeFi projects that are starting to become some of the pillars within the DeFi Ethereum Ecosystem. I guess a little bit about our team, really. Tachyon was built by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs.
00:04:36.224 - 00:05:14.556, Speaker A: I'm a three time startup founder myself. I've built companies in the Prop Tech and Fintech space, two time entrepreneur. So that's basically being an entrepreneur inside of a larger holding company. In that role, I built a media publishing business up to 100 million mau. But I've spent a lot of time both in my own startups, advising startups, working with startups. I've got a lot of startups that have not succeeded on my track record and a number of that have. And so again, it's all about pattern recognition, really trying to understand how startups can make that successful.
00:05:14.556 - 00:06:00.924, Speaker A: Pivot brian Dell, who's one of our program directors, one of my partners, used to head innovation strategy at Quartz, he's also a multi time entrepreneur. And Monty Prakash, who's one of our associates, actually founded a social enterprise while in NYU. So just a little bit about our team. Again, we love working with early stage companies, especially in the Blooming Web Three space. I think there's just so much activity happening in the space and we really love getting close to entrepreneurs and helping them try to make those really fast turns as they grow their project. So the filecoin launchpad accelerator, we've partnered with Protocol Labs to launch our fourth cohort. And so really excited about this upcoming cohort.
00:06:00.924 - 00:06:43.070, Speaker A: Again, I've seen some amazing projects already as a part of Hack FS, so really, really would encourage any of you that are looking to make kind of that transition into looking for funding and trying to turn your project into a full time startup. We'd love to talk to you. I'd love to meet you. We're looking for early stage teams that are building open interoperable and programmable tools for the distributed web through IPFS and Filecoin. We're not limiting applicants to people that are just building IPFS and Filecoin. If you have a project and you're IPFS or Filecoin curious, we would love to meet you. And Tatia applications are currently open.
00:06:43.070 - 00:07:05.780, Speaker A: We can talk a little bit more about this during Q and A, but they're open until August 21 and then the program is going to kick off in September. It ends in December, culminating in the demo day at the end of January. The program will be fully remote. That allowed us to do two things. Number one, get a lot more scale work with more teams and more projects. And one, not be so US. Centric.
00:07:05.780 - 00:08:29.420, Speaker A: I think this is a global technology. Ethereum is a global technology. So we're really excited about seeing teams from around the world as they try to scale up their startups. And obviously, I guess the third point would be just acknowledging the existence of living in a COVID-19 world. It'd be really hard to ask teams to come into New York, which is where the TAC Young headquarters is so cool. The opportunity, I think, really trying to help teams think about and assess. Is this a project or is this a company? There are a couple of, I think, key questions which I'm going to go into detail here in a second on, but what market are you playing in? What's the size of the market? Who are your users? Are you able to build a community and what does that look like? What are you building? What's the technology solution that you're building? What's your team composition I think, is really important? What are some of the major blockers and challenges and then what's your time commitment? So as you start thinking about is this a project that you want to continue tinkering on? Is this something maybe that you want to extend some runway via grants? Or if you want to turn this into a venture size or scalable product or project, these are some of the questions that you want to ask yourself as far as what to expect from Tachyon.
00:08:29.420 - 00:09:22.130, Speaker A: Accelerators are really about helping entrepreneurs speed up their process to becoming sustainable, scalable, venture backable companies. And so we really give companies all the tools that they need as a part of Tachyon to scale quickly and move really fast. So first is obviously capital. We're investing $80,000 into your company. We are usually the first checks into a company at a precede or seed stage, however you want to think about it. But really we want to give you the capital so that you can make this a full time endeavor and really focus on this. Building a startup is an all encompassing endeavor and so we want to make sure teams have enough capital, enough runway as they launch their business.
00:09:22.130 - 00:10:18.210, Speaker A: The global networks that we have access to both the Protocol Labs networks in addition to the Consensus networks, whether they be technical, subject matter experts, just a range of mentors and advisors. You can go to our website, Labs consensus. Net to see the list of mentors and advisors. As a part of this know early stage investors. We work with a lot of know that are looking at early stage companies as they come out of Tachyon. In some cases we're able to help you with your initial customers and then fellow alumni. Again, we've got 29 alumni that are actively building in the Web Three space and having that network is really about opening doors, helping you gain access, and having that network can really help you move quickly as you build your company.
00:10:18.210 - 00:11:17.140, Speaker A: As a part of the program, we give you access to tools. Obviously, if you're familiar with Consensus, we literally built the Web Three stack and so whether it's giving you direct access to tools or credits through our program services stack called Tachyonos, things like Infuria, like MetaMask, like Codify, if you're in the D Five space and then finally experienced entrepreneurs. Our programming officers are held by myself, Brian Monty and a range of mentors and advisors who are startup veterans and can help you think about some of those trap doors as you build and scale your startup. Cool. So let's talk a little bit about turning your hackathon project into a sustainable product, into a sustainable business. Again, we've seen just so many hackathon projects apply over the years to Tachyon. The transition from hackathon project or project to building a company can sometimes feel a little bit like a daunting process.
00:11:17.140 - 00:12:38.400, Speaker A: There are just so many things that you have to think about that you have to get right, the sequence of events that you have to get right. What things do you focus on when really having support as you start to make that transition and knowing what to focus on and when to focus on what I think is really a key differentiator in the projects that succeed versus the ones that don't. I think this is the biggest single, one of the most important things that I really want to touch on. We've just seen, again, so many projects try to make the transition. When you go from a project to a startup, I think the biggest transition that you are going to encounter the biggest transition that you're going to have to make is going from building what you want to build, like building from your instincts to really starting to focus more on users, on customers, on your community and understanding what is it that your users want? During this presentation, I might use the word customers or users or community. I'm using those three interchangeably. But again, we've just seen so many hackathon projects that were just really good projects, but when they tried to transition from a project to a sustainable product or successful startup, they failed.
00:12:38.400 - 00:13:33.820, Speaker A: I think this combination of really being user centric, user focused, while also being able to build a community and build in public, it's one of the best ways to figure out what your users want. This ability to build a community and build in public and really understand what your users pain points are and being able to build what they want is one of the biggest, biggest differentiators that we've seen from the projects that make that successful transition compared to the ones that don't. So I would screenshot this slide. Again, it's very simple in description. I think it's very sometimes difficult in execution. But again, I think this is kind of the 80 20 of making that successful transition cool. So let's touch on some of the key focus areas.
00:13:33.820 - 00:15:03.836, Speaker A: I think as you think about the key focus areas as you make this transition, there are some things that I think are the ones that stick out to us certainly are. Team. Are you the right founders? What have you built before? Do you have complementary skill sets? Market what is needed in the market and will your product matter in this market? What are the pain points of your users in this market? Do you understand the market that you're building this product in? Technical, can you execute? Can you build? Can you get traction and build a community? Who are you building for? Will anybody care? Can you build in public openly? And can you use your community to bring people along on this road that you're on? Moat can you build a sustainable moat? Can you figure out an unfair competitive advantage and really protect your idea whether that's IP or technical talent or a unique business model? And there's just so many interesting unique business models that we can apply to startups within the web3 space. And then lastly, funding. How do you fund, sustain your project and what types of funding are best suited for your project? So let's touch on these individually. First, team, as you transition from project to startup, I think the founding team is a crucial key to success. You can have a perfect product in a perfect market and can still fail with an imperfect team.
00:15:03.836 - 00:15:55.096, Speaker A: I think team is really one of the big components that you want to get right. A great team can really overcome fits and starts and make multiple pivots even when the first idea doesn't quite work. So does the founding team include all the critical skills that your business is going to need? If not, how do you go about getting them? We get a lot of questions also about solo founders versus teams. I think as we've kind of analyzed successful teams in the past, single founders may not cover all the critical skills and subjects that a full team can. So can you go it alone? You can. Most likely it's not going to work. And so are you the type of founder that can build a team and build a team that has complementary skill sets.
00:15:55.096 - 00:17:03.220, Speaker A: I think the other really important thing with team and for those of you who have built startups in the past, you know this founding teams are subject to interpersonal problems and require effective governance. That's why I think things like Hack FS hackathons are really great because it allows teams to kind of get in the trenches, get into stressful environments and really become battle tested and have those relationships really kind of stand the test of time. I think when you're building a startup you are essentially saying that you're going to build with these people, with these individuals over the next 7578 years. And so your ability to have battle tested relationships I think is really critical. This for us is just kind of the anatomy of a rockstar founder right there's, what we would call founder market fit. You've got the relevant experience and unique insights. You've got a unique insight around the space that you are building in that others just don't or that's very hard to copy.
00:17:03.220 - 00:17:42.288, Speaker A: Second is leadership. You have the ability to inspire others to kind of follow along with your view of the world or your vision of what you're trying to build. And then lastly, hustle. I mean building a startup as you make the transition from hackathon project to startup endeavor, it's fucking hard, there's no other way to put it. And your ability to hustle and build like crazy and make really fast turns, learn from your customers really fast and then execute or build based on what you learn I think is just really important. Cool. Let's talk a little bit about the market.
00:17:42.288 - 00:19:20.832, Speaker A: As you start to think about the transition from hackathon project to whether this is sustainable business, you want to better understand your market and the users in that market, what are their key pain points? So a lot of times when you start off with a hackathon project and there are a number of really great projects that have successfully made that transition, there are a number that I can think of over the years. But eventually every founder or every team needs to start thinking about not what that initial instinct was or that idea was that they had when it was a hackathon project. What are the customers within this market clamoring for, what do they need, what are their pain points? What assumptions are you making about the users in this market and how can you quickly validate them? How big is this market? The size of this market I think really matters as you start thinking about understanding whether this is going to be a project that you just tinker on because you enjoy it and you really like the technology and it's just really interesting to you. Or maybe this is a nice lifestyle business or whether you should start thinking seriously about raising money for your idea because this is a really big market with a lot of potential users who have some real pain points. So these are just some of the questions that you want to start asking yourself as you start addressing the market technical. I would venture to guess that especially within the ETH global community, this is not a problem. In fact, this is usually the problem that this is usually not a problem.
00:19:20.832 - 00:20:30.452, Speaker A: As founders come through the Tachyandora, we spend a lot more time focusing on the other aspects of a startup. But the fact of the matter is the world is just full of smart, motivated people who just can't execute and build. And so your ability to do so, I think is really important. Depending on your audience and your objective and the level of complexity of your idea, your MVP, your minimum viable product, will range from low fidelity builds. You could implement things like no code, bubble solutions or dynamic UX designs, at least on the front end if you're using something like Figma and just kind of sweep all the blockchain stuff under the carpet all the way up to high fidelity MVPs, that really require you to write a lot more code. I think a lot of the projects that we see that come out of hackathons, you can and should be writing code if you can. But once you start transitioning from project to startup, and especially startups that raise money, precede money or seed money, you need to have a strong understanding of the users and your market before you start writing code.
00:20:30.452 - 00:21:58.800, Speaker A: And so a lot of the times we'll have very technical founders that will come through the door as a part of Tachyon and they immediately want to start writing code and we really want to pause them and go, what do you really understand about the customers in this market? What do you really understand about the market? Let's launch some low fidelity solutions so that we can really tease out some of those assumptions before we start incurring all this dev debt. And I think that's really important, especially in the Web Three space, especially if you're doing something like around DFI, where you start needing things like security audits, which are both lengthy and expensive processes. You could burn through a lot of time and a lot of capital unless you have a really strong understanding of your market and the users in your market. So really important traction and community, I think it's especially in the Web Three space, being able to build a community and build out in public. Again, I touched on this already, so I'm not going to belabor this point, but I will just say that the difference between a project and a startup is a customer. Literally everything you do from building a team, to executing a product roadmap, to raising money, to going through the legal loopholes of having to the legal transition that you need to make, to setting up a Delaware c Corp. It is all in the name of serving users and serving your community.
00:21:58.800 - 00:23:06.440, Speaker A: And the best founders in Web Three that we found are ones that build in public openly and harness their community as they validate ideas and then bring those users and bring that community along for the ride. We've got some great mentors as a part of Tachyon who have done a lot within the open source space and being able to transition from open source to understanding where the value accrues and where startups can capture some of that value if you're building within the open source space. But I think really being able to build a community and harness that community is really just a massive, massive differentiator. And I would just encourage all of you to openly build in public. So obviously you've got your GitHub repositories and so people can see your code. But building communities within, whether it's Telegram or Discord or Twitter or really good founders are ones, in my opinion, that are also good writers. They can take their ideas and write publicly.
00:23:06.440 - 00:24:35.590, Speaker A: So Medium is a great platform, I think, for startups who are building out in public, who want to build their communities. But whatever your thing is, figuring out what your medium is, I would just please strongly encourage you, as you start making this transition, to think about how you build out in the open, how you build in the public and build a community. It'll really be a valuable asset for your startup. Cool I'm going to skip this slide because I want to save enough time for Q and A. Mo. It's all about whether or not you can sustain your competitive advantage. How many people in the world can copy what you're doing? None? A few thousands? Do you, as a founder or as a founding team, have a unique insight in the space that you're building around? Have you not only tapped the subject matter experts in your space, but do you have a unique insight that gives you an unfair competitive advantage? And the question I always ask our companies when we start kind of poking around the sustainability of their moat is if I give you a six month head start and then spend millions of dollars to come after you with a stronger, better, faster, cheaper alternative, how is it that you're going to fend me off? And so starting to think about the moat that you can build for your idea, for your project and the defensibility of that mode, I think is just really important.
00:24:35.590 - 00:25:28.004, Speaker A: Cool and then lastly, funding. I'm sure all of you are very passionate about what you're building, and I totally get it. And so as you come out of something like Hack FS, the question becomes, how do I sustain this? I want to keep building this. So how do you sustain your project and what types of funding are really best suited for your project? I think that there are just a lot of options, a lot of funding options for startups, especially Web Three startups. There are just a number of grants programs out there. So starting to think about is this something that we can sustain via grants, and is that the best next step for what we're building and for our team? If you're building in the D Five space, obviously there are things like token economic models that you can start thinking about. I would strongly encourage you to think about the distribution model.
00:25:28.004 - 00:26:30.520, Speaker A: I think that's really important if you're thinking about going down that track, but that's something that's available to you. And again, I'm going to harp on it again, I promise I wouldn't, but if you've got a strong community, that becomes a lot easier. Third option is can you generate revenue from the project day one and get to what we might call Ramen profitability? It's funny, I feel like I have this debate with founders, with some of our alumni. Every couple of months there's almost this hesitation to talk about the word revenue. I think within the stripe community, but especially the Web Three community, and I think that's the wrong approach. I think if you have a project, if you can figure out how to accrue value and capture some of that value and be a revenue generating project from day one, it just gives you more optionality. And so again, we really want to see founders continue on with their projects.
00:26:30.520 - 00:27:27.470, Speaker A: And so I think it's a viable option and I think it's one that more Web Three startup founders should think about. And then lastly, obviously, if your project is a venture size scale startup, there are a number of options, a number of routes that you can go. There are angels, there are accelerators, there are incubators, there are microseed funds, there are pre seed funds all the way up to seed and Series A funds. Most projects I think within this stage will probably for their friends and family. I didn't bring that up, but that's another option. I think most projects at this stage are probably Greek candidates for angels, accelerators, incubators, and maybe microseed funds. And so that's definitely an option, especially as you start answering some of the questions that we just went through within whether or not this is a scalable project for you.
00:27:27.470 - 00:28:12.504, Speaker A: Oh cool. If you are looking to make the jump over to turning this project of yours as a part of Hack FS into a full time startup, we'd love to meet you, we'd love to talk to you. We're actually doing virtual office hours over the next couple of weeks. You can go to in my I'll share this in the chat and I don't know if Trent or Emily if you guys can share the website, it's Labs Consensus net Tachyon, you can find out more information about the program. Again, applications are currently live and close on August 21. There's an option to book 15 minutes virtual office hours with us. We'd love to meet you.
00:28:12.504 - 00:29:12.796, Speaker A: We'd love to talk to you. And then as a sponsor of Hackfs Hackathon winning teams are guaranteed an interview as a part of their application to filecoin launchpad accelerator. So I was talking with Jacob yesterday, taking a look at some of the projects that have already been submitted and just really impressed with what all of you are building and what you're up to. And we're all really excited, I think I get excited thinking about what's next for the web Three ecosystem. And distributed storage is just something that I think is really important. I think the Ethereum community and the IPFS filecoin community, I start getting really excited about thinking about the possibilities when you start thinking about things like distributed storage, communicating directly with smart contracts and what kind of new business models that opens up. It's the Wild West right now.
00:29:12.796 - 00:29:31.830, Speaker A: It's an early frontier. But I'm really excited to see what everybody is building. And so with that, I think, yeah, I really want to leave enough time for Q A, so I'm going to stop sharing my screen for 1 second. There we go. Can you guys see me okay?
00:29:33.240 - 00:29:33.748, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:33.834 - 00:29:34.228, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:29:34.314 - 00:29:34.660, Speaker B: Great.
00:29:34.730 - 00:29:34.964, Speaker A: Cool.
00:29:35.002 - 00:29:54.200, Speaker B: Thanks, gabriel, that was great. I know one or two questions came in on the Chat channel from Mustafa. I don't know if you can see the questions or if you'd like me to read it out quickly. Oh, I think you muted, Gabriel.
00:29:55.980 - 00:30:06.270, Speaker A: There you mustafa, can you I'm going through Chat and I'm not seeing Mustafa's question.
00:30:08.320 - 00:30:15.820, Speaker B: Do you take equity in the companies you invest in and do you accept solo founders?
00:30:17.760 - 00:31:02.750, Speaker A: Yes, we will work with solo founders and then, yes, we do take equity. Again, we are usually the first check into a company, so it's 80K for 7%. The good thing about this program is because of the consensus and protocol ops partnership is you actually get both companies on your cap table for the same 7%. And so again, for those of you that have built startups before, as you start thinking about raising money, coming out of an accelerated program, having two really strong companies on your cap table like that, I think really strengthens your fundraising. So, yes, to answer the question, we make an investment in your company. $80,000 for 7% between the two companies.
00:31:06.480 - 00:31:13.200, Speaker B: Great. Mustafa, I hope that answered your question. You're welcome to unmute yourself. Okay.
00:31:13.270 - 00:31:13.776, Speaker A: You're welcome.
00:31:13.878 - 00:31:25.604, Speaker B: Thanks. Cool. Does anyone want to unmute themselves and ask Gabriel some questions? Please feel free. Don't be shy while we wait.
00:31:25.642 - 00:32:01.808, Speaker A: I'm just going to drop in. We have an FAQ on the website as well, but I'm just going to drop it in of we've gotten a ton of questions, obviously, over the years. So if you're shy, I can probably guess what some of your questions would be. I'd be surprised if we didn't address at least some of them. Within this FAQ doc. But yeah, if I can answer any questions or if you want to talk about your project a little bit yeah, I'm here to help out any way that makes the most sense. Yeah.
00:32:01.894 - 00:32:17.284, Speaker C: I had a question, Josh, for the timeline, it's going to be basically this entire fall until January, right? And it's expected that your project would be full time throughout that period, is that right?
00:32:17.402 - 00:32:19.270, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right, yeah.
00:32:20.920 - 00:32:34.344, Speaker C: If we have jobs or other obligations, how are we enabled to put those on hold? I could potentially do that, but at the same time then bills still need to get paid. How does that work?
00:32:34.462 - 00:33:38.610, Speaker A: Yeah, completely understand. So obviously we're making an investment of you can use that capital for a number of purposes, including your living expenses, but I think attacking an accelerator is really for people who want this to be their full time project. And so, yes, you would go through the fall, it culminates in a demo day. As a part of that demo day, we bring investors who will listen to your pitch, listen, take a look at your project. A number of our companies raise their follow on round, usually a seed size round, and somebody stopped me if I'm getting too much into VC lingo, but a number of our teams end up raising their next round as a part of their demo day or coming out of their demo day. So really this is for projects making the transition into full time. This is their startup, this is their baby, this is the thing they want to be committed to for the next 5678 years.
00:33:38.610 - 00:33:41.280, Speaker A: And so that initial investment.
00:33:41.700 - 00:33:47.824, Speaker C: So that 80K is for this program that lasts through it's not for after.
00:33:47.942 - 00:34:23.820, Speaker A: Potentially, yeah, no, we are making an investment in your company. We fully expect that this will take care of a portion of your living expenses, any operating expenses. Obviously you want to be very frugal with your burn so that you can extend your runway, but yeah, this ADK is an investment for teams that includes a portion of your living expenses. As you really start hacking on this and trying to turn this into a really venture sized startup.
00:34:26.320 - 00:34:35.360, Speaker C: I have one more. So I have never had a startup, but what is the difference between a regular startup and a venture sized startup?
00:34:36.500 - 00:35:52.280, Speaker A: That's a great question. I think the biggest differentiator so I'm an entrepreneur and I think the word startup gets thrown around quite a bit. I've built all kinds of businesses, I've built consulting businesses, I've built fintech technology companies, I've built prop tech companies which are just basically real estate software companies, I've built media companies, I've built consulting companies. I think the biggest differentiator between a venture backed or venture sized startup versus just any old like me and a couple of buddies are going to go start a consulting business is you're really competing in a market where you can get significant size and scale, where you think your project can grow to affect or get users in tens of thousands. Really, we start thinking about in the Web Three space, what's the potential market size within blockchain within Web Three? So tens of thousands of users or a very sizable market that you're building in that can hit a lot of scale, a lot of growth.
00:35:53.580 - 00:35:56.188, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, that answers my questions. Thanks.
00:35:56.354 - 00:36:17.330, Speaker A: Cool. Great to meet you. Veronica asked a question. It sounds like you're targeting protocol level projects that are tools for other projects. Do you sponsor projects that are more customer facing? Yeah, that's a great question. So if you go to the website labs consensus net slash tachyon. We actually have three.
00:36:17.330 - 00:37:14.708, Speaker A: See, the way that we thought about this program is, again, whether you're building on top of IPFS and Filecoin or you think that you can build on top of IPFS and Filecoin. I think, Veronica, what we're really looking for is we've thought about in verticals, we've thought about the infrastructure layer. We've thought about the middleware layer, and then we've thought about the application layer, and we want to see teams and projects in all three. So that core infrastructure layer is really about developer tools that support encryption, file management and retrieval, basic onboarding, things like that. For us, the middleware layer are platforms that really shape the integration and usage of IPFS into other applications. So things that are more like plug and play with DApps or DeFi toolkits or data analytics tools on top of IPFS and Filecoin. And then that third layer, the third layer of the onion, if you will, is kind of that application layer, which is, I think, what you're referring to.
00:37:14.708 - 00:37:59.740, Speaker A: And we would love to see tools that are utilizing IPFS or Filecoin as part of their core tech stack for end user applications. So things like file sharing or archival tools or various DApps. We've even heard about a couple of companies that are doing some really interesting stuff with DeFi and IPFS integrations, which I think is really interesting and really cool. So, yeah, I'm really glad you asked that question. I would love to see companies that are building at all three because I think all three are really important, especially within this really early Nascent community. You're welcome. Good to meet you as well.
00:37:59.740 - 00:39:09.780, Speaker A: Just going through here, what do you think is most needed in the decentralized Web? Great question, Jay. I don't know if this is the answer that you're looking for, but I think a lot more focus on users and traction and growth. I think in Web Three, we tend to think that we're just very different than Web Two, and I think there are a lot of great principles that we can pull from Web Two. But I think one of the most important ones is starting with focusing on users. A lot of times we'll see a team of just like really smart technical people or engineers, but they haven't done the really difficult work of understanding users. And what are those pain points and how can we use technology to alleviate some of those pain points, which is, I think, key and crucial to growth. So probably more of a 30,000 foot view answer to your question than maybe what you're looking for.
00:39:09.780 - 00:40:14.882, Speaker A: I think if we want to get more into key components of the stack, I think onboarding and user friction, especially on the UX UI side, as far as onboarding into Web Three is still very difficult. We have a great company that came out of Tech on Three called Transact, which I think is really making a strong push into that space. But I want to see more users in this ecosystem, probably just like you, and that's still a big need, I think, within the Web Three ecosystem. Cool. Just looking through comments here, emily, help me if I missed some of these, but I see one from Satoshi here. What if my project competes with one of Consensus's core products, product offerings, like infuria Benefit, the wider Ethereum file coin blockchain ecosystem? Satoshi, I would love to know what you're building. And yeah, 100%, if what you're building is needed, if it's a good idea, if you have the ability to execute.
00:40:14.882 - 00:40:34.460, Speaker A: I don't care if you're competing against Consensus. Yeah, it's completely fine with us. Oh, Josh. Yeah. Here, let me drop them in. I'll drop them in chat. Here Transact right there.
00:40:36.690 - 00:40:37.774, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:40:37.972 - 00:41:38.066, Speaker A: You're welcome. Gravin. Hopefully I pronounced your name correctly. As an investor, how do you think about the tension of building a business model versus maintaining trust of the community if a company is trying to build public good infrastructure? That is a great question. I think both are needed, and I really challenge teams to not think of it as either or. Again, like, Robert Droust, who's a part of Consensus, heads up our R D, and John Purcell is actually another one within the Consensus ecosystem. I've had a number of conversations with them around companies that have made the pivot from open source to figuring out how they can add additional features or benefits to the core product to figure out where that value is going to accrue as they start thinking about the transition to business model.
00:41:38.066 - 00:42:44.840, Speaker A: I know that's not a direct answer to your question, but it's definitely a tension, and I think it's an important tension. But I really do try to challenge companies to think about how do you sustain yourself? Right. And so having a business model where you can capture a portion of the value, I think it's important to leave a lot of the value on the table for the community, especially if you're utilizing that community, especially if you're open source. Right. But especially if you're utilizing that community to assist you in growing and getting size and scale you can and should use or leave a good amount of that value on the table for the community. But you've got to sustain yourself, and I think especially if you're building something that is key or important for the ecosystem, it would be unfortunate if you were no longer around, if your project was no longer around, and that community really depended on it. So figuring out how you sustain yourself, I think, is really important.
00:42:44.840 - 00:43:45.660, Speaker A: That really depends on what you're building and what the potential business model is. But I think Web Three is starting to open up some really interesting and unique business models that just didn't exist before. I was reading an article this morning from Dragonfly Research on the uniqueness of uniswap. We've had many conversations with Hayden and that team, but thinking about how that company came about and really changed Morphed into this decentralized exchange. I think their first product was, like, 300 lines of code and how they build that incentive mechanism for LPs who want to be liquidity providers and add to those pools. They've figured out a business model in order to sustain themselves, and I think that's really important. Web Three companies need to think about that again, especially if you're building something that is important that the community relies on.
00:43:45.660 - 00:44:03.520, Speaker A: Yeah. How does he not make money? We can touch on that, I think, maybe a little bit later. I want to keep our Q A focused for right now, Alex, but if you want to email me, happy to have that conversation with you.
00:44:08.230 - 00:44:12.690, Speaker B: Yeah. Gabriel, I think there was a message from Nazarino.
00:44:14.470 - 00:44:22.680, Speaker A: Oh, Nazarino. Nazarino, did I talk to you yesterday as a part of the kernel community?
00:44:24.170 - 00:44:25.830, Speaker D: I'm also in kernel.
00:44:28.250 - 00:44:58.000, Speaker A: Okay. Good to see you again. Good to talk to you again. Me and Christian are building wrapped file coin and a file coin in a mess like wallet. Do you think this will be a good I love the pitch in the chat. I love the hustle. I would have to know a little bit more about the project, but at first blush, yeah, I think it would be super interesting.
00:44:58.000 - 00:45:22.462, Speaker A: I'd love to hear more. I'd love to see an application from you guys and learn a little bit more about the project and what you're building. Oh, Veronica, there are a few of us in both of kernel and hackfs. All right, well, I love it. Durin. Well, you guys have already seen this presentation, then, but welcome back. Let me just go through the chats.
00:45:22.462 - 00:45:26.940, Speaker A: Bitcoin 2.0. Satoshi, I think I answered this question.
00:45:28.270 - 00:45:31.420, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think you've missed any so far.
00:45:31.790 - 00:45:32.540, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:45:32.910 - 00:45:37.610, Speaker B: But if anyone would like to unmute and ask a question that's also a possibility.
00:45:38.590 - 00:46:14.230, Speaker A: Cool. Alex, I think I looked at your project this morning. Yeah. The team from Ukraine. I know this isn't a question, but since you guys are from Ukraine, obviously, filecoin launchpad accelerator is global in nature, so we would love to see teams from all over the world apply. I'm really excited to see what various teams come up with. Ex Consensus employees are welcome to Tachyon.
00:46:14.230 - 00:46:42.900, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, 100%. We do not discriminate. We are supporters of the ecosystem. We are supporters of really amazing projects. So if you have something that you're building, Satoshi, that's really interesting, that we really believe in and think is important, that we'd love to put skin in the game and by investing in your company, I don't care who you used to work for, I'd love to talk to you and I'd love to see your project.
00:46:44.870 - 00:46:46.500, Speaker D: I would like to ask about.
00:46:48.470 - 00:46:48.930, Speaker A: Business.
00:46:49.000 - 00:48:07.200, Speaker D: Models for dubs, for blockchains, et cetera. So far I cannot see that there are any successful business models except like you are building a blockchain and you are issuing tokens and buy our tokens and then you make even X two and everyone is happy even X two. But other business models like convenient business models like where you cut the percentage of transactions, transaction fee and advertisements I cannot imagine that it works because if there is a successful project from technical point of view and anybody can launch especially if there are companies with huge market amounts of money they can take this successfully working technical product and they can hire very good team of experts and they will learn everything in three months easily and they can put in advertisement huge amount of money. How we can compete with this? How can you put this transaction fee cutting transaction? It will not work. So even today, DeFi project started to take zero fee. So just use our product and we will be you for this, no problem. We don't take anything.
00:48:07.650 - 00:48:57.040, Speaker A: Yeah, so you raised a really good point, Trent. Thank you, by the way, for dropping this in. I haven't seen this GitHub repo in probably a year and a half. This is a Ko classic. The various business models around Web Three. I think, Alex, you're raising a good point. I would say as somebody who's built a number of startups within the you know, who, who now is very passionate about, know, evolve and grow and grow up a little bit, I don't think we've explored all the various business models and in fact, I think there are even more business models available to us.
00:48:57.040 - 00:50:14.338, Speaker A: I've been having this conversation with more and more people over the last couple of months. It really started with Jesse Walden, who for those of you that don't know, he launched a 16 z's crypto startup school and now has a small fund as he's starting to invest in early stage Web Three companies. And he and I both are really passionate around what's kind of been dubbed the passion economy in the last company that I built is a digital media business. We scaled it up to hundreds of millions of maus monthly active users and we did a lot within the influencer marketing space. This is a perfect example. As you start thinking about these platforms that get built, you have influencer marketers that start coming along who can incentivize their community via things like micro payments to participate in their success as they start to grow and scale. We haven't really tapped into and these are things that just become available via not just DeFi protocols, but where code is really kind of managing the transactions as opposed to human interactions.
00:50:14.338 - 00:50:56.686, Speaker A: And we really haven't explored all of these business models. I think what we're going to see is just this Cambrian Explosion, especially as E 20 starts to come online, just this Cambrian Explosion of new business models. I think a lot of them will be derivatives from the Web Two ecosystem that we will start to take and repurpose and plug into some of the code. I would agree with you. There has not been a massive explosion of new business models yet, but I think they're coming. I'm very bullish on this. And Trent, thank you again for dropping in this GitHub repo.
00:50:56.686 - 00:51:37.520, Speaker A: I think a number of people got a dev. Was was this DevCon like two years ago or something like that, where the business model Rings Group got together and started archetyping all these really cool potential business models that Web Three could adapt? Yeah, I just think that there are so many new and interesting business models that can and will come online. We're just going to have to keep building and be a little patient because they are on their way. But I think we're getting really close, actually. I know that wasn't a direct answer to your question. I apologize. I kind of sidestepped it.
00:51:40.530 - 00:52:07.850, Speaker D: I saw the surposter and read through it, and it's interesting. But the biggest issue here right now is that Dubs and Blockchains appreciate open source, and once everything is open source, and especially its license allows to have a private modifications, et cetera, how can you protect, especially in some crazy countries like Eastern Europe.
00:52:10.670 - 00:52:55.446, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So making the transition from open source to value capture is an art and a science in and of itself. Again, we've got a couple of people within the consensus network that have done a lot within that space. I'm definitely not an expert in how open source projects start to make that transition. I would probably introduce you to a couple of people within the consensus network who've done it and spent a lot of time thinking about it, especially as you start thinking about the various open source licenses that exist.
00:52:55.446 - 00:53:50.634, Speaker A: I think there's a way to navigate it, but there is a way to navigate it, and I'm trying to think of a really good example of a project that came out that was open source, that came out of a hackathon and made the pivot into one of the teams that we funded. God, I'm drawing a blank on who would be a good example. Actually, here I'll give you a project right now. So in our last batch, Idle Finance started out as an open source project. They're an interest rate optimization DeFi company. If I'm not mistaken, they were one of the winners of one of the ETH Global hackathon events maybe a year ago. It was not East Denver, I can't remember which one it was.
00:53:50.634 - 00:54:34.570, Speaker A: But they started out as an open source project before they turned Idle into their full time startup. They changed the business model a little bit. They changed the product a little bit and made that transition. So it's definitely doable. I'm certainly not an expert in that arena. And again, depending on the nature of your company, there are a number of ways that you need to make that pivot, especially depending on the open source license that you begin with. But I would definitely steer you into somebody like a Robert Droust who heads up R D within Consensus or somebody like that who has a lot of expertise around the open source to value capture transition.
00:54:34.570 - 00:55:08.370, Speaker A: Satoshi great point. Tarun, let me get to your question. What parameters do you think to consider to understand the timing of your product is right or not? That's a great question, Tarun. Hopefully I'm pronouncing your name correctly. I apologize if I'm not. The most important parameter, I think, is whether or not you're getting traction. And there's a lot of ways that you can get that signal.
00:55:08.370 - 00:56:02.674, Speaker A: Again, when you're in an environment like hack FS, you're doing a lot of hacking, you're doing a lot of building, a lot of heads down. Maybe you're writing code and so you're really focused on product. But as you start to pop your head up a little bit, I think you want to spend a little bit more time within who are you building this product for? And if you can get any signal around what you've built as far as demand from users and there's a lot of ways that you can go about doing that. We spend a lot of time with projects within Tachyon thinking about that. But again, that goes back to can you build a community, can you build an open there's a number of different platforms that you can use to try to get market signal, but I think that's probably the most important one. Great point. Trent yeah, thank you for that from Satoshi.
00:56:02.674 - 00:56:58.860, Speaker A: On the open source point, is there a license requirement, like, only accept Apache 2.0? No license requirements. Satoshi scrolling through here, I should actually find Idol's original GitHub repo so you guys could see because they started out as an open source project. Great team. There's another one, actually, that we looked at that we didn't end up investing in called Afogato. I think they were building a stablecoin around coffee beans to help protect coffee bean farmers in Lad Am. I know they started out as an open source project before they made the pivot to trying to build a business model, which I believe is a transaction fee, if I remember correctly.
00:56:58.860 - 00:57:25.350, Speaker A: But that was a really interesting team. They were very passionate about coffee and protecting coffee farmers. Several members of the team came out of that industry. So that's another one that probably point you guys to. I know they were at East Denver this year because I was there and I saw them. Cool. Trent, Emily, how are we doing on time? I think we've got one more minute, right? Maybe one more question if somebody has one.
00:57:27.980 - 00:57:35.720, Speaker B: Yeah. Not sure if anybody wants to have the last question. Gabriel?
00:57:42.010 - 00:58:27.510, Speaker A: Eufirm. Are it? I think that was a shout out. Thank you, UVAS, if I pronounce that correctly. If not, maybe I just got digged and I don't know. It awesome. Well, I would just say I'm super excited about the projects that I've been seeing within the Hack FS community. We've obviously been partners and big supporters of the ETH Global team for a while, and I just know they always bring out the best projects and the best hackers and the best builders, and I'm really excited about thinking about the possibilities between the Ethereum and IPFS filecoin communities.
00:58:27.510 - 00:58:57.810, Speaker A: And so, again, if you're interested in learning more about Tachyon, I'll just drop it in the chat here one more time. You can visit us at labs consensus. Net slash tachyon. You can learn a little bit more about the program. There's an FAQ on there. We are doing virtual office hours as well. So if you want to book a 15 minutes slot with the team, with a member of the team and just talk a little bit more, maybe learn a little bit more about the program or talk about your project, however you want to spend that time, we would love to meet all of you.
00:58:57.810 - 00:59:23.386, Speaker A: You. Yeah. Satoshi, you can go to the website. There's a link to our let me just grab it right now. Copy link address. There's a link on the website where you can where'd my chat window go? There's a link on the website where you can book a 15 minutes slot with a member of our team. Thank you.
00:59:23.386 - 00:59:50.526, Speaker A: Josh. Yeah. We'd love to meet you. And again, even if you're not quite sure, but you really are passionate about your project and you want to try to make that transition from a hackathon project to having this be your full time endeavor, we'd love to see you apply. I'd love to meet your team. We'll be going through applications over the next couple of weeks. We'll be setting up interviews with teams that we want to progress through the process.
00:59:50.526 - 01:00:18.140, Speaker A: Working closely with the Protocol Labs team, you'll have access to the Consensus network, you'll have access to the Protocol Labs network. And so we would just love to learn more about you and your startup and what you're building. We're just really excited. So I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you guys today. If I can answer anything for you, definitely book a virtual office hours with us and we'll spend 15 minutes with you to talk a little bit more.
01:00:20.430 - 01:01:05.258, Speaker B: Thanks so much, Gabriel. If anybody wants to reach him, you can just ping him on the Consensus Tachyon sponsor channel. I'm sure that's perfectly fine. And, yeah, just before everybody goes, just one last reminder about submissions due this Thursday, 1 minute to midnight, 6 August. And if any of you would like feedback on your videos, who can't make the demo session today at 430 Eastern? Send it to any ETH Global team member and we're more than happy to have a look at it. But, yeah, we do have that last demo session at 430 today Eastern. Looking forward to seeing you guys there.
01:01:05.258 - 01:01:07.420, Speaker B: Great. Thanks, everyone.
01:01:08.670 - 01:01:10.710, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone. Bye.
