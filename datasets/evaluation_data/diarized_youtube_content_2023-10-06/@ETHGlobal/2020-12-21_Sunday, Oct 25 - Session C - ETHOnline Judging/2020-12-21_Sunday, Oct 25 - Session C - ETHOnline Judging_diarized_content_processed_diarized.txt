00:00:00.410 - 00:01:00.910, Speaker A: Welcome to day two of judging for ETH Online. Kind of the the amazing thing about this event is that we had over 710 hackers from 65 different countries spending 19 different time zones participate over the last few weeks. And last Thursday, which is about three days ago, we had the submission deadline and we got 175 projects through the event. And what we're doing over the next couple of days is going through a lot of these projects on these demos and recording these and kind of walking through all the demos so we can highlight some of our favorite ones this coming Friday, October the 30th in our finale. So before we kind of jump into how this call is structured and the demos themselves, I want to just go over the judging format. So each team here will have eight minutes in total for their demos. They'll have four minutes to go over their videos, and then there'll be a four minute section for Q and A from our judges.
00:01:00.910 - 00:01:54.400, Speaker A: And kind of just to make sure that we give everybody a break as there are a lot of projects, we'll do a quick break halfway through our demos in terms of kind of how the judges will be scoring these projects. They will be scored on how technical, original, and practical a project is, along with the design aspects of their demo, whether that's a web app or a developer tool. And then we also recognize that not all categories are fair for every team. And there are going to be different ways to look at different projects and different members. We also have a catch all for a callball factor that helps us sort of offset anything that we may have missed from the four categories above. So before we go into our demos, I want to just make sure I emphasize that this is not a competition. The goal for ETH Online and ETH Global in general is to do events and encourage people to learn.
00:01:54.400 - 00:02:23.094, Speaker A: And there are no expectations or goals for people to become businesses. So they are very much interested in learning and experimentation. And the hackers are here currently to get feedback. And this is kind of the perspective our judges will be taking to. And speaking of that, the three people that will be helping us today are going to be Justin from Grid, plus we have Barney from Vega Protocol and Ashley from Uniswap. So I want to welcome all three of them here. And with that, let's go jump into the demos directly.
00:02:23.094 - 00:02:37.760, Speaker A: So we have our first team already ready, and Amishek, I believe, is here. So you are kind of free to kick us off with your demo and we'll jump right into the first demo for today.
00:02:40.610 - 00:02:41.162, Speaker B: Sweet.
00:02:41.226 - 00:02:44.740, Speaker C: Thank you. Let me just share my screen real quick.
00:03:00.070 - 00:03:43.278, Speaker B: My name is Abhishek and this is Nifty Crates. So what is a nifty crate? A Nifty Crate is a container for your NFTs that could serve as a loot box. And this is nifty crates. So what is a nifty crate? A nifty crate is a container for your NFTs that could serve as a loot box. It's ERC, 721 compliant. So you can trade it, basically, you can open the crate to get a prize or you can buy an entire crate outright and the owner of the crate can set up all the prices, this content, the settings, everything about the crate. So the problem we're solving is that usually people have a lot of NFTs that are very common, hard to sell, and only a few that are valuable.
00:03:43.278 - 00:04:28.878, Speaker B: And people want to liquidate their tokens for as much ETH as possible. So combining multiple tokens and using the randomized nature of loot boxes can encourage multiple purchases and help people maximize their profit. So how it works is you buy a nifty crate and you put some NFTs into the crate. Then you can set the ranking for each of those NFTs to determine the drawing ODS and configure the price to open the crate. And then others can come and spend gems on your crate and you earn the money. So why is this important? Well, it lets whales compose their tokens in order to increase their profits, which is something that's very important for the community. It also reduces the amortized cost of transferring large collections of NFTs.
00:04:28.878 - 00:05:10.160, Speaker B: And finally, we can defeat unfair regulations against loot boxes and game mechanics through censorship resisted program. So, let's go over to the demo. So here what we have is we see a couple of crates that are available for buying. This one has eight items in it, this one has four items in it, and this one is a little more expensive to open, but it seems like it has better stuff in it. So let's check this one out. Let's go ahead and click on this guy. And here we can see sort of this cool rotating cube and we can see the different prizes that we could potentially get from within it.
00:05:10.160 - 00:05:40.980, Speaker B: And cool. I think I want this prize. So let's try to get this one. We're going to need to buy some gems first, so let's buy some gems and should be pretty quick. So we've got some ten gems now and we can use those to open the crate. Let's try to open the crate and see what we get. And we won this guy.
00:05:40.980 - 00:05:46.546, Speaker B: Just not very impressive, but we'll try again one more time.
00:05:46.568 - 00:05:47.140, Speaker C: Maybe.
00:05:52.920 - 00:06:42.148, Speaker B: We won this orange guy. I guess it's just not our day today. Well, anyway, back to the presentation. So the crate features are basically that it is ERC, 721 compatible. It also has sender access control that lets you control who can send items into the crate. And finally, you can configure custom opening logic so that with your own token, so that you can create fun new games, possibly, that are up to you. So what I accomplished in this hackathon, basically, I designed and wrote the smart contracts for this, for top down composable ERC 721, built it, tested it, deployed it to testnet, basically got basic testing completed and built the basic front end like you saw.
00:06:42.148 - 00:07:11.120, Speaker B: And the future work would be to more thoroughly audit the security, optimize gas, get feature complete on the client and deploy to the main net and finally add more pop to the game and work with the community to add more features, more different opener types, different games. So that's it. Thanks for listening to my presentation. That's Nifty creates by yeah, so that was the video.
00:07:11.270 - 00:07:22.450, Speaker D: Hello, everyone. My name is Ben Gervais. I work here at Braver Technology. Welcome to today's Webinar about cybersecurity. Thank you for joining us.
00:07:23.780 - 00:07:52.220, Speaker A: I'll just mute him in the meantime. Looks like another video started playing on your end. But yeah, thanks for that demo. It's a really cool concept. I'll kind of start this off and I'll just ask, sort of, have you kind of seen any other loopbox approach apply to NFTs? And I'm just curious because this is the first one I've seen. So I'm wondering how you sort of got to this idea. And after that, I'll let kind of actually Justin and Barney kick off with any questions and comments.
00:07:53.600 - 00:08:32.200, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry about that earlier audio. That was from the next YouTube video. That autoplayed. But yeah, thanks for the question. Basically, what sort of drove me to this was I was an early player and developer on CryptoKitties, and we built this thing called Kitty Hats, which was a bottom up composable, which you could attach a sticker to a CryptoKitty. But in this case, we were thinking of the reverse approach where you can put multiple different tokens inside of a box and then kind of finding an interesting use case for that. One thing that I saw with CryptoKitties, the early sort of magic was based around the fact that you could get something random out of an interesting sort of system.
00:08:32.200 - 00:09:23.210, Speaker C: And people found a lot of engagement around sort of figuring out how that system worked. And then my goal was to sort of replicate that same fun and that same sort of user experience where you get something out of a cool box or an egg with this project in a way that was generalized. That kind of took multiple games into account and then also sort of creating a way for different NFT game, like an entry point for different NFT games because people usually end up playing just one. And what I wanted people to do was try out multiple games, try out different games and have a fun and interesting way to kind of liquidate the tokens that they get from these games to other players to get them to try the other games. So that's kind of what the motivation was.
00:09:26.460 - 00:09:30.200, Speaker D: Awesome. Should we just hop in with our questions, comments kartik.
00:09:30.620 - 00:09:31.464, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:09:31.662 - 00:09:46.732, Speaker D: Okay, cool. Well, thank you so much for this. This is interesting. One of the things I was thinking of as you were presenting was it kind of reminds me of buying packs of Pokemon cards. Like, maybe there's a charizard in there. Right. That was obviously hugely successful.
00:09:46.732 - 00:10:05.700, Speaker D: So I guess I wasn't clear on I saw that you have to buy gems in order to open something. So what are gems and what is the feature around opening it? You can basically see what's in there beforehand, so it's not actually like you're buying a mysterious box of goodies.
00:10:07.340 - 00:10:50.244, Speaker C: That's right. So it's not a blind loot box in the sense that you can actually see inside of what's inside of it. And what you know is what are the ODS of hitting each item, but you don't know which one you'll get, obviously. And the gems are sort of this mechanic that I've created because in order to keep it fair and prevent front runners, what you need to do is ensure that there's sort of a two phase commit process, which was sort of the same thing as in the CryptoKitties world. It was, oh, you sort of breed these two kitties. That was the first phase of the commit, and then somebody else would come and open or birth the kitty, and that was the second phase of the commit. In this case, each gem is sort of like a nonce, right.
00:10:50.244 - 00:11:06.730, Speaker C: So you can generate a bunch of nonces for yourself, and then those are yours, and then you can use those to open a crate each time and you'll sort of get something out of the crate. So that's kind of like a security measure wrapped in a sort of fun game mechanic language to help people understand the game.
00:11:07.580 - 00:11:08.184, Speaker E: Very cool.
00:11:08.222 - 00:11:09.610, Speaker C: Does that kind of answer your question?
00:11:09.980 - 00:11:11.050, Speaker D: Yeah. Thanks.
00:11:11.500 - 00:11:24.080, Speaker E: Cool. What question I had was you mentioned kind of custom crate opening logic, which sounds quite interesting to me. Like, what sort of ideas do you have for using that logic to kind of extend mechanic beyond, I guess, kind of more of a lottery.
00:11:25.220 - 00:11:25.680, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:25.750 - 00:12:20.460, Speaker C: So actually the first goal was for the custom crate opening logic was really so that I could upgrade it in case there was a problem and that the crate token itself would be upgradable to sort of help me fix any mistakes that I possibly made. But really what it lets you do is if you own a crate, you can sort of set a specific contract that will say, hey, this is how this crate will be opened. And basically that function has to return one of the tokens from within that crate and then that will be transferred to the winner. Right. And you can customize and modify that logic. So if tomorrow we figured out a way to sort of do it without the two phase commit, without using gems to do that, if there was a secure way to open the crate in a single step. That would be very ideal.
00:12:20.460 - 00:13:01.336, Speaker C: It would reduce one single transaction. So the first goal of that was to keep it open ended so we could extend it in the future or fix things in the future. And the second thing is that I can envision other people making interesting games where you have to do a series of steps before you're allowed to open a particular crate in a game. So that's kind of like a sort of engagement mechanic to help you guide you through the progression. That's just one example. But of course, you could pretty much write a smart contract for anything. So you could be like, hey, you can only open this crate if you own so and so amount of this other currency or other token.
00:13:01.336 - 00:13:03.230, Speaker C: Lots of different things are possible.
00:13:04.880 - 00:13:31.720, Speaker F: I just want to say I really like the idea, especially with high main net gas costs recently, sort of the idea that a lot of cool NFTs have sort of been orphaned or it's not worthwhile to pass them around. So I was also wondering on the back end, now that you already have this functionality for containerizing packs of NFTs, do you also see it being used as just like a way of managing those collections so people can easily organize and send without it being tedious?
00:13:33.420 - 00:14:11.664, Speaker C: Exactly. So one of the big improved things I found was especially with CryptoKitties, right? It's very hard to batch transfer things. And then if you batch transfer collections repeatedly, that gas cost is very high. So in this case, what you can do is compose them all up. And then if you expect this collection to stay together for a long time, you can use that sort of to drastically reduce your transfer cost. And that helps a lot. So there is, of course, some cost to composing them and there is some sort of minimum number of transactions that you need to do for the amortized cost to be cheaper.
00:14:11.664 - 00:14:31.390, Speaker C: But basically, you're absolutely right in that composing the tokens allows you to over time, drive down that cost drastically, especially for a lot of tokens that make sense to sell together. So if I have a huge collection of aquamarine cats and I just want to sell that to a person who has no aquamarine cats, that makes sense.
00:14:32.480 - 00:14:55.090, Speaker A: So we are at time. Thank you so much for being our first demo and telling us about nifty crates. And I hope you continue building this. So with that, we're ready to move on to our next team, and that is Project Digital Euro Stablecoin Protocol. So I know, Nino, you are on this call, so feel free to kick off with your demo and screen share.
00:14:56.020 - 00:14:56.930, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:15:00.500 - 00:15:37.116, Speaker H: For ETH Online 2020. Our project for ETH Online 2020 is to build the world's first Europed stablecoin. Today we are introducing D Euro, a one to one collateralized stablecoin that is pegged to euro Dai. It can be transferred freely and is always redeemable for an ever growing amount of Dai. Get ready for Dank the euro debanked. My name is Charles Steenser, I'm the project manager. My team consists of Nino Nomad as contract writer, Ben Ing as primary backend developer, Kurogi WashU as primary front end developer and Yazid as the web Three integration specialist.
00:15:37.116 - 00:16:30.064, Speaker H: The digital euro starts with a simple mintable ERC 20 smart contract and can escalate quickly into a monster that requires dozens of additional functions, interfaces and support structures and our random team of five developers. We decided on the first day of the hackathon that we need to set a clear realistic scope and a deployment to the coven testnet in order to deliver a working proof of concept by the 21 October. The digital euro should always keep its one to one peg to the current price of euro. Therefore, it is mandatory to have a few oracles. We used chainlink price feed Oracles to determine the target price with Daiusd and USD euro. To keep the scope realistic, we set Dai as the first acceptable collateral to mint de euro. The manager Sol got the owner's rights for the digital euro Seoul and acts as a constant primary market for de euro as well as interacting via web three with our DAP front end.
00:16:30.064 - 00:17:18.236, Speaker H: Like all other stablecoins, we realized early on that we require a secondary token that acts as a value support reserve and could be extended into other features later on. The digital bank Dank token is manually used to support stabilizing the Europeg for the proof of concept phase. To stabilize the peg, we rely on the constant primary market that always buys sells the euro for the current sport rate of one to €1 on the secondary markets. Like Uniswap, the price will fluctuate of course, providing arbitrage opportunities for any participant on the open market. Not fully relying on the market economics, we plan to run our own stabilizers to screen the markets for price variance and alerting us when the price deviates to levels outside of our tolerance. Automated countermeasures should be executed as follows but are not yet implemented. The first is when d euro prices decreases.
00:17:18.236 - 00:18:11.820, Speaker H: The stabilizer has an adjustable tolerance threshold for d euro following below our acceptable limit. This lower price limit triggers the stabilizer to sell Dank and buy undervalued d euro from secondary markets until the price is back within the set threshold limits. Additionally, our protocol can burn the de euro that it has just purchased in order to decrease the total actual supply of de euro and increase the individual value of every available de euro. The second automated countermeasure triggers when the price of de euro increases. If the price of dero increases above our 2% threshold, the stabilizer buys new dero for the primary market for the value of €1 and immediately sells them on the secondary market for the higher price. The profits are going to be used to buy more dank as future reserve to stabilize under evaluation. Additionally, this increases the overall supply of de euro and should also help to bring the individual price of each dero back to its peg.
00:18:11.820 - 00:18:34.890, Speaker H: Let me give you a demo of how it works. So here we have the exchange, a little bit of about page. I'm just going to show you r1 quick example of just exchange. Then bam. You can't see it on the recording but it shows up on the right. Best have a digital wallet. And below that is where you stake your stuff along with about US links at the bottom.
00:18:34.890 - 00:19:04.938, Speaker H: This proof of concept demonstrates several working core features of a euro stablecoin. For further development and testing, we plan additional functions and security features. Raising seed capital to bootstrap liquidity dupools would definitively kickstart the project to gain real market traction before we would launch on a live Mainet version. Check it out for yourself at digitalEURO Netlify app our project for awesome.
00:19:05.024 - 00:19:13.600, Speaker A: Well, that was a lot going on here and loved the name, so I'll just let our judges go into questions.
00:19:16.290 - 00:19:43.270, Speaker F: So I'm actually curious. It might have just gone by me quickly, but for dank to derive its value, the first thing that comes to mind, I think of it as analysis to MKR. But for it to retain its value as the backstop, is it coming from a right to a revenue stream? Is it coming from how does it provide that backstop? What is the value to that? Is it governance?
00:19:44.170 - 00:20:32.360, Speaker G: Yeah, very good question. So we looked at all the stable coins and we realized that you need a secondary asset, right? So we looked at reserve rights token and M stable and of course at MakerDAO how they do that. We want to incentivize users to provide liquidity and kind of AirDrop dank token to them for providing uniswap liquidity. We realized that you need some kind of value, right? So we said if we are going to launch the dank token, it's probably good if we have some kind of VC money or some serious amount of money to give it some value. But later on it would be similar to any other DeFi token in principle, like a sushi swap token or whatever.
00:20:33.690 - 00:21:15.800, Speaker I: Additionally, you can redeem dank tokens for when we're trying to correct the price downwards for excess digital euro that arises from the swaps. Because when the price is way low, lots of people are going to be swapping in lots of digital euro so they can get that easy quick arbitrage profit. And so when we need to lower the price, people who hold Dank can redeem their dank for excess digital Europe. So then they can execute the arbitrage and take profit rather than us do the arbitrage. So that also burns the supply of Dank, which kind of controls our issuance because dank gets burned up doing that and it also incentivizes people to call the update function so we can do the automatic rebalancing because there's a profit motive on their part.
00:21:20.890 - 00:21:32.860, Speaker D: Awesome. I'm curious, you guys mentioned raising capital and kind of pushing the project forward. What else do you guys need to build to sort of fully round out this idea?
00:21:34.350 - 00:21:56.402, Speaker I: Well, we wrote the rebalancing logic and we got it working in testing as a prototype. But as we approached the end date we started locking down all the kind of like mint functions and stuff and real world testing is important and also there's a revert somewhere in there and.
00:21:56.456 - 00:21:58.020, Speaker A: We have yet to find.
00:21:58.470 - 00:22:03.970, Speaker I: So we just need to kind of debug that and we should be ready to do some serious testing.
00:22:05.030 - 00:22:06.500, Speaker D: Great, thanks.
00:22:11.450 - 00:22:13.910, Speaker A: Do you have any other questions or comments?
00:22:15.050 - 00:22:20.220, Speaker G: Maybe the demo went a little bit short so if you guys want to take a look at the demo in the remaining time.
00:22:22.270 - 00:22:23.690, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead Barney.
00:22:25.470 - 00:22:27.660, Speaker G: Yeah, or no, sure.
00:22:29.570 - 00:22:55.540, Speaker E: I was just going to ask you in terms of obviously one of the biggest, I guess, risks with a stable coin is whether or not it can maintain its peg over a long period of time and in all kinds of market conditions. What kind of thinking have you done about that? About how the mechanics work in that sort of way and what do you need to do, I guess to take it from this kind of prototype to something that can be sort of launched confidently on a main net.
00:22:57.690 - 00:23:26.766, Speaker G: Yeah, sure. So we rely on two mechanics. Right? So the first mechanic would be we have a strong primary market which is our DAP, which is always issuing based on the current spot rate from the Oracle price. It's always issuing, buying and selling d euro exactly for the price of €1. And then on the secondary markets, like we're using uniswap in this case it could also be balancer or other secondary markets later on. There is always this kind of price difference which lets people arbitrage. Right.
00:23:26.766 - 00:24:04.380, Speaker G: So we kind of rely on that. And then we also looked at the keeper function. So what Ben was describing earlier, it's kind of similar to what the keepers with MakerDAO are doing that so we are scanning the secondary markets permanently. And then that's also the part why we need dank because we need the dank to sell and buy it to countermeasure if the price is fluctuating. But definitely this is one of the biggest challenge. Currently everything is live on the covent network, but this is really the challenge to test and audit everything before we would put this project on the main net.
00:24:05.630 - 00:24:14.670, Speaker D: And when you say you're always issuing, buying, selling euro, can you talk a little bit more about that mechanism? How does that actually work in practice?
00:24:15.330 - 00:24:15.982, Speaker C: Sure.
00:24:16.116 - 00:25:00.922, Speaker I: So we have two main contracts. We have the collateral vault contract and the manager contract. And so the manager contract has an interface for doing swaps. So when people want to get new digital euro, they take their Dai and they lock it up into our manager contract, which sends it to the vault, which is something we'll talk about later. And then they get minted an equivalent amount of digital yarn at the spot price at that time based on the Oracle. Right. But in order to maintain one to one collateralization, the vault issues dank when what the vault does is it says, okay, there's this amount of digital euro out in the world right now.
00:25:00.922 - 00:25:25.510, Speaker I: And then it says this is what its value in Dai should be. And then it says, this is how much the vault has plus an extra fudge factor because it's not feasible to be one to one directly. So we have to be like 125%. And then so using those numbers, it goes and sells an amount of dank tokens on uniswap, which is why we require people to lock up their LP tokens because the more liquidity that we have, the cheaper our loans are, basically.
00:25:25.660 - 00:25:26.360, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:29.450 - 00:25:40.330, Speaker I: And then the manager contract tries to maintain the price on open markets by doing buys and sells to raise and lower the price appropriately. Digital era.
00:25:40.750 - 00:25:41.500, Speaker A: Cool.
00:25:42.430 - 00:25:51.950, Speaker D: I would definitely want to look more into this automated issuing, buying and selling thing. This is pretty cutting edge. Good job, guys.
00:25:52.100 - 00:25:58.480, Speaker G: Feel free to check the link, our GitHub and also if you want, of course, hit us up for another zoom call after this.
00:25:59.330 - 00:26:19.800, Speaker A: Great. So we are out of time and we're ready to move on to our next project. So thank you so much, Nino and Ben. And next up, we have Chainabis, who is already on this call. And so I know if the whole team is here, solange, please feel free to share your video.
00:26:20.570 - 00:27:20.700, Speaker D: Yes, hello. I'd like to do cannabis plank manager using Matic network and binomic, but it's not working here. I have Matic mobile and I am in account where I don't have any Mat key. So I will define the T, I guess C, CHC and the CBD from a plant. So I will add a plant. The signature is okay, but I have another window. It's not okay if I try the same using the example.
00:27:20.700 - 00:27:39.110, Speaker D: It's working. So why you put a test here? Here. It's okay. You can check that. It's okay. It.
