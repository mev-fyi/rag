00:00:07.450 - 00:00:34.118, Speaker A: Now, next up, what I want to do is take some time to interview Juan Benet. Juan Benet is one of the founders and the founder of Protocol Labs, which you may know is the company and the organization behind Filecoin and IPFS. We're going to talk about a lot of things. So without further ado, let's welcome Juan on stage. Welcome.
00:00:34.284 - 00:00:36.360, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Excited to be here.
00:00:36.970 - 00:00:55.090, Speaker A: You've been a regular at a lot of our events, which is exciting because you have so much context about how everything is going. So what I want to do for today is talk about a handful of things. We want to talk about all the things that you're seeing are interesting. Let's talk about how do we do things about startups. Let's cover all the things that you are potentially kartik.
00:00:55.110 - 00:01:00.238, Speaker B: Tell us what are the most interesting problems that you've seen solved in the last couple of years?
00:01:00.404 - 00:01:35.782, Speaker A: Fuck, I thought I was interviewing you. All right, we'll get there. Okay. One of the interesting things, at least from my perspective, is that having been down this for the last six years, I get to see what the progress is on the developer side. The most obvious thing I would say is we have seen DevTools just get infinitely better. I remember four years ago, you would spend half the time at a hackathon just getting set up, and now you can click Clone a repo and it just magically works. Not just for basic DApps.
00:01:35.782 - 00:02:11.560, Speaker A: I think the best part is I think we just kind of saw with a lot of our partners, we're actually making hard things easy too. Like ZK proofs are getting simpler. I don't have to know effectively what is happening behind the scenes. If I can just remember the guy in pickle costume, I get to write stuff in TypeScript, so I count that as a win. Obviously, a big thing is scalability from just seeing everything getting clogged from the launch of CryptoKitties to where we are now with all these L two S, everybody deploying an Op stack. We've definitely gone to a few thousand transactions per second. Visa is somewhere between 8050, I believe.
00:02:11.560 - 00:02:35.838, Speaker A: So that's going well. And I would say largely the other thing will be overall, it is a lot more normal to say that things are on chain these days. Whether it's the convenience or whether you want to call it UX or just how cheap it is, I think on chain is becoming common. What do you think?
00:02:36.004 - 00:03:17.420, Speaker B: Great job. What do I think? So I think we solved a bunch of super interesting problems. From my view, the entire space has managed to build in the last few years an entire financial infrastructure that is self standing, using crypto economic incentives to now do much more financial processing than the traditional wire network, than the European wire network, and so on. And we can now do microtransactions and local payments and micro loans and so on. And so we have stood up basically a decentralized financial infrastructure for the world that nobody owns and it's a big.
00:03:18.430 - 00:03:21.622, Speaker A: That'S a win, that's a progress.
00:03:21.686 - 00:04:19.758, Speaker B: Well now I think that where we haven't done as well is in consumer applications. Right? So when you think about the applications that you use on a day to day basis, how many of the applications you're using today in your daily life are fully web Three powered? Like probably very few. Right, so when you think about communication tools like chat or messaging or things like Discord, when you think about forums or even the tools that we use to produce our software like GitHub and so on, this entire conversation is going to end up in a video platform. That video platform is centralized and so on. Likely. So from a consumer standpoint, in our day to day lives, most of our products haven't yet moved over to web three. And that's where I think we need to go next, which is like we spent the last few years building this really solid infrastructure and financial system.
00:04:19.758 - 00:04:31.150, Speaker B: Now we have to bridge it over to consumer applications so we can get most of the applications on the internet actually using the web three primitives and have the right structure.
00:04:31.310 - 00:04:41.682, Speaker A: Okay, that's interesting. Do you think that contradicts the common statement that blockchains are not databases? I hear you're saying everything should be more on chain. Is that the same interpretation?
00:04:41.826 - 00:05:25.566, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think blockchains are databases but they're databases that have this strong set of decentralization guarantees about them. Nobody should control them. You should have public verifiability to how you can get something included in the chain, who gets rights to change what part of the database. And so they're not like traditional database, whoever the admins are get to rewrite all the stuff. It's instead a public shared database. Now unfortunately the blockchains that so far have been built under extremely tight scalability constraints. We're finally starting to open up the bottleneck but it's nowhere close to being able to deal with the scale of use that modern consumer applications require.
00:05:25.566 - 00:05:39.030, Speaker B: Right, so think of something like Twitter or YouTube and think of being able to process all of the operations on something like that. Think of being able to build a social network entirely on top of these web Three systems. Like that's where we're headed.
00:05:41.470 - 00:05:49.018, Speaker A: But does that mean you're saying the scalability solutions we have are just not sufficient or they are not solving the same or addressing the same problem?
00:05:49.104 - 00:06:26.054, Speaker B: Yeah, not sufficient. So I think maybe a little bit of both. There are some problems that the current scalability structures don't quite get you there as many of you builders are going to try today and tomorrow your hacks will end up invariably needing a bunch of centralized infrastructure providers in order to pull off the kinds of programs that you want to build. And at every moment there, I think, like, oh, damn, this is still Web Two. Now you have to think about how do you move that into Web Three? And that's kind of the missing set of pieces. So some of it is think of, like, the back end services and back end data processing pipelines and so on. We need to build infrastructure for that.
00:06:26.054 - 00:06:53.198, Speaker B: I call that kind of compute over data networks. And the other part is just the raw scalability. The entire industry right now has been pushing really hard for scalability, and we're now getting to hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of transactions per second. I think we need to hit not billions, but trillions of transactions per second. Start yeah, start thinking in levels of all tweets going through some kind of blockchain infrastructure. We need to hit that kind of.
00:06:53.204 - 00:06:56.798, Speaker A: Scalability per second collectively, not on a.
00:06:56.804 - 00:07:38.522, Speaker B: Single instance, so collectively as the entire industry. But I do think you can get to this kind of level in kind of one tree. So if you think of Ethereum with the set of L Two S as starting to form a tree, think of that programmatically being able to expand to be able to deal with the demand of block space. Plus, you need to be able to do clear transactions way faster than kind of the current block time. You need to be able to do operations that are subsecond. So think of traditional data centers, traditional operations. You want to be able to do scalable, high throughput database updates, basically within a data center at subsecond speeds.
00:07:38.522 - 00:08:17.740, Speaker B: Once we can unlock that, then you can get the broad base set of applications rewritten in that Web Three landscape. So that's kind of the blocker between where we are today and the free Internet that we're all working towards. Right. So, this entire movement started with a goal of building these new, primitives, new foundational infrastructure to build a better rights oriented, human controlled, human data preserving Internet. In order to get there, we need to build that level of scalability so that any developer can target the cloud or can target the web free cloud, can target the decentralized cloud. So think about it that way.
00:08:20.670 - 00:08:25.306, Speaker A: I would say not contradictory. I would say the bold strategy.
00:08:25.338 - 00:08:27.040, Speaker B: Cotton let's see how it plays out.
00:08:27.970 - 00:08:53.526, Speaker A: Yes. Contrarian is the word I was looking for. We don't think about everything. I mean, even Web Two isn't thinking about having databases be optimized for this scale. So that seems like a now that you explain it, I feel like, okay, this makes sense if you're trying to replace something or offer both alternative, it's got to be least marginally better, more than marginally better. And in context, this makes a lot of sense. How does computing over data come into play here?
00:08:53.628 - 00:09:29.218, Speaker B: Yeah, so, when you think about modern services, some amount of the operation happens in the client side. So think of, like, in your phone or your browser. Some operations happen there some operations happen when you submit a request and there's some little bit of business logic that happens. A lot of that has been now built in kind of blockchain structures today. But a huge fraction of the computation happens machine to machine afterwards. It happens as part of background processing. So think of like if you upload a video to YouTube, YouTube has to rescale that video.
00:09:29.218 - 00:10:01.370, Speaker B: It has to post process it, it has to apply filtering, it has to figure out the metadata, it has to update a bunch of feeds. It has to push it to all the subscribers. There's an enormous amount of processing that happens behind the scenes. And all of that kind of computing infrastructure today in our industry is still happening in a fully centralized Web Two context. We need to get all of that kind of stuff to be able to be operating over a normal Web Three decentralized infrastructure. And so we need to get the computational primitives to be able to do that kind of processing.
00:10:02.750 - 00:10:08.682, Speaker A: What's missing in that primitive? Is it just having the sheer capacity to set up these pipelines or are we waiting for something to be invested?
00:10:08.746 - 00:11:03.870, Speaker B: I think one part of it is being able to do kind of like job scheduling or kind of being able to run kind of what normally would be in like a web server, but as services that are blockchain powered and that nobody runs or controls that you can kind of run in the network and that includes a lot of computation. So you can't put it in the modern kind of consensus throughput you should be able to kind of job schedule through that. So think of like Kubernetes style operation but over in this kind of decentralized setting. So that's one component, I think a separate component is being able to do just like these large scale data pipelines. So being able to define a job that you want to run over some data, you apply some function over that data, you compute the output and you kind of feed back the output into the network. So I think those two things are going to and kind of a broader scalability primitives are going to get built out over the next couple of years.
00:11:04.020 - 00:11:35.338, Speaker A: I think in fact, the Kubernetes is a pretty good explanation because we know how to visualize that. And you can set up all these nodes and clusters and run arbitrary code. So that actually will be cool. The more you kind of say it's clicking to me and it's becoming more obvious that maybe this is one of the reasons why I haven't seen a lot of good consumer apps. It's because we get to not fully replace every part of that stack with something that we think is better in terms of decentralization. But what's the prediction on how long it takes us to get to trillions of transactions per second?
00:11:35.424 - 00:12:25.338, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think we'll probably have the proofs of concept of this and the first versions of this kind of architecture live in the next couple of years. And then from there we'll probably have the first applications that are going to push all of their operations on top of these things kind of in the year or two years after that. So I think that within three to four years we might see the first fully native web, three powered social network or something like that, or game like an MMO or something like that that can just run completely on decentralized infrastructure. So not next year, not the after that, but this infrastructure is going to come into play. Then those use cases will appear and that will push the scalability up. So I think hitting trillions, probably five or six years out, but I think the tech will be there in two to three years.
00:12:25.504 - 00:12:47.490, Speaker A: Now that's a bold move. Let's see if it plays off. Yeah. Okay. So we talked about a couple of technical things that you think could use improvement. I guess one obvious thing that most people kind of don't realize that a lot of the things that blockchains also enable are just economic benefits in sandboxing. So anything kind of that you think is interesting as a theme that people are not experimenting enough with.
00:12:47.560 - 00:13:50.726, Speaker B: Yeah. So one of the most promising and valuable things of this entire space is the ability to create new funding structures or new governance structures around how humans and groups organize. So this means new kinds of ways of organizing people, organizing groups and so on. And this is where we have the capability of creating new kinds of structures. Like Dows are an example of this. But we need many more such mechanisms to do things like way better public funding, public goods funding, or network funding or network governance structures that can coordinate us into building way better infrastructure and services and systems for society as a whole. So I realized a couple of years ago that if crypto keeps growing at the trajectory it's had for the last ten years and we can get some good public funding primitives into the network, crypto could be funding science at the scale of nation states.
00:13:50.726 - 00:14:30.642, Speaker B: So just for everybody's knowledge, science funding around the world is kind of spotty. Some countries do a lot more funding than others. The US. Is one of the countries that funds the most, and usually this gets divided into different agencies around the world. The kind of funding scale is kind of around in the tens of billions of dollars per year for each of these countries. So you can maybe add all of them up and land on something like $100 to $200 billion a year for all of science funding worldwide. So if you think of like a nation scale, so like single billion or tens of billions per year, crypto could do that.
00:14:30.642 - 00:15:20.114, Speaker B: Crypto could actually fund science and r and d at a global scale. We're just missing the right primitives to be able to organize that kind of funding structure. And the long term feedback loop of showing that impact is returning value back to the entire crypto space so that that can create a feedback loop. So that's the kind of thing that I think is extremely exciting about crypto as a whole, like these new kinds of foundational primitives for organizing groups and all this kind of within the broader community of public goods funding. So you might have heard from groups like gitcoin or network goods or optimism with retropgf and so on. So all of these are kind of super interesting experiments for how do we use crypto native primitives to build these new kinds of funding structures. And I think that's one of the most exciting areas of the entire space.
00:15:20.312 - 00:15:43.498, Speaker A: No, I mean, that is actually measurable progress, too, because we can unlock so much and you can create these special interests groups that care about specific advancements, maybe for the hackers, too, in the audience. Is what you said a request for better tools or we need better economic models. How can we translate that to actionable things?
00:15:43.584 - 00:16:38.650, Speaker B: So we have a lot of ideas. So maybe two years ago we were missing ideas, and so now there's been a ton of conversation over a bunch of conferences and prototypes and so on. So we now have reached a point where we need to implement a lot of these ideas and test them. So we need both implementation of these into tools that we can use to run these kinds of protocols, and we need experiments that are actually going to try this and run this and collect data and see how well it works. And what are the problems? Like, what parts does it get right? What parts does it not get right? So we can refine and improve this kind of structure. The really cool thing is we're now reaching in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars deployed through this kind of public goods, funding oriented structures. So things like gitcoin, things like the network goods group and the retro PGF in optimism have together collectively deployed, I think, over $100 million now.
00:16:38.650 - 00:17:01.730, Speaker B: And so all of that yeah, and probably more. So all of that is using public goods funding oriented structures. And so think of that as creating a new class of organizational structures that can help us build a better future without having to appeal to just the traditional private funding reps.
00:17:04.070 - 00:17:18.726, Speaker A: That one makes sense, and I think that's actually a good way to think about how large groups or even small groups can actually coordinate this. A couple of things you said about kind of compute and scalability. Are these kind of things that you believe are specific to the falcon ecosystem or what's the context here?
00:17:18.748 - 00:17:47.410, Speaker B: No. So I think this is for the crypto world as a whole. If we can build these kinds of structures, then the whole world would benefit. And I don't know, I tend to not see a lot of the ecosystems as kind of as fragmented as maybe most people might perceive. There's a lot of branding from every different group and so on. So it might feel like tribalism yeah, tribal, different communities and so on. But in reality, most of these groups are extremely collaborative.
00:17:47.410 - 00:18:33.162, Speaker B: Their shared resources and shared code powers the whole ecosystem. And so there's an enormous amount of collaboration. So as an example, the IPFS ecosystem, which sort of includes the Falcon ecosystem, creates a ton of value for the Ethereum ecosystem, like Lipidop, which is something that came out of IPFS. Now powers Ethereum Two and powers Polka Dot and powers Celestia and a bunch of other networks. And then even something like Filecoin started as it's sort of like the OG Ethereum L Two early on in 2016. Yeah. So we originally wanted to ship Filecoin as an Ethereum, what we called at the time, a virtual network on top of Ethereum.
00:18:33.162 - 00:18:35.682, Speaker B: So the concept of L Two wasn't around yet.
00:18:35.816 - 00:18:36.914, Speaker A: What year is this?
00:18:37.032 - 00:18:40.242, Speaker B: This is 2016 or so. Yeah.
00:18:40.296 - 00:18:40.900, Speaker A: Wow.
00:18:41.430 - 00:19:17.520, Speaker B: But we calculated the throughput and block space that Falcon was going to need and it was about like 90% to 95% of the entire block space of the Ethereum based layer. So we couldn't do that. And so we had to then create a separate L One. But now we're seeing all of that reshuffling. And so my prediction is that we'll see lots of chains and lots of systems totally restructure and reshuffle themselves as the developer experience changes, as communities change and evolve and collaborate and so on. Like what we just saw this week, celo went from an L One into an Ethereum L Two. And so we'll likely see a lot of that kind of thing happening.
00:19:18.450 - 00:19:36.040, Speaker A: And I totally agree, I guess, on that theme. Okay, so let's say these predictions are good on timelines. In five years we see a trillion transactions per second, which means anything you can imagine is possible on chain. How should founders be thinking about building companies? And this is obviously the best time to start.
00:19:37.290 - 00:20:32.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I like thinking about this in terms of maybe a set of stages that builders should kind of think about when you're in a hackathon context. And this is one of the reasons why I love hackathons as much and where you spend so much time and thought working with builders through hackathons. Hackathons give you this great environment where you can learn a ton, you can push your skills, you can explore a bunch of different areas, but you have a limited time to be able to make your thing, complete it, and deliver it to be judged right. And you have to also get good at presenting it. You have to solve an interesting problem for somebody. You have to learn how to sell it to somebody. And so all of that forces you to go through the entire kind of like product design validation loop in one go in a very fast pace and it teaches you a ton about lots of different things and you'll get a ton of feedback.
00:20:32.114 - 00:21:25.798, Speaker B: So that's kind of an example stage that builders should go through. So when you're first kind of thinking about potential ideas, one part of that is get to being able to build like a minimum version of the product, like a prototype or something like that. Hackathon is a great example for that. It'll force you to start validating your ideas. Now at some point you'll find something that you think is compelling and interesting and you think that it potentially has legs and you are getting interesting feedback from others that maybe there's something here, maybe this could turn into a startup of some kind, whether it's startup company or a startup network or some other kind of project. At that point what you want to do is refine the idea and look deeper into it, try to validate it more, think ahead to what it could turn into, think about who would the users be, what are the early communities you could work with and so on. So this is kind of a deeper validation step and that will start informing what needs to become your first minimum viable product.
00:21:25.798 - 00:22:25.226, Speaker B: Right? So you go from like early ideas, early prototypes into something that you think will actually work. That's like the keyword there is viable meaning some product that you can actually create for users and for whom you're solving a problem and for whom are going to then start relying on your thing. Once you have that in place, you have the trajectory for a startup and again, this could be a startup company, it could be a startup network or a startup open source project or something like that. The mode really depends on what the kind of thing that you're building is and at that point you kind of want to start thinking about what's the scale of this thing, how much funding are you going to require to build this, how many other people do you need to work with to organize this? And so for the startup company Trajectories, there's kind of fundraising as an option or I guess for all of these Trajectories there's fundraising. It just changes structure. Like in open source you're probably raising grant funding. In startups you're probably raising venture capital or something like that.
00:22:25.226 - 00:23:00.850, Speaker B: In crypto networks you're sort of somewhere in between and that pushes you into kind of the next stage which is formulating this as a company or a network or something like that and then raising capital going through an accelerator or something like that. So right now, where all the builders here are, I would strongly encourage you to be experimenting with this hackathon and future hackathons to find an idea and get to validating something that could turn into a minimum viable product. You won't get to your full MVP through a hackathon, but you might get to something that'll let you take that next step. And so think about that sort of broader trajectory.
00:23:01.010 - 00:23:14.778, Speaker A: As someone who's kind of been through the traditional funding route and also an interface with the decentralized world, any common bad advice that you think is given out for building startups that does not really apply to better than it doesn't apply to web three companies.
00:23:14.864 - 00:24:02.474, Speaker B: Yeah. So the traditional startup ecosystem has to be extremely competitive and extremely closed and private because the nature of those kinds of products are that all of AIP is very closed and highly proprietary or zero sum, very zero sum oriented. And this whole ecosystem is extremely positive, sum oriented, highly collaborative. Most of what everybody's building is open source. You can take it and fork it and try something else. And so you end up with a much more collaborative environment where all of the groups building, whether it's like L ones or L two S or services or products or whatever, tend to collaborate dramatically more. So one of the big things that I kind of see is you want to coordinate and cooperate as much as you can and you want to be very open with what you're doing.
00:24:02.474 - 00:24:16.350, Speaker B: You want to create a community early on and build a broader community of users, developers and participants that are going to help your product or your system grow. And that's very different than traditional startups.
00:24:18.130 - 00:24:34.146, Speaker A: Makes sense in hindsight. Well, I want to close off by well, in this case, asking the same question you asked me. You've been here in this space for almost a decade, more, maybe more. Where would you say we're in this space and I guess zooming out? How do you think we rate ourselves on the progress we've made?
00:24:34.248 - 00:25:15.150, Speaker B: Yeah, so look, I keep it maybe short and sweet here. I think that this community has built some of the most compelling and important infrastructure for humanity broadly, especially right now, the finance stack is really solid, but the broader communication stack and the broader internet stack is following. And now that all these primitives are here, you as builders get to shape the next big thing, the next important set of components. So it's really up to you. It's really up to what you want to build and what you make and what you scale that will define the future. So go make it a good one and hack on really cool stuff.
00:25:15.300 - 00:25:17.260, Speaker A: Amazing advice. Thank you so much. Thanks.
