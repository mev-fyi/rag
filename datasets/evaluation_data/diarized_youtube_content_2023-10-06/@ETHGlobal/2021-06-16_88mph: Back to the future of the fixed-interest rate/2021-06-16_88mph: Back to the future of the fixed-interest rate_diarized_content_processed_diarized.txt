00:00:10.090 - 00:00:25.040, Speaker A: Okay. Hi everybody. Welcome to the Back to the Future of Fixed interest rate workshop. Here we have Guillaume and Zifram from Ada Mph and they're going to be running this workshop today. Guys can take it away.
00:00:27.450 - 00:00:50.780, Speaker B: Thanks for the introduction. So hey everyone, thanks for joining. My name is Guillaume McFly, I'm the co founder of Atmph and I'm leading everything related to community marketing, design stuff, project development and we have zephyrum also with us. zephyrum, if you want to introduce yourself.
00:00:51.390 - 00:01:03.700, Speaker C: Yeah, hello everyone. I am zephyrum, I'm co founder of Adamph and I'm also lead developer. So if you have any technical questions, feel free to ask me.
00:01:05.110 - 00:01:56.750, Speaker B: Yes. So guys, we will make a quick product tour of eight mph, what you currently have on Mainet. So we are talking of Mainets, we are referring to mainnet as V two, but we are here to talk mainly about our upcoming V three. The smart contract are already ready into our GitHub repo subgraph is ready, so we will talk mainly about that. But if you want to have a real product working on Mainet, we will go on the V two. And after I will show you quickly the V three, we will present you the price, what you can build with 88 APH v three. So some product IDs use cases and after Zephrum will present you a deeper overview of new smart contracts.
00:01:56.750 - 00:02:54.834, Speaker B: I will share my screen and we will go directly on my browser. So, as I was mentioning, this is the V two available on 88 mph app. You can see on my screen that you have different tabs where you can find the product. So we have the main product. 88 mph is a fixed interest rate protocol. So you are using 88 mph mainly to get a fixed yield on your stablecoin or crypto like different rapid version of Bitcoin, FM, CRV and other stuff like that. We are supporting die of course USDC and you get a fixed yield on this asset according to the maturity you want.
00:02:54.834 - 00:03:22.854, Speaker B: So we are supporting maturity between seven days and one year. So it's up to you to find the correct duration you want. And the yield we are offering is fixed terms. So for example, let's say right now you want to deposit die. You can have 2.9% fixed interest rates on your die for let's say one year. And on top of that you get some mph API.
00:03:22.854 - 00:04:03.310, Speaker B: So mph API is just a rewards that we offer you to use the platform. On top of that, what you can do with your mph, you can stake them. So we have a staking pool where we share 100% of the protocol revenue with the stakers. So basically you just take your mph and you earn cash dividend. And the other part I will present you directly that on the V three. So I will go to my local host and I will show you that. So this is the new version of 88 mph.
00:04:03.310 - 00:04:52.262, Speaker B: We are not here to talk about front end, but just a quick tour of what you will find on mainnet in a few days. This is the part where I was mentioning you can get fixed interest rates. So same thing, you can deposit die or different version of bitcoin and you get a fixed interest rate on top of that. And as always, you get the mph rewards for using the platform. So some novelties between v two and v three. We wanted to improve the user experience for end users, but also for developers. So the core focus through the V three was to be as easy to build on it as it is to build on Ave or compound.
00:04:52.262 - 00:05:55.360, Speaker B: So if you plan to use 88 mph for AC money, it would be fairly easy to integrate. So that was the core focus for us. That means for the end user that there is also some improvements, mainly for the fixed interest rate users. They will have more flexibility related to the way they manage their deposits. So you will be able to top up your deposit, you will be able to roll over your deposit also withdraw early as it is on v two. The other main focus we wanted is removing the money flow, if I can say like that, rewarding the mph rewards because we were requesting people to pay back a certain amount when they wanted to withdraw at maturity their deposit. So for example, you see here I have a die deposit, it will be mature in approximately 300 days.
00:05:55.360 - 00:06:39.206, Speaker B: So when I will withdraw that if we were just staying on V two, I will need to pay back a certain amount of mph rewards. With V three we get rid of that. So you don't need to pay back anything else. You just keep the mph rewards you got initially when you deposited. And with this mph rewards, what you can do is basically stake your mph directly here to get Xmph. So that's a novelty. Also with the VF revilitate mph you stake mph for having a representation of your stake mph with Xmph.
00:06:39.206 - 00:07:23.306, Speaker B: So it's auto compounding, you can do other stuff with your Xmph. There is different use cases you can have with other protocol. But I won't go into these details right now. Just quickly rewarding the way we share the revenue with the protocol. Stakers get 100% of the revenue we get from harvesting governance token. For example the Ave token, the compound token of the harvest token, farm token. Also we have a fee applied to the fixed interest we paid out to our depositors, so we take 10% of it.
00:07:23.306 - 00:08:00.658, Speaker B: So also that platform fee go directly in the pockets of the Mph takers and the last product. So we went through the fixed interest rate products. You deposit crypto, you deposit stablecoin, you earn fixed interest rates and mph rewards. With that mph rewards you can stake them to get Xmph. So basically it's a dividend. You get protocol earnings. And the last big part of big features of Athmph V free is the yield feature.
00:08:00.658 - 00:09:29.870, Speaker B: So the yield features allow us to derisk 88 mph by allowing our users to speculate on future yield. What does that mean? When someone deposits stablecoin into 88 mph they are basically creating a deficit by we are promising them a fixed interest rate. So this fixed interest rate need to be secured by someone somewhere, so somewhere is 88 PH and this create a deficit in each pool where they are depositing. So to be sure that at the end of the day when someone want to withdraw their principal plus the fixed interest earned so far, they can do that. We introduced the yield token and this yield token is basically a ERC 20 that you can buy and it allow you to speculate and earn the interest of a deposit of Atmph. So at the end of the day, let's say you can basically speculate belong on the market rate, on compound or Ave with a fraction of the capital needed to earn the interest on this amount of capital. So let's say you have like ten die worth of yield token.
00:09:29.870 - 00:10:19.410, Speaker B: This yield token allow you to earn on a certain amount of deposit of 80 ten PH. So let's say 100 die. So you are speculating on the yield of this 100 die and you earn that amount of interest on this principle. So at the end of the day, you don't need much to earn interest on a lot of capital. So it's really a speculative tool, but really interesting in term of capital efficiency and also in term of opportunity. So, last thing I wanted to say before going into the price presentation, you can run this version directly on your computer by going directly on our GitHub repo in the V three branch. So you will be able to see what I'm showing you right now.
00:10:19.410 - 00:11:42.282, Speaker B: So, quick overview of the price we are offering at AC Money. The first price is 4000 USDC and the runner up the second place is with 1500 USDC. Plus we have a pool price of 2000 USDC. So if you decide to don't build directly a product focused only on 88 mph, but you want to use some components of 88 mph, you can get a certain percentage of this pool price of 2000 USDC. If you decide to build something really cool on top of 88 mph and 88 mph is the car products under the hood, you can earn up to 4000 USDC. And if you have a runner up it's 1500 USDC. And the things we are looking for with the price and what we want to incentivize people building is stuff that can at least simplify the user experience for people like retailers who want to earn really easily.
00:11:42.282 - 00:13:08.822, Speaker B: Fixed interest rates, feeling secure, doing it without the complexity you can have dealing with different components of what we currently have on V three. But something the other thing we are really looking for, and maybe it's the most important part is leveraging 88 mph fixed interest rate bonds. So what we have in the earned part and the Mph rewards also and creating something that can generate yield for other protocol or a cool way to manage governance treasury, generating some strategy in term of investment asset management that can generate a fixed income for other protocol. So that's also something interesting and there is a lot of discussion happening right now on Twitter and on different community for managing this kind of governance treasury. So 88 mph can play a role there for sure. Other cool stuff we are looking for is structured products. So what is a structured product? There is different flavor of it, but the most obvious one is you are able to guarantee the capital, the initial capital.
00:13:08.822 - 00:14:00.250, Speaker B: You are putting in a structured product and you are exposed to upside of some assets. So for example you can mix a fixed product of 88 mph. For example, one of our bonds. Like, let's say you are using a die bond with an option and so you are able to guarantee the capital with the bond and you expose the user of the structured product to the upside of something like an option of just a random asset like e for something simple like a commodity. That's really something cool. It's a huge market in the traditional finance. There is some development happening right now in DeFi, but it's still an early stage ecosystem.
00:14:00.250 - 00:15:01.878, Speaker B: So there is a lot of opportunity with that. The other things you can do is using the bonds. Let's say right now you see on my account here I have a bond in Dai earning me fixed interest rate with $9,000 worth of die in that deposit. So imagine I'm able to take that deposit and put it somewhere into another protocol and use that as a collateral for borrowing more die and redeposit directly in athmph. So you are improving a lot the capital efficiency of Atmph by doing that. It's really something that we are looking for also there's good product to build on top of that for sure. And other things let's say a bit more less innovative but really useful is improving the way people are feeling about at Mph.
00:15:01.878 - 00:15:51.260, Speaker B: So basically you can think about at Mph as a bank, a DeFi bank where you deposit money, you earn interest. What people want when they use this kind of product, they want to trust it, they want to be sure that at the end of the day they will get back their money plus interest. So we need to build trust, we need to build derisking tool. So currently there is the yield token, that is the main purpose of it is derisking the protocol by allowing someone else to buy the debt of the system and speculating on the floating waves. So that's one layer of derisking. But there is other cool stuff to build to derisk the protocol, like a safety module leveraging the stakers to derive the protocol, a bit like Ave is doing. There's some stuff like that.
00:15:51.260 - 00:16:22.360, Speaker B: Or over loss reserve or insurance fund directly built into Atmph. So feel free to brainstorm about that with your team and don't hesitate to ask us questions regarding all of that can be built. I will hand over the workshop to Zephron if you want to share your screen to show us some stuff related to the V Three.
00:16:26.730 - 00:17:28.620, Speaker C: Yeah, let me just go over the developer documentation we have and just a general overview of where to get started. Sure. So this is our smart contract repo. Make sure you're on the V Three branch so that you're not working on our current version. But yeah, our README should give you a good general overview of the smart contract architecture and how all the actions the users would make work. And we also have instructions for how to get started on your local machine. And here, let me just show you the D interest Smart Contract, which is the main smart contract that you will be interacting with.
00:17:28.620 - 00:18:20.140, Speaker C: This is where users can deposit their funds to get a fixed interest rate, withdraw their money, and where other users could buy yield tokens. As you can see, we have some documentation for all the functions. And here at the top we have all of the state changing functions listed. So you have deposit, for instance, you just specify the amount of tokens you want to deposit and when you want the deposit to be mature. And that's basically it. You just make one contract call. As Gamma said, our focus in V Three is to make the developer experience really simple.
00:18:20.140 - 00:19:20.762, Speaker C: And similarly, you can top up your deposit, you can roll over your deposit to a new maturation, you can of course, withdraw your funds. Or this is for buying the EO tokens. And there are also a bunch of getter functions that you can use to fetch info about your deposits. And finally, let me just show you our subgraph. So we use our subgraph extensively in our front end to easily and efficiently fetch information about the user deposits, about the pools and so on. And this is our V Three branch again. And this is the GraphQL schema for all of the objects.
00:19:20.762 - 00:19:51.850, Speaker C: And you can see we have an entity for the pools where you can see the users and some general information you can fetch entities of users and their statistics and of course you can fetch information about individual deposits and so on and so forth. And yeah, I think that's all you need to know to get started developing on admph.
00:19:55.550 - 00:20:11.280, Speaker B: So just to confirm with you Zephrum, all of that is available publicly into our GitHub repo. Just check the V three branch on each repo. So we have the repo for the smart contracts and the repo for the subgraph, right?
00:20:13.170 - 00:20:16.786, Speaker C: Yes, it's all public cool.
00:20:16.968 - 00:20:57.280, Speaker B: So I hope guys this is clear for you related to where to find things. All things work. I suppose you will have a lot of questions regarding some specifics, some details related to the subgraph of different function of a smart contract. So don't hesitate to jump directly into our discord or the ifglobal discord. We have a sponsored channel there where we'll be super active in the following days and weeks to answer all your questions. I just saw that we have some questions in the chat on Zoom. Do you want to take one that is maybe you will be happy to install that one.
00:20:57.280 - 00:21:05.470, Speaker B: Yeah what is the difference with Element finance 88 mph via Sus?
00:21:06.550 - 00:22:47.358, Speaker C: Yeah, I can answer that. So as far as I understand, element Finance is all about separating the yield from the collateral. So it's really simple like you just take funds stored in for instance wire and you tokenize the yield that's earned on your collateral from your collateral itself. And one of the applications of element finance is to provide to let you earn a fixed yield on your funds. The difference is in the architecture sorry? In the architecture we have the risk models and the implementation, we're two different products trying to do similar things and the main difference of Element finance is that they require the usage of liquidity pool and an automated market maker in order for them to be able to provide a fixed interest rate. So basically you would split your funds into your collateral and yield tokens and sell the yield tokens on an AMM and the amount you sell for is basically going to be your fixed yield. Whereas in Admph we don't require the usage of an AMM at all, our focus is solely on providing a fixed interest rate and that gives us some advantages.
00:22:47.358 - 00:23:46.280, Speaker C: For instance on element if you are trying to get a fixed yield on a large sum of money then you would suffer slippage because they're using an AMM to provide the fixed yield and you also need a really deep liquidity pool so that you can actually get an okay rate from them. Whereas in Admph we use our interest rate oracle to determine how much of a fixed rate to offer to our users and we use a completely different approach to actually offer that fixed interest rate mainly through the pooled risk model and through selling the Admph yield tokens. I hope that answers your question.
00:23:49.530 - 00:25:19.170, Speaker B: And the one from King of China, do you return the dollar amount of original coin amount? So if I understand correctly your question, when you deposit, let's say Dai, you are earning the interest in Dai so you deposit BTC or BTC for example, you will receive your interest plus the initial capital in OBTC. So each pool you earn interest with underlying assets and for the stakers they earn Xmph. So we are distributing the yield in Xmph. But we are not minting Xmph from nothing. We are just converting, if I can say like that the protocol fee and whatever we are best on other protocol like Comp Farm, the staked version of Ave, we buy back the Mph on the market and we distribute it in Xmph. So I hope it's clear your mind regarding that we are supporting, as I said, different assets. We are planning to launch more pools with vfree with different protocols.
00:25:19.170 - 00:25:50.880, Speaker B: Mainly we are supporting right now compound Ave harvest and wire under the hood. But we plan to open more pool in the coming weeks, mainly with cream b protocol also. So stay tuned with that. Yeah. Therefore, do you think we need to mention something else related to the price or some stuff related to what can be built with it?
00:25:53.730 - 00:26:02.160, Speaker C: No, I think we covered everything. You mentioned the structured products, right?
00:26:02.850 - 00:26:46.990, Speaker B: Yes. Tomorrow if you want to have an overview of what we are currently cooking with V three, the way we are seeing the scaling solution, the way we want to scale also 88 mph on layer two or different side chain, tomorrow we have a community call with Phantom Foundation and ZK sync directly on our discord. So if you want to jump directly in the community call tomorrow. It's at 01:00 p.m. Eastern time. So feel free to join us. And if you have questions related to AC money and the way you can build stuff, don't hesitate to join us tomorrow.
00:26:48.370 - 00:27:05.060, Speaker A: Okay? Thank you guys so much. Thank you to Ada Mph also for sponsoring hack money this year. Again, if you guys have any questions, hit them up in the discord. And yeah, thank you guys for coming to the workshop and for hosting. Bye. Like.
