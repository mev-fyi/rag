00:09:22.800 - 00:09:43.892, Speaker D: So this is a question to squarenix. And in terms of that business model having to do with the game title. And of course, the increase of the sales would drive the business overall. In a way, the blockchain dilemma has been overcome in your business model and in your industry. But what is your update on how you see the market right now on.
00:09:43.946 - 00:09:55.940, Speaker B: The blockchain and web3 hi Shi Monoga, Sakuro Moshe, Medium Digital, Shirano Digital Sticker.
00:09:58.760 - 00:09:59.492, Speaker A: And this guy.
00:09:59.546 - 00:10:05.750, Speaker B: So you point to God.
00:10:06.700 - 00:10:23.470, Speaker D: Well, in terms of our endearment with NFT, I have introduced the million author, and that is the only one that we are launching. And this is, in fact, selling NFT. So we have not been able to fully embrace the capability of any NFT yet in its in our business model.
00:10:24.960 - 00:10:41.430, Speaker B: NFT minaritomon Kakazan there you are. Whatever the guy tells on the customer.
00:10:49.980 - 00:11:19.760, Speaker D: So in order to just sell the MFD on the market, we need transparency. Therefore we know how much has been issued and you can do the math in order to calculate the revenue that we are getting. But from that, the level of the revenue versus how much cost it will be incurred in developing a new game title it's fast, too small and it's out of balance. So we have to therefore come up with a new business model in order to monetize this effort altogether.
00:11:21.940 - 00:11:25.220, Speaker A: Brokechain game monetized through Brook chain.
00:11:30.920 - 00:11:36.070, Speaker D: Do you think it's the fact it's a blockchain game? There's a lot of demand in the market or interest in the market.
00:11:41.240 - 00:11:49.580, Speaker B: The game no do you whatever could do k tay Totem but digital cute sangha Basing.
00:11:57.280 - 00:12:17.270, Speaker D: In the past, the players on our game console was sort of borrowing the platform that we are offering. But now because of NFT, each of the players and customer are owning a digital asset and they need to purchase them. So they are quite concerned about the value that they own. So that's the level of energy that we are seeing in the market.
00:12:38.400 - 00:12:48.908, Speaker A: Nangapo Genjo Denoso Artist Nanko Nasokai and.
00:12:48.994 - 00:13:09.830, Speaker D: Turning to ABEX I think this is more of a management of the individual sort of artist as an asset. So now that the NFT sort of Hype has now become a little stable and a little quenched from the Hype area hype time Series so what do you think is the artist's expectation on this new technology?
00:13:11.000 - 00:13:32.936, Speaker C: Solace name mazuano correct game to ungakina game interactive technique my NFT Okitai must.
00:13:32.958 - 00:14:44.390, Speaker D: Kanji must so first of all, in terms of the world of game and world of music, I think the attitude of the participants are quite different in terms of a game isn't more interactive, it's a more participatory nature of how game is being played versus music is just listening and passively listening to what's been distributed. So I think when we talk about NFD for music, it's more or less quite deeply interrelated with the rights issue, the copyrights and such. So when we talk about then distributing the copyrights, the rights being withhold the company side, entity side, it's quite complicated and difficult to tackle this issue.
00:14:44.840 - 00:15:08.100, Speaker C: The Yapari Chiba Kenoka the KOKONI handles the artist of Samo Sono Ivaru Kono JIDO Tekiniki Mora NFDO Makikunde Interactive Nando You Community of Tskutikatokurova Nagami so the Miyata.
00:15:15.440 - 00:17:28.696, Speaker D: And the situation surrounding us with music and with artists is that artists themselves are very much interested with this new technological capabilities. And of course, musics are something that is passive. In other words, people are going to be listening and how that could be related to NFT that is more interactive and how we be able to involve these NFT holders as a whole community I think is the area of interest from the artist's perspective. So in the overseas market, what we see of how NFTs being utilized by the artists themselves is this is quite a tricky zone because it may infringe with the legal requirements and regulatory requirements. For instance, Rihanna she has given NFT to her music and then she would be able to monetize from creating NFT but that revenue is being redistributed to the marketplace. But if we are to do this in Japan, it is going to infringe the so called premium law, in other words giving premium to the users or customers. So that is a barrier that we see today.
00:17:28.696 - 00:17:57.630, Speaker D: So music itself, even if one would have the proprietary right to hold the music by NFT, the music itself needs to be distributed in the market otherwise it's useless. So that of course right of NFT is we utilize or leverage to influence the marketplace to seek higher distribution of the music and song itself. But again, in overseas this could be possible. But in Japan there is a liberatory barrier for so called premium law.
00:18:03.640 - 00:18:21.100, Speaker A: Kanyeko Kangan saran ichiban diso tegi mason the Kirinu karata motor mosquito tama are you Kanji?
00:18:21.200 - 00:18:21.576, Speaker C: Are you?
00:18:21.598 - 00:18:22.330, Speaker B: No, no.
00:18:33.580 - 00:19:15.030, Speaker D: So I think what you are saying marvel is that in music if you replay the music there will be some kind of a renumeration or reimbursement of the listening to the music to the original owner. That kind of I think this distribution system is what you are advocating from what I hear. So let's say there is a notion of distributed YouTube and it's part of the YouTube that has been cut out or curved out and reutilized and if you use that there is going to be some kind of monetization model, it's going to reimburse to the original YouTube sort of a player. So that automatic distribution method is, I think what you're saying.
00:19:15.640 - 00:19:42.940, Speaker C: So this man hawaii toshini Guido. Guido soko kara motoristoka, mora tikonoko jitanga masano kinso hoshtaka Tekura anything and Nakira oshari HIV and mora kakazanga to the Parim.
00:19:45.080 - 00:20:08.632, Speaker D: So in a way, it's yes to what you have said, because NFT you need to buy them. So it's going to be an investment. So if you are the holder of the NFT and if you are going to seek another different channel in monetizing, what you have fold that again is going to infringe the premium regulatory law here in Japan. So that is the difficulty.
00:20:08.816 - 00:20:54.340, Speaker C: Ah, but ashramaja to imanutan commentostato moon the skill the more and otaskani IMA imani Snay and cassie de kitashi and oki show hinto shalboki showhogano samazamana sagi so Kanyaru Gatima so it monogar no day but daisy nanoa artist. Hakino SCOs them all or show you status neto sono hayung and Jokyo nikon atarasi joke.
00:21:06.480 - 00:22:10.510, Speaker D: So if I may jump into this discussion I think in terms of holding a token and then what you have owned from the ownership of the token and reallocating that once again to the third 3rd party. It is very true that that is going to infringe the premium law in Japan, but that of course law in itself is there to protect the consumer from fraudulent activities. So there is a meaning and viability of having that law. But now have heard that the artists themselves there are a lot of sort of a fans or community to try to endorse or trying to support that artist. And it is a legitimate, of course act to hold the right of the artist song and then try to redistribute that and then there's an allocation of the earning, although it could be an infringement of the law itself. I think that is a reality and it's good to know that there is a market and demand for that then that will ultimately, I believe, will lead to the revision of the law in long term. So that's a good thing to know.
00:22:11.680 - 00:22:33.060, Speaker C: How to sanimaran more than the skill or tattoo.
00:22:35.180 - 00:23:01.310, Speaker D: And I have a question to hadasan you mentioned about the game only here in Japan, the Millennium author and I tried that game yesterday and I think it's a great amount of interest to the Audi audience as well. Is there any other game IPS that for instance, you have famous Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. Are you going to involve NFT scheme to these well known game titles? Do you have plan for that? This is the most.
00:23:03.880 - 00:24:00.340, Speaker B: Corporate member you know. Hanasha Sternoga NFT Final Hunters to Kadero and Cristo aishuga ikato mazua ano kangaribiki sono ano Natanisha and Koi g o yunaka day sai shui techni soyu IPO no keta Tokini okyak sanga mo brokuch and Kai nifty tajiming asuka sono isokta Binja drone Guest final Fantasy no seta today the NFD no user.
00:24:03.880 - 00:24:51.780, Speaker D: Thank you for the question. It is the most frequently asked question and I've been told from the company corporate not to answer them. But in fact in terms of the overall statement I could share here is that NFT and Blockchain how that could be well worked with Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. The IPS, I think it has to do with the affinity, it is not the direct line of having this technology advancement and linking that back to a very well known or popular game title. So I believe that if there is a true need or quest from the customer base, the player base, that they truly want to see this NFT technology embedded in this IP, that's a different question. But I think the maturity of the market is not still there yet. The familiarity of the technology by gameplay is not there.
00:24:51.780 - 00:25:01.990, Speaker D: So we have launched a NFD kind of a version of Final Fantasy, but there's a very negative comment towards that. So I think it's too early for us yet.
00:25:08.800 - 00:25:34.150, Speaker A: Sektakini ma periodo mokanzenisano kanariko Sekaiju Wakara omonsiro saga matan nisano okanamita and ezani okikawaru mita Nakoto there.
00:25:45.160 - 00:26:28.630, Speaker D: So again, the other question is that in the world of games, there are a lot of people who are wanting to embrace Blockchain, the pros and cons. In other words, those are supporters of technology versus those who totally would like to stay away from the technology. And there is a big gap, I think, between these two sort of a world of players who are for technology and against technology. And some people say that just introducing NFDM blockchain, it's just demonetizing the game that they play and that loses the true nature of enjoying the game in itself. So these two different world, the bipolarized situation, how is your perspective on this situation?
00:26:30.040 - 00:27:36.880, Speaker B: No so destiny Media sticker chisai Koroni Shiru Mako you measure and like hi Nantokamanti kushta Shimmy digital Skypa no digital Shi Santos and Temoto you know Kurushi Nandara market to praise demo Maurici king War scudder cannot tomotono Day no.

00:27:36.960 - 00:27:37.204, Speaker D: No.
00:27:37.242 - 00:27:38.550, Speaker B: Is Cindy at the bus?
00:27:40.080 - 00:28:20.008, Speaker D: In terms of the digital gear sticker that I talked about earlier in my presentation, that's something that we are doing as of now. And you may remember in Japan, there used to be a confectionery or snacks that comes with these stickers if you buy them, and everybody enjoyed that and everybody knows that. So that was the original starting point of the gear sticker that they talk about. But now it's a digitalized version. So the blockchain technology is embedded in the sticker. So it means that if you have the sticker, you can own the digital asset called sticker and then even you can exchange them in a marketplace exchange. So that is a way of how we are introducing this blockchain technology.
00:28:20.008 - 00:28:52.076, Speaker D: And it is true that there is a people that highly embraces blockchain and they do all sorts of things which bring about a lot of negative sort of impression of the utilization of technology. And that's a lot of shame. And they have done too much in the adverse utilization of technology. So what we are doing is that we would like to promote blockchain in a more positive manner so that it would bring about enjoyment and pleasure to all the people. So that I think we need to advocate the good use of this technology.
00:28:52.178 - 00:29:41.070, Speaker B: Blockchain um Atosa liesu games david NFD motor masai koi wimu in the cigar noah imaskati mirrors on game imam game atomo is to got you toast on the medio there. So as on. There digital shiri got scurry by haku and coding height whatever you soy do. Yeah timmy there nakato tone to cute point.
00:30:07.800 - 00:30:52.324, Speaker D: So why think that next week we are going to be launching the game and the sticker that I talked about and you can play them for free complimentary on your browser. So I hope everyone will be able to try out this game. I recently received a lot of interview from the media on this. But in terms of the IP that we own and IP that we are creating, of course we would like to make the conventional game players happy. But I think the other intent is to acquire or go after new people who have never played games. I mean, it's free of charge and it's digitalized. So if you create or own your own sticker, you have an asset of your own and you can even exchange them in the marketplace and you'll be able to get ¥100 or ¥200.
00:30:52.324 - 00:31:22.060, Speaker D: And we already are creating schemes for that. So many of the people you may enjoy frequent mileage programs, you accumulate point and it's going to be converted to something good that you want to do. So it's kind of like those things housewives, they enjoy collecting point from the store nearby, so it could be a good experience. So we are creating this great experience for the new game players and it's not really Monetizing. And that is the reason why we always have a conflict with a senior executive of the company, because they're interested in Monetizing.
00:31:22.640 - 00:32:05.440, Speaker A: This is an and ma Yosen sono Sakur yan chao Igado hiroto Nagatana Masaro kirokada TATOBA monoso community Tunoa Igato kai Moria garioni and oh Kan candy Steak nanisono Kiku sono sabiska kandi arteta broke Chandama sono kanditoka sono hata mita mono. Monoton monotono.
00:32:09.460 - 00:32:48.988, Speaker D: So I have a question to both of you. I think the issue with blockchain technology could be in notorious overuse of the technology in a bad manner. And I think blockchain is just only a scheme. So there's a tremendous amount of freedom associated with it. So those who would be able to be lucrative in this blockchain system, they would be, and those who would, maybe people will lose money because of this blockchain. So it's just a scheme. So I think important is the community notion that's been talked about, I think by Hatasan and how you positively manage the technology and positively try to evolve the technology by means of service.
00:32:48.988 - 00:32:59.964, Speaker D: So that I think is needed. In other words, a positive motivation or motive is needed. So that is my update in terms of listening to both of you. So if you have any comment on this, I would like to receive your feedback.
00:33:00.092 - 00:34:21.580, Speaker C: So the snitchodo halasantomo state community to funko IPO taking on the. So my fang Narika joe for hashin suratokoro community in Aruto height of can appoint to the Korean point to that sonakoto and Akte shisa mina de project on Lakadia take an. I take an as an icon.
00:34:25.200 - 00:35:13.052, Speaker D: And I think what I think is that when I was discussing with Yonangasan in the background, that the community notion, I think it should be web3, or you can even call it a fan club. In the past, in the conventional world, the fan club community was only one way. In other words, the artists are disseminating information and there will be a lot of fans in the community. But in the world of web3, I think everyone in that community will have a sense of ownership that they are taking part in operating this community as an operator. So that sort of a notion. The difference in terms of the stance or posture I think is very hard to understand from the management team of the music company. They feel that they have to make everyone happy, but they don't know how to do so.
00:35:13.052 - 00:35:38.550, Speaker D: But I think in the community, each one of them would own an asset, and they're responsible for that, and they needs to be a facilitator, or everyone will be a facilitator for the community itself. So that's how it should function. But I think they're understanding there's still a great amount of gap towards that. So that, I think, is how we would need to go about in advocating the community. And every one who owns a part of that asset would be able to function and facilitate as a community.
00:35:43.800 - 00:35:44.496, Speaker B: For the studio.
00:35:44.528 - 00:35:48.580, Speaker D: Tony Mass so that concludes this panel.
