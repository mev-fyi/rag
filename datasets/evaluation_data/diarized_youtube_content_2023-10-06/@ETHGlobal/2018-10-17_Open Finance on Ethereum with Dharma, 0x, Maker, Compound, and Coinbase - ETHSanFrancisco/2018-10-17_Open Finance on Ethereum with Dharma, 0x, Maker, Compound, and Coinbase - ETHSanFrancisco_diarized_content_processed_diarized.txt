00:00:00.570 - 00:00:24.830, Speaker A: So, everyone, we are starting the I'm going to project and be a little loud for the people in the back. We are starting the Building An Open Financial System panel, but we are actually going to start by having presentations from the individuals making up the panel. And we are going to start with Sid from Coinbase Wallet.
00:00:29.610 - 00:00:50.134, Speaker B: All right, morning, everyone. Thank you so much for showing up first thing in the morning. Very excited to do this, excited to see all the hackers here. I'm Sid Coilo. I'm the product lead at Coinbase Wallet. And today we're going to be talking about building an open financial system. We're pretty lucky to have, I think, with me, some of the pioneers of decentralized finance.
00:00:50.134 - 00:01:30.038, Speaker B: And so we'll go through each of these projects one by one and then settle in for some Q A. So let's start with coinbase wallet second. There we go. So Coinbase Wallet is a user controlled mobile crypto wallet and it supports not just ethereum, but also digital assets built on top of ethereum. So, ERC, 20 tokens as well as, ERC, 721 collectibles. It's also a DAP browser where we try and a we try and curate the best DApps out there in the ecosystem. But we use web3 JS, so we're interoperable with any DAP.
00:01:30.038 - 00:02:10.214, Speaker B: So if you've built a DAP and it's mobile responsive, it should work on Coinbase Wallet. We call Coinbase Wallet the consumer gateway to the decentralized web. We're a mobile app, once again available in the App Store. If you haven't tried it, you can go to the App Store or the Play Store and check it out. Now, the reason we built Coinbase Wallet at Coinbase is that we feel it's going to help kick off the second phase of crypto adoption. So the first phase of crypto adoption, as we see it, is the investment phase. And this was really about helping people go from fiat into crypto and making it really easy for them to do that.
00:02:10.214 - 00:02:45.850, Speaker B: So our first few businesses were the consumer brokerage that you've probably used Coinbase.com and then the exchange, and then followed by a few other institutional focused businesses. But we believe the second phase is what we're most excited about and that's the adoption phase and the utility phase. So that's where people are actually using crypto for things. And in order to use crypto, you need to have your own wallet. Another big reason that we built Coinbase Wallet is that we believe that a wallet and crypto should be available to everyone. And an open financial system, by definition, is available to anyone anywhere in the world.
00:02:45.850 - 00:03:13.466, Speaker B: And so that's why, unlike regulated exchanges or regulated products with Coinbase Wallet anywhere in the world, all you have to do is go to the App Store, download the product and you now have a wallet that you can access all of the crypto space. And finally DApps. Right? That's why we're all here today. We've seen an explosion of building in DApps. 18 months ago, there were almost no DApps. Now there's almost 2000. And we wanted to create a platform that lets you access these.
00:03:13.466 - 00:04:00.998, Speaker B: If you look at the DAP space, there's a bunch of different kinds of financial services, DEXes, there's marketplaces, there's social media, there's jobs. And underlying that, there's a whole set of infrastructure which is different kinds of token standards, protocols, side chains, identity standards, stablecoins. And what's really missing is a really easy to use product that lets a user who's new to crypto navigate all of this ecosystem. If you go back ten years, right, we used to have phones and we use them to make phone calls. And then the iPhone came along and emerged as the portal to explore the new world of internet connected mobile financial applications. And really, it changed what the word phone even meant. And that's what we're trying to do with a wallet.
00:04:00.998 - 00:04:30.900, Speaker B: We're saying a wallet is no longer just someplace that you store your crypto, it's actually a portal into this whole decentralized web and the gateway to access all of these applications. We've also worked hard to make Wallet as developer friendly as possible. So if you're building a DAP at the hackathon, we support testnets, we support custom tokens, we use secure enclave technology to safeguard your users private keys. And so we've tried to make it really easy to build on.
00:04:31.750 - 00:04:33.214, Speaker C: We're also offering a prize.
00:04:33.262 - 00:05:04.750, Speaker B: So we have the Coinbase Wallet prize at ETH SF for the best mobile friendly DAP. It's a $1000 prize. It doesn't have to be a mobile only DAP, but as long as it also works on Coinbase Wallet and you have a mobile responsive front end, it should work and you should be eligible. If you have any questions or you need help bidling, just go to wallet coinbase.com. We have a really user friendly guide written by Pete Kim called Building Mobile DApps. You can also reach us on Wallet. Devs@coinbase.com
00:05:04.750 - 00:05:10.830, Speaker B: or we have a discord, so you can reach us there as well. Thanks very much and happy biddling.
00:05:19.520 - 00:05:25.180, Speaker A: Thank you. Coinbase wallet. Up next is Will from Zero X Protocol.
00:05:30.820 - 00:06:19.730, Speaker D: Hello. Hope everyone's having a good morning. So I didn't prepare a presentation for this event, so I'm going to use an older presentation and we'll try and get the main ideas out there. So Zero X is an open protocol for low friction peer to peer exchange. And why does this need to exist? We believe that the world's value is becoming tokenized. So all forms of value that exist in the world, we believe will eventually be represented as digital tokens on public blockchains like Ethereum. So this ranges from traditional assets like fiat, currencies, stocks, bonds, prediction markets, video game items, software licenses, really anything you can think of.
00:06:19.730 - 00:07:28.550, Speaker D: It makes sense that these assets are moved onto globally accessible open rails public blockchains. So if all of these assets are going to be tokenized, you need a way to exchange them without diving too deep into how zerox protocol actually works. What does it mean that Zero X is a protocol? So Zero X is not a decentralized exchange. It is a protocol that allows people to build decentralized exchanges on top of it. And it uses a method called off chain order relay. So why build an open standard for decentralized exchange? What's the benefit to doing this? And the reason is because, as we're already seeing today, there's many, many different decentralized exchanges that are being built on the Ethereum blockchain. We don't really need to have like 20 different smart contracts all doing the same thing.
00:07:28.550 - 00:08:50.850, Speaker D: It means that the users have to trust many different smart contracts with their valuable digital assets. It means that there's duplication of effort and 20 times more opportunities for bugs and ways to attack these smart contracts. Secondly, if you have an open standard for exchange, it allows us to create a set of developer tools that are robust and provide a very good developer experience. And if many relayers so these entities that kind of shuffle orders back and forth between different counterparties, if they're all built on top of the same exact open technical standard, it allows them to share liquidity between them. It allows different decentralized applications to pull liquidity from these relayers and it leads to a more liquid and deep market. So this is a pretty old slide, but since we launched Zero X version one in October of 20 or August of 2017, there's been a variety of really cool, decentralized exchanges that have been built on top of Zero X. And there continues to be a lot of really great development on top of Zero X today.
00:08:50.850 - 00:09:50.768, Speaker D: But what's really exciting is that we just recently shipped Zero X protocol version two and Zero X protocol version two opens up a ton of new possibilities for developers that are creating marketplaces or DApps on top of Ethereum. And there's many, many features that are worth exploring. But because I have limited time, I'll just talk about one that's particularly exciting. Zero X version 2.0 has a brand new smart contract architecture that supports ERC 20 tokens, ERC 721 tokens, and can also be extended to support any other token standard that might emerge in the future. So we're very excited about the emergence of games, virtual video game items on the Ethereum blockchain. Things like Gods on Chain Loom Network is doing some really great stuff.
00:09:50.768 - 00:10:30.656, Speaker D: CryptoKitties was a great first example of video game items on the blockchain. So using Zero X you can now trade these things with anyone in the world for close to nothing. We have a booth in the back. We also have a lot of materials on our blog and on our website that make it very easy for you to get started. Using Zero X, it probably takes no more than an hour to get a functioning relayer operating on the main net, or at least to do some very rudimentary trades. And we're going to be here all weekend to help you if you have any questions. And we're also just happy to chat with you about anything you're interested in.
00:10:30.656 - 00:10:33.970, Speaker D: So thanks for having us and yeah, thanks.
00:10:42.920 - 00:10:47.700, Speaker A: Thank you. Zero X up next. Andy from Maker.
00:10:59.820 - 00:12:15.120, Speaker C: Hello, my name is Andy and I represent the MakerDAO project and we seek to create a cryptocurrency called Dai. Dai is a stablecoin, which means that it is a cryptocurrency with low volatility relative to the world's most popular fiat currencies. And this makes it more useful as a form of digital money because as you know, Bitcoin and Ether and other fixed supply cryptocurrencies are famous for their insane, sometimes almost reckless volatility and are not suitable for use in the normal world of business, which has hindered mainstream adoption of these open crypto networks. So Dai and other stablecoins seek to usher in the next wave of adoption and make crypto networks more suitable for use in business. So how does dai work? Dai is issued dai can be issued by anybody in the world when they take one of their crypto assets, such as Ether and lock it up in the MakerDAO Dai credit system. Smart contracts. They lock it up as escrow or collateral and then issue Dai against it by borrowing it later.
00:12:15.120 - 00:12:47.340, Speaker C: When they want to retrieve their collateral, they simply return the Dai that they borrowed, plus a fee based on how long it was outstanding. This system of credit, borrowing, lending and returning plus a fee, should sound very familiar to anybody who's ever used the world of traditional finance. Right, so what we're doing is we're taking a very intuitive, sort of recognizable idea and transplanting it onto the Ethereum blockchain. So how does it work, this system of collateral, this system of credit?
00:12:47.410 - 00:12:47.644, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:47.682 - 00:14:05.264, Speaker C: How do we know what assets can be used as collateral in the system? This is decided by the owners of a second token called MKR. MKR is the administrative or governance token of the network and its holders make decisions about what types of assets can be used as collateral in the system. In exchange for their services and the work that they do managing the portfolio of collateral assets, they receive the fee that Dai borrowers pay when they pay back what they borrowed to retrieve their collateral. And in this way, the incentives are aligned where the maker holders basically work together to provide a service for the Dai holders and make sure that all Dai is backed by high quality, valuable assets. So on the flip side, if they do a bad job, then the value of MKR is tapped to back any positions of borrowing that were backed by assets that were unfortunately valueless. Right? If an asset suddenly goes to zero overnight, then the value of MKR is used to back die. So there's sort of two sides of the equation.
00:14:05.264 - 00:14:38.136, Speaker C: On the one side, if the MKR holders do a good job, then the value of MKR should be expected to become more precious. And then on the flip side, if the MKR holders do a bad job, then the value of MKR should be expected to depreciate. So this is a very sort of simple system. It's one of the oldest Ethereum projects in the entire space. We actually created the project before Ethereum even launched. We've been working for a long time. And last year, in December of 2017, we launched the first version of Dai.
00:14:38.136 - 00:15:43.590, Speaker C: It's live today. There are about 53 million Dai in circulation today, and all of them are issued against ETH. This is because the first version of Dai can only take ETH as collateral. But over the last year, we've been diligently hard at work on the next version of Dai, which will be able to take any type of Ethereum asset as collateral, which is a very exciting sort of next step in the overall stability of Dai, right? Because if you have many different types of assets backing Dai, then that means if any single one of them experiences a sudden decrease in value, then the value of the other ones can be used to protect the entire system, right? So we're sort of consolidating a lot of this risk. So that's a very basic overview of the system. Like I said, we just recently released the code for our next multicolateral version of the system, which is very exciting. We're hoping to launch very soon, probably towards the beginning of next year.
00:15:43.590 - 00:16:27.980, Speaker C: If you have any questions about this because this is like a super high level overview. I skipped basically every detail that there is in the system. But if you want to come and poke holes in it and kind of figure out how it works, then come find me afterwards or anybody at the maker table down there. And furthermore, if you have any use case for money in your DApps or your hacks here at Eat San Francisco, then there is a prize that will be awarded to the best applications that use Dai in their system. And also there will be another prize that is awarded to the best data visualization of borrowers in our system. So that's all for me. Like I said, super high level overview.
00:16:27.980 - 00:16:37.110, Speaker C: But please come and try to poke holes in our system because it's always fun to do a little sparring back and forth when people try to kind of get to the bottom of this. Thank you very much.
00:16:46.370 - 00:16:51.070, Speaker A: Thank you, maker. Up next, Robert from Compound Finance.
00:16:58.950 - 00:17:43.600, Speaker E: All right, you guys are a great crowd. You're probably building some amazing smart contracts and some amazing DApps. What Compound offers is a series of superpowers for what you're building. And before I go into those superpowers, I'll quickly tell you about what Compound is. Compound is a series of token money markets accessible to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. For every ERC 20 token that we support, we offer an interest rate and we also offer the ability to borrow those tokens. Now, why does anybody want to earn interest on a token? And why does anyone want to borrow a token? It's very simple.
00:17:43.600 - 00:18:24.838, Speaker E: Most of the smart contracts out there have a balance of tokens. Most users have a balance of tokens in their wallets and most of those assets sit completely unused. With Compound, you can sweep assets into our money markets and earn a prevailing interest rate. Your smart contracts now have a business model that they didn't have before. If you're building something today that's going to have a balance of tokens, you can upgrade your contracts and actually earn incremental returns. The second thing we offer is the ability to borrow any tokens. Why is this important? Your smart contracts can borrow auger and participate in a prediction market without owning any auger.
00:18:24.838 - 00:19:06.406, Speaker E: Your smart contracts can borrow zero X tokens to trade with and pay fees with without owning any Zero X tokens. Your smart contracts can use any protocol without having to predict and buy those tokens ahead of time on demand. The smart contract can borrow assets as they're needed. In addition, you get to borrow assets for financial reasons. Your smart contract or the users of your smart contracts and DApps can actually borrow tokens to speculate with or to short sell. It's incredibly flexible. So as you sit down, think about ways in which you could potentially monetize tokens or you could potentially borrow tokens.
00:19:06.406 - 00:19:25.950, Speaker E: That's what compound offers. The smart contracts are deployed to rinkbee and as of a week ago, onto the Ethereum mainnet and everything is live. If you build something with Compound, we're not specifically offering a bounty, but we will take you out to dinner and celebrate you. Thank you so much. And keep on hacking.
00:19:33.760 - 00:19:39.100, Speaker A: Thank you, Compound. And up next, Nadav from Dharma.
00:19:44.700 - 00:20:47.832, Speaker F: Hello, everybody. How's everybody doing? So I'm going to tell you guys a little bit about what we've been working on at Dharma. So, Dharma is a protocol that enables borrowing and lending on the Ethereum blockchain. Basically, the way I like to think of Dharma is as this kind of global, decentralized credit market. And the kind of protocol that actually enables this credit market to exist is what we're basically developing. So how does it actually work? So there's kind of a few components of this whole system, right? So the first is what we refer to as Dharma Protocol, right? This is just like a technical specification that defines this message format for how you request loans and fill loans as a borrower or lender a layer. Above that, you have a whole kind of suite of smart contracts and developer tools that actually enable these orders to be generated and filled and then kind of shared amongst different liquidity pools.
00:20:47.832 - 00:21:53.430, Speaker F: And then finally a layer above that you have what we refer to as relayers, right? And so Will just came up recently and explained how the Zero X Protocol works. This is a really similar concept in Dharma. Essentially, relayers are centralized order books that host these loan offers and loan orders and earn some sort of fee every time one of those loans are filled. So in the end, you kind of get this full stack, decentralized peer to peer lending marketplace that is accessible from anywhere in the world, is entirely permissionless. So if you want to build some sort of application that plugs into this network, you don't have to go shake hands with us or sign a contract with us or be a New York Stock Exchange member or something like that. You just build it right away and then finally it's uncensorable. Right? So literally, if you're in a despotic country or you for whatever reason, are locked out of the traditional financial system, you are able to access credit through this system.
00:21:53.430 - 00:22:42.340, Speaker F: So we've been live on the Ethereum main net since around May of 2018. There are three live businesses that are built on top of Dharma right now that are servicing peer to peer loans every single day. We, as far as we know, are one of the first sort of implementations of a system that enables people to actually borrow and lend on the Ethereum blockchain in a global context. So this is a really high level, glossy overview of how the protocol works. So I'm more than happy to dive into some more specifics afterwards. If you're interested in learning more about what Dharma is, how it works, what people are using it for today, and what we think they'll be using it for in the future, come find us afterwards. We have a table in the back over there.
00:22:42.340 - 00:23:16.350, Speaker F: We'd love to meet you. Also, we are sponsoring up to $2,500 in API prizes. So if you build an application that plugs into the Dharma credit network in any capacity, be that literally building a peer to peer lending application or some sort of wallet that automatically pulls credit liquidity from the market, we will be interested in awarding you with up to $2,500 in prizes. So thank you guys very much. Excited to speak with the rest of the folks on the panel in a second.
00:23:23.870 - 00:23:30.860, Speaker A: You can just stick around and we'll have everybody else come up. It's time for panel building an open financial system.
00:23:32.910 - 00:24:05.530, Speaker B: You all right? Thanks, guys. Those were amazing intros. I'm just going to do a quick recap. I just took some notes on what each of these projects is for people that are new. Right. Will Warren, founder of Zero X a Protocol for decentralized exchange. And you read in the news every week about an exchange being hacked somewhere in the world.
00:24:05.530 - 00:24:53.018, Speaker B: The Zero X Protocol reinvents that architecture altogether and creates an entirely more secure form of exchange. Then Andy CTO of MakerDAO maker uses a collateral pledging system to ensure that every Dai coin is always worth close to $1. So effectively creating a digital dollar, but with all the benefits of crypto trustlessness and borderlessness. And then Robert, founder of Compound, makes it really easy for you to either lend or borrow on the blockchain. And instead of having to go out and look for counterparties, the smart contracts handle that for you. So they balance supply and demand. And all you do is if you're writing a DAP, you just look up a smart contract, deposit money or borrow money.
00:24:53.018 - 00:25:21.838, Speaker B: So that's great. And then finally, Nadav, a protocol for tokenized debt. With Dharma, anyone, anywhere can just start to issue debt or accept debt. You know, really exciting, and I think what's most exciting is how all of these products tie together. If you really want to illustrate what an open financial system is, anyone can install a wallet. Like, say, coinbase wallet, fill it up with ETH. Then they can go to a zero X relayer, converts that ETH into Dai trustlessly.
00:25:21.838 - 00:25:56.814, Speaker B: Then you can send that dye to say, my family in India, and they can receive it and treat it just like as if it was a US. Dollar. Or I could take some of the Dai and go to Compound or go to Dharma and either invest my money or issue debt or lend money to other people. And so really, all of this happens without we didn't do any business development agreements between each other. We didn't get any licenses. We didn't have to build APIs for Interoperability. We just built products on shared common standards and things just work.
00:25:56.814 - 00:26:29.126, Speaker B: And that is what it means to have an open financial system. So with that, I just want to kick off with a couple of questions, right? I'm going to start off with some stats, right? These are the sizes of the markets that you guys are targeting. There are currently $580,000,000,000 of US. Bills in circulation outside the US. The global bond market is over $100 trillion. The global money markets are $3.3 trillion, and global exchange revenues were $31 billion last year.
00:26:29.126 - 00:26:47.550, Speaker B: And so these are just staggering numbers, right? These are just mind boggling numbers, the size of these markets. And that's what these entrepreneurs are trying to tackle. So I guess the question is from where we are today, and I'd love to hear from each one of you, how do we get for each of your products to the first million users?
00:26:49.410 - 00:27:22.250, Speaker E: Sure. So the first million users is going to be the hardest million users. After that, it gets a lot easier with Compound. What's interesting is that anybody can build on top of our system. And I think the first million users at Compound are not going to come from a million different users interacting directly with our protocol. It's going to come from a million users using mobile applications or using any type of financial service that in the back end sweeps assets to compound or borrows from compound, users won't even know that they're using compound indirectly.
00:27:24.030 - 00:27:24.442, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:24.496 - 00:28:07.042, Speaker D: No, I agree. I think it's the on ramps that are going to be doing the hard work. So things like coinbase wallet, things like im token, these are the ways that we're going to be getting DApps into the hands of end users. I think another kind of Trojan horse for getting crypto in the hands of end users is again, like video game items. People love to play video games, they love buying cosmetic skins and stuff like that. If there's a way for them to kind of buy and sell them, trade them, I think that something that people will get really excited about. So I could see video games potentially being like one of the first use cases that gets kind of like mass adoption.
00:28:07.042 - 00:28:08.520, Speaker D: But we'll see.
00:28:11.390 - 00:29:07.142, Speaker C: One of my favorite things about protocol development, whether it's from earlier stages of internet history or today, is the fact that everybody's collectively working on shared resources that we all benefit from and could never individually invest the time or resources to create. And so similarly, I think that the rise of these crypto networks sort of democratizes the expression of transnational business. So I think that it democratizes this ability to act internationally which has typically been only accessible to the largest big business enterprises, right? And I think that one of the biggest potentials for disruption is actually going to be in existing small and medium enterprises suddenly having access to global liquidity and then global financial systems that they were simply locked out of or were too small to access before. So I think that getting the first million users is not going to necessarily.
00:29:07.206 - 00:29:07.820, Speaker B: Be.
00:29:09.790 - 00:30:04.630, Speaker C: Necessarily be taking crypto and putting it directly into the hands of people who might have otherwise never thought about it. Instead, I think it's going to be going to existing businesses and saying, look, now you can act internationally and you can stretch your reach a lot farther than you could before. And you can do that in a way where you don't have to invest a ton of resources. And it's just like you get that right now because of all the work that we've been putting in for years kind of on your behalf. So I think that actually it's going to be a really big sort of efficiency play where these existing businesses can be presented with just a way to reduce their cost and then get features that they never even would have assumed are possible. Like for instance, in our system, Dai, we offer sort of like high quality cost of capital that is really only accessible in the developed world today. And so because it's an open permissionless system, you can expect somebody in the developing world who might have never had access to borrowing rates of that caliber.
00:30:04.630 - 00:30:26.440, Speaker C: Suddenly it's accessible to them and they can borrow at a rate that is comparable to the developed world and that's just huge for somebody who might otherwise have to go to a loan shark, for instance. So I think that efficiency play is going to be really big for just getting crypto into the sort of lower levels of the existing supply chain, business infrastructure and global financial system.
00:30:28.410 - 00:32:26.970, Speaker F: So, first of all, I'd emphasize that I agree with all the answers that were given so far in that yes, absolutely. These decentralized financial primitives will lie in service of, at the end of the day, the two plus billion people that are unbanked, or even the just remaining 5 billion people that may not have access to the best financial. Services, but would have access to better financial services if there was a singular, sort of globally accessible market for loans, money markets, et cetera. Where I would defer, though, and where I would kind of push back, is that I think that given the sort of state of UX in this space right now, using financial services that in some capacity interact with the blockchain has a lot of friction to it, right? It's something that is largely, at least right now, accessible to mainly technical audiences. Now that's obviously going to change and everybody here is making a bet on the fact that's going to change. But I think that at least for the foreseeable future, for the first million users or so, it's more likely that those are going to be people that didn't have access to whatever this financial service is in the analog world than it is necessarily these people being like your average run of the mill consumer lending customer, right? And so I like the example that Will gave where he mentioned kind of gaming as like a Trojan horseshoe and I think that's like a great example, right? Whereas if you look at these sorts of emerging economies in which there just literally is no financial system, that's where we have the best beachhead of making a difference because we don't have to compete with the existing UX of the financial system right now. And so while we're waiting for wallet technology to catch up for the blockchains to scale themselves, it makes more sense to tackle markets which just don't have any sort of financial system in them right now.
00:32:26.970 - 00:33:30.350, Speaker F: And I think that's reflected in the fact that when you look at all the lending protocols, for instance, or any protocol that touches lending, the people who are taking out those loans for the most part are doing it for speculative purposes, right? They're mainly right now doing it to either short various assets on the ethereum blockchain or to take some sorts of levered longs here. And the reason why I highlight this example is because the reason they're doing that, even though it's like totally crazy, insane UX to use a blockchain right now, is that there's just not really good alternatives for these things. Like, if you want to short a random, ERC, 20 asset, there's not really good established markets for that. And so the point that I would make is that I think that it's much more likely that the first million users come in from the esoterica and they come in from the margins and from random lending markets that didn't necessarily exist in the analog meat world. It's much more likely that that's going to be the case than it is that it's going to be people doing kind of traditional meat space financial services directly on the blockchain.
00:33:30.770 - 00:33:56.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that answer. And this actually brings me to question I wanted to ask Andy, which is, to your point, Nadav, that sometimes the best places to launch a product are where people don't have access to that service and they really feel the pain. And I know that Maker's been planning multiple go to market initiatives. What have you guys been doing to target state developing markets or places where a stable coin would really help out?
00:33:56.730 - 00:34:56.182, Speaker C: The big announcement that we made this summer was with Tradeshift, which is a supply chain platform that's trying to digitize the very, very analog process of the supply chain. And I think that this is sort of like an opportunity that we're seeing right now, which is supply chain finance. So in the world of supply chain, when you sell something, when a supplier sells something to a buyer, typically the buyer pays later, sometimes 30, 60, or even 90 days later after they receive their goods. And that creates a huge cash flow problem for the supplier. Now, that's usually fine for a large player, but like I was saying, these small and medium enterprises have a lot of trouble with this cash flow because they have no access to credit, especially if they're in the developing world. And so we literally see coffee growers in Guatemala, shrimp fishermen in Thailand having to go to local loan sharks and accept loans at like 300% interest because that's literally the only thing that they have access to. And that's terrible.
00:34:56.182 - 00:35:48.170, Speaker C: It breaks my heart to know that people are getting squeezed like that. And so I think that this is like a huge opportunity that we're seeing on the credit side. Now, on the stablecoin side, because we really have two things here, right? We've got a credit side, the ability to borrow, and then we've got the stablecoin dai, which is the ability to exchange. On the stablecoin side, I actually completely agree with Nadav and say that for users of Blockchains and particularly DApps, there's just no good opportunity. Like, for instance, Auger, right? You have to use ETH to bet an auger. It's a very novel, interesting system, but the fact that ETH is there just presents such a UX headache for them and it's just not their core competency to create a stable medium of exchange. So I think on the stablecoin side, a lot of it will be other interesting novel DApps that just simply need dai to even exist, to even conceive of their own existence.
00:35:49.230 - 00:36:06.340, Speaker B: And Robert and Nadav, we were talking about the difficulty of switching gears a little bit in lending markets, creating liquidity by getting both sides of the markets so specifically around people that are actually looking to borrow. What are some of the difficulties you're seeing there and how do you plan to solve it?
00:36:07.110 - 00:36:52.222, Speaker E: So at compound, there are no counterparties to lending and borrowing. The protocol itself is always willing to accept your assets or it's always willing to lend to you. And what that means is you don't have to find somebody with the exact opposite view of you at the exact same time. So there's no duration that you have to agree to, there's no interest rate that you have to agree to, there's no counterparty with the exact opposite view of yours, with the same credit parameters or collateral requirements as you. You can simply call a supply function and it always works. And you can simply call a borrow function and it always works. What we've done is we've eliminated all of the frictions and replaced them with a very simple spot interest rate that's always available to you.
00:36:52.222 - 00:37:07.030, Speaker E: And so that's our approach to allowing a market to grow is making it always work instantly. You don't have to wait for any other counterparty to come to existence and so it reduces the difficulty of scaling a two sided marketplace.
00:37:08.570 - 00:37:13.430, Speaker F: Yeah. So you were asking about the challenges, is that correct?
00:37:13.500 - 00:37:16.210, Speaker B: Yeah, challenges, especially around liquidity on both sides.
00:37:16.290 - 00:38:13.834, Speaker F: Yeah. So I think I'll kind of address this question both in two parts. So the first part is like challenges in secured lending. So if we're dealing with collateralized loans, so pretty much all lending that is happening in the decentralized financial space right now is fully collateralized, right? So if you're a borrower, you have to put up a bunch of dies collateral if you want to take out a bunch of ETH or what have you. And in the collateralized lending realm, I'd say the biggest challenge that I've seen so far is that there just seems to be a big supply side glut, right? So there seems to be a lot more people that want to lend out their assets and earn some sort of interest rate right now than there are that actually want to borrow these assets to short them or what have you. And so we have a lot of ideas on how we want to actually address that. I think it really lands all over the place.
00:38:13.834 - 00:38:42.622, Speaker F: Right. We need better UX at the end of the day. Borrowers need to have a better experience when they're actually taking out loans. There need to be more flexibility in the actual terms of the loans that they're taking out, in the collateral ratios that they have to put up. So essentially, I think there's not one silver bullet answer. I think there's a lot of things that need to be addressed in order to get volume up. On the borrower side, on the unsecured side, there are enormous challenges.
00:38:42.622 - 00:39:20.574, Speaker F: Right. So if you want to do unsecured lending in which there isn't any sort of collateral that has to be put up by the borrower, which is kind of like the Holy Grail, that's like what we want. Right? That would be the dream if anybody in a developing world, country or something could take out a loan and die and not have to put up any collateral for that. We need good identity systems which have yet to been really cracked yet. There's a lot of smart people working on it, but at least I haven't really seen anything come to market yet that's gotten meaningful product market fit. And then the next step beyond that is having good reputation systems. Right.
00:39:20.574 - 00:39:30.500, Speaker F: So being able to essentially judge people's credit worthiness. Similarly really smart people working on that right now. But it's super early and we haven't really seen that happen quite yet.
00:39:30.870 - 00:39:44.040, Speaker B: Yeah, identity stuff, lots of people working on it. You could see where it fits in with unsecured lending. What about with the exchange? Is identity important to the exchange space? Is identity important to the exchange space?
00:39:44.650 - 00:40:35.510, Speaker D: I think it will be for assets like securities. So if you want to issue an asset as a token on a blockchain and you need to comply with existing regulations, compliance is critical. You have to have identity there. So there's a variety of projects that are working on KYC AML and Identity which inherently require identity solutions that we're pretty excited about. Three off the top of my head that are really cool are Harbor, Polymath and Zeppelin's. Transaction permission layer are all really yeah, I mean, I think for that specific use case of assets that have been traditionally regulated, then yeah, you're going to have to have identity.
00:40:36.570 - 00:40:58.960, Speaker B: Cool, thanks. So I have another question for you, which is that in the past when entrepreneurs built businesses, they built the entire business, including going to customers and having an end user interface, but you chose to build a protocol instead. And so how does that affect your business strategy? How you think about growing the business because you're operating a protocol as opposed to a full end to end business?
00:41:00.290 - 00:41:51.630, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean I think it's not that different from a lot of other traditional businesses that are focused on developers. So like developer platforms like Twilio or things like that. I would say that one big difference is that because we still have customers, right? Our full time job is to help developers and Relayers be successful. And if we're not doing that, then we're failing. And so we're very focused on creating great developer tools, making it very pleasant experience to create DApps using Zero X. We have customers and we have responsibilities to serve them. But on the other hand, with a traditional business, you have investors and you have to be generating revenue and profits.
00:41:51.630 - 00:42:22.054, Speaker D: Whereas with us, since we're not focused on generating revenue, I think it allows us to be much more focused on our mission and we don't have to water it down in order to get our profit margins up or anything like that. So I think it allows us to create, really just focus on providing the best tools for our users and developers and we don't have to worry about things like extracting rents from them or anything like that.
00:42:22.252 - 00:42:37.582, Speaker B: Sweet. And then, Robert, you took a different approach, right? So you built both the underlying smart contracts, but then also the front it, and you've recently launched as well. So I'd love to learn. How has your post launch been? What's your go to market strategy? How do you plan to grow?
00:42:37.716 - 00:43:17.578, Speaker E: Yeah, that's a great question. So at Compound, we built an underlying smart contract platform as well as the first interface on top. And our vision is that over time, more and more developers are going to build smart contract layers on top of compound that monetize tokens or borrow from our protocol, and there's going to be more and more developers that build their own interfaces for special use cases. A great example of this is we expect developers to build systems that borrow from Compound and trade on zero X simultaneously. And so our go to market strategy was just having a minimum, viable, usable experience for a user, knowing that most users don't want to wait for better systems to come out.
00:43:17.664 - 00:43:18.746, Speaker B: When we launched, we wanted to make.
00:43:18.768 - 00:43:48.210, Speaker E: It as simple as any Web Three enabled browser, coinbase wallet or MetaMask enabled users to simply supply assets into the protocol or borrow from the protocol. And over time, we think that the ecosystem on top is going to get better and better and better. And so in the weeks since we've launched, we have about $3 million supplied to the protocol, which is liquidity available to anyone who wants to borrow. And we've had about 50,000 $60,000 borrowed. So it's a small and early start, but the future is only bright.
00:43:49.190 - 00:44:16.938, Speaker B: Awesome, thanks. So we have a bunch of hackers here today, so I wanted to just do a quick round and go around and see and ask you guys two things. So first is what's the coolest thing you've seen built so far on your platform or protocol in general? And then specifically, what's on your wish list for Ethf? What's one or two things that you really want someone to build coming out of this hackathon? So, coolest thing you've seen so far, just generally. And then for this hackathon, what do you want people to build? So maybe we could start with Nada.
00:44:17.114 - 00:45:16.578, Speaker F: Sure. So the coolest thing that I've seen is so you have to understand a little bit about how Dharma works in order to get this idea. But basically in Dharma there's this concept of what we call underwriters who basically kind of like attest to the credit worthiness of a borrower in any sort of given transaction. And so we had somebody at a hackathon once build a Game of Loans, as in a tongue in cheek play on Game of Thrones where essentially different underwriters compete over different loan offers and basically bid against each other. To have the right to underwrite that offer with their bid being the amount of money that they want to charge. And also, how good of a sort of credit rating will they give them? So I thought that was pretty interesting and just a really cool concept. As for what we'd love to see built, so again, Dharma is live.
00:45:16.578 - 00:45:40.860, Speaker F: We have great developer tooling, we have great developer documentation, it's really easy to use. And one thing that we really want to see happen is people build a margin lending interface for Auger prediction market shares just because I think it's like a big missing piece in the Auger system and our two systems would slot together really neatly. So I'd love to see that built.
00:45:41.390 - 00:45:42.330, Speaker B: Sweet.
00:45:43.870 - 00:46:56.526, Speaker C: The two coolest projects that I've seen built on top of Dai are sitting to my left and right. Zero X has created this explosion of decentralized exchanges and there's just no doubt that Dai is the most common quote currency on every single one of them. And in fact, the vast majority of volume, I think you might agree, is traded against Dai on all these different DEXes and on the other side, Dharma, which is like a completely different approach to lending and borrowing. A lot of times Dai is either used as collateral or it's lent out. And so this kind of just goes to show you that all the work that we put in to our project just got us all onto this stage here sitting right next to each other. So the other question, which is what I would like to see here at ETH SF is actually liquidity analysis. So liquidity is this very interesting mirage kind of concept in crypto networks in the trading of cryptocurrencies because due to many reasons, all kinds of crazy wash trading and speculation and all these different exchanges and it's very difficult to get a sense of what's real and what's fake.
00:46:56.526 - 00:48:00.118, Speaker C: And so we have a huge need at Maker to do this liquidity analysis and so we are planning a really sophisticated sort of strategy about how to discern what is real and fake liquidity. But I think that it could be a really interesting hack here at the conference and just to kind of make it a little bit more accessible and bite size, the thing that I would like to see is somebody take coin market cap data and then just subtract, figure out a way to figure out who's. Just like a long term cold storage holdaler. And then figure out what's the float? What's the actual trading float of these cryptocurrencies? And then say, okay, what's the real market cap? Because we've got the float and then we've got the price, and then we can see what is the actual real market cap of people who are trading this and just kind of discount the long term holders because they're just like a completely different class of trader or investor. And when they take their stuff out of cold storage, that's when it becomes sort of part of the market cap because it can affect the actual price. So if anybody wants to do that, you'll become my best friend. I'll give you any prize you want.
00:48:00.118 - 00:48:13.530, Speaker C: And it's really something because Coin market cap and the crazy, crazy market cap valuations that we see on Coin market Cap are just fake news. They're not real in any way. So I want to know what is the real market cap of these assets?
00:48:18.190 - 00:49:18.800, Speaker D: So I think a lot of the relayers, it would be foolish of me not to say that they're like building the coolest things on top of zero X, but maybe the less traditional use case for zero X that I thought was really interesting. So I don't know if people here are like, if they've looked on Etherscan and they just have tons of these crappy tokens that have just been airdropped on them without like, you don't want them, but they just were sent to you. So this project called Open Relay, what they did is they did an AirDrop, but they use zero X in order to make it something that you have to opt into. And so what they did is they created a zero X order specifically for every single account on Ethereum. So, like 30 million zero X orders, and people could go and fill them if they wanted to participate in the AirDrop. And if they didn't, then they didn't get the tokens in their wallet. So I thought that was pretty clever and it was pretty fun to see.
00:49:18.800 - 00:50:12.190, Speaker D: As far as a use case that we're really excited to see at the hackathon, there was a team that I talked to yesterday that was doing something pretty cool. They want to use Auger plus zero X to create prediction markets, but very specifically focused on synthetic stocks. So it's kind of shitty. If you're not in the United States, you're not able to access a lot of the publicly traded companies that are here, which know traditionally done very well. So companies like Google or Apple or Tesla, it's very hard to access these things if you're not a US. Citizen. So if they're able to create essentially like a synthetic version of these assets that are globally accessible, I think that would be really powerful and potentially kind of serve as an equalizing force.
00:50:12.190 - 00:50:16.420, Speaker D: So I think that's pretty exciting, and I want to see how it turns out.
00:50:17.830 - 00:50:56.574, Speaker E: So it's been about a week since Compound launched. And so far, the most interesting things built on top of our system are actually informational dashboards. We built one public informational dashboard. We've had two developers launch really interesting dashboards on top that analyze the markets and the liquidity and the health of the different assets. And so that's been the most interesting thing so far. The simplest thing that I would love to see built at San Francisco is something that borrows from compound and immediately trades using Kyber or Zero X or any other trading protocol. So one click being able to short sell an asset, or one click being able to margin long an asset should be relatively easy to do.
00:50:56.574 - 00:50:59.146, Speaker E: If you have any questions, talk to me afterwards.
00:50:59.338 - 00:51:45.526, Speaker B: Awesome, thank you. And coming from the wallet perspective, and from a mobile wallet perspective, I can tell you that we've loved seeing the first era of DApps, where the full force of what the protocol enabled was made available. But what really will take off, we feel what will really take off is when you have really simple one or two click DApps that let you achieve what the user's goal is in just a couple of clicks. And I think compound achieved that with your first goal. I was able to invest my money really quickly. dYdX, they did it with expo. And so if anyone is trying to build on top of protocols, if you can build something that lets the user get to their destination in just a couple of clicks in a really simple mobile interface, I think that's going to be a real winner.
00:51:45.526 - 00:51:52.320, Speaker B: So with that, I think we're almost out of time. If there's any questions from the audience, we're happy to take them.
00:51:56.500 - 00:51:58.290, Speaker E: No questions. Come on, guys.
00:52:01.060 - 00:52:16.644, Speaker B: That'S fine. We're all going to be around. You can come and talk to us. We're happy to talk to you if you're building any DApps or if you just want to discuss decentralized finance and what we've been building and what you've been building. Thank you so much, guys. This has been amazing. Thanks for joining us and everyone have a great day.
00:52:16.644 - 00:52:17.510, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:52:19.400 - 00:52:22.250, Speaker E: Thank no.
