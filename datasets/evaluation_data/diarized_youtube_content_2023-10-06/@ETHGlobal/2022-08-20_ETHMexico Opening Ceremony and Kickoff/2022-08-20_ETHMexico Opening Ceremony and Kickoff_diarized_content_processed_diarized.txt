00:32:30.696 - 00:32:58.388, Speaker C: These events are organized by ETH global. And our mission is very simple. We want to onboard thousands of developers into the web3 ecosystem. This is a hackathon. We believe this is a place for you to build things and show and learn and get better at what you are excited about. And we really want to make sure that you are showing instead of talking about what you're doing, because these are the values we admire the most.
00:32:58.554 - 00:33:12.560, Speaker A: See as soon hackathon Ellen FOC is in construir in the fundamental de los eventos de I global SK s MAS importante de Monstra k de sierra.
00:33:12.740 - 00:33:15.150, Speaker C: And we've done this around the world.

It's a small venue, it's a private event. Want to make sure that you have your badges and wristbands at all times.
00:35:45.120 - 00:36:17.700, Speaker A: And simply put, see ikea rapidir polasturas akitaner laposera el bracelete laposera no ASSESSO akitaneva adar silo peres asique Notelo Pierre, las recommenda desde lasocho asellasoco no estar afore de la vendo aquestar alendro lejos de la vendo recommendation.
00:36:19.480 - 00:36:36.670, Speaker C: Because we're on a busy street, just let's keep in mind that we're not hanging outside in Masses after 08:00 p.m.. And just make sure that we're not loitering. And of course, in case something goes wrong in a medical emergency, we also have an ambulance waiting outside, so we'll be here throughout the weekend. So if you need any assistance, please let us know.
00:36:37.600 - 00:36:43.180, Speaker A: Bueno I'm MAPOS de este lugar portoro. Portoro and los Pacios.
00:36:48.100 - 00:37:11.176, Speaker C: We're not going to go through the map, but it's posted all on the walls and there's a lot of activities happening today and tomorrow. So we have an NFT exhibition created by a noun style amigos. It's all the way at the end on the hallway. Please check that out. We have a digital photo booth. You can take photos and get selfies with you and yourself with the team. We can also play foosball right next to the Nouns Fair.
00:37:11.176 - 00:37:31.964, Speaker C: There's also a little carnival setting here and you can also learn how to do art beating tomorrow upstairs in the Build a hacking space at 03:00 P.m.. All of that is on the website schedule. But before we go into all those details, let's talk about communication. Everything we're going to be doing officially is going to be on discord. See?
00:37:32.002 - 00:37:44.220, Speaker A: IK unirselopontocom diagonal discord mesargo filamental I canales privaras.
00:38:07.500 - 00:38:11.992, Speaker C: I think what Evan said was, you're in person, talk to each other, something like that.
00:38:12.126 - 00:38:13.064, Speaker A: I see.
00:38:13.262 - 00:38:27.360, Speaker C: All right, looks like we're having some minor live stream stream related things, so we're just going to take 5 seconds and quickly adjust that. So whenever I get the heads up, let me know. I'll make the correction, but please give a thumbs up and we'll go back on schedule.
00:38:28.740 - 00:38:43.360, Speaker A: You got any jokes in the meantime? I don't know any jokes in Spanish. Ah, yeah, I don't know any jokes in English either.
00:39:35.470 - 00:39:38.220, Speaker C: Did that work? Can I get a thumbs up or down?
00:39:42.720 - 00:39:45.348, Speaker A: I am classic on a stick on manana.
00:39:45.384 - 00:40:19.810, Speaker C: Well, in the meantime, you can go to a discord. If you're not there, it'll take 30 seconds to get signed in. All right, we are good to go. Cool. And to repeat the same thing, every announcement we make, which is whether it's about the food, the prizes, any messages if something changes or anything is for things that are also on track. All these will be announcements on discord. And we're also going to send you some calendar invites so you know when submissions are, when judging is, and all the important stuff that's also on the website.
00:40:21.300 - 00:40:26.690, Speaker A: Sila Henda ESTA in Mexico, punto ETH global punto.com.
00:40:29.460 - 00:40:39.444, Speaker C: That's where everything is. All right? So we're going to spend ten minutes on the logistics of how the hackathon works. So the most important piece is hacking officially begins now and you can start.
00:40:39.482 - 00:40:48.180, Speaker A: Working on your projects, commensar de sero de la nada.
00:40:48.260 - 00:40:52.010, Speaker C: And you can work on a project with up to five members or also on your own.
00:40:52.620 - 00:40:55.800, Speaker A: Carlquipo Pere, TENERA asta single personas.
00:40:58.560 - 00:41:04.488, Speaker C: And from here, you have 36 hours to hack, which means submissions are due at 09:00 A.m. On Sunday.
00:41:04.584 - 00:41:12.140, Speaker A: Trenta says, oras asta el Domingo alamaniana alas nuev alas Noeve. Alas Noeve.
00:41:14.100 - 00:41:42.728, Speaker C: We're going to debug this again because it looks like the issue was not fixed. But in the meantime, the next slide says how all of this works, so we'll still get to this. Everything that you're going to be working on today must be done from scratch. There we go. Thank you. Moaz. Everything you're going to be submitting today should be done from scratch, which means you cannot work on a pre existing project.
00:41:42.728 - 00:41:44.650, Speaker C: You must start everything today.
00:41:46.800 - 00:41:48.270, Speaker A: I already said that.
00:41:50.640 - 00:41:59.848, Speaker C: This is lack of coordination and to win any prizes, you and all of your team members must be officially listed on your dashboard.
00:41:59.944 - 00:42:04.156, Speaker A: See IK star rehistrado para ganar unpremo.
00:42:04.268 - 00:42:10.800, Speaker C: And if you have any questions about something not being clear or if you're having technical issues, please find us and ask us so we can help fix this.
00:42:10.870 - 00:42:13.948, Speaker A: Quaquia pregunta a cartec?
00:42:14.124 - 00:42:37.080, Speaker C: Yes, me personally. And we have a lot of workshops and talks. A few of them already started today, a few of them will be after we get off stage. But make sure that if you're interested in learning more about any technical topic, you are here in this main hall. That's where all the talks are happening. And even if you are tired or you want to catch up on something because you missed it, it will also be recorded and you can watch it instantly on YouTube.
00:42:37.660 - 00:42:44.890, Speaker A: Sitolovastar gravado e transventiro torosta ian lahenda Mexico Pondo.com.
00:43:10.680 - 00:43:27.140, Speaker C: And even if you missed that, you can go back to your dashboard and use the Find a Team feature and meet other members who are looking to join a team or are looking to add others to their team. And the most important piece is submissions are due at 09:00 a.m.. Do not forget this deadline.
00:43:27.300 - 00:44:04.920, Speaker A: Nueva manana el domingo bueno el proseon adosan alaves al mismo momento la vallecion de avento Salvoke, los patrocina Dorres tambien pas and la mismo pero tenesque IR fijarte Dondestan toros patrocina dores and k desiske parasus premieres.
00:44:11.420 - 00:44:40.516, Speaker C: So there's going to be two streams of judging, all at the same time. There's a main judging, and for prizes happening with the sponsors, they both happen at the same time. So I have to figure out how to coordinate all of this in parallel and we'll get there in a second. So for the main judging, you have four minutes to demo and we recommend that you record a video of your project so that in case something goes wrong with live demo, you can still show what you built. And we recommend you do not do this thing last minute and keep at least an hour to work on all of this.
00:44:40.538 - 00:45:02.040, Speaker A: For your submissions, see revidimolque I quadra menundos paralla de masracion recommend grabaro video parano problemas porestai la stages in el dashboard.
00:45:02.620 - 00:45:30.544, Speaker C: And for the sponsor judging, when you are submitting your project, you'll get to choose which prize you are going for. Make sure you select it, otherwise there's no way for us or the sponsors to know which prize they need to look at. So do this immediately as part of the submission. And when judging starts, you have to go find that sponsor at their table inside the main building and present them the demo. So you can do this thing before your main judging or after, but it all's happening at the same time, see.
00:45:30.582 - 00:45:42.800, Speaker A: May I be slides premieres ono.
00:45:51.980 - 00:46:08.240, Speaker C: And in terms of how to behave over this weekend. Our code of conduct is very simple. You can hear the full rules and criteria for being a hacker and the code of conduct by going to Ethglobal.com rules. But in summary, please be respectful and harassment and abuse will not be tolerated in any form.
00:46:08.390 - 00:46:32.400, Speaker A: Silas estan and east global pundocom diagonal roles bueno ketolos estan mois respectosos no creo peregual elacoso ilabuso Novana star tolerato pananara el mismo de k ono kirajura.
00:46:37.260 - 00:46:54.060, Speaker C: Yes. Find me if you have any questions. And next up, what we want to do is bring on some of our amazing partners to come here and tell us who they are and why they're excited to be part of ETH Mexico. So without further ado, I'd like to welcome Stani from Ave and Lens to be on stage.
00:46:59.140 - 00:47:47.970, Speaker B: GM super excited to be here and amazing amount of people. It's definitely incredible weekend going to be. And those of you who are new to the Ethereum community, welcome. This is probably one of the best ways to start your journey. So I'm from Ave and the Ave team has built the Ave Protocol, which is a decentralized finance protocol where you can supply cryptographic assets and earn interest and use those assets as a collateral to borrow liquidity. And it's one of the biggest protocols out there. And also we built Lens protocol, which is a decentralized social media protocol, which you can pretty much integrate to any application.
00:47:47.970 - 00:48:30.268, Speaker B: Yeah, for today, we have some interesting bounties for everyone who is hacking on Lens protocol. So we want to see a lot of creativity during this hackathon. So we have a track for audio implementation. So we have the first price of $4,000 stablecoins, and second price is $1,500. So we're looking some interesting use cases that could empower music creators and also music curators as well. We also have a category of content discovery. So first price is 4002nd, price is 1500.
00:48:30.268 - 00:49:34.240, Speaker B: And this can be, for example, finding curators or creating leaderboards or some very interesting ways of discovering content. And of course we have a photo sharing, 4000 for first price, 1500 for the second price. And the idea is that you can create some interesting use case for photo sharing and hopefully include the audience as well. And anyone who integrates the Lens protocol gets automatically $100. So that's something you should definitely be doing. Yeah, and also it has a dispatcher, so essentially that means gasless and signless transactions and that's super amazing. Yeah, one thing is then on the Ave side, so we have grants sponsored by the Ave grants dow essentially first price is 9002nd, price is five and a half, and third, 4000, and the last one is 1500 for the fourth price.
00:49:34.240 - 00:50:13.992, Speaker B: So this is where the creativity comes into a play. Find an interesting way to integrate the Ave Protocol or build something very fascinating on top, something that might empower the DeFi ecosystem or anyone beyond like BFI can be something new that we haven't seen before. So we're looking a lot of creativity. And also we appreciate applications that are incredibly well designed. So go creative and go crazy and just let everything out, and that's it. And enjoy the hackathon and have fun. And remember, it's not a competition.
00:50:13.992 - 00:50:22.290, Speaker B: It's a place to make most out of your time and find new friends and collaborate. Thank you.
00:50:29.960 - 00:50:37.700, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Stani. Next up, we have Steph and Alex from Polygon. Please welcome them on stage.
00:50:45.560 - 00:50:46.356, Speaker D: Hey, everyone.
00:50:46.458 - 00:50:48.580, Speaker E: GM. GM. I'm Steph.
00:50:51.160 - 00:50:53.648, Speaker A: Alex gamis the polygon.
00:50:53.824 - 00:50:54.550, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:50:55.640 - 00:51:06.810, Speaker E: So, again, good morning. So excited to be with you all here at East Mexico. Again, we're both from Polygon, and Polygon is Ethereum's leading decentralized scaling platform.
00:51:07.340 - 00:51:14.284, Speaker A: Polygon is La Plata forma decentralizada para, Ethereum leader and el mundo. Awesome.
00:51:14.402 - 00:51:22.284, Speaker E: So we have lots of different scaling solutions, but this weekend, we're asking you to hack on Polygon POS, which is our proof of stake.
00:51:22.332 - 00:51:29.932, Speaker A: Blockchain is a technology upper ethereum polygon.
00:51:29.996 - 00:51:34.928, Speaker C: Proof of stake. Proof of stake, yeah.
00:51:35.014 - 00:51:52.340, Speaker E: So some of the benefits for building on top of Polygon are that if you're already an Ethereum developer amazing. You're also a polygon developer. You can use all of the same tools and languages that you're used to. It all works exactly the same. Except you just connect to either our main net or our Mumbai testnet.
00:51:54.120 - 00:52:13.900, Speaker A: Polygon ethereum musa solidity USAS ramentas ethereum e tenemostanto tantonostromainet principal como untestnet in Mumbai.
00:52:19.730 - 00:52:29.826, Speaker E: You also get all of the security of ethereum plus the scalability of polygon with low cost transaction fees and gas and really fast transactions which I love.
00:52:29.848 - 00:52:44.520, Speaker A: When I'm building compolegon tiannto las ventejas the lascalavilida ethereum gas fees muchomas bacos I una velocira transaction as much.
00:52:46.890 - 00:52:59.340, Speaker E: Great. So we have $12,000 in USDC in Polygon prizes this weekend. We have four different prize categories or problem statements that we're asking you to hack on.
00:53:04.430 - 00:53:38.600, Speaker A: In USDC. And stablecoines. La Primeras the Viennes Publicos Viennes publicos gobierno otras mejoras impactos. La Segunda is finance refi. La Tercera is cuegos of metaverse e. La Quarta is experienced on boarding lucios at web3.
00:53:38.970 - 00:53:55.150, Speaker E: Great. So we have broader explanations of these four problem statements on the ETH Global website, so check that out. But we're really looking for you to solve problems in these spaces, not just Chase bounties, but we will have multiple prizes per problem statement.
00:54:00.050 - 00:54:07.950, Speaker A: The eight global eotraves dentrodes premiers dentro de la mimilas categoria synthesis.
00:54:13.830 - 00:54:18.942, Speaker E: And we'll be here all weekend, so come visit us in our booth and we're all going to make it on Polygon.
00:54:19.006 - 00:54:19.394, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:54:19.432 - 00:54:24.290, Speaker A: Lamasarakito el fin semana gracias.
00:54:28.330 - 00:54:35.130, Speaker C: Thank you, Alex and Steph. All right, next up, we have Sebastian from Wallet Connect. Please give a big round of applause for Sebastian.
00:54:39.230 - 00:54:40.026, Speaker F: Hi, everyone.
00:54:40.128 - 00:54:41.130, Speaker D: Olatos.
00:54:43.790 - 00:55:29.690, Speaker F: Walletconnect is protocolo. Sorry, I can speak both English and Spanish, so I kind of got confused. So Wallconnect is a remote secure signing protocol, and basically what that gives you is the opportunity to have with your wallet and interact with the DApps in a secure manner. Wall Connection Protocolo the communication entrepreneurs, web parapermitter Interactor's, web cinternet k exponential problem. Most likely you have used Wallet Connect with this QR code which allows you to you've probably seen that the QR code with the web3 models.
00:55:33.710 - 00:55:34.074, Speaker C: We.
00:55:34.112 - 00:56:25.450, Speaker F: Have lots we've been growing ecosystem like we have lots of more. DApps just keeps using us. We're like one of the default options besides MetaMask. Just recently we just launched version two of Wallet Connect. Right now we are trying to target for four different products. But right now for this hackathon only the sign API is working. So what this means is that it's the same feature as the version one, Wallet Connect, where you can just do remote signing of transactions.
00:56:25.450 - 00:57:22.350, Speaker F: But the biggest difference is that it's a revamped API and you can have wildconnect multiplexing, I mean WebSocket multiplexing. So that means that with one WebSocket you can establish multiple sessions and it's also multi chain. So basically we are using chain agnostic improvement proposals to have multi chain capabilities. Acocol and Samos la vercion dosa Tina Capacia de multicarena. For this hackathon, we have two tracks. We have the version one track. And if you want to get a DAP working, I recommend that you just focus on using the version one of Wallconnect.
00:57:22.350 - 00:58:09.150, Speaker F: Basically, if you want to have a DAP, use version one. If you want to figure out some bugs or issues with version two or try to do some inter MultiChain apps, I recommend that you use Wall Connect version two. Although you're likely going to bump into some issues with Wallet Connect version two. Enthusiasm have a workshop at 10:00 p.m. And I can give you more details about what are we looking for in the prices.
00:58:09.730 - 00:58:10.190, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:10.260 - 00:58:12.000, Speaker F: And that's it. Thank you very much.
00:58:16.930 - 00:58:28.930, Speaker C: Thank you, Sebastian. I know it's not easy to do back and forth in two languages. I definitely can't. But I really appreciate you going through everything. Next up, we have Miguel to talk about WorldCoin. Please welcome Miguel on stage.
00:58:35.130 - 00:58:51.690, Speaker B: Going to leave this here because otherwise they have no hands. Yeah. Guillerm. Buenos Diaz. I'm not going to the whole back and forth thing, but if you want to hear this in Spanish, you can come to our booth after. And some of us speak Spanish, so it should be fine. Yeah.
00:58:51.690 - 00:59:46.458, Speaker B: We are super excited to be here as part of our incentive to open source the protocol decentralize. And I just thought I would talk a little bit about what exactly we're solving. So there's this thing called civil attacks, which is when some person pretends to be multiple persons, multiple people. And this really begs you for things like social, curation, airdrops, NFTs, pretty much anything where you would expect people to be actually people. And when building a protocol that allows you to say, I'm a real person and I have never done something like voting, minting all of these things in a completely anonymous way. It's called Wall ID and that transition should not be there, but it is a protocol to anonymously verify that someone is a human that has never done something before. So especially now with recent events, we know how important it is to have privacy and to have privacy by default.
00:59:46.458 - 01:00:40.190, Speaker B: And we are kind of building the civil assistance, the entity layer that actually has it from scratch. And so again you can say I have never bought it on this poll without revealing any other information about you that works thanks to that thing the orb. Sorry, that thing which makes sure that you're a real human and then gives you key that you can use to generate serialized proofs that any application can then verify both on and off chain with an API. Yeah, the setup is really simple. Any user can verify through the orb. Then projects will request using a QR code similar to Wallconnect, actually powered by them, which will show a prompt in the Wallcoin app saying do you want to verify this? And that will take care of generating the proof, sending it to the app. You can then send it on saying basically all of the hard stuff is taken care of for you.
01:00:40.190 - 01:01:12.582, Speaker B: This is kind of all of that you need to get set up. This will show them all, this will do everything. And now for the first time, we also have a full react version of that. So if you're building with react it is this easy and basically this shows this kind of captcha that allows people to click in and verify it with basically no user friction. So if you have any kind of website, you just saw this prompt there in the background. It's our lens integration which is pretty recent. And then the user would just take off the phone, scan the QR and boom.
01:01:12.582 - 01:01:25.978, Speaker B: They can verify that they're human, completely trustedly on chain. This has lots and lots of use cases. You can use it for quadratic voting funding. NFT means social incentives, all of these really cool things and we're excited to.
01:01:25.984 - 01:01:27.040, Speaker C: See what you can make.
01:01:28.050 - 01:01:49.880, Speaker B: We have our own Discord Discordug wallcoin where we can give you feedback and we'll also be at the Global Discord and on our booth and around. So if you need any feedback at all, feel free to ask. We have also put together a list of resources, starter kits, documentation, everything is at Slash, Mexico. And yeah, let's build together. Excited to see what you make.
01:01:55.290 - 01:02:07.340, Speaker C: Thank you so much. And next up we have IPFS and Filecoin. Unfortunately they're not here in person yet, so they recorded a video for us. We're just going to play the video for all of you to learn about who they are and what you can win.
01:02:16.660 - 01:03:10.944, Speaker G: Hey everyone, my name is Carlene, I'm on the ecosystem growth team with IPFS and Filecoin welcome to ETH, Mexico. We're thrilled to support another event organized by ETH Global, and I'm excited to be kicking off this event with you today. Now, let's briefly talk about what we're excited about. IPFS is the peer to peer protocol, replacing the centralized architecture of today's Internet, making the web upgradable, resilient and more open. And Filecoin is the largest storage network built on top of IPFS that ensures content persistence over time. And with storage helpers like NFT Storage, Filecoin is becoming Web three's infrastructure layer for NFTs, which many of you will be using to build your projects. Does your project have a unique or significant use case for IPFS and Filecoin? Well, we'd love to see that.
01:03:10.944 - 01:03:48.670, Speaker G: We invite you to visit the event site or scan the QR code to check out our challenge statements and prizes for inspiration. We've got $20,000 up for grabs. We've also provided some great learning resources to get you started with IPFS and Filecoin in literally minutes. We've got an amazing workshop on IPFS and Filecoin that you're not going to want to miss. Also, we hope you stay in touch with us. We're available on Discord and you can also book office hours with our devs to get your questions answered. Submit your amazing projects to win a prize, and most of all, have fun.
01:03:48.670 - 01:04:05.990, Speaker G: We hope that you enjoy the experience. You're in Mexico after all, build really cool things and make new friends. I'm excited to see how you help us make the Internet better. Now go forth and happy building amazing.
01:04:07.960 - 01:04:08.950, Speaker D: Hey everyone.
01:04:10.440 - 01:04:30.140, Speaker C: There we go. And those were just some of our partners. But before we go to our keynote talk, I want to talk about all the prizes you can win.

So in total, there's $150,000 of prizes and all those details are listed on this website. I think they got that one without all right, on to our amazing keynote talk. Without further ado, I'd like to welcome Aya Miyakuchi, who's the executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, to talk about why Latin America matters to us. And we're also going to be bringing on Juan David Reyes to translate this live in Spanish. So please give them a big round of applause.
01:08:51.250 - 01:09:16.820, Speaker D: Hello, everyone. Great to be here at this first East scrollball hackathon in Mexico, am I right? And at this very beautiful. It's very, very exciting. And I also tweeted about this this morning that I discovered merge is happening on Mexico's Independence Day.
01:09:17.470 - 01:09:18.220, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:21.390 - 01:09:23.530, Speaker D: Probably mostly.
01:09:31.390 - 01:09:39.130, Speaker H: The as same the result as a. Tweet case. Okay bombs as a merch el kinse september kecoin sierra con line Dependency.
01:09:45.190 - 01:10:07.594, Speaker D: So today I'd like to talk about what kind of organization the Ethereum Foundation needs. And before that, I'm going to talk about a little bit about myself. Just a heads up anyone who listened to my talk last week. The first half of my talk is almost the same, but I'm going to talk a little bit more about go.
01:10:07.632 - 01:10:08.220, Speaker A: To.
01:10:14.990 - 01:10:16.730, Speaker H: Isola pasa.
01:10:18.910 - 01:11:10.998, Speaker D: So my background when I first started my career in Japan, I was a teacher. And I always believed in the power of education. I still believe in the power of education. I think education is everything and the knowledge and access to information can lead to reshaping the future of the society and the world. And I also taught my students the importance of learning about diverse different cultures and also views. Then I moved to San Francisco and discovered crypto. That was around the time I was focusing on financial inclusion or microfinance during my MBA.
01:11:10.998 - 01:12:05.262, Speaker D: So I got fascinated with the possibilities that this technology could build better financial inclusion and development of new economies with more open access. This to everyone. Then I joined Kraken as one of the few earliest members of the team working at Kraken. This was a while ago. I met a young Vitalik who is coming very soon here. He was working on a new idea that can include what crypto and blockchain can do. Later we learned more about this idea.
01:12:05.262 - 01:12:14.560, Speaker D: And I was excited because this idea could increase the potential in things like financial inclusion 100 times more.
01:12:18.930 - 01:12:20.510, Speaker H: Accesso alas finances.
01:12:22.070 - 01:12:42.410, Speaker D: And yes, the idea was Ethereum eli. And later, when I left my previous work, vitalik and others asked me to join EF to help. And I did. Back then, the EF was just a hub for devs and researchers focusing on building the platform of Ethereum.
01:12:48.270 - 01:12:50.330, Speaker H: Group investigators.
01:12:53.010 - 01:12:59.802, Speaker D: And Ethereum was already pretty big. The ecosystem was pretty big. And I needed to redesign the roles.
01:12:59.866 - 01:13:08.130, Speaker H: Of Ethereum Foundation and as momentoke reorganizer Alguno role as De La Foundation first.
01:13:08.200 - 01:14:25.050, Speaker D: There were already many contributors to Ethereum outside of the Ethereum Foundation because it's an open source project and there was no good support mechanism to support those contributors in the community. So one clear thing that I needed to do is to add grant giving function to the Ethan Foundation. And today we do more comprehensive work than just giving grants. I will explain part of it today, but we do what's best for Ethereum healthy Ecosystem long term ethereum by healthy I mean both physically and culturally. Every good idea has trade offs, just like Ethereum's Thailand MERS we sometimes have to sacrifice short term advantage to achieve long term goals. But we believe that that is one of the virtue that Ethereum Ecosystem has and that is tied to the soul of Ethereum.
01:14:30.190 - 01:14:33.930, Speaker H: Estamicion comoprehemplo PENSAR elargo plazoke.
01:14:36.050 - 01:15:39.490, Speaker D: And within the EF, my most important role is to keep the soul of the Ethereum Foundation so that EF can help the community keep the soul of Ethereum. Para continuad I envision the future when our society will have systems that are more inclusive and open, so every single person has opportunities and access to be part of solutions. I believe Ethereum can help build this future and that is the source of my motivation and also all of us at the Ethereum Foundation. So what is the Ethereum Foundation? EF exists to support things around the Ethereum technology and also the ecosystem. EF is very unique organization. We are not just a normal nonprofit or company. Why do we have to be unique as a organization?
01:15:41.670 - 01:15:47.930, Speaker H: Una nonprofit sinokatine autosophetios we believe ECM.
01:15:48.030 - 01:16:09.020, Speaker D: Is a protocol for human coordination that is supported by many great minds. It is not just money, it is not just technology. It is a protocol for human coordination so that it can enable humans to coordinate better with more inclusiveness, transparency and security.
01:16:09.390 - 01:16:22.650, Speaker H: Asika Ethereum protocol desert group of personas principal the inclusivity transparency.
01:16:23.510 - 01:17:09.840, Speaker D: So while Ethereum brings new views in human coordination, we learn that it requires new type of definitions and approaches. And just like Ethereum, Ethereum Foundation had to create a new type of collaboration system so that we can flexibly support this unique ecosystem. So instead of being a normal organization, we are like a community of teams. A community of teams that help coordinate many things, projects, people, teams, businesses and schools that are building, developing researches and spreading the knowledge of Ethereum technology.
01:17:10.290 - 01:17:19.490, Speaker H: As I parasarona organization negotiates esquelas estudiantes NST animos.
01:17:21.750 - 01:17:27.574, Speaker D: We do not just allocate resources, we coordinate activities, discussions, knowledge and.
01:17:27.612 - 01:17:35.750, Speaker H: Education in the ecosystem, asikenosolo say dan precursor according to establish.
01:17:36.650 - 01:17:42.666, Speaker D: So because of these teams in the EF community are very aligned in the.
01:17:42.688 - 01:17:52.430, Speaker H: Mission, but loosely coupled asika paracontino como des membrane.
01:17:53.170 - 01:18:08.526, Speaker D: And this structure allows us to adapt to ever changing conditions around ethium, as you know, more easily. Also lets us distribute power to support more organic growth.
01:18:08.718 - 01:18:16.390, Speaker H: As I casta structuranos permit distributor mass efficient.
01:18:17.130 - 01:18:30.890, Speaker D: We have ongoing development teams working on long term projects like these consensus ID, gas, solid, et cetera. And they usually have a lot of independence.
01:18:35.230 - 01:18:36.250, Speaker H: Independence.
01:18:37.150 - 01:19:11.670, Speaker D: We also have the ecosystem development cluster to support other things in the ecosystem. Teams on this side are not developing specific things, but finding ways to better support the ecosystem with a bigger picture. So their roles include building the relationship allocating funds, facilitating education and spotting risk.
01:19:12.250 - 01:19:25.466, Speaker H: As you can estepanoramo grande constraint relaciones alo Carvo inverted fundos facilitator ladocaccion e descuria potential examples of those teams are.

01:19:42.468 - 01:20:17.594, Speaker D: Masquestanella lista and I said we are not a normal top down organization. In order for EF teams to support this unique and decentralized ecosystem effectively. They also need to act independently so that I don't go around tell people what to do every day. But they also need to act towards the same mission. I said our people are very mission oriented. How do we keep that mission? There are guiding principles that are key.
01:20:17.632 - 01:20:27.690, Speaker H: To the way we think and action. Conjunction de la qualtos.
01:20:29.570 - 01:20:55.426, Speaker D: First one is long term thinking. You may not see the impact of what we are doing today or even in a year. We believe our impact should be measured in decades and centuries. We need to think about the time when we are not here or not alive for the next generations to come. We take care of ethereum for the infinite term beyond our time asika premier.
01:20:55.458 - 01:21:12.750, Speaker H: Principio esamiento elargo plus nopensar in el manana paraquando and westen las personas programmers la cigientes principio sandando and next is subtraction.
01:21:13.170 - 01:21:51.258, Speaker D: We resist the natural tendency of organizations to accumulate prestige and power. Normally in an organization thinks about competition and how it can grow bigger. Instead, we push opportunities outwards. We are excited to see others succeed. We try to model less so that the ecosystem can thrive with or without the ethereum foundation in the long run. This was especially not easy at my earlier time. People wanted to give EF power and wanted us to control more.
01:21:51.258 - 01:22:04.670, Speaker D: But if you think about the world we are building I believe each potential big power has to subtract so things get decentralized and distributed.
01:22:05.090 - 01:22:25.230, Speaker H: As a kilogram, the principal dondela EF tiny porter caves menos e I much as a portonia el del camino pork importantes kela EF no concentrate centralisao.
01:22:25.390 - 01:22:34.710, Speaker D: This is a very important philosophy, but it's very hard to understand often. So we spend a lot of time and energy for new EF people to.
01:22:34.780 - 01:22:42.866, Speaker H: Understand this veil philosophy. Amid the fisil de communicar per sonas.
01:22:42.898 - 01:23:04.740, Speaker D: Luentian last one is stewardship of values. Like I said, ethereum has a soul. The values of our community are what made Ethereum what it is today. Values like open source decentralization, open access, privacy and many more. We care about nurturing the values that are most important for the community.
01:23:05.990 - 01:23:13.890, Speaker H: Este el Ultimas more importantes projectos open source decentralisidat.
01:23:15.930 - 01:23:54.660, Speaker D: So there are many other values that we have but these are the things that we stick to and then try to really keep in our community and also hopefully share these to other people in the community. But we also work with other community members, especially the one that we think that are closely aligned with our principles. East Global team, for example, is a great example of the team that are aligned with our principles. So thank you, East Global for kicking us all the time.
01:24:00.470 - 01:24:12.374, Speaker H: Over and los Principus e alama Comparti los Angeles Global los Principus k I just so this.
01:24:12.412 - 01:24:59.240, Speaker D: Leads to our vision of infinite garden. So we were talking this venue looks like a garden almost, but I'd like to explain this the garden of ecosystem where everyone lives in a healthy, sustainable environment in order to continue playing the game together instead of someone winning the game. I came up with the idea of infinite garden reading the Book Finite and Infinite Games by James Cars. I highly recommend to everyone I've been recommending to everyone and then it'll be very easy for you to understand.
01:25:01.370 - 01:25:07.800, Speaker H: Este there biennade la lecture infinite and Finite Games the James Cars recommend the much.
01:25:08.170 - 01:25:25.920, Speaker D: So with our principles we try to focus on what only EF can do. This ecosystem is growing, but we are more than happy if things go smoothly without our support. So we constantly have to ask ourselves what are the things that only EF can do?
01:25:34.230 - 01:25:36.210, Speaker H: Ethereum Foundation Device.
01:25:39.270 - 01:26:29.730, Speaker D: So words like crypto, blockchain, web3 or NFTs are widely known today. Helping others be mindful of the potential of Blockchain and Ethereum beyond cryptocurrencies or DeFi is one of the ideas that naturally occurred to me by asking that question what are the things that only EF can do? What are the things that are not happening yet? The team Next Billion was created so we can think deeply about the people and regions that will represent next billion users and builders of Ethereum, those who can benefit most from this protocol of human coordination.
01:26:36.310 - 01:26:43.074, Speaker H: Bijo and the personas consumers e credoris and one of the efforts.
01:26:43.122 - 01:27:08.458, Speaker D: The team is doing is the foundation fellowship program. When I suggested this idea, it was not really just about helping a few fellows, it was about getting their help to show their examples to others so that others can learn from or even copy. The first cohort focused on the change makers in the emerging economies asika respecta.

01:27:14.468 - 01:27:45.580, Speaker D: Technology there was a report quickly narrower on the sorry, the bottom left she is working on this project to connect schools with internet. And then Ethereum and Blockchain can help the coordination between government schools and the internet provider better. And even like they are actually bringing staking for the financial independence of the community too.

01:28:37.798 - 01:28:59.860, Speaker D: And Chewy on the top left is from Mexico. So I'm going to talk about him and his project after later. So let's first share the voice from these four people. We have a video here.
01:29:07.440 - 01:29:08.380, Speaker H: Laudio.
01:29:10.400 - 01:29:10.716, Speaker B: Try.
01:29:10.738 - 01:29:12.600, Speaker C: To fix something that is broken or corrupt.
01:29:12.680 - 01:29:14.812, Speaker B: We try to fix or at least.
01:29:14.866 - 01:29:35.972, Speaker C: Improve even at a very small level, how the public sector works. You can end up in improving the lives of many. You have said that with the concept of the next billion. So almost 600 million people in Latin America kind of fulfill that description of the next billion.
01:29:36.036 - 01:29:39.396, Speaker A: This really is key for Ethereum Foundation's.
01:29:39.428 - 01:29:40.980, Speaker D: Mission to reach the next billion.
01:29:41.060 - 01:29:43.416, Speaker A: Because in order to be part of.
01:29:43.438 - 01:29:45.336, Speaker D: This network, you first need to be.
01:29:45.358 - 01:30:32.968, Speaker A: Part of the digital economy and have access to the Internet. So it's really solving this first foundational challenge that we face where still over 600 million students and young people don't have access to to the Internet around the world, and in particular in sub Saharan Africa. We're in the very early stages of understanding how do we understand it and what benefit does BRAC get from using blockchain? Because BRAC inherently started as a core, a decentralized organization, units working in the field, solving problems where they are and kind of like solving problems in a decentralized manner. So it kind of made sense on a theoretical and a conceptual basis that we could use blockchain in our organization to good use.
01:30:33.054 - 01:31:12.260, Speaker I: The problem that I'm working on currently in EC Africa has been the claims been traditional insurance has had a lot of problems when it comes to claims payout. They would be delayed, number one, and they would also not be guaranteed because information trickled down was limited. So that has been the problem that we've been solving using blockchain technology smart contracts. They're able to quickly generate payout schedules now ensuring that we would know who needs to be paid how much. When quite fast.
01:31:12.410 - 01:31:28.792, Speaker C: Since 2014, more or less. I've been deep diving into what we call blockchain meets Coptic, which means how blockchain can serve as a government technology, working on how governments, how the public sector can meaningfully adopt blockchains.
01:31:28.856 - 01:31:41.068, Speaker I: I got to meet the other fellows doing awesome and wonderful things. We connect at different levels, discuss different things, especially on how to move our projects forward.
01:31:41.154 - 01:31:42.096, Speaker A: So at the end of the day.
01:31:42.118 - 01:31:43.648, Speaker D: The next billion are going to be.
01:31:43.734 - 01:31:57.012, Speaker A: New users that will make the network bigger. I think open source is the way to go. Blockchain is an open source solution. Ethereum is open source. And I think the solutions that we look at in terms of for the development sector should also be open.
01:31:57.066 - 01:31:58.980, Speaker C: And thank you for this beautiful conversation as well.
01:31:59.050 - 01:32:04.580, Speaker A: Very thankful and happy to be part of the fellowship. That's really exciting.
01:32:18.860 - 01:32:38.060, Speaker D: So speaking of next billion users and builders, let me talk about Latin America. In Latin America, many people are struggling to do better for its basic infrastructure and systems, including financial inclusion. But they also become a hub for talents and entrepreneurs.
01:32:40.480 - 01:32:43.660, Speaker H: Program and ex billion and el context Latin America.
01:32:46.500 - 01:33:04.804, Speaker D: For people in Latin America, blockchain is not just about money, not just about the technology, but about being sure tomorrow about protecting their wealth, fighting violations of human rights and redefining systems. They work and live in La.
01:33:04.842 - 01:33:05.430, Speaker H: Technology.
01:33:13.480 - 01:33:27.260, Speaker D: Ethereum provides tools to build your own solution. In Latin America, I can see people's motivation to build their own solution coming from their genuine passion to change their own life. And I think that's very powerful.
01:33:27.840 - 01:33:33.020, Speaker H: Ethereum prevail as opportunities paracre solutions parallel necessity.
01:33:36.980 - 01:33:59.370, Speaker D: In region where more people have smartphones than bank accounts, this technology represents an opportunity to improve regional financial inclusion. In Mexico, for example, this is a little bit old, but as of 2018, over 50% of people are unbanked and over 30% have no access to any financial product.
01:34:03.820 - 01:34:12.200, Speaker H: Asika smartphones queuentes bancarias iconsta Cifras pero iguan relevant.
01:34:15.200 - 01:34:36.770, Speaker D: And because of this, just 31% have access to credit products. And on the other hand, 60% of the population owns the farm. And because of this gap, there is tremendous amount of unmet demand and also opportunity.
01:34:37.940 - 01:34:46.000, Speaker H: Asika lao elaquission I santa percentas katien and smartphones asika una grandbra.
01:34:47.540 - 01:34:48.264, Speaker A: Thank.
01:34:48.422 - 01:35:34.500, Speaker D: This is exactly the reason why Chui from the fellowship program you just saw from Mexico decided to work on solutions for public sectors. He said it was natural for them to pick gobtech to work on in order to change their life. His team is spread in Mexico and oh, sorry, I skipped your transition. So his team is now working with states and cities in Mexico and Argentina with other blockchain startups to kickstart an ecosystem for governments. It's called Tango ID, which is a self surveying digital ID decentralized and permissionless.
01:35:39.880 - 01:35:43.504, Speaker H: In Argentina. In Mexico. Paracrearon systema dentia.
01:35:43.552 - 01:36:08.480, Speaker D: Soverana the goal is to support more accountable institutions and sustainable economic growth. Monterey City government in Mexico is working with the team. Monterey will be releasing the platform to connect your wallet with all different digital services and proceeds.
01:36:15.460 - 01:36:16.300, Speaker H: Publicos.
01:36:16.380 - 01:36:51.500, Speaker D: And in order for this plan to work, there needs to be a state law to make the blockchain digital ID as an official Identifier. So the effort is also moving forward too. So the stories like Chewies are why the Ethereum Foundation see strong opportunities. The opportunities for Ethereum's next billion builders and users to be born from Latin America. We have been supporting teams and projects in the region and will continue to do so so that you can join the infinite Garden.
01:36:57.200 - 01:36:58.316, Speaker H: De la Fundacion de.
01:36:58.338 - 01:37:50.224, Speaker D: Creir omejutura and outside of public sector, what seems to be important for this region is that Ethereum also creates job opportunities for creators and artists. The supply of NFT market has made artists become financially independent. When you think about NFTs, we hear big money making stories. But here in Latin America, and especially in Mexico, you can see it is not just about becoming financially independent. I have one personal story to share.
01:37:50.422 - 01:37:54.960, Speaker H: Asika paramustrales financial independent.
01:37:57.960 - 01:38:10.228, Speaker D: I spent some time in Mexico in 2020 actually, when it felt like the world was ending with the pandemic and people started to care more about things like privacy, censorship.
01:38:10.404 - 01:38:21.720, Speaker H: And also true informationes.
01:38:22.640 - 01:38:45.120, Speaker D: So during that time, Mexico actually showed me freedom and how to live in the darkness. This country also had Day of the Dead, so it is a spirit how to cope with the death. And the inspiration I received was mainly from artists.
01:38:45.940 - 01:38:47.010, Speaker H: As you can.
01:38:52.820 - 01:38:59.796, Speaker D: See, I visited Oajaca, Mexico and discovered this art by a.
01:38:59.818 - 01:39:07.060, Speaker H: Street artist yasca asika visito Oaxaca e descurio Esthertista Jexka.
01:39:07.820 - 01:39:19.870, Speaker D: I don't have to explain what it is, but as you can see, it is very powerful. And I felt immediate connection with what we are doing with web3 and his art.
01:39:22.160 - 01:39:29.344, Speaker H: Estima alinia Aloque estamos construed and then.
01:39:29.382 - 01:39:41.220, Speaker D: I just discovered now he and his friends created this streetlab IO, a decentralized organization that are governed by holders of the NFTs.
01:39:44.520 - 01:39:50.916, Speaker H: Streetlab IO con otos amigos akinestangan sus.
01:39:50.948 - 01:39:56.040, Speaker D: NFTs and then the NFTs are those faces of muertos.
01:39:57.820 - 01:40:00.120, Speaker H: NFTs cars.
01:40:01.360 - 01:40:17.970, Speaker D: And then I just found very beautiful story from here too. There are many street artists that are also an advocate or an activist. Their art can be politically controversial. An NFT means something else for them.
01:40:18.580 - 01:40:25.440, Speaker H: As you can control ungroup artistas activistas yelarte les permit.
01:40:27.160 - 01:40:39.268, Speaker D: I wanted to share their quotes from their website. NFTs is a path for these art to become eternal. They can be destroyed in real life. They will be forever.
01:40:39.364 - 01:40:44.840, Speaker H: Here on blockchain nasikaliskiro compartir una Fraser.
01:40:47.420 - 01:41:01.260, Speaker D: And Lakshin, the free Muertos stand for the freedom fighters coming back from the dead to guide the street arts toward the NFT scene, to echo their voices and fight censorship.
01:41:01.760 - 01:41:07.740, Speaker H: Asikolos NFT saluna former bevercient e Luciar contra.
01:41:09.920 - 01:41:50.856, Speaker D: Today? Yes supposed to be watching this live hola yes. And I was beyond excited to discover this, to see how Ethereum is enabling the artists that I'd admire to make his art more powerful. Okay, another example from Mexico, this artist ATRO Suniga cleans up streets and beaches and use garbage to create these art of scouts. And again, scouts represent important part of Mexican culture.
01:41:51.048 - 01:41:56.140, Speaker H: Asikaqui ayotro Mexico de one artista Citilisa Ellarte.
01:41:58.900 - 01:42:19.620, Speaker D: Use 3D photograph metery to digitize sculpture and mint it on NFC as an NFD on his him. He does this to bring awareness to the environmental issues. He says if we do not raise more awareness about the pollution in the world, we will end up like these skulls dead.

01:42:32.460 - 01:42:55.280, Speaker D: So naturally, Mexico has a strong growing NFD industry. According to Tech Insight 360s survey, the NFD industry in Mexico is expected to grow by 46.3% this year. Many artists also play a role of an advocate or an activist, like I said, and I'm fascinated with their creativity.

01:43:03.644 - 01:43:18.436, Speaker D: Ramientas Perlos activists and fleeter, carlo is one from Mexico that the world respects and admires. Imagine what she could have done even more if she had been empowered by Ethereum.
01:43:18.628 - 01:43:21.320, Speaker H: Frida Carlo is an artist representative.
01:43:27.920 - 01:43:33.740, Speaker D: Lastly, as you know, we are bringing DevCon six to Pogota, Colombia.
01:43:36.000 - 01:43:36.750, Speaker A: Who?
01:43:40.900 - 01:43:56.980, Speaker D: He's from Bogota, Colombia. And it is happening soon. In October, when we made this decision, I repeat this, we did not just pick Bogota or Colombia. We picked Latin America. With all the communities, including Mexico.
01:43:59.960 - 01:44:07.800, Speaker H: Colombia. Ikomaya repeated much as bestes no solo HiMOs Colombia, Sinoke Latin America entrejos amex.
01:44:15.200 - 01:44:24.496, Speaker D: So the Ethereum community in Mexico might be still new, but as you can see, there is a big opportunity because of the challenges and the creativity I.

01:44:35.324 - 01:44:51.304, Speaker D: So if you are here today to hack, you can be one to build a solution earlier than others. Whether by being part of ethereum's public good solutions such as protocol project or layer twos, or building an application for different sectors or being an artist to.

01:45:02.160 - 01:45:02.684, Speaker A: We are.
01:45:02.722 - 01:45:23.520, Speaker D: Here to support your journey. If you have questions about us, the Ethereum Foundation, our people are going to be at the desk in another room tomorrow from ten to 12:00 p.m., also three to 06:00 p.m., which is gracious.

01:45:46.060 - 01:46:29.268, Speaker C: Please give aya and Juan David a big round of applause. Thank you so much. I think what you'll see here for this weekend is also what this talk aimed to talk about, which is ethereum is more than just a currency. There is a lot more going on, not from just the technology side, but also from culture and community and what we all believe in to bring in thousands of people from so many different perspectives and things that they care about altogether from a shared mission. So thank you again and I know all of you have been here patient for a long time, so we'll keep this very quick last slide. We really want this weekend to be fun for you. So please pace yourself.
01:46:29.268 - 01:46:51.652, Speaker C: This is about learning and trying out new things. It's not meant to be a competition. We want you to have fun. We want you to become better at what you already knew this week as today and get more out of it two days from now. So please take your time. Get to know everybody else that's out here there are people from so many different parts of the world that care about so many different things. And with that, happy hacking.
01:46:51.652 - 01:46:52.150, Speaker C: Thanks everybody.
