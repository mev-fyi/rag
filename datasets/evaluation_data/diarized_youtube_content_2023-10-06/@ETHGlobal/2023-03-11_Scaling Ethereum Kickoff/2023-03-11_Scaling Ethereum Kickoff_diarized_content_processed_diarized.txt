00:00:06.250 - 00:00:09.066, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everybody. My name is Kartik.
00:00:09.098 - 00:00:13.374, Speaker B: I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global. And I'm super excited to welcome all.
00:00:13.412 - 00:00:18.826, Speaker A: Of you to Scaling Ethereum. All of you are watching this on ETHGlobal TV.
00:00:18.858 - 00:00:19.738, Speaker B: For those of you who are joining.
00:00:19.754 - 00:00:24.950, Speaker A: Us for the first time, this is the platform we'll be using for the rest of this month to host all.
00:00:24.980 - 00:00:26.754, Speaker B: Of our talks, workshops and summits.
00:00:26.882 - 00:00:32.950, Speaker A: And you're in for an amazing time learning about everything that's happening in the world of scaling Ethereum.
00:00:33.610 - 00:00:52.466, Speaker B: All right, let's get started. This hackathon is brought to you by ETH Global. ETH Global is an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the Web three ecosystem. And we do this by running two things hackathons and summits.
00:00:52.598 - 00:01:34.634, Speaker A: And scaling Ethereum is no different. We have an amazing next few weeks planned where we're going to host three summits, two of which I can talk about. The first one is a kickoff summit. You're going to learn about all the amazing things happening in the world of roll ups right after we cover the hackathon logistics. Then on March 24, the Friday, we're going to talk about what's happening in the world of Mev with the Flashbots Summit and a super secret announcement coming in on March 27, the Monday, a few days after the Flashbot Summits about something that this entire ecosystem has been eagerly waiting for.
00:01:34.832 - 00:01:40.218, Speaker B: We're going to release what those announcements are and what the summit and those speakers are very soon.
00:01:40.304 - 00:01:42.782, Speaker A: So stay tuned for the next few.
00:01:42.836 - 00:01:45.002, Speaker B: Weeks to learn about all the impressive.
00:01:45.146 - 00:01:48.622, Speaker A: Progress we've made as an industry in the last couple of years.
00:01:48.756 - 00:01:54.518, Speaker B: All of this will be on eGlobal TV. And today we have a summit that's.
00:01:54.554 - 00:02:03.810, Speaker A: Going to cover all the things that's going to set the theme for what everybody's doing to scale Ethereum. But the next 30 minutes are about the hackathon.
00:02:04.470 - 00:02:08.754, Speaker B: We have so much going on for this event and I want to make sure we take the time to talk.
00:02:08.792 - 00:02:12.406, Speaker A: About everything that we're going to do to structure the next few weeks for.
00:02:12.428 - 00:02:15.986, Speaker B: Us hackers and for those of you joining us, for the first time, telling.
00:02:16.018 - 00:02:18.102, Speaker A: You how everything works. For those of you who are coming.
00:02:18.156 - 00:02:20.738, Speaker B: Back, welcome back, and stay tuned for.
00:02:20.764 - 00:02:24.166, Speaker A: A few changes we've made to our previous formats.
00:02:24.358 - 00:02:27.210, Speaker B: So this is already an impressive and massive event.
00:02:27.280 - 00:02:34.734, Speaker A: We have over 1200 people from 89 different countries participating in working on projects related to Scaling Ethereum and building on.
00:02:34.772 - 00:02:40.734, Speaker B: L2 S. And they are from 24 time zones. We finally managed to cover all time.
00:02:40.772 - 00:02:43.006, Speaker A: Zones and I can't wait to meet.
00:02:43.028 - 00:02:46.480, Speaker B: All of you here and see what everybody's excited about.
00:02:46.870 - 00:02:48.306, Speaker A: Also, put everybody on a map to.
00:02:48.328 - 00:02:49.794, Speaker B: See where everybody was coming from and.
00:02:49.832 - 00:02:57.742, Speaker A: It just continues to blow us away because we have representation from six continents and so many cities around the world.
00:02:57.816 - 00:03:05.830, Speaker B: The last time counted this a few days ago, that number was closer to 500 unique cities. So that's awesome to see and welcome.
00:03:05.900 - 00:03:14.300, Speaker A: Everybody and thank you for staying up or staying late, early, everything from all these time zones, we really appreciate this.
00:03:15.150 - 00:03:18.586, Speaker B: Not only just that, we have 107 mentors who are going to be here.
00:03:18.688 - 00:03:27.246, Speaker A: Helping you over the next three weeks to make sure that your project comes to life and 19 amazing partners that.
00:03:27.268 - 00:03:30.974, Speaker B: Are giving out help, guidance, prizes and.
00:03:31.012 - 00:03:40.882, Speaker A: Mentorship to make sure that you succeed in building on top of Ethereum and layer twos. And they're also going to be giving.
00:03:40.936 - 00:03:45.058, Speaker B: Out over $200,000 worth of prizes. So there's a lot of prizes that.
00:03:45.064 - 00:03:46.306, Speaker A: We can do and we will be.
00:03:46.328 - 00:03:47.462, Speaker B: Doing and talking about.
00:03:47.516 - 00:03:53.126, Speaker A: So not only can you learn everything that's happening in this world, you also get to win some amazing amount of.
00:03:53.148 - 00:03:57.400, Speaker B: Prizes for building interesting and useful things.
00:03:58.270 - 00:03:59.658, Speaker A: Want to give a quick shout out.
00:03:59.664 - 00:04:00.886, Speaker B: To some of our amazing partners.
00:04:00.918 - 00:04:01.782, Speaker A: We have optimism.
00:04:01.846 - 00:04:02.950, Speaker B: Polygon scroll.
00:04:03.030 - 00:04:03.990, Speaker A: Nelson chain.

00:04:19.796 - 00:04:22.720, Speaker A: Here with us for this entire month.
00:04:23.090 - 00:04:26.014, Speaker B: Helping out, talking to all of you, telling you about how you can simplify.
00:04:26.062 - 00:04:41.670, Speaker A: Your life by using a lot of the SAS decays and not reinventing the wheel and also giving out a lot of prizes. But enough of that, let's talk about some of the stuff that you all need to know specifically about the hackathon logistics.
00:04:42.490 - 00:04:45.174, Speaker B: The most common question we've gotten is what can I build?
00:04:45.292 - 00:04:55.434, Speaker A: There's a lot of you who are joining us for the first time, there's a lot of you who are seasoned engineers in big companies that are trying to understand what's possible in crypto and some of the themes that we think.
00:04:55.472 - 00:04:56.842, Speaker B: Are going to be very helpful for you.
00:04:56.896 - 00:04:58.998, Speaker A: And also what others have said they're.
00:04:59.014 - 00:05:06.286, Speaker B: Going to do is on this slide, people are very excited to play with different D five primitives and Dows and.
00:05:06.308 - 00:05:11.678, Speaker A: NFTs on different L two S. So you get to take advantage. Of a lot of the scalability benefits.
00:05:11.764 - 00:05:15.346, Speaker B: And low gas costs for making those types of transactions and you can do.
00:05:15.368 - 00:05:22.690, Speaker A: A lot more interesting stuff or a lot more stuff that can be corrected on chain if something requires higher transaction.
00:05:23.270 - 00:05:30.390, Speaker B: Amounts not from a dollar standpoint, but just from the number of edits or commits needed to get to any outcome.
00:05:31.050 - 00:05:36.050, Speaker A: We have a lot of support for building on ZK roll ups.
00:05:36.130 - 00:05:41.386, Speaker B: There's a lot of things you can do in terms of understanding how we can add anyone from privacy to some.
00:05:41.408 - 00:06:14.114, Speaker A: More guarantees, to just hiding some information that should be not needed or must be publicly available for somebody to act on. And you have a lot of support for doing this, for anywhere from account abstraction to DeFi to NFTs to simply making just better tooling for the next wave of people to do all these things more efficiently and faster. Of course, the reason why we're doing this event for the second time is because we feel like the layer two ecosystem is still lacking really good developer tools and we want to really get thousands of more people to build on.
00:06:14.152 - 00:06:20.966, Speaker B: Top of these scaling solutions. And even if you can't find an app or you realize that something was.
00:06:20.988 - 00:06:58.578, Speaker A: Really hard, as you are doing your app, you get to take some time and make a tool that makes it easier for yourself and somebody else and let them make applications on top of these solutions better, faster, and more quickly. And of course, it's okay to not work on an app. There's so much to do here in this entire ecosystem that you can also take the time to build some guides or documentation or simply clarify how somebody can use it and help educate everybody else on how they can. Be in this ecosystem faster, quicker, or just really get into some of the.
00:06:58.584 - 00:07:03.250, Speaker B: Nuances that everybody needs to know to build on top of any of these solutions?
00:07:03.750 - 00:07:09.942, Speaker A: If you are one of the teams who's working on making easy to understand how to do something or how something.
00:07:09.996 - 00:07:12.374, Speaker B: Works, you also have the option to.
00:07:12.412 - 00:07:17.910, Speaker A: Submit those guides to Eveglobal guides. We'll be more than happy to publish one of these guides here.
00:07:17.980 - 00:07:19.174, Speaker B: And if you do end up writing.
00:07:19.222 - 00:07:23.654, Speaker A: Something that can help thousands of people, we'd love to make that an official.
00:07:23.702 - 00:07:25.930, Speaker B: Guide on eightglobal.com guides.
00:07:27.310 - 00:07:40.714, Speaker A: All right, now let's talk about the next three weeks and how all the logistics is set up for everything. I'm going to cover what we can do to find a team member, how you can get any help, all the prizes.
00:07:40.762 - 00:07:45.234, Speaker B: Of course, we're going to talk about all of our summits, and I'm going to talk about the most important thing.
00:07:45.272 - 00:08:15.126, Speaker A: Which is how judging and project submission is set up. So the most important thing is communication. So let's dive in. Everything is going to be on Discord. That means if you are a confirmed hacker, you would have seen a connect Discord button on your hacker dashboard on Ethglobal.com, and you should be able to see a scaling ethereum section up here on your Discord sidebar.
00:08:15.238 - 00:08:16.666, Speaker B: That means that only people who are.
00:08:16.688 - 00:08:20.746, Speaker A: Participating at the hackathon are going to be able to see those channels. So really make sure that you see.
00:08:20.768 - 00:08:31.470, Speaker B: That and you are actively connected to Discord, because that's where all the announcements, talks, prizes help, all that will be managed there, including talking to all of our mentors.
00:08:31.970 - 00:08:56.566, Speaker A: And these are private channels, which means that if you're not part of the hackathon, you will not be able to get access to them. And it helps us understand how do we make sure we effectively communicate things precisely to everybody who should hear about those announcements. And that's also where all of our partner channels are. Which means if you're working on any of the protocols out there, whether it's on an optimistic rollup or a ZT roll up, or some devtool or some DAP or any push notification service, you.
00:08:56.588 - 00:09:05.754, Speaker B: Can message anybody on that team through those channels. So please make sure you're connected to Slack and also make sure that your team members are there, because you also.
00:09:05.792 - 00:09:13.186, Speaker A: Get to talk to each other there. And that's where you can just make sure you can ping anybody, including the global team and partners and our mentors.
00:09:13.238 - 00:09:14.800, Speaker B: And all the other hackers too.
00:09:16.770 - 00:09:22.074, Speaker A: On top of that, we'll also be sending out calendar invites for all talks and workshops. You would have seen a calendar invite.
00:09:22.122 - 00:09:25.838, Speaker B: Today for this very session. There's a handful of other talks and.
00:09:25.844 - 00:10:00.074, Speaker A: Workshops happening, some of them already happened yesterday. We have a lot more next week. All that is going to be notified to you on your calendar. So it normalizes itself for the different time zones everybody's in. And as a note, all of this is meant to be very asynchronous, which means that we try our best to do things multiple times over the course of the hackathon and repeat this, so we can optimize for multiple time zone overlaps. But even if you have other obligations, whether it's school or work or something else, everything is going to be recorded. So even if you miss something, it'll be available on Youtube.com.
00:10:00.192 - 00:10:05.066, Speaker B: It's global immediately after it ends, and we make sure that everybody can catch.
00:10:05.098 - 00:10:06.414, Speaker A: Up and watch things at their own.
00:10:06.452 - 00:10:09.646, Speaker B: Pace or their own speed limit and.
00:10:09.668 - 00:10:28.562, Speaker A: Really understand what's going on and not miss out anything. And to see what's happening, everything is going to be on our website. You can just header over to Ethgoba.com scaling. There you'll see the full schedule. If anything changes, you'll see that reflected there. What's on the website is going to be the source of truth.
00:10:28.562 - 00:10:47.898, Speaker A: So we make sure that everything, whether it's your calendar invites, whether it's the top titles, whether it's a five minute delay, all that is reflected properly on our hackathon website. So the most other common question we've gotten is how does this hackathon work? For those of you joining us for.
00:10:47.904 - 00:10:50.454, Speaker B: The first time, it is fairly straightforward.
00:10:50.502 - 00:10:58.174, Speaker A: The hackathon eventually begins now and you can start working on your projects. You can work with them, with a team, and you can have a team.
00:10:58.212 - 00:11:02.506, Speaker B: Of up to five members. And you have the next two and a half weeks to hack.
00:11:02.618 - 00:11:15.138, Speaker A: That means that whole thing is about three weeks long as an event. That includes some of the extra time we have for judging and doing the closing ceremonies and going through all the prize winners. But you have the next little while.
00:11:15.304 - 00:11:21.286, Speaker B: To talk about all these things and work on the projects. So I'm going to spend a bit.
00:11:21.308 - 00:11:31.740, Speaker A: More time here on all the things that matter here for project submission and other things that you need to know. So the rules and criteria is the most important thing.
00:11:32.350 - 00:11:36.266, Speaker B: Everything that you're doing must start today and must be done from scratch, which.
00:11:36.288 - 00:11:43.070, Speaker A: Means that you cannot work on a preexisting project, you cannot add features to something you've done, and you also cannot.
00:11:43.410 - 00:11:46.734, Speaker B: Just deploy something you've done in the past to some layer two and call.
00:11:46.772 - 00:11:48.350, Speaker A: That a valid submission.
00:11:48.690 - 00:11:55.118, Speaker B: On top of that, only people who have successfully RSVP'd are eligible to win prizes. Which means that if you're working on.
00:11:55.124 - 00:11:56.478, Speaker A: A team of five and three of.
00:11:56.484 - 00:11:58.114, Speaker B: The people are listed as your team.
00:11:58.152 - 00:12:04.226, Speaker A: Members at the point of submission and the other two were accepted but didn't RSVP properly or didn't join your team.
00:12:04.328 - 00:12:06.194, Speaker B: If you win a prize in this.
00:12:06.232 - 00:12:08.546, Speaker A: Situation, only those three people receive the.
00:12:08.568 - 00:12:13.206, Speaker B: Prizes, not all five. So please, please make sure that all.
00:12:13.228 - 00:12:21.993, Speaker A: Of your team members are RSVP and listed and confirmed on your acre dashboard. And also there's going to be a.
00:12:21.993 - 00:12:26.186, Speaker B: Lot of edge cases and we totally understand that. So if you have a situation where.
00:12:26.208 - 00:12:39.760, Speaker A: You want to clarify something, you can just message us on Discord or email or Direct message or Twitter, wherever it is. We'll be able to understand what your unique situation is and help clarify and address any issues.
00:12:40.930 - 00:12:44.722, Speaker B: So don't hesitate to ping us and if you have any that comes up.
00:12:44.776 - 00:13:16.726, Speaker A: You can let us know and we will get to it immediately. Next, and the most important piece is judging. So here is something that we're changing for those of you who joined us in the past. Submissions are due on Sunday, March 26, at noon Eastern time. Everything we're going to do is default to Eastern Time, which is Eastern Time, New York, and you have until March 26 to work on your projects.
00:13:16.918 - 00:13:23.386, Speaker B: After that, we'll kind of talk about how judging works, but what it means on that Sunday is you will have.
00:13:23.408 - 00:13:27.614, Speaker A: To create a four minute demo video to submit what you've worked on over.
00:13:27.652 - 00:13:36.414, Speaker B: The past few weeks. This four minute is what's going to be a snapshot of what you have done and what everybody will look at. To review your submission.
00:13:36.462 - 00:13:41.742, Speaker A: For any prizes or any comments, this video is required.
00:13:41.806 - 00:13:43.426, Speaker B: This video is also very strict up.
00:13:43.448 - 00:13:45.620, Speaker A: On time, so you cannot go over.
00:13:46.470 - 00:13:48.514, Speaker B: The dashboard automatically prevent you from submitting.
00:13:48.562 - 00:13:55.240, Speaker A: Something that's longer than four minutes. And we also review all these videos individually to make sure that everything is.
00:13:56.010 - 00:13:59.302, Speaker B: As part of the rules. So if you speed it up, that.
00:13:59.356 - 00:14:00.982, Speaker A: Also gets you disqualified.
00:14:01.046 - 00:14:06.618, Speaker B: If you try to make it too long, you'll just be stuck on being able to submit your project.
00:14:06.784 - 00:14:12.266, Speaker A: And if it's too short, that also helps you not convey what you built on properly.
00:14:12.298 - 00:14:13.914, Speaker B: So please make sure that it's appropriately.
00:14:13.962 - 00:14:15.214, Speaker A: And as close to four minutes as.
00:14:15.252 - 00:14:19.550, Speaker B: Possible to really lighten or enlighten everybody.
00:14:19.620 - 00:14:22.480, Speaker A: On what you worked on for the past few weeks.
00:14:22.850 - 00:14:28.594, Speaker B: And please don't prepare this last minute. We see everybody realize that they need.
00:14:28.632 - 00:14:30.354, Speaker A: More time to make it better, to.
00:14:30.392 - 00:14:35.406, Speaker B: Make the demos work really well, to sometimes focus on conveying the right messaging.
00:14:35.518 - 00:14:47.778, Speaker A: All that takes time. We recommend that you block at least 2 hours to do this. Even though it's four minutes, it will take you a few revisions to get things right, but make sure that everything's under the time limit and all these details are going to be on your dashboard.
00:14:47.874 - 00:14:49.238, Speaker B: Right now, you're only going to be.
00:14:49.244 - 00:14:54.826, Speaker A: Able to see how to create a project, but next week onwards, you'll be able to see all the specific things.
00:14:54.848 - 00:15:00.586, Speaker B: That you need to do to submit your project and how the video works, and some previous good videos that we.
00:15:00.608 - 00:15:03.598, Speaker A: Recommend using as a reference for what a great submission looks like.
00:15:03.684 - 00:15:05.646, Speaker B: All those things are going to be.
00:15:05.828 - 00:15:09.600, Speaker A: Made visible to you on your hacker dashboard very soon.
00:15:10.690 - 00:15:13.502, Speaker B: Now, let's talk about what's changing for.
00:15:13.556 - 00:15:16.980, Speaker A: Judging and how everything is going to be set up after you submit a project.
00:15:17.510 - 00:15:20.302, Speaker B: We have two tracks of judging.
00:15:20.446 - 00:15:23.826, Speaker A: The first one is main judging, which helps you become a finalist for this.
00:15:23.848 - 00:15:27.926, Speaker B: Hackathon, and the other one is a partner prize judging, which is only if.
00:15:27.948 - 00:15:31.094, Speaker A: You are interested in submitting for a.
00:15:31.132 - 00:15:33.400, Speaker B: Prize, but not anything else.
00:15:35.050 - 00:15:36.806, Speaker A: For those of you who've been part.
00:15:36.828 - 00:15:40.566, Speaker B: Of our events before, the format is.
00:15:40.588 - 00:15:48.794, Speaker A: The same, but we're adding an additional step moving forward. So I'm going to talk about what the main judging looks like and how it's going to work. It's going to be set up in.
00:15:48.832 - 00:15:56.026, Speaker B: Two rounds and this is how the first round looks like when you submit your project on Sunday.
00:15:56.218 - 00:15:58.158, Speaker A: The next day is when we're going.
00:15:58.164 - 00:15:59.934, Speaker B: To do round one of judging, which.
00:15:59.972 - 00:16:04.674, Speaker A: Means that instead of joining a live call, which is how things were done.
00:16:04.712 - 00:16:07.566, Speaker B: Before, there will be an asynchronous round.
00:16:07.598 - 00:16:17.782, Speaker A: With our judges who review your video submissions. And we'll also be checking anywhere from your git history to the quality of what you submitted, to the live demo.
00:16:17.836 - 00:16:20.278, Speaker B: Links that you published, to everything around.
00:16:20.364 - 00:16:24.294, Speaker A: Your submission, and qualifying you for the.
00:16:24.332 - 00:16:29.974, Speaker B: Next round for the live demos that you are used to. This means that not every project will.
00:16:30.012 - 00:16:33.194, Speaker A: Move on, even if you want it to be part of the finalist track.
00:16:33.392 - 00:16:36.554, Speaker B: And within 24 hours of submission, our.
00:16:36.592 - 00:16:38.346, Speaker A: Goal is to notify the teams that.
00:16:38.368 - 00:16:47.280, Speaker B: Are moving on to the next round, to default to a live demo to our judges, where they get to have a conversation and talk about what they built.
00:16:47.970 - 00:16:52.174, Speaker A: So as our judges look at all the submissions on that Monday, we'll be.
00:16:52.212 - 00:17:01.358, Speaker B: Notifying the teams that made it to the next round. And that judging happens on Tuesday for round two. The way round two is set up is fairly straightforward.
00:17:01.454 - 00:17:23.530, Speaker A: All those teams will be sent a Zillow link. You will then be able to go on that call and simply demo what you built. You will still get four minutes and we default to playing the video that you submitted to our judges. It'll be a different set of judges as well. And in addition to the demo, you'll also then get a few minutes for A-Q-A after.
00:17:23.600 - 00:17:25.814, Speaker B: That is what we'll have to determine.
00:17:25.862 - 00:17:42.974, Speaker A: Who our finalists are and that's what sets up for the closing ceremonies, where we're going to demo some of our top teams to share what they built and what they were excited about as some of these teams. So this Zoom call will be synchronous and this will happen from 12:00 p.m. To 02:30 p.m. Eastern time.
00:17:43.172 - 00:17:50.226, Speaker B: And this will allow all of us to be on the call, synchronously and.
00:17:50.408 - 00:17:56.082, Speaker A: Chat about everything that you're excited about, everything you build, or any questions our judges have about your submission.
00:17:56.226 - 00:18:00.902, Speaker B: So that's the net difference. We'll notify this again to everybody over.
00:18:00.956 - 00:18:14.186, Speaker A: Email and all this information will also be available on your hacker dashboard as soon as submission opens in about ten days. And then for those of you who.
00:18:14.208 - 00:18:16.234, Speaker B: Are not interested in the finalist track.
00:18:16.272 - 00:18:26.106, Speaker A: And want to just go for partner prizes, that remains the same as before. Which is the partners will look at your four minute video and your source.
00:18:26.138 - 00:18:32.318, Speaker B: Code and your live demos and the project description to determine what is the.
00:18:32.484 - 00:18:34.478, Speaker A: Best team that represents the values that.
00:18:34.484 - 00:18:36.482, Speaker B: They'Re trying to accomplish for that price.
00:18:36.616 - 00:18:43.540, Speaker A: They will look at this at their own pace asynchronously and contact you on discord or email if they have any questions.
00:18:44.070 - 00:18:53.766, Speaker B: So this means that as long as you specify during your submission process that you are trying to go for X prize, the partners will be notified that you are one of the teams and.
00:18:53.788 - 00:18:56.326, Speaker A: This is your submission. And they'll be able to look at.
00:18:56.348 - 00:18:58.342, Speaker B: This and over the same window before.
00:18:58.396 - 00:19:09.946, Speaker A: The closing ceremony, they'll be able to tell all of us who the winners are for their projects. This also means that if you forget to notify in your submission process that.
00:19:09.968 - 00:19:16.382, Speaker B: You wanted to go for X or some specific prize, then we have no way of knowing that this is what you wanted.
00:19:16.436 - 00:19:21.070, Speaker A: So please make sure that you select the actual prize you are trying to qualify for.
00:19:21.220 - 00:19:32.354, Speaker B: Otherwise we won't be notified, the partners won't be notified. And if you say, how come I didn't get this prize? Or how come someone else was chosen over me, it means that nobody had.
00:19:32.392 - 00:19:34.194, Speaker A: The information that you wanted to be.
00:19:34.232 - 00:19:36.418, Speaker B: Part of that prize. So you'll get to do all of.
00:19:36.424 - 00:19:40.680, Speaker A: That through your dashboard and all that will be available to you very soon.
00:19:42.090 - 00:19:52.490, Speaker B: But in summary, you have to make sure that you take the time and make the video code. That is the best advice we can give you, which is that format represents three weeks of work.
00:19:52.640 - 00:19:56.442, Speaker A: And making sure you get the time to highlight why you're doing this thing.
00:19:56.496 - 00:20:00.894, Speaker B: Who you are, why it matters, and why you're excited about it is going.
00:20:00.932 - 00:20:02.186, Speaker A: To be very critical.
00:20:02.378 - 00:20:09.594, Speaker B: That video is what determines you receiving a prize. You going to round two of judging.
00:20:09.722 - 00:20:20.020, Speaker A: And also being a finalist for this global event. So make sure you take the time and don't ignore the work you need to do to make your submission look amazing.
00:20:21.750 - 00:20:24.850, Speaker B: And of course, I don't want this to be intimidating to all of you.
00:20:24.920 - 00:20:56.526, Speaker A: The biggest question is, well, what if I'm new to all of this? Well, not to worry. This event is designed for a lot of beginners. And our goal is to make sure that we do everything we can to make it really easy for everybody to understand what's going on and really take the time to learn and use the next few weeks instead of just a hackathon weekend to make this useful and knowledgeable and a good learning experience for them. So a lot of content for beginners and experts. No matter what your skill set is.
00:20:56.628 - 00:20:58.334, Speaker B: You have things to catch up on here.
00:20:58.372 - 00:21:06.158, Speaker A: And you can watch those talks, you can watch historical talks on our YouTube or learn about any protocol that's out there in this space and get a guided tutorial or even talk to the.
00:21:06.164 - 00:21:09.166, Speaker B: People who built it directly. So a lot of these talks and.
00:21:09.188 - 00:21:14.366, Speaker A: Workshops are available if you want to just understand what's happening thematically. That's where the summits come in.
00:21:14.388 - 00:21:15.846, Speaker B: We're going to start with our first.
00:21:15.868 - 00:21:17.540, Speaker A: Summit in 20 minutes and.
