00:00:00.410 - 00:00:08.080, Speaker A: And our first talk is going to be from Anna, who's going to give us an amazing introduction of this ecosystem. So I'll let our co host, Anna take it away.
00:00:09.090 - 00:00:18.110, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So I'll do a quick screen share. Here we go. Are you seeing my screen?
00:00:18.260 - 00:00:19.470, Speaker A: We are all set.
00:00:19.620 - 00:00:28.966, Speaker B: Perfect. Can you hear me okay? I'm guessing yes. Cool. So. Hi. I'm Anna. I want to quickly introduce myself.
00:00:28.966 - 00:01:33.654, Speaker B: I'm the host of a podcast called Zero Knowledge Podcast. I used to and will do again an in person event. I used to do this bi annually called the ZK Summit. So since we can't meet in person yet, I am very excited to participate in this event today because it's like the best folks working on zero knowledge are here today with us. So my goal with today's talk is it's quite a short talk, and I won't be introducing what zero knowledge proofs are because Elena, who's going to be speaking next, elena is going to be speaking next and we'll actually be giving a proper introduction to what a zero knowledge proof is. Instead, what I want to do with this is actually look at this evolution of ZK use cases and kind of give a sense for what the general landscape looks like and maybe why scaling and zero knowledge is so important. So zero knowledge and blockchains came together, and I would say, like, the first big use case for them was privacy.
00:01:33.654 - 00:02:16.434, Speaker B: And the second big use case, which we're going to be talking about today, is scaling. When you think about the sort of privacy context for ZK and blockchains, there's two main ideas that were first introduced and actually maybe one, which is private transactions. Zcash really popularized this idea of private transactions, using zero knowledge proofs to transfer funds from one account to another in a private setting. Another idea that was introduced soon after was this idea of private computation. So actually being able to do computation behind a zero knowledge proof. And that would allow kind of enable a lot of new and maybe more expanded use cases going forward. Now I'm going to give you a list of these are all kind of related still to privacy.
00:02:16.434 - 00:02:56.174, Speaker B: It's taking those first two ideas and pushing them even further. There's a number of new projects that are emerging, all at different stages. So Kartik mentioned the ZK Games Dark Forest. Brian's going to be speaking later about that. There's this idea of using ZK for self sovereign identity, maybe with password management instead of having passwords live on a third party server. There's something called selective disclosure, where you're actually sharing one small amount of information, maybe even for auditing purposes or regulatory reasons without revealing anything else. This is very new, but there's something like private AMMS that are being proposed.
00:02:56.174 - 00:03:29.882, Speaker B: So this is the idea of incorporating privacy into DeFi something that previously people thought would potentially break these models. There's like some new ideas around that that are coming out soon. There is private voting in the form of Macy. That's an ethereum based project. And there's also a very new use case that I am very excited about, which is this idea of private staking or private delegation. Henry Devalance from a project called Penumbra has just prepared kind of a first draft of what that looks like. But yeah, as I mentioned, all of these are at very different levels.
00:03:29.882 - 00:04:02.934, Speaker B: You have sort of on the privacy thread, you have theoretical research, proof of concept implementation and adoption. This is not perfect, obviously. These are kind of like moving around quite quickly. But you can see in terms of privacy, there's a lot of use cases at different stages. Now, when you talk about scaling, it's a bit of a different picture. I feel like with scaling, what you see is more project building and developing, but maybe less use cases so far. So here is a version of the L one, L two, L three paradigm.
00:04:02.934 - 00:04:27.382, Speaker B: Now I know this from having many conversations. These definitions seem to EB and flow. Like sometimes you'll say that an L two solution, as we're calling it like a Zcube roll up, is actually an L 1.5. I don't know. I'm going to go with this. Okay, I'm going to keep it for now. But anyway, L ones, there's some L ones that are actually using zero knowledge proofs in their core to scale.
00:04:27.382 - 00:05:06.720, Speaker B: So I think we're going to hear from Filecoin later. You're going to hear about examples of how they're using it. There's examples like Mina where it's actually using recursive Snarks all the way. It's all built around zero knowledge proofs. And now when we're going to be talking about L two S right here. As mentioned, one of the big differences between the privacy side and the scaling side is you just see this kind of explosion, this boom of new projects using zero knowledge proofs for this scaling activity. Yeah, and so like I said, there's not as many maybe, but the whole idea of scaling comes from a need.
00:05:06.720 - 00:06:03.774, Speaker B: And the fact that we needed to use zero knowledge proofs for scaling meant that it actually pushed the entire field of zero knowledge forward in a way that privacy alone didn't seem to. It's kind of actually unfortunate. It seems like privacy is a nice to have always, but in this case it was like a must have and that's really what pushed it forward. And so then my question to everyone is what's next? And I think at events like this, this is where you figure out what is next. What's next for privacy, what's next for scaling? And maybe what is that next stage of zero knowledge research and vision that pushes the space even further. So if you're interested in getting involved, I'll just share a little bit about the ways that you can basically get involved in the community if you want to join us, join our Telegram group or YouTube. You can find us on Twitter, and all of those links should be there.
00:06:03.774 - 00:06:34.770, Speaker B: There's also a newsletter that I'm sending out monthly called ZK Mesh, which is a rundown of all of the zero knowledge stuff. So check that out. Also, stay tuned for the next ZK sessions, which is a monthly event I do, and hopefully one day a proper in person ZK summit. And you can find all of these links here. I also just want to mention that I've been running these ZK jobs fairs, so if anyone's interested in finding a job, look out for the next one on May 19. Cool. Okay, so I'm at the end of my presentation.
00:06:34.770 - 00:06:37.894, Speaker B: I think I might have two minutes. I'm not sure.
00:06:38.092 - 00:06:39.094, Speaker A: Go for it.
00:06:39.212 - 00:06:42.960, Speaker B: Okay, well, I don't have anything more, actually. I just don't know how to fill it.
00:06:43.570 - 00:06:46.026, Speaker A: No, I think then we're back on schedule.
00:06:46.218 - 00:06:47.534, Speaker B: Cool. Okay, good.
00:06:47.652 - 00:06:58.620, Speaker A: We're good to go. Thank you so much for setting the context, and I think this kind of sets us up for the next.
