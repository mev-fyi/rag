00:00:33.020 - 00:01:53.640, Speaker A: Welcome everybody who just joined. Thanks for showing up. All right, it looks like we got the live stream on Twitter and hopefully the YouTube stream is working as well. Welcome, everybody who's just joined and is watching on live streams. We're very happy to have you. We're going to get started in maybe a few minutes. We'll give some time for people to join the stream or join the Zoom Room.
00:01:53.640 - 00:03:09.750, Speaker A: Not too long though, so stay tuned. Feel free to drop your local time in the chat. It is early morning for me. Not really. Yeah, Jacob and I, 10:00 A.m.. Okay, we got some evening, folks.
00:03:14.720 - 00:03:15.532, Speaker B: 10:00 P.m..
00:03:15.586 - 00:03:26.958, Speaker A: I think 10:00 P.m wins. All right. Pretty much. I'm just going to say we've got every time zone represented.
00:03:27.134 - 00:03:28.500, Speaker C: I got them all great.
00:03:31.990 - 00:03:33.810, Speaker A: With the global AMA.
00:03:34.870 - 00:03:58.700, Speaker B: I think that's so cool to think about this hackathon, how usually it's a bit burdened to travel across the globe and sometimes you don't have the chance to do that. And basically we have actually chance to participate in something like this across the globe. That's pretty nice, for sure.
00:04:03.810 - 00:04:07.440, Speaker C: Some people joining. So maybe wait a couple more minutes as they filter in.
00:04:07.890 - 00:04:20.400, Speaker B: Yeah, someone said it's a bit a burden, but a lot of fun. The old saying goes, if there is no pain, there is no gain. Enjoy.
00:04:53.630 - 00:05:12.350, Speaker A: If you're just joining, feel free to turn on your video. I know we're all online and we all know we're online, but it's good to see some faces because I'm just used to seeing if you're in hack money, I'm just used to seeing handles. It's nice to see faces.
00:05:15.510 - 00:05:18.340, Speaker B: Well, a lot of geek looking.
00:05:22.470 - 00:05:25.170, Speaker A: Aren't we all a little geeky, Donnie?
00:05:25.910 - 00:05:27.800, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
00:05:28.250 - 00:05:31.430, Speaker C: Yes, we are on your video. Instantly insulted.
00:05:32.570 - 00:05:34.360, Speaker A: Everybody turns off video.
00:05:36.570 - 00:05:37.990, Speaker B: It's a compliment.
00:05:42.670 - 00:05:49.050, Speaker C: Cool. How are we doing? Looks like we have about 20 people in here, which is great. There we go. As I said, it happened.
00:05:49.120 - 00:05:52.090, Speaker A: 20 people, the final joiner.
00:05:53.070 - 00:05:53.482, Speaker C: Cool.
00:05:53.536 - 00:05:57.018, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we can kick it off if you like. Jacob.
00:05:57.194 - 00:06:29.880, Speaker C: Sounds great. Yeah. So everybody, thanks so much for coming to Stannie's AMA, just to give you a little bit of a sense of what's going to go down, we'll do a quick little intro with Stannie, get a sense of his background. We won't go as deep as childhood, but we'll hit some level of it after that. There's a couple of questions we got from people who couldn't make it due to time zones or otherwise didn't want to make it. So we'll go through some of those and then we'll open the floor up. So get thinking about what questions you have for Stani because you'll be able to ask them directly over the Zoom call.
00:06:29.880 - 00:07:01.810, Speaker C: So just keep that in the back of your mind. And without further, I'd like to first say thank you to Stanni for taking the time to do this AMA with us and of course for Ave's support on this event. Ave is actually a 2020 partner for ETH Global. So we're really happy to have them on board and they've been really essential in our year so far. So happy to be working with them again and happy to be working especially at Hack Money where we're really excited to see what people can build on top of Aave and on DeFi. So cool. Welcome Stani.
00:07:03.430 - 00:07:11.350, Speaker B: Thanks Jacob. Yeah, definitely nice to be here. I've been in participating and mentoring.
00:07:13.850 - 00:07:14.166, Speaker D: In.
00:07:14.188 - 00:08:53.366, Speaker B: The previous hackathons and I think it's very unique opportunity, kind of like I will go a bit of my background in a moment, but just to say a couple of words about the It Global. I think it's a rare occasion where you are basically in a universe that you can build anything and there's no restrictions because when you look in the current system that we have, for example finance or whether it's related to privacy, you have different kinds of kind of like you're maneuvering in a field where everything's not compatible. So you're kind of like restricted on these different layers. And I think once now when we are in this kind of like composable ecosystem, you can actually just do anything and these hackathons in it global and especially like the DeFi one, which is something that's related very much. That I'm doing myself. It's pretty cool because there is nothing like stopping you on developing something that helps a lot of people without actually having a lot of issues with the compatibilities. And compared for example, if we will build some sort of like a financial application on top of banking system and you have different kinds of layers and of course banks don't want to talk to each other on a retail level because they want to safeguard their customers.
00:08:53.366 - 00:10:19.966, Speaker B: So that's pretty cool. And my background is interesting in a sense that I used to do development myself, programming, I think I was 13 or twelve years old. I started to build things on basically PHP, so the very classical programming language, and got very interested actually into Ruby and followed that community. And I actually ended up going to study law because I really loved rules and kind of like programming made a lot of sense. There's a lot of mathematics involved and it's very easy to get kind of like outputs from inputs. And law was for me, kind of very difficult to understand because there is so much interpretation like what's right, what's wrong? It's very subjective. And when I was studying in college in the Nordics in Helsinki, one of the things was for me interesting that I went into one of the events about basically was kind of like a technology event where startups and investors meet and it's one of the biggest ones called Slosh.
00:10:19.966 - 00:11:04.606, Speaker B: And there was like a year where blockchain was on very high level. They're introduced. So I think it was 2015 or 16. I think it was 15. And there was a lot of discussion about basically Ethereum and now what you could do with smart Contracts. And when I understood you have this immutable technology, so first time you can actually build things and that particular piece of code will not change. I was thinking that that's something that is very intriguing and how you could use that in a way in different kinds of legal applications.
00:11:04.606 - 00:12:48.098, Speaker B: So I tried to find different kinds of things there but I've been always interested in finance. That's something always I always kind of like the idea of money in a way that not necessarily in a materialistic way, but more of how it's used as kind of like a note in different ways. And you have money somewhere, like earning interest you have money somewhere where you're paying interest and that it has interesting kind of like, dynamics. I think the dynamics is the right word that basically I was interested in and I saw actually that there is a lot of cool things that are applicable to finance and what you could actually solve with smart contracts and Immutable code. And that was 2000 and I think 16 where we started to think what if we try to do a financial transaction that is a bit more complex than for example PHP rocks. So that is more complex than just the basic transferring funds from one address to another one and having some condition. For example, there something that actually represents a financial transaction from the financial markets for example and not to make it too easy we tried to think like how do we make this transaction trustless? So the two counterparts when they do this transaction they don't need to trust each other and we picked up a loan transaction and that was the time when basically the ERC 20 token started to gain more value.
00:12:48.098 - 00:13:51.186, Speaker B: So actually there was secondary market so you could actually start to use them as a collateral. So this whole over collateralization thing came up from there and basically we did our very first lending protocol that was actually launched on Ethereum called Eatlend. And basically that's where we started as a proof of concept to see what this technology could allow us to do. And I think after that it's basically things started to move. Stablecoins were coming up, pooled models, lending pools, liquidity pools started to come into Ethereum and things started to get layerized. So basically now that all these financial applications are in Ethereum they started to talk to each other and that was where the actual hacking started to happen. The stuff that you build on the protocol level, it's kind of a bit boring in the sense that you are providing a platform to others to hack.
00:13:51.186 - 00:14:49.206, Speaker B: And it's even boring today than it used to be because now you have to build that layer and you have to overly focus on security and making sure that, of course, in all the layers, but especially in this. Layer like the liquidity layer, focusing on security. And actually when things are happening on this in between all these kind of different hacks, that is where the money hacking comes and yield hacking comes and what's things that are going to come from this hackathon. So that was like our story. We launched the Lending protocol on January a few months ago, reached roughly 50 million market size. And the growth has been very interesting because I think most of the liquidity comes from actually different kinds of integrations. For example from curve iron and so forth.
00:14:49.206 - 00:15:39.590, Speaker B: So you see actually that focusing on the composability. It actually is a very good network effect. So the more you share, the more you let people to use your liquidity and the more you use other providers liquidity, the more the ecosystem grows. And I think this is very difficult to understand if you come from traditional finance or not even like finance, but kind of like a business logic that kind of like you are competing against everyone and that's completely reverse here. You're actually complementing whatever you're building, complements the whole ecosystem and that's a super fascinating part in the ethereum ecosystem. So that's.
00:15:41.290 - 00:16:03.742, Speaker C: Great. I mean you touched on so many things that I want to dig into and they're related to a lot of these questions that we got ahead of time too. So maybe just to mentioned Ave, the company itself made a transition from the original product which was ETHLend, which I think at the time was probably one of the earliest, if not the earliest lending DAP, right. Is that true?
00:16:03.796 - 00:16:04.400, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:05.090 - 00:16:26.118, Speaker C: Cool. The first one. Yeah. Awesome. So you guys were sort of like almost pioneers in the space, which is really cool. What did you learn from kind of the Ethland proof of concept that ended up becoming core functionality in Aave? And maybe if you could touch a little bit on what makes Aave different than some of the other things in the market.
00:16:26.284 - 00:17:48.306, Speaker B: Oh, that's interesting stuff. Well what we learned, I think the biggest thing we learned during It land is basically that kind of like you need to treat the liquidity as a network effect. To get liquidity you need to have some kind of innovation and then it comes, it's kind of like you have this electricity grid that you're plugging in your innovation, whatever it is, basically is it lending? Is it basically payments related or insurance or whatnot? That innovation will actually get that network effect and drives it. And I think that was the very first thing we understood. That also kind of like when you treat liquidity, you need to always understand how it moves so you can't fragmentize it too much. So back in Italy for example, we had over 150 different collaterals you could use and there's a different liquidation discounts there. We kind of choose the model of this kind of like an OTC very wide marketplace because the liquidity in general was very low in the DeFi space.
00:17:48.306 - 00:18:40.282, Speaker B: But today it's kind of different because if you look at from D five pools for example, the locked value into space it's somewhere 600, 700, 800 depending on the timing million which is still small compared to traditional financial markets and instruments. But what is interesting is that it's a proof that the liquidity is there. It's sitting there and it's basically just looking place to be parked and it's now parking those protocols and also the protocols and things that are hacked on top of them for various reasons. One is the security, one is basically the yields. Those are the kind of like drivers that you need to attract. But also there's other things that doesn't relate at all like financial mechanisms. For example, like brand.
00:18:40.282 - 00:20:05.658, Speaker B: I mean DeFi is also kind of like a brand game and a game where the subjectivity of the team is valued as well. And I think in our community we'll see that because people who build on top of Ave, they also kind of like they can relate to us. We're very down to earth and trying to help developers being with them, solving different kinds of problems in terms of like implementations integrations at 02:00 A.m. In the morning and those things are just because that's how we have built always and that's how people can relate to us. So that's one thing that we learned and a bit of what makes difference and of course in terms of what we are trying to achieve with the protocol is that we are trying to package risks and different kind of collateral models into different pools. So we all know that we have like for example one lending pool with preselected assets there that you can actually borrow against or deposit and earn. And we understand that at some point in the DeFi space there will be basically hundreds and hundreds of collaterals that are very liquid.
00:20:05.658 - 00:21:21.206, Speaker B: And if the tokenization of different kinds of assets continues, we could expect kind of like a future where every asset has some kind of interest rate on chain and then you could use that asset as a collateral. What you can actually do is that you can package these different kinds of collaterals into different kinds of pools. And one of the things that we are, for example, launching next week is a pool where you can use uniswap liquidity as a collateral. And the idea is there that you can actually provide different kind of risk pool and also try to with that different kind of risk, attach a different kind of reward, which is basically yield and get more liquidity into this system. Because the thing is that we are not competing or sharing the liquidity that is already in DeFi, but our job is also to bring new liquidity into the space. And that's basically what those DeFi yields usually have been doing when they have been high up. When they're down, then people don't talk that much about DeFi and it kind of goes back.
00:21:21.206 - 00:21:21.800, Speaker B: And.
00:21:26.490 - 00:21:48.160, Speaker C: One of the other things I think that strikes me about Aave that's pretty unique is obviously your use of flash loans and that sort of thing. Maybe I'll grab the arpit. I don't know if you want to unmute and ask your question about Flash, that's something that you can do or Trent can do. There you go. Sure. No, you're good. Go ahead.
00:21:48.160 - 00:21:48.974, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:49.012 - 00:21:50.286, Speaker D: So one fine day I wake up.
00:21:50.308 - 00:21:54.718, Speaker C: And then I'm checking Twitter and then there's this brilliant idea about flash on site.
00:21:54.884 - 00:21:57.418, Speaker D: So it took me like a day.
00:21:57.444 - 00:22:07.300, Speaker C: Or two to dig into it but it was super interesting. So I was wondering what kind of conversations or discussions led to it. How did you guys come up with it?
00:22:08.170 - 00:23:36.100, Speaker B: Yeah, actually that was a pretty interesting stuff because what we noticed when we were looking at different kinds of protocols in DeFi and also modeling our own liquidity, we kind of noticed that there is a lot of assets there that are actually like when you deposit into and usually those reserves are fractional. And fractional basically means that some of the liquidity is not used and not allocated and that basically means that it's a bit of less efficiently allocated. And we were trying to figure out different ways that how you could reuse that liquidity in any shape or form. And one of the things that for example, we do is that we take the liquidity when you deposit, you get an interest bearing token and you can use that elsewhere and probably at some point in the future you can deposit that interest bearing token to another protocol and so forth and so forth. You get these layers. And another thing is basically we thought that why don't we just basically let people to flash borrow on one transaction from the pool. Since there are use cases where you could actually use it and flash on itself.
00:23:36.100 - 00:24:53.130, Speaker B: It's not like a concept that we invented by itself. We have our own implementation but there have been previous implementations and some of them haven't been basically used previously. And our goal was just basically before we implemented, we were thinking like what kind of use cases you could have. And one of the things that we wanted to do is that we wanted to see how flash loans will affect the composability, so how flash loans will be used in the whole DeFi ecosystem and started to think different kinds of use cases. And I think from all those use cases we came up with Arbitrage and basically I think a couple of other ones can't even remember what we did. But after we launched, I think in total, there was over a dozen different kinds of use cases and some of them just came when I was brainstorming with a developer who was thinking like kind of like asking help in a brainstorming in different use cases and suggesting ideas and just came up with pretty fascinating stuff. And one of the interesting example is the collateral swap.
00:24:53.130 - 00:26:32.874, Speaker B: I opened a CDP and I noticed that actually if I want to change my collateral which is practically your long position, I need to close my CDP and I was thinking why can't you do that? Kind of like on the run and then of course you can do it but you need to return your capital. So the die you meant you need to return and then I was brainstorming with Mariano Conte and asked why don't we use flash loans? So instead of me returning, like if I have a long position on Bat and I want to switch my collateral to ETH, why don't I basically just flash borrow and close the CDP and open the ETH loan and still I have my die somewhere or I have already spended it. I don't need to return it back for a and then I posted a Tweet about this that can someone build this thing? And David, one of our team members, well one of our developers who is actually here very active in hackmoney he basically took a look at the idea and started to build and he basically built this kind of like application which is called collaterals. I mean it has even site like collateralswap.com and you could just swap your collateral. Well, David is basically now working at Aave and doing pretty interesting stuff. But that's just an example like how you are using Ave and then you're using at the same time maker as well to do different kinds of things there and there's other things you could do.
00:26:32.874 - 00:27:31.690, Speaker B: You could actually refinance your loan instead of swapping your collateral on maker you could actually refinance your loan die loan to USDC to compound switch the collateral from bat to eat at the same time and you can have automated system that swaps your currency all the time to get your best rate. So I think the composability factor was the key thing and the reusing of the collateral, the most important things that actually led to the Flashlon implementation. And because we were very unsure what kind of security risk there could be, I mean, after all the diligence that we had, we basically added a reentrancy guard there so that you can't use our Flash loans against our own protocol yet. So we kind of wanted to take a very slow step into this direction.
00:27:35.190 - 00:28:17.474, Speaker C: Thank you. Awesome. Thanks for the question Arput. I mean, also a question in the chat that's sort of related to something that I saw online as well, which is I know there was a conversation in the Ave Channel, like maybe five or six days ago about yield hacking. And I think, even though it's been years in the industry, for me, there are so many terms in this industry that are just novel all the time. And I was wondering if you could kind of expand on what yield hacking is and how that has to do with I think it has to do with redirecting interest and that sort of thing. So I'd love to know a little bit more about what you define as yield hacking and obviously you're excited about it, so why it's so exciting for you?
00:28:17.672 - 00:29:31.898, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think what's cool about yield hacking is you're trying to basically a bit of break the current yield system in DeFi. So you're trying to innovate in a way that you actually bring more yield to the depositors. So as I basically went through, we see a bit like the liquidity as a network effect and liquidity comes when there's yields. So let's say it's kind of like a water which basically goes to the direction where there's more water and so forth. So the idea with yield hacking is that you're trying to build something that gives even more yield to the current system and at the same time you're utilizing the current system or not, but in the sake of composability you are doing something very on top of the current system. And one of the examples in yield hacking is that you're depositing into one place, for example in one protocol to earn interest and then you take the interest bearing node and you go to another place and use it as a collateral there to do something else.
00:29:31.898 - 00:30:19.110, Speaker B: And from there you do something else and something else. And one of the things for example I've seen is that let's say you have the normal lending protocols, for example Ave and someone builds on top something else. For example curve, curve phi. So basically the stablecoin swaps, so people provide their liquidity. So what curve does is that they take that liquidity and deposit into Ave to get the interest rates. And also when people are trading stablecoins back and forth, it generates more trading fees. So the liquidity providers are actually grabbing not just the trading yields but also the Ave interest yields.
00:30:19.110 - 00:31:20.240, Speaker B: And you can just build block by block all the time and you're just hacking and hacking and hacking more yields. So actually what happens end of the day or end of the cycle is that those lending protocols that we have at the moment, for example, Ave, compound and so forth, they will not even give you the best rate. There will be so many layers on top that actually provide you even more and better yield. But end of the day you're depositing on here and it goes all the way down into the lending protocols or liquidity pools like Uniswap or balancer. So that's like the terminology and that's just how you get the liquidity, that's how you basically feed your innovation. And the interesting part is the actual innovation, like what are you going to do to get more yield and how do you hack? And you can do a bunch of crazy stuff. You can just look traditional finance and look what you could build there.
00:31:20.240 - 00:31:24.800, Speaker B: One of the examples is that you could actually build an options.
00:31:26.610 - 00:31:27.038, Speaker C: Kind of.
00:31:27.044 - 00:31:52.134, Speaker B: Like a derivative, where when the rider creates an option, you put there a collateral. That collateral, whether it's Dai or whatever. It doesn't need to sit in that smart contract. But it goes to Ave, for example, and then you're extracting yield there. And then also the writer gets paid the premium. That the person who buys the option. And that's just example of yield hacking there.
00:31:52.134 - 00:32:49.274, Speaker B: And I think coming up with this idea and brainstorming with someone, that's the coolest part. And most of the yield hacks that I've seen so far it just happens from some kind of brainstorming discussion. Yeah, so that's like the terminology. One important thing about yield hacking is that before you go to mainnet or anything like that, you should really be cautious on how secure your code is and all the diligence because some of the yield hacks I've seen is pretty awesome. But then again, if you are not expecting them to take off, you never know how much liquidity there will be tomorrow. So they can go from zero to 100 very fast. And it's kind of like an issue in DeFi as well that if you build something very awesome you can't stop it.
00:32:49.274 - 00:32:58.060, Speaker B: If you don't have any kind of kill switches there I mean limitations in your smart contract, right?
00:32:58.670 - 00:33:43.718, Speaker C: Makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I saw mention in the chat when you have increased yield it becomes of a higher risk. Maybe we'll jump into another thing that I saw from ahead of time, which was obviously one of the things about DeFi is that it's still early days, right? And we've seen a lot of kind of interesting exploits or kind of like ways of people having different attack vectors on DeFi and otherwise draining contracts and that sort of thing. So especially recently we've had a couple kind of high profile hacks. What are your thoughts on, I guess maybe the security of DeFi? Do you think it's like people aren't taking it seriously enough or is it on the users or in general? What are your thoughts on the latest hacks?
00:33:43.734 - 00:33:59.614, Speaker B: In the mean, like the whole beginning of the year it was pretty intense in terms of like I think there was the BCX event, it almost became like a sport of hacking and then kind of like the interesting part is.
00:33:59.652 - 00:34:00.240, Speaker C: That.
00:34:02.070 - 00:34:58.158, Speaker B: It'S a kind reminder of how mission critical software we're building. So I think what's good to understand in this hackathon is that when you go to mainnet you're not just pushing a piece of code out, you're actually putting something there which anyone can interact and anyone can participate. The very cool part also becomes a bit of a responsibility. Even in DeFi we tend to think about it's there. Anyone can verify the code and see how it works. But the mainstream users or everyone aren't developers and if they are, they probably will not see everything that might be there in that code. That might lead to very uncomfortable situations.
00:34:58.158 - 00:36:20.314, Speaker B: And it's just very important to understand that when you are going to put something that you want to actually scale and kind of like you want to continue building it, it's just very important to try to get as. Much as diligence there or some sort of limitations because, as I said, you might be building something small, which is very interesting. But tomorrow, if you put it on the main net and becomes very popular, it can have millions of dollars locked there in and then it's kind of like very difficult situation if something happens. So that's something important to understand. And also I haven't seen any this is kind of weird but I haven't seen any projects coming to mainnet and just putting this kind of limitations like how much capital the smart contract can bear or how much you can deposit on one address or even small limitations there or forced insurance purchase or something like that. I haven't seen anything like that but I'm pretty sure if someone does something like that it gets like a lot of exposure and that's a good idea to keep in mind. Oh, jelly swap has put limitation.
00:36:20.314 - 00:36:22.046, Speaker B: That's nice, that's cool.
00:36:22.228 - 00:36:24.222, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they might be the only ones.
00:36:24.356 - 00:36:31.220, Speaker B: Yeah and they integrated all that today so I might go and see how those limitations work.
00:36:32.150 - 00:36:46.950, Speaker A: The only one I can think of is the maker supply cap but that moves very slowly, it's not like a newer project that's trying to decrease risk it's at the opposite end of the spectrum. One of the older ones.
00:36:47.100 - 00:37:40.040, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And the thing what Maker has and Aave is kind of like we put a lot of diligence into the auditing and security in general and the building process and that's also very difficult part because the threshold entering into DeFi is kind of like growing. So we all know that smart contract audits are expensive and kind of like those are something that you need to go to mainnet. So it's kind of like difficult thing to cope but I think health limitations and risk disclaimers, those might be very beneficial. And I think if someone comes up with more that kind of stuff, that's a lot of respect. That's a lot of respect from the whole community, I would say.
00:37:41.770 - 00:37:59.440, Speaker C: Yeah. When I think about at least centralized or traditional finance it's not unusual for those types of companies to put limits on your accounts in some way. Right? I think anyone who's tried to buy crypto with their bank might have seen that your bank is not so happy with that risk profile half the time. Right?
00:38:02.290 - 00:38:32.406, Speaker B: Some of them limitations are super silly of course, super. Annoying even. That's the thing in DeFi. It's pretty awesome. Liquidity moves very nicely. Then when you have to go back I think crypto people, they kind of suffer of this. When they have to go back to interact with their bank or the old banking system or old platforms, they see how painful things are.
00:38:32.406 - 00:39:38.670, Speaker B: And when you see how things actually could be done, like how DeFi works, it's far more efficient. For example, I flew from our office to visit my family to Finland and for some reason my card was locked and I couldn't pay my taxi ride. So those kind of things happen and you see it's basically limitations done wrong sometimes it's kind of like very annoying. But I definitely agree there's like a long, long track record. And also fraud is a big thing. There's fraud in crypto world and phishing but it's also like it's very big in the traditional finance and it's just like something that happens to every financial institution and they kind of have these kind of different things and sometimes the limitation doesn't work well. But I think at least we have the chance to build very good ones that doesn't limit your actual good usage.
00:39:40.130 - 00:40:06.760, Speaker C: Awesome. Do you think that DeFi will inspire the traditional finance world to otherwise be more competitive in that regard? Will it be a situation where because there's such a high pressure from the liquidity and the ease of use of DeFi that centralized finance and traditional will have to adapt? Or do you think that DeFi is just going to totally eclipse centralized finance and take over?
00:40:07.370 - 00:41:50.482, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it really depends how quickly they are on board because let's say if DFI can grow in the current way to let's say to ten to 15 billion without too much of an interference, then DFI might be like in a size that you can basically minimize it by putting regulation. That's kind of the opposite of the idea of the movement of DeFi. And especially if there's more and more institutionals as there are already that are coming into DeFi and finding comfort levels there, I think then it has pretty good chance. But it really depends on the people, how much they will see because the only thing I see in the old phi, I mean the old traditional finance, is that it just becomes more difficult than difficult. Even if you see better user interfaces, let's say you have money transmitter meters or in Europe electronic money, kind of like service providers and there's less legacy banking system there. But end of the day the whole system is built a bit wrongly and it suffers from not efficient systems so they can't compete with that kind of technology with what we are doing in DeFi. So I don't know what's going to happen, but the flipping happens when those all five people will come to DeFi and start doing the all five stuff in DeFi.
00:41:50.482 - 00:42:56.460, Speaker B: So let's say if it's efficient to trade options futures on basically centralized products such as oil and you can do it with way larger amount of counterparties without fearing that you have to move your collateral or fill tons of papers to join a trading venue under a trading venue. I think then we see a bit of flippening that people will come from that board to here and I think at some point it might happen even. And I think in this hackathon I already saw a few projects that people are building that actually might have the potential to get that kind of audience here. I don't blame them because the way they could actually trade or interact is way better and with very transparent market more efficient. So I think that will happen at some point but I don't know when.
00:42:59.010 - 00:43:12.640, Speaker C: Got it. Sai, I think you had a question in the chat, do you want to ask it live? There you go. Looks good. Hello?
00:43:13.510 - 00:43:52.880, Speaker D: Yeah. Hi, Stanny. How do smart contracts really play a good role in terms of Black Thursday events that happened with MakerDAO and there is no liquidity among every protocols like KyberSwap, Paraswap and One inch, okay, so no one was unable to purchase at very low prices and keep holding that particular cryptocurrency with them. So how do you think smart contracts will play a major role to mitigate these kind of issues when it comes to traders who really allow to purchase at low and want to sell at high?
00:43:54.930 - 00:45:34.762, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually interesting question because the Black Thursday was a kind of like a market stress test for the of like I see now the way that why people are taking like where they're liquidating positions is basically that they get the discount and then they liquidate those collaterals in for example Kyber uniswap. And the thing is that even though there's liquidity, there isn't enough liquidity. So DeFi is heavily reliant upon centralized exchanges. So if I will be a liquidator and I will not be able to liquidate just by using Kyber or using uniswap, I would have to liquidate in a centralized exchange. And the very funny thing is that in Black Thursday the gas prices because everyone was moving ETH and doing transactions on ethereum. So even centralized exchanges had issues because when you send their funds, I mean it's still in the ethereum ecosystem and when you're trying to withdraw them and get back into the liquidation game. So if you basically liquidated some eid and you send the to a centralized exchange to get back some Dai or USDC and get back to liquidate, your kind of like circulation process basically stopped because let's say Binance also throws transactions in certain gas level and then you basically needed this gas level cost to do transactions.
00:45:34.762 - 00:46:39.858, Speaker B: So it was basically an example where you see that those liquidators are relying on centralized exchanges as well, even though you could get good discounts. But the system wasn't just efficient because everyone was relying on automation and no one was expecting that. For example, the gas price jumped very high and capital is stuck in different places. So in the Black Thursday, what was funny kind of like well I couldn't say funny, but interesting is that the liquidators I was talking, they were basically saying that I want to liquidate, I want to get those discounts but my money is stuck in exchanges and I just can't get out of them. And untapped I don't have any more funds to liquidate and I can't go along because they need to sell them that you can actually get those discounts. So that's the centralization thing. It's already very part of it.
00:46:39.858 - 00:47:49.980, Speaker B: But I think the real way to get rid of that is just to grow the dex economy. And basically, at some point, if it's big enough, we will reach a point where there will be more decentralized liquidity than centralized. And I think that will happen soon because there will be probably a lot of layer two solutions as well in terms of trading. I know a lot of trading protocols that are actually now looking into layer two because you can get the transactions to another layer but then you have the collateral in the main net and you can basically do efficient trading and still handle the collaterals in the main net so you're not like burning the whole network. So I think just like the only way to solve this is just to grow the DeFi economy and it's growing pretty nicely. Even like a year ago, the Kyber for example, uniswap they were pretty small in terms of liquidity that there are today or year and a half.
00:47:50.750 - 00:48:27.880, Speaker D: Exactly. Completely agree. But major factor that will stop all the transactions is the gas fee. Right? So due to the gas fee only the decentralized exchanges were not able to take the new orders or liquidate the orders. So can you please comment on gas fee terms? Like how can be able to build a protocol where traders who are willing to purchase at very low price and then just keep that particular asset for a long time.
00:48:28.810 - 00:48:31.526, Speaker B: You mean if you have to hold the asset for a long time?
00:48:31.628 - 00:48:59.946, Speaker D: Yes. So only thing that is restricting me to purchase that cryptocurrency is the gas. Right. So if the gas fee was very low then the transactions will go through and every system will work very fine. But I don't think both centralization and decentralization are failing when it comes to very volatile markets. Yeah, grow upon on this.
00:49:00.068 - 00:49:52.098, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree that gas is something that is basically reducing the purchase. The only thing I would say that basically when some of this liquidation happens you just need to ensure that there is basically enough of the discount. So if you pay gas to move things, whatever you're getting in that liquidation event you basically get more. And I agree that there's an issue in terms of like if the gas cost is too much and the loans that you're liquidating basically doesn't cover the gas cost, it's not worth to liquidate. And I see those kind of loans like hanging sometimes. The good thing is they're kind of like small loans. So as a bigger comparison to the whole protocols that these kind of small underwater loans are, it's not that big issue.
00:49:52.098 - 00:50:07.960, Speaker B: But I think this is a question of how we get more people into it. But I would say the one solution is to get the trading activity into layer two so that we have less things going on in layer one and I think that will happen.
00:50:09.370 - 00:51:15.740, Speaker C: Cool, thank you. We also got a question on the YouTube Livestream for Thomas. So I'll read it out from him since he's not here. So I guess sort of also related to things that we need to do for the flipping to happen and overall for DFI to gain more and more liquidity. I guess two part question one is do you think that right now what we have around ERC, 20 is do you think that's enough for us to kind of get to where we need to be from? I guess. Both the usability perspective and just the actual protocol itself. And then kind of the follow up is like, do you think that there needs to be a universal standard of what a DeFi protocol looks like that's sort of already audited and sort of like a template that everybody else forks to build on? Or do you think that what we currently have, where everybody has kind of their own bespoke solutions, is enough? And I guess how do you feel like for both of those things? Do we need to change them, do we need them to adapt for us to really hit sort of the flipping point?
00:51:16.590 - 00:52:26.894, Speaker B: Yeah, the first one is quite something because the thing with ERC 20 is that you basically have something that everyone agrees upon so that it fits everyone's kind of like a needs or fits their system. So it's compatible. That's very important. Otherwise if you can't agree on, let's say traffic lights and how they should work, the result will be very not good. But also the thing is that I definitely think that in some level you have to have standardization. There basically that liquidity can seamlessly move. But I also think that you really need to have the innovation is so important that you kind of sometimes need to go beyond that and try to innovate different kinds of things and perspective and to get actually new things created.
00:52:26.894 - 00:54:13.720, Speaker B: And I think in that way we definitely need more standards and also kind of understand what could be the very benefits and also have more kind of this standard pitching because it seems that we do have quite an interesting amount of standards but then there is not that much pitching around it because I think users, they will use whatever you have to use that you can actually interact with different protocols. But for the ecosystem, people need to kind of understand if you adopt some innovation, what it will mean in long standard and not argue about, okay, how this will differ from the old standard or is it compatible with the old one. Or we should think also like the innovative side, like how we could change the system that we have. And I think that's where the standardization is important and agreeing upon things. On the second question, agreeing upon things, I think that's something that's missing. There isn't just any centralized body that could actually agree upon or anyone hasn't come together and thinking like okay, before you go main net, you have to have this and this audit for this amount of time. But I think there will be, I've seen for example, the consensus, the Codify project, they have the DeFi score and they already have some kind of suggestions how the auditing process should go, like how many auditors, how many weeks.
00:54:13.720 - 00:55:15.240, Speaker B: And based on that, they give you actually a DeFi score to your protocol. So I think there's already tendencies and the more we come together and decide things like as a big group of people and there is this kind of like a soft law, the less kind of worry there will be from regulators if the system works. But if the system stops working and fails continuously, then the system will get regulation and the regulation will mean that you're subject to the same thing that basically we have in the current financial system. And it's basically the ball is on our hands now, like do we want that or do we want actually innovate? And it requires just everyone's effort to choose. And I think we want to choose, but it really needs effort to do.
00:55:17.050 - 00:55:18.700, Speaker A: Going to take a lot of time.
00:55:19.230 - 00:55:19.882, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:55:20.016 - 00:55:25.146, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I think there will be like mistakes along the way that will force people to learn, right?
00:55:25.328 - 00:55:43.250, Speaker B: Yeah, and mistakes are okay because we should try things. We should try and it's part of the innovation as well. I mean, some things will not fly and some will and we learn more and those mistakes are very valuable lessons.
00:55:45.350 - 00:56:30.000, Speaker C: Maybe since I don't think there's any more questions in the chat, maybe we'll do one more and then we'll end on another note. But I guess related to this, what are your thoughts around governance in the space? Right? Like you mentioned that Codify exists. They're sort of like a centralized unit for judging DeFi scores. Obviously MakerDAO is sort of by definition a Dow compound. Just released their protocol around this. What are your thoughts around this sort of thing? And do you think that's the way forward to proving to regulators that we are self regulating, that we are thinking about the right issues and that sort of thing?
00:56:30.470 - 00:57:23.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I think especially when you're building like open source software and when you're in an ecosystem where basically everyone kind of has control and there isn't like trust, there's need somehow to change things or decide upon things. And it's not just like changing code, but just basically any kind of like a sentiment. And I think the governance is the way to do it. I think the token based governance is something very workable. Some people think about it that it's kind of like not democratic because there's a lot of whales. And I definitely agree upon that. It's not democratic.
00:57:23.294 - 00:59:06.274, Speaker B: But it doesn't mean that it's not working in terms of governance because I compare more DeFi protocol governance to, let's say stock board, let's say like governance of companies where basically governed by shares and the board and so forth. The more people have stake in the system, the more they actually want to govern the system as well. And that's why we basically have this kind of big stakeholders. But I think if the system is based that there is always these big stakes there, it's kind of like a difficult in terms of dynamics where you actually want to distribute the governance and even non token based system have governance. If you think about for example Bitcoin and also ethereum miners, the system is built on decentralization, right? But by design, by practice, you basically have a lot of centralization there. And the way that capitalism works, that the more you put funds into the system, whether it's the capitalistic system of where we're living, like actual living or these decentralized systems, you basically get more power out of it kind of like as a compounding interest all the time. So by nature it's extraction of value from small group of people to people who have large stakes in the system and it's kind of like a problem.
00:59:06.274 - 01:00:21.820, Speaker B: But the good thing about in DeFi is that because the systems are transparent, you could actually limit this kind of a flow from small when you have very decentralized system and small stakeholders, large group, small stakeholders going to that way you can actually make conditions that this kind of a group who might be, for example, active users, that because of their activeness, they also get that particular power and they get the power to govern. And then you can basically stop this massive movements of capital to big stakeholders. And I think not many protocols have yet understand that, but I think not many have done it. I think everyone probably understands it because we obviously know that there is whales around everywhere, like in the ecosystem. But I think the first protocol that does it very well, we will see actual very democratic governance even though you're governing something that resembles financial governance, like company governance, and that will change a lot of things in a good way.
01:00:24.030 - 01:00:26.346, Speaker C: Cool. Awesome. Great.
01:00:26.448 - 01:00:45.890, Speaker B: And just to show a bit, basically Aave is coming also with a token based governance and there's going to be some interesting mechanics as well. So those who are interested in governance and following what's happening now in DeFi, really recommend to stay tuned.
01:00:46.470 - 01:00:59.400, Speaker C: Awesome. Excited for that. Cool. Yeah. So I think that's basically all the questions. Just have one more to wrap up on. But just before that in general, some stuff about for hack money.
01:00:59.400 - 01:01:57.660, Speaker C: Just that everybody watching right now has an idea of what's to come. Most importantly right now is next week we're going to be doing a demo day. So if you're working on something very cool and you want to kind of show off your halfway progress so far, awesome opportunity to do that. And then, of course, next week we'll be doing more check ins with all the team members to make sure that how your progress is going and connecting you to relevant people like if you're working on Aave, for instance, with Stani or anybody else from their team. So that's the kind of what to, you know, with know stani, thanks so much for your participation here and your thoughts. I really enjoyed this conversation and I'd love for if you could end on maybe what is maybe your favorite project in the space that's not Aave or maybe a small project that you don't think gets enough credit. What are your thoughts on maybe some of the up and comings that are working on really interesting problems right now?
01:01:59.070 - 01:02:04.554, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is the moment I need to shill someone.
01:02:04.752 - 01:02:06.620, Speaker C: Yeah, this is the shell time.
01:02:07.790 - 01:02:59.166, Speaker B: Yeah, well, there's a couple of one I would say Pydao is pretty interesting. So basically you can trade indexes that's something like I showed them not that much about just for shilling, but basically because they have very sympathetic theme. And I think that's even more important because I know that someone will always build the stuff that needs to be built. Someone will build Ave and the next ave and so forth. But it's the people who are important, the human composability that I really respect. So definitely that's something. And those guys are pretty amazing in terms of what they're doing.
01:02:59.166 - 01:03:36.710, Speaker B: And also when you talk with them so they get all the credit. Then I would say other interesting stuff would be, well, I really like pull together token sets. I like them a lot. I like compound a lot from other older protocols. Not much. I think everyone is doing very important stuff. But yeah, awesome.
01:03:36.710 - 01:03:40.934, Speaker B: Yeah, that's my shows for today.
01:03:41.132 - 01:03:50.990, Speaker C: Sounds good. All right, cool. Thank you so much, Johnny. And thanks everybody who came and attended this. Looking forward to seeing what you guys build and we'll catch you guys all on Discord.
01:03:51.490 - 01:03:52.874, Speaker B: Thanks. Thanks everyone. Cheers.
01:03:52.922 - 01:03:54.798, Speaker A: Thank you, Sonny. That was awesome.
01:03:54.964 - 01:03:56.000, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:03:56.930 - 01:03:58.010, Speaker A: See everybody in discord.
