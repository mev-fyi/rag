00:00:06.490 - 00:00:46.220, Speaker A: As we bring on everybody here on the panel, I'd like to welcome three amazing people. So Luca from Maker, Nikhil from Circle and Fran from Superfluid. We're going to talk about just how we think on chain payment is going to evolve. Maker, Circle and Superfluid are kind of the common pieces here that everybody's using for just interacting on the chain, especially as we think about stablecoins being the fundamental base layer of sending money here and what DeFi has done. So I couldn't be more excited to bring everybody on. So at this point, I'd like to ask everybody to turn on their cameras and kind of introduce themselves and say hi and we can get this started. So welcome everybody.
00:00:46.220 - 00:01:00.430, Speaker A: We already know who Fran is, but I'd love to invite Luca and Nikhil to introduce themselves and talk about what you do and just give an overview of the product for those of us on the chat that may not be aware.
00:01:01.730 - 00:01:31.580, Speaker B: Thanks having me guys. Luca here. So I work with Maker. I'm one of the core team members of Maker, pretty much looking at anything that has to do with the financial risk oversight of the protocol. I'm an independent researcher. I write my own research and publish it under a substac called Dirt Roads that I hope that some of you have heard of and invest in the space and have great chats with super smart people. Ekfra so thanks for having me.
00:01:32.670 - 00:01:34.060, Speaker A: Excited to have you.
00:01:34.510 - 00:01:54.850, Speaker C: Nikhil yeah, thanks for having me. Karthik. My name is Nikhil Chanduk. I am Chief Product Officer at Circle. What Circle does is it makes a stablecoin. It sort of ships a stablecoin, which I think everybody knows about. It's USDC.
00:01:54.850 - 00:02:13.158, Speaker C: We have products in the payment space that we have in market and that we are building further out. We're excited about payments, we're excited about lending. So we can talk about anything today. So thanks for having me.
00:02:13.324 - 00:02:39.040, Speaker A: We're excited to have you as well. So maybe I'll kind of just jump right in. The most kind of obvious question is you've kind of seen this ecosystem evolve from multiple angles here. What's kind of been the most interesting trend about specifically payments that each of you have seen? We can start with Fran here and have you kind of just showcase what has surprised you in the last year.
00:02:40.530 - 00:03:18.570, Speaker D: Well, I mean, working at Superfluid, obviously I think the most interesting part of payments is streaming, right. More in general, recurring payments. The reason specifically I'm excited about recurring payments is that it can actually bring income on chain. And that's very interesting if you look at, for example, Erbil's presentation from earlier, right? Because bringing income on chain is what will onboard so many users, right. One of the examples he brought was Gamify, right? So like play to earn games. And these are onboarding literally millions of users. And they're not coming to speculate, they're coming to earn money.
00:03:18.570 - 00:04:03.594, Speaker D: Right. So the earning potential that recurring payments or streaming brings and the fact that those earnings are on chain and can be used for other stuff I think is very interesting. I think we're still just scratching the surface here. I think Puma Finance is going to be a very important protocol in the future regarding lending against these earnings. In terms of other payments infrastructure, I've seen a lot built on Superfluid that I'm very excited about. We've seen Diagonal Finance, but also another startup called Drip, which are building checkouts with, let's say, specific mechanics built into the payment layer itself, right? And that's something that you can uniquely do on chain. Well, you can't really do off chain, right? So if the payment happens, then trigger something.
00:04:03.594 - 00:04:25.060, Speaker D: You can deliver a loyalty, NFT, you can deliver a social token, you can redirect a recurring, for example, referral revenue, right? All of these things you can encode directly into the payment stream because it's happening on chain. So this is kind of the most important and interesting thing for me.
00:04:26.070 - 00:04:28.820, Speaker A: Amazing. Luca, anything to add?
00:04:30.550 - 00:05:33.240, Speaker B: Mean I started chatting about what the guys at Superfluid were doing almost a year ago because I think, again, streaming payments can be abstracted into streaming value that can have so many applications. And I always thought that the way DeFi or crypto in general steps up to the next level is by onboarding as many use cases as possible from the real world. So I think allowing value to flow seamlessly through people to people in payments, but also in supply chains I think is what fascinates me the most. I had a couple of chats with companies that are trying to innovate in the supply chain system by creating a seamless flow of value that goes along the chain, which is an incredible source of inefficiency these days financially with a lot of value trapped. So I'm very excited to see the evolutions in that front as well.
00:05:34.010 - 00:06:26.520, Speaker A: That's awesome. I think you've already kind of all touched upon topics that I want to dig into in general. And by the way, we're already kind of getting some comments from the audience. If you have any questions for our speakers, please just put them in the chat and I'll be able to ask them here. But to me, this is an interesting point because I think both Maker and Circle are kind of at the intersection of onboarding, existing businesses that are in Web two to more web3, but also then enabling a whole new set of web, three native companies and types of businesses to exist. Kind of from how you've seen USDC or dive being used, has there been something that's kind of surprised you in terms of, like, oh, I didn't think this could be possible? Or of course, streaming is a perfect example, but I'm curious what has been an unintended consequence of a good example of how your stablecoins have been utilized by people?
00:06:30.170 - 00:06:32.440, Speaker C: Maybe I can take.
00:06:36.430 - 00:06:37.530, Speaker B: I'll say two things.
00:06:37.600 - 00:07:09.842, Speaker C: One is we have the Circle has this partnership with Stripe where they're doing payouts on Twitter. And so the use case is Twitter have creators that they want to pay. These creators are all over the world. They want to make sure that they can essentially share earnings with them. What's an easy infrastructure to build to be able to do that. Well, clearly using on chain payouts is the best way to do it. Doing it in a stable coin is definitely preferable.
00:07:09.842 - 00:07:52.158, Speaker C: So Stripe and Twitter are experimenting with USDC for these payouts. Why this is interesting. I worked at YouTube for seven, eight years. I was there really early and YouTube is one of the earliest companies that did creator payouts. For those who don't know, if you upload a video on YouTube, you get to keep and you monetize it, you get to keep 55% building that infrastructure that connects the ad impression. The ad payout to the creator payout is extremely complex and then scaling it to the whole world is where YouTube is at. I think today at like two and a half billion users is incredibly complex.
00:07:52.158 - 00:08:35.940, Speaker C: So I think to do that so simply is fascinating to me because that was one of the ways we built a motor on YouTube because nobody else could do it, facebook didn't do it, and I think they're just doing it now. And so I think the power of that is pretty phenomenal. I kind of love the idea of streaming payments there. I haven't wrapped my head around ad verification to streaming a Payout to a creator. I think there's some nice use cases to explore there as well. So that's sort of one bucket, I'd say. The other bucket that is really interesting to me again is I think there are two large ecosystems about to collide which is really interesting.
00:08:35.940 - 00:09:22.602, Speaker C: One is payments, which is how can we make it more efficient, we can make things more efficient and we can unlock more use cases because we do things on chain. So that's super interesting. Whether it's streaming, whether it's payouts, there's all manners of things we can do. The other is the ads ecosystem. And we don't talk about ads much in crypto because I think nobody likes ads, but ads basically built the internet. And yes, along the way there were some trade offs that were made that are not pleasant and not good. But I think the fundamental business need is to acquire users and have a way to acquire users, and businesses will pay money to acquire users.
00:09:22.602 - 00:10:13.578, Speaker C: What I see happening now with novel payment formats, with NFTs, with these new novel platforms coming together, is sort of a collapse of the payments ecosystem, with the ads ecosystem. And I think that is super interesting. Which is like if there is a wallet that pays me and if I can have a close relationship with the user because they paid me on chain and then I issue something. To them on chain and then I have a loyalty program and if that becomes super portable and allows for new networks to emerge ads market is a trillion dollar market. Payments itself is trillions of dollars market. So the need for cheaper payments and the need for acquiring customers is not going to go away. And if you collapse those two things together, we are in this new world of payments and ads working together, which I just find intellectually very fascinating.
00:10:13.578 - 00:10:16.240, Speaker C: And I think we're just seeing sprouts of that now.
00:10:17.430 - 00:10:27.110, Speaker A: That is a really good framing. I do want to kind of comment and dig into that, but I don't want to deprive Luca of any comments that he wanted to share. So I'll go for it.
00:10:27.260 - 00:11:16.318, Speaker B: Yeah, sometimes I get a bit abstract, so I apologize in advance. It's the mathematician in me. I think all of us are seeing a different angle of the stablecoin and the payment system in DeFi, which is fascinating. I think the USDC guys at Circle, they have an incredible perspective on ramping of liquidity. And the true use of USDC as a means of payment, which is fascinating at Dai is slightly different. I think at Maker we are starting to see the use of Dai as a great stabilizer of DeFi. You will never imagine because Dai ultimate is like is a central liquidity source of DeFi, very trustable.
00:11:16.318 - 00:11:54.254, Speaker B: And now after the last two weeks, we are starting to see the value of this trust. I always thought the problem that over collateralization is not a scalable system in stable coins is a meme. It's not true, but I will go into that rabbit hole. But I think we are starting to see Dai being used as a stabilizer of many use cases in DeFi from interest rates to interest rates and liquidity risk here and there. And I think this is something that it was not imaginable a couple of years ago. Right. I think crypto instability were two things that were not going together.
00:11:54.254 - 00:11:58.466, Speaker B: But I think it's something that we will see more and more and more over the years.
00:11:58.648 - 00:12:26.460, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I remember just two years ago we're celebrating D five TVL hitting a billion dollars and then now we're over 100 and nobody even thinks about that exponential leap. And the pace that everything is evolving is just truly mind blowing. Fran, I want to also kind of give you a chance. Of course, streaming is a super interesting, massive category of its own. What's kind of been something that you've kind of seen uniquely enabled on the streaming money side?
00:12:28.190 - 00:12:56.766, Speaker D: Well, actually, without mentioning streaming money, I think what Stripe did was super interesting as Nikhil mentioned. I mean, that was just incredible. Right. It really shows you how crypto can break barriers significantly, right. Where a traditional fintech would have to go and have specific partners in each country. They want to make a payout in and that effectively means only Google can do it with crypto. You can send money anywhere and that's something we're seeing a lot also in Superfluid.
00:12:56.766 - 00:13:57.430, Speaker D: If you look at some of the teams that are using Superfluid to pay compensation, they pay people all over the world. In a lot of cases they don't even know where their team is and they can just pay that because an address is just a unique identifier. That is all you need to make a payment, right? Contrast that with a bank where you get asked the reason for the payment, you get asked the address of the payment, I recently got asked the birthday of the payee, right? So it's just a completely different world. And if you think of the fact that you can establish long term financial relationships just by clicking a button and making one transaction on the blockchain, I think it's clear that there's a lot of opportunities there. And as Nikhil said, it's a massive market. So bringing payments on chain and onboarding that next billion users will be through payments, I have no doubts because not everybody needs to trade dog money, right? But everybody needs to make payments.
00:13:58.570 - 00:14:46.726, Speaker A: That's absolutely right. And this is exactly what I was going to comment on for Nikhil's question, which is fundamentally the reason why some of these massive kind of companies sort of got the network set up is because you have to take on anywhere from the legal cost to understanding the generalization of this payout network. And it's different for every jurisdiction, different for every country, different for even different amounts, triggering various attach cases. And you now just get to eliminate that by having an address that just exists and you can figure out multiple ways to now use that or disperse that in different places. And I think that's to me an interesting good example of a middleman where you've just made that the abstraction and it can flow anywhere from there. And now you have explorations possible on both sides. So I can either figure out which Fiat railway to connect to, to disperse it in different places and that's what stripe is kind of going on on the other side.
00:14:46.726 - 00:15:41.974, Speaker A: Now I have the money, I can stream it in different places, but it's on the top layer, that's where Superfluid is going. And you fundamentally have programmatically sort of enabled a whole new world that just wasn't possible before. When we kind of think about that essentially of course I agree money is a massive market, everybody needs that for everything in any capitalistic world. But is kind of the thinking here that we fundamentally just get the same experiences that we already know and use in our daily lives, they're just now more transparent or faster or do you kind of believe that it changes how we also interact? I mean, Nikhili touched on the ad part of things and customer acquisitions becomes a lot more easier. But how do we think about room for improvement on now Bunny being on chain? It's an open question. I can have anybody of you? Luca?
00:15:42.022 - 00:16:28.578, Speaker B: Yeah, I can say that if it's fine for the other panelists. I always joke that I think money is the most sophisticated mass market product in the world. It's like the most complex philosophical product. We all use it, we completely ignore how it works and we are all happy, which is incredible. But I think the point is money does many things right. We always have the canonical definition that money is a currency in general, is a unit of account, is a storage of value, is a means of exchange. But I think there is another point that I think is the most important, is an allocator of resources.
00:16:28.578 - 00:17:08.226, Speaker B: We work more where we get more money. And it's four very complex functionalities that are wrapped into one. It is the banknote we have in our pockets or the money we think we have in our accounts that is actually very different from the banknotes, but people ignore it. But I think we go used to the idea that the money of the future should be the same, should be like this omnicomprehensive product. I don't think it's going to be the case. I think we will see different types of currency or subsets of currency doing different things. And then you might have a great stable coin.
00:17:08.226 - 00:17:31.920, Speaker B: I hate the term, but let's keep stable coin. The great stable coin for transact, a great stable coin to access leverage. A great stable coin to store value. Great stable coin to allocate incentives. And this is what the token economy is enabling. And I think we will start seeing this type of specialization you dig in the future.
00:17:32.850 - 00:17:40.330, Speaker A: What are some of the properties of these three examples? What will be different for a coin there and why does that classification exist?
00:17:40.490 - 00:17:59.590, Speaker B: I mean, I'll give an example, an infamous example of what happened in the last few months. So, Terra was minting USD. People were not using USD as a mean of exchange. They were not using USD as a storage value. They were using USD as an access for leverage. That was the only thing. It was not a stable coin.
00:17:59.590 - 00:18:43.934, Speaker B: It was a money market product within a coin. And I don't want to go into the details, but it was a source of leverage. People are using Dai to store value on chain because they think they believe in this principle of decentralization and over collateralization. And the crypto natives, they love using Dai as that storage of value. But Dai itself uses USDC because USDC is a great stabilizer, because represents mimics the power and the trust of the US economy into crypto. And we are the largest holder of USDC in the world, at least until a couple of weeks ago. And the relationship is synergic.
00:18:43.934 - 00:19:43.590, Speaker B: USDC is also used for transacting off ramping and on ramping and maybe other tokens that can flow through the superfluid protocol, for example, that are not coins, will be incredible tools to incentivize people better than currency. So I think we started to see things being differentiate themselves and it's difficult for us because we have always considered money as one single monolithic construct, but it is not even in the real world. And I'll stop mumbling, but even in the real world people are using the dollar in a different way compared to how they use their local currency in emerging markets. That is a payment tool. The dollar is an international payment tool or a storage of value and I think it will become more and more and more specialized. Now, what would be the ultimate experience of the end user? I don't know. Probably would be seamless but in the background many interesting things will happen.
00:19:43.660 - 00:19:54.682, Speaker A: I think that's a really interesting abstraction to dig into, I think. Fran, you wanted to say something, so I'll let you and Nikil kind of comment on the original question. We can dig into this after wanted.
00:19:54.736 - 00:20:20.942, Speaker D: To comment on what Lucas saying. That's something I've been thinking about a lot and I think with things like superfluid where you can actually really accelerate the movement of money and automate it, we will start seeing people having basically no dollars in their bank account. Right? But that's not because they're not transacting in dollars. They are transacting in dollars. They're simply transacting really quickly. But they're not holding any dollars. They're holding.
00:20:20.942 - 00:21:06.306, Speaker D: Maybe bitcoin or ethereum. Right? So they're using dollars as a medium of exchange but not necessarily as a store of value or stability or anything else. Right. So these kinds of things become possible as you build financial automations and financial tools that enable money to move faster and exchange forms faster. Right. If it becomes easier to for example, imagine if as a user you can put your Bitcoin or Ethereum as collateral and then borrow in a stream to pay your rent, right? At that point maybe the person you're paying a rent to is then reinvesting it into Bitcoin, right? So I'm paying the rent in dollars. I'm taking the leverage in dollars, but I actually never hold dollars and the counterparty never holds dollars either.
00:21:06.306 - 00:21:19.894, Speaker D: So we're using dollars purely as a unit of account for the rental contract and as a medium of exchange. But neither of us actually have dollars. Right. So it's a pretty fascinating idea if you start thinking about it.
00:21:19.932 - 00:21:27.960, Speaker A: Really is. I was going to say we're kind of coming up with the photons of the money world analogy in this case.
00:21:29.710 - 00:22:01.358, Speaker C: Yeah, I love that idea by the way. Money is many things. Lucas point cash is highly inefficient, sits in my pocket and doesn't do anything. And so money, dollars in my bank account, sits in the account and doesn't do anything. Well, it does do something. It allows the bank to lend forward. But I think one of the things that Fran is pointing out that it can do more things for me, like if I have $200 in the bank, I can have it be in Bitcoin.
00:22:01.358 - 00:22:32.518, Speaker C: I can real time essentially stream my rent. I find that idea really fascinating because I came to work on this primarily because I think the risk capital in the world is misallocated and how can we get it to be allocated better? Because that's what people who are poor need is they need risk capital. They don't need a gift of money. They need a stable form of capital. And they need to be able to take risk, which is in America. It's phenomenal. Like the way you can do that.
00:22:32.518 - 00:22:52.340, Speaker C: And crypto does that on chain. Now, you can take on risk. You can take on risk. There's not as much risk capital. It's all over collateralized. But I think the dream is where it's under collateralized and you can have the money. If I have $1,000 sitting in my USDC account, it's actually true for me today.
00:22:52.340 - 00:23:17.478, Speaker C: I have money. Any cash I have, I put into Maple Finance. Now, it's not quite streaming. There is a lock in. But it's just money that I park there because it's being used to fund these businesses on the other side. And there's a very specific type of business there today. But the reason I fund it is because I believe more real world businesses are going to come in through these pools that Maple are exposing.
00:23:17.478 - 00:23:55.122, Speaker C: And it's highly efficient for me to be able to deploy that money. It takes me like two minutes, like, go into my MetaMask, do a couple of clicks and the money is deployed. I think that kind of efficiency is really powerful in terms of creating opportunity for people. That's what gets me jazzed, which is all the other DeFi constructs are fascinating. But if we can connect the real world to this, then we should be able to none of us should have dead cash. That doesn't mean that we don't get access to liquidity today. We hold cash because we need access to liquidity.
00:23:55.122 - 00:24:12.190, Speaker C: I think we could deploy our cash and still have access to liquidity would be like the magical place to be. And then we can have fun, more things in the world because we would just be fundamentally more efficient. But yeah. Fran, I'd love I actually was just reading your paper before starting. I find it fascinating.
00:24:13.170 - 00:24:48.034, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think I can jump in here because I think it's relevant to what Nikita just said to describe how we can compose this monetary stack. So, dai, we have an infinite balance sheet. We can print as much dai as we want as long as there is trust in the dai. So we need good collateral to print dai against. And we started with this idea of onboarding real world use cases a year ago in a bootstrap way saying okay, let's go to the borrowers directly. But it will be like the Fed trying to underwrite a mortgage of an individual, of a corporate.
00:24:48.034 - 00:25:47.178, Speaker B: So it's very inefficient, it's a task. So we are starting to do protocol to protocol liquidity. And the example of Maple is a relevant example because Maple has been currently approved by the Maker community to develop a direct deposit module where there will be a Dai pool potentially where maker will be the stabilizer of that pool. Maker will print money and deposit it as a senior trench of that pool that then loans the money out together with other money through pool delegates that take first loss risk into the real economy. And in this way we are letting Dai flow in the hands of as many people as possible, but in a very sustainable way and composable way, where we have a competitive advantage infinite balance sheet at quasi zero cost of capital. Other pools have other competitive advantages. They are great in creating products, they have great access to the ultimate borrowers, they have a great user experience or structure, whatever.
00:25:47.178 - 00:26:27.522, Speaker B: So we give them our advantage access to a super cheap and infinite source of capital as long as they do their job well and they do the rest of the heavy lifting and take most of the profits. In this way we can help other borrowers to other lenders to take the right type of risk they want and not being exposed to a bank run and borrowers to access risk capital. Because I agree, this is the real what we want. We want to give good risk capital to the right borrowers and Maple is doing it to Africancy traders. Tomorrow we'll do it to somebody else. Goldfinch is doing in the emerging markets, credits wants to do it in emerging markets. TrueFi is doing it to corporates.
00:26:27.522 - 00:26:30.680, Speaker B: So there is a lot of innovation there.
00:26:31.610 - 00:27:00.980, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think no, that's a really good way to think about kind of just framing that. And I was going to say for both of you, Luca, and like I think USDC especially is in more of a position where you get to see more traditional businesses coming in and on ramping. Kind of from your perspective, what's holding up more volumes to kind of go up or anyone from mercena adoption to just a high kind of volume case. What are some common themes or roadblocks that you see or questions that get asked?
00:27:01.750 - 00:27:09.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we can look at it both from a lending perspective and a borrowing perspective. I think from a lending perspective.
00:27:11.530 - 00:27:11.942, Speaker B: People.
00:27:11.996 - 00:28:07.880, Speaker C: Are still skeptical of crypto yields. They don't fully understand it. Was it last week that US terror died? That is not good for us as an industry. People just equate USDC, Dai, USDT with Terra and they have the same questions. And even our largest lenders called us that day and they said, well, how does this affect you? Even though we are very clear that we are Bitcoin, when you put money into circle yield, it's over collateralized with Bitcoin and there's no connection to us terror, but still makes people nervous. And I think it's just early days in terms of people getting comfortable with yield that crypto markets can create. Also, our yields are not the best right now because the Fed is giving out amazing.
00:28:07.880 - 00:28:52.120, Speaker C: So I think that is not lost on people. So they're like, well, I can take on the risk of crypto, but for what? So I think that'll eventually settle. One argument can be, well, those yields are going to converge eventually because who cares whether it's crypto or not. Well, I still think there's some time before that happens. On the under collateralized lending side, on the borrowing side, so to speak, I'd say we're just like Maple is just a year old. Even Goldfinch, I think, is less than a year old. Like being in market, I'm sure those projects are longer, but them being live, it's so early.
00:28:52.120 - 00:29:48.490, Speaker C: Look at the experience of lending into a pool on Maple today. You can go and evaluate the pool, you can see their history, you can see who they're lending out to, but really don't know because you really haven't digested the data. There's no rating service on the debt that they have. There's nobody who is tracking the performance of the underwriter over a long enough period of time and arguably there hasn't been a long enough period of time. And so at least my vision is that eventually we move into a world in which there are hundreds and thousands of underwriters on the internet and they are in these very specific pools that are specific to industry. And if you're in climate, you want to represent carbon credits on chain and you want to make sure there's a unique representation of a carbon credit so it's not sold twice. It's like a common problem that I have found in my discussions.
00:29:48.490 - 00:30:35.880, Speaker C: I talked to somebody who was doing a protocol and they were just buying invoices and they had a specific protocol where they would buy the invoices and make 10% on like a net 90 invoice and they have specific needs and that's going to get encoded in a protocol. And then eventually they will have specific underwriters within that protocol who are essentially managing that debt. So I think this whole ecosystem will evolve really fast. We need is, I think, systems that can, allocate across these different pools, systems that can evaluate the different pools, more primitives to represent these assets on chain, because those primitives are very basic right now.
00:30:39.610 - 00:30:44.074, Speaker A: What's the list of new primitives or variations that we need to see? I know you already cut.
00:30:44.112 - 00:31:11.394, Speaker C: I think they're industry specific. This is what I said. How do you represent a carbon credit? There are these voluntary carbon markets and now verification is easier for. Some class of use cases because you have satellite imagery. Okay, great. So I know that the trees that you said are going to be there are there, but now there's no way of knowing. Did you carbon credit three times? Well, if everything goes on chain, you can be sure that it wasn't sold three times.
00:31:11.394 - 00:32:01.362, Speaker C: Right. I think it is going to be by industry. So I don't think maybe there's one protocol that rules them all and it's possible, but I think there will be some sort of like if you look at the web and then there was search and I don't know. What the equivalent of search is. But I think we will go looking for yield across these vast pools as an economy and we're going to have to figure out what are the systems we need to sort of allocate capital across these different yield pools and people will have a zillion preferences and then all of this. How does this intersect the real world in terms of security laws? Do you only want this to be a DeFi system? Not really. If you want to attract all the money, then you have to intersect the world of securities laws at some point.
00:32:01.362 - 00:32:45.220, Speaker C: How will that work? So those questions come from businesses as well. Going back to your original question like, well, if I buy this, am I buying a security? And what happens if I connect my wallet to it? What if the wallet is hosted? There's all kinds of regulatory things that we're still reasoning through, but I'm very optimistic that if we can show the benefit, then the demand will come, the supply will come. You can call either side the demand or the supply because the need is there. If you are starting a business today, if you want to do something new in the world, you need capital and that need is not going away anytime soon. And nobody will say that it is a very efficient market.
00:32:47.910 - 00:32:48.834, Speaker A: For access, right?
00:32:48.872 - 00:33:18.182, Speaker C: Yeah, the Internet will do for allocating this risk capital the Internet did for information, it made it super cheap. So how will that happen? I don't know. It's only been like nine months or a year of this ecosystem. I'm very excited about it though. So I think it goes past payments. I think payments is really one I'll give it back. Payments is really interesting because it creates that on chain data that can be used for verification.
00:33:18.182 - 00:33:50.950, Speaker C: Like is the supplier somebody who pays on time? How much have they paid? Who have they paid? Can you analyze the network of payees? What can you learn about it? Can you then grade the supplier higher or lower based on that? It's like navigating a network and making building an index and learning about it. But yeah, done very differently because you're allocating money has value. Getting information wrong also has cost. But the cost is not immediate, it is diffused.
00:33:52.410 - 00:33:58.086, Speaker A: You've essentially made the case for Luca's argument for specialization needed to yeah, 100%.
00:33:58.188 - 00:34:26.100, Speaker C: I just don't know if I believe that there is a stable coin per ecosystem or if there's just different ecosystems that all have different rules and they're all normalized using dollar denominated stablecoin. Or if you look at Fran's argument, which is like in each of these ecosystems, you hold maybe the native coin, and then you use the dollar just to settle, and you're in and out of the dollar really fast. That may be just fine. I don't know which way to go.
00:34:29.030 - 00:34:31.460, Speaker A: Luca, Fran, anything you want to add to.
00:34:35.650 - 00:35:08.378, Speaker B: Mean I agree. I think it's great to remain open minded, and I think I have no clue as well how this will develop. And I think a good researcher reacts to new information with new hypothesis. So it is something that we keep evolving. But what is exciting of this industry for people like ourselves is we are not like journalists that are trying to predict the future. We are working to make that future real. So we also have an influence on how these things would develop.
00:35:08.378 - 00:36:14.190, Speaker B: And I think I myself, I came into this industry after 15 years in traditional finance, and I see incredible amounts of talent coming into this industry, and they don't really care about prices. So I think even the bear market is going to be extremely productive. And I think more talent will come in, the more ideas and will be developed. So it's something that we can shape together and we don't need necessarily to mimic exactly what was before DeFi. I also think, for example, that this is a dream because I think it will mean that we will have had a successful transition on on chain economy. I think at some point we will abandon the peg like an emerging market that doesn't need to be pegged to the dollar for credibility, but now is big enough to walk on its own legs. I think at some point maybe is the value of if they will represent the value of that economy and they will be the base for the monetary stack of a certain ecosystem.
00:36:14.190 - 00:37:18.254, Speaker B: It seems impossible now, but maybe not in the future. Also considering the inflation data and the uncertainty on the value of the monetary stack we're seeing. But institutions like institutions like Circle, for example, are so important because they are bridging the old world into the new rails. And although I have no doubts that we will migrate completely in a blockchain enabled financial system, I don't know when this is going to happen. And I think if we screw things up, we might delay this adoption by 20 years, which in our perspective, it seems like it's like the same as it would never happen. So I think having incredibly professional and dedicated innovative bridges between the off chain and the on chain economy is the most important thing we need. We have, and I truly hope that the dialogue with the regulators will be constructive because it's so important for the regulators to participate in this migration, orderly migration.
00:37:18.254 - 00:37:51.774, Speaker B: Otherwise it will happen anyway. But it will happen in a messy way and the weak ones will be the ones who suffer. And we don't want this to happen. So it is very exciting. But for me, my call to action is we are not here looking at the future and trying to predict how is it going to be and bet in the capital markets based on our prediction. We are here because we want to shape it. So everyone has a responsibility in the quality of the tweets, in the quality of the research, in the quality of work, not just to speculate, but to create the future we want.
00:37:51.774 - 00:38:01.490, Speaker B: And I'm not an idealist here, I think it's real and we all have this kind of personal responsibility, how we interact with the ecosystem or outside of the ecosystem.
00:38:03.110 - 00:38:17.270, Speaker A: No, I think that's a really well put argument. I wish that was my last question because this would have been a perfect note to end on. I do have one more question, but I want to give Fran a chance to comment as well and we can get to wrapping up the panel.
00:38:17.930 - 00:38:46.702, Speaker D: Honestly, there's not much I can add. Those were two great interventions. The only thing I might comment to is something Nikhil said about how yields are leaving because the Fed is hiking up their own interest rates. And that's something that we've seen a few times, right? When we started superfluid, the yields in DeFi were at zero. I don't know how many people remember that. Even MakerDAO, I think had negative interest right, at some point.
00:38:46.756 - 00:38:47.360, Speaker B: So.
00:38:49.430 - 00:39:51.778, Speaker D: What that tells us, the fact that they're inversely correlated, tells us that the interest that we see in DeFi is purely driven by speculation because there's no actual economic activity. If there were uncollateralized borrowing and lending, then we would have yields, even if yields in the traditional markets are high. But we don't because there is nothing except for speculation at the moment. And I think it's very important to bring those payments on chain to create those markets for uncollateralized lending because that will stabilize yields. If people are borrowing on chain, then there is yield, right? Regardless of what the off chain yields are, right? And that will break that inverse relationship between the yields in DeFi and Treasuries. Which will also mean that crypto in general becomes a real mature market, right? So ultimately, breaking the direct connection between speculation and crypto is the only way we have to make this mature. And I think payments are ultimately the harbor of that, right? Because everybody needs to make payments.
00:39:51.778 - 00:40:15.290, Speaker D: It's the simplest way to bring people on board. And it will bring with it things like credit, it will bring with it things like more efficient supply chains, potentially cheaper everything, right? Because we have more efficient rails for moving value. So overall, yeah, as Luca said, fuel responsibility to make that future happen and work in that direction.
00:40:16.990 - 00:40:35.170, Speaker A: I absolutely agree. So maybe one optimistic note to end on will be just maybe getting a preview of how each of you are kind of enabling that we'd love to learn about what you think is important for Maker to do and for Circle to do and for SUPERFLIP to do to actually get millions more people coming in and be onboarded.
00:40:37.270 - 00:41:36.194, Speaker B: I start with Maker very quickly. I spent an immense amount of energy over the last few months trying to protect this concept of Prudence, because we have a responsibility managing a stable coin. And unfortunately, these days it is quite evident that I was right. It doesn't feel good to be right. And I want to keep evolving, balancing the need for Prudence because I think it is very important. So what we are trying to do at Maker is through protocol to protocol interactions, we want to onboard as much high quality collateral as possible on chain, showing to the world that there is a super efficient source of capital out there that can be used to distribute, to Nikki's point, risk capital around the world. So showing that this value also for protocols that can build on this portable liquidity from Maker.
00:41:36.194 - 00:42:24.360, Speaker B: And if we are successful, the ecosystem will thrive, capital will go into the right ends, not to the ones that want to speculate or originate and run away. Maker will expand and the Dai will be in more hands. And obviously we will be even more important in DeFi ecosystem while staying being composable with others. And I want to stress, for example, there is space because everybody has a different specialization. So we have a very strong and deep strategic relationship with USDC and it's a pillar of our construct. And we think this will remain and will expand as we grow and mature. So I think this is what we're trying to do over the next few months.
00:42:29.590 - 00:43:00.890, Speaker C: I can go. I think for us, we have three broad focus areas. One is we want to increase the programmability of USDC. So fundamentally, we think about USDC as a platform. We think about the platform attributes being liquidity, trust and speed. And that's what we push on all day. That's what frames our entire product effort.
00:43:00.890 - 00:43:34.840, Speaker C: How can we be more liquid? If you want to do something with USDC, how can you do it fast? And then how do we maintain trust at all? So we're going to keep pushing on that. And that just means supporting more chains. We have more functionality coming. And as we do that, we are sort of guiding light is where the developers are. So we go where the developers tell us to go. And there are good ways of analyzing that data and we consume the data and we follow the developers. It's very simple.
00:43:34.840 - 00:44:11.134, Speaker C: So that's on the stablecoin side. And then, broadly speaking, we have two applications that we care about deeply. One is payments. Payments is we're going to do more in terms of increasing value in crypto payments, I think, and supporting various methods of payments for the merchants that we are working with. Merchants come to us today for fiat payment rails. We're going to give them a way to manage crypto rails as well in the future. So that's one aspect.
00:44:11.134 - 00:45:02.370, Speaker C: And then there's like all these accessory businesses around that. And the third thing for us is trying to figure out how to bring real world assets on chain and how to enable those markets. What is our role there? We're still reasoning through it because a lot of this is very exciting, but still very early. So I do agree with Fran's point that Payments is ready today. Everybody needs to do it. It's a great way to onboard people. And the last thing I'd say is one thing I am careful about as I listen about this is I approach everything with a lot of curiosity and not a lot of judgment because, I don't know, there's a funky new liquidity scheme that is really important to the ecosystem.
00:45:02.370 - 00:45:44.566, Speaker C: I'm going to read the white paper, I'm going to try to make sense of it. And sometimes it doesn't make sense and it's just mind boggling to us as to why something should exist, but it does. But our job at Circle is to keep making widgets. That's what we do. And we make widgets for developers and we make widgets for businesses. And I am pretty confident that we have plenty of widgets to make over the next two years. I'm not bothered by the bear market, I'm not bothered by all the noise with the regulation, because fundamentally, I believe what we're doing is useful.
00:45:44.566 - 00:45:55.540, Speaker C: We are reducing costs, we're increasing opportunity, and as long as we can make that argument in good faith and to very high scrutiny, I feel good about what we're doing.
00:45:58.070 - 00:46:02.354, Speaker A: The best thing about that is it's measurable and defensible on chain.
00:46:02.402 - 00:46:11.034, Speaker C: We can see it measurable and defensible on chain. So, yeah, you don't have to believe me. You need to write something that can aggregate the data. That's it.
00:46:11.072 - 00:46:16.940, Speaker A: And it's clearly working. So I totally agree. Fran, last words to you?
00:46:17.790 - 00:46:39.282, Speaker D: Well, I mean, similarly to what Michel and Luca said, ultimately we have to keep building. Doesn't matter, right? Whatever happens in the market doesn't matter. We started the market when yields were negative. That didn't matter. The yields might become negative again, still doesn't matter. What we're doing is useful. It's bringing efficiency, increasing opportunity.
00:46:39.282 - 00:48:04.942, Speaker D: In our case, I also feel we're fundamentally bringing something new, right? So it's even hard to tell exactly what the use cases will be. So the most important things for superfluid are actually very similar to Circle, right? It's keep building for developers and enable those developers to explore those use cases to build those applications that will onboard the users, right? Ultimately, crypto loves protocols, but protocols don't onboard users, right? Protocols for pure rules, for information exchange. We need people to build applications that solve problems, right? What we do is just provide the primitives that allow those applications to create new things, right? But we still need the builders, and they need to build useful things. So ultimately, providing developer tools is the single most important thing that all of us can do. And onboarding developers will onboard users. Because if what we're doing, unless we're all being extremely wrong, we're bringing efficiency, right? And there's no way that regulatory scrutiny or the occasional implosion of ill devised financial scheme will stop this, right? It's still useful, and that's not going to change regardless of what happens outside of the industry. But I just want to echo again what Luca said.
00:48:04.942 - 00:48:42.250, Speaker D: I do feel that we have a responsibility to make that future happen. And it's one of the reasons I think a lot of people don't take crypto halfway, right? You see people fall down the rabbit hole, and the reason they fall down the rabbit hole is that they are seeing future in the making. And that is extremely exciting. Right. It's not like changing button colors at Google. You're literally changing the way the world experiences money, right, and experiences the transfer of value. So there's something about crypto and web free, which is extremely exciting for builders, and building more exciting tools for those builders is extremely rewarding for us.
00:48:42.250 - 00:48:44.026, Speaker D: So that's what we'll keep doing.
00:48:44.208 - 00:49:23.074, Speaker C: There was a time at Google where there wasn't just about changing colors. I know your ex Google, I was early, like mid two thousand s, like two thousand and five Google. But there was a time where the same things happened. First there were semiconductor companies, then there were the Cisco's of the world and eventually reached Google. Then it became about YouTube and it became about the apps. So I think we're following the same path, and I think we're somewhere in the early part of that cycle. But yeah, it's like, I may be older than all of you, so I have seen this movie at least once before, but it's exciting.
00:49:23.074 - 00:49:30.230, Speaker C: It's exciting to be part of this, to be building at this speed, which is I enjoy tremendously.
00:49:31.850 - 00:49:42.878, Speaker A: That's a perfect note to end this on. I want to thank all three of you for taking the time today. So, look, any kill friend really appreciate the amazing, thoughtful discussion, and we hope to bring you on again and have a round two of this.
00:49:43.044 - 00:49:44.442, Speaker C: Thank you. Bye.
00:49:44.586 - 00:49:45.566, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:49:45.668 - 00:49:47.610, Speaker D: Thanks for joining, folks. Bye.
