00:00:00.970 - 00:00:49.658, Speaker A: I want to move on to our next talk. I think I was thinking about how do I think about doing really good segues and transitions into how we change themes or topics, but it turns out that everybody's just automatically making it easy for me by already setting up what the next talk should be about. So Gary just talked about what this actually means in a social context and how do we actually get people to care at scale. And this kind of brings up for our next talk. I want to really I'm super excited to welcome Dylan Field from Figma and Tubador, from metaphorse to really kind of share their opinions on some of the recent events that have happened in the space. We're going to be talking about at a high level, what the value of NFTs are or is. And there's a lot of things going on here, so we'll see whatever we can fit into this ecosystem and in the next 30 minutes, and without further ado, let's kick off this incredible talk.
00:00:49.658 - 00:01:25.190, Speaker A: So we have Dylan and Tubador. Thank you so much for joining us. Not only is it amazing to have you from both of your respective communities, but it's also an honor to do our summit with this anonymous person. This is kind of the world that we are jumping into and that kind of excites me a lot more because this is new to a bunch of us and just great. So welcome. And what I want to do is I want to just ask each of you to introduce yourself and just kind of give us some context into how you got into crypto and NFTs. And I'll start maybe with Dylan.
00:01:25.770 - 00:01:59.166, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, Karthik, first of all, thanks for having me and I'm really excited for this conversation. How got into crypto? I had been really interested in cryptography in middle school and high school, and I'd done some lectures online about hash functions. And people had been reaching out to me in the very early days of bitcoin about crypto. Unfortunately, I thought they were insane and so ignore the messages. And then I joined the Teal Fellowship community and as a Teal fellow, people were really excited about crypto as well. I also thought they're insane.
00:01:59.166 - 00:02:41.440, Speaker B: And so it took me a few revs to get to the point where I started to get very interested and very involved in the crypto community. And that's, I think, why I flipped all the harder when I finally did in my day job, my night job. To be fair, I'm CEO and co founder of Figma, and I really care about how to make it so that everyone is able to be creative and how to make it so that more people are able to participate in the digital economy. And I think that crypto and NFTs and Figma to me kind of all go under the same umbrella in terms of how do you enable creativity and how do you enable sovereignty? And so, yeah, I'm very excited to discuss today. Thank you.
00:02:43.810 - 00:02:58.978, Speaker C: I was with Dylan on a clubhouse chat. The good time show with RT and Sriram. I should have learned my lesson then. This guy is a tough act to follow under any circumstance, so I should have gone first. And Karthik, I'm not a pseudonym. It's just that I look exactly like my avatar.
00:02:59.074 - 00:03:00.022, Speaker A: That's totally fair.
00:03:00.076 - 00:03:42.734, Speaker C: What you're seeing on the screen is what you see is what you mean. I love telling the story of how I got into this space, and only recently because it says very different things to different people. Right? If you're a left brain person, my story feels like a series of lost opportunities and finally finding your boob. But for a right brain person, he thinks, oh, wow, okay, I can skip the first three years of this guy's crypto life and jump straight into the NFT space because that's what it allows. That's practically my story. I was introduced to Crypto by Metacovan, who was an app developer and a serial entrepreneur. So the first conversation we had, he spoke about Bitcoin.
00:03:42.734 - 00:04:07.802, Speaker C: He used a lot of words. I understood all of those words individually. I had no idea what he was talking about, and we didn't speak for the next three years. And that might have been on purpose in some sense. But a few years later, somewhere in 2016, he had a couple of enterprises under his belt. He'd done escrow services. He'd installed like, 100 bitcoin ATMs all over the world.
00:04:07.802 - 00:04:46.422, Speaker C: And then he came back and said, let's do lendroid. And so I jumped on that ship. So I did DeFi for a few years with Vignesh. But then during the pandemic, it sort of pushed all of us inward into the Metaverse. And that's when I truly mean like Gary, we put it right sometimes NFTs, when you interact with them, they feel like, okay, you found your life's purpose in some sense. And that's not because of any how to say it is actually quite profound. It's because NFTs are experience at the end of it, and you start to feel them, and they're so vivid and they're so real.
00:04:46.422 - 00:05:10.878, Speaker C: And me, I'm a wordsmith for a living. I write for a living. I communicate for a living. Finally, I was able to sort of start talking in color, start communicating in color, and that really blew my mind. I was able to connect with people. And this pseudonym that you see in front of you, it sort of dropped into that space without any baggage, with just a whole bunch of metaverse to explore. And that's when the metaphors journey also started.
00:05:10.878 - 00:05:22.240, Speaker C: So, long story short for left brain people, a bunch of lost opportunities and finally finding you. Right brain people, take note. If you want to jump into crypto, start with the NFTs, skip the rest.
00:05:23.170 - 00:06:10.130, Speaker A: That's an amazing intro. And maybe so I had a bunch of questions prepared, but I feel like I'm going to have to just throw a bunch of that out of the window because there's just going to be a lot more just things that will come from your answer. So we'll just dig in and go into it directly. So what I'll do is I want to start off with actually with YouTube adore. So Metacovany yourself made a bit of news a couple of weeks ago by buying and winning the Beeple's 5000 Days or the first 5000 days artwork and purchasing it for a little over $69 million. I actually want the audience watching to you a little bit, kind of hear about how you actually made that decision to sort of get into this. You've talked about being a fan of Beagle for not just from a few weeks ago, but from late lasting.
00:06:10.130 - 00:06:21.894, Speaker A: Just walk us through what made you interested in his work, how you decided to think about owning that as our piece and how that historic moment altogether just came to be from your okay.
00:06:22.012 - 00:06:53.022, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I guess I did see a few tweets on my timeline about that. So bit of know, Metacovin and I metaphors was like it's sort of a coalescence of both of our thesis about the NFD space. That fellow has been collecting NFDS culturally and culturally significant NFDS since early 2017. He started with decentraland. He's now the largest estate owner, single estate owner in Decentraland. He has the Delta time. Triple One.
00:06:53.022 - 00:06:55.178, Speaker C: He has the First Supper on Async.
00:06:55.194 - 00:06:57.298, Speaker A: Art, which is the first work of programmable art.
00:06:57.384 - 00:08:00.818, Speaker C: He has an urban galaxy and so on and so forth. He's been collecting for a while, but then somewhere down the line around March, April, May, when I started to sort of interact with the creators and the artists in the space, our thesis about NFTs being this catalyst, this touchstone for everything, crypto started to converge and that's how metaphors was born. So after a while when we started to think about this, theses, how do we power this engine that we have of NFTs? How do we take it to the next level out of the blue? And this is where Serendipity works in crypto, right? People reached out to Metacovan out of the blue and he said, hey man, I'm doing this. Are you interested? And the weirdest part is that people reached out because Metacovan was a losing bidder in his first Nifty gateway auction. He didn't get the piece. That one went for, I think, $60,000 or something. And Metacovan lost that bid and he just reached out as a whole and then it clicked.
00:08:00.818 - 00:08:44.638, Speaker C: So the shift here was two things. One, the thesis that the future of the NFT space depends on creating experiences around these NFTs. The Cambrian explosion that we're seeing right now is only the acquisition phase, right? People are gobbling up NFDS trying to acquire them, but the real explosion will occur when these NFTs finally start to be experienced in a manner that they were meant to be. And that's where we wanted to go with this. So we decided to buy all 20 of People's single edition pieces. That's a whole other story, but we did that. And then we created these massive monuments across the Metaverse in decentraland Crypto Voxels.
00:08:44.638 - 00:09:13.678, Speaker C: We called it the B 20 project. It's still there. So we bundled all of these 20 pieces, we bundled these monuments, we bundled an original soundscape by Blau, and we fractionalized the ownership into the B 20 tokens. So why people is an easier question to answer, because we believe he's the artist of our generation. We believe that he represents the only thing that is unhackable in this digital world, and that is time. And that's what this Beeple 5000 represents. Right? Think about it.
00:09:13.678 - 00:09:46.822, Speaker C: Every day, 5000 plus days, he sat down and done this one thing. It just blows your mind. And that sort of consistency, almost spiritual level of consistency. And creating for the sake of creating is plus the beauty of it is if you start at the 5000 piece at the top left, the first picture is absolute crap. I mean, people level absolute crap. And then you graduate all the way. You see the journey of an artist, how he's grown as an artist, and how he was able to do these things at the most crucial times in his life.
00:09:46.876 - 00:09:47.346, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:47.468 - 00:10:11.550, Speaker C: I remember a story where he did one in 15 minutes because his wife was in labor. He didn't miss even that day. So this collage or this thing represents a person's life, 13 years of commitment to this one thing. And that's why we believe he's the artist of this generation. And that's why we also believe in retrospect, that we got it for a steal.
00:10:12.470 - 00:10:39.610, Speaker A: That is an absolutely wonderful perspective on how you're thinking about this. And I absolutely agree. This is a snapshot of the 13 years of the progress of who people is now. And I'm sure he'll be extremely happy to hear that. I feel like now Dylan is you're. The act that Dylan has to follow. It wasn't just Metacovin and yourself that made some news.
00:10:39.610 - 00:10:55.280, Speaker A: Dylan, you also made a little bit with the recent sell of CryptoPunk seven eight four. I want to actually have you just talk about what CryptoPunks are, just talk about some of the trade scarcity and describe seven eight four.
00:10:55.810 - 00:11:48.106, Speaker B: Yeah, so CryptoPunks were the first ethereum crypto art project, and they were created in 2017 as well, which is around the same time probably that medicovan tubador were checking out decentraland because I remember checking it out at the same time. That's another topic. I'm very curious to talk to the Metaverse later, if we have the time, but DM, they're created by these two artists, matt hall and John Watkinson, and there are only 10,000 crypto punks, and they were actually available for anyone to claim at the start. And unfortunately, I did not claim them then. But, yeah, anyone who can claim them for free in the early days, I thought was a really cool and pure way to distribute them to the community. And then from there, a market formed and different people were trading them based on rarity. Of the 10,000 encrypted punks, there were only 88 zombie punks, there were 24 apes, and there were nine aliens.
00:11:48.106 - 00:12:30.330, Speaker B: And there was exactly one alien punk that was smoking a pipe, and its name is seven eight four. And I found seven eight four to be complete magnetic. And I was obsessed with it, honestly. And over the holidays of 2017, 2018, I started to think seriously, I was on a trip with my then girlfriend, now wife, Elena, who's also amazing in early the NFT space and now working in privacy in the crypto space. And we started talking about it, and I said, I think this might be the craziest thing I've ever done, but I'm going to put down $15,000 as a bid for seven eight four, because I think this could be the digital Mona Lisa.
00:12:32.590 - 00:12:35.050, Speaker A: Sorry, this is 2018, correct?
00:12:35.120 - 00:13:17.226, Speaker B: Yeah, this is early January of 2018 now, and I had bought a few already, but this is the one that I coveted and care about the most and had most of a relationship with and just, I thought, a very iconic image. The Big Guy accepted. And, yeah, I told some people when I first came back from this trip, and their reaction was that I was crazy. I think that it's amazing how in three years, how much so much has changed about the way that we interpret and understand the Internet and digital ownership and art. But at that time, people just totally didn't get it. And so I was a little quiet for a few years because I was like, oh, maybe this is not the right time. I'll talk to this another time.
00:13:17.226 - 00:13:56.902, Speaker B: And then over the last six months, I started to get more loud. I put it as my avatar. I started to really talk about it more with people. And over the entire period of time when Oakland was kind of a secret identity as well as when it was a public identity, I really felt a relationship with the art piece in a way that was I'd never expected. And I think going through the process of selling it, which I was very mixed about, but I thought ultimately that if this is going to be the digital Mona Lisa, it has to change hands. It has to actually be recognized with value by somebody else. And of course, I was conflicted because I loved it so much.
00:13:56.902 - 00:15:12.990, Speaker B: But I think through the process of selling it, I've actually believed even more that all the conversations and questions about our NFTs art, can you have a relationship with digital objects? Those are just now so clear to me because I think the answers are sounding yes, like, not all NFTs are art, but art can be NFTs, and you can have a relationship with that art when it's digital. And that makes me so bullish on the future of the NFT industry because I think that it's not only art, but I also think that when you start thinking about what does it mean to have a relationship with digital space and items, there's just so much that could unfold there. And as we think about the metaverse, whether it's decentraland, whether it's gathertown centralized decentralized or a medium between the two worlds, I think that there's going to be relationships that form, there's going to be objects that are created. We're going to go from sort of this if you look at the way that the economy develops from currency to goods to services, we're going to see the exact same thing happen in the Metaverse. And that's fascinating to me. And the crypto implications for that are so vast and just so wild that I'm really excited to see what the next ten years brings.
00:15:13.330 - 00:15:42.214, Speaker A: No, that's absolutely amazing. I think you said this, I believe, in a tweet or another. Was it the clubhouse where you said owning seven, eight, or four was a curse as well? And it's just the exact same thing you talked about. There's an emotional relationship that you have with this piece, and you've had it for a few years. That's part of your identity. And for it to be successful and really propagate the message that this actually is a new way to think about art, you have to part ways.
00:15:42.412 - 00:16:18.070, Speaker B: That's right. And you'll always part ways with the Mona Lisa. That'll be part of my identity as well now. But I've signed up for that, and that's okay with me because it's not the money that motivates me. Money is nice, and don't get me wrong, and it's a very privileged thing to say that, but at the same time, I care so much more about, can we make this a movement and can we make this something where creators I see NFTs as a way for creators to have room to explore their art. Going back to what, you know, time is the only thing that's in Hackable. I think it's a beautiful statement.
00:16:18.730 - 00:16:20.280, Speaker C: Medicovin said that.
00:16:21.370 - 00:16:44.720, Speaker B: Medicovan. But either way, it's a beautiful, beautiful statement. And I think that time is also so scarce, and money can equal time. If you have income that will give you time to work on whatever you care about most. And to the degree that NFTs can create that space for people, create that abundance for people, I think the world can really change as a result.
00:16:45.570 - 00:17:17.560, Speaker A: Absolutely agree. And I guess you already brought that up, and I was going to ask you to adore. Let's kind of dig a bit into how you think about metaverse and just the metaverse overall. Could you give us an overview of what metaphorse is? What led to its creation as an entity, or I would say, or as an.org and also, you kind of just talked about the B 20 project, but would love to kind of have our audience know a bit more detail about what that was, how it was set up and what you expected for people to kind of do and interact with.
00:17:17.930 - 00:17:56.920, Speaker C: Yeah, beautiful. B 20 project was done at a massive scale. And one of the reasons we did it was because it was like trying to put together the first computer or the first car. Right? You don't know how all the parts fit. So it necessarily has to be big to see if that thesis worked. So which is why we needed something as spectacular as the 2021 of ones of people in massive, massive estates in decentraland crypto, Voxels, Somnium space and so on. And we had what was called the Metapalooza, which turned out to be the largest ever virtual event in the crypto space.
00:17:56.920 - 00:18:32.494, Speaker C: The thing is, beyond a certain point, metaphors can't take credit for any of it because if, say, 500, 600 people turn up, fine, I'll take some credit. Nifty turn of phrase, great design and all of that stuff. When 2500 to 3000 people turn up for an event, he said, okay, somebody else took charge of this. Nobody told me about it. So that's kind of what happened. It means that people were ready for a certain shift in the way they looked at art and engaged with it. And that was at the heart of the B 20 movement, in a sense.
00:18:32.494 - 00:19:07.882, Speaker C: And Andrew Steinwall described it best for us, it was the first public art project. In a sense. It was like the virtual MoMA with the only difference that you can now own a piece of the museum as well. So when you walk into the Museum of Modern Art and you have this visceral connection with one of those art pieces, all we did was to tokenize that connection. Say I own the entire experience, right? From the step that I walk into to this space to the sound that I hear to the experience that I have in the art. And that's simply what the B 20 token represents. Right? It's very simple.
00:19:07.882 - 00:19:38.190, Speaker C: It's not a utility token, it's not a social token. There's no protocol behind it. There's no roadmap. It just means that it gives you a piece of the ownership of that. And whether or not you have B 20s, you can walk into those museums today and experience those works of art. The paradigm we wanted to shift, like I was talking about, was the way the world engages with art is very unimaginative. You either buy it and flip it for a higher price or you buy it and lock it away somewhere, which is what happens to conventional pieces.
00:19:38.190 - 00:20:18.210, Speaker C: The third part is what we tried with V 20, which is to open up access to the entire world. That used to be how art worked in ancient temples in India or Egypt or in Rome, ancient civilizations. That's how art was experienced. But then a layer of finance sort of settled on it. It stopped being sustainable and B 20 changed that. It's now sustainable and sort of profitable for all of the stakeholders as well. And the moment we realized that was when we worked with 30 people, right, to build B 20, we worked with Whale Street, the team at Wales Street, which did the underlying tech work.
00:20:18.210 - 00:20:56.190, Speaker C: They did the Bundling and the Fractionalizing now credit to Nftx and Niftex who have been doing it for quite a while now. This is not an original idea, this is not a new idea. We just did it at a different scale. That's all Whale Street did that we have Metacast, which is a team of excellent communicators like Andrew Steinwald, Matthew from Scent, Brooke and so on. We had Grow Your Base, which helped us with the tokenomics of the whole thing. So about 30 people in all right, and all of them chose to take B 20s instead of USDC or ETH. That's when we realized, oh, okay, they actually believe in this idea.
00:20:56.190 - 00:21:35.738, Speaker C: It's not just us. And so it was very heartening to see also a community sort of form quite naturally and spontaneously around B 20. There is no official discord for metaphors. We never created a B 20 discord. But now three discords exist. There's one very graciously created by the Whale community, there's one by fans elsewhere, and there's one as part of Whale Street. So all of this is the B 20 story, and this sort of confidence that this enabled in us is what spurred us towards bringing home the People 5000 as well.
00:21:35.738 - 00:21:42.640, Speaker C: If anybody ought to have that piece, it should be someone from the crypto space, preferably not just in some.
00:21:45.890 - 00:21:46.478, Speaker B: I think.
00:21:46.564 - 00:21:48.846, Speaker A: Happy to hear that what you're saying.
00:21:48.868 - 00:22:50.274, Speaker B: Tibidor I think one of the things I've been reflecting on a lot recently is how the question of what is art has always propelled art forward. And obviously that's getting pulled into question even more with NFTs, whether it's people seeing people and going, okay, it's not what I traditionally think of as art or as people saying it's the format. And that's changed. I also think that there's inherent link in crypto, and I think you highlighted it beautifully of art as community and that being a part of the artwork. And I think it was fascinating just to hear you say about how this parallels ancient civilizations as well, where art was also community and part of the community in a different way. And so I think there's so much to explore there, whether it's dows being able to mint things or vote on how art should change over time, whether it's sort of communities coming together to experience art. There's so much there and I'm really eager to see how it evolves too.
00:22:50.472 - 00:22:51.220, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:54.310 - 00:22:55.300, Speaker A: Sorry, go.
00:22:55.770 - 00:23:00.280, Speaker C: No, no, just emphatically agreeing with Dylan, that's all.
00:23:02.570 - 00:24:04.730, Speaker A: No, it's actually very much true because what I was going to ask was this definitely changes some definition of what art is because we've not had to update that definition for the digital world. I mean, it's kind of stayed constant for the last few decades, ever since we've gotten computers and internet to be widespread and mainstream. But also until we kind of had a notion of scarcity, whether that's verifiability or decentralization or anything else, we've never been able to actually get the digital version of the same art to explode or actually be equally valuable or considered valuable. So it's actually curious to hear both of your thoughts on obviously NFTs is not just art, it's a much bigger realm. You hear that about being dows and communities and having much more anywhere from tokenization or fractionalization of these things. But how do you think about programmability? Programmability in the digital world? Like we have smart contracts that can create dynamic pieces. We have a lot of way to think about what creativity is, what excites you in sort of that realm.
00:24:07.150 - 00:24:08.794, Speaker B: Tubidor, you want to start?
00:24:08.992 - 00:24:10.634, Speaker C: No, I'll let you.
00:24:10.832 - 00:25:17.330, Speaker B: Okay. I think in the broader NFT realm, again, I think this framework of thinking about the digital economy as moving from currency to goods to services is something I'm thinking about a lot right now. And I think that if you think about goods, there's just so much that could be tokenized. And of course there's the question of like, what is the advantage that being Tokenized gives? So the advantage that tokenizing a piece of art gives to the creator of the art is that they can monetize the art in a different way, but they can also bring their community together. And if people have the financial incentives to grow the community, the artists will then take off even more. I think that another thing that I get excited about is sort of how do you create productive assets as NFTs? So for example, music rights would be an example there. Now I'm assigning AC comments legally or anything about security, not security, but I think that aside, if you think about a music right, being tokenized combined with fractionalization, you can start to get to actual dividend streams.
00:25:17.330 - 00:26:19.954, Speaker B: And I think that plus some of the things we're seeing with services like Uniswap, which might eventually actually create dividends, crypto is then looking like not a speculative gambling house, but rather it looks like an economy. And I think we are in that transition right now to that final state as it happens. Then I think that the boom and the bus cycles become a little bit less severe and crypto starts to grow in a more predictable way and it gets a lot more interesting very fast. And I think that the bigger trend that the world is going through right now, even outside of crypto, is that we're going from a physical world to digital world. And COVID has accelerated this by like a decade and our entire economy is coming digital. And we're seeing this in figma all the time because all of our customers are these traditional shops that have gone from I create a physical product to like, I have to actually figure out what that means in the digital world. And I think as we get more digital, it makes sense to have currency and to have an economy that's also digital.
00:26:19.954 - 00:26:22.360, Speaker B: And NFTs will be a critical part of that.
00:26:24.170 - 00:27:12.390, Speaker C: Dylan that was incredibly layered, actually. I saw like three very distinct layers, all based on the aspect of programmability. Correct me if I'm wrong. One layer that you described was the experience layer, right? So what the NFT space lacks right now and what a lot of people are trying to build is this consumption stream. How do I consume an NFT instead of just buying it and acquiring it? So that's where the first layer of programmability comes in. That's one of the things you solve by say, creating immersive experiences, for instance, or 360 degree art or monuments like B 20, which you go into. The second part of programmability is to be able to transfer or share an experience without having to transfer ownership of an asset.
00:27:12.390 - 00:28:00.950, Speaker C: Just a fancy way of saying I should be able to rent or lease my NFT in an effective manner without having to transfer ownership of it. So that's sort of already many experiments around that. And the obvious use case is Land, of course, but there have been other uses, too, which brings us to the third layer of what you spoke about. For these two things to happen, you need interoperability across different spheres of experience, different metaverses, and that's when the actual metaverse sort of happens. So you create a consumption stream first, and then you create this ownership layer without having to transfer ownership, just the experience, and then interoperability that connects all of these things together. And then the metaverse is fully born.
00:28:02.730 - 00:28:06.950, Speaker B: I love it. Yeah, I can't wait to get with you more on the metaverse.
00:28:08.670 - 00:28:10.940, Speaker C: You said it, man. I just paraphrased it.
00:28:12.510 - 00:29:10.842, Speaker A: I think what's even more interesting is the way I kind of understood this is these are not explicit distinctions between one or the other layer. All these three are also self consistent with each of the other layers because you can have this programmability also apply on the sharing, on the collaboration of it to generate this piece, and also on what it means to make this productive. So all these things are also intercompatible. And that's what's exciting because now the surface area of what's possible is exponentially bigger. So that to me is, I think, the most interesting piece because there's over 500 people working on cool things with NFCs and they're going to be looking at. Applying programming to create art, and that excites me. So I also want to kind of just have maybe we want to wrap this up.
00:29:10.842 - 00:30:00.490, Speaker A: I wish we could go longer because there's so many things that we can dig into and maybe just this is an action item for us to do where we can have a much longer conversation in the future. But how do you kind of think about essentially what we need to do to make more artists and creative folks, developers, get into this ecosystem more? Any advice? Dylan, you've obviously inspired a whole generation of designers with Figma, Tubador and Metacobin. You've brought this on from the crypto first side and created the whole, I would say the industry on how big this sector can be. How do you kind of think about getting more people in? What should they be thinking about if they're looking to get into this space? And overall, what can they do if they want to be more involved?
00:30:02.030 - 00:30:42.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a few different parts of that. So, first of all, I think there's an opportunity to create technology that is not as complex as crypto typically is. There's no reason why it has to be as complex as it is today. No reason why when you send a transaction, it has to be so scary. I think that there's huge, UX improvements we can make to the ecosystem that'll help bring people that are not as not as technical into the ecosystem. I also think that the ultimate thing we can do to make it so that more people can experience this is scalability. When you have it costs $50 to mint an NFT or more, you're going to limit the set of people that can do that.
00:30:42.778 - 00:30:55.440, Speaker B: And so I'm excited to see the theorem community invest so much in e two as well as other L2s. And yeah, really hopeful for what will end up there.
00:30:57.170 - 00:31:44.522, Speaker C: Nice. I guess one of the powerful tools in trying to bring people inside and what Dylan just described is more creating a welcome atmosphere once people sort of start looking this way. Whereas most of the attention we get right now is around the price tag of NFDS that get sold, typically. Nothing wrong with that. Obviously, 69 million is a big number. It does attract eyeballs. But the other thing we thought we could do is to try and tell effective stories, right? So one of the things we've done right after the Christie's auction while we were trying to process all of it, is to announce this grant of $500,000 100,000 for one storyteller.
00:31:44.522 - 00:32:31.260, Speaker C: Can be a writer, a videographer, a filmmaker, whatever your medium is, split over twelve months. Stipends there are amazing stories in the Metaverse like Karthik just described, 500 people working on incredibly diverse things to build in the Metaverse. So those stories need to be told. And I think those can be powerful magnets for technical people who will want to become part of those stories to build and also to right brained idiots like me who just look at bright blinking colors and are attracted and come to the space. And we need a bit of both. Right? So I think telling these stories effectively and with a conscience will make a lot of difference in trying to bring people as well.
00:32:32.850 - 00:33:26.510, Speaker A: That's well put, I think, just for everybody listening on this. And we'll make sure we advertise this on the event discord too. But matterFirst Fund just announced the fellowship where they're going to be giving $100,000 to five folks sharing their stories and how they can actually make this space a lot bigger and more inspiring. I think that's a really good way to end this. What we'll do is the best thing about we've been doing events for years, the best thing that kind of gets me excited every time is that I know who's participating, but I don't know what's going to come out of it and I won't know until everybody else at that same time. So 48 hours from now is when we see exactly what comes out and it's going to blow our minds. Three years ago, when we started Eve Global, we saw the birth of CryptoKitties.
00:33:26.510 - 00:34:10.440, Speaker A: If I kind of think about sort of summarizing what's happened in the past, a developer hackathon from 2017, and now we're doing an event entirely on an industry that came out of a project. From that event is, to me, a fully good way to talk about and think about what it means when new industries get popped up through the benefit of technology. So I am super excited to see what comes out of it. We'll be sure to tell both of you what also came out of this event and hopefully we'll get you a lot more involved in the future events. So with that, Dylan Tubador, thank you so much for giving us your time today. Thank you, Kartik. We're glad to see what comes out of this event.
00:34:10.440 - 00:34:14.190, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:34:14.340 - 00:34:15.290, Speaker B: Thanks. Bye.
