Sam.
00:07:32.038 - 00:11:01.050, Speaker A: Ram it can yeah, you can. Kim. Sam. It hey. Okay. That's too where's our heart? Everybody's gay I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
00:11:01.050 - 00:12:15.860, Speaker A: I'm sorry. Wish I could stay away from you it I don't know what to say I'll always bend your way fuck, words are hard everybody different and that's okay I don't know what to say I'm not sure that I'm right for this conversation half a smile, walk away again I'm sorry. I don't really get these social cues. There's no excuse for a lack of words, but I'm pretty self aware. But apparently I'm not. I don't know what to say. I've always been this way.
00:12:15.860 - 00:21:49.220, Speaker A: Fuck. Words are hard. Everybody's different and that's okay. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. For me? Some fire diets? Tell me who you see because I think I do want you next to me next to me but does this work? Because I can't get to you I like the chase I know you do too am I just in love with the idea of you? Because I cross a million things would you do that for me? If I could be a parent tight for me I'm pirate diet tell me who you see because I think I know what you mean to me what you mean to me that does this work? Only because we never say what we think we put a perfect wait time don't speak got me on delay because I cross a million feet would you do that for me? It all the red lights across a million seas just to have you next to me would you do that for me? Hat someone to fight me because every sense beginning I can't see where I go my thoughts are taking me deep easy I'm fighting tonight with my dream I wonder dice tell me who you see because I think I do want you next to me want you next to me but does this work? Because when I can't get to you I like the chase I know you do too am I just in love with the idea of you? Because I cross a million steams would you do that for me? Yes, that is for twice if I could be a paradise lam late dream for me some pirate diets tell me who you see because I think I know what you mean to me what you mean to me that does this work only because we never say what we think wait for the perfect way time don't speak got me on delay because across a million feet would you be that for me, SA? Go where I have to go screw geography but would you do that for me? But it's I'm standing alone in the crowd like I lost. I need someone to fight me because every sense being I can see where I go out my thoughts I take deep easy I'm fighting tonight with my dream.
00:21:49.220 - 00:24:33.210, Speaker A: I wonder the streets of Sip and no one is God for me you I try to scream but nobody can hear me surrounded by too many stranger no, it's got eat san Francisco. Are you all excited? Welcome to eat san francisco. If you're a developer and you've never been to web3 hackathon before, you're in for a treat.
00:24:57.460 - 00:25:06.740, Speaker B: Nervous but also okay. I'm kind of relieved because I didn't sleep last night and I wanted to end San francisco.
00:25:10.760 - 00:25:40.236, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody. My name is kartik, one of the co founders of ETH global, and I am super excited to welcome all of you to the closing ceremonies. All right, it's been a long weekend, so let's get right into it. This was a massive event. 1700 people from 46 different countries. 40% of them were new to web3. And not only is this our biggest event ever, this is now officially the world's biggest web3 hackathon.
00:25:40.236 - 00:26:11.652, Speaker A: So please give that a big round of applause for those of you who are watching us on the live stream. I want to remind everybody that this is not a conference. E global events are hackathons, and our focus is on builders. These are opportunities for you to learn, get help, and grow as an individual. And we really believe showing is way more important than telling. And that's what the next one and a half hour is going to be all about. We kind of started this off in 2017 by running one event called ETH waterloo.
00:26:11.652 - 00:26:40.380, Speaker A: It was the only thing that was out there in this space. And over time, this became what is known as ETH global 2016. 18 was six events. We ran six more in 2019. 2020 was four because for obvious reasons, 2020, 119. And then this year, we ramped up everything to do 16 hackathons across the world. And that's what ETH Global became.
00:26:40.380 - 00:26:58.070, Speaker A: Now, we started with Buenos Aires in 18. We got some screenshots of India, San Francisco from four years ago. Singapore, Waterloo. This is Cape Town in South Africa. London, Amsterdam, earlier this year. New York from this summer. Mexico City from a couple of weeks ago or months ago.
00:26:58.070 - 00:27:25.052, Speaker A: And ETH. Bogota at Defcon just about two weeks ago. All these things are some of the communities we've kind of helped not only create, but inspire. And you've kind of known us from doing two things, hackathons and summits. But two weeks ago, Ethgobal turned five. We've been around for five years, and it's been an incredible past five years. I want to take a moment to highlight all the amazing things that have come out of these events.
00:27:25.052 - 00:27:55.748, Speaker A: We've done 40 hackathons, including this 138 different summits that have just brought in educational content for everybody around the world. They've brought in over 70,000 people into web3. We have seen 5300 projects come out of it. We've given $6 million in prizes to people from over 120 countries. We've done 1400 talks. All of them are on our YouTube. People have learned about tutorials and interviews and everything in between, and they have reached millions of people or millions of views and hundreds of thousands of people across the globe.
00:27:55.748 - 00:28:23.088, Speaker A: And this brings us all back to where we are today. Not only that, so many companies have been founded, so much money has been raised from people who've started as hackathon. Projects, ecosystems, bootstrapped, so many jobs created. We constantly get emails from people saying they've been able to get a job from kind of participating in a hackathon. You've met so many incredible people. I know some of my closest friends from E's events. Protocols have gotten so much feedback to improve, of course, the swag that you've all gotten and the poaps.
00:28:23.088 - 00:28:59.676, Speaker A: We've all claimed just some of the immeasurable things that have come out of this, and we wanted to extend more and get more developers into this ecosystem. So I want to quickly talk about two new things that we have launched over the past couple of weeks, and you've kind of seen a glimpse of that already from your hacker dashboard. The first one is Guides, and the second one is Jobs. Guides came out last week. For us, these are ways for you to learn how to get into web3 on your own pace. You can learn how different protocols work. You can learn how to code over time and catch up on all the things that are happening in this space.
00:28:59.676 - 00:29:36.788, Speaker A: These are going to be curated tutorials that are interactive, that you can check out on Ethglobal.com. And if you submitted a project today, you also got early access to the Ethglobals job Board. If you are looking to actually change your careers and get into Web Three and switch roles or get interesting other opportunities, you can sign up for the Being part of our Job Board on your Hacker dashboard. And we'll be reaching out to you over the next couple of weeks to talk about how all that is structured. So we have four more things coming, or four things in total coming, including guides and jobs. And this is just the beginning. We're going to do a lot more here to bring hundreds of thousands of more devs.
00:29:36.788 - 00:30:13.672, Speaker A: But the reason I'm talking about all of this thing is that five years is not a lot of time and we really want Web Three to win at Eight Global. And I want to take a moment here before we go into all the demos and the prizes to really thank everybody that's been here. All the hackers, the mentors, the partners, the speakers, everybody who's ever been a judge or volunteer. I really, really want to thank all of you for being part of this amazing community and we are really grateful on the Youth Global team. So please give yourselves and everybody a big round of applause because we would not be here without you. Thank you. All right, let's get to the stuff that all of you been waiting for.
00:30:13.672 - 00:30:45.852, Speaker A: Eat, San Francisco. This is a massive hackathon. We had 284 projects come out of it and we spent the entire morning judging all of these projects on the other end of this building. And with that, I'm super proud to talk to you about all the things that we're going to show on stage. And I want to quickly thank everybody that made this happen. So especially all of our judges who've been here the entire morning talking to all of you, giving feedback, and really appreciating all the things that have come out. So please join me in giving a big round of applause to all of our amazing judges.
00:30:45.852 - 00:30:58.496, Speaker A: We have. Eric julian liam brian elena mai scott dustin will. Alexis howard ash joseph dimitri devin. Casey Abrams sam elena jeff omar. Evan. Catherine. Linda.
00:30:58.496 - 00:31:17.144, Speaker A: Sarah, tomo and Nikki. They've been here this entire morning. There are some of them are right now in the audience too. And I want to thank you so much for giving all this amazing feedback to hundreds of teams. And not only that, there are a lot of our amazing partners that are on in the building. You've talked to them. You're going to be winning a lot of their prizes.
00:31:17.144 - 00:32:06.660, Speaker A: So to give them also an appreciation from us, please give them an even bigger round of applause. I want to thank IPFS filecoin OpenSea optimism polygon Scale WorldCoin cartesi ENS lens protocol uniswap foundation uma xmtp the graph hyperlane EY mina push protocol live peer aluo zero x apecoin near samujaya fuel tenderly teller dune analytics unlock QuickNote gnosis chain empiric Network, Evmos, Fendora, Midpoint, Triangle, Covalence, samsung, Next and Pool and Swing. All of these companies and partners are bringing in so many prizes and we're going to talk about all of that soon. So 284 projects. I'll stop talking because I want to get to the stuff that all of you have been waiting for. We did 4 hours of judging. We paralyzed everything in 13 tracks.
00:32:06.660 - 00:32:26.304, Speaker A: And through that, we got 13 amazing finalists. What's going to happen next for the next 60 minutes is we're going to bring them on. They're going to demo what they built. These are some of our favorite 13 teams that came from the main judging process. And without further ado, I want to bring them on. Actually, there's more. Bring them on here one by one.
00:32:26.304 - 00:32:55.444, Speaker A: And then after that, we're going to talk about all the prizes that you've been waiting for. So please give a big round of applause to our 13 finalists. We have Mundo Fuelscape BB, three Beeper Dow Consensus mellow vault ORC three Unix ZK section. Nine decentral couch cambria swallow project. Peekaboo and snapchain. These are the teams that are going to be coming on and setting up. And before we go into our very first demo, I want to take a quick second to thank the 271 other teams that are listed here and on the next slide.
00:32:55.444 - 00:33:47.500, Speaker A: Just because you're not one of these 13 teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong with it. These are just some of the themes that our judges were excited to showcase. And I want to give my sincere thanks to all of you for submitting a project, demoing it, and so many of you who are doing this thing for the first time, kind of having to follow that through for the whole weekend and being able to show that and learn from everything that you figured out this weekend is no small thing. So please give yourselves a round of applause for being one of the 284 teams that presented and submitted a project. And if any of you want to learn about all the rest of the list is and or follow up on any of the details, you can all head over to Ethglobal.com slash showcase and you can see all the projects that came out of today's event and all the details from those projects. All right, I'll stop talking now.
00:33:47.500 - 00:34:14.152, Speaker A: Let's welcome our very first demo. That is Project Mundo. Awesome. Thank you. What's up, ETH SF? All right, so we built a project called Mundo that enables cross chain utility for refi. That is Regenerative Finance and tokenized carbon credits. My name is Doug and this is Luis.
00:34:14.152 - 00:34:30.440, Speaker A: I worked on the back end and he worked on the front end. And, yeah, dynamic duo team over here. Before I get into it, for anyone that's not familiar, there is a growing movement in web3 called Regenerative Finance, also known as refi. Yeah. There we go. Whoa. Let's hear it for refi.
00:34:30.440 - 00:35:09.920, Speaker A: It's really awesome. And it's basically looking at Web Three as a new technology and incentive model for solving the climate cris, amongst other things. And so a big part of that is actually looking at the existing problems in the carbon markets. And there's a lot of projects that are tokenizing carbon credits, bringing them on chain and plugging them into the liquidity that exists in DeFi and solving some of the problems there. Some of the biggest projects today, they launched about a year ago. They're on polygon, and most of the liquidity is concentrated on polygon for these tokenized carbon credits. And that means that it's really, really hard if you're on any other chain to interact with these assets.
00:35:09.920 - 00:35:33.944, Speaker A: Right. And at the same time, there's sort of a trade off. They don't really have reasons to bridge it to other chains because that only further fragments the liquidity of an already really low volume asset. And that's kind of the whole point of bringing it on chain. And there's also a lot of risks of individuals bridging those assets and managing that themselves. So we saw those as sort of big bottlenecks in scaling refi in the on chain carbon markets. And so that's why we built Mundo.
00:35:33.944 - 00:36:00.244, Speaker A: And Luis is going to walk through what the product looks like. Yeah. So I'll walk through a quick live demo here. So if you navigate to Mundo, you'll see this is our homepage. We tried to make it as simple as possible with this three step experience. So step one is just finding out what any given wallet address has as their emissions. So for this demo, I'm going to use Doug's ETH ENS here.
00:36:00.244 - 00:36:28.924, Speaker A: So let's find out this wallet. Now, as you can see, we use Etherscan to see how many transactions this wallet has made. And with a variety of factors, like the time when the transactions were made and things like this, we can calculate the tons of CO2 that this wallet has emitted. But that's not all right. Now that you know that, let's do something about it. So step two is kind of seeing all of the projects that you can buy to offset these tons of CO2. And so you can explore here.
00:36:28.924 - 00:36:52.832, Speaker A: We used a two can subgraph, which is indexing all of these projects around the world. So let's go to Brazil, for example, and navigate there. That's where your impact would be heading. And you can actually see the projects themselves. So we select this one. We can see this one has 25,000 credits that you can actually buy, or I should say 250,000. And this is what the credit actually represents.
00:36:52.832 - 00:37:25.004, Speaker A: So let's go ahead and check out here and actually offset. So I'm going to connect with my wallet. And like Doug said, all of this happens, the settlement happens on polygon, but let's go ahead and pay with Celo because that's what my wallet has. This is also a really cool use case where I can offset for someone else. So let's go ahead and do that, and I'll confirm the transaction here. While you're waiting for Cello to confirm the block, let's go ahead and just navigate around here. And when this Offsets, you'll see the transaction on Sello.
00:37:25.004 - 00:37:53.720, Speaker A: We can also see the pending on Polygon. So here, let's go ahead and navigate there. So this is the transaction that just finished, and if I go to Hyperlane's Block Explorer, we can see that this is the transaction that's pending. And as you can see, it went from Cello over to Polygon. And when that confirms, you'll see the actual certification. Yeah, there you go. This is the transaction on Polygon's Block Explorer with all of the steps that we did.
00:37:53.720 - 00:38:17.340, Speaker A: And if you remember, this is the actual project that you bought. So, yeah, that's how the project works. I'll go back to the slides. All right. Yeah. So it works today across Cello sorry, optimism and Polygon. And this is just a really quick architecture overview.
00:38:17.340 - 00:38:56.044, Speaker A: Basically, it plugs into any EVM chain that's supported through Hyperlane today. And we sort of designed the smart contracts. We sort of thought of them as like payment terminals, like you would when you're checking out with a square terminal. So it accepts payments from all these chains and it bridges through Hyperlane not only the value of those assets, but also the parameters for offsetting as well. If you want to retire on behalf of a Beneficiary, all that metadata is available and pass through Polygon, where there's a USDC terminal that accepts those payments and interacts with SushiSwap and swaps into NCT and redeems the underlying credits. And all of that is indexed and then resurfaced back through the graph. Yeah, just really quickly, some future work that we want to do.
00:38:56.044 - 00:39:37.944, Speaker A: We really think that there's social potential for this, both in terms of me offsetting for someone else, but also maybe integrating with Lens Protocol and having some kind of virality there. There's also the issue of cross chain liquidity and thinking about this so that it's a lot easier to go from any chain, any token to the actual offsetting, because we want to make that as seamless as possible. We spent all our time thinking about refi, thinking about how Web Three can be leveraged to make Drive real world impact. So if you're curious about how money can work together with plants and you're bullish on plants, then come talk to us. Thank you. Amazing. Well, please give a round of applause for Mundo.
00:39:37.944 - 00:41:16.296, Speaker A: And up next, we have Fuelscape. Please welcome them on stage. This, of course, would not be a hackathon if Murphy's lock doesn't kick in. So we'll give it a few more seconds and then get this going. If not, we'll swap the teams out and then have them come on again. Just go with the front end. Let's go.
00:41:16.296 - 00:41:38.360, Speaker A: With the front end. I mean, video is not loading. Cool. Hey, everyone, this is our front end. This is where you can actually go to right now. It's Fuelscape GG and generate a there we go. Now I'm using the Mic, you can generate a wallet and a private key on Fuel.
00:41:38.360 - 00:42:26.010, Speaker A: So now we're generating a private key. And then you can link a player name inside of that text input box, like example name, and then you can link your wallet. Once you've linked your wallet, that name cannot be linked to any other wallet and that wallet cannot be linked to any other name. You can always reset your wallet and spin up a new wallet if you need to. But if anybody wants to go to the mobile site, Fuelscape Ggitems, you can do example and follow along with the gameplay. But this is where you would see all of your items. We're minting every item in RuneScape as an NFT that you can trade, lend, borrow, sell and grow with.
00:42:26.010 - 00:43:18.138, Speaker A: All right, shame for the great video, but we're going right into the live demo then. Just in case this isn't clear or what we're trying to do, we were very excited about the idea of creating a video game web Three. We know that the adoption for those type of games is sometimes quite different. So we tried to build something on top of a game that already exists, such as RuneScape. I don't know if there's any gamers out here that have ever played it. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. So the perfect way to do it was to build it on Fuel, which is a super fast virtual machine that allows us to do these transactions on live.
00:43:18.138 - 00:44:06.950, Speaker A: So every time you're doing something in the game, those assets are being minted into field virtual machine as real game assets. So, yeah, let's go through it. So you can see him playing. And on Login, it actually loaded all of these items from the onchain state, not from the server of the game. And if you go to Fuelscape Ggitemscc, you can also follow on your phone the inventory in real time. So with this postman query, he just added an NFT outside of the game to the wallet of the player. And now as he locks in again, it appeared in the inventory as the Blue party hat.
00:44:06.950 - 00:44:45.826, Speaker A: Can you go to the website? Yeah. So basically, we're enhancing the possibilities of playing Runscape on chain, making this game a little bit more fun. And yeah, I hope some of you guys are interested in joining this team and Fuelscape is going to go live soon. So if you're interested, definitely show us your interest and we'll show you the video. We want you to see the trailer of this video. Let's give it a shot. So, on the front end you see the inventory, but this is not connecting to the game server at all.
00:44:45.826 - 00:45:17.600, Speaker A: That's basically just loading from on chain. And the server itself is also just communicating with the chain. So there's no communication between the game. Oh, it's working. Let's do the video then. Ten years ago, hundreds of soldiers would gather virtually to stop Samarak from destroying Kyle and Ore. Now, in 2022, Samuraik has heard of the blockchain and is planning to attack.
00:45:17.600 - 00:45:28.618, Speaker A: This is a call for all suffering citizens to protect Kyle. On chain. RuneScape. On chain?
00:45:28.714 - 00:45:30.240, Speaker B: How's that even possible?
00:45:33.170 - 00:47:04.860, Speaker A: You step one, enter Fuelscape GG. Step two, create a Fuel wallet. Step three, export your private key. Making progress every time something happens in game API, calls will be sent to Fuel's virtual machine so we can keep track of your progress. So keep chopping wood and get exclusive NFT rewards. Upgrade, sell, trade, or use your NFTs to experience RuneScape at maximum fuel. Thank you.
00:47:04.860 - 00:47:28.298, Speaker A: Well, this demo eventually did work, but please give Fuelscape a big round of applause. That's the best thing about Web Three gaming. You get to port all the old ones back in with Web Three primitives. All right, next up is BB Three Beeper. Please welcome the team. Hello, ETH San Francisco. We are future primitive.
00:47:28.298 - 00:47:42.594, Speaker A: And our project is BB Three Beeper. My name is Jaden. I'm one of the Devs on the team. My name is Benny. I was part of the 2017 ETH Waterloo Lot launch CryptoKitty. So good to be back. Hey, guys, I'm Ray.
00:47:42.594 - 00:47:44.120, Speaker A: I'm a Dev on the team.
00:47:45.290 - 00:47:47.960, Speaker B: Hey, guys, I'm Alan. I'm the designer on the team.
00:47:48.810 - 00:48:17.534, Speaker A: Hi. My name is Druzey. I'm a front end developer. So we came to ETH San Francisco with the goal of getting every single one of you onboarded to decentralized messaging protocols. And we did that by launching an NFT. What you are looking at here is the BB Three Beeper, a retro 90 style pager NFT that we have airdropped to more than 100 of you here at the hackathon. Over the weekend, this NFT was launched live on Ethereum Main net to many of you.
00:48:17.534 - 00:48:59.054, Speaker A: And this is what it looks like. Now, it might look pretty simple, just like a pager, but if you click into it, you can see all of the messages that everyone on the beeper network has sent over the course of the hackathon, displayed in real time in the NFT artwork, and you can scroll through it. Now, this is deceptively simple. What you're seeing under the hood here is Xmtp messages sent and broadcast onto lens and then sent via SMS notification to all of the people who have applied for the AirDrop. So that's a lot of people. If you would like to get your hands on one of these BB Three Beepers, this is how it works. There is a giant QR code on the right hand side of the screen.
00:48:59.054 - 00:49:34.520, Speaker A: If you scan it with your camera and hit the send button, send us your ENS, we will gaslessly AirDrop you. This BB three beeper to your wallet. Once you've got it in your wallet, the interface looks like this. You can see the same list of messages that everyone has sent. There we go. There are the messages that you guys have sent over the weekend. If I want to send a message to everybody, I can say hello from the stage and hit send.
00:49:34.520 - 00:50:12.948, Speaker A: Sign a message with my wallet. And this message will be broadcast to everybody who holds one of these beeper NFTs in the audience. Many of your phones will probably be vibrating right now, getting a you have new beeps SMS and this message has been sent out over the Xmtp network, posted onto Lens and broadcast onto all of your devices. So not only can you send broadcast messages via this decentralized messaging client, you can also send direct messages. So if I go here, I can send a direct message to Druzey. Hit send and send it. We launched this on Ethereum, Mainet.
00:50:12.948 - 00:50:30.896, Speaker A: We've airdropped it to over 100 people at the conference so far and we would love to get everybody on board with this. Our goal has been to onboard you all into this decentralized messaging future. That's it. That's the BB three beeper. Oh, yes. And in true Hackathon Silicon Valley style. One more thing.
00:50:30.896 - 00:50:57.444, Speaker A: If you remember having a beeper from the old days of having beeper, you know that sometimes you would just get a phone number and you would have to call it to see what's going on. So if you call the number that this QR code sends you to, you'll hear all of the top three messages that have been broadcast on the beeper network relayed to you over the phone, just like you would have if you had an actual beeper. So that's it. That's BB three Beeper. Thank you all. Amazing. A working live demo that uses audience.
00:50:57.444 - 00:51:09.660, Speaker A: This is awesome. Well, thank you so much. And with that, we are ready for our next demo and that is Team Dow Census. They just went down. You come back on. You're good to go. Please welcome Dao Census on stage.
00:51:09.660 - 00:51:37.428, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Pierre. Hi, I'm Batiste and we're from Paris, France. We didn't sleep during two days, but we're really happy to be there in San Francisco. So we're presenting you dao sensors. It's a DApps update. Framework for DAOs. So some context.
00:51:37.428 - 00:52:38.320, Speaker A: There is a huge growth of Dows recently and they need tools to monitor the DAPs and to upgrade them over the time. Many key features are missing now and the tools that exist have some issues that we need to fix. One of them is concerned decentralization. DApps front end, for example, are most of the times controlled by a few admins that can change the front end so it's not secure and can lead to front end attacks. So what we built is an update process for DApps, making it easy, secured and decentralized for DAOs to do that. So we. Are sharing the update process between stakeholders based on acceptance.
00:52:38.320 - 00:53:37.864, Speaker A: And we'll have a certification that the front end version of your wing has been accepted by the Dao. Some key features of our product. We're allowing a decentralized front end hosting which has been validated by the Dow members on chain. And we also have a browser extension to verify the front end reliability. So basically what we're doing is that firstly the proposer is going to have to get authenticated with Wordcoin so that we can prove that it's not about incident human being. Then if he has a front end that he wants to deploy, he's going to use a Flick, which use ENS, and he'll deploy it on IPFS and then he'll be able to propose a snapshot. After that, the snapshot is voted.
00:53:37.864 - 00:55:04.820, Speaker A: We're going to call the Umar record so that we can bring this result on chain. And then if the result is positive, the Dao can upload, can deploy this front end and then we can check it. The user can check if the user is in, if the front end is indeed accepted with the plugin. So to jump into the demo now, so we're connecting with Wordcon. Basically what we're doing now is a human verification to ensure that only humans are able to do it to avoid spams on the Dow tools. And when it's confirmed, we're going to mint an NFT that will enable us to do the snapshot. So this is done, the NFT has been minted and we can do the proposal on snapshots.
00:55:04.820 - 00:56:09.640, Speaker A: Sorry, we didn't have the snapshot open. So once snapshot is done, we're going to do a request on Uma. So we're going to request the IPF hash. So if this is a test, we'll do them. Okay. Then it's going to be on Uma. We're going to vote for it takes a bit of time.
00:56:09.640 - 00:56:41.440, Speaker A: If this is accepted, we're going to call the function to settle it and then the Dow can deploy the front end. Thank you. It was Dowsen. Awesome. All right, next up we have Mellow Vault. So please welcome Mellovault on stage.
00:56:43.300 - 00:57:18.056, Speaker B: Hi everyone. I'm Tina Brian Malone Moody. We are team. Mellow vault or Mellow cafe. We have created a platform for on chain anonymous voting using zero knowledge proofs anonymous, meaning we conceal which address it came from and zero knowledge in the sense that we can prove that you have the number of votes without relaying who voted for what. So our project kind of consists of two things here. So we kind of limited the scope for now to being able to vote within a specific NFT collection.
00:57:18.056 - 00:58:03.050, Speaker B: So if you have an NFT, all the holders of the NFT can create a multi SIG, which we've called like a vault here, and you can create proposals for that vault. So I'm going to go through kind of like a flow here. So I'm going to create a vault called brian, do you want to type in these things. So we're going to create a vault here. So we're going to put in the vault title and then we're also going to specify which NFT collection this vault is going to be associated with. Here we have like a test NFT collection on Gorely that we've created for this hackathon, but in practice it can be any NFT collection and it's waiting. Okay, now we've submitted the transaction and now it's doing gory things.
00:58:03.050 - 00:58:29.680, Speaker B: Cool. Okay, so while the vault is being created, maybe we can jump back into the home page here or yes, vaults. Okay, so our interface contains like a list of all the vaults that are available. Some of these are associated with NFTs that you might own or not. We are using the graph to host this data. Shout out to the graph. Please don't deprecate your hosted.
00:58:29.680 - 00:59:21.572, Speaker B: Okay, while we are waiting for girly to confirm, we can show like a previously created vault. So here we have a vault that's associated to this NFT collection called Suspicious Strawberry. Here we can see there's already a list of proposals here and then we can create a new proposal. So the way proposals work is you can specify basically a list of transactions that you want to execute if you reach the number of votes needed for the interface. We kind of simplified it and made it so that you can only specify like transfer to transactions. Oh, you can see now that our vault that we just created is now here. We're going to put a very cool description here.
00:59:21.572 - 01:00:04.000, Speaker B: So the description is going to be hosted on IPFS. Everything else will live on chain. Let's say this proposal is going to send five E to that address provided. And so what's going to happen is we're going to create a proposal that's going to live on chain. And then once that proposal is live, then anyone who is associated with or holds the Suspicious Strawberry NFT can go vote on it and maybe we can go to a previously created proposal to see what that looks like. So let's look at this existing proposal here. So we have a proposal to buy Brian coffee for all the hard work he's done for this hackathon.
01:00:04.000 - 01:00:46.780, Speaker B: If you're a holder of the specific NFT, then you can vote. And voting is basically signing a personal sign message and it lives off chain. It's going to live off chain until it reaches the number of votes needed. And then we plug in all the personal sign messages into a zero knowledge verifier and then the proof that you've reached the number of messages needed as well as the fact that all the signers of the message hold an NFT at that block hash that you specified. So we plug in that proof and then that will go on chain. And if it passes, the proposal will be executed. And so here we can see on the interface that we've reached the number of votes needed for that specific proposal.
01:00:46.780 - 01:01:00.524, Speaker B: Here we have sorry, what? Oh, that's the proposal we just created. Yay. Okay. Yeah. We're going to show an example of voting here. Great. Vote submitted.
01:01:00.524 - 01:01:03.940, Speaker B: Amazing. Now we have one or three votes.
01:01:05.000 - 01:01:05.750, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:06.760 - 01:01:07.910, Speaker B: Any other words?
01:01:08.920 - 01:01:25.290, Speaker A: All right, we have another vote in. Okay, so we have two out of three votes here. So that's quorum, it does just a simple majority based on the total supply of the collection. There's only three holders of this NFT. You're looking at them. And so now once we have two, we can execute a proposal. And so this should go through.
01:01:25.290 - 01:02:00.212, Speaker A: Hopefully this vault still has enough ETH in it. But what it's doing now is it is calling the API that is off chain, but has all the signatures that's generating a proof. And then the proof will be sent with the transaction to the blockchain so that it can be verified. At which point, assuming it's valid, the proposal will pass, transaction will execute. And it could be anything like theoretically, this could handle all sorts of different transactions. Our front end is just dealing with simple sends for now to keep things scoped. But yeah, we hope this helps you govern whether it's like it could scale to a 10,000 member PFP community.
01:02:00.212 - 01:02:11.812, Speaker A: It could be just you and your friends who have some token that you gave out. And yeah, we think it should be easier to deal with, own and send money, run a community, run a group, chat on the blockchain.
01:02:11.956 - 01:02:13.320, Speaker B: Okay, thanks, bye.
01:02:14.640 - 01:02:21.900, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, please give them a big round of applause. Next up we have ORC three. Please welcome them on stage.
01:02:30.740 - 01:02:51.910, Speaker B: Hello, everyone. I'm Julie. This is Jason. This is Harry. We're all from USC, so fight on. Is there anyone also from USC? Yeah. Okay, so today we want to present you an ENS subdomain based organization management tool.
01:02:51.910 - 01:03:27.020, Speaker B: So a quick background. Right now there are a lot of web3 community or like Dow, they are using web two solutions for sharing resources like Google Docs, dropbox something else. And there are people that start adopting access control system. That's for Webster community. For example, the Token Gated Assets control. But when we look at the Token Gated Assets Control, there are two downside for organization management. First is that it's pretty inconvenient and expensive.
01:03:27.020 - 01:04:05.212, Speaker B: Right. You need to have the contract deploy the smart contract into send the token to the right person. And that's kind of hard. And the other thing is security. So say if Jason, who are in my community and I'm the admin, but later on he leaves, how am I going to take back the token? There's no way that we can take back the token. I can blacklist him. But Jason secretly sends the token to Harry and oh, Harry now is not blacklist anymore and he has the access to all of our resources that we share.
01:04:05.212 - 01:04:25.904, Speaker B: So ENS can solve this problem and we'll see why. So first, a quick recap. The ENS subdomain system looks like this. It's basically a tree like structures. You guys are all hackers. I definitely know you guys know how this works. So there are three advantage.
01:04:25.904 - 01:05:25.160, Speaker B: First is that it's really intuitive organization structure, right? So for a man they can interact with actually our website, that just drag and draw, make some changes on the access control and that's it. And the second is that it decouple wallet address, admin control and access control. Say the next time if I'm using subdomain name, access control and Jason leave my community, what am I going to do? I'm just going to burn his wallet address from the ENS subdomain that he belongs to mine and he has no more control on it. And the very last, it's so cheap. Thanks for ENS, I use their smart contract. It's only one dollars for all the things that I've talked about. So there are some tech details, but since we want to do showing more than telling, so I will leave it to Jason.
01:05:25.160 - 01:05:30.650, Speaker B: And those are our amazing sponsors. They help us a lot. Thank you, guys.
01:05:34.300 - 01:06:14.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So right now, I'm under ORC three EV. So Aux three E is a company holding by us, and I'm the admin of the Aux three if domain. So I can now go ahead and create, maybe add an intern under Julie product east. So maybe like lastly and then we can get a wallet address for it. So I'm going to just go ahead and call the ENS smart contract. Right now we're on the main net, so it costs a little bit of gas, but as truly talked, it's just only one dollars.
01:06:14.330 - 01:07:10.488, Speaker A: We see the smart contract is running right now, and after that, I have to set the new subdomain to the address that I just set. And while this is running, I want to show you the other part of our project. It's the file sharing system. So each file is shared in the organization, but every file has its own access, like granted to some ENS domain. For example, this ethereum white paper is only granted access to the tech team. And I'm under the tech team and I will be able to view the file. But if I want to access Eve PNG, which is under Product Team, I will have no access to it.
01:07:10.488 - 01:07:35.360, Speaker A: Now let's go back to the organization tree and hit refresh. Well, we can see a new subdomain is created under Julie. Thank you so much. Amazing. Please give him a big round of applause. Next up, we have uniq. Please welcome the Uniq team on stage.
01:07:35.360 - 01:08:24.330, Speaker A: Hi, guys. So we made an NFT minting platform, and the unique thing about us is that we make NFTs scannable because we want intrinsic value in the NFT assets itself. So let me show you. I'm going to make a collection choose a cover photo and just write a description, and it's going to mint some polygon. This is realmatic. You all owe me a can of Coke for this. Let's just wait until it mints the NFT.
01:08:24.330 - 01:09:05.870, Speaker A: It's going to take a while. It's just pending. There we go. So the contract here is minted, and we're now going to create the NFTs, same NFT. We're going to add some assets which are scannable. And once you scan them, it's going to verify them as NFTs. Just a small signature, and we're ready to mint.
01:09:05.870 - 01:09:46.950, Speaker A: Now I'm going to show you the laptop and how it's scannable. And I'm going to just move on to my partner and he's going to just do a quick presentation. Is it? Oh, okay. So hi. What's up, SF? My name is Philip, and what we wanted to build here is to link NFT and assets. And it's like the most trendiest thing on web3 right now, except nobody has any idea how to do it. Well, this is our solution.
01:09:46.950 - 01:10:11.970, Speaker A: Scan to verify. And what I'm about to show you next is something revolutionary. And I'm confident that it might change the role of NFT in the world. Are you ready? I can't hear one more time. Are you ready? Okay. Two identical punks. I see a lot of you're disappointed, and some of you are probably wondering, what in the world is this Chinese kid doing up there? So let me explain.
01:10:11.970 - 01:10:42.182, Speaker A: First, I'm Korean, not Chinese. And I know we look identical, but we're actually different. And that's actually the fundamental core of our solution. Because here on your left is a raw image, but we have the technology called invisible signature, which is pretty much like invisible QR code. And one on the right is scannable for verification. And we do that by using dots by dots, and we make it blend to the original image that human eye cannot recognize. But however, our phone, our application, can detect very easily.
01:10:42.182 - 01:11:18.758, Speaker A: And so what we built in the end is a platform where creators can easily mint signature NFTs that can be scanned for verification. And I'll show you what that means. Hi. All right, as you see, this is our app. And if you click on the peg the asset and just scan over it, it's going to show you the NFT. It's the same NFT verified. And could you just zoom into the laptop here, please? So let's try again.
01:11:18.758 - 01:11:50.800, Speaker A: It doesn't scan anywhere. Notice this image has no QR code. There's nothing. Okay? It has no QR code. The app doesn't scan anywhere. But if you just move it over to our asset, it scans and verifies that it's an NFT and it doesn't scan any other asset. This is the image of the same NFT that we got from a website.
01:11:50.800 - 01:12:46.806, Speaker A: It doesn't scan and it doesn't scan. But the one that we minted will verify itself as an NFT. And it'll also show you the owner, it can be moved on to any other device such as mobile phone. So you can see that it doesn't scan right. But the one that we just minted, if you just scan over it, it scans perfectly. And the cool thing is, if you print this on maybe a t shirt or a hoodie or any of your physical assets, it also scans. So we just want to give opportunities for NFT projects or artists to create retail brands where they can sell products using their NFTs.
01:12:46.806 - 01:13:32.440, Speaker A: And we want to get rid of the counterfeit market because once the product is there, there's a signature and it's unique. Even if there's a similar looking hoodie or a similar looking product, that one won't scan. And if someone tries to steal your unique NFT hoodie, then nobody can really do it because you're the owner and the NFT owner would have to change. What that means for retail creators is it also allows for resale revenue because the NFT now has to be traded when a product gets traded as well. So that's one of the problems that we wanted to solve in the NFT space, is that NFTs don't really have like an intrinsic value. So we just wanted to give utility for all these NFTs out there and for us as well. Thank you.
01:13:32.440 - 01:13:44.410, Speaker A: That was genuinely amazing. Thank you so much and congratulations. All right, next up is ZK section Nine. Please welcome the next team on stage.
01:13:49.810 - 01:14:17.798, Speaker B: Hi everybody. My name is Ting, I'm an artist. And for self introduction, I'm now the first and the only crypto artist in the world collected by a national immigrant. And this morning, when I was queuing up for the main judge, I received a mail and they told me that I won New York International Female Awards with my NFT. Thank you. And it's generated by AIS. So that's why we're doing a project like that.
01:14:17.798 - 01:14:44.320, Speaker B: Suddenly I realized, can I arm my more and more creator people, my friends with AI power? It's a tool that I was so familiar with over the past few years. So that's why we have the project we deliver today. Actually, section nine is from Ghost in the Shell. It's a group of people who are keeping save the world. So that's my teammate Tokwon bu. He's going to introduce more ZK part of our project.
01:14:46.610 - 01:15:55.850, Speaker A: And that brings us to the topic of today. So zero knowledge machine learning for AI generated content. So here's what we did. We first trained the machine learning model to produce AI generated content, then encoded that generation process into a ZK snark prover directly on chain and created a novel NFT based protocol incorporating the verifier that essentially allows AI artists to uniquely mint and certify their creations. And finally, we open source the generalized tool and framework behind everything that is capable of converting almost any machine learning algorithms into zero knowledge proofs that are easily integrable with the blockchain and why is that significant? A artists taking over with films winning major international awards to the right and we really want to bring that two by three community and properly assign credits to art creators, owners and suppliers. And why is it hard? Machine learning models are huge. Normally you can't run that on a blockchain because these are essentially millions of folding point operations which blockchains don't natively support well and zero knowledge proofs are very hard to integrate and operate.
01:15:55.850 - 01:16:48.726, Speaker A: And what I think is the most important part is that the three key stakeholders here don't really talk to each other at the moment. You have machine learning engineers not understanding the tooling requirements to convert an algorithm to a blockchain friendly format, you have ZKP developers lacking visibility into the capabilities of Aigc models and the gaps and creators lacking guidance and support. So I'll introduce our three main contributions. We first train a tiny machine learning model that's blockchain friendly for AGC. This represents a typical workflow for creator leveraging AI model. And then we created a novel method that rewrites all folding point operations in this model into integer only operations which made it very blockchain and DK viable. And secondly, we generated a whole approach into a compiler that translates a model written in PyTorch into Circom which essentially bridges DKN machine learning.
01:16:48.726 - 01:17:58.934, Speaker A: It is capable know with hundreds of components of neural networks and millions of parameters and we open sourced it there's infinite rooms for imagination. What we've shown here is AGC but it can also be used for chatbot writing, assistant fraud detection, reckon resistance and so on. And here's the circuit generated in action. We'll show a live demo right after this and then this is a Circumcircuit excerpt for AGC model all automatically generated. And our third contribution is that we bootstrap the classic ERC 721 protocol to incorporate ML and ZK capabilities to give artists and creators more control over the generated content. So the data is directly rendered on chain which increases data availability and the ZK prover oversees that the image is indeed generated by a machine learning model. Only the holder of the machine learning algorithm is able to mint the model and the broader implications is that converting machine learning models to zero knowledge proofs have profound implications for expanding the capabilities of blockchains which enable people in underdeveloped countries during incomes with on chain IGC or Zkml enhanced trustless freelancing.
01:17:58.934 - 01:19:11.542, Speaker A: And the second point I want to make here is that governance tech in consensus is quite tricky. Our tool can enhance existing approaches invoking a civil resistance by allowing an ML based addition imagining a self evolving doll smart contract powered by neural network and then I'll show a live demo now which is our compiler in action. So this is quite a simple front end. And then imagine you have a neural network which is essentially encoded as a text representation of all the operators in a graph. And then if you supply that around with the parameters, which is essentially a binary file and then our compiler is able to quickly generate all the required constructs to essentially compile that into zero circuit which with the Circum construct we're using, are very easily converted into a smart contract Runbot on chain. And then this is the entirety of the huge circuit all automatically generated by our compiler. I think there are infinite rooms of imagination here, right? Like we can use neural network to detect wash trading to enable a self adapted smart contracts and so on.
01:19:11.542 - 01:19:25.530, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Amazing. All right, next up is project decentral couch. Please welcome the Decentral Couch team on stage.
01:19:38.080 - 01:20:14.152, Speaker B: Hi, we're Decentral Couch, a decentralized airbnb to help crypto natives like all of us to find and pay for crash pads when traveling for hackathons and conferences. Decentralization actually provides many feature enhancements. So portable trust and reviews no strict need to develop a reputation that is specific to a platform. It's all interoperable sensitive. Info can be masked with ZK using polygon ID and there's no middleman fee. And finally, direct peer to peer communication and transaction via Xmtp. So we'll go on to a demo.
01:20:14.152 - 01:20:14.810, Speaker B: Now.
01:20:16.620 - 01:21:05.320, Speaker A: Before we start, has anybody heard of the concept of a couch friend? Raise your hand. Okay, I guess it's not that common. So a couch friend is a friend who has stayed on your couch before, who sat on your couch, and the idea is that your real friends have sat on your couch. And so we take our business really seriously because having people stay over your place is a big deal and requires a lot of trust. So on Decentral Couch, we have two primary ways of verifying trust. We have on chain reputation and we have off chain reputation. We're going to highlight today two ways to book a listing on Decentral Couch one that uses on chain reputation and we'll see that shortly, and one that uses polygon ID to verify off chain reputation.
01:21:05.320 - 01:21:54.576, Speaker A: So here we see the Decentral Couch website. We've entered some criteria for listings that we want to see and we click Search and bam. Through IPFS we've pulled up a bunch of listings and we can see that there's a bunch of on chain reputation in all of the listings such as number of Lens follows you have and also Vouches that are just digital signatures from various addresses. And also just notice that we have this Instant Book button, but that is currently disabled because we have not done any ZK related things to allow it for Instant Books. So cool. We're going to just book a listing now. So we've requested to have a booking.
01:21:54.576 - 01:23:07.350, Speaker A: And on the left side you see a guest, on the right side you see a host. A message has been sent from the guest to the host with metadata about the listing and the ask for the stay. And now on the host side, we can accept that request and we can generate a digital signature that we then pass back to the guest. And with that digital signature, the guest can finally finalize that booking and initiate an onchain transaction so that the booking is done and notice that there was no gas spent until this last step, which is a feature of using Xmtp and being able to exchange digital signatures and cool. We see here that the listing is booked and this is on polygon, and we're just going to have to wait for that transaction to go. Through the sake of time, we can probably move on to the next way of doing these. Cool, so the next way is verifying off chain information.
01:23:07.350 - 01:24:01.204, Speaker A: And in our demo, we're going to verify that somebody has a passport, and this is going to allow some guest to immediately book a listing. For the sake of time, we're not going to go through the process of obtaining a polygon ID claim. We're simply going to assume that in your polygon ID app, you already have a claim. And once you have this claim, you can mint an NFT, which is essentially an access token for being able to instantly book a listing and you could send it to any address. Cool. So we're going to use the Polygon ID wallet app to initiate this ZK proof. Cool.
01:24:01.204 - 01:24:45.728, Speaker A: And then you could choose the wallet that you want to use. Connecting the wallet. Now the ZK proof is being generated and cool. We're going to mint the NFT now and again. This is to an undocumexed wallet, so privacy is preserved. And now we can finally do an instant booking. Yep.
01:24:45.728 - 01:25:06.350, Speaker A: So see that the instant book button is no longer disabled. We can click it and bam, the transaction submitted and we just instantly booked a listing without any trusted exchanges necessary.
01:25:07.890 - 01:25:13.700, Speaker B: Cool. If you liked our project, please reach out to us to be a host or guest. Thank you.
01:25:15.990 - 01:25:26.950, Speaker A: Awesome. I think I know. Billy, eat. Congratulations. Four more demos to go. And up next is Cambria. Please welcome Cambria on stage.
01:25:26.950 - 01:26:13.270, Speaker A: What's up? I'm Will. Hey, I'm Ben, and our project is Cambria. And we have another teammate, Kevin, but he couldn't be here, so we built a cross chain. There we go. Cross chain, one to one sort of representation of on chain activity mirrored inside of a game. So basically all the avatars you see currently in the game are real people interacting with on chain applications, DApps, and protocols. We picked four of the most popular DApps.
01:26:13.270 - 01:26:54.040, Speaker A: As you can see here, we're navigating inside the game. We have ENS sort of resolution. I don't know if anybody recognizes any of the east names here, but probably more than likely. And so, yeah, we're basically just like logging events directly from the chain, like from RPC nodes and yeah, it's basically a real time feed. So, yeah, if you do any on chain action, it's transformed and basically translated into in game state. So, yeah, it's pretty cool. You can basically bring the chain state into your game.
01:26:54.040 - 01:27:22.142, Speaker A: Yeah. As you can see at the bottom, you have filled orders from OpenSea. A lot of people at Uniswap, apparently, and more than I expected at Ave repay. So that's cool. Awesome. Switch back. So why do we build this? We think that web apps are single player by default, and that's more boring than need to be.
01:27:22.142 - 01:28:03.130, Speaker A: If you go to the next slide. If you currently go to OpenSea, it kind of looks like Google Images. You really don't know whether there's one person on the site or 1 million. And we think that social NFT trading is a big reason why NFTs are valuable and they're fun, and we really want to change that if you go to the next slide. So we're building Cambria, a game that basically ingests all of on chain data to make it easy to trade. Hop into game and hop into a clan, chat with your friends, hop between protocols, trade peer to peer swap, and do other stuff in game. I think somebody stole my Runescapes on there earlier.
01:28:03.130 - 01:28:19.970, Speaker A: Awesome. We're launching soon. Play Cambria. If you want to follow us, give us a like on Twitter. Thanks so much. Incredible. All right, three more demos to go.
01:28:19.970 - 01:28:58.154, Speaker A: So next up, swallow. Please welcome them on stage. Hello, everyone. We are Swallow and this is our team. We are our hackers, and we came from South Korea to participate in this hacker turn. And we are very nice to meet you. So do you ever use the Apple shortcuts? Apple shortcuts? We are trying to build a web3 version of shortcuts so users can register their shortcuts.
01:28:58.154 - 01:29:47.082, Speaker A: So it's basically Swallow or transaction in Webstery application. So in the screen, you can see that the user registered the Buy shortcuts. So whenever the user wants to buy token, the user doesn't need to go to the DeFi or send transaction by himself, but just enter the Swallow and just click the button. So this is a Swallow overview, and we are trying to build layer between developers and users. So developers use Jerox API or Dune or other tools and register shortcuts to Swallow contract. And then users can download shortcuts and make some custom shortcuts and pay for the shortcuts. So Swallow is like App Store.
01:29:47.082 - 01:30:22.630, Speaker A: It's a platform for shortcuts. So these are the problems we found. So, basically, non engineer users are hard to execute, complicated transaction or query data on chain. And there are so many sites or services on chains. So to solve the problems, we made Swallow. So in Swallow, users can build their own TX shortcut, TX query or TX Alert. And Swallow is planned to build as a Chrome extension is very accessible.
01:30:22.630 - 01:30:53.202, Speaker A: So, for example, users can monitor their deposit pool's, current API or like what happens in the pool they deposit. So I'll show. You the Rive Demo. So this is a sign in page, so you can enter your Ningname that is mapped with your wallet account. So, I'm going to enter my name. So this is the main page where you can add shortcut. And this is a template that we already built.
01:30:53.202 - 01:31:26.190, Speaker A: And as I said, developers can add freely the templates. So I'm going to add buy shortcuts. So in the Swallow page, users can select which token to buy. I'm going to say I'm going to buy Ethereum, like this amount and by selling Matting. So it's basically swap. So I'm going to add shortcuts and that's it. The shortcut is registered in your page and whenever you want to swap the tokens, you just click the button and it automatically sends transactions.
01:31:26.190 - 01:32:02.114, Speaker A: So I'm going to send transaction and it needs some time. So it uses Gerox API. Swap API behind the scene. But user doesn't have to know what it is or how to use it or how to send transaction. They just have to click the button in Swallow and just send transaction. And also I'm going to add one more shortcut that shows the current APY of Ave protocol. So I want to see Dai and Ethereum and add shortcuts and it shows the current APY.
01:32:02.114 - 01:32:40.210, Speaker A: So it uses the graph subgraph behind the scene, but the same, the user doesn't have to know what the subgraph is or how to build the subgraph, how to deploy the subgraph. The Swallow does do the thing. So I explained all the things. So our future works is to build a builder economy where developer can build shortcuts and build a builder. So builder can earn money by selling shortcut and user can purchase shortcut. So, Swallow as a platform or the layer. We take the platform fee between builder and normal user.
01:32:40.210 - 01:32:58.970, Speaker A: Thank you. And if you're interested in the project, please contact this email. Thank you. That was amazing. Can't wait to use it myself. All right, second last demo of the day. Please welcome Team Peek a boo.
01:33:03.950 - 01:33:04.940, Speaker B: Hi, everyone.
01:33:05.410 - 01:33:35.910, Speaker A: My name is Greg Hyson. And hello, I'm John Johnson. I do smart contract R and D and I've been awake since 07:00 A.m. Yesterday. So this is sort of me in my sleepiest form and I'm going to do my best to describe this. I'm very excited about what we've done here. So we're peekaboo and we did a blind NFT auction with Verifiable delay functions.
01:33:35.910 - 01:34:08.170, Speaker A: So a quick little recap on just how existing blind NFT auctions work, such as the ones that they used to do with the ENS names. The bidder would hash their bid along with some salt. They'd commit that hash on chain and then sometime later they would reveal the pre image and thus show their bid. The downside of this is that there's a lot of transactions that have to happen. So what's better about peekaboo? We have fewer transactions. Only the winning bid is revealed. On chain.
01:34:08.170 - 01:34:40.390, Speaker A: So this results in a lower amortized gas cost and also makes the whole system more scalable. Additionally, all the sealed bids are revealed simultaneously. So instead of the bidders trickling in and revealing one bid at a time, they all get revealed at once. So it makes a better user experience. And then it also Mitigates briefing. So super cool. And I want to mention that this is made possible by the 2021 Tide encryption scheme, which we adapted to Ethereum by putting part of this encryption scheme in smart contracts.
01:34:40.390 - 01:35:30.054, Speaker A: And so that's what we've been up to for the past hours. We are going to do a live demo. Before that demo, I also want to mention that we have peekaboo decks on GitHub. And so you can go and you can check out all the code here and there's a whole summary of how it works. So I'm not going to go through all the slides doing that. Yeah, we're going to try to do a live demo here. We're going to start an auction here and then we're going to have a Python script in the background that's going to make a bunch of bids.
01:35:30.054 - 01:36:02.978, Speaker A: So what's happening here when we first create an auction is it's constructing two things. It's constructing a puzzle and a public key. And the puzzle is a VDF. And when this VDF is solved, it's going to produce a secret key. And then that secret key is going to be used to decrypt all of the bids. So we are doing this demo on the Gorely testnet, and our internet is a bit slow here, so we're a bit limited. Oh, yeah, all right, perfect.
01:36:02.978 - 01:36:41.262, Speaker A: So the auction has been created. So right now we're going to see some bids populate over time. And the way that bidding works is simply a bidder takes the public key and encrypts their bid and submits it on chain. So instead of the traditional commit reveal, where you're hashing it with some salt, you just encrypt it, put it on chain. So we should see some bids coming in here shortly, some fun anecdotes while we wait. Our designer was not able to make it here, so we used the Dolly AI to generate our logo here, and I think it turned out pretty well. All right, we have our first bid coming in, so we're going to have four bids come in.
01:36:41.262 - 01:37:19.674, Speaker A: And so, as you can see, the event that's submitted, it's a sealed bid, it's encrypted, and we can go over here and refresh an Ether scan to see them coming in. Similar to existing Commit reveal schemes, you send in an obfuscated amount of ETH, so that's the actual bid, and then just some amount to throw people off, and then that obfuscation amount will be returned at the end of the bid. All right, we've got our second bid coming in. I should have lowered the number of bids for the demo, but we're going to have four of these coming in. Yeah. All right. We've got three coming in.
01:37:19.674 - 01:37:39.698, Speaker A: So a bit about the Tide encryption protocol. It's very cool. So it combines, I believe, the RSA encryption schemes. So it's asymmetric you have a public and a private key, and then I believe they use the T Squarings VDF. There we go. Okay, cool. All right.
01:37:39.698 - 01:38:03.500, Speaker A: Yeah. So all four in. Okay, so what's happening right now in the background is the puzzle is being solved. And as soon as that puzzle is solved, it's going to reveal the bid. Okay. So it's now able to close the auction because the puzle has been solved, and soon enough, we're going to see the transaction come through. This is the cool part.
01:38:03.500 - 01:38:23.234, Speaker A: Just wait. So what I was mentioning earlier, the cool part about this scheme is that all of the bids are revealed simultaneously. So instead of seeing them trickle in, you get them all at once. Much better. UX. For everyone, the demo works. We're all going to go to bed now.
01:38:23.234 - 01:39:12.050, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Awesome. All right, with that, we are ready for our last demo of the day. So without further ado, let's welcome Snapchain. Hello, San Francisco. Thank you for taking the time here to learn more about Snapchain. At Snapchain, we're building a decentralized infrastructure for Ephemeral apps and use cases.
01:39:12.050 - 01:40:07.130, Speaker A: So the problem that inspired us to create Snapchain in the first place is that existing smart contract blockchains cannot be deleted. Certain data on the ethereum blockchain exists indefinitely. Dead contracts still eat up resources, and we need to get rid of them. So here at Snapchain, our team's mission is to rid web3 of such contracts to provide a more conducive environment for new and exciting contracts. What Snapchain is, we are a permissionless peer to peer network to seamlessly create and manage Ephemeral blockchains. Using our solution, users can spin up blockchains with one click, indicate a desired time to live, that destroys itself at expiration. And to best suit the blockchain, use case and application to save costs, processing power, and storage capacity.
01:40:07.130 - 01:40:48.068, Speaker A: And let's get right into the product demo. All right, so now we are starting a PGP network, and this is built from scratch using the Lib PGP library. And this is the network for the infernal blockchains. I'm going to start. Two PTP nodes connect to each other from different servers. And this is the first node. And it started.
01:40:48.068 - 01:41:19.410, Speaker A: And now we start the second one using the multi address from the first node. And then you can see they are connecting. And while waiting for the node to connect, we can see this is the existing chance. So we already have two chains on the node. So on both nodes, you can see those are the two different directories. Let's see. All right, wait a second.
01:41:19.410 - 01:41:43.330, Speaker A: Okay, let me see. Sorry. No, sorry. There are some issues. Okay. Server. Sorry, wait some second.
01:41:43.330 - 01:42:11.190, Speaker A: Server. Two all right. That's oh, it okay. Let me copy this. Mr. Character. Put a one at the end.
01:42:11.190 - 01:42:55.294, Speaker A: Okay, I think I okay now. It's discovered the first node, and we are waiting for them to connect. So hopefully this will work. Okay, they are now connected to each other, and I will hand over to the front end. So once the user's MetaMask is connected to our solution, there does access a dashboard where they can see all the blockchains that they created. To create a new blockchain. They simply click Create New chain, and from here, they indicate the desired time to live.
01:42:55.294 - 01:43:34.332, Speaker A: The network name the currency, and sign off this transaction over onto the MetaMask. Once this happens, the front end then deposits tokens into the optimism contract. The contract will then send out a receipt back to the front end. The front end then makes an RPC call to the Snapchain's peer to peer network. And each of these peer to peer network node spin ups their EVM node and broadcasts the message throughout the network. You'll see it populate. Yes.
01:43:34.332 - 01:44:11.750, Speaker A: So with these newly created blockchains, you can see one that's alive. If it's service use, you can go ahead and delete it, which then stops the creation of the blockchain of the blocks, and it will refund for the time that's remaining. Once a block or a blockchain is stopped, is manually stopped or expires, there's a mandatory seven day grace period for auditing and security purposes. And after those grace periods is done, the chain is then destroyed. Awesome. Yeah. So we have a lot more that we want to add to the roadmap.
01:44:11.750 - 01:44:49.366, Speaker A: Those are some immediate things that we want to bridge assets to other EVM chains. We want to add an in card blockchain Explorer. Some future iterations, get as much customizability as possible to the chain. That's including adding more time to live, changing the chain size, and adding a kill switch on the bridge. In general, we think the best use cases for Snapchain will be for any application looking to launch a testnet very easily. This is the easiest way to launch a testnet. If you're a Web Three game and you care about only the final transactions or any, this is the great way to save space on clients.
01:44:49.366 - 01:45:13.982, Speaker A: And most excitedly, we think we can be a design space for the next generation of Web Three social media and messaging apps. So if you're trying to build the next Snapchat, trying to build the next Be real, come talk to us. We think you can use our service. Thank you, everyone. Awesome. Well, those were our 13 finalists.

So you can just go on to your own projects and just refresh that page and you'll see what you have won. You can also see in aggregate what you've won in total, a lot of amazing projects here and congratulations to everybody that built something this past weekend.
01:57:36.560 - 01:58:16.456, Speaker A: So a quick note on the delivery before I close everything off. Everything is tentative and not final, which means that we will be verifying that nobody cheated or coded something before this Friday. So please remain patient for that. It'll takes us about two weeks to go through all of these 300 projects and some of these things will change, which means that if somebody won a price pool and somebody was disqualified, then that amounts will change because then you will get more. So the expected timeline for all the prize delivery is going to be 25 November. So give us a little bit more time, but you can see all the details of what prizes you've won on your own project page. Now, before we close this, let's say some amazing thank yous.
01:58:16.456 - 01:59:02.030, Speaker A: I'm going to make all of you clap a lot for the next few slides. So let's show all these people a massive appreciation of their time. A lot of people make this happen. So I want to start off with all of you amazing hackers, 1200 of you in this building working on projects on a weekend that you're excited about. This would absolutely not be possible without you. And I want to thank all of our amazing judges who talked to all these projects and gave amazing feedback. Then all of our mentors and volunteers who were here 24/7, making sure everybody was unblocked, all the amazing speakers who did workshops and talks and keynotes and interviews and the hundreds of partners that are here making sure that you get to go right into building the things that you're excited about.
01:59:02.030 - 01:59:41.300, Speaker A: Hundreds of people behind the scenes putting all this in front of you. And a special thank you to Rory, who was our volunteer lead, running around making sure that nothing was on fire. Thank you so much, Rory. And lastly, I want to give a massive shout out to Chloe, Kevin, K. Kevin, Ivan, Kree, Huichi, Minnie, Anna, Moaz, Luke, Emily, Andrew, and Jacob from the ETH Global team, who make sure all these things go as smoothly as they can and you have the best possible experience for all these events. All right, before I stop talking and let you all sleep, let's talk about the finalists. 13 teams showed up on stage.
01:59:41.300 - 02:00:20.724, Speaker A: We call them our finalists because if you've been to an ETH Global event before, you'll know this. But if you haven't, I'm going to say that again. We really don't want these events to be competitions. These events are a place for you to learn what's happening in web3. These events are a way for you to experiment with what's happening and effectively try before you buy and really explore if this is worth your time or the next few years of your life. And as a result, anybody that is a finalist is officially a first place winner. We don't have 1st, 2nd, third at any of our events, so I want to bring well, I'm super excited to say that all 13 of these teams officially came first.
02:00:20.724 - 02:00:47.612, Speaker A: And as part of being a finalist, in addition to any prizes they've won, east Global will be giving $1,000 to every team member that came on stage. So congratulations to all of these teams. On to my left and right. This is very much the end of eat San Francisco. And before we get up and stop listening to me, let's talk about a couple things that are next. We have two more hackathons that we're doing. Our next one is in two weeks.
02:00:47.612 - 02:01:19.752, Speaker A: This is an online event called Hack Fevm. It's all going to be about the launch of the Filecoin virtual machine. So if you're trying to make interesting things happen on a computing, on storage, this is going to be the event where you get to try that out. This is going to be all online, so you can just sign up on this and work from wherever you are in the world. And our last event of the year is going to be Asia's biggest hackathon in India, Bangalore. So if you're around, if you're interested in being in this one. You can see us in ETH, India, in just a few weeks.
02:01:19.752 - 02:03:03.960, Speaker A: And after that, we'll be announcing everything that's happening in 2023. So you can find out all these details on Ethglobal.com. You can sign up for all these things anytime, starting now. And thank you so much for being here. Let's party as an after party behind us, and I really appreciate all of you being here this weekend.
