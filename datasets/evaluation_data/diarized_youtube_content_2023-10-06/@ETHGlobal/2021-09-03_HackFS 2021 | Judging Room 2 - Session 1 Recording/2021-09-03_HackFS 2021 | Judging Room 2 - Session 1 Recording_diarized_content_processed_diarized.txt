00:00:02.130 - 00:00:43.090, Speaker A: You. Okay, so for this hackathon, we have 650 hackers from 61 countries and 18 different time zones. So basically for the presentations, each team will have four minutes for their little video demo. And then following that, it'll be three minutes for a Q and a session with the judges. And after six, eight teams will go on like a ten minute break. So in terms of criteria, you'll be judged on technicality, originality, practicality, UI, UX, and DX. And then there will also be a thing called wow Factor, which is just like anything that can maybe surprise the judges.
00:00:43.090 - 00:01:24.670, Speaker A: This is just a reminder that it isn't a competition and people are just here to learn and maybe develop new types of technology. And so these will be our judges for today. And if you want to introduce yourselves sure, I'll go first here. My name is Morgan Mascalik. I've got an organization called Deepsex. I'm into blockchain technology, things leading us with longevity, really interested in the environment, and I call myself somewhat of a pseudo artist, so really interested in hackathons in general. And I think the collective culture of hackathons is a beautiful thing to appreciate.
00:01:24.670 - 00:01:36.850, Speaker A: I love that. I love hackathons. I love seeing what people have built. I love the scrappiness. I love the prototyping and the rawness. Hi, I'm Austin Griffith. I'm a builder on ethereum.
00:01:36.850 - 00:02:03.580, Speaker A: I focus on tooling and developer education and developer onboarding. Just trying to see lots of really cool generic components get built in the space. So it's really easy to build your next product or hackathon project on Ethereum. Thanks for having me. All right, thank you for that. And now we'll get started with our demo. So here we go.
00:02:03.580 - 00:03:27.008, Speaker A: Cameron, if you can promote the next team I'm so sorry, I totally forgot. I didn't realize. All right, 1 second. Give me a second. Sorry, give me a second. You can go ahead and get started. Team defy together.
00:03:27.008 - 00:04:09.438, Speaker A: Moon together. If there's audio playing, you need to click on a Share audio setting because we can't hear it right now. My bad. How about this? You may have to stop sharing and then reshare. There's like a little setting when you Share screen to share the audio also. Okay, cool. No sound.
00:04:09.438 - 00:04:15.586, Speaker A: Still no audio sound right now. Oh, man. Did you select the little button that.
00:04:15.608 - 00:04:17.170, Speaker B: Says Share Computer Audio.
00:04:19.590 - 00:05:00.314, Speaker A: In the bottom left corner? Share sound right there one section first. And then we're going to go a demo with some tech integrations. So DeFi together, moon together. The idea is you can get a bunch of people who can invest in DeFi and do it in a way that is safe and doesn't require trust with the friends involved. So no rug pulls. Now this is the onboarding flow. What the person is going to do is they're going to set up innosis safe with themselves as an owner.
00:05:00.314 - 00:05:20.322, Speaker A: That's what will happen here. Create wallet, then they will add the modules. Modules are custom business logic that will impact the user experience. So here we have rage quit. Add a new member. These are defaults add. A new member is quite simply a new person that joins the group has to add a proportional amount of capital, vice versa.
00:05:20.322 - 00:05:51.070, Speaker A: Rage quit means someone can leave the group and when they leave they will get their share, basically their proportion of funds invested back. But then we've got stuff like Dynamic Protein. You can take various chat app type features and bring this into the mix. Stuff like kicking, for example. All right, here the owner will set the amount of starting capital. So for our example, we're just going to use one ETH. This means that new members invited here will have to send one ETH before they can add themselves as an owner.
00:05:51.070 - 00:06:38.906, Speaker A: All right, so we've got one join, two pending and then we are just going to go to get a home page. So our friends have been invited, the balance of the wallet is for ETH and now we're going to look at the proposed transaction flow. So proposed transaction basically select what you want to do from the drop down menu that will have various DeFi integrations and then set a rationale. So this rationale will be saved to IPFS bioservic. And yeah, it's that straightforward, but we're going to look. Now what happens when a transaction has got three or four signatures required and the last friend can basically go into the details and see this conversation around the transaction. So yeah, that is super safe.
00:06:38.906 - 00:07:22.018, Speaker A: Two of his friends agreed. At this point the user can leave a comment and then sign and confirm or reject it. So in this case, the user is going to sign and confirm and the transaction will go through updating the total balance of three E and one Ave Wet. So that was the concept. What we have here using Scaffold ETH is the tech integration between the Nosisafe and ceramic. So I've already added my wallet address as a code is one. We've got starting capital that will basically send the initial amount of capital to the nose to Safe.
00:07:22.018 - 00:08:27.554, Speaker A: Already sent some funds in and out at the moment, invite friends. So what I can do is let me just get a random wallet address and the new threshold for signing. I'll make that two. All right, so we've added that wallet address as another potential co owner and we can now post a proposal transaction so we can send money to say this signed an address and rational say try and submit. So what we'll do is we'll see this, there's a signature missing. So we haven't built that into our demo to basically handle the extra transactions or the extra signatures, but it does mean that's working. So that's good.
00:08:27.554 - 00:09:02.682, Speaker A: And then here is just a brief demo of using ceramic. So we have another page where we're just testing out the ceramic integration. All right, so what I can do here is just test it out. When I submit this, you'll see we've got a ceramic Identifier here and then we've also got a specific stream ID. Cool. And that's I'm going to cut it short over. Okay, thank you.
00:09:02.682 - 00:09:31.174, Speaker A: And now we'll have three minutes for Q and A. You know, I love this. This is like something like we're building with Scaffold e two. Did you use Veraza Starter Kit or did you have to kind of roll your own? No, totally. So start off with Veraza Starter kit and then the adding new owner was something that Flying Optopia worked on. And also there's ceramic based chat there. Is that right? Did I catch that last bit? So it's not just transaction proposal, but there's some kind of chat going on.
00:09:31.174 - 00:09:59.770, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's actually where we spent majority of our time and majority of struggle. So we started using the IPFS component initially, but then we had this issue of like so Ramming's got something in the pipeline. So allow nursesafe to basically be the owner of a data stream and then the various co owners of a safe can write it. Unfortunately, that wasn't ready. So we experimented first with using the key as Identifier. Then we went to using each individual owner as writing their own stream.
00:09:59.770 - 00:10:32.680, Speaker A: So we were kind of messing around with that. But I think that's not something that we could, in the time frame, figure out on how to execute to kind of get this more chat like experience. What we have is like, basically everyone can just write on the stream so long as they are a co owner of the safe. I'm so excited for Nosisafe front ends. I think that there's going to be so much innovation that's going to happen on top of any key insights there for me as I go forward. Kind of making these for more developers. What may be something that was like, oh crap, I didn't expect that to happen and it fell apart or something.
00:10:32.680 - 00:11:02.146, Speaker A: Well, Modules is really like where you get that custom user experience. So you can get like a vanilla nosisafe and it's a multi SIG. It does what says on the box. But yeah, you can create this custom business logic which will turn it from a multi SIG to something that resembles a chat app or something that resembles like a high end DeFi application to do treasury management, so on and so forth. So integration with Modules, which as you know, like, Oren's working on that. So I think you're ahead of the game in terms of integration. Awesome.
00:11:02.146 - 00:11:31.114, Speaker A: That's great to hear, great build, really cool. I love the fact that you can sort of manage things with DAOs using Gnosisafe and the fact that you've built a little bit of a UI. I'm curious to know if you're interested in other chat platforms or if you plan to build out your own UI UX with the I think you use a starter kit there. Really cool. Yeah. I mean, my background, I actually used to work for WeChat, and then I worked with Status Im. I've dreamed about it pretty much from day one.
00:11:31.114 - 00:12:32.670, Speaker A: My origin story is, like, frustration with WeChat and the banking APIs, and that's how I got into Ethereum. So 100% thought about doing some different iterations of the chat experience, but using decentralized technologies with regards to interface, we really didn't get to that. Basically just using the and components with Scaffold e to kind of make it more a reddit type UX of like commenting, posting and commenting. But yeah, there's definitely a lot of room for different types. If we put a module into a starter kit, what's a super simple? Like, how about spending limit module or something like that? Is there like a default really obvious module that would be good to ship with a starter kit? Yeah, I mean, there's a few already written, so if you check out Token, Walk is making a bunch specifically for Dows. Oren with Zodiac is doing a bunch also specifically with Dows. Actually, the one that Ogeki did, we can chat offline, but there's a bunch.
00:12:32.670 - 00:13:08.024, Speaker A: Great build. Thanks a lot. Really enjoyed the experience. Thank you for that. And just a reminder that when your presentations are done, our admin will demote you, and then you'll either stay in the zoom and watch, or you can just leave. And then our next team up will be Team Theory. I don't know.
00:13:08.024 - 00:13:14.444, Speaker A: It may be me or I'm lagging a bit. It seems that when I press promote, unless it's working now.
00:13:14.482 - 00:13:15.132, Speaker C: Okay, never mind.
00:13:15.186 - 00:13:15.790, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:13:27.160 - 00:13:30.710, Speaker D: Yeah. Hi. Did you call the next team to start?
00:13:34.790 - 00:13:38.770, Speaker A: Team Theory is up right now. If that's you, then can you guys go ahead? Screen Share.
00:13:38.920 - 00:13:44.440, Speaker D: Yes, it is me, but for some reason, I don't see two of my other teammates here.
00:13:45.770 - 00:13:47.960, Speaker A: Do you see them in the attendees list?
00:13:53.450 - 00:14:03.930, Speaker D: Oh, actually, no, I do see Ben. Yes.
00:14:04.080 - 00:14:12.000, Speaker A: If one of you guys could just screen Share and then start the video, unless your greenmates are, like, in the zoom, then I don't think we can do.
00:14:16.930 - 00:14:21.300, Speaker D: Cool. Okay. Yeah, I've got my video ready.
00:14:23.430 - 00:14:29.570, Speaker A: Oh, wait, I think someone just joined Cameron. Can you promote them? Sydney? Is she in your group?
00:14:29.640 - 00:14:31.458, Speaker D: Yes, Sydney is.
00:14:31.624 - 00:14:35.730, Speaker A: Okay, maybe we can wait 30 more seconds.
00:14:35.810 - 00:14:37.174, Speaker D: Yes, that'd be cool.
00:14:37.292 - 00:14:37.960, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:41.290 - 00:14:58.140, Speaker D: Oh, their Internet cut out. Okay. But yeah, I think they're coming back in 20 more seconds. Just waiting for our full stack developer to come. Definitely.
00:15:01.310 - 00:15:05.278, Speaker A: That's okay. On my end. I'm just enjoying some hummingbirds come by, so I'm cool to wait.
00:15:05.444 - 00:15:06.400, Speaker D: Oh, thanks.
00:15:10.530 - 00:15:15.620, Speaker A: That's awesome. What? Never mind. Hi, guys. Really sorry about that.
00:15:17.270 - 00:16:02.568, Speaker D: Okay, cool. I can share my screen. I'm going to be sharing my screen, and I'm going to be sharing my computer audio. Hello, Hackath. This is Ferry, a UX friendly Web Three file transfer tool built on IPFS filecoin. Quite simply, our tool sends files from one person to another, similar to other Web Two tools you have used before, but now decentralized millions of people depend on centralized file transfer tools every day, which proves the need for a decentralized alternative. The Web Three ecosystem needs solutions that let people migrate from Web Two without even realizing it.
00:16:02.568 - 00:16:55.844, Speaker D: Ferry provides a familiar workflow for file transfers, one that mirrors what people are already comfortable with. Ferry is the ideal tool for anyone who wants to use this tool for work as a tech industry, freelancer journalist or creative who needs to send files that are larger than the usual email size. So how would this work? Ferry leverages content addressing to minimize our storage usage, and we pass these savings on to our users. We are using Versaille and Magic to create a did for our users. For upload, we are building on Protocol Labs's new Web Three storage service to store our users files. Through this, we can give the user temporary storage space where they can get access to space for free to send their files. They can get more storage space and longer file persistence.
00:16:55.844 - 00:17:45.716, Speaker D: With a paid subscription, we can periodically reclaim storage space on the free tier of the system in order not to be wasteful. This ecosystem is made up of four contracts deployed on polygon's testnet. Two of these make up the Governance token ship and its staking rewards module. The core Ferry contract handles payments, pro subscriptions and integrates with Aave to earn yield by lending out the Protocol's Dai. The fourth contract is the NFT Minto, which integrates with Chainlink and Zora to bring true randomness to the rarity of our NFTs, a gift for any pro members who subscribe for a month or more. So let's get into the demo. Let's start off with how anyone can just pick up this tool and start faring files immediately without any subscription or payments.
00:17:45.716 - 00:18:37.080, Speaker D: Step one they will log in and create an account with a did using a magic link. After the file is uploaded on IPFS, we get its content address, which we can use to create an IPFS gateway which can be used as Is or emailed to the user's recipient. After this, all we need to do is ferry it. Lastly, the receiver will get an email and download their file like this. Easy and done. Now for the paid version, let's jump to after the login step and connect a wallet. So here we connect a wallet in order to buy a subscription.
00:18:37.080 - 00:19:26.970, Speaker D: Our users get more storage for less cost, but more importantly, they get freedom from the cloud storage provider homogeneous. On the dashboard is where we can see a list of all links generated. We can see how much space we have left and check how many Governance Tokens we have and which NFT we have been issued. These gifted NFTs will unlock more rewards in the future. This is how we plan to create incentives for use of our tool. For more on our roadmap, you can see here or go to our deployed website at this address. We hope we see all hackaths, hackers and organizers using Ferry as soon as possible, so that when they have files to transfer, they can simply ferry it.
00:19:32.560 - 00:20:06.650, Speaker A: All right, now you guys will have three minutes for Q-A-I just want to say I really love the UI. You guys did an amazing job with gradients. It's very pleasant from the perspective. And also the sort of flow that you've took us through I found to be quite incredible. So kudos to that. I wanted to know if you had any issues with Web Three storage or see implementations with the certain specific use cases you might be looking at. Other than what you mentioned, I must say the developer experience was amazing.
00:20:06.650 - 00:20:30.770, Speaker A: It worked really well. I guess the only issue we ran into was that the ability to delete files through the Web Three storage clients. The JavaScript client hasn't been implemented yet, but I'm actually planning on making a PR to do the last piece of it myself. So maybe that'll hurry it up. But besides that, it works like a dream. Great to hear. Good job.
00:20:30.770 - 00:21:05.416, Speaker A: Okay, so zooming in on that design a little bit. The UI is beautiful. What does your stack look like to build that app? What did you guys use? So, yeah, we're lucky to have some fantastic UI designers who figured out how it should work visually in Figma. And then we built this using Next JS, which is a react framework. And then we deployed it with Vercel. It actually also heavily leverages Vercel's serverless functions feature. So it essentially has separate APIs for each of the things like login, log out, upload a file, et cetera.
00:21:05.416 - 00:21:35.510, Speaker A: And magic for the wallet. Right? Magic for the magic email to generate a having. So we essentially have a list of users in fornadb, but instead of having usernames with passwords, we just have emails. And there was one curveball you threw in there about there's an NFT with VRF randomness. I get the file and I get that we're sharing the file and I get that we're logging in. But what does the NFT do? What is that? Where is it?
00:21:36.920 - 00:21:59.900, Speaker D: That's to drive adoption and use of the app. So we want to kind of incentivize people who buy a pro subscription that they can get. An NFT will be randomized. There's four Rarity tiers, and based on the Rarity tiers, people can be Airdropped governance tokens when we launch to Mainnet. But Ben, did you have more ideas about the NFTs?
00:22:00.560 - 00:22:34.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you pretty much touched on it. Basically just we wanted to create a really nice package for our Pro subscribers, so we wanted to put a bit of effort into the NFT experience. It's using chainlink's VRF to ensure the randomness and rarity and then it's also minting through Zora. So then it's tradable already on their platform. How long did this take to build? There's a lot here, but how long was it start to finish for you guys? Like two weeks, I think. Okay, yeah. Great work.
00:22:34.810 - 00:23:22.410, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really some sleepless nights. Sorry, this last weekend was a bit sleepless to say the least. And I'd ask next steps, but it sounds like you're purposefully you've got this governance token, like you're trying to deploy this thing as a platform and mainnet ethereum or mainnet polygon. We're probably going to start on polygon just because I think the cost of paying the subscription and minting the NFT and there's sort of a chain link callback thing so that you have to pay and then wait a bit for that VRF to issue you a random number and then you can mint your NFT. That'll get quite costly on ethereum. So we're probably going to launch on polygon first. Really dope build, really complex, really beautiful.
00:23:22.410 - 00:23:31.560, Speaker A: If I could give any feedback or criticism, I would say maybe you made it too complicated. Like maybe focus just on the file sharing. Maybe focus just on the NFT.
00:23:32.000 - 00:23:37.516, Speaker D: It was too easy just to show the file sharing. Like, it actually too fast. We actually had to put in I.
00:23:37.538 - 00:23:50.064, Speaker A: Blame web3 storage. It was too easy to use. Too easy. That's so good. Well, good luck with this. It's not this moment, it's the next moment when you guys go live. That's the big moment.
00:23:50.064 - 00:24:00.660, Speaker A: You guys have already built something amazing here. So this is take a victory lap and enjoy it and get ready to go live. Good job. Good job.
00:24:00.810 - 00:24:01.844, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:24:02.042 - 00:24:16.650, Speaker A: Thanks. Thank you, Team Fairy. So next up, we'll have team open labs. If you want to go ahead and share your screen, everyone. Yep, I'll go right ahead.
00:24:24.720 - 00:25:19.020, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Kwan, and today I'll be introducing Open Labs. The problem that we are looking into is the reproducibility crisis in academia, which, according to a recent poll, as much as 90% of scientists believe to be a big problem. The problem is that a lot of published results in fields such as medicine or psychology simply cannot be replicated. And this is often attributed to the lack of replication efforts within the community and a very opaque structure in how data from research are being shared around. We propose sort of like a GitHub issues for scholarly research to help mitigate this situation. Number one, we want to create a blockchain platform where all researchers can upload their project materials. The files that are uploaded are tracked by version control and can be openly reviewed by any other user.
00:25:19.020 - 00:26:23.380, Speaker C: Secondly, we also learned that reviewers are often motivated by the wish to give back and build up a reputation. We want to create a hub, a permanent record where their contribution can be publicly credited lastly, we also want to experiment with decentralized governance of the platform by allowing researchers to form their own decentralized group and vote on which projects to admit into their group. We are a team of three. I'm the lead engineer, Alexi is the front end developer, and Jackie is our webtree developer. We use three main technology for this project ceramic for version control, project files, webtree storage for the storage of the file themselves, and polygon to handle the peer review logic and to track social credits. We also have to integrate the graph for data query in chainlink for more fine tuned user authentication in the future, let's take a look at the app itself. Here we are at the homepage, and we see a list of projects from other researchers.
00:26:23.380 - 00:26:57.170, Speaker C: Let's take a look at this one. And in the middle part is a list of all the materials that the authors have uploaded. Now, it seems like this author has uploaded a survey. Let's take a quick look. Then I can write a review. Having written my review, I can then submit and then stake a portion of my social credit to back up my claims. As you can see, my review is now tracked on the blockchain.
00:26:57.170 - 00:28:04.410, Speaker C: If it is not marked as fraudulent within a fixed duration of time, then I can unstake and gain rewards for my participation. The Labs feature is also an important aspect of our platform. Let's create our own lab and start inviting other people's projects to it. After filling in the information, I can then spend ten social credits to create my own lab. As a founder, I start with a certain amount of tokens, which I can spend on other people's projects. I click on the Vouch button, select the relevant lab, and select the amount to Vouch for this project. Now that this project is affiliated with the lab, anytime that someone reviews this paper, they will also gain some tokens from the lab itself, which they can then spend to vouch on more papers or to govern the lab itself.
00:28:04.410 - 00:28:24.370, Speaker C: We foresee that Labs to become a big driving force of community engagement on our platform, as it provides researchers with a very simple way to connect with others in their niche, as well as to run a decentralized organization and directly influence the future direction of their field.
00:28:29.850 - 00:28:48.250, Speaker A: All right, three minutes for Q and A starts. Now. I like the use of the 1155. That's a cool way to do that. Like the Vouch system with an 1155. It makes sense to do that. I'm just digging into the code yet I don't have a specific question yet.
00:28:48.250 - 00:29:31.740, Speaker A: Maybe I'll yield to Morgan and then come back. Yeah, sure. I just want to say I think that the game for a lot of science and psychology is really changing. I think that doing this type of labs as a service protocol is like a really cool way. It's almost like the social credit system, creating more trust and get resources to the right data center. It seems like this sort of cross tokenization can sort of create this like, Dow as a service with these labs. I'm wondering if you thought about something related to specific use cases with institutions or are you thinking more about myself, which is like an independent researcher? Where do you see your focus fitting in?
00:29:32.110 - 00:30:09.046, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. We are looking at this lab as sort of a Dow. We are thinking that it's more decentralized and more like democratic in a way that let's say you are someone who is very passionate about cancer research. Then you can start this own lab. And it sort of acts like an accelerator of sort, where you can start helping to curate projects that you think are interesting. You vouch for them, and then those people of those projects start earning those tokens and they become part of the community, and they can vote for more people to join the lab. And our core concern is actually around the issue of peer review.
00:30:09.046 - 00:30:33.520, Speaker C: And there's not that strong of an incentive for very busy researchers to be looking at each other's paper. But what if we tie that to this idea of reputation and building community and that's what these labs as a Dow kind of incentivize. They will start reviewing each other and then gain social credits and then build this reciprocal relationship with one another.
00:30:37.490 - 00:30:59.880, Speaker A: I feel like one of the hardest things is actually getting people to use it right. I love that you're trying to align incentives and trying to set something up where people can use it. Kind of like two paths here. Let's say this gets adoption and people use it. How do you get that adoption? And then if you don't get that adoption, what's next for you within ethereum if this doesn't hit?
00:31:00.410 - 00:31:41.678, Speaker C: Absolutely. So you want the adoption to be very organic and be geared around the way academia work. I personally am an undergraduate researcher, so I know there's a lot of actual labs with professors, PhD, postdocs and that kind of stuff. And so one way we could see adoption being incentivized is kind of like within the lab, professors encourage the students to use this to start gathering feedback for their results. And also for especially people in soft sciences where credibility is a big issue, you want to be able to stand up from your competitor. So imagine if you could write in your paper that, oh yeah, all this code and scripts has been reviewed by the Open Society on Open Labs.
00:31:41.854 - 00:31:46.870, Speaker A: So you need to find a professor or someone on the ground and get this in their hands and get them using it.
00:31:47.020 - 00:31:47.720, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:31:49.210 - 00:31:54.086, Speaker A: Like this. Great. Good hackathon project.
00:31:54.268 - 00:31:55.510, Speaker C: Yeah. Appreciate it.
00:31:55.580 - 00:32:02.170, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Team open labs. Now we'll go on to Team MetaBank.
00:32:05.630 - 00:32:14.380, Speaker E: So let me just share my screen. Can you see my screen now?
00:32:14.830 - 00:32:15.922, Speaker A: Yep, yep.
00:32:16.006 - 00:32:41.698, Speaker E: So I'm just going to start playing. Hi, I'm Lowell. And together with George and Frank, our team MetaBank. There are 1.7 billion adults who lack bank accounts, and one of the major reasons is because traditional banks require a multitude of factors, such as steady income history, maintenance fees, and credit ratings. In the Metaverse, such problems do not exist. In fact, there is even an opportunity to create a banking system that is advantageous in a global scale.
00:32:41.698 - 00:33:07.786, Speaker E: Such advantage include the opportunity to borrow money with lesser requirements compared with traditional banks. This is where MetaBank comes in. MetaBank makes it easier to access high yield savings account and under collateralized loans that serve as digital credit cards, all within the confines of a Metaverse. They can even purchase an NFT through various platforms. We use IPFS Ave and polygon. And for the product presentation, here is George.
00:33:07.898 - 00:33:49.440, Speaker A: Okay, so to get started, you want to log in with MetaMask should be connected. If you haven't already, join as a member to the bank. Otherwise you can't deposit or withdraw your savings or get a credit card and whatnot. So once that's done, now you're a member. You could deposit into your savings. You have your credit. You don't have any right now, but you can get one once you deposit savings and you have the pool of overall amount, interest garnered and also the number of members.
00:33:49.440 - 00:34:23.830, Speaker A: So now let's deposit into our savings. You could only deposit die. So if you don't have any already, then deposit some die. Swap some ETH into die. So we'll just do one ETH. All right, now that you have the your now that you have your die, you want to deposit your die. So we'll do 2000 die.
00:34:23.830 - 00:35:13.100, Speaker A: You want to approve that, and then you want to deposit the die in there. So now you have 2000 die in the contract confirmed, also in your dashboard. Now look at your dashboard. You got 2000 die, and because you have some savings in your account, now you could make a credit card. So to make a credit card is pretty easy. As long as you have some money deposited in your savings, you generate a credit limit. So I have a credit limit of almost $500.
00:35:13.100 - 00:36:15.970, Speaker A: If I'm satisfied with that, then I just get my credit card. Okay, so now you have your credit contract, and all you need to do is activate your so called digital credit card. So now you have credit available that you could use to spend on anything, just like a regular credit card. And then you have the option to always repay that credit whenever you need to, but it has to be in USDC. And that's it. Go back to the dashboard. You can see the whole summary of your and you can see the whole summary of your account, savings, credit, and the entire pool.
00:36:15.970 - 00:36:17.040, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:36:21.730 - 00:36:24.320, Speaker E: So, yeah, we're now open for questions.
00:36:25.170 - 00:37:18.080, Speaker A: If you want to sell online. Yeah, I had an initial question here. I know that Aave kind of have some intricacies with their contracts, and so it's great to see what you've got going on with there. I love to see the fact that credit people can pool their resources together. Have you considered things related to reputation or how you might involve whether the credit worthiness of an individual or groups together in some dynamic, whether it's through culture or other mechanisms like reputation or identity? Yeah, I can take that. So ideally, we would want to add in verifiable credentials. So whether that be like, hyperledger aries, we looked into ceramic with the IDX or some other digital identity where you could validate yourself.
00:37:18.080 - 00:38:11.346, Speaker A: As of right now, since we don't have anyone technically verified, it's just your wallet. It's just pegged to 101 at most. So depending on the amount of savings you have, you could only borrow up to that amount. Otherwise, once you have verified credentials, then it could be like we have it where you could do up to three X borrowed amount, so you could actually have an under collateralized credit. And then it just works essentially just like a credit card. And how does it map in if other people in the pool? Your connection is a little choppy. I'm not sure.
00:38:11.346 - 00:38:22.434, Speaker A: My Internet was I think it might be Morgan's. Yeah, it's the hummingbirds. They're fluttering around, messing up your Wi Fi here. It's the frequencies. Yeah. Awesome. You can go ahead with the question.
00:38:22.434 - 00:38:38.578, Speaker A: I don't want to take up you guys. I went to go check out your code and the link is broken. I don't know. I'll paste it in here. Maybe it's someone else's. I have it on private, if you guys wouldn't mind. Yeah, I'll make it public.
00:38:38.578 - 00:39:30.314, Speaker A: And my question would be, like, did you guys have to write any custom smart contracts for this, or is it basically just piggybacked on Aave and polygon? It's mainly just on top of Aave, which is dope. Which is dope. That's just the essentially yeah. Essentially, when you ask for credit, you actually deploy your own contract that you have complete control over as the user. So trying to organize that where your credit contract interacts with the savings pool, it was a little complicated in terms of trying to make that interact at first, but we were able to figure that out. So, yeah, it was not too much customization. It was just more of how we organized the code.
00:39:30.314 - 00:39:56.430, Speaker A: Okay. To make sure I understood that. So paste your link into your contract if you guys have it, but you guys do deploy a custom contract, and it basically acts kind of like a smart contract wallet where it's the identity and it's taking out the credit line. Okay, cool. So the custom contract thing was just a question. I think that some of the best apps that we see are going to be built on top of these services. That already exist.
00:39:56.430 - 00:40:32.830, Speaker A: And yeah, sometimes you'll need a smart contract for and what's cool is if you have that smart contract there, you can do things like gasless transactions and some more magical things where that is the identity. And you can just be signing messages and relay them in. Cool build. I liked your design, too. What do you guys use for your front end? How'd you guys create that? We used Next JS and then a lot of it was custom CSS. Yeah, it's a nice clean design. Thank you.
00:40:32.830 - 00:40:46.420, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay. Thank you for that. MetaBank. Next up we have team Sid Sign. Sorry if I messed up the name, but you can correct me if I'm wrong. Good.
00:40:46.420 - 00:41:09.370, Speaker A: All right, please share your screen and start your presentation. Welcome to the presentation for Sid Sign. SIDS with domain names. This is a Hack FS 2021 submission. My name is Nick West. James GitHub handle at Nick Westcham. This is me official, wildly hacky code and give fun presentations.
00:41:09.370 - 00:41:46.550, Speaker A: The problem is lack of easily verifiable and permanent way to sign documents without modifying them. Think of a school transcript. These are hard to sign. Typically, there's a team working at different academic institutions who send out hard copies or respond to queries. Typically, these hard copies are signed with a physical stamp. Unofficial transcripts are sent out in PDF format, which are unsigned. So think how could the schools more easily permanently sign these documents in an open way? How could you save on employee time responding to these requests? Employee time both for the institution and for the employers.
00:41:46.550 - 00:42:20.734, Speaker A: Existing solutions difficult to use. Typically, they work within a corporate intranet and they require high barriers to entry. PKI infrastructure is not user friendly, and they often require modification to the underlying base. File solution is what who uploaded that document? This allows SIDS to be signed by domain name owners, and this signature should be easily verified by anyone. It has file uploading with Web Three storage. Sid signed using Ethereum blockchain and using TXT domain name records to verify ownership of Ethereum addresses. Let's go to a quick demo to our page thinkingsoo.com
00:42:20.734 - 00:42:51.066, Speaker A: we need MetaMask right now for this. We're going to select a file test TXT. This could be any file, any transcript. What this does this uploads it, it gets the CID and queries our smart contract for that CID. This is using the injected Web group provider, but could be used for something like Infuria. Also, if you don't have injected Web group provider, we can see the different Ethereum accounts that have signed this Sid in our smart contract. What dates and what link domain names to sign this document? It's very easy.
00:42:51.066 - 00:43:14.210, Speaker A: Give it inject web Three provider, click Sign. It's going to pop up a MetaMask type solution and we're just going to sign it, no problem. So we'll give that a SEC, see if this has worked. 1 second here. Okay. Right now we can see. We're waiting for it.
00:43:14.210 - 00:43:33.320, Speaker A: Send. Okay, it's been sent. We can see. This is our current time and a most recent update here for these linked domains. What happens is we look at the domain TXT records so we can see Westjam.com here TXT record. We've got an address stating ownership on this Ethereum address.
00:43:33.320 - 00:43:50.574, Speaker A: So got an API endpoint. You can add domains to this and it will search the domain records for that Ethereum address. So let's say I want to add Westjam.com to this. Real simple. This has been added. I go back to our what it page, refresh it.
00:43:50.574 - 00:44:23.026, Speaker A: We can see the Ethereum address ownership has been updated. So, very simple. There's also an easy browser extension here. This is a hack FS page. I can see some Ethereum addresses on here. So I've got an extension here which will just check any addresses on the page and just verify the ownership, if that exists in our system. So the stack, stack and gone through front end, most prizes, back end, Django, rest frame requests, some Solidity and some CSS for the browser extension.
00:44:23.026 - 00:44:51.650, Speaker A: Lots of limitations. Edge cases not really captured. Security needs to be delve into deeper, but this just kind of shows what it could be. This is all live demo, all working as you've seen it, and GitHub page is up. In conclusion, this is a way to permanently sign a document without modifying the base file. It's fully open and it links domains to Ethereum addresses, enabling easy understanding of who signed to sit. More work to be done, but definitely see some space, some opportunity in the academic space.
00:44:51.650 - 00:45:27.206, Speaker A: Thanks for your time. Okay, now we'll move on to the three minutes for Q A. I'm not seeing the GitHub repo there. Well, I clicked through to your GitHub repo and I just see a README and a license. Am I looking at the wrong repo? I think the wrong repo if you go to Nick Westjam as the user and then the repo Sid sign, yeah, I was able to pull it up. I just posted in the chat. Really great work tying all these different technologies.
00:45:27.206 - 00:46:16.714, Speaker A: It's cool to see the signatures with the normal DNS and doing that stored in a decentralized way. I'm curious to know whether or not you thought about specific use cases or people that might be using it other than just the broad term of institutions or seems like it's kind of like a mix between these decentralized and centralized kind of parties here. Where do you see the first user? Yeah, I really see it, actually. As for academic universities, I'm thinking like, my brother just got his transcripts mailed off, but it cost him $20 Canadian to send them to each institution. He had to send them to at least nine different locations. So a couple of just see that so easily being done as like a PDF that can be digitally signed for your transcripts. Also, another easy one would be like if maybe that's a little more formal.
00:46:16.714 - 00:46:51.334, Speaker A: If you have an online course and you want a more official certificate, I could see that as an easy use case also. Awesome. Yeah. The credential of domain names and institutions I think is really interesting. Have you thought about ENS as well in the future? I haven't dug too deep into that. I wanted to use really the existing one because I wanted to make it so almost like the opposite of not being anonymous. I want to make it very tying into traditional identities of who.
00:46:51.334 - 00:46:58.454, Speaker A: This is cool. Yeah. I really like the practicality. Great job. Great work on the tactical side, too. Thanks. Yeah.
00:46:58.454 - 00:47:24.270, Speaker A: Speaking of practicality, you get extra points when there's like a live demo that I can get into and click into and log in, and you guys did that. It's not pretty, but it's live and it works. And that's how hackathon projects need to. So good job. Good hackathon project. Like Morgan said, you guys brought a lot of stuff together, I noticed. Even like a Chrome extension, you needed the Chrome extension to do the signatures or what was the Chrome extension? Why did you need that? I didn't need it.
00:47:24.270 - 00:47:43.910, Speaker A: I just could do it. And I was like, 20 lines of code, the most hacking Chrome extension ever. I was like, I'll throw it in there. Why not? Good hackathon project. Nice work, guys. You're going to overtake MetaMask in the institution. Cool, thanks.
00:47:43.910 - 00:47:48.550, Speaker A: Okay, if you guys are done, we'll move on to Team Dai.
00:48:05.340 - 00:48:56.098, Speaker E: A minute. Just sharing everyone myself. From Team De AI. And in our hackathon project, we have tried to combine two big technologies of the present world known as machine learning and blockchain. So now I'm going to tell you what our project is really about. So data privacy is a big concern. People want good recommendations engines, but they don't want to give their data.
00:48:56.098 - 00:50:12.250, Speaker E: Also, getting data for making medical machine learning models is a very big deal as patient data need to be kept private and very less medical data is available on the web. So Deai solved this problem by giving an architecture where you provide your data to train machine learning models, but nobody owns your data, nor your data is exposed to anywhere. Only a hash of your data is stored in our data handler. We have used Web three storage as our data handler here. This hash is Irreversible and is used to keep in check that the data that we are providing to our training model is not duplicate. And nobody is just spamming same data. So now as we have moved inside our app, so now we have deployed a basic machine learning model, which is the sentiment analysis model, and we'll be demonstrating this model sentiment analysis model.
00:50:12.250 - 00:50:57.638, Speaker E: So as we see the bottom section, this is the train module. So anyone who is willing to provide data to train our model can write their data here and press Train. The given data shows that the given comment is a positive comment which is being provided to the Smart Contract for training our model. So when you press Train, it asks for to take some ethereum. This is to make sure that the data provided is good. So whenever the model's accuracy is increased, the model is updated and is pushed to the Web Three storage. This model then can be used for getting predictions.
00:50:57.638 - 00:51:30.320, Speaker E: Any user who wants to get predictions has to buy subscription. We have used unlocked protocol for buying subscriptions here. So now we'll be demonstrating the getting predictions. When Get prediction will be pressed, it will show a toast below that shows the subscription has been purchased. Here it is. So, as it shows, this is a positive review. Positive review.
00:51:30.320 - 00:51:53.500, Speaker E: So this output has been given from our trained model that has been trained on the Smart Contract using users data. And the data is not revealed or exposed anywhere. So that was all about our project. Thank you and have a nice day. See you around. The Web Three space.
00:51:56.590 - 00:52:18.018, Speaker A: Combining ML and something that's expensive to process and store. With Blockchain, where it's like you can't kind of run that stuff and store that stuff. It's always an interesting way to mix those things and see how people figure out how to do that. So, good work. Cool project. It's a fun hackathon project. Yes.
00:52:18.104 - 00:52:48.380, Speaker E: Actually, last summer, like this June or July, we were really working on a research project that included some medical data and we lagged that medical data earlier. It's kept private for a patient's privacy. So we have actually failed this. So we needed a solution and Blockchain was the only solution. And in this hackathon, we found really cool tools to build this project and went for it.
00:52:53.010 - 00:53:15.460, Speaker A: Yeah, really cool. I love the fact that different medical institutions or different places can have different options with how they're processing their data. I'm curious to know the tech stack with where you're storing it, is it just through you mentioned Web Three, but I'm wondering if also the model gets stored as well and tracked because I'd like to see some type of yeah, go ahead.
00:53:16.310 - 00:54:07.170, Speaker E: Actually, first of all, we were training the model on the Smart Contract as well as storing it on the Smart Contract also, but that included a fee and Web Three storage. Such a great storage tool that reduces the cost of storing our data. That model that can be used by any application that just needs to use that data, that data model to get predictions. Like if any hospital wants to train their corona detection model, then it can just build and can access that Web Three storage model only. It does not need to be connected to the Smart Contracts.
00:54:07.330 - 00:54:08.040, Speaker A: Okay.
00:54:08.730 - 00:54:11.960, Speaker E: That segment can be built separately also.
00:54:12.490 - 00:54:55.960, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, I'd love to see more development with the ability to choose different biases from models and the ability for a doctor to become almost a pseudoscientist with AI as well as this augmented tool. Really cool. I had to dig into the contracts and look, and sure enough, you're normalizing weights, you're finding the prediction and you're in a for loop, looking through the weights and adding them together. So I can't believe you put this all into solidity. But it's really cool how you're classifying and you're actually bringing this data in and you're running it through the EVM. So again, super neat hackathon project, being able to bring ML data and solidity and smart contracts together.
00:54:56.490 - 00:54:59.800, Speaker E: Yes, sleepless nights. That's what it's called.
00:55:02.730 - 00:55:07.754, Speaker A: Good work. Keep hacking. I want to see you around the Ethereum space course.
00:55:07.792 - 00:55:09.260, Speaker E: Of course. Thank you.
00:55:11.470 - 00:55:50.350, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you, Team Tai. Next we'll move on to team weather timeline. Hello. I don't think you're sharing audio. If the video is playing sound, we can't hear it yet. It should be a setting for screen share.
00:55:50.350 - 00:57:33.820, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Christian Monk. I am a participant in Hack FS and I have made idea Weber timeline. That it's only an idea I haven't coached yet, I haven't made a prototype, but I have done just research Google about weather and this idea for the tree there to make it back plane pixels. And here I share some power. Like today it's all night. If you ask do it impact my day very long. Then use weather time to that.
00:57:33.820 - 00:59:22.650, Speaker A: We have to use web two CM. We can exempt using weather data in our open source process or the weather from EMI. Here's some of the domains, options and ink to set up and make development image from Windows and it in virtual code in OTML, CSS and aerospace. The weather highline. I like to use weather data. It can be open source, get rid of open source depths or other services. I like to use open data from users and share content.
00:59:22.650 - 01:00:41.810, Speaker A: Hey, good hackathon project. It was in the white paper and Vitalik wrote about how we would have weather and insurance together and how Oracles would do this. And we still don't see this built. So are you going to continue building this? Yes. I have contact with another hacker from this hackathon who is DevOps and solidity. So we hope to make the back end for something with a weather timeline for developers and big firms. Is the idea because there are not any open data yet? Not enough open data on the web to get used to copy or save on EPFS or something.
01:00:41.810 - 01:01:45.780, Speaker A: Pleak and Slate are something I think of. Another one I'll share is Google Weather from Chainlink. They do an Oracle service and I'll share it in the chat. And you can share that with your developer too? Yes. So had to learn to program and had to learn all this blockchain and you can't even I had been with you since last tagata, so it's evolved. And Maya Day, I haven't found any weather data or weather apps or depths onto this. So I think my idea for an end user is unique.
01:01:45.780 - 01:02:59.796, Speaker A: Yeah, like Austin mentioned, I think that there are some open weather sourcing, but it'd be cool to tie in more developers into decentralized hardware that might look at other sourcing that you might be able to run nodes on, like IPFS or something like that, where it goes direct to source. That might be an interesting hack as well. I love the idea of hardware out in the field too, but gathering rain and reporting on how much rain it picked up, that's another interesting angle. Yes, the open data. The DMI in Denmark, weather Service working for a new open data and all weather from service from National International Time work for Open Data at Weather. Well, keep hacking, keep building. I want to see it get built.
01:02:59.796 - 01:03:33.270, Speaker A: Yeah, Christian, I think seeing your project from last time and this hack effect, it's great. So hopefully we get to see the first ever weather DAP from you free online. Thank you so much. Thank you. Team weather timeline. And we'll be moving on to Team Crypto des NFT But following their presentation, we will have a ten minute break. Hi everybody.
01:03:38.790 - 01:04:13.190, Speaker F: Starting to share my screen here. Hi, my name is Rory and this is my project submission for Hack FS 2021. The name of my project is Crypto Devs and is an NFT for aspiring crypto developers. I came into this hackathon looking to hack solo so that I could gauge where my skill set was from brainstorming all the way through to coding. And this is what I came up with. So I will do a short demo.
01:04:19.030 - 01:04:19.442, Speaker A: First.
01:04:19.496 - 01:05:14.660, Speaker F: I developed the contracts and did all the testing in Hard Hat, and first thing I'm going to do is show you the Hard hat tests and that they are all passing. Second thing I'm going to do is I've set up a local Hard hat node already and it's running. So I'm going to go ahead and deploy the contract to the local host. Now that we've done that, I'm going to go ahead and show you the front end here. And first thing, it wants to let me to log into MetaMask or our favorite wallet here. We're going to go ahead and do that and that shows that our wallet is connected and we're going to go ahead and fill out our portfolio information before we send it, before we mint it as an NFT. First we choose our image, then our name.
01:05:14.660 - 01:05:51.342, Speaker F: And I went ahead and pre wrote this and I'm going to copy paste it so that this demo goes by a little bit quicker. But this is just a brief summary. This will actually appear on OpenSea in the description field and we're going to go ahead and select some of our skills here. Solidity hard hat node. Since this is my first react project, we're not going to select that. Ethers JS has been a great help during this project, so we're going to select that. We also have the Looking for Web Three development job checkbox here.
01:05:51.342 - 01:06:43.050, Speaker F: And you can turn that on or off, depending on what your situation is. And next we're going to go ahead and copy our project details here. And what this is, is this stores on IPFS a markdown file which you can use to showcase your projects. We're going to go ahead and paste that, and we're going to click the Mint new NFT button here. While that's working, what's going to happen is in the background, it's using the Web Three storage API, and it's sending that image there, getting a CID for it, and then changing the source of the HTML to look for that proper image there. Pretty soon here it will be asking me to confirm a transaction. Lately, my MetaMask has been a little slow on my local host.
01:06:43.050 - 01:07:26.542, Speaker F: But what I have done is I have deployed this to the Rinkabee testnet already. And the great thing about this here is that you're able to display all your NFTs. Currently, right now, there's only one Minted. These NFTs are non transferable and there's only one allowed per address. But I think it's really nice that you can be able to integrate into Openc like this. And obviously, I use the Web Three storage API to build the metadata file and then submit it and get the CID and mint the token with that. As you see here, there's our description here that we filled in, and then the properties are here as well.
01:07:26.542 - 01:07:42.322, Speaker F: The web3 job status you can see is looking ethers JS hard hat So our skills are highlighted here, and that's how it appears on Openc. All right, thank you for watching my demo.
01:07:42.376 - 01:08:12.966, Speaker A: I appreciate it. Thank you for the presentation. We'll be moving on to the three minute Q A now. So it's an NFT that represents a developer's abilities. And then as you were building it, you're kind of like registering your own abilities as you went through it. This is a very meta but very good hackathon project. I want my question to be more meta in terms of how can we do better as a space to onboard.
01:08:12.966 - 01:08:17.150, Speaker A: What was maybe the hardest part for you in terms of getting this built and getting it shipped?
01:08:17.970 - 01:09:03.322, Speaker F: Honestly, the hardest part was the brainstorming. And okay, I came into this looking at all the sponsors. I'm really new to the Web Three space, so I was trying to absorb all the sponsors and the seminars and all that, and just there's so much available and there's so much interesting to look at. To me, it was about narrowing down what I could look at, what I could absorb, because it was just too much. I was trying to absorb and put so many things in that I think I got just a little bit distracted. So the brainstorming was tough. There were so many things that I wanted to do, but I just felt like I needed to kind of pick one and narrow it down.
01:09:03.322 - 01:09:30.580, Speaker F: And there's so many things and so many of these projects that are in this hackathon are amazing. And there's so many things to look at and so many things to really deep dive into. But what I wanted to make sure is that I had a development process so I had to cut short a lot of the exploring and expanding what else was available to kind of narrow down and get a project done.
01:09:31.830 - 01:09:57.086, Speaker A: At first I was going to say was there the inspiration available? It sounds like the tooling was good and the inspiration was there and you had a bunch of examples, it was just kind of synthesizing it down to what are my abilities to apply this tooling to one of these ideas and what can I get done? So it sounds like you had the inspiration and you had the tooling, it was just about narrowing it down and attacking it, is that right?
01:09:57.188 - 01:10:00.480, Speaker F: Yeah, that's absolutely it cool.
01:10:02.610 - 01:10:17.362, Speaker A: Maybe as an ecosystem we could provide a little bit better tech tree where it's like you get this ability and then it upgrades to this ability and this ability and you start with NFTs but then you get to a Dex eventually or something like that just as a metacomment cool hackathon project.
01:10:17.496 - 01:10:19.730, Speaker F: Thank you very much, I appreciate your comment.
01:10:20.150 - 01:10:47.390, Speaker A: Yeah, I really love the ideas. There the extra add ons and really cool to see the sort of non transport side. I know that with NFTs sort of just as an identifier it can be sort of weighty but when you have sort of like this ENS type thing that represents not just a name but also extra add ons with skills and whatnot can be really cool and a lot of use cases. Have you considered looking at Gnosis now or incorporating with other types of social networks?
01:10:49.250 - 01:11:37.120, Speaker F: I haven't at this point. Really what I wanted to do was just absorb myself and get a project and I definitely had to pivot on a couple of my ideas through the project just because I didn't really know what was available. But I think the most exciting thing is that I was able to get this all done in the browser and I didn't have to post anything, which to me I come from PHP and older. To me when I came into this I just assumed that I needed to have a server running and post it to there and working with the web, three API, learning, react and getting it all to work in the browser was really impressive to me and it really was something that was like an eye opening moment. Like wow, we can do this totally different way.
01:11:38.770 - 01:11:59.218, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Love to see more of it. I wanted to dive into your contract real quick to see how you disabled token transfer. And it looks like you hooked into the before token transfer. And then you just require that the address is zero, which would make it impossible possible. Cool.
01:11:59.218 - 01:12:00.610, Speaker A: Interesting way to do that.
01:12:00.680 - 01:12:05.942, Speaker F: I wrote test cases and it passed all my test cases. So that was good enough for me.
01:12:06.076 - 01:12:14.418, Speaker A: That's another thing to give props to is you led with the test cases. You said here's the first and here are the test cases. Thanks.
01:12:14.604 - 01:12:19.770, Speaker F: That's how I did try and develop. It was test first and make that work.
01:12:19.920 - 01:12:23.194, Speaker A: Keep hacking and building on Ethereum. I want to see you at the next one.
01:12:23.312 - 01:12:26.480, Speaker F: Excellent. Thank you very much for your comments, guys. Appreciate it.
01:12:27.330 - 01:26:03.660, Speaker A: Thank you. Team crypto does NFT we'll be taking our ten minute break now, but after the break, we'll have Team D chan. All right, we're going to get started again. Our break is over. So the next team going will be Team D chan. We'll wait for everybody to come back though. As a quick note, Austin is a there we go.
01:26:03.660 - 01:27:17.338, Speaker A: All right, if we're all ready then Team D Chen, you are good to go. Hey guys, what's up? Okay, let me just share my screen. So hey guys, I'm representing Vicha decentralized Memes and blogging. The reason behind this hack was because people sometimes feel scary to be who they are. And in normal platforms, normal platforms don't help people express their opinions because you have your login, you have your profile, people know you and if you say something wrong, they're just going to bully you. They're just going to talk shit about you and they're going to come after you. I don't think that's human at all because there's one secret about being human is that talking and listening come together.
01:27:17.338 - 01:27:48.158, Speaker A: You got to respect that. So on the channel, you can post your memes, transform them into NFTs and monetize on your ideas and topics. So let's go to demo. So local host, right, we're here. So first things first, you can actually create your login. So cute Pikachu. And we can get an image here from Cute Pikachu.
01:27:48.158 - 01:28:07.142, Speaker A: And this is created on ceramics. So I already have a login. You get the image picture the image login. Okay. And you just set your profile. So I'm just going to read my profile from my wallet. And my name is Obisan.
01:28:07.142 - 01:28:27.682, Speaker A: So I created the Obisan. And here it is. It's a picture. It's a picture of Obi Wan. If I actually open it up, it goes to the image link. Yay. Well, of course I know he's me if I ping 127001.
01:28:27.682 - 01:28:47.814, Speaker A: Okay, so let's have some fun here in D chan. So I'm going to post a picture. I came into Mecca because I love Meccas, so Gundams will be real. You have to believe me. So I'm just going to. Create this simple meme here. You have to believe me.
01:28:47.814 - 01:29:07.002, Speaker A: And I'm going to sell it for a 0.3 matic prize. And I'm pretty sure I have a Gundam picture with me. Where are you? Here you are. Gundam. JPEG. So this is going to go to IPFS, okay? It's connected to inferior.
01:29:07.002 - 01:29:48.986, Speaker A: So when I create this post, it's going to be sent there and there's going to be a pricing list for the platform so it can maintain itself, and later we can withdraw. And if you don't love me at my, then you don't deserve me at my best. So Gundams will be real. Let's just test it out. I'm going to buy this and it's going to show up in my collection. So you can collect your memes and collect your topics from people posting on these different topics. And I really like this project, and I just want to pump it up here.
01:29:48.986 - 01:30:19.122, Speaker A: I just want to create many topics. I don't know, maybe have two lines of navigation. And I also want to hack in some cool chatting and posting chitchat kind of components. And I'm really in love with this project. And that was Dichon. Yeah, guys, that was my demo. I like the topics across the top.
01:30:19.122 - 01:30:37.322, Speaker A: That design with the color scheme, with the topics. I think that's probably my favorite part. So just to zoom in, it's cool. It looks like you made a post and then you're able to sell the post. Is that a single one? Is it fractionalized? Is it an ERC, 721. It is an 1155. Sorry.
01:30:37.322 - 01:31:03.474, Speaker A: Well, it's not 1155. It's an NFT. It's 721. So when you post a topic, you can actually just put the price in the very high price and people will never buy your post. But you want to just permanently put it there. I don't know. I got some info from the Pentagon and you put the price up and it just stays there on topic and people won't ever buy that.
01:31:03.474 - 01:31:28.774, Speaker A: Or maybe the Pentagon will actually have to buy that to hide up the information. So, yeah, it's 721. I'm using concat to reverse. So every time it posts, it's always the newest post that's going to be showing up. And the last post is going to be post number one. Another thing that I want to pull into the contract is actually the token number. So maybe dubs and trips and quads will exist on blockchain.
01:31:28.774 - 01:31:55.122, Speaker A: That's going to be awesome. So that's going to overprice the price because, oh, it's the first quads ever or the first dubs ever on Dchan. And I think that's actually a pretty cool idea. I'm going to pull that up too. Yeah, the color scheme took me like forever. I had to red one and read 500 and just start pulling it up. What are all these? Okay, there's like a ton of contracts in here, but I think they're all just 720 ones.
01:31:55.122 - 01:32:26.766, Speaker A: Is that right? Or most variations. Yeah, they're basically the same contracts. I just changed the typing on them and the market and where they're pointing into. So that actually every time we can actually have different number of posts. If you enter into Fortune or another chant, you can go to a topic and there's over 333,000,000 posts on politicians. But if you go to Mecca, there's only like 200,000 posts. But that's the cool part about it.
01:32:26.766 - 01:33:11.098, Speaker A: It's not that it's just one NFT contract, but there's various NFC contracts bringing into different numbers of tokens. Yeah, I also like the design at the top. It almost looks like a spectrum of information flow going to this decentralized chan memetic culture that you're trying to create here. Curious to know that the tech stack, how are you posting it? Is it using Web three storage or is it done ceramic? Well, the ceramic is just for profile. You can actually post without making your profile. It's just one extra flavor that I put into it. But in the future, I'm only going to make posts if you have your ceramic set up.
01:33:11.098 - 01:34:07.546, Speaker A: So it was kind of hard to actually make it all functional because there are over 73 contracts working there. Can you redo your question? Somebody's calling me? I just lost myself. Sorry. Master Morgan, could you redo your question? Yeah, no, just curious about the tech stack and also the aspect of moderation as well. Okay, so tech stack, I use basically Next JS and I use Link to link all of the also for the use I didn't post this one on the GitHub, but I'm using AWS to actually start making posts. And also I'm using Master Ryan's discordion. But to actually do that, to actually use SSLL and Filecoin to make a decentralized full chat thing, I'll need to actually have the entire domain.
01:34:07.546 - 01:34:16.900, Speaker A: So I would have to buy Dchungx.com and all of the SSL to make this special.
01:34:18.870 - 01:34:20.062, Speaker G: Href.
01:34:20.126 - 01:34:51.450, Speaker A: I think that's the link to these chitchats. I think. What else can I say about the back end of it? Yeah, it's basically next JS and I'm using hard hats and I'm using yeah, I think that's that and react and next. Cool. Yeah, interesting concept. Thanks a lot, Master Morgan. Good hackathon project.
01:34:51.450 - 01:35:00.890, Speaker A: Keep building. I want to see it. I'm going to conclude this one. This one's awesome. Take care, Austin. Bye bye. Thank you, Team Dichon.
01:35:00.890 - 01:35:42.290, Speaker A: And now we'll be moving on to Team Discovery, which should be our last team of the session. Hi, so hello everyone. We will do a short intro before starting the video. Before diving into the demo, focused on the technical and functional aspects, we would like to present our project in simpler terms. Discovery, educates and onboards users and developers into the future of the web. How do we do this? By providing qualitative courses with reliable information that can be proposed, validated and updated by the community. And I'll share my screen.
01:35:48.920 - 01:35:53.824, Speaker B: Discovery is a gamified learning platform where members of the official Web Three protocol.
01:35:53.872 - 01:36:23.376, Speaker A: Teams collaborate with yeah, I don't think you're sharing the audio content creation. I'm sorry for that. I checked in the box it is, but it's just really quiet. It's there. All right, if anyone else in the team can let me see just crank it up as much as you can and hit go. We can deal with it. We'll turn it up.
01:36:23.376 - 01:36:40.310, Speaker A: It is max volume right now, so I am freaking, I'll reshare and hopefully it will be better.
01:36:56.520 - 01:37:14.930, Speaker B: Discovery is a game learning platform where members of the official Web Three protocol teams collaborate with community experts in various fields such as content creation and research, development or security to create high quality courses that are built around open source trustable and verifiable content.
01:37:16.420 - 01:37:27.940, Speaker G: The first step for users will be to log in with their Metamass wallet or other Web Three wallet through the Polygon network. When you first log in you will need to sign a ceramic string.
01:37:29.960 - 01:37:30.324, Speaker A: And.
01:37:30.362 - 01:38:27.060, Speaker B: Here we do that and once we get logged in it will go ahead and take us to the Starter profile page. It does take a couple of seconds to create the new user did. All right, and here we are on our projects path and we're going to go ahead and start with the Polygon path and we're going to go with the best DeFi projects on Polygon and let's open up our quest and once these questions are answered we'll be able to mint our NFT. So yes, there is Polygon or Aave available on the old Matic network and the testnet is called Mumbai. So we'll submit these.
01:38:34.850 - 01:39:48.070, Speaker G: It is at this point that we will use Chainlink to verify that the user has completed the quest successfully and that they are attempting to claim the reward for. Chainlink will check the ceramic stream and verify that the user's did will match the record completing the quest related to the reward that they are trying to claim and only then will the user be allowed to mint their NFT. This will actually directly be stored on NFT storage. In addition to creating our own lessons in quest in house, we also plan on making our entire platform completely modular. We focus on this by creating and providing a template and working with the official protocol team so that they are able to create courses and challenges for the things they would like to see their protocol used for. With this, protocols will not only be able to suggest and work with the Discovery team to create content, but they will be able to actually create their own content as well as offer their own rewards in conjunction with the standard Discovery NFT rewards.
01:39:48.650 - 01:40:28.450, Speaker B: And because we are emphasizing modularity, we're also using GitBook to create content like many other protocols. So we've created a plug and play GitHub action that can be used in any repo GitBook or code of the repo will be uploaded to IPFS through Web three storage. We then generate an NFT that contains metadata such as the CIDs of the files of the repo, the name of the authors, the ID, the GitHub commit ID, et cetera. We then upload that NFT to NFT storage and create a ceramic document.
01:40:30.230 - 01:40:30.546, Speaker A: That.
01:40:30.568 - 01:40:34.050, Speaker B: Contains the CID returned by NFT storage.
01:40:39.130 - 01:41:21.490, Speaker A: All right, we'll move on to the Q A. You have three minutes. I really love the concept of education here where people are sort of passed through these paths of education and learning and tooling. So really kudos to that. And sort of the question and answering concept can kind of even like you can even possibly incorporate it into some type of AI or something like that. But I'd be curious to know how you plan to incorporate new types of tooling into the pathways that you might be involved in. Could you specify what you mean by new types of tooling? Like, for example, AI.
01:41:21.490 - 01:41:58.880, Speaker A: Well, not necessarily AI, but I guess involving you mentioned like polygon learning, these certain sort of almost like micro credentials minted as NFTs, how easy it is for other people to incorporate that or add on other tooling sets in the decentralized ecosystem. I see. So the one that will pass the quest will receive an NFT and he can use that NFT anywhere. So I guess I'm not sure if that answers your question.
01:41:59.730 - 01:42:44.190, Speaker G: I think what he might be getting at, and I could be wrong, is what we've got it set up as is. If somebody wants to add on to the polygon quest, they would go to the Getbook page and they would try to push this new let's say they wanted to add a couple new little mini courses or mini modules. They would push that to getbook they actually get an NFT if it gets merged by the admin. And there's something called only approver in the contract that would make sure only the approver's address would be allowed to minute. But once you push that on there, then that will then become part of the polygon quest and that will be part of the new NFT. And we'll actually keep track of that with the versioning within the NFT. I don't know if that answers maybe a little bit what you were getting at.
01:42:44.260 - 01:43:22.040, Speaker A: Okay, exactly. I want to understand the flow. I think it's really cool that you were able to do yeah, that's the yeah. So another great design, another good looking front end. Can you guys give us a little bit of your stack in terms of building that experience? Sure, I go with the front end and then Jamie, if you want to follow so we've used Next JS and ceramic. There's a ceramic instance running in the browser, but we also have a ceramic instance running in server, and those contain different data. We're using IDX on top of ceramic to index the data.
01:43:22.040 - 01:43:56.862, Speaker A: The chain link, using chain link to read ceramic data. I've never heard of someone doing that. That's so interesting. Like when I think of a quiz, I think maybe they're going to do like some commit reveal on chain. No, you load it to ceramic and then you use an oracle to make sure that it's in ceramic and correct. That's good stuff. So one other kind of comment to make here is you want to think about when you're building a platform on ethereum, you want to think about incentives and how to incentivize folks to create quizzes.
01:43:56.862 - 01:44:35.360, Speaker A: Is that something that you guys are thinking about? Like, I don't know, there's a lot of different ways to incentivize. Maybe I'll go ahead. Sure. Yeah, for sure. So we're actually planning we are working with a couple of members from the Token Engineering Academy as well to create some kind of squads which would be subdos inside of the we imagine to become a Dao. So they would be subdos and we will create incentivization compatible programs to be able to keep the squads collaborate with each other and also kind of create contents where the project owners or the subject matter experts can validate the content of the course. And there will be prices from the community pool as well.
01:44:35.360 - 01:45:17.018, Speaker A: One little piece I dig into Too is like, quizzes are okay, but if you're already having this almost like results oracle kind of thing, that happens. I imagine more of a build challenge where it's like, can you create this thing? Can you build this? And we can give you NFTs. Going through a quiz is good, but it's really just kind of like testing a thing going through the quiz isn't that fun of an experience, but if you could make it something more really onboarding them and saying, okay, you got the tools up, you got this thing built, it's deployed here, we can check that. Now you get this. So that's another thing I'd love to see too, is more of a build challenge. Maybe. Kelly, you could also mention branch and decrypted courses.
01:45:17.018 - 01:45:50.250, Speaker A: So we have branch paths that are focused for the end user and then we have decrypted paths that will be more focused on code challenges, bounties, et cetera. And those would be like tutorial, educational courses, like tutorials made with the teams. Like course structures would be made with the project members and would be created the content would be created by the community and gets validated by the project team as well. So it's like a decentralized on chain and the content would be decentralized as well. Good project. Let's onboard some people. Good job.
01:45:50.250 - 01:46:10.686, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you guys. I love it. Thank you, Team Discovery, that was actually our last team of the session, so I think we're pretty much done now. So thank you judges. Thank you to all the participants in the hackathon this time around.
01:46:10.686 - 01:46:36.820, Speaker A: And if there's nothing further I think we can go ahead and end the seminar. Judges, I think you're supposed to receive an email from Kartik too, if you want to say something. Kartik, I don't know if there's anything else we need to cover. Yeah, this is great. Thank you to all the hackers who presented, and we'll follow up with all the teams on discord, and then I'll follow up with all the judges over email. So thanks again. Thank you, guys.
01:46:36.820 - 01:46:48.140, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Cameron, if you can go ahead and end the meeting, I think all right, thank you. I think you're the host. Oh, me? Okay. Yeah. Okay, I guess we'll just end the meeting. Okay.
01:46:48.140 - 01:46:51.078, Speaker A: Have a good day, everybody. Bye.
