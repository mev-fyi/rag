00:00:00.090 - 00:00:22.952, Speaker A: Thanks, guys. Stand by on the stream. Okay, we're good. Awesome. Sweet. Well, let's kick this thing off then. Great.
00:00:22.952 - 00:01:03.050, Speaker A: Well, you know, we're really excited to be starting this AMA for hackfs with the fleet team here. We with Bret, we have Jensen, and then we have Harrison kind of all co founders from the Fleek side. We're really excited to be working with Fleek for the hackerfest events, providing really key I think infrastructure and technologies allow people to build really awesome projects for this know, obviously. Thanks so much for being here. Just so that everybody kind of knows the format, I'll start off with kind of a little bit sort of early probing questions, and then after that, we'll move into actual questions from the audience. So it'll probably be about 20 minutes. 20 minutes, and then probably wrap up after about 45 minutes.
00:01:03.050 - 00:01:28.530, Speaker A: So cool. So with that being said, let's kick this thing off. Maybe we'll start with bread and then we can just move down the list on your end. But I'd love to kind of know a little bit more about just, like, your early career. If you went to school, what did you study, what were some of the first things you worked on? Just kind of get a sense of basically where you started.
00:01:31.600 - 00:01:35.660, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Should we start with just, like, intros from three of us real quick?
00:01:35.730 - 00:01:36.696, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Yeah.
00:01:36.818 - 00:01:43.056, Speaker B: All right. Harrison, you want to start or you want me to you can go first. Okay.
00:01:43.238 - 00:01:43.584, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:43.622 - 00:01:59.610, Speaker B: So I'm one of the co founders and the COO at Fleek doing a whole bunch of different kind of we're still pretty small team, relatively speaking, so we definitely pitch in a lot of different areas. Yeah.
00:02:04.220 - 00:02:05.896, Speaker A: Cool. Maybe Harrison next.
00:02:06.078 - 00:03:05.752, Speaker C: Sure. So I'm Harrison, also co founder at Fleek. Before this started a company in the space called Token Foundry that I worked on with Janison as well. And that's where we met Brett at Consensus. He was working on another project there called Balance Three, and we decided to start a company together in late summer of 2018. We were originally called Terminal, and then given we had come from like, an ethereum background, we had started with a focus on the ethereum space. And then after about a year, we decided to focus on the distributed web aspect of Web Three and really focus on IPFS and textile and filecoin.
00:03:05.752 - 00:03:15.890, Speaker C: And so that's where when we decided to rebrand to Fleek early this year. And that's about it.
00:03:18.900 - 00:03:31.030, Speaker D: And my name is Janison. Nice to meet you all. Also co founder CTO, and I met Bret and Harrison while we were at yeah.
00:03:33.160 - 00:03:54.750, Speaker A: Very cool. Awesome. So maybe we'll jump back to Bret. Bret, maybe you want to speak to a little bit about sort of your background and how you got into everything and I guess more specifically where you first started your career. And as well, probably your first maybe AHA moment in the crypto space. I think that'd be cool to hear.
00:03:55.360 - 00:04:40.904, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I went to school for accounting. I studied accounting and I went to graduate school for accounting as well in New York at Fordham. And before I even started my graduate program, I had learned about Ethereum and was meeting people in the New York area, especially the Consensus. And that's where the idea kind of around Balance was starting up instead of graduating and going to work at a big four accounting firm. Well, I guess I had my AHA moment already just around Ethereum and Smart contracts and being able to build new types of applications. So I was really excited about that.
00:04:40.904 - 00:05:51.010, Speaker B: I knew I wanted to get into the space so took the opportunity to go right out of school to Consensus and start the Balance project with a couple of other guys that was like instead of going into a big four accounting type thing. So we built Balance for about a year and a half or so before I decided to leave and go with Harrison and Janison to start Fleek or Terminal at the time. But yeah, Balance was like a QuickBooks for crypto type thing helped having a background accounting. I pretty much manage all the product and engineers from UX to execution of actually building the software and testing it and releasing it as well as the business developments as well. So getting like a lot of our customers were like token sale companies, a lot of the DApps in the space. Our first three customers were like Aragon, Gnosis and Digix. Dow is like 2017 pretty early on.
00:05:51.010 - 00:06:02.150, Speaker B: So we just went one by one and got all the different DAPs that did like token sales to do their accounting on the platform and then yeah, very cool.
00:06:02.680 - 00:06:05.830, Speaker A: How about maybe Jenison? Maybe some more question to you.
00:06:06.440 - 00:07:15.820, Speaker D: Yeah, so I studied computer engineering at University of Waterloo here in Canada a while ago seems, and then I was doing enterprise consulting at Deloitte on very legacy old fashioned software and then there was a block rumblings around the blockchain Ethereum space. So when I started looking at it, it just blew my mind from a distributed smart contracting perspective and that's when I started playing around with it. And then we kind of grew the practice there and started doing POCs and presentations for clients and then I think I was hitting a plateau there in terms of being able to release product and things in a consulting environment. So that was when I made the switch to Consensus and Token Foundry and that's kind of where I started more on the startup venture kind of side of things and building a product and it was quite the learning curve at first and now here with Terminal and Fleek. So that's been my journey.
00:07:17.120 - 00:07:26.370, Speaker A: Very cool. Awesome. And then last but not least maybe Harrison, I think you already chat a little bit about it in the intro, but if you want to add a little bit more color too.
00:07:27.300 - 00:08:34.724, Speaker C: Sure. Well, I'd say as an AHA moment, I was watching the space. I was very interested in the Token sales that were happening because before Token Foundry I had helped early on with a company called Seed Invest, which was big in the crowdfunding world. So I lived through the Jobs Act and that whole regulation and trying to make crowdfunding become a thing and it just never really took off because of the regulations and a few other factors. But then when I saw the Token sales, I kind of had this AHA moment that this is what crowdfunding was supposed to be. And then after the Dow hack, the real AHA moment, I believe the next sale that happened was singular DTV in October or November of 2016. And that was the first post Dow hack sale and I was not sure how it was going to go.
00:08:34.724 - 00:09:08.240, Speaker C: And I think it sold out in like 6 seconds or something crazy. And they raised like, I think seven and a half million dollars. And that's what made me realize like, okay, that hack didn't scare that many people away and this is going to become a big thing. And that's when I decided I wanted to start a business around legitimatizing Token sales. And that's where I met Joe and started Token Foundry and then the rest how we got here, bret and Janison kind of covered.
00:09:09.940 - 00:09:35.770, Speaker A: Awesome cool. Not sure who to turn this question over to, but we've chatted about sort of you've all met at know, working on maybe some different projects and then all joining up for Hook and Foundry at one point. How does the idea for Fleek then terminal? How do you guys kind of get to that idea and kind of what about that idea is really, I guess, what had you pursue it as a full time company?
00:09:38.060 - 00:11:32.632, Speaker C: Yeah, I think after building Token Foundry and Bret building Balance, I think we had similar thoughts and ideas as a lot of people who were building in the space in 2016 1718, which was like the infrastructure and the process of building on this new infrastructure was pretty difficult. And so a lot of the issues and pain points we were dealing with ourselves, building companies on top of Ethereum, we thought it would be a good idea to try to make that an easier process and build tools to make the process and running products that utilize these new types of infrastructure easy. And so that was the original sort of idea was to build tools and products that make it easier for people to adopt and utilize web three technologies. I would say, as I mentioned before, we started on Ethereum because that's where our background was. But after sort of just understanding the whole web three landscape and how things were going to play out, we kind of just went down. I would say the IPFS rabbit hole in fall of last year. And I think it was a similar feeling to going down the Ethereum rabbit hole in 2016 where it was just like, wow, what role this could play in the web could be enormous in terms of how many its potential and being a replacement for TCPIP or Http.
00:11:32.632 - 00:12:17.230, Speaker C: And we just felt like not many people were paying attention. A lot of people are paying attention to Ethereum now and what the potential was and the different use cases. But we felt given IPFS was launched around the same time as Ethereum and given the web stack know where different pieces of it fit in, we just felt like there was a lot that if there's a distributed web, IPFS felt like it would be the base and everything else would kind of be on top of that. And so we felt at this stage of the market and where we felt like we could build value was really on top of that. So that's kind of how we arrived here from that previous experience.
00:12:19.040 - 00:12:45.700, Speaker A: Gotcha very cool and I think I really want to chat about that transition to sign up for the IPFS ecosystem. Maybe in a couple of questions from now, but I guess maybe I'm curious, what did you guys first start with when you first started building out Terminal at that time? What was kind of the core features that you guys first built and kind of what at that time made it so that the market was really looking for those types of features.
00:12:47.160 - 00:13:58.332, Speaker C: So we started as pretty much an infrastructure provider, kind of like the infira alchemies of the world. And we were focused. I think we were a little early but I'm glad to see it starting to take off now but sort of like trying to abstract away from the smart contract layer and creating custom APIs and things beyond. Just like a node endpoint so people could do some of the crazy magic they're doing across protocols now with yield farming and what DeFi Zap is doing and stuff like that, but in a generalized way. But the infrastructure space I would say was quite crowded and the DAP market just isn't that big even still. And we saw a lot of people who maybe failed at their first idea as a DAP or as a protocol kind of pivot into the infrastructure space. So we just felt like it wasn't a battle we wanted to fight.
00:13:58.332 - 00:14:44.296, Speaker C: There seemed to be some pretty good infrastructure players out there. So then we actually pivoted to analytics because we said infrastructure is getting pretty competitive and we're not sure how it's going to play out. Maybe it goes more decentralized with things like pocket network and the graph and people leveraging more decentralized networks for the infrastructure needs. There's companies providing the centralized options. But what would be something that regardless of whose infrastructure they're using, something they're all going to need. And what we saw trend wise was that as in 2017, you had maybe just infuria and MetaMask. Today's DApps are way more advanced.
00:14:44.296 - 00:15:25.512, Speaker C: You're using tons of and one contract back then, like a sale contract now you had ten contracts, 15 different wallet providers, a few different infrastructure providers. So we thought all this data is either with the wallet providers because it's being submitted through their node or their infrastructure provider. So the DApps didn't really have insight into what was going on and a lot of them are using the same contract. So you can't just go to Ether Scan and look at what specific activity is coming from your specific front end. So we then pivoted from infrastructure to analytics. We built an analytics platform. That one actually went pretty well.
00:15:25.512 - 00:16:29.020, Speaker C: We had like 30 or 40 DApps using it and it was integrated, it was like an SDK. They just wrapped all their sources and we would just funnel it all in and decode it and make it super nice and easy to use. But again, we just felt that market timing and sizing wise, it was hard to justify a business that we felt like we could grow and sustain in the next one to three years. So that's when we really took a step back and started to rethink. What are DApps? What constitutes a DAP. Is that the correct way to think about DApps? Is that definition of adapt going to evolve over time? What might DAPs look like in the future? And kind of what we like. The AHA moment for us was thinking about most of the products we use today and really struggling to understand for 90% of them where smart contracts might fit in.
00:16:29.020 - 00:17:07.992, Speaker C: Because if you think about Twitter, Facebook, any social platform, any blog or news site, you read pretty much anything. It's not initially apparent where smart contracts might fit in. Maybe for payments, maybe for off. But the site, the experience itself, we just felt like there are other things that might make sense to distribute or decentralize first. Maybe it's the hosting, maybe it's the storage, maybe it's the data. There's a huge, I think, push with user data issues. With the Twitter hack this week, with Reddit censoring certain subreddits, it's becoming an issue.
00:17:07.992 - 00:17:41.828, Speaker C: So we just felt like that was potentially a bigger market and easier transition from web two to web three for people to get behind. And so that was kind of what made us then finally switch from analytics to IPFS based products and fleek. And so yeah, it was quite the journey. Few pivots involved. We're not done yet, but especially in this space, I feel like what you have to do to survive, definitely I.
00:17:41.834 - 00:18:10.590, Speaker A: Think the flexibility, I think the space moving so quickly, being able to be flexible and adapt, that I think the best way to survive. Cool. Maybe we'll bring it over to Bret. We keep mentioning Terminal, which was the old name for Fleek. Maybe it would be good to get an idea behind how you guys came up with, I guess first of all, the idea behind Rebranding, why you felt that was the right time to do so, and also maybe just a little bit insight of what that process was like.
00:18:12.720 - 00:18:44.200, Speaker B: Okay, yeah. Well, we were still called Terminal when we launched the hosting IPFS product. So we had stuck with the name. We liked the name a lot. I guess since the beginning there was always a bit of confusion slightly where Terminal is already a common developer tool and we were building developer tools, so we always kind of had it in the back of our head. But we did like the name and it resonated well for the majority of people.
00:18:44.270 - 00:18:44.890, Speaker A: And.
00:18:47.420 - 00:19:28.396, Speaker B: We figured it would only make sense to maybe change the name if we were going to completely focus on something different, new. So once we launched the hosting product, the immediate feedback was pretty resounding. There was a lot of beta sign ups even before we made it public. And we one by one onboarded each developer in the beginning for the first 100 to 200 to get a ton of feedback. And during that process, there was a few articles that we announced that were shared across a few channels. One of them was Hacker News and some of the comments over there were talking about our name. Like the Terminal name had been confusing.
00:19:28.396 - 00:20:01.360, Speaker B: They didn't understand it. I think it was a small amount. But at that point we were seeing that this product was definitely the direction that was working and made sense, so that we should double down and really push that way so that's when we were like, okay, we can kind of take the opportunity to go for a rebrand and the naming. I think we went through a few different names before we chose Fleek.
00:20:03.780 - 00:20:04.096, Speaker A: Trying.
00:20:04.118 - 00:20:22.552, Speaker B: To remember the name that we were thinking about before Fleek that we almost settled on. But we look, you remember Disco? Disco, yeah, we do. Disco because it's like short for distributed computing or like not computing. I'm blanking, I don't remember.
00:20:22.606 - 00:20:24.890, Speaker C: But anyways, I think that's what it was for.
00:20:25.260 - 00:21:32.764, Speaker B: Yeah, distributed computers maybe because it was kind of like nodes. And we were always thinking that long term, the IPFS protocol, the platform, the way it would grow would be, it would enable peer to peer apps so that this kind of distributed computers or computing, however you want to call it, would be a delivery network of apps. So when users use apps, they can deliver each other content. So that was kind of like the long term thinking we were going for. And we thought Disco was super cool and it sounded kind of like funky and just exciting. But I think we looked it up and found a company that was called Disco and then we were actually legally changing our name and we had already started talking to lawyers so we were like a last minute like, oh, we should not go with this name, we should go with a different name. And then we came up with the name in one sitting in like an hour, I think.
00:21:32.764 - 00:22:19.260, Speaker B: We went through a bunch of different names. Harrison's, one that threw out the name Fleek. He said it and then we were kind of all just like wow, it's pretty cool and it's short and it's five letters. What's all these different words? Zoom and slack. And what do all them even like? They're just short and they didn't really have common uses and software yet and they're easy to remember and kind of verbs are easy to talk about. So we brought it back and also we thought of the concept of like since it's hosting, if your site is on fleek, it's like a cool term and exciting for people to be able to say that their site is really cool. So that was kind of the process of the rebrand.
00:22:20.080 - 00:22:48.470, Speaker A: Sweet. I think Disco is a pretty solid name too, but I think Fleek's got a pretty cool ring to it. Awesome, maybe. I'd kind of love to get a sense of maybe the latest launch that you guys had, which you also have a bounty attached to for this event, which is the Space Damon. I guess I'd love to kind of get a quick intro to what that is and also just what excites you about it. Maybe I'll go to Janison for this.
00:22:49.720 - 00:23:40.356, Speaker D: Yeah. So it came about know as we were moving into our next product around desktop storage called Space. We needed a place to have a peer to peer node and do the heavy lifting. And it's parallel to if you download Dropbox and there's a system tray in the corner that sits as a local backend for your app and your Light UIs, whether it's Electron app or a browser, can interact with it. So that's kind of how it came about. And then what really excites me about it is two things. One is the ability to gain network effect if it's bundled up with a really popular app, now everyone has a node in it and now other apps and web apps can leverage it.
00:23:40.356 - 00:24:34.664, Speaker D: And then the optimizations from that, like if there's many different apps using Textile Filecoin IPFS, just the ability to kind of synergize that computation into one unit. And if maybe it's one lib PTP host that all of them share instead of each one having its own. Being able to share other resources between those components and just devs. Being able to quickly start developing on this with simple APIs and configuration, but the ability to kind of go deeper and extend it and add stuff to it. And I guess the third thing that's also really exciting is this is kind of how we entered into the open source community. So all things space is open source. And I think that's super like the team is super excited about it, and we've already started getting outside kind of input on it.
00:24:34.664 - 00:24:37.530, Speaker D: And so that's super exciting for me and the team.
00:24:39.100 - 00:24:47.470, Speaker A: Awesome. I guess that also means that people that are hacking on it over the next month or so have a good opportunity to just make PRS and fix it themselves if they're having any issues.
00:24:48.080 - 00:24:50.510, Speaker D: For sure, we'll gladly review those.
00:24:51.840 - 00:25:24.120, Speaker A: Sounds good. Awesome. And then maybe just like a last question for me and I'll turn it over to the crowd here. What is kind of the next maybe five or even ten years? I know it's hard to say, especially if you've got two pivots under your belt already. What's that going to look like for fleek, do you think? Are you excited about the current track? Are there other things you're considering adding on top of things? Obviously space you mentioned if you're able to chat about that, but just kind of get a sense for kind of what the future for fleet holds.
00:25:25.660 - 00:26:14.890, Speaker C: Sure. So we are definitely set in this direction for now. I don't know if I could swing a fourth pivot and frame it as a positive thing, but we feel good about this direction. With each product, the traction has come quicker and our potential market is bigger. And so that's a framework. I think being in Web Three, you kind of are just praying it's going to have this explosive growth and you could grow with it and create a sustainable business. But we want to make sure we survive those five to ten years and really help Web Three happen and play a part in it.
00:26:14.890 - 00:27:20.412, Speaker C: And so with the moves we're making now, it's both what we feel could make the biggest impact for helping get Web Three adoption, but in very nice packaged ways that it's irrelevant what's happening under the hood. We're really not trying to sell protocol features. We're trying to sell value propositions that make sense to end consumers or businesses. And so what we are focused on now is we basically have two different buckets of activity that we're focused on. One is the Fleek platform, which is the developer platform. And the goal there is to make it super easy for people to build p to p private encrypted first apps, whether they're native apps or web apps, and Kind. Of like a firebase for those type of apps and make it just super simple to kind of get and use all these different things.
00:27:20.412 - 00:28:03.100, Speaker C: You need to create an app or integrate this functionality into an app or a site and take advantage of the benefits. And the main benefits we're focused on to start with are the privacy encryption, P to P benefits. Then we did release the space daemon and that is a sort of a prequel or a preview of we're releasing in a few weeks. We'll probably announce it next week. Space Desktop app, which is essentially a Dropbox alternative. So, like, what Signal is for messaging, space is for cloud storage. So storing files in the cloud is very Web Two.
00:28:03.100 - 00:28:38.896, Speaker C: Storing files in space is very Web Three. And Space is a combination of IPFS, textile and optionally filecoin. So if you don't want, like, you store the files on your machine or machines, you can share and collaborate on files and documents with your team. It works with all existing tools, but everything is private, encrypted by default. And when you send or share something with someone, it's completely peer to peer. There's no third party Google or Dropbox or anyone playing gatekeeper. And we use the Space daemon to build that app.
00:28:38.896 - 00:29:34.090, Speaker C: And so what we are showing with the Space Desktop app is A, what you could use the Space daemon to build. That's just one example. It's just basic storage. But B, what the goal is, is that now people could use the daemon or space to build whatever front ends they want off of the heavy lifting the daemon does. So you could build a private user owned GitHub or Slack or Reddit or whatever you want and use these open source frameworks to kind of do it super easily. And now you have a fleet platform that makes it easy to build them. And then we kind of are focused on, besides the platform, like I said, the Space Desktop app, and really trying to usher in a new generation of apps that do put privacy and user owned data first and user owned accounts first.
00:29:34.090 - 00:30:23.210, Speaker C: And kind of like, we feel that's a pretty good road into getting Web Two people to use Web Three. And it's not like necessarily everyone knows how signals encryption work. They just kind of understand the value proposition and use it. And so that's what we're trying to accomplish with Space is not necessarily need someone to know how IPFS works or filecoin works or textile works. They just know, I could use this instead of using Dropbox or Google Drive. And now I am 100% certain that only me and the people I share these files with are the people who have access to these files and no one's spying on me, and so on and so forth. So that's kind of like what we're focused on.
00:30:23.210 - 00:31:22.190, Speaker C: And we are hopeful that a product like that could pick up very quickly in terms of use. Dropbox alone has 500 million users. Cloud storage is something most people in the world are familiar with using. And we do feel that a good portion of people do care about privacy. And if you have a product that is private by default or you have someone spying on you by default, and both products are pretty similar feature wise and what you could do with them that people will especially with everything going on in the world this week and this past few months. We feel that privacy and encryption and P to P are going to be like sought after features and benefits of not only cloud storage, but other products that we hope people build using the daemon we just use to build space. And that's kind of what we're betting on for the next twelve to 18 months.
00:31:22.190 - 00:31:36.050, Speaker C: But that space app will be out next month, so we hope by September, October we have a pretty good idea if the market agrees with our assessment of product market fit.
00:31:37.780 - 00:31:54.870, Speaker A: Very cool. That sounds awesome. Yeah, I mean, as somebody who uses cloud storage every day as a key functionality would be great for that piece of my life and my stack, if you will, to also be decentralized. So you've got a user here, so just let me know when it's out.
00:31:55.720 - 00:31:58.870, Speaker C: Amazing. We will definitely get you on the beta list.
00:31:59.500 - 00:32:15.452, Speaker A: Sounds good. Sweet. Awesome. So maybe I'll turn it over here. Just want to see if anybody in here have a question about fleek to the fleek team. If so, you can either raise your hand or just unmute. That would help, too.
00:32:15.452 - 00:32:51.836, Speaker A: If not, I can keep asking questions. All right. Maybe I'll just keep asking questions. Awesome. I guess I asked this question in the last one. I think it was pretty interesting to hear, I guess early stage when you were building out terminal at that time. You'd love to kind of know about some of the kind of best decisions you made kind of early on that you think kind of led you to success or otherwise kept things going.
00:32:51.836 - 00:33:03.280, Speaker A: And then sort of like some of the kind of tougher decisions that didn't pan out the way you expected. It'd be great to kind of hear a little bit about those early days and some of those tough decisions.
00:33:04.420 - 00:34:02.836, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So I'd say I'll start with the mistakes coming off of the Token Foundry success and the craziness of the market. We definitely hired too quickly and grew too fast before proving anything in the market. And we took way too long to launch our first product without getting any feedback and kind of just thinking we knew what was right and what was best and we were pretty wrong and we wasted a lot of time and a lot of money early on figuring that out. That was the biggest mistake. The best thing we did right is not a being too married to our own original ideas, putting ego aside, being able to say, all right, we were wrong. What's wrong here? Let's figure it out and let's fix it.
00:34:02.836 - 00:34:48.710, Speaker C: Not once, but twice and continually. We're always relooking at what are we doing? Does it make sense? Can we believe this story? Because if we can ourselves believe this story, it's going to be very hard to convince other people, whether it's investors or users of the product or what have you. So I'd say the best. Decision we made was we had some pretty good success with the analytics product. I mean, we had 30 or 40 integrations within three months of launching it. We launched it, I believe October like first, and by the end of the year we had 30 or 40 integrations. But it was really at that point, I think most people would have said, all right, this is working, let's keep going.
00:34:48.710 - 00:36:03.928, Speaker C: And instead we kind of extrapolated out and said, where could this be in twelve months from now? Instead of 30 DApps, maybe we have 100 or 200. How quickly is this market going to grow? And is this going to be something where we could get to cash flow, break even with the money we still have just to be able to control our own destiny and not have to rely on venture capital because we don't know how long this market is going to take to play out. And so we made the tough decision to not only not continue to focus on analytics and do something new, but also make the decision that running this analytics product is a waste of resources and infrastructure cost. So let's just completely shut it down. And so we did from new idea, launch product, get traction, and shut it down all within a four month time span. But it focused us, it allowed us to downsize, it cut our infrastructure costs, and it allowed us to put all of our attention onto the new IPFS direction, which we inside believed was the right move. So it was a tough few months.
00:36:03.928 - 00:36:46.232, Speaker C: It was hard to convince investors and people what we were doing wasn't insane, but luckily we were right. And we came out of the other, on the other side of it at least. Okay, for now. Still have a lot of work to do to really make it, but you kind of have to trust your own gut, because as the entrepreneur and the co founders, it's really like investors can give you guidance, but they don't know at the end of the day, what's best. And no one will really know besides you what's best. And sometimes you're wrong, sometimes you're right. But I think Nabal says it a lot.
00:36:46.232 - 00:36:54.570, Speaker C: But the biggest indicator of startup success is how quickly a team can iterate. And I think that's very true. So we kind of live by that.
00:36:57.340 - 00:37:33.290, Speaker A: Awesome. That's a, that's a super bold decision. I'm happy to see that panned out for you. That is a very tough choice. That's a good answer. Cool. So I guess you said, like you said, you guys are kind of very focused on fleek and everything, but if you were to put yourself in the position of some of the people hacking, basically, if you had a month of free time and resources and people to help you out, what do you think you'd build for Hack FS? What are some of the ideas you've been playing around with, yeah, what would you build?
00:37:34.220 - 00:38:54.508, Speaker C: So we're of the opinion that there could be a new renaissance in terms of DApps that is about to happen. And we think it'll basically be not like the token sales and DFI, but it'll be applications that are built on top of this distributed web stack where privacy encryption, P to P focused apps are built. And so that's really what I think is most exciting, because none of this was possible six months ago. I mean, textiles work that they've done to actually make encryption on top of IPFS possible with their just threads and buckets and their whole protocol and infrastructure set up and how that benefits using IPFS and what's possible. And now with the launch of Filecoin, it's really like privacy encryption is a big trend. And P to P, Slack Spotify, some of these zoom, these big companies are already leveraging some of these technologies, but they're just doing it for their own internal benefit. Now with things like powergate, with Textile, with the Space Daemon, which makes it super easy to just access all those things in a few API calls.
00:38:54.508 - 00:40:31.116, Speaker C: You can make a private like basically, all you have to do now is build a front end and you could build a private p to p version of GitHub of slack of any product instagram Reddit whatever YouTube whatever you could possibly imagine is a big product in web two. Now, the stack is ready to actually build that on a Web Three user owned P to P stack, where it's on the user's machine. They have their own keys, they own their account, they own all the data, but they could log in and access this application and not need to worry about a big company spying on them or censoring them or doing whatever. So really, when you think about that stack and what it enables, anything is possible. So I think there are easy, low hanging fruit of web Two products that are popular and work, but have censorship issues or user data privacy issues, like the hack that happened with Twitter this week, that could happen with any company, that could happen with GitHub. And there was articles people were writing about how dangerous that is, where you could pay an employee to go delete some repo of code and your entire organization could be really in bed. If you have the option of not sharing your data with someone else, if you don't have to, why would you? And so if you take that value proposition, you could pretty much apply it to any use case of the Internet or product that people use on the Internet or on their phones.
00:40:31.116 - 00:41:13.004, Speaker C: And so I would pick something that you're personally interested in, because startups always work out better when you're working on a personal passion project, but leverage these new technologies to create that product, but with privacy encryption and P to P first. So that's literally, I think, what most apps will be in five to ten years. And we just released the daemon. It makes it super easy. Textile is releasing a bunch of cool stuff. Filecoin is about to launch. So now is the perfect time to be like, the first mover, potentially leader in that product.
00:41:13.004 - 00:41:30.790, Speaker C: But taking privacy and user data seriously, I think will be a winning formula this decade. And people like Fred Wilson agree. And it seems like privacy, encryption, P to P will be the trend of this decade. So now is literally the perfect time.
00:41:32.680 - 00:41:34.470, Speaker A: Cool. Couldn't agree more.
00:41:35.640 - 00:43:08.268, Speaker B: As far as building in the hackathon too, how could you kind of show this off? I think that like Harrison saying if you pick a use case, you pick some sort of app that you think should have user controlled accounts and data, whatever that is, and apply this kind of data structure to it, this architecture to it, where whatever the app is, maybe it's like a YouTube app. Whatever files the user uploads or videos that are uploaded, et cetera. The app itself can actually point to the user's local space, like their daemon on their machine. And the user can store all the data that they upload, all this data that they interact with through the application. And that really is like I mean, we've been talking about what's the centralized web users storing own data for years, and this is like a really tangible way to attack it. It's like, all right, let the user actually, if he's running a daemon on the machine, can just store all of it locally and then actually build and have an interface where the app, as they need the data, can interface with them. So, like, having some sort of API where the app can say, all right, as we need data or information to surface or to make experiences with the app, we can request that from the user, sort of like via interface.
00:43:08.268 - 00:43:52.076, Speaker B: But the actual data, the repository of the data, is on the user's machine, and it's as private as they want it to be. So being able to show that off is, I think, a huge milestone. And if you could even just POC that with some sort of app, and the hackathon would be like, I think, mind blowing. And then just to think about it, the daemon itself, sure. Right now it works best with native apps. So if you have a native app, if you're building native app, and that's where the experience is built around, it's really perfect. If you're building around a Web app, the user does will need to have the daemon locally.
00:43:52.076 - 00:45:18.380, Speaker B: However, we are making it so that the daemon can kind of be hosted as a service and still trustless. So you can provide a web app experience without the user having necessarily have the Damon locally on their machine, as well as obviously, when the space app comes out, that will be an option for apps to be able to point to as a directory to store app data. So those are both coming out very soon. So thinking about being able to hit a really solid POC that really shows off this D web ethos where the user controls their account interacting with an app, and all the data that they interact with that app is stored locally and lets the app use it as they please, and then realizing, okay, this is a really good POC, even if it's locally on the machine, and that this can be hosted for the user so they don't ever have to download anything. Or also that they could have a space app, they could have this kind of dropbox equivalent where they can store all their app data in one place. So that's kind of like thinking long term it works out. And even so, once any desktop app uses a daemon, as there's more of an ecosystem around this daemon and there's more desktop apps using it, or just like any type of app using it, other apps and websites can take advantage of that.
00:45:18.380 - 00:45:45.140, Speaker B: So it really just needs to get in there once. So the space app probably is one way, but other popular apps could also bring this to more users and bring this kind of sort of operating system or way that apps can interact in a more peer to peer privacy focused way. So long term, I think, yeah, the experience is definitely going in the right direction.
00:45:47.080 - 00:45:53.464, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. Maybe I'll turn it over to Jennison maybe for the last word on this and we'll maybe wrap up after that.
00:45:53.662 - 00:46:50.970, Speaker D: Yeah, I think as far as hackathon projects like Harrison and Bret mentioned, definitely around the existing apps like Reddit and Know, those are proven ideas, but obviously have the issues of censorship and data. But then I think one idea that our tech lead Daniel mentioned, which I thought was great, was just having a way to share schemas between apps because if you make a health app and you're storing users data on that, you want another health app to leverage that instead of recreating it. So ability to discover different data sets and the schemas and Know have make sure that I think that's a foundation to make them interoperable between different apps. So that was a cool one. We didn't pursue that one, but that's another cool idea. Yeah, that kind of jumps out in addition to the other ideas Bret and Harrison mentioned.
00:46:51.980 - 00:48:00.960, Speaker B: Yeah, that is cool. And I think that there will probably be we want there to be an app ecosystem for sure around this. Obviously, as apps make the interfaces of how they want to request data from the user is an aspect to it where being able to have plugins for different types of apps, I think you could take a current web two app that isn't as Reddit et cetera could use it now. They could say all right, we're done storing user data. Let's just create the proper interface to direct everything to a local space for users. And then we'll also have this interface to be able to read data as we need and want, but not actually have to store it on our servers. Et think it could be put in now, and to Janice's point, hopefully will be an ecosystem around the right schemas interfaces for apps to interact with users, being able to store things locally and interact with their apps.
00:48:03.380 - 00:48:39.790, Speaker A: Very cool. Awesome. Well, I hope everybody on this call you guys are taking notes, because I think what Harrison said, this is really the perfect timing, I think, for a lot of people to be the first movers in whatever they build, and I think that's going to be a really big deal. So awesome. So I think I speak for everybody, big thank you to the Fleek team for coming out and chatting with us. And like I said at the beginning, we're really excited to have you guys on board. Of course, everybody in the chat look into what they're offering as their prizes just from the hosting perspective or whether that's using the space payment.
00:48:39.790 - 00:48:50.750, Speaker A: They've got a lot of cool tech that will make your project a lot faster to build. So take a look at that. And again, thank you so much, gentlemen, for coming out and maybe we'll end it here.
00:48:52.800 - 00:48:56.076, Speaker C: Thanks a lot. Thank you for having us.
00:48:56.258 - 00:48:58.880, Speaker A: Bye. Take care, everybody. Bye.
