00:00:14.320 - 00:00:53.276, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody. Was somebody talking? No. Okay, cool. So we are going to get started in just a second. We are going to use the same document that we did last week, so let me grab the link for that. You're going to want to add your team name and all of the team members who are participating on this call do that and that will be the sign up order that we go through. It's first come, first serve.
00:00:53.276 - 00:01:37.948, Speaker A: So go add your name now to make sure that you have some time to present. And once I see the first name on there, start with room one. We'll fill up room two once we get some more panelists there. And Peter Simona, do you want to just give a quick intro? I know some of the people were probably here last week, but maybe there are some new faces. I'm going to send the link in the chat again, please add your team name. Simona, you want to go first? Team members in the chat?
00:01:38.124 - 00:02:06.724, Speaker B: I can go first. So in a very small nutshell hi everyone, I'm Simona. I am currently heading up community for status. Before that I was the co founder of the Bounties Network, creators of the standard Bounties Protocol. On top of which Gitcoin sits. Most of you will be familiar with Gitcoin. Other than that, I am part of the MetaCartel dao.
00:02:06.724 - 00:02:54.040, Speaker B: Metacama delta whaler dao. There's a whole bunch of DAOs that I'm a part of, but generally I tend to help out across the ecosystem in terms of anything that will help us get to adoption and help us create very meaningful applications that will hopefully get Ethereum mainstream. I've been part of or taking part in the ETH Global hackathons in some way or another for the past, what is it now, three years, and I'm excited to see what you guys have come up with and hopefully I can help with the feedback that I will give you. Great to be here, Peter.
00:02:55.020 - 00:03:30.950, Speaker A: Hi, Brune. Recently I would consider myself a community builder in the space, but recently turned investor. I'm at One KX and I've also created the venture Dow, the first investment Dow on Ethereum and before then worked in MetaCartel and still working on that. So actually looking to work with teams after the hack fund as well and to receive grants from MetaCartel. And yeah, I've been building in the space. So yeah, happy to see what people cook up. Perfect.
00:03:30.950 - 00:03:36.772, Speaker A: Scott, do you want to give a quick 32nd intro? Yeah.
00:03:36.826 - 00:03:46.276, Speaker C: Hey, I'm Scott Lewis. Mainly work on DeFi, pulse and dex.
00:03:46.388 - 00:03:47.050, Speaker A: AG.
00:03:50.880 - 00:04:07.330, Speaker C: I like DeFi. I like most of the stuff people are building. I'm in some Dows, but I don't run any like these other panelists. But yeah, I'm looking forward to see what y'all are building.
00:04:09.060 - 00:04:50.430, Speaker A: Perfect. So we will have a few other people joining us. David and Austin from last week will also be joining in a few minutes, but we're going to get started now. So we're going to have two rooms once they join, and so don't be alarmed if you get pulled into another room where you see your order change on the sheet, which I just linked in the chat. Emily's over there, so if you have any questions, relay them to her, and then we'll get anything figured out. And then we're going to just start right off with the first team, which I believe is stop loss protocol. We're going to keep all three of the panels in here for now, and then once we get some more, like I said, we'll start to split people up.
00:04:50.430 - 00:05:19.876, Speaker A: Stop loss. Do you want to go ahead and present? Hey, so how should I start with the project directly? Yeah, sure. Just remember, I forgot to mention, try to keep it pretty short because we do have a lot of teams, but we're going to allocate five minutes per team. Okay. Just keep that in mind. Thank you. I have to restart my Zoom.
00:05:19.876 - 00:05:47.010, Speaker A: I'm sorry for this. Maybe I'm going to be second team or something like that. Have to quit and rejoin for the screen sharing. Okay, let's go to the next team while he does that, which is 20 pay. Jack Sanford. Hey, guys, how's it going? Can you guys hear me? Cool, thanks.
00:05:47.940 - 00:05:48.928, Speaker D: Okay, cool.
00:05:49.014 - 00:06:06.390, Speaker A: Yeah. So we're 20 pay, and basically we are creating a very easy to use ecommerce checkout, so you can pay with any, ERC, 20 token. So let me share my screen really quick. Hopefully this goes well.
00:06:13.280 - 00:06:14.060, Speaker D: Um.
00:06:18.870 - 00:06:42.624, Speaker A: Zoom. Oh, yeah. It's making me do the same thing that the last guy was doing. It's going to make me quit Zoom. Okay. I'm not sure if I should should I just get back in the line after he goes, then? Yeah, we'll jump back once you restart. But yeah, go ahead and restart.
00:06:42.624 - 00:06:51.616, Speaker A: Okay, sorry about that. No worries. All right, let's see if we can get new fi, do you want to go ahead and present? Hopefully you don't have to restart.
00:06:51.648 - 00:06:55.350, Speaker E: All right, let's see. Yeah, this will be the test.
00:06:56.840 - 00:06:57.990, Speaker A: There we go.
00:06:59.660 - 00:07:21.436, Speaker E: Good deal. That got me scared. All right, cool. New phi. Our project is growing. Your net worth has never been this easy, and our target is really the crypto curious, crypto nervous. The 93% of the population that doesn't have exposure to digital assets.
00:07:21.436 - 00:08:01.736, Speaker E: We all know getting people into this ecosystem is a challenge, and there's just so many options in the DFI world. Scott, you mentioned D five Pulse, and all these different tools are out there, but it's still really difficult to get into this stuff. But there are really practical benefits for people owning digital assets. So our project is really to capture that market. So what we're offering is a platform where you can invest with experts, the people that know the most about DeFi and crypto. You choose managers. This is all decentralized and non custodial.
00:08:01.736 - 00:09:16.016, Speaker E: You choose managers that fit your style. You can sort and filter based on how they perform or what they're invested in, what their pools are invested in. And you can allocate into stable or volatile pools that we're calling. So our whole premise is things like yearn and there's a lot of great protocols out there, but really it's still challenging for most people to understand, where should I put my money? So we really broke it down into stable and volatile pools and then the investor has the ability to put their money into those pools in a proportion that really makes sense for them. So this is kind of like understanding the investors risk and allowing them to get into those managers that will get them into investments that will return something for them, but safely as well. So I'll go through the demo and I'll tell you where we are in a few minutes. But this is our UX flow.
00:09:16.016 - 00:10:20.104, Speaker E: We're not completely hooked up at this point, but I want to show you what we have at the moment. So there's two sides to Newfi it's invest or manage. And I'm going to go through the invest flow right now. So first you connect to your web three wallet and then you can see the dashboard of available managers in the here. You know, we see Jim and Jane and their stable and volatile pools and how they're doing overall and how much they've invested themselves into that pool, which could be an indicator of how much confidence they have in their strategy. When you view that pool, you see a breakdown of how it's performing over time and you can actually get into those pools themselves, the volatile or the stable pool. And you'll notice that we have a 1% withdrawal fee, which is really an incentive for the advisor to get onto our system.
00:10:20.104 - 00:11:21.148, Speaker E: And I'll talk more about that when we get into the advisor platform. But really the way that you get in to any of these pools is you invest ETH for volatile pool or you invest USDC, which is the two things that we chose at the moment. So it's very easy to get into these things. Once you provide ETH to the volatile pool, that money then goes into that ETH pool and you're going to see the manager invest that on your behalf and hopefully you have good returns on that. And you can view all of that within your dashboard, within your portfolio. You can also add or withdraw all to get out of that pool. All right, any questions up to this point? Maybe I'll keep going.
00:11:21.148 - 00:12:36.240, Speaker E: On the other side of this, we have our advisor or manager and the manager, as explained, they are the ones who are coming up with the investor pool and coming up with that strategy. So they provide their profile name, which would be seen on that list that I showed before in terms of available managers, they describe their pool strategy and then they could tell us how they want to investors funds in terms of volatile and stable pools. So in terms of volatile they could put in ETH themselves and then we would have some strategies that they could put that money into. And allocate for the hack. Right now we're limiting our options. So for volatile we have yearn, but for stable we have yearn and stable and then they could allocate proportions that they feel are going to outperform. So once they create that pool, this is the manager's dashboard and they would see how they're doing in terms of their fee income.
00:12:36.240 - 00:13:26.336, Speaker E: And this is really the incentive. Like I mentioned, they want to do well because they're going to make more in terms of fees or get more people onto the platform so that they generate more fee income. They can edit their amounts that they have or invest more themselves and they can also invite investors directly. So this is where folks that might not be familiar with DeFi or crypto in general, this could be someone managing and saying, hey, I want to bring you into this system. It's very easy to use, give me your email address, I'll send you a personalized message. And then they could get into assets that are generating return for them. So that is Newfi.
00:13:26.336 - 00:14:05.280, Speaker E: And here's where we're at in terms of the roadmap. We did idea and research at the beginning wireframes, you just were shown. We have developed our contract and we're integrating the front end right now. Eventually we're going to add governance and future investments to the platform. So governance I think is a really huge aspect of the system where advisors will have a say or managers have a say in how we add things to the platform and how this ecosystem grows. So yeah, that is Newfi.
00:14:05.620 - 00:14:40.510, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Why don't we move into questions or feedback? Yeah, I really like the idea. Just like one small idea is in terms of the poll managers, you're really kind of enabling people to manage amongst predefined polls, right? At least that's what I'm assuming. You could probably work with Zapper finances, like Zap contracts because they're already out there. You have over 100 different healthy pool positions amongst balancer, uniswap, et cetera, and you could probably allow people to play with that, right?
00:14:41.680 - 00:14:43.870, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a great idea.
00:14:46.660 - 00:15:01.010, Speaker C: How do you prevent the managers from what's the mechanism that prevents the managers from running off with the money? Is it trustless or like contracts and stuff?
00:15:01.940 - 00:15:29.484, Speaker A: Yeah, is it trustless or no, I can answer. I'm I'm Herman, I'm one of the engineers working on the project. Yeah, it's all smart contract based, right? So there's only a limited amount of stuff you can do in the smart contract. So you give your money technically to a smart contract where the advisor is allowed to put it into urine or something. But they can't transfer that money into wherever they want. Right. They can't just transfer it to their own wallet or they can't transfer anywhere they want.
00:15:29.484 - 00:15:32.430, Speaker A: You see what I mean? So there's strategies they can invest into.
00:15:33.680 - 00:15:39.552, Speaker C: Basically whitelisting classes of transactions they can do okay.
00:15:39.606 - 00:15:54.310, Speaker A: Essentially. Yeah. And so that whitelist can grow based on the governance. So if advisors want to add more different protocols and stuff, they can and they can have a governance token and they can vote on that. But yeah, it is limited to what they can do.
00:15:55.560 - 00:16:10.360, Speaker C: Okay, so it's basically like an arena for different people to do y vaults, kind of if they're like 85 Y vaults and people could yeah. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah.
00:16:10.510 - 00:16:28.016, Speaker A: Cool. Basically. Yeah. And another kind of cool aspect of the manager side of things too, is that for a manager, you don't have to be a crypto expert, right. You have these kind of pre built strategies that you can use and you can kind of get a good feel for it, but you don't have to be the most knowledgeable person, which is kind of a cool thing. What we're kind of trying to go.
00:16:28.038 - 00:16:30.272, Speaker C: For, I mean, I hope wait.
00:16:30.326 - 00:16:30.496, Speaker A: Oh.
00:16:30.518 - 00:16:39.616, Speaker C: To be an investor or manager. Wait, full stop. I want my manager to be an.
00:16:39.638 - 00:16:42.050, Speaker B: Expert for yeah, me too. Yeah.
00:16:42.440 - 00:16:45.830, Speaker C: You can just find someone to do that that knows what they're doing.
00:16:47.720 - 00:17:53.124, Speaker B: I was going to suggest there was a project that was done. Was it East Denver this year or last year? I think it was by the guys behind Pull Together or certainly some of the team members were from Pull Together and it was called High Priests. And you basically followed what these people were doing in terms of causes or projects that they supported and you put your money or like you followed what they did so that you would also put your money behind whatever projects they were supporting. But like Scott says, they were, let's say experts. Right. Like I would trust those people to pick projects based on experience, based on know how, all of that pick projects that would be winning or would be beneficial. So you want those guys to be experts and you want to have a very simple follow mechanism so that you actually put that before any other steps.
00:17:53.172 - 00:18:30.820, Speaker C: If you're talking about noobs, yeah, I don't know. I agree with everything I just said, and I don't know what the jail risk is for managers, but if that's really low and you all had users that actually wanted this, it seems like something that would be pretty attractive. Because for an expert, not only can you make some money, you can also sort of show your expertise to the community, which is kind of like generally also an incentive.
00:18:31.480 - 00:18:51.804, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. When I say expert, I kind of mean you don't have to be a technologist, you don't have to be a programmer to understand what you're doing, right? You understand finance, you can learn more about crypto, you can start understanding how returns work, but you don't have to build your own smart contracts. You don't have to have that kind of technical knowledge, I guess, is what I mean.
00:18:51.922 - 00:18:56.076, Speaker C: You probably still want people that know people like agree.
00:18:56.178 - 00:19:33.736, Speaker A: I totally agree in principle with Simone and Scott here, but taking the other stance, I think someone's going to build this tool, right? And it's kind of permissionless, in a way. Someone's going to build a permissionless pool manager that kind of curates a bunch of preset possible whitelisted pools. Right. Someone's going to do this, I think. And I think there's going to be a recklessness, but this is kind of the nature of web free, I think, as well. Just like it's all permissionless, right? To some extent, I think that's hard.
00:19:33.758 - 00:19:49.492, Speaker C: To prevent people to I know more secrets in the space than you do, Peter. So it's like I'll be able some insight whether there's more curvebugs out there. I think right now there's a lot of insight for Asymmetric.
00:19:49.576 - 00:19:55.890, Speaker B: That's what makes it appealing, right? That's what would make it appealing to me as a new.
00:19:56.580 - 00:19:57.330, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:19:57.860 - 00:20:03.670, Speaker B: I'm getting like a sneak, right? Yes, that's the whole spiel of it.
00:20:06.120 - 00:20:09.700, Speaker A: Any final comments? I do hate to interrupt.
00:20:10.520 - 00:20:13.332, Speaker C: I like it, though. It's great. It's a good idea.
00:20:13.386 - 00:20:14.150, Speaker B: Yeah, same.
00:20:14.860 - 00:20:16.036, Speaker E: Thank you for all the feedback.
00:20:16.068 - 00:20:18.184, Speaker A: I appreciate it. Yeah, it's awesome.
00:20:18.302 - 00:20:19.800, Speaker B: Thanks, guys. Good luck.
00:20:21.340 - 00:20:39.424, Speaker A: All right, hopefully the zoom issues were resolved. We're going to hit back up the list to stop loss. You want to try to share your screen? Yeah. Hey, guys, I'm going to try to do this. Yes, it's working. Okay, awesome. Go ahead.
00:20:39.424 - 00:21:32.908, Speaker A: And remember, it's just five minutes for demo and questions, if you can. Okay, sure. So really quickly, we've seen with a lot of excitement the fact that centralized exchange has been replaced by decentralized exchanges, but they were providing other services like lending. And we've seen Ave that is doing this, and it's great. So building a protocol so that this protocol behaves as what the exchange was doing before in a centralized way that is borrowing from users to others. And so there was this protocol, Avid, that does this borrowing, but centralized exchanges also offered other services like limit orders or stop loss offers. So basically you could say, okay, I'm going to take a risk by getting in this trade, but I want to be sure that in the worst case scenario, I'm going to be liquidated.
00:21:32.908 - 00:22:16.284, Speaker A: And so that I know the worst case scenario, I take risk, but I have a safety guard. And so with these price exchanges, we have kind of lost that. And so stop loss is a protocol to allow you to make stop losses. So we started on impermanent losses. So basically the fact that when you provide liquidity to a pool, you bring two assets like ether and die in the ether die pool. And you could lose a lot of die or a lot of ether because the balance, your liquidity changes. And so that's what the project we've built is.
00:22:16.284 - 00:22:59.084, Speaker A: A project that allows you to bring liquidity to a pool with one token. So it's a protocol. The protocol, what it does is you provide liquidity. You say, I never want liquidity to die, eat, sorry, you provide, let's say, three ether as liquidity in this pool, but you never want the impairment losses to make it so that you have only two ether. So you create a stop loss that says, okay, I provide three ether as liquidity in the pool. But if the impermanent losses make it so that I have only two left, please liquidate me. And so that's how it works.
00:22:59.084 - 00:23:28.980, Speaker A: It's a protocol. You set a maximum loss and then you will have liquidators that will liquidate your position for you. So now the demo. So I unlock my wallet here. So I have Dai, USDC, USDT and these things. And so I can provide liquidity to the pool with die. So it's going to provide liquidity to the pool, die weight, die, eat.
00:23:28.980 - 00:23:58.536, Speaker A: So let's say that I want to provide 200 die. So it's going to convert it for me in ETH, so that I get LP in the end. And I can say, okay, I provide 200 die, but I don't want to lose more than 50 die. I want to be sure to always have 150 die. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to create a stop loss. And so what this transaction does is that first it uses my die to provide liquidity to the pool eater die.
00:23:58.536 - 00:24:48.114, Speaker A: And at the same time, it creates a stop loss offer that says at 150 liquidators can liquidate my position and give me back the 150 I need to reset. Sorry, I'm sorry for this. Of course, the demo. So you provide again 200 die, 150 graph guarantee. And so that's it. You have 200 diet left. And so you have now provided liquidity to the die.
00:24:48.114 - 00:25:11.830, Speaker A: I've refilled the stuff. So now you can see the stop loss you've done. So here, the one we just created is here. So we put 200 die in. We said that we want 150 guarantee, and the current value is 190. The health factor is more than one. And as soon as it gets under one, you will be liquidated.
00:25:11.830 - 00:25:44.360, Speaker A: It is when your current value is close to 150. And in this case here, you can see that I've prefilled some orders and two are at risk. So this one, you provided 104 die. The guarantee is 100 die, but the current value is 103. So this is at risk. And so a liquidator can liquidate your position. So now let's see what happens if a liquidator actually does it.
00:25:44.360 - 00:26:06.718, Speaker A: So he goes to the liquidate section. Of course it's going to be bought later. But for now, I've built this UI so that people can liquidate. So here you can see how we find the stop loss that we see. So as a liquidator, now I'm going to liquidate that. I have the right to do it because the health factor is negative is less than one. So I'm going to liquidate that.
00:26:06.718 - 00:26:31.670, Speaker A: Hopefully I don't have to set my account back. Yes, it seemed to work. So now huh, okay, I can't see that. But let's get back to the oh, yes. Now it's this. So it has been liquidated. And so now the liquidator, he managed to liquidate the position.
00:26:31.670 - 00:27:18.098, Speaker A: So he gave back to the stop loss orderer the amount that he wanted, and he received the fees. That was the extra amount because he liquidated just before it went to 100 die. Now, if we get back to the initial user so now you can see that, oh, my die has been here. You can see that in the closed stop loss offers, one has been executed. And you can see that the amount that has been reroll is exactly what you were guaranteed. Yes. And you can see now the die, it's 215, and before it was 115.
00:27:18.098 - 00:27:53.134, Speaker A: So that's how it works. It's basically you provide liquidity. You don't know a lot about impermanent loss, but you provide with one currency, and you guarantee with the same currency, and at the end you get the let's say this one can say, okay, now I want my liquidity back. I want the data back anyway. So I think that's it. So, yeah, now you can sell it. So we see it as a protocol that would be more used maybe by other smart contracts or by I don't know.
00:27:53.134 - 00:28:12.950, Speaker A: But yeah, it really is a protocol more than an app. It's protocol that ensures that you have liquidator that liquidate your position when you want it. I think that's it for yeah. Let's move into questions if anybody has some feedback.
00:28:14.490 - 00:28:24.806, Speaker B: Yeah, that would have been my first question. What are the fees and how are all of these things covered? So transaction fees, do you pay these liquidators? What's that dynamic?
00:28:24.998 - 00:29:00.200, Speaker A: Okay, so the dynamic is that here so here I have let's look at this order. The current value is almost two, and the guarantee that I set is and so the extra amount will be used to pay for liquidators. So basically, you incentivize them to liquidate your position because it's profitable for them. And at the same time, he has to pay the gas to make the transaction and gets back this value.
00:29:00.970 - 00:29:06.214, Speaker B: Got it. So they pay for the gas out of the money that comes from what they make. Okay.
00:29:06.252 - 00:29:13.218, Speaker A: Yeah. We liquidate them just a bit before they are in danger so that we can pay for the liquidators.
00:29:13.394 - 00:29:15.080, Speaker B: Got it. Okay.
00:29:16.250 - 00:29:54.760, Speaker A: Future thought might be like it'd be really interesting if you could figure out a way for people to insure the liquidity positions where it's like you almost have this default swap where others can bet that you'll never need to liquidate. It's almost like hedging this position. I don't know, it's a dumb idea, but I was just thinking really large positions and maybe you have these stop losses, but you ideally don't want them to really kick in. It's not in your favor. Maybe others are willing to bet on that. Right. So just an idea.
00:29:54.760 - 00:29:56.680, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:29:58.730 - 00:30:35.730, Speaker C: Yeah. To me it feels a little more like a feature than, like, a standalone product. Like, it might make sense inside of a bigger interface, but that being said, I feel like it's a pretty novel feature and also just kind of solving the stop loss problem. How do you ensure that the stop loss is filled at a reasonable time or at a price that's okay for the customer or for the user?
00:30:36.390 - 00:31:22.180, Speaker A: So it's exactly like the business model of Maker or Ave that okay, you don't want it to be executed, but it's a worst case scenario. It's when you are at risk and in this case, you pay fees so that a liquidator does it for you. So really is a guarantee. Let's say that the price, like, yeah, it's in the night and there is a very large impermanent loss and you're not here, you're going to be liquidated. You have this guarantee. And what is great with that is that you can give back an NFT to the person that has this position that will be always worth more than the amount. There's a lot of things we could beat around that.
00:31:23.110 - 00:31:52.410, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. Makerdow sort of learned the hard way that these systems can be complicated for these liquidation auctions. What would you say the advantage of what you're doing is? Is there anything about the way you're doing it in your system that's a bit simpler or safer than what is currently kind of being built into all of the protocols that have to manage collateral?
00:31:52.850 - 00:32:46.400, Speaker A: Yeah, so actually it's really simple is that I builded the subgraph that does it and for building a bot that liquidates and that makes Arbitrage basically it's super simple to do it. And it's just like people will make money if they liquidate. So I don't see a world when they wouldn't do it. If you see how much the Arbitrage are hard to get in right now, if I say, okay, you can liquidate and you can earn free money pretty easily with a really simple API, because you just have to follow the health structure and liquidate when you can cool. The liquidator should be making money. So I think that we could find something.
00:32:47.250 - 00:32:49.440, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it makes sense. Nice.
00:32:52.530 - 00:32:52.942, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:52.996 - 00:32:55.120, Speaker B: Well done. Good work.
00:32:56.870 - 00:33:00.820, Speaker A: Thank you guys for the feedback. I'm going to stop.
00:33:01.910 - 00:33:02.610, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:33:02.680 - 00:33:30.380, Speaker A: All right, so thank you for presenting. We are still waiting for Austin to join, but we're going to just bite the bullet and split into rooms because I want to make sure we get as many people as possible to go through. So Simona and Peter, I'm going to throw you in the other room and then just start pushing people that way if you're good with that. Scott, you're going to stay in here with me and Austin when he joins. All right, cool. Let's try to get 20 pay. Hopefully you resolve your issues.
00:33:30.380 - 00:33:42.640, Speaker A: Hey, guys, can you hear me? Yes. Okay, cool. Yeah. Let me see if this works. Share. Perfect. See that? Yes.
00:33:42.640 - 00:34:30.298, Speaker A: Cool. Okay. Yeah. So 20 pay. Basically what we're trying to do is create a little widget that goes in an ecommerce store and when you want to pay for something so you see, this is Kyber network store, and it says you can pay with KNC, OGN, dai, ETH, or credit card. What we want to do is make it so that you can pay with literally any ERC 20 that is tradable on uniswap, one inch, et cetera. So basically, you go in a store like this, say you want to buy a shirt, you add cart checkout, go to the checkout page, it's right here, and you have four options KNC, Dai, ETH, OGN.
00:34:30.298 - 00:35:17.600, Speaker A: And what we're going to do is throw our little widget right into here and you're going to have the ability to pay with hundreds of ERC, 20 tokens just like that. And the way it's going to work is we are literally going to call uniswap one inch on the back end. Right now we're using uniswap, call uniswap on the back end and do a token transfer for you into the token that the merchant has requested and up to the amount that the merchant has requested. So we're still putting things together. This is a little bit difficult, but here's our little widget that we're going to throw in. We're going to change the look of this. This is kind of what we're playing around with on the front end, but basically you're going to be able to drop down into what you want to pay with.
00:35:17.600 - 00:35:40.120, Speaker A: It'll give you something like you need to add up to one ETH, and then it will do the uniswap trade on the back end for you. And so we have a lot of the smart contracts done and whatnot. We're just actually putting them together in the next few days here. So that's as far as I'll take the demo safely, but that's basically the idea.
00:35:43.910 - 00:35:44.660, Speaker F: Cool.
00:35:47.990 - 00:35:53.320, Speaker C: Yeah. So what part of this is what already exists and what part is your project?
00:35:56.650 - 00:36:10.220, Speaker A: Yeah, we're literally just building the widget and we're also going to build a demo ecommerce store that's going to look like this, but it's obviously not going to be functional except for demo purposes. And so what we're building.
00:36:12.030 - 00:36:21.760, Speaker C: I guess the thing I'm trying to figure out is me paying with Dai, is that your project or that currently exists and. You're just doing the switch from Dai to something else.
00:36:22.770 - 00:36:43.110, Speaker A: So you paying with those four currencies here on Kyber. This currently exists. This is their ecommerce store. So you can do that. And then what we want to do is make it so that you can pay with the 200 or 300 other ERC, 20 tokens that you can swap on Uniswap.
00:36:45.290 - 00:37:49.210, Speaker C: Okay, cool. Yeah. I think there's a bit of a problem right now for merch stores because if you accept the projects token, you probably have to sell that into the market and then it seems like anti community but then if you pay in something else, you're not using the token for the project. So it's weird but definitely like you pay in Dai and then I will market by whatever the project token is, is kind of like better for memes. So if I'm trying to growth hack my store and I'm like, hey, I'm accepting dye but I market sell that to buy based. So you can buy my based money shirts or whatever, right? That meme is going to spread better on social media because everyone that has those bags will want to spread it. So I think that's actually kind of like a cool little hook that's not currently available to people that want to sell crypto project related stuff.
00:37:49.210 - 00:37:52.490, Speaker C: Who do you see as like your core user?
00:37:54.030 - 00:38:14.180, Speaker A: So the core user is just going to be any sort of random ecommerce store that is trying to get up and running or trying to get a little bit of traction or get people excited. And then we'll make it so that people that want to buy stuff there are able to use literally whatever's in their MetaMask account and it's going to.
00:38:17.190 - 00:39:10.942, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know how far you plan on pursuing this after the hackathon, but I think there's currently like a missing spot in the market where I can go on figma, toss together some designs or whatever Adobe or whatever I'm using and then I can do drop shipping really easily. But this sort of widget can kind of fill that missing link because I want the payment to be in my currency. And for newly launched coins, whether they're fair launches or farms or whatever, letting community, that's sort of like a good first project for community members. And if you created this kind of SDK but entrepreneurial kit and your widget was part of it, it might actually, I don't know, I think there might be people like projects would direct their users to use your thing to do the merch stores.
00:39:11.086 - 00:39:28.714, Speaker A: Yeah, that's cool idea. So basically what you're saying is you want to spin up a store like you can drop ship super easily. Let's also have you make a token super easily, give it out to your early adopter users and then they can pay with that token immediately in your store. Okay.
00:39:28.752 - 00:40:13.970, Speaker C: Like when wifey launched, right, I was sort of like playing around. I'd be fun to toss up a really quick wifey merch store like sell wifey shirts or hats or whatever. And what you really want to be able to tell people is that you pay me in stablecoins but I'm actually going to stack wifey when you buy the shirts. So it's like you're buying the shirts and stablecoins helps me accumulate wifey and buys wifey on the market. So it's like for the community, the more shirts that store sells, that's all wifey being bought on the market. So it's like a very monetarily insignificant amount in the grand scheme of things. But it's like a fun thing to share.
00:40:13.970 - 00:40:26.490, Speaker C: So it's a good growth hack for both early communities and the person that launches selling the shirts and sort of by extension your widget.
00:40:26.930 - 00:40:33.534, Speaker A: Right, yeah, I could see something like that for sure. Yeah.
00:40:33.572 - 00:40:45.646, Speaker C: I might focus in on one very narrow core first user and kind of build the experience around their needs rather than just kind of like for everyone. Yeah, just for bootstrapping.
00:40:45.758 - 00:40:51.300, Speaker A: I think that's a really good idea. It's going to be hard to penetrate the market if you don't have a specific place to focus.
00:40:52.490 - 00:41:09.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I've definitely wanted something like this in discussions with early communities because it is like a problem because if you buy in the token bitcoin community is like I don't want to pay in bitcoin because that bitcoin just gets sold.
00:41:09.574 - 00:41:11.020, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:41:11.790 - 00:41:20.154, Speaker C: And so this sort of solves that problem in a pro social, pro share way. It's kind of neat. I don't know.
00:41:20.352 - 00:41:21.146, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:41:21.328 - 00:41:47.638, Speaker G: I think I've already chimed in on this too and I think mine was all about making it really easy for the developer to integrate. Right. It's just like NPM install whatever it is and it just works out of the box. This cool little trick of on the way through you can swap it to different tokens and kind of I just caught the back half of that conversation. But how kind of on the way through you can swap that for different tokens and how that can have some meme value to it in terms of what you're stacking on the other side.
00:41:47.724 - 00:41:48.966, Speaker A: That's fine. Yeah.
00:41:49.148 - 00:42:13.120, Speaker C: And once any product becomes known as the easy thing to recommend in a niche market, it'll just sort of be included in docs or be included in the conventional wisdom and then you can kind of get a toe hold that you can build from.
00:42:13.730 - 00:42:21.070, Speaker A: Right. Because this isn't like the sexiest thing to market around. So I think you're right, that is kind of the way we have to get the toe hold.
00:42:21.220 - 00:42:32.710, Speaker C: Yeah. No competitor or you will be able to afford an advertising campaign to get this out there. Right, so it's like once there's a standard, it sort of just sticks until the standard messes up.
00:42:32.860 - 00:42:40.070, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Cool.
00:42:40.220 - 00:42:41.558, Speaker C: Yeah, it's cool.
00:42:41.724 - 00:42:53.370, Speaker A: Yeah. No, thank you guys for the feedback. That's a really cool idea. I don't think we had thought of that. So I'm going to think a lot more about that and think about where we want to target early users.
00:42:54.350 - 00:42:57.114, Speaker C: Okay, thanks, man. Well, good luck.
00:42:57.242 - 00:43:08.080, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks so much. Appreciate it, guys. Thanks, Jack. Moving right along, we're going to see if Machu Picchu is ready and if they.
00:43:10.070 - 00:43:11.140, Speaker H: Let me share.
00:43:13.430 - 00:43:29.650, Speaker A: Perfect. You are muted if you intend to be muted.
00:43:31.190 - 00:43:32.338, Speaker H: Yeah, hello?
00:43:32.504 - 00:43:33.940, Speaker A: Yes, go ahead.
00:43:37.030 - 00:44:23.186, Speaker H: We were on the idea validation round. Also we are creating a platform for farmers for risk sharing, if you guys remember. So we had three different roles, farmers, enablers and watchers in which farmers will go to enablers and deposit their rupees to them for the compensation. And the enablers will provide the mattress and mint tokens for them and that will be used when the farmers have their crop loss and all those things that will be used to compensate them at the last. So I will go through the flow first and then I'll show you the demo. So first of all, there will be farmers. They will have only fiat currency, but they will have no computer, no blockchain knowledge to use.
00:44:23.186 - 00:45:15.314, Speaker H: They will go to enabler. Enabler will be person who will be identified using Blue so that it's like head of the village or some people will be identified and farmers will get their money to them. Then enabler will use portis or any other service to generate wallet for the farmers, basically addresses all those things. And after that, enabler will send a request to our DAP with the new address and the mobile number and the amount to register this particular farmer to the system. Now, this particular system will send an OTP to farmer's mobile in which farmer can see like, yeah, the amount that is going to be minted is correct and the address is there or not. So all this thing will be in the OTP message and farmers can verify that because they don't have knowledge for blockchain. So they can't use the platform directly, but they can have OTP service, messaging service to see all these things.
00:45:15.314 - 00:45:58.138, Speaker H: Once farmers get the message, they will have the option to check whether the amount is correct or not, details are correct or not. And if it is not, then they can just like they won't proceed from there. And if it is correct, they will get their op back to the enabler and enabler will use that to generate the token. Now, all the tokens from all the farmers will be deposited in a pot. So this pot is like a global pot. And from this pot we are trying to create a money market kind of thing. Like this pot will be deposited on compound or away and kind of thing, right? And from there, watchers can swap or borrow tokens using it or some other cryptocurrency so that they can have tokens.
00:45:58.138 - 00:46:36.198, Speaker H: So watchers are the people all over the world who will use the satellite data to assess the crops of the farmers who have deposited in the pot, right? Okay. And before Waters do the assessment, they have to do staking. And for that, they will not need tokens. So they will take the tokens from any swap or some avia compound and they will do the assessment after doing the staking part. So again, the stake will come in our DAP and the assessment will be done by the watchers. And after a certain period of time, let's say one month, a final calculation will be done. Based upon that, farmers will be compensated their money and watchers will be given back the stake.
00:46:36.198 - 00:47:08.934, Speaker H: But if they are not close to the result, some stake will be cut. If they are very close to the stake, they will be rewarded some point. So in this way, watchers will earn and farmers will also be compensated if they have a crop loss. So this is the basic idea and the basic flow. Right now we have developed like 80% of it, but we have some sponsors to integrate to it. So this is the first page and it has two options to choose the wallet from what is for MetaMask. Let's say I go with MetaMask in this case.
00:47:09.132 - 00:47:09.638, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:09.724 - 00:47:19.942, Speaker H: So this is the account of a member. We can see here. Like this member has deposited 80 rup. Tokens out of 100 is the total pod contribution.
00:47:20.006 - 00:47:20.378, Speaker A: Right?
00:47:20.464 - 00:47:35.630, Speaker H: Now, if this member wants to contribute more, he will just go here. Let's say he add 20. Now, when he's adding 20, he's actually giving RS20 to the enabler that is present in his village. And this enabler will click this button, proceed and send OTP.
00:47:36.710 - 00:47:37.122, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:37.176 - 00:47:52.022, Speaker H: Now, this OTP will be sent to the farmer's registered mobile number so that farmer can verify, like, yes, RS20 are being minted for him and that is being deposited to the deposit pot for his account.
00:47:52.076 - 00:47:52.438, Speaker B: Right?
00:47:52.524 - 00:48:30.580, Speaker H: So now we can see a timer kind of thing, right? So within three minutes, farmer will get an OTP. So this OTP is basically a random number that we are getting using the chainlink VRF. And I have created an external adapter that uses some message service. And from the on chain data, on chain OTP is sent to farmers mobile. And from that mobile, when we enter this OTP here, it will again be sent to our smart contract to verify. So in our smart contract, we have stored the hash of the OTP and OTP that will be entered there, they will be matched. If they matches, then yes, like the farmer has authorized the transaction, kind of.
00:48:30.580 - 00:49:13.534, Speaker H: So I have got the OTP now in my mobile and when I click on verify and contribute after this transaction is completed. Now this particular farmer has contributed 20 more rup tokens to the pot. Similarly, we have water roles and enabler roles. Waters will have the option to stake and do the assessment for the group. So we can see like 120 is the total bottom on now and 100 is a contribution of this particular farmer. Similarly, we can switch between different accounts to showcase to that. But I signed with my permits and our flow is very big, so I'll stop here.
00:49:13.534 - 00:49:25.778, Speaker H: I think this gives a big demo of what we are trying to build and what we have built till now. So we are open for questions now until you guys want to go further. Also, I can go for that.
00:49:25.864 - 00:49:26.500, Speaker A: Also.
00:49:29.910 - 00:49:31.846, Speaker G: There'S a ton going on that you want to go.
00:49:31.868 - 00:49:32.534, Speaker A: Scott, you go.
00:49:32.572 - 00:49:51.690, Speaker C: You go if you no go. Austin, go. Wait, I was just going to really quick add that you made a ton of progress. I remember from the previous call we talked about this and I'm just impressed how much the ideas crystallized since that call. But it's pretty cool. But yeah, go ahead. Austin.
00:49:54.590 - 00:50:27.734, Speaker G: You've got a lot going on here, right? There's a lot of different systems at play. You've got chain link, you've got swaps happening. You have that one time password mechanic. And I think I say this to a lot of people that have these big ambitious projects. First of all, it's awesome, right? It's great to be experimenting with all of these systems, but there's almost always going to be something you find along the way. Like that one time password thing that isn't standardized within the space yet, right? Maybe there's not a system just to do that one time password thing. Maybe there totally is too.
00:50:27.734 - 00:51:10.274, Speaker G: I don't really know that much about it in particular, but that alone could be a really good hackathon project, right? Just being able to set up a system like that. Regardless of that, let's go to the human part of this. And I think that's what's the key piece here is. You're doing a lot of onboarding and you're interfacing with a lot of humans and a lot of humans have to understand these systems. And so I think that the best first start. Not on the hackathon side, obviously building it, but getting it in people's hands and seeing how they use it. Just trying it with some of your friends and trying that onboarding process with them, you might find some things along the way that can really inform how you build the thing.
00:51:10.274 - 00:51:27.020, Speaker G: So I don't know if that's not necessarily like hackathon hackathon advice, but more like I've been through a lot of hackathons building a lot of these things, and I learned so much just by having a couple of other people try it out and go through it. And I would do that with that onboarding process that you have set up.
00:51:27.710 - 00:51:30.890, Speaker C: Yeah, real quick, can you go back to the flow?
00:51:32.190 - 00:51:32.940, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:51:35.310 - 00:51:44.846, Speaker C: Also, Austin, I mean, we're kind of in a hackathon. I'm not sure what sort of prizes we're trying to get. So sometimes there can be an incentive for a slightly more complicated checking off the list.
00:51:44.948 - 00:51:47.630, Speaker G: Yeah, checking off some names.
00:51:48.450 - 00:51:48.766, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:48.788 - 00:52:14.220, Speaker C: But if we're going to take this to market, everything that's not on the screen right now in that upper right hand corner, that can just go away. I think we all can agree on that because I think whether this works or not is not going to be dependent on whether we're getting a little interest or doing some swaps. It's going to be dependent on whether farmers want this insurance, whether they trust this system or not.
00:52:15.950 - 00:52:39.746, Speaker G: And you almost start with farmers, right. You may find a similar subset of humans that wish to participate in this that aren't necessarily farmers. That may be easier to onboard at first, right. Maybe it's like kids at an arcade or something. I don't know exactly what it is, but you can pick out some other subset that might be easier to get on board also.
00:52:39.928 - 00:52:40.914, Speaker C: Well, he has it.
00:52:40.952 - 00:52:43.618, Speaker G: I love Farmer. He does have it set up.
00:52:43.704 - 00:52:46.386, Speaker C: Enabler. No, there's this like enabler system.
00:52:46.488 - 00:52:47.630, Speaker G: The local enabler.
00:52:47.710 - 00:52:48.098, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:48.184 - 00:52:54.866, Speaker C: They just keep their piece of paper and the guy at the local shop kind of does it for the enabler.
00:52:54.898 - 00:52:56.390, Speaker G: Is the one on the ground.
00:52:56.970 - 00:54:17.460, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like someone you trust from town, essentially, but post hackathon, strip out everything except for what you really need. If you want to really pursue this and just go try it and see if anyone actually wants to buy it or hold a giveaway in the first season where you just give away the insurance to some subset of farmers. If you can find someone to back you and they buy the insurance and give it away and just see if the simple version works. Because, you'll know, whether people care about this or they don't care about it, if you offer it to them and you hear what they really say and if people are saying they actually want this and you can make sales on a very simple something that you're proud you did it but you're not really proud of how well it works type of product that can be validation to take this bigger because it is like a big market you're addressing. But you really have to get that answer. Does this system appeal to your core stakeholders that you need to care about this? You know?
00:54:17.830 - 00:54:50.540, Speaker H: Yeah. So next thing that we are targeting right now is to find out a system to identify enabler for that. We are looking into Bloom right now, but we have to integrate it yet. And one more thing was regarding the reputation of the watchers. I think Scott suggested us to look into Case beauty contest, right. So one of our team member looked into it and got an idea from that regarding the reputation, token and all.
00:54:54.930 - 00:54:57.230, Speaker A: I think that was Scott suggested that, right?
00:54:57.380 - 00:54:58.080, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:55:02.530 - 00:55:16.740, Speaker C: Just go to market. Go to market and see if people care. If people care, it could be a really big thing.
00:55:19.210 - 00:55:48.558, Speaker G: Yeah, but also the simplification there, I think that my last piece of advice is it's like, way too complicated. And I would be looking at one simple mechanism or one simple loop, and I would want to try that loop, put it in people's hands and see how they use it. And really, you can't do that during a hackathon. I get that. But maybe your friends maybe you just have a fake round where you guys just pretend like you're doing it and you go through it. You'll notice a lot of things while using it.
00:55:48.724 - 00:55:51.258, Speaker H: Yeah. Doing a testing.
00:55:51.434 - 00:55:59.060, Speaker A: Thank you. Awesome. Thank you. Coldeep. Good to see some progress on this from last week.
00:56:00.230 - 00:56:02.078, Speaker H: Thank you. Let me stop sharing.
00:56:02.174 - 00:56:11.240, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. All right, next up we have DB. Are you guys still around? Yeah. Hi.
00:56:12.250 - 00:56:57.330, Speaker F: We are Team DBITS. So basically what DBITS is, it's a decentralized platform for independent artists through which they can incentivize. So how we are making this possible is there is a substance based pattern. So whenever a person has to listen to the artist's music or his albums, he has to pay a basic subscription fee. Through that fee, they will be enabled to listen his tracks. And that fee is completely reversible. Like, if he wants to unsubscribe, he will get back full amount.
00:56:57.330 - 00:57:14.406, Speaker F: Like, there is no deduction and even the gas cost will be paid through our system. So he just has to pay for that fee. And what this will initiate for the artist is basically whatever, the fees will be collected.
00:57:14.518 - 00:57:15.350, Speaker A: Smart contract.
00:57:15.430 - 00:57:45.842, Speaker F: Those will be posted into compound, and over the period, whatever, the interest will be gained that will be distributed to the artists. So it's a win win situation for both the artists as well as the subscribers, and then we can build things on top of this platform. So I would like my teammate to show us a demo. Hello, I'm Vinay. I'm a member of this team. Can I share my screen?
00:57:45.976 - 00:57:46.660, Speaker A: Yes.
00:57:48.890 - 00:58:03.622, Speaker F: Okay, so I would like to show you the overall flow of our app. And then I would like to do a demo, which till now we have created. Okay, can you see my screen? The draw IO?
00:58:03.686 - 00:58:04.794, Speaker G: Yes, we got it.
00:58:04.912 - 00:58:48.566, Speaker F: Okay, so the technologies we used are Portis, Audience, audience, Compound, textual, and matic. Okay, so I want to start by asking a question. Do you all know about Audience, what it is? It's a music streaming platform. Okay. Everyone can go on their platform and listen to some music on which everyone can be a creator. Okay? If you are a creator, you can create your music, then you can upload on their platform, and everyone else can listen to your music. But there is no way to get into the blockchain bit in that part.
00:58:48.566 - 01:00:06.426, Speaker F: So what we think is of this subscription based decentralized system in which the subscribers can subscribe to the artist which they like the most. And then the money they have subscribed we have now just used a sort of like this is our app and there are so many trending tags, okay? Here. So if someone clicks on an app and he starts to listen but he cannot listen after 10 seconds we have given a restraint on that system. And when he clicks on subscribe some staking money he will stake some zero point 25 ether in this demo to the contract address and then that money will go to the contract and then it will go to a compound API which will in case supply it to the C ETH tokens on which we will get almost 3% overall interest rate. Okay? And then once he has subscribed it, then you can see all the artist tracks.
01:00:06.458 - 01:00:06.750, Speaker H: Okay?
01:00:06.820 - 01:01:03.534, Speaker F: He has just played his one song and he subscribed to the artist. But we can now listen to all of the songs and we can listen it freely. Okay? Now he doesn't have to wait for ten second reload and all he can just skip to any part and listen the full song. Okay? And then what is the next part is like, if he tries to he has subscribed for a month or a two month period and then he likes to get his money back or he has bored or he just needs to just take his money and subscribe to some other artist. Then he can do it easily by clicking this unsubscribe button which will sorry, the API just failed. Which will in case call the Biconomy API which will call the Biconomy API. And that way our transaction would be gasless.
01:01:03.534 - 01:01:44.560, Speaker F: Okay? Like here are all the Bi economy APIs we have set up which are supply to compound, redeem the seed and send that ether to the subscriber itself. So basically what we want is we don't want the end users to pay the gas fees. They just want to stake the amount and that incentive will be earned by the music creators. Okay? And this is a stable stream through which the music creators can earn rather than some tokens or anything. Yeah, see now I've unsubscribed it, okay. And then it will send a request to the Biconomy API which I don't know why it declines every time. Every time.
01:01:44.560 - 01:02:19.702, Speaker F: Wait a minute. Actually this is just work in progress. We are going to see this issue why it is going on. The Biconomy API setup was just done in the last so this is our work till now. Yeah. And there is like a second option. If you're not a long term support of that artist, if you just like that artist and you listen to his songs so much time then you can just give him a one time donation.
01:02:19.702 - 01:02:43.780, Speaker F: Okay? And that can be done through portis. And then the artist will get his money and then the artist will get a big amount of incentives. Okay. He doesn't have to wait a long term for the interest to go back to his account and then he can just start creating his own content more and more often till now. This is our demo.
01:02:45.670 - 01:02:46.130, Speaker A: Awesome.
01:02:46.200 - 01:03:02.166, Speaker G: This is a cool project. This is a good use of APIs. You do a good job of not reinventing the wheel. These guys can do metatransactions for us. These guys can handle the music stuff. I want to kind of dig into how you're handling the music stuff. I'm guessing it's just like an audience API.
01:03:02.278 - 01:03:05.834, Speaker A: It's not like you're putting songs on IPFS and stuff.
01:03:05.872 - 01:03:19.982, Speaker G: Right? They're handling that. Okay, so you as the app builder have to pay some subscription to Audius for the API and then that gives you the ability to have a service that plays songs. Is that how it works?
01:03:20.116 - 01:03:25.214, Speaker F: No, actually it's completely free to get their songs and everything.
01:03:25.412 - 01:03:28.734, Speaker G: Awesome. So it's like kind of like a free spotify API?
01:03:28.782 - 01:03:30.020, Speaker A: In a way, yeah.
01:03:30.630 - 01:03:41.240, Speaker F: Now I have unsubscribed from this and it has run down successfully. Okay. Now you can see like, I have 14.9 and suddenly increased like zero point 25.
01:03:43.610 - 01:03:45.990, Speaker G: So how are you guys doing the subscriptions?
01:03:47.130 - 01:04:37.654, Speaker F: Okay, for now, when the artist is subscribing, the whole money goes to a contract address. Okay. In the contract address, all the calculations, like supplying the ether to the compound address as a whole and then getting the interest and then redeeming the ether and then sending it back to the subscriber who paid it. So it's like a no profit, no loss for the user to listen to the artist. Okay, so when we subscribe, then the supply to it compound calls and then it checks whether the contract address has enough balance in it and then it supplies to the compound. Here you can see this is last time when I checked. And now the ETH tokens are increased in the address.
01:04:37.654 - 01:04:55.230, Speaker F: This is the compound ether read contract from where we can fetch basically, by building on top of this, we have managed to get a sweet spot out of everything through which there is a win situation for both the parties.
01:04:56.450 - 01:04:57.134, Speaker A: Say that again.
01:04:57.172 - 01:04:58.910, Speaker G: Sorry, I missed that last little part.
01:04:59.060 - 01:04:59.422, Speaker H: Yeah.
01:04:59.476 - 01:05:13.822, Speaker F: So basically by building on top of these, we have got a sweet spot, like basically a small incentive and that creates a win win situation for both the parties, the artists as well as the subscribers.
01:05:13.966 - 01:05:14.274, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:14.312 - 01:05:34.220, Speaker G: And the instant artist onboarding is a great like with Nifty Inc. That was one thing that we really wanted to focus on, is when an artist gets in, it's free for them. They don't even have to know about blockchain. They can just get in and kind of do their thing. Right. And then on the other side, the subscriber side, that's the guy who pays and has to put in the money and understand the wallet and stuff like that.
01:05:36.030 - 01:05:53.360, Speaker F: And also we are planning further, if we are able to complete it till the end of Hackathon to make the subscriber convert there on our site through one inch APIs or something.
01:05:54.130 - 01:05:55.966, Speaker G: How does the security work?
01:05:56.148 - 01:05:57.700, Speaker F: Whichever will keep security.
01:05:58.710 - 01:06:05.022, Speaker G: How do you detect, like, they've already only watched 15 seconds. That's definitely not in a smart contract.
01:06:05.086 - 01:06:21.894, Speaker F: That's definitely something in the front end. Yeah. The users who have not subscribed to anyone will just like there are free songs, okay? Anyone who will listen to free songs can only listen up to 10 seconds. He need to subscribe to those songs which he likes the most.
01:06:21.932 - 01:06:22.134, Speaker A: Okay?
01:06:22.172 - 01:06:57.454, Speaker F: Like, he's getting a demo, like how the songs is going to be in the starting 10 seconds. Okay? And then if he likes that song, he can subscribe to it, and when he subscribes, then he can listen the whole song for that. We have used Matic contracts to do these fast transactions, okay? Like, when we subscribe now, the whole bunch of artist IDs goes into the arrays of the contract matic contract, because it is a layer two solution. It is much, much cheap and also much faster than the Ringbee Ethereum network.
01:06:57.582 - 01:07:00.740, Speaker G: That's why you awesome.
01:07:02.310 - 01:07:09.254, Speaker A: This looks great, guys. Scott, do you have anything otherwise, I think we should try to get in a few more teams before yeah, no.
01:07:09.292 - 01:07:12.040, Speaker C: I like Dawson's feedback. It seems like a cool.
01:07:14.010 - 01:07:16.614, Speaker F: Yeah, yeah, sure. Thank you.
01:07:16.652 - 01:07:27.840, Speaker A: Keep building. Yeah. All right, we're going to try to fit in these last three teams here in the time we have. So Blockchain ARPG, do you guys want to try to present?
01:07:28.930 - 01:07:34.190, Speaker D: Yeah. Hey, guys. My name is Alfred Schecker. Can you all hear me?
01:07:34.340 - 01:07:35.040, Speaker A: Yes.
01:07:35.910 - 01:08:14.960, Speaker D: So I'm working with my partner, Zachary Law on Blockchain ARPG. Unfortunately, Zachary couldn't be here today. He's driving, I think, from work. So basically I'm going to show a demo of our game so far and then talk about it and talk about what we're doing in terms of the Blockchain stuff and yeah, we'll see how that goes. So I'm going to go ahead and share my Unity page and then I'll show you the program running also on WebGL, so you guys can see my screen.
01:08:16.530 - 01:08:17.182, Speaker A: Yes.
01:08:17.316 - 01:09:14.314, Speaker D: All right. So essentially for our project, we were inspired by stani's idea from Avi in creating the concept of an interest bearing, esports competitive tournament. Essentially, the idea that we have is we wanted to create a kind of competitive game where players don't fight directly with each other, but they kind of compete in the goal, and the person who achieves that goal gets the prize. So essentially what we came up with here is a bit of a mix of a Diablo style game with Call of Duty Zombies, where the point of the game is to survive as long as you can in an area and kind of use your power ups, whatever you have, to defeat as many zombies as. You can get to the furthest level and then whoever does would be the winner. So I'm just going to quickly show a demo of what we have so far of the game itself. And then we're going to talk about the blockchain aspects.
01:09:14.314 - 01:09:33.800, Speaker D: So it's going to hit play here. We're going to see we have my player character here. We kind of have like this isometric view. If you've played Diablos, should be a bit familiar. We have one of the zombies here kind of shambling towards us. If you hit C here, we have a character sheet and I brings up an inventory. So I'm going to go ahead and start swinging at him.
01:09:33.800 - 01:09:56.614, Speaker D: You can see him kind of like reel back a bit. If I want to back up here, I can shoot fireball towards him. So eventually he's going to die. So he's dead and he has dropped an item here. So if I go up here and pick up this item, you can see it popped in my inventory. I got some chain mail. If you were paying attention, the armor here went up a little bit and so did the HP.
01:09:56.614 - 01:10:35.610, Speaker D: So basically you pick up an item, it affects your character stats. And of course the character stats affect how fast you die, how much you can hit and all that stuff. Obviously, if you play any kind of video game, this should be familiar. And if you want to drop the item, you can just hit drop. The armor goes back from 14 to ten, health back from one to five to 100. So it's kind of the idea that you'd go around, you'd kill these enemies, they would randomly drop loot, and you would get this loot to empower you and mix and match what you want based on what kind of build you want. If you want to focus more on your magic spells or your attacks, obviously these are just like the first steps that we have for making something like this.
01:10:35.610 - 01:11:31.018, Speaker D: And the enemy, of course, is very basic, just like, chases you down and slaps you a bunch and does damage to you. So we're going to go ahead and if I can get this, why is this share screen UI in my way? So we're going to get this out of the way here. So essentially what the idea is, what this is, is that you go through and we also have a quick little level I can show you. It's not fully finished, but this is another example of what kind of aesthetic we're going for. So this kind of these kind of visuals here, this is a level made by my partner, Zach. So this is just kind of an idea of what we're going for. We still have things to tweak, obviously, as you can see here, like, the edge of the level is showing with the camera angle and certain things like that, but you can still fire attack.
01:11:31.018 - 01:12:00.850, Speaker D: There's enemies here somewhere. Yes, here you go. Here's one of the enemies. Same deal, just kind of beat them up and they dropped their items. Dropped items. And we can see in the character sheet here, staff, all that stuff. So the concept with this game, the idea is that we want to have the players compete with each other and go through these dungeons that have these enemies and there'll be different types of enemies.
01:12:00.850 - 01:13:28.058, Speaker D: And the idea is that at the beginning of the week, so we want to use Avi in a way that at the beginning of the tournament cycle, they stake money, they would stake and the funds would be pulled into an Avi liquidity pool to gain interest throughout the duration of the tournament. And then at the end of it, whoever wins, whoever has the best time, furthest level, whatever, we decide on being the ultimate winning condition. Whoever wins that is the person who gets to take all the interest and then everybody else kind of takes back what they staked so nobody really loses. You just kind of like play to try and gain over what you staked. And then another thing that we want to implement too, or that we are working on, currently implementing, is certain enemies will drop based on they will drop the loot box based NFT. Like they will drop like a kind of NFT that will give you a special ability or a special item that will greatly increase your chances of winning. And this is triggered using the chain link alarm clock to trigger the randomness for these loot boxes to show up so that we can guarantee that they're random and they're not somehow deterministic or they're rigged somehow or whatever, right? So essentially these loot boxes would show up out of boss enemies.
01:13:28.058 - 01:14:07.374, Speaker D: They would be like legendary drops. If you've ever played like World of Warcraft or some other video game like RPG like that, you get that one legendary drop that only comes around if you're super lucky. And then that item is the NFT and it's a big deal because it gives you a big boost. That's kind of like the idea that we're going with here. It's just kind of have these zombie style diablo game. See where we can go with that and take these blockchain concepts further. This is our first blockchain hackathon and first time working with smart contracts and stuff like that.
01:14:07.374 - 01:14:39.238, Speaker D: So we're definitely excited to be getting into this kind of technology. But I understand if we're thinking too much or if we guys have any feedback towards what we're thinking of. This is kind of like our first time tackling something like this. I've made games for a while and so is Zach, but we have experience in the game making department. It's just the blockchain stuff that's kind of brand new to us. So any feedback would be much appreciated. And if any questions you guys have, if I explain something weird or something.
01:14:39.238 - 01:14:40.886, Speaker D: I'm just kind of trying to wrap my head around.
01:14:40.988 - 01:15:46.160, Speaker C: No, no. Personally I have some feedback for you. I think. So in general, at least in the States, I'm not sure where you're from in the States. All of our sports leagues are trying as hard as they can right now to get legalized gambling on sports and it's because people will watch a sporting event they don't care about at all and it will be fun to watch if they have just a little money riding on it. It sort of like is steroid for engagement and until very recently with Ethereum kind of blockchain running with not that many transactions per second and slowish blocks and high fees, it's been impossible to kind of have these real money games on Think. And actually Austin I think is involved with kind of Dark Forest has shown that you can have a game that even though it's not real money in it, you can have a game that people are interested and engaged to play.
01:15:46.160 - 01:16:39.760, Speaker C: Like running over like XDI, which that one was run. But I think this is a market that I think a game that maybe a smaller team has created can compete with a much more fully featured game by only adding this extra engagement of the money being on the line. And I would say just do this and ship something because I think you're going to find that there are a lot of people that will play this game that may not play a game without that money on the line because it's just a little more like when you win, there's a little more to be happy about.
01:16:41.010 - 01:16:42.560, Speaker D: Oh yeah, for sure.
01:16:43.330 - 01:17:25.920, Speaker C: And I also think the mix of it being a skill game versus a game of luck is treated differently by laws in a lot of places and then on top of that, no one's losing. It may be much easier to keep this within the spirit of the law than gambling on games, which is what kind of a lot of people tried to do before now, like in blockchain and gaming. And so I actually like the model and I would be surprised if you ship your MVP. I think you'd have some people that would really try it out and might play and see how it does. I like it.
01:17:26.530 - 01:18:34.286, Speaker G: I think my main feedback is, first of all, the aesthetic of the game is gorgeous, right? Exactly like you said, your ability to make a game is obviously really coming together. For me, the question is, and it is for you too, you're saying how does that really merge with blockchain and what are we going to do? I'm assuming that most of the game mechanics are sort of off chain and maybe you're using blockchain for tokens. Are all those upgrades going to be on chain? Are you going to find a side chain or something that's cheaper or faster? Is it just like the final once it goes into Aave on main net, there's like that transaction and then everybody's kind of competing in the game that's not really in a smart contract to finally win that money at the end. What does the solidity look like here, I guess, or where is the smart contract action? And don't let that discourage you. You should keep building this and we should figure out how to make it work. I love the aesthetic in the first place. We'll figure out how to make it fun on chain.
01:18:34.286 - 01:18:36.180, Speaker G: I just want to know what you're thinking about that.
01:18:36.710 - 01:19:27.620, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. So we're thinking of using an NFT smart contract and so you saw there was an item that dropped out of the enemy. So not every item would kind of be on the NFT smart contract where it would give you the token and it would only specifically be something from the end game, one of the end dungeon bosses or whatever, one of the big enemies that would come after a few dozen waves or something like that. Because in zombies, you'd have the smaller enemies and then eventually you'd get the bigger boss type enemies that would eventually show up if you go far enough so those would have the chance to drop that kind of like legendary loot that would be like the NFT token. We were talking, I'm thinking you're talking about chance.
01:19:28.790 - 01:19:35.650, Speaker G: Does the player trust you and your servers that the randomness is happening? Do you go to an oracle?
01:19:35.730 - 01:20:07.630, Speaker D: We use chain Link, alarm clock and VRF for randomness. So that way it's like a verifiable randomness so that they don't feel like they're being cheated or there's any kind of rigging going on to what you do and you get your chance to get it. So they would still have to kill the certain enemy, but then that certain enemy would be the one who would trigger that verifiable random function that would then either give them the item or not give them the item. And then if they get the item, then they would have that token.
01:20:08.530 - 01:20:34.146, Speaker G: I've had this idea of almost like a game master. Like you guys are the Dungeons and Dragons game master in a way where you are kind of having to play God in a lot of ways where they still will just run around on your servers and they'll be playing around and they'll be trying things. But there may be some moment where within the game on your servers they do well and they get this magic dice roll online and that's kind of what you're talking about is your blockchain tool is this magic dice roll?
01:20:34.178 - 01:20:34.710, Speaker A: Maybe.
01:20:34.860 - 01:21:01.682, Speaker G: So then what they get is they play their game, they play their game then all of a sudden it's like, oh, this guy achieved the magic dice roll. So the game master basically allow lists them to go access that and then I'm with you now I got you. That's cool. So keep building this stuff. This is really cool stuff. I love seeing such passion in the design and the aesthetic. I love seeing stuff like that.
01:21:01.816 - 01:21:20.578, Speaker D: Awesome. Thank you so much for that feedback. And also another thing is for the lower transaction fees. That's why I was saying we are thinking of using Medic as kind of like a side chain for any of the lower transaction fees. That's something we're thinking about doing. But we're mainly going to put for the chain link one for the Verifiable.
01:21:20.754 - 01:21:43.454, Speaker G: Yeah, you can kind of do some decentralized as you need, right? For decentralization, yeah, I got you. So maybe in the middle there, there's some side chain stuff where it's just like quick fast transactions. Then when they go to Ave and mainnet stuff then that's a bigger even still. But then some off chain stuff is just your servers and that's the 3D stuff and the guys moving around. I like that. That's a cool system.
01:21:43.572 - 01:21:44.142, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah.
01:21:44.196 - 01:21:44.960, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:21:46.550 - 01:22:09.990, Speaker A: Great. Thank you Alfred for presenting. We're going to try to fit in two more projects real quick. Clash of Gears and D. Five poly. Clash of Gears are you ready to go? Yeah. Hi guys, my name is San Shudding and the project I'm building in the Lamb is called the Crash up here.
01:22:09.990 - 01:22:34.174, Speaker A: And then the goal of this project is that we have building multiple different physical lobar. And then people can have a website and then they can assign for the lobar on a website and then we can assign the lobby for them. Then they can use their lobby to fight each other. And then basically we are going to.
01:22:34.212 - 01:22:34.800, Speaker C: Use.
01:22:36.530 - 01:23:28.794, Speaker A: Every tool to ask user to stake into their money at the beginning of the competition. So basically this will be like low bar competition. So people stay their interest into the competition first and then they choose building their low bar to find their way to the top. And then for each lobar they have different unique skill represent as MFT. And then you can do many stuff unique thing to defeat the other loba. And then in the end, whoever loba stands to allow me wins. Because my English is not my strong shoes.
01:23:28.794 - 01:25:11.010, Speaker A: I'm going to show you guys a video demo video while I'm talking and then you better show what I mean by that one secondary it's. So basically like basically my goal is that we can allow the user to design their own lobby in a way wherever the way they want and two lobby can fighting each other. And then in terms of the bread chain, each lobby will assign to a unique skill snft. And then during the fight, user can also draw a random car like random car, random skill car. And then you will generate by the chain mix the thing we show on the video here. So this is one design of our 3D printing lobo. And then I'm currently working on the other one.
01:25:11.010 - 01:25:48.398, Speaker A: This one haven't fully finished yet. So that we have different shape of lobo we can provide to user and the user can modify or create roboha the way they want. So currently I'm still learning about the blockchain technique. So I would like my friend to talk more about how the blockchain is able to work with this project. Yeah. Hi guys. This is Irvin over here.
01:25:48.398 - 01:26:54.110, Speaker A: To kind of summarize, really the concept came about because there's this iOS mobile app and essentially the app is about robots and allow you to kind of put together your robots and they fight. But we think that's very simple. So since Sean is working on AR and VR stuff and I've been looking into that stuff, I feel like when you look at BattleBots, right, and people are controlling these robots within a certain location and fighting, et cetera, I think ideally, what we want to see in the near future would be sort of these kinds of events, but except that people could control these robots remotely. And one interesting idea is that rather than just the skills of the robots existing in the physical world, they could exist in the virtual world. So, for example, Sean 3D printed this flipper in swatter. Well, the swatter itself could perform different kinds of motions that could be represented as a type of NFT. And so in essence, either these kind of skills could be earned or rewarded as you fight more different kinds of robots.
01:26:54.110 - 01:27:52.146, Speaker A: And in the near future, as Sean was showing his designs that he's working on, it would be really cool to have a way for people to kind of build these robots remotely and just have them fight each other. So essentially you're designing your kind of robot and there's like these machines like I like to put things together already and then you can just fight between each other. And essentially we turn this into kind of like an esport thing. So similar to the concept from Avi where you can have a tournament and people could just fight and a few other things. So we're still working on the front end because really what we want to do is we want to be able to have a camera so it shows these two robots and just streaming this whole tournament happen live. And then just allow the people that are playing, the two people that are fighting each other to connect to the robots just via WebSocket. So we have that sort of going on and essentially if they want to join the tournament similar to the previous game and the other ones, they would have to essentially stake.
01:27:52.146 - 01:28:23.680, Speaker A: And I'm not sure if Sean went over that, but the robots themselves, internally, we attached some little sensors so that we can notice if the robot gets flipped. And since currently it's running a Raspberry Pi, we're just listening to events happening on the smart contract and we're also send an event that something has happened overall. So really that's where we're going for. It's been a bit tough just with the robots, but I think we might be able to pull this through maybe in the next coming seven days. Definitely. The robot part was pretty hard.
01:28:24.530 - 01:29:25.486, Speaker G: This is really cool. It's a lot of fun. It kind of goes to the same thing of like, where is the blockchain and where isn't it and how do you focus on finding the I actually had a very similar idea of having a camera on a world and then letting people interact with that world on chain. Could I set up my fish feeder on my fish cam? So if someone paid like a dollar of X die, it would feed my fish, right? And then their interaction with the physical world and the virtual world. And there's this element of blockchain there too. There's a lot going on here, for sure, but I love the idea of there's this live cam somewhere, like this live view of an eagle's nest or something. But really it's these two robots, and these two robots can basically be controlled by maybe it's a dow, right? Maybe you have a dow controlling each one and people are buying into the dows or using a token vote or some of these weird kind of on chain mechanics.
01:29:25.486 - 01:29:35.160, Speaker G: But to control these two physical robots that are slapping each other on the other side of the world. I think it's a really fun experiment and I like the style of all of this.
01:29:35.610 - 01:29:44.330, Speaker A: Thank you. We were thinking initially about doing like a chess robot thing, but we just thought that might be a bit boring. So the fighting part sounds exciting.
01:29:45.470 - 01:30:24.402, Speaker G: Mine were simple. Mine were just like, my son has a duplo train, and I was thinking I could definitely just set that up so whoever has the highest bid is currently controlling the train or something like that. And then maybe if the train was under a certain thing, the owner would be collecting some kind of token. You use some kind of trigger or mechanism or sensor within the real world and let people position and control things. Similar to getting into weird positions in Contracts. Right. You have to move everything in the real world just right to then unlock some cool on chain thing using sensors and all this hardware.
01:30:24.402 - 01:30:36.620, Speaker G: You have props for the hardware too? I'm an electrical engineer by training. A bad one, probably, but I love robotics and I love seeing physical stuff too. This is cool, guys.
01:30:36.990 - 01:31:10.118, Speaker A: Keep it up. Thank you, Elsie. Cool. Yeah, guys, keep it up. I'm looking forward to see maybe two robots fighting each other at the judging session or something. We're going to do one last project and that would be who did we just have DeFi? Polly, if you are here and ready to go, it's going to be our last one for the day. I know Austin and Scott probably have other things to do.
01:31:10.284 - 01:31:40.350, Speaker I: Hi everyone. Can you see my yes, yes. Okay, so DeFi poly. Just as a reminder, it's a kind of monopoly to educate people about blockchain decentralized apps and DeFi mechanisms. It's decentralized game. So every action in the game is performed by smart contract. There is no centralized server.
01:31:40.350 - 01:32:43.342, Speaker I: To talk about technical things, I had to face several challenges during this design. The first one is a full decentralization that requires random numbers and the random numbers can be provided by chainlink VRF feature. So I'm just integrating these features in my game. Second challenge is I would like seamless connections for user because I would like to address users that doesn't know blockchain yet and that doesn't have an Ethereum account. So I think portis is a very good port to connect people to the blockchain and to automatically create the account. And so it's more easy than MetaMask. I would like also fast and cheap transaction.
01:32:43.342 - 01:33:11.126, Speaker I: It's very important for this kind of game. So I'm implementing the smart contractors. I'm deploying them on Matic. It's a layer two solution. The next step I would like no fees transactions for the same reason. People doesn't have an Ethereum account at the beginning. So they don't have any native token, either Ether or Matic tokens.
01:33:11.126 - 01:34:22.930, Speaker I: So they cannot pay for the transaction. So I would like to integrate a gas relay but I would like the players to fund the gas relay indirectly. I don't want to pay for every players in my game. So what I would like is using a pool together. So people are staking money on a pool and the interest that are earned by the pool found the gas relay but that's on the layer one pulled together and the interest earnings on layer one. That means we need a connection between what happens in the layer one for the users for the pool together and the gas relay. On layer two it must be able to check if the user has contributed to the pool to allow gasless transactions.
01:34:22.930 - 01:35:15.758, Speaker I: So I don't have chosen the solution yet for that. So I still need to investigate that. And last one because there are some actions on layer one and other actions on layer two. I found port is very useful because you can easily switch from the two layers and you keep the same address. So it's very easy and completely transparent for the user. General overview we've got on layer one we can connect to pull together and generate interest to found the gas relay. And on layer two we have a contract that is a game factory.
01:35:15.758 - 01:35:51.360, Speaker I: We can create all the contracts that manage a game session and so people can interact with the game contract after that. And there is chainlink oracle on Matic. They didn't have nodes on Matic before. So I've deployed one with the support of chainlink team. It doesn't support VRF. Now. So still need to progress on that point.
01:35:51.360 - 01:36:21.990, Speaker I: Still with the support of chainlink to get the VRF working on Matic. So let's see a demo. Don't pay attention. Attention to the look and feel under progress. So that's a first connection page using portis. Let me refresh.
01:36:22.410 - 01:36:22.822, Speaker A: Yes.
01:36:22.876 - 01:37:08.520, Speaker I: So portis requires a login. No, I'm logged in on the layer one on Gurley. So here is my account. So can I have a look on etoscan this account? So to contribute to the pool, I need to stake USDC. So I need my balance of USDC to be more than ten because the stake is ten USDC and I get my stake back. So it's a fake interaction there. It's just to show the demo.
01:37:08.520 - 01:37:39.330, Speaker I: And now I have USDC. I can stake this USDC in the pool together. And I got tickets from pull together. The tickets is a proof that I've contributed to this pool. So I'm now allowed to use the guys relay during the game so I can enter the games. Now we are switching to matic.
01:37:40.710 - 01:37:41.122, Speaker A: Sorry.
01:37:41.176 - 01:37:59.080, Speaker I: It's refreshing. Whatever. It's reloading on matic. Come on. A bit long.
01:38:00.010 - 01:38:00.760, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:38:03.690 - 01:38:26.430, Speaker I: Refreshing. Now I am I'm on layer two. Same account, but on layer two. I've seen different game sessions already existing and I can join these sessions. So let's see this session. This session is managed by this contract. That's the game master contract.
01:38:26.430 - 01:39:11.482, Speaker I: I will interact with this game master. I can start the game because it's not started yet. So I will send a transaction to call the contract and say we start. We have two players. So here is the second player. So it's another account. It's 9471-9471.
01:39:11.482 - 01:39:40.994, Speaker I: Is this one. Okay? So I've got two players on the same game. Sorry, need to refresh because I should be able to play. I am the next player. No, he is the next player. Yeah.
01:39:41.052 - 01:39:48.060, Speaker A: Unfortunately, we are ten minutes over time. So I want to make sure we at least get some feedback from Austin and Scott real quick.
01:39:48.430 - 01:40:10.090, Speaker I: Yeah. Harold, my achievements, you see the demo and the things that remains to be done still a lot of things. Integrate pool together, integrate the gas relay and complete the game.
01:40:10.540 - 01:40:32.128, Speaker G: I would say don't worry about the gas relay. Don't worry about pool together. Don't do anything on l one. Focus right in on that l two piece where those two players were playing and they were rolling the dice. That's where it's all about. Make that fun. Focusing on making the game fun for the players will get you.
01:40:32.128 - 01:40:57.596, Speaker G: You will make way more money in the long run than you will on some sponsorship prize. If you can make a game that's fun for people to play. I would focus on this right here, the onboarding getting people to the moment where they're rolling the dice and they're playing the game and get rid of all the bumps in between. I understand you're saying gas network or gas station network or something like that. You can assume that they're going to have gas, they're going to be ready to play, set it up so they can do what you're doing right now. And I think that's the key piece.
01:40:57.658 - 01:41:02.510, Speaker I: S all right, thanks.
01:41:06.320 - 01:41:20.290, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought it was going to be Monopoly, but on the blockchain. But then the game looks more like a dice rolling game.
01:41:23.080 - 01:41:51.820, Speaker I: It's a monopoly. It's inspired by Monopoly. It's not exactly Monopoly. I've changed a rule. I've adapted the rules to the crypto ecosystems. So you can launch ACOs, you can stake money, you can do these kind of things to use DeFi mechanisms in the game. It's like Monopoly, but it's not the same rules has been adapted.
01:41:52.880 - 01:42:34.730, Speaker C: Yeah, okay. Yeah. I don't know if the branding should make it seem exactly like Monopoly. And then you get in there and there's actually an original game because there's so many times Monopoly itself has done a Disney movie version of Monopoly. And so I thought it was going to be exactly Monopoly. And then when you get in and it's actually like an original game that's a bit inspired by Monopoly, I think you might be kind of down selling yourself a little bit. I agree.
01:42:35.180 - 01:42:36.888, Speaker G: Creating something really cool here.
01:42:36.974 - 01:42:57.410, Speaker C: Yeah, you've created something new, but there's Star Wars Monopoly, which is literally Monopoly with different Star Wars names as the Monopoly. But you're kind of like, I'm expecting that. But then once I get in, it's a new game, so I might kind of communicate the originality a bit better and not sell yourself short.
01:42:58.340 - 01:43:01.090, Speaker A: So maybe it's as simple as a different name.
01:43:03.060 - 01:43:27.930, Speaker C: Yes, that probably do the trick. Maybe like DeFi mogul or something. But I don't know. Just like something that kind of communicates that it's a new game because that'll make people like novelty when they're trying a new product. And so more people probably want to try something if they think it's going to be something they haven't seen before.
01:43:29.440 - 01:43:37.870, Speaker I: Okay, good. It's easier to explain when I say it's like Monopoly, but it's a bit different.
01:43:39.200 - 01:43:59.700, Speaker C: Yeah, but I don't know. I think it's interesting. I definitely agree with all Austin said. Just know, focus on the user. If you continue with this after the hackathon, definitely focus on the user and less on the sponsors or the integrations.
01:44:01.320 - 01:44:16.810, Speaker A: It's a constant challenge for hackers figuring out what to prioritize. But yeah, it's good to see you're at this point. And you still got a week to work out maybe some of the issues with having two players going. So I'm looking forward to see how you resolve those things.
01:44:19.020 - 01:44:20.376, Speaker I: Cool, thanks.
01:44:20.478 - 01:44:41.456, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you. Ludo all right, we are 15 minutes over, so I want to thank everybody for sticking around, including Scott and Austin. These guys are awesome and you should follow them everywhere. They are very wise crypto men. They've got knowledge out the wazoo. So.
01:44:41.456 - 01:45:23.070, Speaker A: We're going to wrap here. If anybody has any questions or something that didn't get resolved, try to ping me in the discord and I'll see what I can do. And remember that your video for next week is four minutes max. So it might feel impossible when you start to record yourself talking about it, but it is actually possible. You want to get your concept across very quickly. And then this video is super important for getting judges to understand what your intention was with what you're building and how far you came along with that intention. So start to when you're going through your demos or practicing yourself, just keep that in mind.
01:45:23.070 - 01:45:41.700, Speaker A: We'll have details on judging, hopefully before this weekend. And any questions, again, just reach out to one, the team members. All right, we're going to wrap here. Thanks, everybody, for coming. We'll see you in the discord. Happy Thursday. Thanks, Thursday.
01:45:41.700 - 01:45:43.280, Speaker A: Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Austin.
