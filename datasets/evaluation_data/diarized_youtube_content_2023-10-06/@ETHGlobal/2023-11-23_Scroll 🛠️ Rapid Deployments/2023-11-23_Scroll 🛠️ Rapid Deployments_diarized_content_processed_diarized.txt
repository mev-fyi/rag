00:00:07.130 - 00:00:55.280, Speaker A: Scroll is very easy, it's very easy for everyone to deploy scroll. As you know, scroll is a CKE VM and we have a lot of documentations and guide about everything you need to get started. And also if you are hacking on basically on scroll. So today I bring you a couple of guides so you can start deploying on scroll. So everything that you need to get started is just, you can just add scroll sepolia to your metamask. Okay. So the wallet on scroll works the same as anyone else.
00:00:55.280 - 00:01:46.830, Speaker A: So you can just go to. We have some guide so you can get started. You just need to change your RPC and you will be good to go. And yeah, we're just going to go through a couple of deployments as an example, let's just to test deploy as example ERC 20 token. So you can just go and the same as what you're used to make sure that for example on remix you're on metamask and that you are connected to scroll. This is scroll testnet. So what we're going to do here is just deploy a small contract.
00:01:46.830 - 00:02:48.918, Speaker A: So this as you can see is a very like, this is here just like a demo. For example, I'm going to name it test token and I'm going to print 1 million. We are using open sepling libraries. You can use whatever library you're used to. If you're used to hardhat, if you're used to foundry, you can use it the same as you will use as what you're used to. So here you're deployed here and you can perfectly add your newly imported token here. So here, yeah, this is like an example.
00:02:48.918 - 00:03:32.290, Speaker A: Deployment is something that you should be used to and also scroll. As you know, the story of scroll was born from the CkeVM project that targets to convert Ethereum into a layer one ck, which is something that is very exciting but also not to do in the short time. Something that we may have to wait a little bit to happen. But scroll uses the same code to make a roll up. A CKA evm roll up. Basically if you like Ethereum, I think you will also like scroll. That's why I joined scroll because I really like Ethereum and I feel like Ethereum and Scroll are very bounded in terms of the code.
00:03:32.290 - 00:04:31.010, Speaker A: In terms of the team scroll is supporting is the biggest contributor now to the CKVM project with the PSE from Ethereum foundation which the team that created the project in the first. So basically a lot of Ethereum native projects have deployed now on scroll. So we're going to go through some of them starting with Chainlink. So basically both on Testnet and on Mainet we have integrated with Chainlink. So if you're looking to hacking with Chainlink, you can also use scroll. And yeah, for example here we have the current price of it updated. We're taking a lot of care of our testnet.
00:04:31.010 - 00:05:33.754, Speaker A: So yeah, I think we're working very hard. So anyone can basically integrate a lot of things with scroll. So here also there is uni v three. But I'm going to skip it, just go straight to Ave because Ave is also part of this hackathon. So I'm just going to show you some demo on ave integration. So this is ave smart contract. Something that I think is very cool that having ave in your platform because usually when you have projects that require staking, you usually want to basically it allows you to earn money just by staking while you're doing something else.
00:05:33.754 - 00:06:21.766, Speaker A: So I think it's like a good addition to whatever project that you're doing, especially if it involves defi. So here in this demo, I just wanted to show you Dai, I have a little bit of die here on my wallet. This is Testnet, dai on Testnet. So yeah, I have 89 die and I'm just going to swap it for USD. I'm just going to stake it on ave so I can use these functions to stake so I can put the amount that I want to stake. And I'm just going to go to my Dai contract which is this one. And I'm going to connect my wallet.
00:06:21.766 - 00:07:19.550, Speaker A: And this is another project. I'm very happy that it's on scroll. This is Etherscan. So if you're used to using Etherscan for verifying your contracts or just using the API or just for navigating this also integrated on scroll. And yeah, just going to approve my contract, my die approve here. And I'm going to just deposit one die and yeah, just going to approve here just to approve one die and then I'm going to basically stake it. So here, just calling this stake function in the background, it's calling the supply function from Ave.
00:07:19.550 - 00:08:13.530, Speaker A: And you can go to, once everything is done, we will be able to go to the Ave app and we will be able to, so here for example, scroll as you can see, fully integrated on Ave, also on the front end. So we're going to see our new supply token. So here I'm going to supply, once this is confirmed, we should be able to see the supply token here. So yeah, many projects coming to scroll. Many projects that are on the hackathon are already on scroll that you can integrate. I'm going to share a cheat sheet for other projects that you can integrate with. And yeah, as you can see here, this is the die that I just applied.
00:08:13.530 - 00:09:15.926, Speaker A: So yes, just a lot of tools that you can play around with. We have also other demo that I wanted to show you is the aztec noir demo. So this is like the example, the demo that noir gives you as your first smart contract. So here we're just like proving that x and y are different numbers without revealing one number. Very simple example. But how can you connect noir from Aztec with Scroll or any other EVM projects? So basically on noir, you can generate your circuits with zero knowledge and then it will generate a smart contract on solidity that you can deploy scroll or anywhere else. And then you can just generate the proof in your browser using wasm, which is very cool.
00:09:15.926 - 00:09:47.200, Speaker A: We can generate now proofs on our browser which is very ideal for user experience. And then this is the proof here, this proof, you can submit it to a blockchain to verify that the computation was done correctly. And of course we can do it on scroll. And here I'm just going to confirm. So far I verified six. This is like full on solidity code. We can go through the code if you're interested.
00:09:47.200 - 00:10:40.942, Speaker A: Basically, I'm just going to update a counter in a solidity contract if it succeeded. So, yeah, now it was proven. So, yeah, different stuff. So I just want to show you one last thing. So what you need to start working on developing on scroll now is basically just testnet it. We have faucets and we also have, this is. So we have faucets and we also have, and the RPC provider, that's the only thing that you need.
00:10:40.942 - 00:11:19.654, Speaker A: If you're interested, we can pass bar or boot just getting one of these or just graph some from me. And the other thing that I would like you to see is our cheat sheet. So basically all the projects that are here on the hackathon that are integrated with scroll, for example, we have. So for example, we have the graph integrated with both Scroll Testnet and Mainnet. You can start indexing your contract with the graph studio now on scroll chain link we have privates, you can use it too. Safe. We have both the safes and also the safe factory.
00:11:19.654 - 00:11:42.850, Speaker A: So you can deploy also a front end for the safe. And also we have the API, the service API. So yeah, you can give users good user experience. We also have some tutorials, a lot of tutorials. With Noir, like the one that I show you if you're interested in CK and don't want to use noir. We also have tested Socrates and circum. It works perfectly fine on scroll.
00:11:42.850 - 00:12:45.014, Speaker A: So yeah, we also have other projects that we have demo if you are interested in doing interaction with scroll because as you know, scroll, it's open source, it's EVM. So you can do the things that you're used to. And also we have some guys about verifying our contracts for our scroll bounty. You can apply by just deploying whatever contract that you think it's a good idea. It's interesting, whatever that you want and the only thing that we ask you to is just basically deploy and scroll and verify your contract. So yeah, I went very rushing here, just rushed to it just for our technical issues. But I don't know if you guys have any questions or something that you want to share or.
00:12:45.014 - 00:12:53.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if any questions. So far all good. Okay, thank you guys.
