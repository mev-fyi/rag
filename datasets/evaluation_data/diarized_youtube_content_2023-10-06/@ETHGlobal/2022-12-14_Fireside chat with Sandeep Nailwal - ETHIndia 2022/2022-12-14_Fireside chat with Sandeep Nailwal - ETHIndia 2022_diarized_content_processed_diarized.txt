00:00:00.410 - 00:00:01.200, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:00:06.050 - 00:00:39.898, Speaker B: All right. Those were just some of our partners. And the next thing I want to do is use this opening ceremony as an opportunity to bring on somebody special in this space. We usually use this hour to talk about what all of us are excited about in the future. And today I'm excited to welcome Sundeep from Polygon. We're going to cover a lot of things about the future of the space india, Web Three, and a man who needs no introduction, of course, here. Super honored to have the chance to share the stage with you.
00:00:39.898 - 00:00:46.586, Speaker B: Welcome, Sandeep. Thanks. So we've known each other, first of.
00:00:46.608 - 00:01:20.520, Speaker A: All, when I came here and entered this hall, my first reaction was, what the fuck did we do? I was standing with the Dev Polio people Eat Global, as we were talking about like, 2018 when we started, and look where we are today. I was thinking, like, taking a pick and sending to Vitalik, let's see, what did we do? Because I met him in 2019 somewhere and I was saying that India is going to be the biggest ecosystem and all that. And he's like, yeah, we'll see today. Here we are.
00:01:21.370 - 00:01:46.000, Speaker B: I remember you in 2018, back when used to be called Matic, handing out T shirts to people at the Maddox Booth. And here we are seeing an incredible progress and growth in the last four years. My first question to you is focusing on the personal side. Tell us about your personal journey into Web Three and how you got started.
00:01:47.650 - 00:02:46.658, Speaker A: Yeah, so I started back in the day in 2015, end of 2015, when I was doing my previous startup, and it was B, two B, and it was not scaling as fast as ever thought. And I thought that I want to go into the deep tech space. And I had heard about Bitcoin back in 2013, but initially that time, I thought that it did not just make sense to me. Right. So then in 2016, when I first went into AI a little bit and then heard about Bitcoin again, I thought, that what? This thing is still alive, this is still around, like, what's going on here? So then I went into that Bitcoin white paper and all that, and I actually did not see it as money and changing the money. At that point in time, I had a good understanding of geopolitics and all that. I realized that, okay, this makes sense.
00:02:46.658 - 00:03:27.902, Speaker A: But what I saw as an engineer, I thought is that this is basically somebody build this decentralized network, which is right now solving a small computation, small logic, which is payment logic. You pay to me a minus B amount and B's balance goes up. And I thought at that time, what if we could do complex business logic in this kind of setting? That could be useful for a lot of things. And then I was on and off and all that and then three, four weeks into this, I stumbled on Ethereum. And I think Ethereum then went from fifty cents to nine dollars and all that. And I read the first line, I read like generalized smart contracts and this. And I said, oh shit, this is big.
00:03:27.902 - 00:03:53.974, Speaker A: And that is the time I took two weeks. In two weeks, I sent a mail to all my clients. I said, guys, I'm shutting it down. I will still help you for next six months to make sure that it's transitioned out. But I am going all in into that. And I left. Everything went back to coming from my background, where I come from, going back to zero money making, where I am the one putting the food on the table for my whole family, parents, everyone.
00:03:53.974 - 00:04:01.098, Speaker A: It was a hard choice, but I think that it was very clear that this is going to be very big. And here we are.
00:04:01.184 - 00:04:11.760, Speaker B: That's a lot of conviction, especially back then. What was the ecosystem like in India and kind of could you share more on how hard or easy or hard things were?
00:04:12.290 - 00:04:24.906, Speaker A: Yeah, I think at that point in time, it was only initially some crypto trading communities, like there was almost zero development communities. There were one or two researchers.
00:04:25.018 - 00:04:26.370, Speaker B: What year are we talking here?
00:04:26.440 - 00:04:53.114, Speaker A: This year? We are talking about 2017 early also. Like mid 2016 or early. That was very early for Ethereum also, right? But even 2017 early. There was nobody even till 2017. And there were few developers who are working for future foreign companies. And then we started in early 2018. And first time we received, we heard that ETH India is happening in this one.
00:04:53.114 - 00:05:13.406, Speaker A: And we interacted with my brother, like Shakti, who's not here now, but what a man. And we interacted and we said that this is absolutely needed over there. And then when we were starting, we initially were thinking that we will get probably 100 people registering and things like that. Like just that low.
00:05:13.588 - 00:05:15.358, Speaker B: We thought that too at that point.
00:05:15.444 - 00:05:39.590, Speaker A: But the good part was you said 44% were people were new in Web Three that time. I think 100% were new to Web three. But yeah, here we are. I think you guys have done amazing job globally and in India. Shout out to Dev Folio team. After all of these problems and all that, striving hard to build this dev community in India. Organic Dev community in India.
00:05:39.590 - 00:06:30.406, Speaker A: And actually, if you can give me one or two more minutes, I wanted to share when we saw Shakti over there, even the Dev Polio team was here and we all got emotional looking at Shakti. And that's the spirit of I think India's web3 ecosystem also like back in the day when after ETH Global also 2018, then there was a big bear market and all that. Nobody would give money for hackathons and things like that. And I and Shakti would have lot of these discussions that Shakti is like, I don't have enough runway for next three, four months and all that. And we would say, okay, let's keep trying. Even we were very small. We never got any VC funding and all that, right? So sometimes like $10,000, $20,000, these kind of grants, that, okay, let's keep pushing, let's keep pushing.
00:06:30.406 - 00:07:03.940, Speaker A: Let's keep trying more. And then after all this bear market and all that, after 2019, East India, then came this COVID slump, right? Like, absolutely everything got destroyed. And I remember that after second or third day after the lockdown, I and Shakti were discussing, and it looked like even for polygon, things were tight, right? But then again, we said, that okay, bro, let's try more time. Let's try some more time. Let's try some more time. We started like Dev Polio team, switched into online hackathons completely. And then we started doing monthly hackathons and all that.
00:07:03.940 - 00:07:40.842, Speaker A: And then Shakti and I were speaking, let's say, and then he says that I have some sort of fever. Tomorrow I can't join this call. And that was the time when he got COVID. And then he was in a tier three city in India, and there was no facility also in the hospital, no medicine coming in. And I started that crypto leaf fund, right? And we worked very hard, like I, Akash and his team members and all that. And in the last few days, we even arranged a ventilator. Like, somebody traveled from India with a whole ventilator to the hospital.
00:07:40.842 - 00:08:00.360, Speaker A: And he enters the hospital, and they say that it's not needed, right? But one thing I was very sad for multiple days, but one thing I am proud of, that we still tried really hard. And that's the spirit of Indian web3. We keep trying, and one day we are going to make India a web3 superpower. Fucking superpower in web3.
00:08:01.050 - 00:08:35.118, Speaker B: We're going to dig a lot into that as far as hand part of the same story. And there's a lot that's happened in the last four years. And I think the thing to remember is that we came out strong and united and bigger than we were even a year ago. And that's what we should remember. I do want to switch a bit of gears and kind of talk about how we see the future of this space. I want to ask a fairly blunt question. Polygon is not really a layer two.
00:08:35.118 - 00:08:36.480, Speaker B: What do you say to.
00:08:39.010 - 00:09:07.962, Speaker A: Really like, as we said, polygon is ethereum's internet of blockchains. We don't subscribe to this narrow definition of layer two, which means that you have to keep all the data back on layer two. You also need to have full security on layer two and everything. We believe that it is a spectrum. Even chains like Polygon, chains like XDI, nosis chain, they all have added a lot of network effects into ethereum. As far as the communities are.
00:09:08.016 - 00:09:10.454, Speaker B: So maybe let's talk about how you're aligned with Ethereum.
00:09:10.582 - 00:09:56.326, Speaker A: Yes, so that's exactly why. So we are like hardcore Ethereum community people. And what we have done is if you see in the last whole 2020 and Karthik, we have been seeing 2021 22, like this whole Elven wars. If you ask yourself who saved Ethereum from these l One wars? We were the ones who were fighting tooth and nail on the trenches against these. They completely run away into adoption and all that. But the thing being that we want to provide this Ethereum stack, the EVM stack to the developers in the range of decentralization. At the end, what we are doing at Polygon is we are providing decentralized compute on top of Ethereum.
00:09:56.326 - 00:10:55.882, Speaker A: And that decentralized compute comes on a spectrum you can have. Like if you are a startup who has only 100 users right now, do you need Ethereum kind of security? You probably might be okay with having your own. Let's say you're working on a side chain which has like maybe if it's a dedicated chain, even two validators or if you are on a public chain, you can have Polygon POS 100 validators and all that decent enough security for you. But if as you keep growing across the cycle, you can actually be deployed on like Zkevm today, which has full Ethereum security and I think that is our commitment to Ethereum. We are the first in market, fully available source code available, Zkevm, fully built out all features. And that's also is my message to all of you guys test out Zkevm while all these bounties, I would say apply them on Zkevm instead of Mumbai testnet and all that. And you will see the experience already we know more than 2000 smart contracts have been deployed.
00:10:55.882 - 00:11:18.526, Speaker A: The user experience is absolutely fabulous. And we have David, my co founder, who has built this Zke EVM like product head there. He's there with you. If you have any queries, ask with him. Ask from him. And that's our commitment to Ethereum. And you will see some of very big announcements from us which will show that what are our plans for Ethereum? Because that's the fun part about Ethereum.
00:11:18.526 - 00:11:24.642, Speaker A: Ethereum is not only Vitalik's or Ethereum foundation network, it is your network. It is our network and we also have plans for Ethereum.
00:11:24.706 - 00:11:46.074, Speaker B: And you'll see that's wonderful. I'm looking forward to what these announcements are. Hopefully we get some alpha here. But obviously ZK everything is what the talk of the town is. Polygon has three ZK initiatives. Why do you have three? And kind of what's the thinking behind having these parallel approaches?
00:11:46.202 - 00:12:29.500, Speaker A: Yes. So ZK technology, especially when we were starting like one year back, it was such an early stage, although we have seen a hockey streak growth in the ZK technology, but it was such an early stage that even betting on one out of three four approaches available is very risky. And remember that we are coming from the burnt of hardburn of plasma. Right? We remember plasma and we were the only team like nobody respects the fact that we were the only team which built a production ready plasma. Everybody just left it like it doesn't work and all that no longer hyped up. So we are leaving. Right? So we built it fully but people ended up using the POS part more because it was easy to use.
00:12:29.500 - 00:12:52.162, Speaker A: Now we did not want to take first of all, it was very clear in our mind that we don't want to be stuck in one approach which fails eventually, right. So we were very clear. So that is one reason. Second reason is that layer two, as we say layer one is for decentralization and security. Layer two is for experimentation where apps can experiment at scale with user experience and things like that.
00:12:52.216 - 00:12:57.270, Speaker B: Is that the same as compute to you or is there differentiation between experimentation and compute?
00:12:58.650 - 00:12:59.990, Speaker A: I didn't get the question.
00:13:00.140 - 00:13:06.198, Speaker B: So you said layer two is about experimentation. Is that the same as compute? Because you previously mentioned compute will be.
00:13:06.204 - 00:14:19.360, Speaker A: On yes, you have much more spectrum of compute. You will have cheaper compute and you will have costly but more secure compute and you can experiment with it like what kind of application you are building, right? If you are building DFI, you probably need very heavily Ethereum secured capacity. But if you are building a game, a casual game where people are going to own $510 worth of NFTs then you are probably okay with less decentralized or not secured with Ethereum but fairly decentralized this thing. Right? But what I was saying is that about these three ZK solutions like these three ZK solutions, first two of them are working on EVM compatibility only but they have the difference in approaches. But the third approach and I don't want to disclose more over there, but as I said that we have very strong plans for Ethereum and Ethereum's defensibility. So next time somebody comes to you and say that hey, I have this L one and I am supporting Rust or I am supporting this programming language, that programming language, we will make sure that you will get all those programming languages, all those fancy programming constructs available on top of Ethereum. That's why these three different approaches and you are going to see some really fun stuff coming from us.
00:14:20.050 - 00:14:38.802, Speaker B: Hopefully you realize this thing. But you just announced something that you guys are working on. I'm not going to repeat it. You guys have to watch and pause the video after this to really read between the lines. That's incredible. So in a way it's a good thing if all three approaches work and it's not just about increasing your ODS.
00:14:38.866 - 00:15:31.894, Speaker A: To see one of the also it was so early that out of these three approaches that's why we were able to build this Zkevm in last probably eight months where people are working for last four years. Why? Because we had this cross pollination of these ideas. And you might discuss this with David also that first what they were building at Hermes, borrowing a lot of ideas from Zero and Maiden, they were able to build it much faster, much more efficient and much more concise. Like we have some other ZK implementations which already are running into tens of thousands of lines of code where we have like 4000 very crisp and efficiently written lines of code, which can be very easily not easily, but they can be fairly audited. And we believe that this will be much more production ready, much faster than anybody else.
00:15:32.092 - 00:16:07.220, Speaker B: I mean, I can't wait for that because all the hackers get to try this out and break it apart. So you get to fix it after. I think a lot of what you just said so far is coming from the perspective of applying research and kind of making those things go to production and that's great. But you're also at the same time talking about or talking to a lot of companies with partnerships, launches, getting more and more consumer applications into this space. Research stuff aside, what is the biggest problem that the Polygon ecosystem is facing right now? Or rather what keeps you up at night?
00:16:07.670 - 00:17:11.894, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think with all of what has happened in the past few days or weeks, it's a good and the bad part both because last one year there has been war cry that we need to go mainstream, we are too niche. But I think with what all happened, the mainstream adoption will slightly become slightly slower. But then we have to go back to our roots with the niche community and build out and work more on these niche use cases. That's why I think this ETH global hackathon, ETH India and other hackathons become very very relevant. Because here is where many kind of new ideas are going to be taking birth right and those ideas are going to become very relevant. That's why it's very important for you guys also to build differentiated products in DeFi in NFT. And there is a very high possibility that you might get accelerated growth in some of those things.
00:17:11.894 - 00:17:35.680, Speaker A: Because the focus has come back to these things. Instead of only being on the Instagram and Reddits and these big Starbucks of the world, the focus is back to the developer here and back to self custody and all those core fundamentals of web3. And that's why it's very relevant. I hope that just like we have seen in the past ETH India, we'll see some big companies coming out from this.
00:17:36.210 - 00:17:44.894, Speaker B: I totally agree with that. But I'm going to give you a hard time here. You didn't answer my question. What is the biggest problem polygon is facing?
00:17:44.942 - 00:18:40.500, Speaker A: Sorry? Yes. So one of the biggest problem is I want to see more innovation. Like that's what I said in this one. Also more innovation. It's not specific to Polygon, but I would say in India ecosystem also more innovative products coming out which have some sort of differentiated product offering, go to market offering and things like that, it's no longer relevant. Like if you guys come up like okay, I build an NFT marketplace or I build a lending borrowing system, no? What is the differentiation in your product? And also I want to give a message that across the overall this polygon connect yesterday like 2000 people were there and multiple events that old model of and especially relevant to web3 that you do a token and this token will do well and things like that, that does not work. Not only it is not recommended, it does not work now.
00:18:40.500 - 00:19:14.494, Speaker A: If let's say you end up launching a token with a non differentiated product and all that and you are thinking that I'll get listed and this token will do like market dance and whatever. I think first of all, it doesn't work now because the market does not have that kind of capital. We all had like 15 years of bull market infinite capital. That is no longer relevant. And also the community is much more scrutinizing for everything. So when you want to do this, make sure you do it right. Don't do it for the sake of it, for the heck of it, and don't do it in a hassled way.
00:19:14.494 - 00:19:31.534, Speaker A: Build a product, build a community. And when the community and you see a real relevant value accrual, value capture for the token, then only go for those token related things. Don't chase the token mania that is going to be harmful for your longer term journey.
00:19:31.582 - 00:19:37.560, Speaker B: And it's not just that it doesn't work. We know that factually because we've seen that from experience.
00:19:38.170 - 00:19:38.630, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:19:38.700 - 00:19:43.158, Speaker B: There's a lot of years of case studies here of proving this point.
00:19:43.324 - 00:20:15.586, Speaker A: No, actually I learned also from you because I've been very focused on exponential ecosystem growth and I think I have debated with you also multiple times. And I learned one thing always from you, whenever I met you all over the world that you were always thinking of like okay, right now it works, it's hyped up and all that. But you would be like I don't see how it survives ten years from now, five years from now, right? And I think that's why people like you who have made investments in those things, those would have survived. Large part of your investments would have survived. Otherwise many of them got wiped out.
00:20:15.768 - 00:20:17.570, Speaker B: Only the paranoid survive.
00:20:17.910 - 00:20:37.558, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So I'm also trying to learn more from that. Even for the ecosystem, we want to support those applications who we see that these are going to exist five years, ten years from now. And these are going to build sustainable business models not only about this cash raise and funds and things like that.
00:20:37.644 - 00:21:11.570, Speaker B: This is an interesting theme right there's. So many engineers here, so many developers here, and we're excited about just playing with the latest technologies, the latest frameworks, and we see interesting, smart, contract use cases as innovative for what we think Web Three can do. But it's way bigger than that, and we kind of touched on this thing. So I want to actually go back to something that you said earlier, which is the impact of crypto is not just in software. Let's talk about crypto relief. Tell us about what crypto relief was and what's happened the last two and a half years.
00:21:11.720 - 00:21:14.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, crypto relief, for example.
00:21:15.850 - 00:21:17.142, Speaker B: Tell us how it started.
00:21:17.276 - 00:21:49.098, Speaker A: Yeah, so crypto relief started when my sister traveled to my place, and India was having this huge delta wave of COVID and all that, and everybody was left, right and center. Like, I was trying to volunteer for a few people, helping them with money, things like that. And then we would start with twelve people in the morning, and then by afternoon, six are gone. Right. That was the kind of situation that was there. And I was already trying to do something. But then my sister traveled to my place, and she got COVID.
00:21:49.098 - 00:22:15.190, Speaker A: And I also got COVID. Like, actually when I started and wrote that tweet, that's a very angry I myself have had COVID. The second time, I was like, screw this virus. Because we have this fight and flight response, right? Until now. At that time, we were in the flight mode, just go inside the house, stay there, locked up everything. I said, screw this virus. Not only I'm going to fight with this virus with my family, but I'm going to help other people also.
00:22:15.190 - 00:23:03.410, Speaker A: And I wrote that tweet. I thought probably we'll get like $1 million, $2 million. But then what Vitalik ended up doing with the shiba coin with a billion. Yeah, even he thought, like, later on he said that I thought it is going to be $10 million or something. And then we ended up getting like $450,000,000 and all that. And I'm very proud to say, even though it's like, slightly unfortunate for Web Three and crypto industry in India, that here it's like an environment of slight distrust on it and all that because governments fully don't understand this. But an important statistics for you all, even in this room, if you are an adult and you got vaccinated, one out of every three of you guys are vaccinated using the syringe donated by Crypto Leaf.
00:23:03.490 - 00:23:08.374, Speaker B: Like we donated incredible. That's 100 what, 200 million people.
00:23:08.492 - 00:23:22.714, Speaker A: 200 million syringes we donated with UNICEF. And at that point in time, India got vaccines, but now there was a syringe problem. So we liaised with UNICEF, worked all around the world, and got in 200 million syringes in India.
00:23:22.842 - 00:23:27.150, Speaker B: That is an impact that you literally cannot compete with.
00:23:27.220 - 00:23:43.970, Speaker A: Yes. And I want to say that is the impact of vitalik. Also, people keep asking me, but people don't realize that it's all because of vitalik. That's the impact of vitalik. And I would say ETH community also because he only gathered this thing. So shout out to the whole Ethereum community.
00:23:44.040 - 00:24:12.000, Speaker B: Globally, ethereum is the ultimate coordination mechanism for the world and this is incredible progress. All right, I want to try to wrap this up soon. So let's go into a couple of specifics about what we should look forward to this weekend. 2000 people are sitting in front of us. The camera can't see it, but we can. What should they be thinking about and what should they be excited about to build in this space?
00:24:13.170 - 00:24:52.042, Speaker A: What I'm excited to build? Yes. And I want to give this message again to all indian developer fraternity, right? Build niche crypto use cases. I see the tendency in Indian developers that we are still going towards utility. Like okay, let me build on this particular thing like a SaaS. Our mental model is more like building SaaS, building some profitable business and all that. I am saying that start thinking about niche crypto use cases. If you are building DeFi, build some these option models perpetuals and more optimized DEXes and things like that.
00:24:52.042 - 00:25:05.180, Speaker A: There are so many ideas going around, even in DeFi, think about that. If there are any finance people liaise with them, brainstorm these ideas and all that. Even in NFTs and PFPs, I don't think a lot of Indian developers have done big.
00:25:05.550 - 00:25:20.980, Speaker B: Maybe as you're answering that, I'd love to kind of hear your thoughts on NFTs and DAOs and DeFi. Are you excited about still those things or how do you see them now, the NFTs, NFTs, DeFi, DAOs as topics? Do you think there's still room to build more?
00:25:21.670 - 00:25:58.986, Speaker A: Sure, I feel that now they are much more relevant. Like if you were thinking of building a mainstream mass media kind of application now the focus is back onto these niche users. That's why I'm saying that maybe spend more time on your idea even here and once you go home. Because I feel like my mission is that how we are going to make India a web3 superpower is by building multiple unicorns. Web three unicorns from India. And they will only be built if you build differentiated products. And right now the right time is for building those niche use cases.
00:25:58.986 - 00:27:15.154, Speaker A: If you are building NFT marketplace, think like what Pseudoswap has done, right? Can you solve those kind of use cases? NFT liquidity don't build the straightforward use cases. Like can you solve NFT liquidity by some means? Right? Or in DAOs, how can you solve decision making processes in Dao? That's the biggest problem, right? Think about like if DAOs are going to be running businesses, then they would have to take some sort of privacy decisions. Also, how can you make sure that there are things which can be highly confidential thing in the context of a Dao, but still the Dao can take the decision on that, right? Think about these kind of things and even in DeFi, like for example, how DeFi products can manage their treasury, how they can increase the liquidity in their protocols and things like that. Like not the plain vanilla use cases because right now the markets we are in, not only in crypto, generally startup markets, it's very, very hard to raise capital. And in order for you to grow and go to the next stage, you need to build these differentiated products. In this market, only the paranoid will survive and only the differentiated will survive. So make sure that you have those differentiation and build those niche use cases.
00:27:15.154 - 00:27:27.354, Speaker A: Like let's build most innovative products, at least idea level. I know that in two days you can't build but at least on an idea level, let's see some of the best projects, some of the most innovative projects coming out of you guys. That's what I want you guys to do.
00:27:27.472 - 00:28:01.702, Speaker B: I know it sounds very counterintuitive, but to synthesize this is the perfect time for you to just try things because it might be cool and not because it can be a business. This is how large change happens. And once something is working or once something is interesting to somebody, you will figure out eventually how do you turn that into a product or a business. But especially when you have a small time constraint here the goal should be experimentation, as you already talked about and it should be the weird, crazy shit that you really want to see.
00:28:01.756 - 00:28:31.598, Speaker A: That's why I think I forgot when you asked that what is the thing that keeps you up and all that? What is the thing you're worried about? And at Polygon also, as I was discussing with you that we wanted to build Polygon as the business layer of web3 where the businesses are built. But especially now, the time is that again, going back to the core web3 roots where you build things which are really cool, they might not look like as a business today, like Uniswap didn't look like a business when Hayden started. Right?
00:28:31.684 - 00:28:34.846, Speaker B: We didn't know what AMMS could do. Now it's the default.
00:28:34.958 - 00:29:16.990, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. And build things like that because maybe they are cool. You are extremely thinking about something innovative or think about building things which have an impact. This is what I feel for Polygon community. I want to grow this segment where people who want to change the world not only build the business, who want to change the world, those kind of people into the Polygon community also, especially I was in Europe, and because a lot of our co founders, especially Jordy and all that, jordy is also a legend from the Ethereum community. I saw a lot of pride in a European community of Polygon. Even I heard this term called Polygon maxi.
00:29:16.990 - 00:29:18.606, Speaker A: I.
00:29:18.628 - 00:29:20.110, Speaker B: Think that's what we call success.
00:29:20.260 - 00:29:37.142, Speaker A: Yes. So people are trying to build things which can make an impact on the world. And that's why I think we also have a track where this is public goods. Like, how can you make an impact on the world with these things? Try to build those things. Not immediately focused on that. This can be a business. This can be a business.
00:29:37.142 - 00:29:48.946, Speaker A: This is the right time to build those cool experimentations ideas because some of them are going to be so compelling that they will be the ones that will end up getting capital and growth opportunities.
00:29:49.138 - 00:29:53.158, Speaker B: I think that's a perfect note to end this on. Sandeep, thank you so much for joining us.
00:29:53.244 - 00:29:55.540, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone. Let's make it big, guys.
