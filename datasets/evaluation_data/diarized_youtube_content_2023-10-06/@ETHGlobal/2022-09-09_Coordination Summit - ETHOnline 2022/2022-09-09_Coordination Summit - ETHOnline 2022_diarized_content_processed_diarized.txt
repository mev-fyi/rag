00:01:55.710 - 00:01:56.260, Speaker A: You.
00:01:58.230 - 00:02:37.738, Speaker B: Good morning, good afternoon. Good evening everybody. I'm Carteik, one of the co founders of Eat Global, and I am super excited to welcome all of you to our Coordination Summit for Eat Online 2022. We got an amazing next 4 hours planned for all of you and appreciate everybody's patience in us getting started. They're all watching this on eGlobal TV and this is what we're going to be using today to not not only watch everything, but also to be communicating with all of our speakers. If you have any questions, you can sign in and ask those questions on the chat and we'll be able to relay those directly to all of our panelists. In terms of what we're looking forward to today, it's going to be a jam packed session.
00:02:37.738 - 00:03:24.966, Speaker B: There's a lot of stuff around coordination and how do we actually do things at scale, especially as we now lean more and more into how Dows are becoming so more involved in our day to days. So we're going to kick us off with Alicia talking about some social rules for Dows. We're going to have an amazing panel on how do we do better collective funding in web3. We're going to have Parker come on and talk about some of the threats and urgent calls to action on what we've seen, on how community, Dao and governance are evolving. Kaido is going to be talking about treasury management and how do we do that sustainably. We're going to have Tina talking about organizing communities, daphne will follow up with talking about how do we onboard more and more people through Dow participation. Ryan will be then covering culture, marketing and DAOs.
00:03:24.966 - 00:03:57.190, Speaker B: And then we're going to end the day with a history of coordination and kind of what we've learned from anywhere from science fiction to how we have evolved all of our processes today. So, eight amazing, incredible talks in coordination and how do we do this at scale. And to get right into it, I want to bring on our very first speaker for the day and that is Alicia and she's going to be talking about social rules for Dao. So without further ado, let's welcome Alicia and get the summit started. Hi Alicia.
00:03:57.610 - 00:04:02.860, Speaker C: Hi, how's it going? OK. Sorry I don't have video at the moment, but I'm just going to share my screen.
00:04:04.430 - 00:04:05.980, Speaker B: Everything is good to go.
00:04:06.350 - 00:04:07.194, Speaker A: Cool.
00:04:07.392 - 00:04:58.630, Speaker C: So. Hi, I'm Alicia ETH and I'm the governance lead at ENS. And over the last year or so, I have been working on launching the ENS Dao and then kind of facilitating putting in place infrastructure to allow the Dao to run. And in July this year, we kind of just hit the start of our second term. So we had been running a structure called Working Groups for six months and it kind of led me to reflect on the time since launch. And I ended up writing this piece, Social Rules for Dows. And I thought I could just run through this piece because social rules, I guess, are something that people tend not to really focus on or perhaps think about as an afterthought, especially if you are launching a token.
00:04:58.630 - 00:06:36.166, Speaker C: A lot of thought goes into everything that you need to do to launch, so related to token distribution, getting contracts set up and things like that. But what I really have spent most of my time doing since November last year is thinking about what happens once you launch a Dow and you have the mechanism to govern a project or a protocol through executable proposals that are done on chain by token holders. But a Dow is much more in terms of operating efficiently is much more than just getting token holders to vote. So ENS has kind of implemented a range of different social structures or social environments that kind of hopefully increase the efficiency and also help the Dao work towards its kind of north star of promoting the development and adoption of ENS. So I guess the starting point is what people think a Dao is. And so basically a Dow in its purest form is a collective group of token holders who use tokens to interact with the smart contract that can be used to govern a protocol and or manage a treasury. And so that's kind of the strictest definition of what a Dow is, which is that it's just essentially the smart contracts and then the token holders around that smart contract that vote.
00:06:36.166 - 00:07:52.020, Speaker C: But I guess over the last twelve months in particular, we've kind of come to think of Dowels as including all of the different social environments that kind of work alongside the Dow. And so that is kind of where actually a lot of, I guess, like, the culture and the action happens as it relates to a Dao because passing a proposal is quite straightforward. The ENS Dao uses tele, which a lot of other DAOs in the ethereum ecosystem do as well. And so that's one component. And kind of beyond that, I think it was important for me to be able to put in infrastructure that allowed the Dow to get to the point of passing proposals. And so thinking about that, just kind of zoom in on this image. Okay, so all of these different kind of components of the social environment of the ENS Dow kind of came to being at different points in the timeline in the last year or so.
00:07:52.020 - 00:09:10.650, Speaker C: And so I'll just quickly run through different things or different components of the social environment for ENS and the Dao. So there's snapshot, the governance forum, the constitution, we have Twitter, a governance process or proposal flow, working groups, working group rules and discord. So basically every community in web3 has a lot of these components, if not all of them. And I think potentially a thing that is different about the ENS Dow is that I guess I've been pretty aggressive in really formalizing a lot of the rules around some of these different aspects of the social environment. So I'll just quickly run through in terms of kind of what happened when we launched the dow. The ENS constitution was a really important part of our AirDrop strategy. And as part of the claim for the ENS token, people had to sign in and basically approve or reject each of the five articles to the constitution.
00:09:10.650 - 00:10:34.680, Speaker C: So this happened on snapshot. It means that ENS actually has, I think, the largest snapshot space on snapshot, if you go to snapshot.org. And the reason we did that is because we felt it was important to have the legitimacy of as many token holders as possible in terms of kind of affirming that constitution. The reason that's important is because ultimately with a social proposal, there is nothing kind of backing up a social proposal. It is really just people choosing essentially like opting in to adhere to those rules. And so, yeah, we actually had over 137 addresses eligible to claim and the constitution passed with 15 million votes out of, I think 25, maybe a bit less than 25 million approving the constitution. And I would say in terms of kind of the rank of importance of social rules within a dao, that a constitution, in my opinion, is perhaps the single most important kind of social rule that you can put in place in not only a dow, but potentially even like a community.
00:10:34.680 - 00:12:24.650, Speaker C: And it essentially provides a north star for every participant engaged in a dao, whether that is the delegates or community members or token holders who hold the ENS token and are delegating and the core team and participants in working groups. So a constitution just means that everyone, kind of irrespective of their background, their personal interests and kind of whatever their project interests might be, know that when they come to the ENS dao, what the goal is. And so something that's quite interesting. Just in the last actually, the last week and week and a half, we have had kind of a lot of discussion within the ENS community from people like Vitalik and Nick ETH, who is the founder of ENS, who have kind of raised suggestions that have been discussed on Twitter, and they actually kind of, if they were to be implemented, would be a breach of the constitution. So I had the tweet, but I don't have it at the moment, but essentially nick kind of tweeted about donating funds from objectionable ETH names to charities. And the reason that this would be kind of unconstitutional if it was implemented in the form that it was suggested is because it states in article three that income funds, ENS and other public goods. And so a donation to a charity outside of the scope of article three of the constitution is essentially a breach of the constitution.
00:12:24.650 - 00:12:42.990, Speaker C: And so that's just like a really tangible example of how something like a constitution as a document can be used in every day in practice to, I guess, keep the Dow aligned and heading in the direction that it was intended.
00:12:45.590 - 00:12:46.146, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:46.248 - 00:14:23.226, Speaker C: Another example is vitalik talking about implementing arbitrary taxes for ENS names or ETH names. And again, so in article two it says fees are primarily an incentive mechanism. And one of the statements that Vitalik made was that ENS was leaving money on the table and so there might be a better way to kind of capture that value. But article two of the constitution states that the intent is not to capture the maximum amount of value, it's just to disincentivize squatters and to ensure kind of that names have a better chance of being used. And so yeah, those are kind of two examples that we've just had literally in the last week of how the constitution has been really important and I would definitely recommend kind of thinking deeply about a constitution if you participate in a Dow and it doesn't have one. And another reason a constitution is really important is just because it empowers individuals who within the community, whether they might be delegates or stewards, to kind of make decisions that don't rely on kind of their personal assumptions. But objectively they can say based on what this grant is requesting, I can see that it is aligned with article three of the constitution.
00:14:23.226 - 00:15:37.574, Speaker C: Therefore the Dow should grant the funds to this project. So yeah, that is the constitution. And then another really kind of important part of the ENS Dao are the working groups. So if I just go back up here so working groups and working group rules. And the reason that I guess I kind of drafted working group rules for the ENS dao a month after the launch of the dao was because without some sort of structure, ultimately every proposal or vote needs to go to a dow wide vote. And this is a huge drain on the scarcest resource in crypto at least, which is attention. And so creating working groups was a way to allow the Dao to have, I guess, like these entities through which it could more effectively and efficiently carry out the objective of the Dao but not kind of burden delegates at the same time.
00:15:37.574 - 00:17:07.250, Speaker C: And so the working group rules are really expensive and we actually ended up asking snapshot to increase the word limit of snapshot proposals to accommodate the length of the working group rules. But basically within ENS there are three working groups meta governance, which relates to the dao ENS ecosystem, which relates to the maintenance and development of the ENS ecosystem and public goods because again, it kind of states in the constitution that funds from income funds ENS and other public goods. And so the constitution specifically states that public goods within web3 should be funded. And so those are the working groups. The working group rules were passed as a social proposal. And again, just like the Constitution, it means that the Dow could move forward and pass proposals without abiding to the social proposals which are the working group rules. But part of kind of building that culture within a Dow is I guess like people in positions of influence like stewards and large delegates kind of advocating to adhere to social rules.
00:17:07.250 - 00:19:13.514, Speaker C: And if you think about it, a lot of major decisions within a Dow kind of come down to whether or not everyone chooses to abide by social rules or not. And so the working groups were kind of created by having an election where the entire Dao was able to vote on electing stewards for each of the working groups and then it's this Dao wide election that gives working groups and their stewards the legitimacy to carry out and make decisions on their. So essentially what happened within the first six months is that there was an election, stewards were identified and elected and they passed a budget and things kind of got off to a really slow start. But this is, like, another important aspect of, I think, managing a dow and the benefit of social rules, which is that wastage is potentially, like, a really big issue in dows and so is potentially, like, self interested extraction. Of funds, particularly when there is no direction in terms of what the Dow should be doing or who is in a position to distribute funds and things like that. So I guess a win for the Dao. In my opinion, is that the difference between the first term, which was the first six months of the year, and the second term, which started in July, for the second six months of the year, the funding that the dow working groups received increased significantly from, I think, potentially like $400,000 across three working groups or four working groups when the first budget was passed to $3.5
00:19:13.514 - 00:20:22.450, Speaker C: million just recently. And I think the amount of funding that the working groups received recently is kind of a testament to how effectively the working group rules are working as a social structure within the ENSl. And I guess along with having rules like an important part of social rules is kind of iterating and experimenting. I think the hardest thing about something I think about often is that ENS is a protocol that we want to exist in 100 years, and dows are very new. And so balancing, I guess, like balancing doing the least risky thing possible to ensure the survival and longevity of the protocol while also having kind of some space to experiment. And iterate on things that have never been done before. And so with the working group rules we kind of iterated on that and they were repealed and replaced in June.
00:20:22.450 - 00:20:49.020, Speaker C: And yeah, I think that's the other thing with social rules is that they are more adaptable than executable rules which well, actually rules don't have to be executable but executable proposals, once they pass, it's kind of done. Whereas social rules, once they're in place, they can still be adapted. Okie dokie. And.
00:20:51.310 - 00:20:52.060, Speaker A: So.
00:20:55.090 - 00:21:58.686, Speaker C: And then within the social rules let's go back to the diagram. So within the social rules, there are working groups and the working group rules. Another important aspect of the Dow is the Governance Forum. And so the Governance Forum, I guess, is what a lot of people kind of associate with the Dao. And it's common for people who participate in a forum to feel like they are members of the Dao, even though that might legally be inaccurate. And for the ENS Dao, the Governance Forum is definitely kind of the heartbeat of the governance activity and there is a code of conduct. And what's interesting, I think about the Governance Forum is that it is like its own entity and something that I kind of think about as well in terms of what success might look like for the ENS.
00:21:58.686 - 00:23:25.754, Speaker C: Dao is having multiple governance forums and so like a diversity of different social environments, which means that depending on the breadth and the range of your community, you don't have to get every single person who is a user or involved in your project into the same governance forum based on whatever the requirements are of the executable vote. So for ENS there is a requirement that you have 100,000 ENS to post a vote on chain. And if you have that, then you can completely ignore essentially the social environment and just post a vote on chain. For that vote to pass, it needs a million votes to reach quorum and a majority of votes in favor of the proposal. So a lot of people, most people don't have 100,000 votes. And so they then rely on the Governance Forum and the associated proposal flow to be able to move proposals through the Dow. And something that is kind of interesting is that in the piece I actually say that the governance process is something that should be passed as a social rule really early on and we didn't do this with ENS.
00:23:25.754 - 00:24:19.600, Speaker C: And so the governance proposal flow was kind of documented in some governance docs, but it was never passed on snapshot by the Dow as a social proposal. And it's actually something I'm working on in the coming weeks. And I think in hindsight, the benefit of not passing that proposal immediately is that we have had the experience of putting through many proposals and kind of iterating on what the requirements and the thresholds are. But like I said earlier, the point of social proposals which are in their nature off chain because they're not executable, they don't relate to the protocol or the treasury, is that you can just put forward another proposal and change and iterate things. So I'm just going to quickly.
00:24:22.050 - 00:24:22.366, Speaker A: Get.
00:24:22.388 - 00:26:04.550, Speaker C: A time check because I don't want to go over just because I know that the lineup is jam packed, but okay, so yeah. So I think this diagram here kind of shows that if you think about the Dao in the center of a community and basically this social environment is what is currently the state of things for the ENS Dao. So a lot of these different components of the social environment are run or operated or administered by the core team. But the point of a dow is that we're kind of moving away from this idea that there is like a centralized organizational body that governs everything. And so, in my opinion, something that would kind of increase the antifragility of the ENS dow is for whether it's competing social environments or really niche and specific social environments to emerge from the community as a whole. That also participate that also view themselves as part of the dow kind of as we refer to it in web3, which kind of includes all of the social components. And I think that is kind of the win that I'm working towards with ENS personally.
00:26:04.550 - 00:27:41.380, Speaker C: And yeah, I guess the most important thing that I would kind of take away from social rules is that social rules and dows are more important and more flexible than most people realize. And I would say as well that potentially the format of the social rules matters and so having something like a constitution can kind of feel almost like you are setting up a legal system and that's kind of how I think about ENS, which is that it's a state and the social rules similar to legislation. I definitely would encourage people to think about all of the different kind of social environments that could be attached to their dow. And then I guess starting anywhere is a good place, but with a constitution is probably where I'd start, followed by a governance process and then kind of whatever social rules need to be put in place to manage the day to day operations of the Dao and its mission. But yeah, that's kind of been my experience. I'm still kind of learning every day and so hopefully I'll have something more to report in a couple of weeks or definitely in a few months. But yeah.
00:27:44.470 - 00:28:18.382, Speaker B: Amazing. Thank you so much Alicia. That was a really insightful kind of overview and hopefully this is one of those things where you get to report this in real time and we get to observe your learnings and how do we actually quickly adapt that to other communities. Amazing. Really appreciate this. And with that we are running a little bit late so we won't be able to do too much, too many questions. And if there are any questions from the audience, I'll just relay them directly to Alicia and share the responses with the person who asked them.
00:28:18.382 - 00:28:42.360, Speaker B: But I'm super excited to welcome our next talk and it's a panel we're going to talk about collective funding in Web Three. And as for our three amazing panelists, I want to welcome Simone, James, and Steph on to the stage. So I'll ask all of you to turn your videos on and we'll talk about some interesting ways to do funding. So welcome, everybody. Excited to have you on board.
00:28:42.810 - 00:28:43.560, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:28:44.570 - 00:29:15.470, Speaker B: Looks like we're awesome. So we have 30 minutes for this, which means we will go into too many questions. So we'll try to go into some direct topics as early as possible. But I want to kind of zoom out first and just maybe start off with a couple of intros. I'd love to kind of start with Simona here. Tell us about who you are, what you work on, and what is kind of the most common thing you end up doing as part of your role. And we'll kind of then go to Stefan and James.
00:29:16.450 - 00:29:18.240, Speaker C: Cool. Hi, everybody.
00:29:19.110 - 00:30:08.800, Speaker E: Great to be here. I tend to spin very many plates in the Ethereum Ecosystem. I am a steward of Gitcoin dao Meta governance. Steward for ENS. I also work with Element Finance Dow as well as organize Shelling Point and Liscon. So there's a plethora of things that I get involved in, all aimed at potentially creating or making sure that Web Three is our new reality and creating space for a lot of people to come into that reality in a nice, beautiful initiation and then a nice kind of path forward that everybody can benefit from.
00:30:11.990 - 00:30:14.530, Speaker B: Thanks. James, if you want to go next.
00:30:14.680 - 00:30:37.278, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So, hello, everyone. I'm James. I'm from FireEyes and from New Zealand. Really focus on sort of like, how we can open up the governance space and make it more approachable. And the best way that we do that is by working with a series of token launches and Dow launches at the moment at MCON. If anyone's listening at MCON, come and catch us and hang out, but sort of really like, focusing on how these DAOs can expand.
00:30:37.278 - 00:30:46.090, Speaker D: So how can Medicare bring in more people and give up more money? How can ENS and launch a token in a meaningful way and get other people involved?
00:30:47.570 - 00:30:51.680, Speaker B: Awesome. And steph. You're next.
00:30:52.530 - 00:31:19.510, Speaker F: Hey, I'm steph. I'm over at C Club. I am the steward of the media team. And yeah, I spend my days thinking about and executing and facilitating media as a Dao strategy. And, yeah, I think Jess, our instigator and co creator, described me as someone who thinks about coordination more than most same people. And I feel like that feels pretty accurate.
00:31:20.650 - 00:31:52.530, Speaker B: Amazing. This whole day is about coordination and sort of anywhere from our learnings to our complaints. So I want to focus on both of those for the next few minutes. I feel like the first topic we should all dive into is maybe talking about what is essentially the level of coordination we have to do. So, James, you talked about working with specific launches. Somebody talked about doing grants for multiple communities. Steph, you're talking about just kind of a lot of companies that you get to look at and the media aspects of all those opportunities.
00:31:52.530 - 00:32:12.680, Speaker B: These are different scales, these are different kind of timelines. You have a lot different set of people that are affected by these decisions, maybe starting with you steph on average, what is the level of complexity that you're dealing with in terms of the number of people you have to talk to or coordinate? And what are some of these timelines that you usually end up working out on?
00:32:13.050 - 00:33:57.610, Speaker F: I love this. We're increasingly our coordination is becoming more interwoven and complex over at C Club, both as our teams grow in the number of people that we're coordinating with and also the depth at which we're coordinating, and I think also as we mature as a Dow, as a community, as an organization. So, yeah, on any given day or sorry, on any given week, I'm in something like 14 plus hours of meetings that are scaled from either one to ones or syncs across multiple working groups or within our specific working groups. And yeah, we're working on timelines. So if I think about with the media team specifically, we're working on timelines that are both like 24 hours long, right, because you're engaging in the ever on cycle of Twitter, just social media, but we also work on much longer timelines, right? So when we're talking about any media that we're putting out from our podcast to any of our editorials, that can be timelines that are like two months, three months, six months out. One of the things that we're also in the midst of on the media team, but then again also at C club at large is the way in which as we grow our teams, as we grow and add new verticals to our work, that our coordination and our need for clarity and legibility and constantly surfacing all assumptions just becomes so critical.
00:33:59.550 - 00:34:11.920, Speaker B: I can imagine. And I feel like I don't want to go to Simona next because you seem to be in the eye of the storm of every Grant Dava coordination year. So what's the chaos that you get to deal with?
00:34:12.690 - 00:34:37.640, Speaker E: Well, so I think just in general and how this has potentially evolved, we're still dealing with incredibly, incredibly daris centralized and gigantic kind of decision making processes, right? And we're definitely at that stage where it's very important to become much more agile and to make sure that.
00:34:39.770 - 00:34:40.134, Speaker C: We.
00:34:40.172 - 00:35:35.354, Speaker E: Set ourselves up for collective decision making, right? And it's very important to decentralize that decision making process, and it's very important to prioritize enabling funding beyond what is a project and maybe have somebody who is good at marketing that project. Right? So this from the perspective of just an evolution of what it takes every single round for Gitcoin grants, the ones that go ahead are the ones that are just very good constantly on Twitter and doing the usual kind of pre during and post grant engagement, let's say. So I think there's work to be done, particularly on that decentralization piece and particularly on that merit base, like, really surfacing things in a much more natural way versus, again, a little bit of.
00:35:35.392 - 00:35:41.100, Speaker C: That centralization and flavor that we're trying to get away from.
00:35:41.790 - 00:35:57.086, Speaker B: No, absolutely. This actually is a good segue into what I was going to ask next. But I also want to give James a quick opportunity to talk about this because that is effectively what we're going to touch on and how do we actually make that scalable. So, James, I'll let you quickly chime in.
00:35:57.188 - 00:36:25.126, Speaker D: Yeah. I think plus one to what both Steph and Simona said, I think what's interesting at the moment in terms of how that coordination has leveled up, is that we're no longer sort of like coordinating ten people in a room. I mean, even with the Dow, right? Like, five years ago, there wasn't that many people. There was a shitload of ethereum, right? Like 1015 percent of all ethereum. But in terms of humans sitting around the table, there wasn't that many. And then sort of PTSD for a couple of years. Now we have sort of then MetaCartel and mock spin up.
00:36:25.126 - 00:36:44.080, Speaker D: A few more people come, and then now it's like the hot word, right? It's the buzword that literally everyone trying to get into. Seed club is like, oh, I'm a Dow. I'm an amazing dow. It's awesome. I think we are now at a space where it's a buzword, right, which is really good in a lot of ways because it means we have more humans, but it also means we have these coordination challenges that I guess like we're talking about right now.
00:36:45.970 - 00:37:33.534, Speaker B: Absolutely. It seems like there's one interesting thing here, is we often end up with not establishing which side we're kind of talking about, because oftentimes we have to switch context from, hey, we're on the other side of the people we're actually helping. And then sometimes, let's talk about the work we have to do to get to those outcomes. And each of you are in that position where you're doing something on the internal side, and then you have external facing sort of outcomes. When you kind of look at that, what are some of the common challenges that you feel like you've seen or you think are still largely unsolved on the internal side? I'll maybe kind of start with you, James. Like, you have to kind of work with people on the launch side of things as they kind of think about new tokens. How often are those not how often.
00:37:33.534 - 00:37:44.546, Speaker B: What are usually kind of the common things you run into that repeat every time you talk to a new set of kind of clients? And then we'll kind of go to Simulina about some of the grants and the Dows you're involved with.
00:37:44.728 - 00:38:25.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's interesting. I think one of the most common things. Is probably not knowing when they should turn into a dow. And I think the coordination of there now being 10,000 people, 100,000 people that really care about Dows, I think sort of adds to that complexity. Because at the beginning, it's like, oh, well, we'll just turn into a dow, and no one might worry about it for too long, but eventually we can sort of build on something more meaningful. Versus now it's like, okay, well, we can turn into a Dow right now, and there might be 10,000 people banging our drum, but do we need that? Like, should we do that right now? And so I think, like a common thing, we end up talking to a lot of different companies and a lot of them are like, okay, let's turn into a dow tomorrow. And either they're trying to rush it too much and then it's chill the fuck out.
00:38:25.694 - 00:38:50.470, Speaker D: Sorry, I don't know if we're, like, swear chill out and sort of take it a little bit easier or they're so scared, right? There's actually a lot of companies that we've spent a lot of time working with that we all use on a daily basis that were planning to launch a token years ago and didn't and went through months or years of work around launching that and then went, okay, this is too scary. There's too much going on. And so I think that's sort of one of the most common things that we end up finding.
00:38:54.410 - 00:38:55.498, Speaker B: Go for it.
00:38:55.664 - 00:39:57.626, Speaker E: So I think that's really interesting. And actually my kind of take on things was around timing as well. So I think that is such an important piece that we either and it seems like there's that speed of rushing in or pulling back and that in between that really nice middle is still something that we're all trying to figure out, right? It's either super quick, let's get all of the dow tooling immediately, even if we don't need it right now, and let's figure things out later, or let's wait, let's see, maybe we don't turn into a dow. Maybe we don't launch that token. Maybe we do this or think about it a little more. And I think the timing piece is really important both in the workings because you mentioned the internal workings of a dow, establishing those patterns. I've been chatting about patterns and cadence and all of these rhythms of how things evolve, of how information flows, of how processes get implemented to make sense for that organism.
00:39:57.626 - 00:40:54.960, Speaker E: If you look at it all, it's all each dow or each structure is an organism within itself. Everything has to flow in a healthy way. Everything has to touch the different components and the different parts through the arteries that link everything together and making sure that that functions. That's a very important piece internally. On the other side, when you're looking at funding, when you're looking at how people are coming in and how they're accessing resource, being able to do it in a grassroots way, being able to do it in a way that has such a better degree of visibility versus the big institutional funders, the monolithic institutional funders that, dare I say, they also follow patterns. But that's because they kind of go on a surface level sometimes. That a grassroots approach just completely.
00:40:56.770 - 00:40:57.134, Speaker C: Not.
00:40:57.172 - 00:41:24.060, Speaker E: Necessarily goes against, but gives you that granularity and gives you that feel for true value for an ecosystem that you may not have insights into. And so, again, micro to macro, macro to micro, it's not that different from the natural world and plants and all of these beautiful natural things if we just approach it from that perspective. A lot of things become a lot clearer in timing as well as.
00:41:26.910 - 00:41:38.990, Speaker B: Steph. Your day to day is a little bit different than James and Simone is in kind of the role. What are kind of some of the parallels you've seen on the process side of things for C Club?
00:41:39.650 - 00:42:07.094, Speaker F: Yeah, I love how you're just getting to the heart of the matter, right? What is the tension between how we're integrating process internally and then how that then bleeds out into external and then also when we're interfacing with projects or with applicants for the accelerator or mean? I think I think that there's a lot of things that feel resonant in what both James and Simona said.
00:42:07.132 - 00:42:07.720, Speaker A: And.
00:42:10.090 - 00:43:26.670, Speaker F: When we're thinking about coordination, I think there's a way that we as a space talk about how we coordinate a community or how we make decisions as a community around a shared treasury. And one of the things I've noticed, and I feel like we're bringing more attention to at C Club as well, is like, oh, actually, there's already a really core community here and those are your core contributors. And so how are we as a contributing team, both within our specific working groups and also across our working groups, how are we coordinating and how are we making decisions? And then also, how are we memorializing those processes? And then to Simone's point about cadence, how are we integrating a sense of cadence and evaluation and retro to all of those processes? That stuff's just not super sexy. When I said earlier, yeah, I'm in 13 hours of meetings a week. It's like, yeah, that's not a super exciting stat, but what happens in those meetings is actually really powerful. Like the power of a 30 minutes one to one. And what can be accomplished in terms of connection and coordination in this off chain way is actually really critical to then bringing that coordination to on chain and then also how we accelerate that coordination for the DAOs that come through Seed Club.
00:43:28.290 - 00:43:49.640, Speaker B: So does this mean that you're essentially focused on decentralized decision making, but from a process standpoint, what matters is still kind of behaving like any coordinated community would, which largely resembles a centralized, sort of controlled kind of party. Is that a fair question to either of you?
00:43:51.610 - 00:44:29.986, Speaker F: Yeah, I guess I'll take the first pass at that. Yeah. I think that we think about decentralization. I think it's very easy for us to say decentralization on the other side of that is centralization. And I think that that's actually not a super useful way to think about decentralization, right, that it can be this circular spectrum with hella gradients. And there are certain things within your Dow, within your community that might be fully decentralized, whatever that actually means. And there are certain components that have higher touch or more sort of quality control or curation or quality assurance or curation that those processes go through.
00:44:29.986 - 00:44:40.760, Speaker F: And I don't necessarily see that as centralization, so to say, but I do see it as a really actually critical part of having a fully aligned, decentralized community.
00:44:42.250 - 00:44:43.286, Speaker D: I'm down to go.
00:44:43.308 - 00:44:45.814, Speaker C: Simone I was going to say for.
00:44:45.852 - 00:45:58.350, Speaker E: Sure with the gradients, I mean, it's the way we need to approach this whole thing because otherwise we're all going to lose our minds and go like, why are we not there yet? What the hell? So being like jumping straight from a way of doing things that works to a decentralized way, right? Like look at Grants, right? There's the decentralizing the grants protocol, right, and making that a tool for any community to use to fund whatever it is that they care about. That's the level of independence and decentralization that you aim for. But there's no way that you're going to be able to do it unless you would have gone through these, like, whatever, 15 grants rounds that Gitcoin has put up to see how it evolves and to see how it grows and to see how people are using it and what gets funded, right? So it's like that progressive way and path that you build. It's almost like, you know, those movies where the track isn't built yet, you're like, building it as the train is going is basically what we're doing. And that's totally fine and we should be comfortable with that and it's going to take a minute sometimes, but it is a progressive effort.
00:45:59.090 - 00:46:48.110, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. And I think that in current times, with whatever the number going down and Dows not executing as well as some people would like them to, I think there's this massive wave at the moment of people being like, oh, we should just go back. These corporate structures are actually really important. They're being emulated and these committees that are being spun up and some of that stuff is true and there certainly is learning from the corporate world and the idea of making a grants committee, right, and that being a centralizing force makes sense. But actually that doesn't mean we're taking a step away from the Dow stuff. And I think everyone's roasting tokens and roasting Dows right now, I think should take a step back and have a guess where we're going to be in five years and it's going to be that actually a lot of this corporate structure is being consumed by these Dows whether anyone likes it or not. And so the current Dow wave, yes, we are centralizing in some ways.
00:46:48.110 - 00:46:51.650, Speaker D: However, we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
00:46:52.310 - 00:47:27.520, Speaker E: The main thing there I would point out is adopting these things or making sure that we evolve this in a mindful way. Like don't just go oh shit, it's not working yet, let's just bring whatever it was from the corporate world and just jam it into the Dow ecosystem. Do it in a mindful way, take what makes sense, do not just move it as if you're like navigating I don't know, Europe with a map of the states and then you're getting frustrated that you can't find where you're just don't do that.
00:47:28.290 - 00:48:39.490, Speaker B: No, of course. I mean it's also one of those things where when you are changing kind of the recipe but rather actually you have different ingredients but a different recipe that you're trying to get or same recipe trying to get to you're. In a lot of those scenarios where I feel like the good thing here before I finish on is seems like all four of us are aligned on what each of us are saying. I don't disagree with anything that's been said so far, even though I would like to. But there are also some benefits of kind of being able to actually cherry pick things that are working and implement them in any new process and there are a lot of advantages of that. There's nothing wrong with having a meeting. There's still a range that you get to sort of realize that there's like diminishing returns that you kind of get to but kind of asking point blank do you think the Dows are efficient right now to kind of actually support a fast paced development of any kind of outcome? Obviously you can't generalize that but for the ones you represent, the ones you've seen do a good job or not a great job, what do you kind of think that generally trends as and what do you think there's room for improvement?
00:48:42.170 - 00:49:34.150, Speaker D: I'm happy to start. I think that compared to what I guess would be my thought is that yes, they are doing really well and certainly all the ones that every sale I'm involved in is perfectly efficient. But I think compared to what I think compared to what we were doing on the previous cycle which was raising tokens and having no community voice and then the founders just spending the money and then piecing out compared to that, yes, much more efficient. The Dow treasuries are locked up, the founder can't run away with the money. Well at least some of the situations the community are actually coordinating the thing is working and I think, yes, there's still a lot to be learned and yes, coordinating whether it be working groups or whether it be the way we distribute grants or the way that we coordinate decision making, all those things can be improved. But compared to any version of reality that's existed in crypto for the past couple of years, I think we're like winning massively.
00:49:36.090 - 00:50:58.046, Speaker E: 100%. And for me, the proof is genuinely in the proverbial pudding because you mentioned ingredients making recipes. But, for instance, in grants like season 14 of Gitcoin Dow, there was after because of the market and because of the different kind of circumstances, there was such scrutiny on how much money was coming out of the treasury. To fund what work that it went into this such valuable conversation and at times even disagreements within that community for the benefit of that dow and the work that it is doing right. And having those conversations like James. Says in an open forum, in a transparent way, in a very animated way, which for me was a pleasure to be able to be a part of and witness where you genuinely have people in a community caring about the future of something that can continue funding public goods and can continue its mission. And that opportunity, I don't know.
00:50:58.046 - 00:51:45.360, Speaker E: I have not witnessed it before. And just being able to be part of that and then create the processes that come out of that and making sure that you strengthen that and create the space for those conversations to exist and for that pattern of decision making, collective decision making to happen is huge. It's a milestone, as far as I'm concerned, in how we're moving them, how we're evolving them and how we're getting better and making sure that these things are clear, they are very accessible, they are very transparent in terms of the flows, in terms of who's involved, in terms of what we're doing with. So, yes, from me.
00:51:47.970 - 00:52:18.460, Speaker B: I want to maybe ask an adjacent question to steph kind of compared to what I would say a lot of what simona's in James day to day looks like you're investing in companies or DAOs and generally kind of you have a different way of thinking about how do you measure anywhere from success to track outcomes? What are kind of some of the perils you've seen from how you work at C Club versus what anywhere from like a venture capital firm would do or other Dow initiatives you've seen around?
00:52:19.630 - 00:53:13.146, Speaker F: Yeah, totally. I think a critical point there to just to clarify is that at C Club we don't invest in any Dow or community. The thing that we do offer though, through the accelerator is an investment of social value and then also knowledge acceleration. I think this question of efficient are Dows efficient at outputs? I think it's such a fascinating question. It feels like it's almost a holdover a little bit from from web two and from this idea of escape velocity and just like constantly up and to the right that it's true that we do need to be able to allocate this capital that we're able to pool really quickly because of this new technology. And I think that the real innovation actually does lie in how we allocate that capital. Right.
00:53:13.146 - 00:54:01.340, Speaker F: And so at Seed Club, the value or sort of the investment that we're able to offer is around that piece of innovation. It's like how are you actually thinking about allocating that capital to your community and bringing value back to your community? And then also what are the most innovative ways to build with your community and to create meaningful work together. It's a more quality level type of investment and it is very high touch. Right. And it's a little bit along the lines of do things that don't scale and do things that are actually going to be really aligned and produce something that's really of quality and also align with the ultimate value proposition of web3. Right. Which is the democratic opportunity for ownership of these networks that we're building.
00:54:02.430 - 00:54:02.794, Speaker G: No.
00:54:02.832 - 00:54:03.420, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:54:05.070 - 00:54:05.434, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:05.472 - 00:54:56.314, Speaker B: And I guess in that goal everybody is aligned because kind of compared to the alternative which you kind of talked about, there are no other avenues where you get the same opportunity and not even just the binary notion of having the opportunity, not but also at the scale which you don't get to sort of pursue. And that is definitely unique here and we're kind of figuring out how do we actually behave as individuals, whether it's representing the values to representing kind of the outcome. So, sounds like we need a second talk sometime in the future to figure out how do we actually track if we've been actually progressing or not. I do have a couple of smaller questions. I'll kind of start off by maybe asking each of you. There's about 1500 hackers, actually 1700 hackers for this event. They're building a lot of incredible tools for usually things that they're excited about.
00:54:56.314 - 00:55:11.186, Speaker B: But as you kind of go about your kind of day to days here, what are some of the missing things you've seen that would really benefit whether it's on the tooling side or processes side or just things that developers can do to help make your lives easier? What kind of comes to mind, I.
00:55:11.208 - 00:55:51.670, Speaker D: Think, well, maybe some alpha from MCON this week is that everyone is talking about verified credentials. And to me that's been the very clear end of governance from the beginning is you have this liquid token that anyone can buy and then you have these credentials that are slapped on top based on your expertise or how long you've been involved and that gives you more governance weight. Right. As far as I'm concerned, that's the end state of all tokens across the ecosystem. And I think it's been insane the level of buzword that verified credentials or whatever else we're going to call them has been this week. And I think that any builder listening or hanging out. Building around that topic I think is a very interesting space, which is basically sold out.
00:55:51.670 - 00:56:04.260, Speaker D: NFTs right. They're all the same thing. Non transferable Dow shares. It doesn't matter which way you spin it. The idea that your address can sort of have some reference which can be used inside of governance or other coordination efforts, very sick and going to become very important.
00:56:07.430 - 00:56:51.070, Speaker F: Yeah, something that I think about all the time, especially from the media end at C Club, but it also infiltrates. I think everything we do in Dow work is how can we actually communicate directly with our token holders? Whether that's an ERC 20 or an ERC 721, how can you actually get that direct connection to those token holders? And it seems like a very sticky and also slippery area of work. Right. Because you then get into this whole rabbit hole of just like, data. How you capture that data, how are you storing it and what are you doing with it? But I think that there is a real rich opportunity there to figure out how we can directly communicate and add value to the folks who hold tokens.
00:56:52.610 - 00:56:57.086, Speaker E: I actually think that was a project at East New York Cardika.
00:56:57.118 - 00:57:02.130, Speaker B: It was one of the final it's a recurring theme that I would say largely remains unsolved.
00:57:03.050 - 00:58:20.862, Speaker E: So that's a really good point and I think both of those it's really interesting to reflect on how much we've been playing with these things throughout the years. And now, finally we're getting two stages where potentially the tech is ready and the people are ready and the ideas are there to actually make them something that does provide value. Right? We've done this so many times, I remember there are so many different experiments that we were doing with reputation and that gives you this. And you can do this with if you have this token that's minted for this project and so on. I mean, God, I was doing this stuff in 2018 and people were like, what? But it's very important to look at, actually, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give a kind of bit of advice or a prompt for everybody building, I would say, elevate your intentions about what you're building. Don't just build something that is, I don't know, done before, or something that is buzzy or something that is on trend. Build something that you genuinely care about, that your community, the community that you come out of cares about.
00:58:20.862 - 00:58:53.560, Speaker E: Look at something that can generally make things better for whatever it is that you're interested in. And elevate that intention so that it does become something that moves us, that step further into what we're trying to do here, which is, dare I say, enable access to resource for everybody and redesign the little lines in the sand or in the cement that we have just been forced to live with for so long. That would be my kind of prompt for everybody.
00:58:55.230 - 00:59:10.926, Speaker B: Very timely and wise. All right, last question and we'll kick this off to the next talk. But how can people get involved in your community? I'll start with Steph with C club. What's the best way for people to find out and plug anything you'd like?
00:59:11.108 - 00:59:38.422, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, you know definitely of it. Follow us on all the socials right Twitter, get into our newsletter, find us on discord. Get in there, introduce yourself. And also if you're a dow builder, if you're a community builder, apply to the accelerator. We're just in the process of finalizing our next cohort for SEO five. But there will be an SEO six, there will be an SEO seven and onward. And we really want to see excited, new, innovative builders come through.
00:59:38.422 - 00:59:44.440, Speaker F: So we're at C Club HQ on Twitter and you can find us all the places from there.
00:59:46.330 - 01:00:26.870, Speaker D: James yeah, I'd say the best way to get involved is to participate in Wildfire, which the best way to do that is go to my Twitter and it's a pinned tweet blockchain. James and that's sort of a governance collective. There's 1000 OD people in the discord, but sort of fork key working groups focused on twelve OD, 13 OD different projects the likes of ENS that were speaking earlier. Optimism Seed Club is sort of lightly tied in. But there's actually a lot of opportunity here. And if you're keen to join any of these dows in any of these communities, whatever your skill sets are, go into the discord and just spam them and start adding value and you will be onboarded. Know, hit me up on Twitter and say, hey, I'm doing something cool and I'm not getting free tokens and I'll abuse.
01:00:26.870 - 01:00:29.320, Speaker D: Thanks guys.
01:00:31.050 - 01:01:10.578, Speaker E: And kind of same pattern. Twitter has all of the handles of all of the different things. I'm just at SIM underscore Pop. One of the main things that I would say, check out kernel. They have very good cohorts of onboarding into web3 for individuals and teams. It's a great program. It's that initiation that kind of leads you through learning about web3, but also from a very principles aligned way, which because I mentioned elevate intentions that ensures that you'll learn about things like in a in a very good way, obviously.
01:01:10.578 - 01:01:22.118, Speaker E: Gitcoin there's a link there. Get into the discord. There's so many different working work streams. There's so many interesting things that those guys are doing and then, yeah, everything's in there.
01:01:22.284 - 01:01:23.874, Speaker C: So, yeah, good luck.
01:01:23.922 - 01:01:32.074, Speaker B: Thank you for thank you, simona james and Steph and I really appreciate you going over and having this amazing conversation with us.
01:01:32.192 - 01:01:33.446, Speaker F: Thanks, Kartik. Thanks, James.
01:01:33.478 - 01:01:34.134, Speaker D: Thanks, Karthik.
01:01:34.182 - 01:01:34.794, Speaker C: See you.
01:01:34.912 - 01:01:35.674, Speaker B: See everybody.
01:01:35.792 - 01:01:36.490, Speaker G: Bye.
01:01:38.590 - 01:01:58.580, Speaker B: All right, we are ready for our next talk. And this is going to be an exciting one. We're going to talk about some urgent calls to actions on how do we think about the evolution of Dows communities and governance in Web Three and want to welcome our speaker Parker to get us started and appreciate you waiting. Welcome.
01:02:01.030 - 01:02:05.990, Speaker A: Hi. Super happy to be here. I have something to screen share today.
01:02:06.140 - 01:02:07.160, Speaker C: Go for it.
01:02:07.530 - 01:02:09.640, Speaker A: Amazing. Cool.
01:02:20.490 - 01:02:22.698, Speaker B: You can see everything and you're good to go.
01:02:22.864 - 01:02:40.980, Speaker A: Great. Sorry. Trying to figure out how to present it's. A little hard to see. I guess we can just leave it like this if you guys are able to see her slideshow. Perfect. Great.
01:02:40.980 - 01:03:23.962, Speaker A: Starting off with a quick intro. Super happy to be here today. I'm Parker. I'm very involved in the Crypto space across a few different contexts. I'm on the founding team of Boys Club, which is a social club community and Dow working to welcome women and nonbinary individuals into Web Three. You can check us out on Twitter at Boys Club crypto. I'm Also working as an early stage investor in Crypto startups at Fintech Collective on their DeFi fund and specifically work there with our Founders one on one to help them build skill and design their communities.
01:03:23.962 - 01:04:14.270, Speaker A: So everything from pre launch to Even, like, communities and protocols later on, the appdow is helping them rethink their governance structures, et cetera. So today, what am I going to be talking about? I have a Lot of thoughts and feelings and ideas around how we can be doing better in sort of the frameworks and assumptions that we are approaching Dow's community and governance around. So this is going to be pretty high level. I'm aware that we only have about 30 minutes here. I don't know if we have a timer, but for the mods, definitely let me know when we get to like ten minutes, if that's okay with you. To kick things off, I want to talk about Dows. Great.
01:04:14.270 - 01:04:50.554, Speaker A: Thanks. So Dows have gotten huge, right? Like we're seeing new Dows spawn up every day. We're seeing web. Two companies want to make dows. At least I'm seeing this in my work as a VC. Also a lot of founders will pitch their startup, will pitch their product and mention that they're also creating a dow. This, to me, is Sometimes like, a little bit of a jarring statement, because Dows Are such a Huge project, right? They're almost like starting a second startup, I think, if you're Doing it right.
01:04:50.554 - 01:05:30.040, Speaker A: And so dows as a concept have gotten huge even though they're so new. But they're still failing massively in Several ways, right? They're failing to get off the ground. We're Seeing Classic coordination failures, low participation, low engagement. And even when success Is found, dows are imploding, right? We Could Point to some of MakerDAO's recent struggles with governance. I don't think Maker is a failure. But they are facing some struggles so big. Established Dows that are sort of the name of the game, even are Encountering A Lot of issues.
01:05:30.040 - 01:06:28.638, Speaker A: And so where are we really Going wrong here? I think there's a few things that I'd like to draw our attention to here today. I think a lot of Dow Building or sort of thinking around Dow Building that I'm seeing Today focus on Outcome rather than need or rather than demand. So we're Seeing a Lot of people that want to Spin Up Dows that Have Ideas for Dows but don't have the actual community or participants to start with. We're also seeing a lack of intrinsically motivated participants within Dows. Right. So we're Seeing a Lot of Dows that have a Lot of members, a Lot Of Participants, but not a Lot of participation and not a Lot of engagement, especially long term. And then we're seeing a lot of out of the box composition, right? So lots of doubt tooling startups that are just like, easily spin up your own doubt.
01:06:28.638 - 01:07:27.998, Speaker A: No hit on that. But I think there is a little bit of lack of Nuance in some of the Dows that are being created, right? So not fully thinking through all of the design pieces that make up a Dow and that will greatly affect how the Dow operates in the future or maybe not even knowing what those pieces are really that need a lot of thoughtful consideration. So what are Some Things that we could do or some Frameworks we could use to try to approach some of these Issues that I just mentioned? I think first, validating demand, right? Startups, one to one product, one to one. Same for Dows, same for community building. I'm a firm believer that community should come before the Dow. Once Again, we're Seeing a lot of people who want to Create Dows and are Looking to find the Community to fit into the Dow After. I don't think that works.
01:07:27.998 - 01:07:35.502, Speaker A: I think you need a Community that a Dow will only bring value to.
01:07:35.556 - 01:07:35.870, Speaker F: Right?
01:07:35.940 - 01:07:53.470, Speaker A: So another important thing here would be asking, why are we even creating a dow? Do we need a dow for this use case or for this community? Or is the Motivation to Create one maybe motivated by a bid for relevancy?
01:07:53.550 - 01:07:53.842, Speaker F: Right?
01:07:53.896 - 01:09:12.314, Speaker A: Trying to stay relevant or trying to follow the buz? This is a hard question to answer and it takes a lot of I don't think you can even answer it right away. It takes a Lot of thoughtful consideration, writing, talking to other people to really understand why do we need A Dow? Why are we doing this for Boys Club? We're creating a dao to enhance what's already working really well within boys club, right? Which is a lot of participation, a Lot of different ideas, a lot of different segments and pockets of our community that want to spin up different things. So the Dao structure, which we're still iterating on, we're still taking very Slowly. The Dow Structure, Though, allows us to super efficiently, or at least more efficiently than before, streamline ideas from the idea Stage into actual execution and allows us to make sure that. There's not as much imbalance of power or say in the dictation of where the community goes in the future. Optimizing for sustainability over speed would be a second one. Again, I think we're seeing a lot of out of the box solutions people that promise use this toolkit.
01:09:12.314 - 01:09:50.380, Speaker A: Spin up your dao in a few days, in a week we'll get everything set up. I think that dao should take a very slow approach. I'm very bullish on experimentation and iteration and also research. So when Boyz Club was founded, I immediately knew the dow aspect is what I wanted to kind of focus on and it's been like eight or nine months since then. The dow is not done. And I was expecting this to be maybe like a three to four month process. But after three or four months I was not even done with the research phase of the process of dow building.
01:09:50.380 - 01:11:20.630, Speaker A: And this is because I wanted to really there's so much information about dows, there's so many different ways to create them. We also don't have a current body of literature, formalized body of literature around dows and dow building. So there's a lot of personal initiative research that you have to do and I think sustainability is really important, right? So when you think about your community and how to build a dow that's sustainable for them, I think it's best to really take it slow. Right? Test and iterate these processes before you decide to implement them and test and iterate many different processes before you decide to implement them. With this comes like a willingness to look beyond traditional methods out of the box solutions and maybe people who want you to build your dow with them in a week might suggest the most traditional or widely accepted methods for participation. Streams for governance design for Token model or tokenomic model? I strongly believe that every dow is different and needs a different thing. Just like every person has different preferences in personal taste, personal style, in what works best for them and what's best for them in health and in their diet and in their workout routine.
01:11:20.630 - 01:12:21.098, Speaker A: Dows are similarly different and the communities are similarly different and need different things. So yeah, I sort of think about dow building in a very nerdy way, almost kind of like a science experiment. There's all these different variables and all these different things that have to fit together in factors that influence each other to drive the outcome of the experiment and there's many different things that you have to sort of fine tune within that experiment to make it right. Moving on to dow governance, lots of thoughts here. I'm going to give a very high level overview. So I think the current mental model of governance in dows generally in the space today is token or coin voting. So this would be like when I buy a token, for example, I have governance rights is how it works.
01:12:21.098 - 01:13:11.190, Speaker A: In dows, like maker other dows where there's no kind of opt into governance. It's just like when you have a token, you are automatically eligible to participate. I think we're also seeing a lot of proven failures with this system though, right? So even Metallic recently published a piece against token voting and sort of providing some alternative ideas around it. But it's still the most widely accepted and thought of governance mechanism in this space today, at least as I see it. So I'm seeing recently, like, a lot of rejection of dows and a lot of rejection of governance. A lot of people on crypto Twitter are saying dows don't work, DAOs don't work as a business model. They're a failure, it's proven.
01:13:11.190 - 01:14:15.120, Speaker A: And I'm like, no guys, token voting is maybe not a proven failure, but not working. And that's the thing that's the similarity across these dows that you're pointing to as examples, right? So I think we have an urgent call to action to explore other kinds of governance mechanisms and really focus more resources on experimentation, research, and just like, iteration on alternative and emergent forms of governance. One I'm really excited about is conviction voting, which is sort of a mechanism of staking your vote, gaining more power over time or weight over time. And I think we need governance mechanisms that really capture more of the dynamic nature of humans. So, like a snapshot voting proposal works, right? But new information is revealed over time.
01:14:15.730 - 01:14:16.382, Speaker C: Ten minutes.
01:14:16.436 - 01:15:28.390, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. New information is revealed over time, human change over time, their opinions change over time. So that should be able, in my opinion, to be reflected within governance decisions. And I'm like, where is the disconnect, right? There's actually a lot of really great peer reviewed research, academic research on emergent forms of governance and on some of the ways in which current mechanisms of governance are failing. But these don't have widespread attention in crypto. So there is this disconnect, and I'm wondering, how can we work to begin to not only continue exploring alternate mechanisms of governance, but also begin to change and shift the mental models of governance within the Crypto community to see governance as this plethora of options and also as this completely unexplored and open design space that still exists, rather than accepting governance and dow governance as something that's failing currently. So I could get into community.
01:15:28.390 - 01:15:43.340, Speaker A: It's something I talk about a lot. I have lots of thoughts here as well, but I guess I don't know if the chat is open. I do want to pause and open to any questions so far. Is that possible?
01:15:46.930 - 01:15:55.150, Speaker B: We'll source in anything that comes in from the attendees, but in the meantime, you can kind of continue with the rest of the slides.
01:15:55.730 - 01:16:54.130, Speaker A: Awesome. Great. Community, like a very nebulous word and one that's thrown on a lot. So community is not fluff. Let's get this straight, community is crucial, especially in crypto, right? In a bear market in tough times, what is holding your protocol up? Right? If you have a token, you need that price up, right? And so your community is going to be the one powering that but I think community goes way beyond just financial incentive as well. There's a lot of big brain energy entering the crypto community space and I think we're really beginning to see how sticky community is. And community, if done right, can be an absolute leverage for every aspect of your business and every aspect of what you're building, right? These are your evangelists, these are owners, these are people that will be contributing in the future and providing you feedback.
01:16:54.130 - 01:17:29.180, Speaker A: But I think too many in the space currently mistake community for marketing. And I think sometimes community is marketing and that's great and there is some crossover, right? But it's not always marketing. And I think it's a fatal flaw to view community as marketing. Here's why I also think it's kind of cringe. Here's why. Marketing is all about capturing users and getting your brand out there. And community inherently, if it's successful, will work as a marketing engine.
01:17:29.180 - 01:18:39.650, Speaker A: But if you treat community like marketing, when you're first trying to think about how to build it and how to sustain it, it's never going to work because you're going to need to see community as an ecosystem, right? It's ever evolving and it's ground up. So you need a sustainable foundation in order to build a community. That in turn can be a marketing engine for you. And I think there's like a several step process here which I'll just briefly sort of walk through and how I think about community building both at Boys Club and when I'm working with some of my portfolio companies at Fintech Collective. So I think the first step is defining what you are, what is your community about, and also what is it not about? What do you stand for, what do you not stand for? And I think getting as niche as possible here is really helpful. Once you understand what you're all about, what your community is all about, and what you want people to get from it and take away from it and learn from it, you need to attract those members. So, like, top of funnel awareness, right? And once you have sort of like had those first community members trickle in, you want to activate them.
01:18:39.650 - 01:19:35.510, Speaker A: Sorry, this should say activate. So start finding ways to get them comfortable, get them involved, have them introduce themselves, make sure they have all the resources they need to succeed and be able to navigate the community and all the things that it provides. And then you'll start to see people who actively want to get more involved. Maybe they'll pitch in with ideas, maybe they'll have feedback, maybe they'll come to you one on one and you want to harness that power because that is like magical energy and there is a special window of time that you need to capture that energy within. So then involving them, right, giving them more responsibility, maybe Azure Community skills, they can take notes on community calls. They can jump in to moderate, finding ways to give them more responsibility and finally giving them responsibility and opportunity for ownership. So enabling ownership.
01:19:35.510 - 01:20:24.230, Speaker A: And I think, I guess, to close out this sort of high level segment here, a lot of companies that I work with, when we start working together, immediately say we want to optimize for ownership and building our community. But I think one thing that's too often overlooked is all of the steps that it takes to set up ownership. And it's almost like that meme of the guy with the domino and the many dominoes. You need to first know what your community is about, then attract those members, then activate them, then involve them to enable sustainable ownership, in my experience. So, yeah, I think that's pretty much it for me. But if there are any questions, happy to answer them. I can go deeper into any of these subjects.
01:20:24.230 - 01:20:40.074, Speaker A: But, yeah, I'm at Parker Jayp on Twitter. If you want to chat, follow me. DM me. I'm around. Yeah. And super happy to be here. So thank you so much, guys, for having me.
01:20:40.192 - 01:21:34.666, Speaker B: Thanks, Parker. No, that was very insightful and also a little bit spicy, I think. Just some good direct and actionable things that we can talk about. Maybe my kind of first question would be rather, how do you differentiate between knowing what to do and sort of how do we get there? You kind of talked about a lot of things that you've seen firsthand not work as well as either people think or you yourself thought they would. Is this largely a mindset thing? Is this largely a tooling issue? Is this largely something that we have to kind of instill at the beginning? At what point of the process of a lifetime of a member joining a community do these things need to be addressed? And sort of how would you kind of think about backtracking and implementing where these things should be actually put in?
01:21:34.848 - 01:22:26.230, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. So, obviously, I take a very methodological approach to community building, and I don't think that's bad. And I think sometimes people are a little bit shy to take kind of almost like, strategic approach. But I do think there are ways to activate a community, and it's not necessarily extractive. I think just keeping these things in mind throughout the process, I think it is sort of a framework and I wouldn't say mindset, but more of a framework that can be reevaluated over time. So at any point in the process, even if you already have a community and you've had one for two years and never even thought about this, you can still sort of walk through this and think through this and look for the sort of user journey or pipeline within your community. And I don't think it's a one size fits all approach.
01:22:26.230 - 01:22:45.620, Speaker A: The way that certain communities might work to attract their members or define what they're about might be different from others, and that's okay. But it's sort of like the general idea and just hitting those steps, making sure they're accounted for that I think it's important. Does that answer your question?
01:22:46.230 - 01:23:15.930, Speaker B: It definitely does. And maybe one kind of other follow up would be do you think there are not do you think I guess what are some examples that others should shamelessly steal from? Like, who do you have have you seen has done a really good job at implementing some of the changes that you proposed, in addition to, obviously kind of a view, but what are some of the nice ways to kind of understand if this is working in practice and kind of contrasting with the alternatives?
01:23:16.430 - 01:24:13.454, Speaker A: Sure, that's a great question. I think there are a lot of great committees out there that are each doing have strengths in different ways. I don't think there's anyone that's nailed this down perfectly. And that also is just inherent to the fact that communities are ever changing and their needs are ever changing. I really admire some of the work actually done by a woman not in the Web Three space, but named Priyanka Parker. So I read her book, The Art of Gathering, which actually focuses on in real life events and community building in real life. And I love the way that she broke down almost like literally the Art of gathering and bringing people together in a very thoughtful and strategic way.
01:24:13.454 - 01:25:13.380, Speaker A: And the way that I talked about dow building, community building as an experiment, I saw her view gathering as an experiment. So she lays out all of these different almost like, experiments that she's done about the amount of people that you bring in and what kind of atmosphere that creates intention, setting explicitly before the event, how to make people feel comfortable, methodologies, literally, that she's refined and composed and put together in different ways. So that thinking I really love. And yeah, again, so many great communities out there. Mochi Game has done a great job of world building. I think that's something I should have put in this presentation. But world building is like an essential aspect of community in my mind, and Mochi has done a beautiful, illustrative, magical job of that.
01:25:13.380 - 01:25:33.480, Speaker A: The govern community is great. Erin step on are great. They're constantly iterating like we're working with them and they're constantly coming to us with feedback questions. I love the thoughtful and long term approach that they take. Yeah, so many communities I could gosh about.
01:25:35.130 - 01:25:56.240, Speaker B: Great. We have another question from the audience, which is, what are your thoughts on proven corporate structure? And kind of do you think if somebody found a way to easily merge those kind of proven ways to behave or operate at scale with kind of that formations? Would that actually make things easier or do you kind of reject some of those existing things?
01:25:57.410 - 01:26:57.918, Speaker A: That's a great question. Okay, so I guess to answer that, I'll say first of all, I'm taking my own opinion here with a grain of salt. There's actually a book that I just ordered on Amazon to read about this and it goes over this thing called the Teal Structure that I read about in Rook Protocols. Let's see if I can put this in the chat. I really loved the way that I was reading this and I love the way that they were thinking about I just put it in the chat community building. So they think about it as almost very similar to Orca protocol love orca love the Orca community by the way, as well, but like modular and delegated decision making. But they borrow at least within protocol documentation, this corporate kind of method of the Teal Structure.
01:26:57.918 - 01:27:19.290, Speaker A: I need to read more about it. Which is why I ordered the book that they cited it from. But I think it could sound actually when I read it, I was like, this sounds a lot like what we're doing in Boys Club. I didn't even know that this existed. Right. So I don't know, it could work. I think there are proven things that work in corporate structures.
01:27:19.290 - 01:27:36.734, Speaker A: I personally have been more involved in the startup kind of world. So I don't really come from that experience. But yeah, why not, I guess. But again, I think every Dow and community is different. I don't think a corporate structure would be the best for everyone.
01:27:36.932 - 01:27:46.498, Speaker B: Absolutely. And our last question, which interestingly comes from our next speaker, and that is do you think tokens help with community building?
01:27:46.664 - 01:28:37.460, Speaker A: No, I don't. And I think it's really concerning when people think that it does. So let me just quickly explain my thinking here. I think it's a fatal flaw. I think it's a fatal flaw to use a Token as a way to try to bolster either marketing, brand awareness, relevancy brand exposure, or community building and community activity. I am of the personal belief, not reflective of my organization with Boys Club or like my firm, but of personal belief that you should wait as long as you can to launch a token. I think finding Product Market Fit really hard, building a successful, sustainable, active community really hard.
01:28:37.460 - 01:29:34.120, Speaker A: Launching a token really hard. And that should come after you've found Product Market Fit and after you have a community. And that's because the token relies on those other things as well. So to set the token up for success, you need to have the most solid foundation possible. And I think we've seen across the board also there's examples of this, right? Like communities and projects and protocols and companies that launch a Token when they're first starting out or launch a Token to help the product are usually literally just go on coin market cap and look through. No, I don't think Tokens help community building, but I do think if there is a successful, sustainable, strong community and a Token is launched, those should work to reinforce each other as a flywheel so they can help each other but from incentive. Yeah.
01:29:34.650 - 01:29:45.530, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for that amazing talk and going into all those questions. Really appreciate taking the time. And with that, we are ready for our next speaker.
01:29:46.430 - 01:29:49.114, Speaker A: Thank you guys so much. Have a great day.
01:29:49.232 - 01:30:00.750, Speaker B: You too. All right, next up we have Kaido talking about how do we better use tools to measure our large treasuries. So without further ado, let's welcome Kaido.
01:30:02.690 - 01:30:16.434, Speaker G: Hi. Hi, Karthik. Thank you for inviting me back again. It's great to be here, but it's going to be hard. Let me share my screen really quick. All right. Does this look good to you guys?
01:30:16.552 - 01:30:17.778, Speaker B: The thing is good.
01:30:17.944 - 01:31:04.770, Speaker G: All right, perfect. So today I'm talking about treasury and then the general sustainability of Dows, specifically from a treasury standpoint, I know I'm talking at a hackathon, so I want to in the end inspire people to build different things. This is a talk I give in May before the crashes happen. So I hope there's some updates here and then some lessons I've learned definitely along the way. And some updates, as in some project I've mentioned in the past, have decided to cease their business and go elsewhere. So it could be some interesting things to look through their journeys and see how we can learn from there. All right, before I begin, I want to give a quick TLDR about myself, why I'm interested in this different work and why you should listen to me.
01:31:04.770 - 01:31:59.486, Speaker G: So right now I work at Incentive Design, Llama and Gitcoin, and my work encompass from governance design Tokenomics to Liquidity management. My goal is to in the end help DAOs to achieve their vision in this very cyclical crypto market. And at Llama we built economic infrastructure for DAOs. And here are some projects we've worked in the past. Previously, when I first started in crypto, I was with Trader Joe's, which is a Dex on avalanche, and I was there working on token incentive to help different projects liquidity. And Trader Joe started when I was right here. So when I first joined, Trader Joe had around 40, 50 million TVL, and when I left, we had about 1 billion TVL.
01:31:59.486 - 01:33:02.054, Speaker G: And also in my free time, I start writing different design pieces on how do we think about different token incentives and how can we build sustainable business structures with tokens. And this main interest of me basically sparred off my time at Trader Joe, where I saw numerous projects blow up overnight and then slowly die out very quickly because they didn't have a robust incentive structure or even a product. So I hope through my time at Trader Joe all the learning lessons I could share with you guys through this talk and think about how do we build different projects that can help Dow sustain further. And this is a design I did with FWB to help there with their liquidity design. So let's start with the goals for the talk. So number one is I'll give you the nuts and boats for what is the Protocol Treasury and why should I build on top of it. I give the talk last May.
01:33:02.054 - 01:33:30.622, Speaker G: A lot of people have thought about it, it was great. I want more people to building on top of it. Think about sustainable Dow development. Second thing is what are the current solutions? Before you build anything, you want to look at what other people are doing and how should we innovate on top of it. Lastly is of course what can you build and in the end I hope this is a fun and actionable talk. In the end. After hearing the talk I hope there's some ideas flowing around.
01:33:30.622 - 01:34:21.490, Speaker G: Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter. I'm always happy to talk to different folks and help you on your journey. So first what is Protocol Treasury and what is the problem? Protocol treasury by definition is just assets owned by the protocol for future development. The common usage of treasury assets can be split into three different categories. This is my definition from personal experience. Number one is grant programs and the goal of grand program is to incentivize people to build on top of your own protocol because crypto by nature is open source and everyone can view it and becomes posable and build on top of each other. Grant program is really important to build a strong developer, ecosystem or even product suite around your core protocol.
01:34:21.490 - 01:35:08.682, Speaker G: Second is ecosystem building. This is specifically talking about partnership with other protocols. This can be achieved through many levels. But the main one maybe we have experimented the most with is token swaps to try to align financial incentive to further or even deepen relationship between protocols. Lastly is very underlooked, which is budgets. I think that the main use of treasury nowadays is for budgeting and budgeting by definition is to cover the cost of operations, salaries, marketing events and outreach for protocols to grow. And what is the problem here? So the opportunity spacing in Protocol Treasury is gigantic.
01:35:08.682 - 01:36:07.762, Speaker G: Currently there's $9.5 billion in Protocol Treasury and it has increased more than ten X in the past ten months. And very interesting enough, what we saw is that even though my last deck was May, which is almost four months ago and there's a lot of fluctuation in prices, protocol treasury has not decreased that much. It stay around the 10 billion mark. And here's a list about all the different protocol tokens that Uniswap have. And you can see right here, uniswap is 99% of its own native token and they don't really have much ethereum or even USD which is sort of less volatile than Unisoft's native token. So when I first saw this I thought, oh my God, these projects have so much money and then they should be doing great.
01:36:07.762 - 01:37:11.346, Speaker G: And then I realized most of these protocols are native token and maybe native tokens are not the best thing because it's not liquid, it's hard to sell and you introduce a lot of different weird incentives on managing your treasury. So I was thinking is it only Uniswap or is there a lot of different Dows facing the same problem? As it turns out, it's definitely the same problem across many Dows. So Uni has a larger Treasury UXD, which is a stable coin protocol on Salana also has this problem. They have $600 million of treasury and 99.4% of them are in their native tokens. And even one of the most established dows maker is also having the same problem where most of their treasuries make up native tokens. And lido on the other hand is probably the one that has the most ethereum or even just stable assets in treasury.
01:37:11.346 - 01:38:09.340, Speaker G: And we can see 10% of it is in ethereum and another 1.6% is in stake ETH. I think that the message here is quite clear where we have a big market in the protocol treasury space but we have a big problem at the same time where most of them are in native tokens. And this is another graph from Mango talking about how much they have, which is very interesting because not a lot of people know about Mango but they actually have 50 million of USDS in their treasury. So I talked about why native token is not the greatest thing. I want to dive a little bit deeper into it and talk about why high concentration of native token in protocol treasury has big problems and there are two main big problems. And the first one is crypto is a volatile market so there can be sharp decreases in crypto treasury value.
01:38:09.340 - 01:39:03.738, Speaker G: For example, these treasury values can decrease 50% or even 95% over three month period. Very fast. This is a graph of Uniswap and we can see decrease around 60% in the last six months. And second is why high concentration of native token is not great is because for any protocol to achieve its vision, it needs to continue to grow. And this growth mostly comes from cash but not native token. In a simplified example below, let's say we can see protocol treasury rewards people who drive the growth of the protocol. So treasury rewards people and people drives growth because they build on top of it where they do different outreach but the people in the end have to pay for their utilities, pay for their rents, pay for their food.
01:39:03.738 - 01:39:52.934, Speaker G: So they have to trade with the market to get USDC or ETH which is more liquid assets for them to offboard. And a caveat on top of it, which you can think of as this third small point, which is okay. Yeah. This is an example where if you want to sell 1% of uniswap's treasury, it would cost the uniswap price to decrease 40% just to tell you how illiquid the market is for these native assets. And it's very hard to convert them into cash and pay contributors. Lastly, it's probably a small caveat building on top of the second point, which is the huddle versus sustainability dilemma. Because imagine you're a protocol.
01:39:52.934 - 01:41:10.190, Speaker G: You're telling your friends and your family to join the community, to become a part of the Dao, and at the same time, let's huddle to the moon, a moonshot opportunity. But at the same time you're like, oh, but we have to sell our treasury tokens for USDC, otherwise we can't function. So essentially you're using your token holders as sort of a semi form of exit liquidity which has by design very hard marketing and community management aspect to it. So one question naturally arise. We have this huge amount of money inside different protocol treasury. Is there any way we can generate cash from it, whether it can be selling tokens very directly or is there any other way we can generate cash? So I would love to first give the current potential solutions for protocol treasury and the way I put potential because some projects may not be live or even they have not gained significant traction. And I divided these solutions into three categories based on its sort of difficulty of understanding this categorization is not meant to be which layer is better than the others because many times a simpler solution just wins.
01:41:10.190 - 01:42:00.494, Speaker G: However, I do believe that we're still in the searching phase in which we're trying to find more optimized solutions to handle protocol treasuries. And on the bottom are the low hanging fruits. You can see that these solutions are already established and have been utilized by protocols quite extensively. In the middle are traditional finance solutions. These solutions borrow existing ideas from corporate finance, implement them into different ideas on chain. And lastly on top of it are some sort of like crypto native solutions or innovative solutions where these solutions are less utilized in the traditional world but will bring promising ideas to the crypto world. And there's a lot of different names here, there's a lot of different projects.
01:42:00.494 - 01:42:37.514, Speaker G: I can see some projects have been blurred out in black and white. The only black and white logo I found for Xerox Protocol they're still live, they're still doing well. But for Porter Finance and Faye Protocol unfortunately since the last time I made this slide they have seized their operation. They have not moved forward as a Dow decided to stop working on their respective products. However, I think there's a lot of interesting ideas in this slide. So I'm going to do a quick rapid fire of different ideas. People have been thinking about how do we diversify.
01:42:37.514 - 01:43:50.500, Speaker G: Our treasury. The way I want to describe different designs is through how people are doing this problem in the past. What is the problem here and how is this specific project going to help or trying to change on top of it? So uma's, success token is a way to deal with the OTC deals that are buying at cheaper prices. So normally when protocols sell its treasury one way they do it is through accredited investor or a fund sometimes where people does a fund where the person buy treasury token at a lower valuation but at a higher lockup. The problem with this design is that it's really hard to generate community buy in because people always feel like quote unquote, they're gonna be dumped on. So uma is a way to align those incentives where instead of buying at a lower price you get more upside. So as the price increases you get sort of this linear bonus of more tokens where you can claim after a specific stripe price.
01:43:50.500 - 01:45:10.730, Speaker G: And I think this is a very interesting idea and we might require some data oracles but normally it's not going to be a huge problem for the Dows to handle. I think it's going to be a very interesting way to see their design to get more implemented in the dao space for a protocol treasury diversification second is a lock streaming auction. So in the past token sales are always with a fixed price. So for example the lido dow treasury diversification is a great example where they sold a lump sum of lido for a fixed amount of cash. The problem is it's generally very hard to agree on a token sale price for a community and we can see it from the second proposal from Dragonfly where there's a lot of discussions about what is the correct terms and how should we think about different things. So lock is a way to essentially do continuous streaming auction where people can commit capital and withdrew unlock capital at any time. The way is to find market clearing price for a set of tokens during each epoch and to sort of achieve it in a way where people where this mechanism can absorb different price volatility and form a long term price stability for treasury diversification.
01:45:10.730 - 01:46:11.146, Speaker G: Next one is Faye's Turbo. Unfortunately Faye has decided to stop building on top of the products but the code base is still there. I think people can definitely still innovate on top of it and find different ways to work on this problem. So in the past protocols you can't really collateralize your native token. So what I mean by collateralizing it is deposit your token into Aave or any of other money markets and borrow USD or USDC on top of it. And the reason why you can't do that is that most protocols do not meet the risk parameters because for any assets to be considered a collateral it has to be vetted extensively by the Aave community to make sure you don't introduce debt into the system. And what Faye achieves to do is to collateral against your own token and you can earn interest on top of it through Turbo.
01:46:11.146 - 01:47:11.714, Speaker G: So instead of borrowing USDC and use USDC whatever way you can, you can only use USDC in different EO bearing asset standards. So for example, if your token value decrease too fast and you need to be liquidated, you can do it in a much more efficient way where quote unquote, you don't really get liquidated because the protocol controls your collateralized assets at the same time. Next is ribbons. Treasury. So in the past, most protocols just do not have a diversification plan, right? What time shall we sell our tokens? How much we sell? That's going to be a very difficult discussion to have once you're in the bull market. But right now we're in a bear market so it's much easier for us to agree on how should we diversify. And Ribbons asset is just a cover call vault which essentially in plain man's term is that we decide on when we're going to sell stuff.
01:47:11.714 - 01:48:14.178, Speaker G: Let's say right now, let's say we're in the uniswap Dow and we think okay, we should sell uniswap when uniswap two X and let's sell 1 million of uniswap. Then that's essentially you can code that up in a ribbon vault and then sell this option to different people and people can buy it as an option to get exposure to the upside other than the two X. Now this is a very fast rapid fire. I hope you guys are still with me. The whole point of the rapid fire is to give you some ideas people are building and also show you how innovative people are thinking about how can we build different structures for financial aspect of things. On the Dow Treasury, although some projects are not specifically Dow focused but a lot of it going to be used by, has been used very extensively for DAOs. For example, Ribbon, where I mentioned at the last, a lot of their customers actually are DAOs who are trying to generate yield on a passive manner.
01:48:14.178 - 01:49:05.942, Speaker G: So now comes to a question what can you build? Right? There's a lot of ideas floating around. I talked about a lot of ideas. What can you build? So this is a graph I showed before when I was mentioning these solutions I mentioned they're only potential. A lot of these tools are extremely, extremely hard for developers to understand, especially the artworkers who does not have a strong finance background. And guess what? Most Dow developers are like that because not everyone comes from a finance background. So the trade off between there's a lot of protocols have a lot of parameters you can tune but it's very hard to visualize how those parameters can have impact on different things. And the second is the adoption of these system.
01:49:05.942 - 01:50:02.438, Speaker G: Your protocol treasury is still very low. I think that could be a very key point where it's just very hard to talk to developers or even general community members on what does these things do and then how can we visualize the effects of different parameters on the end result. So what can you build? I think the first thing is that it's important to decrease the trust assumptions for different interactions we have when thinking about treasury diversification. And what I mean by this is you can codify different agreements on chain. Sorry. So there are two very straightforward ideas that I have not seen a great implementation that has a lot of traction. So there are two kinds of contract I think would be very suitable for this kind of idea to decrease trust assumption.
01:50:02.438 - 01:50:40.160, Speaker G: So number one is token swap contract. So token swap essentially is a way for protocol to exchange their token treasuries with different protocols to build partnership. For example, Uniswap can exchange with Aave so they have sort of an alliance because they hold each other's token. The second one is pipe. That's a fancy way of saying private entity wants to invest in a public entity, sort of like a lido situation where a lot of different funds wants to buy a large chunk of lido tokens through the open market. And you can do it in a one time thing or you can do it in a streaming kind of.
