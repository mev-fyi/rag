00:00:07.210 - 00:00:08.494, Speaker A: Hey, Dennis. How are you?
00:00:08.532 - 00:00:09.518, Speaker B: I'm good, how are you?
00:00:09.604 - 00:00:17.342, Speaker A: I'm doing great. We've known each other for something like five years. Yeah, but I've only seen you since.
00:00:17.396 - 00:00:23.342, Speaker B: Before COVID That's right. Yeah, we hugged out outside. Great venue, great opening. Thanks for having me.
00:00:23.476 - 00:00:32.310, Speaker A: We're going to catch up on stage, basically live. So let's start off with something that's been on my mind. Are NFTs dead.
00:00:34.090 - 00:00:35.800, Speaker B: I'm going to need a sip of water.
00:00:37.690 - 00:00:55.242, Speaker A: There seems to be a belief that sort of NFTs are sort of fizzling out. We kind of don't think anybody cares about 10,000 kind of mints of a profile or looking cool or flipping JPEGs. What do you think kind of NFTs look like now? And kind of where role do they play in our ecosystem?
00:00:55.306 - 00:01:32.618, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe to start to place it a bit in the broader context, just like what this conference is all about. I think there's this typical kind of media narrative of all technology. Waves kind of come in cycles and there's kind of hype and you have booms and busts. And I think the kind of economic, financial nature of crypto because program money, scarcity ownership underpins everything, I think it really magnifies those booms and busts. But we all know the meme that kind of starting with Bitcoin. There's been over 100 proclamations. Bitcoin is dead yet again.
00:01:32.618 - 00:02:17.346, Speaker B: Then we have smart contracts are dead, DFI is dead, and of course, NFTs are dead in the same narrative. The cycle repeats itself. I think, again, all the headlines, all the stories throughout the years, unfortunately focus on the price action, primarily. And I think a lot of the nuance of the most interesting things happening is not captured there. But I do think obviously the markets are down, the prices are down, and a lot of the early use case and again, for better or for worse, I think the early use cases of crypto that kind of blow up very quickly tend to be more speculative. And NFTs are no different. So kind of the framework I have is that we've kind of only been through the first chapter of NFTs and it's been very kind of commerce trading driven.
00:02:17.346 - 00:02:54.146, Speaker B: I think the canonical platform representing this chapter is OpenSea, right? It's a marketplace. It's kind of this ebay beanie baby trading paradigm. And these cases we've seen is obviously the PFPs, the crypto punks, the board apes, all about high prices. And the framework I have for this is that the first chapter was commerce driven. But there's another analogy I really like. There's a turn of the century, 19th century economist, close Thurstein Veblen. Does anybody know Veblen? And he wrote this treatise called The Theory of the Leisure Class.
00:02:54.146 - 00:03:26.250, Speaker B: Has anyone read that? He talks about this idea of conspicuous consumption. So in that world, kind of coming out of the industrial revolution, another technology wave that people demonstrated their status in society by what they consumed. So you purchased expensive things, luxury goods. You owned an expensive house, expensive car. You demonstrated your role in society through buying expensive things and kind of showing off to other people. And I think crypto starts and it kind of mirrors that in very primitive ways. We had the PFPs that were very expensive.
00:03:26.250 - 00:04:11.094, Speaker B: You bought them, you traded them, you tried to profit off of the commerce around them. And again, if you changed your PFP, people knew you had a lot of money. It was about this status through the price around it. And I think there's an economists since have actually identified different forms of capital that was financial capital, but we also have social capital and cultural capital. And I think NFTs are actually amazing technology for the latter two, and we're seeing a lot of interesting use cases there. So just to continue that kind of economic arc, as the 20th century has commoditized wealth, we have way more equality, just access to goods in society. Today, if you want to have a nice house, you can get a mortgage.
00:04:11.094 - 00:04:48.918, Speaker B: If you want to drive a fancy car, you can probably lease it. Today there's like, services. If you want to take out a $20,000 handbag to a party, you can rent it overnight. So to show your status in society, it is no longer actually it becomes kind of ostentatious to have very expensive things. It's no longer high status. And the way you show off your values, your knowledge today, is it's through investments in culture, information. What things do you value? Do you value organic food? Do you work out? We're in New York City, kind of a fashion capital of the world.
00:04:48.918 - 00:05:18.074, Speaker B: Maybe 20 years ago, if you were in Soho, people were wearing very expensive clothes. Today you're seeing a lot of workout clothes. And what does that say about people? It's that health is important. I exercise, I work out. I value these things with the objects we use to express. Those things are cultural know. So it's what brands do we align ourselves with? What music do we listen to? What do we read? I think another New York example is the New Yorker magazine.
00:05:18.074 - 00:05:56.362, Speaker B: Right? This kind of cultural institution doing great cultural analysis. If you subscribe to The Yorker, they actually sent you a free tote bag. And if you kind of walk around the city, if you keep an eye out for it, you see people wearing The New Yorker tote bag. And what does it represent about you? Probably you have a certain level of education, you have a certain kind of political views. You find certain topics interesting. So to tie it back to NFTs, I think a lot of our cultural identity is built around the objects that we own. So I think in tech, for example, if you work at a company, you work at Coinbase, for example, you're very proud of being part of the Coinbase mission.
00:05:56.362 - 00:06:25.430, Speaker B: You wear that object proudly at conferences. We have laptop stickers representing the technologies we believe in, things like that. You guys probably know very well. The culture of the Ethereum community versus the Salana community is very specific. So our thesis for chapter two of the NFT ecosystem is that it's going to be a lot more of a these are going to be social artifacts, community artifacts, and through collecting things. It's not about price. It's not about scarce supply.
00:06:25.430 - 00:07:01.566, Speaker B: It's about participating with brands. You believe in communities whose values mirror yours to show to other people that you are participating in the same things. Our belief is that NFTs are a new technology to basically give us native digital objects to connect people much more closely. And I think this builds up a lot. On top of so many subcultures exist on social media platforms, Instagram, TikTok. And our bet is that if NFTs truly work, like, actually being online will be more meaningful, more exciting. You will make closer connections with creators, with the communities we want to be a part of, if you can actually own these community artifacts.
00:07:01.758 - 00:07:36.320, Speaker A: So that was a lot, that was great setting because I have like 40 questions from all that. So we'll dive all deep into all of these. It's a very interesting context, and I think that economical analogy works really well. So kind of my most obvious question here is, is there like a single test that kind of works for all of these cases where you know that you're now in the second era of something? Or did you mean to kind of only imply that where we are now is simply that the speculation piece is over? Because now it's not about how much money you're spending to get some status. And that's always the first step into that second transition. Where does that switch happen?
00:07:38.130 - 00:08:15.686, Speaker B: Basically, these big multi million dollar NFT drops. We're no longer seeing them anymore. If you look at OpenSea trading activity, kind of volume wise, it's down a actually, over the past year, there's this new technology has emerged, which is the Open Edition NFT, and also over the past few months, kind of the rise of free NFTs. And I think that's a great parallel where it's not about price, this is not an investment. This is more of like a community artifact. So I think just all the interesting things that we're seeing happening today is much more social use cases around free and abundant NFTs that serve as more of a community artifacts.
00:08:15.878 - 00:08:40.500, Speaker A: Got it. So obviously, it's no longer about collecting the most expensive image, especially with kind of Freeman's and Open Editions. You kind of get to effectively commoditize the price being like the key factor. What changes in this definition on how do people then kind of converge? We're effectively coming up with new different subcultures now because you're signaling what you care about.
00:08:40.950 - 00:08:41.890, Speaker B: Totally.
00:08:42.390 - 00:08:46.566, Speaker A: We just now map what we do in person to online or is there something different about Web Three?
00:08:46.668 - 00:09:48.214, Speaker B: Yeah, in 2021, 2022, I think we've seen some of the early use cases, and a big kind of application has been when you mint NFT, what do you do with it? There was discord bots tools like Collab Land, for example, that you were able to create a space for the community, for the members in there to enter to meet each other. And the object was really kind of this unifying thing. Analogy I use is, if you're like a teenager into skateboarding, you probably wear there's a magazine called Thrasher. You probably wear some merchandise from some skate brands. You have baggy jeans, you have skate shoes on. If your parents are dragging you to Thanksgiving or whatever to visit Grandma and you see another skater kid cross the room, you know your people through these physical artifacts that they're bringing onto this. I think NFTs give us a similar thing that if there's some kind of movement event happening.
00:09:48.214 - 00:10:21.154, Speaker B: I think a lot of the L two S have been leveraging NFTs in really interesting ways. If you believe the values of optimism, if you believe in retroactive funding to the open source ecosystem, optimism has a really cool brand. And you can collect this object. You can show it off in your wallet. And I think what's also interesting is because everything is on chain, everything is public. The way kind of brands and movements propagate through these objects showing up in your on chain activity, there's interesting blockchain activity, NFT activity aggregators emerging like interface tools like fund.
00:10:21.192 - 00:10:24.354, Speaker A: So all these people don't know what's interface just so we can give it.
00:10:24.392 - 00:10:52.254, Speaker B: Interface is an application that you connect your wallet and you can see basically the actions you take on chain kind of visualized and focused on NFTs. So if I follow Kardik and he's collecting NFTs, I can see what he's collecting. I think what's really interesting is that your mint action becomes it's kind of an act of curation. So I'm like, oh, kartik is cool. What is this weird thing he collected today? I better check it out. Maybe I'm into the things he's into.
00:10:52.292 - 00:10:54.640, Speaker A: Maybe I want to Raya Pepe's as well.
00:10:56.050 - 00:10:57.200, Speaker B: Something for everyone.
00:11:00.130 - 00:11:36.182, Speaker A: To me, the most interesting thing about what you were just saying is that from your perspective, you're analyzing what's happening. And I'm curious about whether you believe that everybody else knows this already and we just haven't verbalized it, or is also that we got to point that out. The kind of question I have is how much of do you think this is like conscious decision making from people who are collecting this thing because they really care about others, knowing what they're known for and being able to kind of publicly look at the cultures they're part of or the values that they represent? Or do you think this is kind of just we have to actively point out this is why it's going on. And how much of that is like synthesis versus kind of prediction?
00:11:36.326 - 00:12:18.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a lot of is observation of emerging behavior. I think a common pattern we keep seeing is if you collect an NFT and you tweet about it. So again, it's like, what is Twitter about? We say things, we share things, and we kind of try to get engagement from people interested in the same ideas as us. We try to be influential. We try to build a following. And I think NFT science is a really, really interesting phenomenon where you kind of combine the web two social distribution of Twitter with this ownership, community participation, commerce aspect of NFTs. And this one specific case keeps emerging where you mint something and you share that, you minted it, and you mentioned the creator.
00:12:18.370 - 00:12:49.650, Speaker B: And this kind of really interesting flywheel opens up where, oh, the creator gets a notification, they respond, maybe they follow you back. So it feels like this kind of patronage relationship where you're connecting with the creator. Maybe the creator retweets it, and you become one of many retweets by the creator of the collector sharing it. And then the collector, because they follow the creator, they see the other collectors, and they're like, oh, you also meant to this. You're one of my people. So, again, it's like social connections, but not through social graphs, not through interest groups, but it's through this ownership commerce artifact. And we think that's the innovation.
00:12:50.070 - 00:13:08.190, Speaker A: That's a really interesting point. So does in this case, this change or going to adjust what the definition of storytelling is? Because this is still now a more direct way of following somebody or something you care about. But how do you kind of overlap this with how do you tell stories now that you have access to this wider audience that cares about these subcultures?
00:13:08.290 - 00:13:53.590, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. I think it's obviously brands and businesses in order to differentiate from all the competition, how do you become seen as different in the marketplace? And I think the history, the backstory is really important. When we were preparing for this, we were talking about white papers, right? Like Bitcoin White paper, the ethereum white paper, these kind of founding documents of these technology movements written before the technology was even built, but painted a future of things are going to be different. We want things to change. And it was kind of a document that rallied the community together. So I think kind of where Mirror fits into that is we're a publishing tool where I think inspired a lot by this is you can share your story with the world.
00:13:53.590 - 00:14:16.906, Speaker B: A lot of builders in the space use it, developers, companies, also creators. But that story can also be collectible. So imagine imagine if the bitcoin white paper was an NFT. Imagine what that would mean to the people there. They could connect with each other by being early adopters. But then 15 years later, ten years later, it kind of becomes Declaration of Independence, some kind of like founding document.
00:14:16.938 - 00:14:46.214, Speaker A: The manifesto kind of coming. Yeah, I do want to talk about mirror a lot, but I want to just kind of check one more thing. So you made a really interesting kind of observation around the optimism ecosystem, around the retro PGF and people caring about a specific cause. We kind of saw this whole on chain summer campaign by Base and a lot of that was also driven by kind of different launches of various NFTs or just signaling and sort of overall just Freeman's kind of becoming more and more accessible. Does that kind of fit the same narrative that you're kind of talking about? How would you kind of analyze what happened with Base and last month?
00:14:46.252 - 00:15:08.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Base has been really awesome. We've had the privilege of them being kind of a mirror power user. Their whole philosophy is they want everything they do in the world. They want to be on chain. And obviously they're trying to bring an L2 in the world from scratch and kind of build a brand identity on it, et cetera. And their kind of Genesis announcement started with the Base logo. And this is kind of like a playbook we're seeing.
00:15:08.574 - 00:15:20.046, Speaker B: If you're putting yourself into the world, you can make your brand collectible. And the first touch point with your audience isn't just in web two. It's not just getting likes or followers on Twitter.
00:15:20.158 - 00:15:22.626, Speaker A: You can actually ownership on day one.
00:15:22.648 - 00:15:40.598, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Give something and place it in your wallet. I think it's very interesting. It's this active ownership. But then Base is building a connection with their audience on chain. They see their users as ENS names, as wallets. Everyone who owns that NFT is kind of connected to each other through being one of the collectors there.
00:15:40.598 - 00:15:58.400, Speaker B: And I think the meme kind of propagates because again, if I follow cardik on one of these NFT social platforms, I can see oh wait, what Base? What is know? Let me check that out. Let me dig in. Think it's again. I think it's like putting on your favorite band t shirt and signaling what you believe. I think there's kind of in group, out group.
00:15:58.770 - 00:16:39.994, Speaker A: We see that in tech altogether. If you are in the Bay Area, you'll see people wearing t shirts of what their companies are and that's a point for them to, hey, what does this company do? Or why are you kind of there? Why are you so proud of? So it's the same behaviors now kind of minted on chain and trackable too, in a good way, obviously. I'm sure a lot of people here know what Mirror is. If you've used any depth and heard about any of the updates that they've done on their protocol or company or products, you've got to see the blog post that's published on Mirror. So my kind of first question here is, is Mirror a blog publishing platform? And if not, what's kind of the new best definition that people should know?
00:16:40.112 - 00:17:11.826, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think Mirror started off as kind of an experiment can we build? We always believe that the next Big Thing will begin as a story. And I think it's tons of crypto examples. I think Tesla as an example. Tesla has like there was the Secret Master plan, I think from 2007 or something that's kind of like canonical tenure tenure plan. Again, kind of like a white paper for the future. And all the fanboys really rallied around that document.
00:17:11.826 - 00:17:39.662, Speaker B: And we think that the next Big Thing. Again, the storytelling is so important to it. So the initial goal of Mirror was to build a tool for that that was completely on chain. So you log in with an Ethereum wallet, uses ENS names, all the data stored on chain on Rweave. But then this was end of 2020 kind of before NFT took off. And then as NFT took off we were like wow, stories really catalyze people. They get them really excited, they bring people together and to share an idea.
00:17:39.662 - 00:18:12.026, Speaker B: But then, now that we have NFTs, there's a way to make that idea ownable, give ownership a way to interact with it and kind of plan to stake that. I believe in this, I follow this. So basically from the beginning we've made all content on Mirror collectible and Mirror has evolved into deeper NFT integration. So today you can embed any NFT across the space on Ethereum. So what's cool is that while Base use Mirror for publishing, they also experiment with a lot of other NFT tools. Mirror allows them to aggregate all of their NFT creation. It's all mintable in line.
00:18:12.026 - 00:18:14.214, Speaker B: I think that's another beauty of openness.
00:18:14.262 - 00:18:18.234, Speaker A: Is can we talk about certain examples of which tools and how does that flow work?
00:18:18.272 - 00:18:53.826, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Again, they have this on chain first strategy. So they are trying to spread the love, use all the tools. So they use, you know, they collaborate with and you know, because everything what is an NFT? It's a smart contract on the blockchain with publicly accessible interfaces. We make those interactive in the Mirror tool. So just like you can embed a YouTube video in any website, you can embed any NFT into Mirror and use Mirror storytelling tools to give the context to explain what's happening here, but then embed this collectible object that anyone can mint in line. We also provide subscription tools.
00:18:53.826 - 00:19:46.760, Speaker B: So I think we've also noticed that I think Web Three builders build in a you know, they try to build everything on chain and I think miss some of the kind of classic reengagement mechanisms that Web Two is really good at. It's a no mailing list or no brainer for publishing. I think it's like you have newsletter functionality. So Mirror lets you subscribe with your wallet but also with your email. So if you want to get that next update, next announcement, if there's a new drop coming from a project you love, mirror integrates with email functionality. And it's been very successful to give our users more distributions ways to reengage. So if an NFT drop is kind of like a point in time, we want Mirror to be more of like a line that your journey as a project can be all chronicled down Mirror, all your collectibles can live here and just again, a much better way to retain your audience and continue engaging them.
00:19:48.090 - 00:19:59.750, Speaker A: But this is still touching, largely kind of storytelling through text and kind of NFTs or collecting those stories is sort of different than Minting. An NFT that's specific to what an embed is. Is that a fair assessment?
00:19:59.830 - 00:21:07.858, Speaker B: Yeah. So what we're working on now and over the past few months is leaning into more making NFTs kind of first class objects. So stories give the important context, but we think that NFTs are the kind of community artifacts that glue things together. And basically if you have multiple NFTs, how can you get a sense of who's the biggest fan in your community? Who are the top collectors that keep coming back? I think there's very kind of gamified element to everything. In crypto we're exploring leaderboards. What would it look like to highlight your top collectors? Who collects everything? Who collects everything first? Who's been the earliest community participant? So we think that this is a great way for the community to not just feel like they're collecting kind of in private, but that they have a presence in the community that everyone can see their standing and also adding ways to engage more deeply. Comments discussion again, I think we see that Minting should feel like it's the beginning of a journey, it's the beginning of participating in interactions, being part of.
00:21:07.864 - 00:21:12.014, Speaker A: A community by definition the starting point for them to kind of now get into a subculture.
00:21:12.062 - 00:21:40.022, Speaker B: I think today Minting has felt like you Mint a JPEG and it's kind of the end. What do you do now? You can't really connect with the other collectors. The experience still feels like it's like ether scan. We're kind of seeing a list of transactions, list of wallets. You can't engage with people, you can't communicate. I think that's going to really open up this social use case for all of these cultural effects to emerge. I think you need ways to connect socially.
00:21:40.022 - 00:22:12.406, Speaker B: I think a lot of the stuff that I've talked about, the beauty of New York as kind of a subculture capital, it's the density of people. Everyone is seeing conferences like this. You guys are within proximity to each other. It's about the conversations we have here, connecting with other people. And I think on chain transactions, an analogy, I use it's as if everyone got a phone number, but there's no phones. We can't communicate. We all have IDs, we all have wallets, and people talk about wallets as these social Identifiers, but we can't really communicate with each other yet.
00:22:12.406 - 00:22:17.270, Speaker B: And I think once that opens up, NFTs will be much more of these social community assets.
00:22:19.450 - 00:22:32.858, Speaker A: Is kind of your belief that with those lines being installed to communicate between those two addresses, something that mirrors should be taking on? Or is that just the hope that this kind of helps accelerate that? Or where does that mirror come in?
00:22:32.944 - 00:23:23.820, Speaker B: We're excited to play a big role there because we think actually a big question we've been asking, why would you collect something, especially if it's not like a financial use case? And I think it's exactly my next question. It's to have social interactions, and I think you need to kind of build them into the minting action that can you mint with a comment to give your take on? Can it be kind of I think a long form is a great conversation starter. Can people that are minting the thing be also engaging through conversation? Like, what do they think about this? If they mint an artwork, can they say what they felt about it and give the collector more of a presence? That it's not just a list of buyers, but it's actually people with reactions they care about. The work moves them, it makes them feel a certain way, and again, creating a space for people to connect.
00:23:25.630 - 00:23:38.210, Speaker A: Does this change the definition of mirror from a kind of publishing platform to more of a social network or kind of do you not want to kind of cross that line? How do you see the social aspects of here kind of becoming more prominent in the future?
00:23:38.360 - 00:23:58.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I think our goal is to expand, to be more of an NFT community tool where stories are at the core of it. And I think that there's so many ways to make NFTs. There's tons of addition tools. And I think what makes Mary different is there's a much richer context. So I think it's NFTs with context, with community presence.
00:24:00.650 - 00:24:25.854, Speaker A: So a couple more questions on just as that piece unlocks. How do you kind of take best advantage of all these things and sort of use that to anyone from do better storytelling to come up with a better kind of culture for what you care about? How in your kind of mind does that enhance storytelling for kind of collectors or community builders and sort of what do you think some unique things kind of end up now becoming possible?
00:24:26.052 - 00:25:13.726, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we have this framing of I think an earlier title for the stock was kind of what does an on chain brand look like? And I think the beauty of it, I think this strategy works for big creators. Public companies like Coinbase can leverage on chain brand strategy by introducing brand assets that are digital collectibles, but also a small creator, a small artist, whether it's a musician, playing with music, NFTs playing with artworks that can be collected. I think we'll see more and more creators take on this playbook. And I think it's both a new business model, but again, it's a way to create deeper engagements with community. And if it wins and if it's successful, I think people will find that this way of engaging, participating, basically spending time online, is becoming more interesting, more.
00:25:13.748 - 00:25:17.690, Speaker A: Exciting, and kind of helps you earn.
00:25:17.850 - 00:25:18.670, Speaker B: Totally.
00:25:19.810 - 00:25:24.290, Speaker A: I don't fully understand how that's a new business model. I'd love to kind of dive deeper into this.
00:25:24.360 - 00:26:18.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a big bet of ours is actually what I mentioned before is what is an NFT? It's a program on the blockchain with public interfaces that anyone can interact with. I actually think the thing that disrupts a marketplace like OpenSea won't be another marketplace. I think Blair has done a lot of cool things, but I think actually a social experience where you connect through communities, you follow collectors you're interested in, you discover projects through kind of the social graphs around NFTs. That platform will have very strong network effects, just like instagram has strong networks. But because it's NFTs, commerce will be native to those experiences. So every time you see a pretty JPEG, there will be a mint button in the corner. I think the platform that's able to build the social graph around NFTs will dominate commerce because commerce will just be built in.
00:26:18.434 - 00:26:18.926, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:19.048 - 00:26:47.920, Speaker A: And effectively kind of going back to the very first thing you said on how kind of cultures and economic sort of progression sort of follows, you're effectively saying that at the end of the day, curation is kind of key. And as people get better at that by either following somebody who they respect or just kind of having somebody come up who is better than whatever professional curator is or a critic is, you get to sort of unlock a whole new sort of era. Was that kind of good?
00:26:48.370 - 00:27:36.106, Speaker B: I think a way of putting it is we think that collection is a form of creation if you make it public. So if kardik is really interested in interesting subcultures, he has great taste. Every time he collects, he's sharing what he's interested with the world. And if you're an early adopter of some weird niche, weird subculture, you're worth following and you influence because you connect all of these different projects, and now you become a tastemaker and you become worth following. I think what's also interesting with all the value flows being programmable, you can be in the value flow. So I think there's potential for revenue sharing and rewards to flow to the creator. But I think in the eyes of the creator that you're collecting from, you become a valuable kind of distributor.
00:27:36.106 - 00:27:36.702, Speaker B: You know what I mean?
00:27:36.756 - 00:27:38.240, Speaker A: I know it's just to kind of.
00:27:38.690 - 00:28:36.878, Speaker B: Access an observation we had was there's just way more collectors than creators and who can help. The creator, spread the word and get distribution. I think it's the collectors. I think if you can create networks of collectors following each other, again, these kind of TASE groups, interest networks based on collection activity, it increases the reason to collect because collecting kind of gives you back to the point, all the analogies around social capital, cultural capital, what you collect gives you status. And I think it's just building on top of 20th century behavior. What are you reading? What clothes are you wearing? Is it allbirds or is it Nikes? All of these things through the physical object wear. What does driving a Prius say about your values? Are you putting solar panels on your house to save money on energy? Or are you trying to make a statement about your values, your politics, et cetera? Again, digital objects.
00:28:36.878 - 00:28:40.690, Speaker B: Let us do this in a much deeper way at the scale of the internet.
00:28:41.990 - 00:29:00.182, Speaker A: This is excellent framing. My kind of last question would be to sort of dig a little bit deeper into this comment again, which is kind of turning that back onto you. What is some practical advice you can kind of give, whether it's a collector or a creator here to kind of best take advantage of this new model and get better at building their on chain brand.
00:29:00.326 - 00:29:36.734, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think what's exciting about this era in the market is the price point is a lot more accessible. So the Freeman, there's a dollar fee usually across this platform. So just trying it out and participating is a lot more accessible and I think explore some of the cool platforms. We just launched a new explore and discovery experience on Mirror. If you go on to our homepage so you can discover interesting projects there's, cool projects like Zora Manifold MindApp Fund where you can discover a lot of cool NFTs to Mint. But I think I would say as a collector, try Minting, try joining some of these communities.
00:29:36.734 - 00:30:25.230, Speaker B: And I think as a creator, as a brand, as a company, think about how can your brand, your project live in your community's wallet. Right? We're all trying to get users of our protocols, platforms on chain. I think what better way to raise awareness is you're probably going to get a lot of laptop stickers today at this conference. What is like a digitally native laptop sticker? How do you get your brand in your potential users wallet? And I think free NFT is a really good way to activate your audience, increase your brand awareness, spread the word. And I think Mirror is a great way to do that. You can publish your Hello World post, but also mint your first NFT, build your subscriber base. And we've seen tremendous success with just way more engagement when there's something to collect from the audience.
00:30:25.850 - 00:30:32.226, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for kind of being here and that was an excellent discussion. Hopefully we get to think about building our own on chain brand.
00:30:32.258 - 00:30:33.366, Speaker B: Thank you for having me. Thanks, everyone.
00:30:33.468 - 00:30:34.360, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody.
