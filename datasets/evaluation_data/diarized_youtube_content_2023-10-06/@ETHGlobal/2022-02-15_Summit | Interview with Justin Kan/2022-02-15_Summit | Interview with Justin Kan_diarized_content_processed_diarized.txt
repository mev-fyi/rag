00:00:06.490 - 00:00:36.680, Speaker A: Next up, we are ready for our next talk and want to invite Justin Khan for an interview. I want to take this opportunity to kind of welcome him and introduce him. Most of you know Justin as the co founder of Twitch, but as of recently, Justin is CEO and founder of Fractal. So we're going to cover a handful of things around how this event is going and a few things that I think you are uniquely suitable to kind of give your insights on and we'll kind of jump right in. Welcome.
00:00:37.370 - 00:00:39.798, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. How are you?
00:00:39.884 - 00:00:53.920, Speaker A: I am doing great. I kind of did a poor job at describing your background. So what I'll do is I'll let you kind of give us a quick overview of sort of what Fractal is and sort of how you got to it and your journey from kind of Twitch to where you are now.
00:00:54.450 - 00:01:25.306, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So I've been an Internet entrepreneur and investor for the last 18 years now. Kind of started my career right as Web Two was kicking off and built a lot of different companies. The one that people know about is Twitch, which started off as us building our own streaming platform, actually us trying to build our own streaming show first and then turning it into a platform and then eventually really focusing that platform on gaming. And it turned out to be much bigger than we ever thought. And we sold Twitch to Amazon in 2014.
00:01:25.306 - 00:02:12.840, Speaker B: And after that, I've been investing in companies, incubating companies, and most recently been really interested in crypto and Web Three. And a couple of months ago, I started working on a new project called Fractal. And the high level of Fractal is fractal is a marketplace for digital in game assets. So gaming NFTs I think there's this huge wave coming of blockchain games that are all reaching a new capital market, new player base through selling the assets digitally. And we want to power that revolution, so that's what we're doing. You introduced me as the CEO, but my co founder Dave is actually the CEO, and I founded it with him and an amazing team.
00:02:13.450 - 00:02:37.120, Speaker A: Well, apologies for that. This is great. I do want to dig into factual sort of how you sort of landed on this idea, but maybe I'd love to kind of learn more about just sort of why or how did you decide to sort of jump in now into crypto? Obviously, I think you've been exposed to this space for a handful of years. So curious to kind of get your background. When did you kind of hear about crypto? When did it become interesting from a hobby to Sirius and what that experience was like?
00:02:37.650 - 00:03:12.378, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think I first heard about bitcoin pretty. It was like 2011, something like that. But I was kind of like, oh, this is an experiment. I think it's probably illegal. I don't know if it's going to work. So I didn't pursue it at all. And then in 2013 was when I first started buying Bitcoin because I think that was one of the first price run ups and I was trying to invest in Coinbase and my friend Brian's company and kind of missed seed round buy some coin goes just going to kill me.
00:03:12.378 - 00:03:51.426, Speaker B: So I bought some at like 800, which is and it immediately crashed like 200 and I was like, I'm like literally the bag holder, I'm such a sucker. And then I just forgot about it. And so then obviously like years later the price was accelerating again and I was like, okay, something's here. This thing has existed for years now. And I saw Ethereum come and start to get some traction and I was like, I don't know what's going to work here. So I just invested in some crypto funds, like I LP a few crypto funds, that turned out to be a pretty good idea. But as a programmer I was like, I don't know if any of this stuff is going to work for the type of thing that I like to do, which is consumer based applications.
00:03:51.426 - 00:04:31.874, Speaker B: I didn't really see kind of like a high transaction throughput application being able to work. And so I actually at the time became an advisor. A few people building projects that were applications. One was called Audius, which is like a decentralized music platform. But I was still like, I don't know if this is going to work technically. And then it was really about a year ago where all them build their launch, their application. And it was pretty streamlined application, like you as a user who just goes to audios co you didn't have to know anything about to try, but the whole thing is running in this decentralized way and that was very inspirational to me.
00:04:31.874 - 00:05:23.250, Speaker B: So that was like made me think, okay, this is something that's going to work. And at the same time another friend build this project called Braintrust, which I think is on Polygon actually, and it's a decentralized platform for work. And I saw them get a huge amount of traction by distributing their token to this community of freelancers. And that started under here's, the power of sharing ownership among your community. And it occurred to me that if we created Twitch today, we would do it as a decentralized form. Because something that created this tremendous amount of value and a lot of that was captured in the form of kind of partner payments for streaming by the streamers. But the streamers didn't have any way to invest in the upside of the company or the project.
00:05:23.250 - 00:05:35.686, Speaker B: So that got me really excited about researching ideas and understanding markets changed bikes are getting excited about building something.
00:05:35.868 - 00:06:11.410, Speaker A: Oh, that's amazing. I think you already set up the base for the rest of the questions I had because it covers in all these themes and it's interesting because obviously the last talk also covered kind of how we think crypto will change gaming or just web Three in general. And my kind of first question to you here is, was it specifically a timing thing or was it just that you kind of just are more naturally excited about gaming and just that as a frontier? Because it's the experience with Twitch that you realize that's where the biggest opportunity is. And kind of how do you kind of think about gaming versus ownership? And are they the same to you as you kind of thought about starting fractal?
00:06:11.910 - 00:07:14.626, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there was probably like a timing of when there's a bunch of infrastructure now like Solana or Polygon or there's all this infrastructure to make I would say a higher transaction throughput application happen in crypto and those are the apps. Like things that are more consumer focused are probably what I'm naturally interested in. The DeFi stuff is very interesting but it's not really my area where I'm like okay, that's something that I want to pursue as my job. For me, I think that there was this timing where the technology now placed or creating something that's things that can be used by normal people and that was very exciting to me. Gaming specifically. I think I've watched this whole NFT rise and was a very tiny investor in OpenSea and I was like this know, really interesting and saw how inspired huge boom art market and is a way that creators know now like a new business model for creators. So that was really exciting.
00:07:14.626 - 00:08:09.334, Speaker B: And I think the next wave of NFTs was pretty clearly to me is like, NFTs that have some form of utility, and gaming is very natural as a place for that to start. Because the idea that digital assets and gaming have value has been something that's 25 night concept that's like 25 years old. I played Ultima online when I was in the was in high school and I used to sneak downstairs and play Ultima online from midnight to 05:00 A.m. When my parents were asleep. And that game was like people were buying and selling stuff in that game, like on ebay back then, other people weren't players were mind blown that anyone would value this stuff. But now that's become the predominant business model of gaming is selling stuff in a game whether that's skins in Fortnite or Counterstrike or other types of assets. That's how gaming companies monetize now.
00:08:09.334 - 00:08:29.150, Speaker B: And so to me, the next step, the natural extension is making that economy from a closed one to an open one and giving the ownership of those assets to the players so that they can not just buy them but they can also sell them or trade them. That to me is like a very obvious evolution that is going to happen over the next ten years in gaming.
00:08:30.130 - 00:08:53.430, Speaker A: I absolutely agree and I think this kind of kind of opens up a whole series of questions around just how do you think gaming and Web Three would be like? So my kind of first question there is, do you kind of believe that using blockchains or just different primitives in crypto is just a different abstraction to how games are built right now? Or do you think crypto games will be inherently entirely different from what we see from all these studios?
00:08:54.410 - 00:09:40.338, Speaker B: Well, it'd probably be a blend. I think that crypto in gaming or Web Three gaming, it's a mix of different things, like different innovations. One innovation is it's access to a new capital market. It's like a new funding model where you're selling a set of NFTs or other tokens to an audience of early supporters. And those people are oftentimes before you have a game, those people are basically pre funding the game, and they've done that for a long time. You've had games like Star Citizen or something that are starting Twelve where they've raised $400 million. Now, in terms of platform, have players get the opportunity to have some sort of real ownership in the asset.
00:09:40.338 - 00:10:22.974, Speaker B: So if the game is successful, maybe their assets increase in value, but they get something. That's one part of it. I think another part is kind of like this putting the stuff on the blockchain makes it open and programmable. And so there's going to be this open ecosystem where games create their assets as NFTs and then other people make experiences on top of them. And as a programmer, that's one I'm particularly excited about. It's like the opportunity to kind of connect all of this stuff that's online. And I think people would invent new and interesting ways and experiences and utility that can sit on top of the NFTs that are created for these games and metaverses.
00:10:22.974 - 00:10:25.780, Speaker B: And I'm really excited for that future.
00:10:26.550 - 00:10:55.070, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's one of those things where we kind of officially unlocked that world and being able to see different universes that have the same bases is an incredible theme that I think we're just seeing very basic implementation applications of. So we haven't even seen that to full capacity yet. I'm curious to kind of hear your thoughts on sort of what are some interesting ideas either you've come across or you would like to see that actually take this level of composability to some interesting experiences.
00:10:55.410 - 00:11:39.302, Speaker B: Yeah, well, there's some very obvious ones. I was just talking to founders of this company, Web, with two B's, and they let you take in your digital avatar from other PFP projects and they render them as a 2D sprite. And you could use this as your avatar in this 2D world. It's kind of like an eight bit realm like metaverse. That's kind of like an obvious one. I know other people are working on that as well for their various PFP projects, is do something like that as well. Fractal our own collection of 100,000 fractals.
00:11:39.302 - 00:12:30.162, Speaker B: So these are unique digital snowflakes with attributes, they belong to different factions with different rarities and then they have like velocity and spin altitudes. And we kind of thought of it as to be like a gaming primitive on top of which people could build various experiences. So it's everything from very simple things like certain fractals getting whitelist access to buying to certain sales. But then it's also like people building experiences like special levels or tournaments or events for fractal holders all the way through like different cosmetic upgrades within their fractal. And so I'm just starting to see that happen right now. And that's excited about is the stuff that I'm not even imagining right now. Because when something's open or programmable, people are going to create new stuff that you never would have guessed exist.
00:12:30.326 - 00:13:07.590, Speaker A: Fair enough. No, 100% in terms of kind of contrasting that with what's happening on the web two side, obviously all of us are excited about sort of gaming becoming a really nice way to bring in millions, if not hundreds of millions more people in because they understand how that works to clear engage audience. But when we talk about mass adoption, do you think scalability or maybe the transaction costs are the only barriers to entry? How would you kind of think about what's preventing right now from getting like 100 more million people trying out web3 games.
00:13:11.050 - 00:14:22.270, Speaker B: The Last Talk nailed it where it's like it's all about product and it's all about UI UX, right? So it's really how can you that's one of the innovations with Twitch and Justin TV before there was streaming on the internet before, but we made it really easy and have to install any plugin or anything like that. So I think that what I'm excited about is people are creating more ways for crypto to be easier to onboard that could look like different things. It might be custodial wallets, for example. I feel like there's a lot of things that games can do to make the UIUX just much simpler in terms of how do you onboard and actually provide some of that, provide some of those rails for users. And so I think games are a good way to do that because people are the gaming industry is highly optimized in terms of getting players on and making sure their marketing dollars are very efficient. And so I feel like that is potentially a way that millions and tens of millions of users get onboarded into.
00:14:22.420 - 00:14:40.710, Speaker A: Crypto in that world. How do you kind of think about the trade offs between the abstractions needed to sort of remove some of those UX barriers versus kind of compromising on anywhere from decentralization to the end user owning the underlying asset? I think I feel like usually we've seen them at different ends of the same kind of rope.
00:14:41.930 - 00:15:24.930, Speaker B: Right? It's a trade off, right? There's a trade off between abstractions that are forms of centralization versus decentralization. Right. And I think the question is like how much not every app needs to be fully decentralized. I mean, there's probably some evangelists who believe that to be the case, but I think that's true. Right. So if you're moving huge amounts of money in DeFi, and then perhaps you really care about the decentralization and sovereignty. But if you're playing a game where the stakes are much lower, perhaps you're willing to at first try that game in a way like where you load it through a custodial wallet provided by the game.
00:15:24.930 - 00:16:07.070, Speaker B: So you don't have to know anything about decentralization at all or crypto at all. And then once you maybe if you're very invested in that game, you're investing a lot of capital, tokens, time, whatever, then you can take that sovereignty back and take that wallet once you understand what's going on. And so I think when people create these applications, there is a little bit of a trade off, a user trade off. I mean, Coinbase is a great example. They've onboarded tens of millions of users into crypto and there's a trade off there because you're using most of those users are custodying their crypto at Coinbase.
00:16:08.950 - 00:16:26.440, Speaker A: We don't have to expect everybody to kind of do this too. And as long as they have a choice, they get to kind of pick the experience they want either as well. No, I agree. Does that matter to you for fractal? Or how do you kind of envision people who are fractal users kind of experience this?
00:16:27.290 - 00:17:14.374, Speaker B: I think what's interesting about NFTs, like in general and then gaming NFTs, is that by putting something on a blockchain, it's effectively like it's almost like an asset backed by blockchain. Right. A lot of these assets, they're not going to be successful if the game itself is not successful and they don't create a client that does something with this asset. And so there is a point of centralization that's really important, right, which is this initial game. Eventually maybe the set of assets will become big enough that they exist beyond one game experience and so they have some durable value there. But I think of the blockchain component at first as a way it's kind of like how US dollar was backed by gold and that might give people confidence to invest in this as a currency to use it. Right.
00:17:14.374 - 00:17:55.380, Speaker B: And from that there's probably different philosophical views on good idea or not. But I think the idea that you put your assets on watch, I think is this way to give people confidence in like they have ownership and that gives them the play to participate in this market or this economy, this game ecosystem. To me, that's kind of like the important part. It's more ideological than it is technology. Actually, I think.
00:17:57.610 - 00:18:39.300, Speaker A: That'S a really interesting way to kind of think about it. I guess in that world it's sort of related, but not in a directly related but do you feel like the nature of everything being able to be priced or resold or repackaged in some form, whether it's creatively or not, affects kind of the nature of the games themselves? Do you think everything becomes too transactional and people don't play things for fun because they think there's money to be made or not made or lost or sold here? And do you think the second we start valuing everything that ideally we couldn't to the full extent in the web two kind of anything from ruins to diminishes the gaming experience?
00:18:39.830 - 00:19:24.974, Speaker B: Well, I have two thoughts on that. One is that before a couple of years ago, before there were any blockchain games, games were primarily played for fun, right? There's probably a scale of like and they were mostly fun and maybe there was a little bit of economic activity. There are a few people who are selling World of Warcraft gold on ebay or something, but mostly people were playing for fun. 99% of players. And then now with blockchain games, some of these early games like Axio Infinity, maybe people are playing more. There's a huge contingent of people who are playing as a job, right? And maybe if they weren't able to make money off of it, they wouldn't play the game or some percentage of them wouldn't play the game. I think what will happen is the games will shift back to be more fun.
00:19:24.974 - 00:20:23.250, Speaker B: Most people will be playing for fun, like maybe 80%, and then 20% of it will be like, oh, if I want to play a different game, I can sell the stuff in this game, right? There's some economic component of it, but it's not their primary reason for participating in this gaming universe. I think that's like the end state because most people do want to play games for fun. I think. So we'll see this shift back as the games become more better experiences, right? We're in this very early phase of blockchain gaming. It's kind of like free to play in 2008 where the free play games that were on social networks like Facebook, these games were more they were viral, but there was a lot of criticism of them. But because by real gamers, because they were saying gamers would say this isn't a fun game, it's a wonky business model, I don't believe in it. And now 14 years later, that's the predominant business model of gaming and you have games that are much more immersive experiences like Fortnite that are built on a free play model.
00:20:23.250 - 00:21:43.034, Speaker B: So I think blockchain is going to go through blockchain games that will go through a similar transition. The last thing you said is like the financialization point which I didn't address. So do games become less fun as everything becomes has the ability to be financialized within the game? I don't think in these blockchain games, first of all, I don't think every asset or every interaction will be like something that can be monetized or turned into an NFT. Oftentimes what I've seen is people are there's some core assets that are NFTs in the game like your player or your avatar, like some major things but then there's a lot of stuff that's interaction in the game that are not monetized. And I think that with these games I kind of think about the creation of the car, the automobile, right? Like in the early 19 hundreds we created these cars and people bought them and then there's this whole industry of financialization that popped up around it, right? Like you could get a loan for a car then and then you can rent your car out or people would buy cars and rent them out at airports or whatever. Or you could rent your car out on get around and turn it into an asset. Or you can get a loan against your car right, and use it as collateral.
00:21:43.034 - 00:22:13.000, Speaker B: And so I think that gaming assets will go through a similar it's a really good transition. Yeah. Where gaming assets started off as like there's just something you have, right, you buy to play but then eventually if it's something that's valued by other people then it's programmable, it's online, it's easy to do all this financialization around, people will create all these different methods of financialization and that's going to be pretty exciting. I don't know, but it's interesting.
00:22:13.850 - 00:22:48.898, Speaker A: That's a really good analogy because I think I'm also by the way, I'mixing some questions in the audience. So for the audience, feel free to just type any questions and I'll be able to ask them and merge them in with a list of our questions. But there's a question around just how do economies work in crypto? Because we've seen games that have immensely Tweaked and kind of curated economies for how their in world works. But now you get to interact with everything else too. So you're basically thinking like a virtual country, a set of countries and all these kind of parameters that we understand real world can be applied. We haven't seen them to most extents, but it's kind of becoming popular. So this car analogy works really well.
00:22:48.898 - 00:23:32.080, Speaker A: That's a really good way to think about it. I want to kind of get to an interesting point which is our kind of topic here, which is understanding the role of existing game studios and web Two sort of game publishers. We've kind of seen a handful of them kind of talk about or sort of hint they're thinking about doing NFTs or just think about web Three in general and it's just kind of come with massive resistance from whoever's online. Basically the question is, I'm not asking to comment on any of that, but it's more of how do you think they get to adapt what they should adapt or maybe what their role becomes in this world. Will they be forced to transition, do you think? We'll just get dethroned by Web Three Native things or just what happens in this point that we're at?
00:23:32.450 - 00:24:39.482, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we've seen this movie before, right? Like with Free Play, when Free Play started off and then Mobile was kind of the next was the real catalyst of this. At first, all the successful games were New Entrants, right? It's an innovator's dilemma, right? You have these incumbents, they're like, we're making all this money making games for Xbox or PC or whatever. Do we really care about mobile? It's kind of nascent. And then New Entrants start up the Zyngas of the world and then people those become successful companies and then the incumbents are like, okay, we need to pay attention. And I think the same thing will happen with blockchain games where the incumbents get all this criticism because their players are like, oh, that's not serious, that's not gaming, that's not what we know, right? People are resistant to change and so they'll be like, players will traditional companies like, oh, we're going to sell NFTs. And then players are like, this is a cash grab, this is bad for the environment. There's all these lists of criticisms, right, and New Entrants, there's a ton of people who are game developers from big studios.
00:24:39.482 - 00:25:02.270, Speaker B: They're from Riot or EA or Activision, and they're transitioning. They left their jobs to build something that's a blockchain game and they don't have that innovators dilemma, right? They have nothing to lose. So they're going to go out and create these new games and then some of those games will become incredibly successful. And then in five years, we'll see the incumbents kind of just bite the bullet and they'll participate.
00:25:03.170 - 00:25:37.560, Speaker A: Got you. And I guess if I were to kind of analyze and just see if I can tie this into something you said earlier, it seems like one of the things that sort of eases people's kind of opinions on this. Is if they have a great experience in a great game, then sort of makes it easy for somebody to like. Okay, maybe you should consider this. And we just haven't seen too many of those moments. They're coming and we're seeing hints of what's kind of happening, but seems like it's anytime soon. Kind of the window of opportunity and maybe we'll get a bigger crack to turn over.
00:25:38.650 - 00:26:20.518, Speaker B: This whole industry is like, I mean, I know Axe got started in 2018, but it's like one year old, really? Because it started accelerating like a year ago, right? Or maybe 18 months ago, something like that. So it takes time to make a game, right? If you want to make a good game, it takes like a year or more. These games are coming. If you are in the industry, if you kind of peel back the curtain, you're like talking to people in the industry. There's a tremendous amount of talent that's coming to this industry, but there's a lag time refractal we conceived of it in November, release it a month later. Right. Because it's a website and we have an amazing team.
00:26:20.518 - 00:26:35.580, Speaker B: We built it, but we couldn't have built a full AAA game in like a year. Right. So it's going to take some time. So I think these transitions seem to happen. They seem slow, but then it'll be all of a sudden, I think.
00:26:36.270 - 00:26:56.930, Speaker A: Absolutely. I have a question from the audience, and I'll kind of just phrase it out there. I think it's a little bit abstract, so I'll kind of give you room to parse. But how do you think about copyright ownership in this world? And sort of do you think that's going to end up either being a barrier or an issue as people think about IPS for these assets?
00:26:57.670 - 00:27:25.002, Speaker B: Yeah, so obviously just having an NFT of something doesn't necessarily necessitate a certain level of copyright ownership. Right. And I think projects have tried to do different things, right. Like whether maybe they're reserving them, maybe they're granting those to the NFT holder. I think what we'll see is every game is going to want to become a platform with their NFTs. Right. I don't know if they know that right now, but they will eventually, because.
00:27:25.136 - 00:27:26.666, Speaker A: That answers my prediction question.
00:27:26.768 - 00:28:07.222, Speaker B: Yeah. If you become a platform and people start building experiences on top of your game or your game NFTs, then the durability of those assets is higher and kind of the value of your ecosystem goes up. Right. And so the question is, like, what legal framework is going to encourage the most of other people building on top of your stuff while preserving value for your ecosystem? Right. I don't know what that is, but it depends on like, if I'm a developer and I'm going to build on someone else's IP, what assurances do I need, what protections do I need? I think that's what the framework people should be using to think about it.
00:28:07.276 - 00:28:48.514, Speaker A: It's also an interesting edge case from what you just talked about, which is of course it's in the best interest for the game to build a platform for their users and kind of give more, but they largely also will have a separate parallel universe that's built by others which can equally be more successful or just successful. And I don't think we've seen too many of those scenarios in Web Two yet. And the times we've seen that actually just ends with like a clear way for somebody to just kick them off the platform. And we have a bunch of those things. So I feel like that's one thing where I just noticed that that's going to be a new one, where we don't know what that looks like, where somebody can build a better platform than you can using your own assets or user base.
00:28:48.632 - 00:29:24.926, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean, the point of Web Three is that you have a way to benefit from that. Right. If you hold. Back, you're selling NFTs, you hold back some amount or you have an open token, you're holding some in your treasury. If you create something that is an open ecosystem that creates value, then you can benefit from that. And I think that's really interesting because we saw in Web Two, and as part of that is there's a lot of promises by companies saying, oh, we're an open ecosystem, but there was no way that that was actually they had complete control over whether that was true or not, right? And so that was true until they decided it wasn't true. Right.
00:29:24.926 - 00:29:37.086, Speaker B: If you were Twitter, you could build a client, or if you were on Twitter, you could build a client and build all sorts of different ways to build on top of Twitter until they decided they were like, oh, this is actually suboptimal for our business with Facebook.
00:29:37.198 - 00:29:37.860, Speaker A: And.
00:29:40.390 - 00:30:19.742, Speaker B: It'S true for all these know, and it's probably only not true for Twitch because we weren't early enough to really build it as a platform. To be honest. I think that what's interesting to me about Web Three, and what I love about it is it's kind of like there was a way for it to be you to be economically incentive to create an open platform. Right. The things that are successful are primarily platforms and it's an alignment to create the open. I think that's important because that's the internet that we want to be part of is one where anyone can build on top of what's out there. I think I think that's the best for innovation.
00:30:19.742 - 00:30:21.730, Speaker B: It's the best for the consumer.
00:30:23.830 - 00:30:52.510, Speaker A: I totally agree. I think this is one of those things where it's going to be hard to imagine what we can't imagine yet. And obviously there's a catch in that sentence alone and we're just seeing what people are going to do with this. I want to end on a final question, which is there's over 1000 developers here that are considering going into Web Three from their existing Web Two jobs. And that's not a small number. Obviously a lot of them are just seeing what's possible. It's a two three day hackathon, but a lot of them are also considering full time and think about what they might be able to do.
00:30:52.510 - 00:31:03.646, Speaker A: Do you have any advice for people who are sort of thinking about getting into Web Three? Kind of comforting this with your transition or anything you want to think about for how they should think about building businesses here? What would you kind of tell them?
00:31:03.828 - 00:31:48.080, Speaker B: Yeah, well, first of all, you should come work at Fractal. So Fractal is hit me on my Twitter DMs. But seriously, if you're not working on Web Three yet, I just don't know what you're doing. It's very obvious to me that this is the most exciting part of the internet. I think there's a lot of innovation. Like when I started on Web Two, it was like we were redefining defining how people would interact socially on the Internet back in 20 05 20 06 20 07 20 08 and now it's being defined how people will regard value on the Internet. And that's pretty cool.
00:31:48.080 - 00:32:28.630, Speaker B: It's a place where you can experiment and see what happens. And then there's obviously all these financial motivations to do it as well. But I think for me, I'm someone who's always primarily followed my curiosity, and that's why I'm excited about Web Three. So I would do it for sure, and then just like, it's a great time to get started. There's plenty of companies to work for, lots of different places to innovate. I think one good area to look is like, what are the marketplaces markets that will be disrupted by distributing the value to a large group of people? That's kind of how I was thinking about it when I kind of came up with fractal. So yeah.
00:32:28.630 - 00:32:29.722, Speaker B: Good luck.
00:32:29.906 - 00:32:33.934, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Justin, thank you so much for your time and really appreciate this.
00:32:34.132 - 00:32:35.550, Speaker B: Amazing. Thank you.
00:32:35.620 - 00:32:36.220, Speaker A: Great, thanks.
