00:00:06.170 - 00:00:28.870, Speaker A: Hello, good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Depending where you're calling from. We have Anton here from Aurora doing a workshop on guide to Aurora EVM for builders. If you have any questions, they can go into the Zoom chat and Anton will be more than happy to answer them throughout the presentation. And with that being said, I will hand off the mic to our speaker.
00:00:30.490 - 00:01:40.506, Speaker B: Hello everyone, nice to be here. Anna, thank you for the intro. Yes, my name is Anton, I work at Aurora. I am overseeing all the integrations that are happening with the chain and ensuring that it all goes towards builders having as bespoke and league experience as possible while building on Aurora. Now it won't be kind of like too technical deep under the hood presentation instead, because with all the AVM scaling solutions on the market first of all, what we are here for is to help scale ethereum ecosystem. And therefore we also firm believers that the future is multi chain and this presentation is in the first place for me to kind of raise awareness of how Aurora is different, why you should be interested in it and so on. So first of all, I think it would be nice to start with just some overview of what the Aurora community achieved so far.
00:01:40.506 - 00:02:32.720, Speaker B: So we were at 2.5 bill TBL before the market crash. We are at 2.5 million transactions per week, more than 150 applications launched on Aurora within the nine months from the launch. We have Ether Scan, we have Infuriated better yet, but still you can get your PCML from Infuria which will be updated soon, have MetaMask institutional, we have Graph, Covalent, NASA, Save Ethereum. Basically a lot of the ecosystem projects and infrastructure projects that you would expect to have navM compatible chain are already here. Bashan and arguably into native laden protocols on Aurora end up with zero bad debt with the market crash, which is not that often.
00:02:32.720 - 00:03:48.306, Speaker B: We also had Moonflower farmers thing happening that back in the day with Sunflower farmers took down some of the networks. They did not break Aurora when it was on Aurora. We also working more and more on the native near Aurora interpretations and as a result we already have refinance that already has swaps on Aurora. Therpetovirus we have Aurora bots biomarker collection that we launch together with our Aurora Plus product that I will mention in the Deep as well as one of the most desired and popular collection on Aurora and New. And we have more than ten projects on Aurora ecosystem that already closed their finding route. Now let's get to what Aurora is and how Aurora works, which is the most interesting part for you I would imagine. So, first of all, Aurora is a VM compatibility layer on top of near Aurora is built as a smart contract.
00:03:48.306 - 00:05:25.446, Speaker B: So it's a regular near smart contract that has NVM inside Aurora RPC are web3 compatible RPC that works as you would expect from Ethereum and it's basically a rap Near PC. So as a result, what you get is just like you can utilize all the power and features of near with Ethereum interface which we find is pretty cool. And back in the day it was an idea to try it out and no one thought that you can actually put an EVM inside of a smart contract and that would not only work but also perform very well. But that's what happened. And together with that from near we get the 1 second block time around 1 second, but around 1 second block time, two blocks finality time. And yeah, also one of the things that we have been working on in the past nine months was optimizing the gas usage because as a result of having a block time as 1 second we get that it's the computation time basically. So it also defines the maximum amount of computation that can happen and therefore it's not like on Ethereum is 14 seconds and on near and on error is 1 second.
00:05:25.446 - 00:06:27.378, Speaker B: So we also had to work a lot on optimizing on how much computation can happen and we actually got to very good results with that. And at this stage we still do see sometimes the maximum guess error but it's quite rare and in almost all the cases it can be optimized for. So yeah, as a result we have the 1 second block time basically without any compromises. We also have all the Ethereum Ecosystem tools available on Aurora which would be like MetaMask, Raffle, Hardware, Remix, et cetera. And basically anything that is EVM compatible can be easily and quickly integrated with Aurora. A very interesting thing and important in our opinion is that the base token on Aurora is actually Ethereum. And I will talk a bit more in detail about how it works later in the presentation.
00:06:27.378 - 00:07:57.890, Speaker B: But the belief here is that scaling Ethereum ecosystem you don't want to introduce any extra thing that would not work as you would expect on Ethereum because it's all originated, of course. Now a lot of projects just start building on Aurora natively, et cetera. But the overall idea, I believe with anyone who is working on similar kind of solutions is to scale theater maker system and therefore, in our opinion, the closer you get to the experience the better. And basically as a result you can just add an extra RPC endpoint where to deploy your contract you can deploy away and it would just work as you would expect it on a thing. Yeah, we also are working on we have a very strong product lab within Aurora and we are working on with a very strong focus on UX and we are working on launching we already launched a few of the products apart from Aurora being an infrastructure itself but we're also working on the next ones. But the two ones that are already live are Aurora Plus which is a staking platform that is meant to become a wallet in the future. And I will also talk about it a little bit after that.
00:07:57.890 - 00:08:41.650, Speaker B: And we also have the Rainbow Bridge, which is a very cool bridge and it's all the time complemented as a bridge with the best user experience. Now a bit more about the bridge. It's a trustless permissionless generic bridge with Ethereum. FTX was not hacked. We have a fork in bug bounty program alive that we already did the second largest bug bounty payout in history. And we also have the system that automatically resists attacks. And it's already worked twice on attacks and prevented.
00:08:41.650 - 00:09:44.550, Speaker B: So and Aurora Plus, you can see the fact you can stake Aurora and you can get rewards. And rewards you get are not only Aurora tokens, but it's also the tokens from the ecosystem project. The idea, like one of the key ideas behind Aurora Plus is to bring the web two familiarity and remove the web3 hurdles from users who just start interacting with blockchain. And we do that by having the freemium model with subscriptions. So every user that signs up for Aurora Plus has 50 free transactions per month. They will be able in the future to have subscription plans, to have more transactions per month, and just to basically pay with a credit card. And don't ever think about the gas fees, however small they are.
00:09:44.550 - 00:10:45.850, Speaker B: They still mean that if you have gas fees, you still need to have Ethereum on your wallet, et cetera, et cetera. And this is just simply not a familiar concept for the web to use. And yeah, it will also allow third parties to pay for the use of transactions now. Okay, so back to east as a base token how it works. So user signs a transaction, for instance, with MetaMask and Ethereum transaction, then the RPC wraps the transaction into a new transaction, send wraps, transaction unwraps, it commits the transaction on new and yeah, that's what happens. And the result I'm not sure what I wanted to tell more about. This is very self explanatory.
00:10:45.850 - 00:11:50.240, Speaker B: Yes. So we also have a community grant program that altogether, we have a lot of things to kind of enable and enable projects on Aurora, projects from ecosystem new projects that are building projects that are existing and that want to expand to Aurora. So we have various ways of support, we help and we work with various marketing efforts. We have a grants program which is of course very we also move for that program to become not just grants program, but the community grants program. That's what this slide is about. You can inspect it thoroughly if you want. But the idea is to first of all, enable the project that want to build on Aurora to build and for the community to also to see it as transparent as possible.
00:11:50.240 - 00:12:18.780, Speaker B: We also do for projects our grand scheme analyzed projects we can do, interest to VCs that would be a good match for the project and so on. Now, this is mostly what I wanted to cover. I hope to get more questions and in the meantime I will. Yeah.
00:12:21.870 - 00:12:32.640, Speaker A: All right. Yeah. Like Anton said, if you have any questions, definitely feel free to ask them now and you can come off mute if that's easier for you.
00:12:38.620 - 00:13:35.540, Speaker B: Infuria. Yes. So with Infuria basically, let me tell you a little bit about what we were working recently and I feel like I know what that question is. We were for the past also kind of six to eight months, we've been working on the new infrastructure that we will talk more about at the Neurcon. And also I invite everyone to join Neurcon that starts on Sunday and I will type the URL in the chat and we'll get back to the Infuria question. So yes, we will have more announcement and we will talk more about various stuff at Nukon. Infura won't yet be a part of that announcement because we're still in bet with Infuria.
00:13:35.540 - 00:14:31.420, Speaker B: And the reason for that, that we have our own infrastructure developed recently that is not yet public. At the same time, we are finishing up with the public RPC kind of node package that as we had previously. We will have an updated one now and Infuriate will use that. Once they switch to that one, the better will kind of be in the latest stages more and you will be able to request goods that are not from there. But in the meantime, yes, but I would still recommend using our public infrastructure for now in the first place because it's not overloaded. It's a very optimized one. We are releasing a few important upgrades to it tomorrow.
00:14:31.420 - 00:14:39.630, Speaker B: But yeah, you can use unfurl, but not yet, like at your own risk for now.
00:14:45.300 - 00:14:49.810, Speaker A: All right, just going to wait a couple more seconds for any other questions to roll in.
00:14:53.820 - 00:15:27.990, Speaker B: It will be available as a video and I will also prepare a few more links that I want to share to the Grants program, to more in depth documentation and to more things about like we have good videos explaining how Aurora works and some other specifics about multicol. I need to check with the text team more in detail. I think it's coming, but I can't tell you straight away.
00:15:32.980 - 00:16:01.832, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, I guess we can just end things there then. Yeah. Anton, thank you so much for taking the time to do this workshop for the ETH Online hackers. And thank you to all of you who joined in to listen to Anton speak and learn more about Aurora. Yeah, like Anton said, this recording will be available on YouTube for reference after, so feel free to go back at any time. And also the Aurora team is available for support throughout the hackathon.
00:16:01.832 - 00:16:12.990, Speaker A: The sponsor. Aurora Discord Channel in the ETH online. Discord? Yeah, and with that being said, once again, thank you all, and I hope you all have a great rest of your day.
00:16:13.760 - 00:16:21.980, Speaker B: Thank you. Everyone very excited to see what you will build on Aurora. And, yes, have a lovely hack.
00:16:22.880 - 00:16:23.370, Speaker A: Bye, everyone.
