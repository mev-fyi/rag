00:00:06.570 - 00:00:23.070, Speaker A: Okay. Hi everyone. Good morning, afternoon and evening, depending on where you are. I'm Cree from East Global. With us. We have Jeffrey from Phil Fox. He will be giving his workshop on the progress of Phil Fox and FNS.
00:00:23.070 - 00:00:49.322, Speaker A: And we will say if you have questions, feel free to put them in the chat. Jeffrey will read them towards the end of his workshop. And then of course, we can always open it up for questions. If you want to come off mute and ask them, we can do that. Maybe like the last five minutes of the workshop. Just remember to go on mute when you guys join. And yeah, Jeffrey, feel free to take it away.
00:00:49.322 - 00:00:50.810, Speaker A: I'll go off camera.
00:00:52.270 - 00:00:52.634, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:52.672 - 00:01:34.090, Speaker C: Thank you. Hey guys, this is Jeff from Fifox. Super glad to be here and share you guys with our latest progress of both PhilFox and so today's topic would be Phil Fox latest progress and FNS and key features. And also I'll tell a little bit more about the FNS future plan. So I'll start with the few folks. So I just did a quick intro about the team. First, we originated from the filecoin developer community and we have been working closely with the filecoin team since testnet.
00:01:34.090 - 00:02:20.878, Speaker C: Our currently product includes web three tools for Fox Explorer and Fox Wallet. We also got applications like FNS and we are also developing CKP mining power marketplace for finance purposes. For traffic wise, we have accumulated huge traffic from Fewfox Explorer and Fox Wallet. The charts. We have put some pictures here and you can show the real data of both tools. Fuel Fox has more than 80 active users over the past 30 days and Fox Wallet just exceed 20K dau. And next one is about the latest update about Fuel Fox.
00:02:20.878 - 00:03:22.798, Speaker C: So lately we devoted ourselves to the development of FVM ecology and won the Ficoin EVM Building Blocks Award with FNS in hackson, in Fevm hacksaw. And lately with user programming ability approaching early this year, we are going to update Filfox to show activities and interactions involving user defined actors. So a few important updates here. We will launch actors display such as WASM and Fevm Bytecode Abis and supporting for all address classes. Also includes F four addresses. We are going to display event log and transaction state and finish the contract source code verification. Also, we noticed that some platforms and projects are using PhilFox Explorer to capturing data.
00:03:22.798 - 00:04:23.700, Speaker C: So in order to build a better filecoin ecosystem, we will soon release a guide about how to make Filfox Explorer API calls and make the process a lot easier for you guys to use the links here. You guys can check the documents. All right, this is pretty much about the field fox and next I'll share you guys a bit more about the FNS. Simply put, FNS is the decentralized Fi coin name service based on FVM. You may consider it as the ENS in the Ficoin ecosystem, but we have developed more functions on it. We hope that the launch of NFT will help to improve the user experiences in the situations right now. And FNS is ERC seven to one standard.
00:04:23.700 - 00:05:15.250, Speaker C: Each FNS name is treated as NFT and the FNS contract compiles with all interfaces of the ERC seven to one standard and can be transferred and traded on secondary NFT markets the function. We have put a picture, a flow chart here and you guys can check how it works. The functions included registry, resolver, controller, et cetera. We will also provide the Miner name service which we call it MNS. It is a resolution from the name to the miner. The owner of a miner in five coin protocol can configure name resolution for the miner. Users can use the storage services provided by miners through an easily identifinable domain with tools compatible with FNS.
00:05:15.250 - 00:06:07.460, Speaker C: Furthermore, the FNS name can be resolved to an order CID, which will be the first step to realizing the decentralized storage index services. Yeah, moving to the next one. So here we list like three main features of FNS. FNS provides better user experiences that comes with the use of the file domain. Anyone can index on on chain addresses, contents and storage with simple characters. And our team will implement a function using onchain storage to search filecoin actors as well. On top of that, we will launch the FNS space so users can freely create the FNS web three space for transparency, friendship and more.
00:06:07.460 - 00:07:47.250, Speaker C: Talking about the FNS space, our team is quite excited about this feature since as a web three user myself, I personally need a decentralized protocol to connect my on chain and off chain data. With the help of the FNS protocol, users can create their personalized brand portals on FNS spaces, use filecoin and IPFS storage space to store and display their exploration of the web three world in a decentralized manner at the same time through FNS poso. We call it like the protocol of Society protocol. It can verify web two identity influence to the web three world and the FNS protocol. We also launched the five coin soul scan services. Users can find web three friends more suitable for themselves based on FNS basis, like we were searching the same hobbits or you participate in the same ecosystem, et cetera to match some friends for you. So the picture beside shows how the or functionality works so users can configure their profile on the space dashboard such as nickname, logo, occupation and the configured information will be generated as a web file and uploaded to the IPFS and it will also be sent as a deal to the ficoin network to be packaged to sectors.
00:07:47.250 - 00:08:59.702, Speaker C: The user's signature binds IPFS and the ficoin order CID to the resolution of the user subdomain name and the user can assess the space through the subdomain name. At the same time, your space will also update some metadata to the user's SBT. This is pretty much about the FNS space. So we conclude that Fire provides individuals and organizations with unique filecoin field brand domain names. It also combines like FNS and DMs domain services for creating a seamless link between the users and the miners while being able to display their web Two and Web Three social identities. In addition, it comes with a Web Three space for all the dot five registered users where various size of identity aspects are presented and the source game facilitates users interrelations and internet connections. So we also got some future plans for the FNS for the short term.
00:08:59.702 - 00:10:01.310, Speaker C: Most important one is to open source the audited name service contract code and provide a complete deployment and development solution. Some of the functions we have already been developing right now like name search and the details display in Firefox Explorer. We have put some pictures there to show how it works and also Fox Wallet will also complete the FNS transfer and search function. Users can use the FNS dam to transfer field and tokens. This will improve the user experience as well. And for the long terms we'll put all the time and effort into developing FNS space. We hope to create decentralized personal proto and did system for web Three users based on the Ficoin FVN and build a bass blockchain as a service flexible tool with completely decentralized identities and data storage.
00:10:01.310 - 00:10:19.620, Speaker C: Yeah, this is my sharings today. Thanks for listening. By the way, FNS is now running on Testnet. The website is below, it's shown as below, just feel free to try it out. Also if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
00:10:20.070 - 00:10:23.234, Speaker B: Yeah, awesome.
00:10:23.352 - 00:10:48.170, Speaker A: Thanks so much Jeffrey. Yeah everyone, if you didn't see Jeffrey's teammate Stephen just dropped all the links in the chat that you might need. So be sure to go check those out. Also if anyone has any questions, feel free to drop them in the chat right now or raise your oh we'll have one for Henry. Jeffrey, if you see that one. Or Stephen.
00:10:49.950 - 00:10:52.400, Speaker C: Yeah, probably Stephen. You're going to answer that?
00:10:53.330 - 00:11:01.120, Speaker A: Stephen? Feel free to come off mute and read the questions and answers just so everyone can hear them. And also so they're on.
00:11:06.950 - 00:11:54.530, Speaker C: The FNS. We have more functionalities, as I mentioned before, we have more functionalities comparing with ENS and installable domains because right now ENS we don't see any spaces like website spaces or personal profile. It didn't launch any functionalities like that, but we'll do this in the later stage and we also have some connections like functions will launch very soon. On the Firefox Explorer you can put your domains in the search bar and in the Firefox Explorer it will shows all the information about the miners and about the addresses.
00:11:59.350 - 00:11:59.858, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:11:59.944 - 00:12:11.320, Speaker A: And then it looks like we have another question from Scott. He says will contract validation work with the same either scan like tools or will there be a different process.
00:12:13.450 - 00:12:19.470, Speaker C: This might goes to Stephen. I guess the contract side is Stephen.
00:12:19.570 - 00:12:20.220, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:20.670 - 00:12:45.410, Speaker D: For the solidity contract, we will adopt a similar form, just as the scan do. Yes. And about the welcome code, such as the Rust, maybe we will consider a new verification method. It's up to the function of the yeah. And the WASM requirements.
00:12:48.810 - 00:12:49.542, Speaker B: Okay, awesome.
00:12:49.596 - 00:12:55.880, Speaker A: And then one from Nick. Can we integrate into our contract the Fill space?
00:12:58.730 - 00:13:31.780, Speaker D: Yeah, we will release the SDK for the FAS and you can integrate the FAS to your project. And when we finish the development of the FS space, and we will release the Doc and the API for FS space, and you can integrate it in your own project and maybe some yeah.
00:13:35.290 - 00:13:35.750, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:35.820 - 00:14:00.200, Speaker A: Awesome. And then Amareza sorry if I butchered that name. Just had trouble forking it. Wondering if there's a problem with the code or forking is not compatible. Maybe that's one for the Discord, just so they can dig into it a bit more. And then.
00:14:03.070 - 00:14:31.710, Speaker D: About the hard fork. Our Explorer is developing the new code to support it. And the RPC now is living for the new chain. But the function of Explorer will be online tomorrow.
00:14:33.190 - 00:14:33.970, Speaker A: Okay, awesome.
00:14:34.040 - 00:14:34.322, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:34.376 - 00:14:44.790, Speaker A: Check back tomorrow. And then I guess, like one last question. They just wanted to confirm that the bill domains URL is the correct one for claiming.
00:14:49.850 - 00:14:51.670, Speaker C: Yes, Steven, just put the domain.
00:14:52.570 - 00:14:53.320, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:14:54.090 - 00:14:55.240, Speaker B: Okay, awesome.
00:14:55.770 - 00:14:56.518, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:14:56.684 - 00:14:57.254, Speaker B: Well, yeah.
00:14:57.292 - 00:15:19.562, Speaker A: If anyone else has any questions, last call for it. Otherwise, I think Jeffrey, Stephen, if you can drop all of these links in your Discord Channel. That way people have access to them if they weren't here and checking the chat. And then yeah. If anyone else has any other questions, feel free to check out their Discord Channel. And Jeffrey. Steven.
00:15:19.562 - 00:15:21.054, Speaker A: Thanks for joining us.
00:15:21.252 - 00:15:23.120, Speaker C: All right, thanks for having us.
00:15:23.570 - 00:15:25.290, Speaker B: Bye, everyone. Bye.
