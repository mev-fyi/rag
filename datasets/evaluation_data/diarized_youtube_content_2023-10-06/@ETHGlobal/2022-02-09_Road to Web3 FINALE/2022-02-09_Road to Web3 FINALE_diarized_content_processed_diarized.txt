00:03:52.130 - 00:04:19.038, Speaker A: You. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening everybody. My name is Kartik, one of the co founders of Egobal, and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the Road to Web Three finale. So let's get started. You're all watching this on efgobal TV. This is the platform we're using for live streaming this whole thing. Which means if you have any questions or comments, you can just put them in the chat and we'll be able to relay them to everybody on the live stream as well as answer any questions for you.
00:04:19.038 - 00:04:51.814, Speaker A: And on top of that, for everybody who signs in and says hi and engages with us, we'll be giving out NFT Poaps for being an active participant for this event. So this event has been brought to you by Ethgobal. And for those of you who don't know what ETH Global is, ETH Global is an organization with a very simple goal. Our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem. And we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits. And this event is no different as this is the final day of our Road to Web Three hackathon. So let's talk about this event.
00:04:51.814 - 00:05:40.150, Speaker A: We've had over 1200 attendees participate as hackers. They're designers, product people, developers from all over the world. Over 1000 people watch the summit we did last Thursday, and the hackers are coming in from 84 different countries spanning 20 different time zones. It's been an incredible, amazing set of people that have come on and worked on really cool things over the past five days. And we are excited to show you everything that came out of this event. We put everybody on a map to see where everybody was coming in from and it blows our mind every time we see these things that we have representation from six different continents and so many incredible cities and so many incredible perspectives that kind of were part of this event and built something that they personally cared about. And we'll be seeing some of these projects live shortly.
00:05:40.150 - 00:06:50.906, Speaker A: On top of that, we had over 60 ecosystem mentors and ten ecosystem partners that were here with us the entire time, helping out all the attendees with their projects, unblocking them, as well as giving them advice on how they can make their lives easier by using various SDKs and open source libraries. And to top it all off, this event had over $250,000 in prizes. And we'll be going into who won what prizes and how everybody can see which prizes they ended up winning at the end. So the thing that made this event super interesting was that this event was specifically designed to bring on Web Two developers into Web Three. And out of the 1200 people that participated in this event, 65% of them were brand new to Web Three. They were looking at anywhere from quitting their jobs to get into Web Three or exploring web3 so they can think about moving into this space full time. And that absolutely blew our minds because there were so many incredible seasoned developers with anywhere from industry background to decades of experience building cool things in web two and services that you probably use on a day to day basis.
00:06:50.906 - 00:08:02.766, Speaker A: And now they're excited about what's happening in web3. And we're equally thrilled to have them here playing and experimenting with incredible projects. And the thing that blew our mind was we had 310 submissions for this hackathon. This is an absolute incredible number of projects to see over a three and a half day window. And with this number, I am super excited to say that this has now been ETH global's biggest event ever in our four year history, not only from the number of participants, but also from the number of just the sheer number of incredible projects that came out of it. What gets me even more excited is that we'll be seeing so many of these projects continue to be built after this event ends today, and we are on track to bring on more and thousands more people into this ecosystem. Also want to quickly thank Polygon and our partners, including Web three OD sequence chain link, the Graph Morales Swingerspop Grants program, NFT port, superfluid and covalent.
00:08:02.766 - 00:08:50.980, Speaker A: For being incredible ecosystem partners for us for this entire event. They were there the entire time trying to make sure that everybody is able to continue building their projects and get the help that they need. And they all also gave out a lot of prizes, and we'll be covering who won what prizes at the very end. So let's go back to these 310 submissions. After these projects were submitted, they went through a judging process two days ago where we had 24 set of incredible judges. Come on and talk to these teams, give feedback, ask questions, and kind of do the hard work of figuring out how we should think about who are some of the projects we're super excited about. And through that process, we landed on 15 incredible projects that we're going to bring on today.
00:08:50.980 - 00:09:13.260, Speaker A: And they're going to come on a live demo. And these are our finalists. And before we get into that, I want to bring on Sandeep, the co founder of Polygon, to come and share a few words because this has been an incredible event in partnership with Polygon. And before we introduce these 15 teams, I'd like to bring on Sandeep and have him share a few thoughts. So welcome.
00:09:14.270 - 00:10:02.490, Speaker B: Thanks, Karthik, for having me here. Hello, everyone. Once again, thanks for having me at the closing ceremony of road to web3 hackathon. I hope you all had a great time in building your projects for this hackathon. As Karthik also mentioned that the primary goal of this hackathon was to help the excited or interested web two developers to get started in web3 ecosystem. And I'm really happy and that I got to know that 65% to 70% of all the participants in these hackathons were previously Web Two developers and were participating in a Web Three hackathon or doing things in Web Three for the first time. So that's really encouraging.
00:10:02.490 - 00:11:03.178, Speaker B: And it was also great to see the response that we received from this hackathon. As Karthik also mentioned, we also did not realize that this Polygon hackathon or in partnership with ETH Global is going to be like the biggest ever, 300 plus submissions and things like that. Absolutely amazing. And within 72 hours, some of the projects that you guys have churned out is like absolutely mind boggling. We are going to have some of the other presentations right now, so that's why I don't want to say some of the names, but I hope all of you guys learned a lot. And more importantly, you guys will continue your Web Three journey forward. And we at Polygon, the cultural value within us is that we are at the service of developers to help them to continue and to build their amazing Web Three journeys.
00:11:03.178 - 00:11:39.138, Speaker B: So anytime you want to expand onto your ideas, make it into a venture going forward or learn more and things like that, we are always there and we are at your service. And the hackathon also had multiple gaming tracks. Multiple tracks like NFTs gaming. DFI tooling. Obviously, this ceremony is going to announce the top 15 teams and the finalists, basically. So, Karthik, over to you. Let's start with the finalists.
00:11:39.314 - 00:11:57.514, Speaker A: Let's get started. All right, so the moment all of you have been waiting for. So we have 15 finalists. We're going to announce who they are and then they're going to come on one by one and demo what they built for all of you to see. And without further ado, here are our 15 teams. I'll kind of kick us off. And in no particular order, congratulations to NFT.
00:11:57.514 - 00:12:02.530, Speaker A: To Apple Wallet. Allocate GM space. Two Sq and the Oyster.
00:12:03.350 - 00:12:21.350, Speaker B: And then we have bounty. Hashcan, crypto Wordle ollie share scribe zero, X, corgis PolySign apes to, Punks, Beep XYZ and AR NFT explorer Amazing work, guys.
00:12:21.500 - 00:13:14.002, Speaker A: So these are our 15 teams. We're going to bring them on soon and have them kind of demo. And when we looked at what some of the common themes were for these 15 projects, but as well as generally for most of the submissions we saw, we saw a crazy amount of kind of overlap and common trend on NFDS and gaming. So there's a lot of that here. We're going to see there's a clear emphasis on consumer apps or just services that are ready for everyday use, but leveraging Web Three technologies, we have a lot of stuff on infrastructure, whether It's analytics or DevTools. And then we also have protocols that are just here as new primitives for us to leverage and use them on a more frequent basis given anywhere from gas to scalability concerns being addressed. So some of these teams, we're going to bring them on, the teams on in some of these grander sort of groups.
00:13:14.002 - 00:13:56.926, Speaker A: And before we kind of jump into our very first demo, I want to quickly take a second to thank all 295 projects that are here who putting so much time, effort and work in honestly learning about what's possible. In Web Three, whether it's using different tools and SDKs and APIs, or just kind of understanding and building something they've been curious about or that project that's been on their list for all this time. Just because you were not one of these 15 teams does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong. We just wanted to highlight some things that were super creative and interesting to all of us. And this is kind of the goal for the finale. But we really encourage all of you to continue working. And I know some of you are already interested in getting more feedback.
00:13:56.926 - 00:14:39.810, Speaker A: So if you want to get more feedback, please send us an email about your project and we'll try to see if we can get some more direct comments from our judges. No promises, but we'll try to make sure that everybody gets the opportunity to make themselves anywhere from more skilled to improve what they've been working on. And we want to make sure that you have the right resources to continue building everything that you are interested in and excited about. So congratulations again. And for those of you who are wondering, what are these other projects and how can I catch up on what they did, you can head over to Showcase Ethglobal.com and you can see every single submission that was submitted as part of Rot to Web Three hackathon. And all the projects are now available on the ETHGlobal Showcase.
00:14:39.810 - 00:15:02.586, Speaker A: So, without further ado, let's get started. So, I want to bring on five of these teams. We'll have GM Space NFT to Apple Wallet, the Oyster Apes to Punks, and AR NFT Explorer. Come on. And we'll just kind of do back to you back live demos. So fingers crossed and let's get ready. So, without further ado, let's welcome GM Space for showcasing what they built.
00:15:02.586 - 00:15:04.620, Speaker A: Whenever you're ready, feel free to get started.
00:15:09.470 - 00:15:34.090, Speaker C: So, hi, everyone. We are the team GM space. And I'm Hazel. So our project is an honorable virtual apartment NFT and social metaverse. We're using Unity and more or less Web Three API to build this whole demo. And so who are we? So, I'm Hazel. I'm now based in Boston doing my degree in MIT.
00:15:34.090 - 00:16:14.386, Speaker C: And on our team, we still have like, Addison, Quinn and Catherine based all around the world. Basically, the background of why we built this product is to put everything in a short sentence. It's like we believe in web two. World people say, like, come visit my profile page, like my photos and post. But in web3 things will be very much different. We believe that things will be come visit my NFT apartment and hang out in social metaverse like my NFTs and my room design. So the background is we believe that web3 is an ownership based value internet.
00:16:14.386 - 00:17:23.882, Speaker C: It's all about digital ownership instead of only news or photo feeds in web two. So that's why virtual apartment NFD in web3 will be equals to the profile page in web two. We are building this GM space which basically is a virtual apartment based social metaverse we call the GM space because we imagine people come and say GM to each other every day here. So now we can move to the demo. We have built it in the past week and hopefully things works well today. So we can see that in the demo we can join the game with their different names and then you can see like all my teammates are actually hanging out in this room and we can move around the objects here and there easily. For example we can move this balloon here and there to try to make it add a good design and then we can add for example add this Christmas tree here and we can delete that easily and we can add it back.
00:17:23.882 - 00:18:45.304, Speaker C: So it will be easily for us to build a house, build an apartment, build an office or build a club that people can hang out. So people will have different preference on how they want to build their house. And what's more we can try to connect with wallet here. And once we connect the wallet here, we will be able to see the NFT in our wallet showing up as an object here. So we can pull the NFT on the wall trying to show off our different NFTs and our taste. And after building up the whole room as a house or as a club, as a restaurant or even as the office, we can invite different friends coming in so we can interact with different people. Right now we are still building out the voice chat channel but we assume that with the BITWORK we will be able to talk to each other and voice and video chat with each other when we are in the same space.
00:18:45.304 - 00:19:38.088, Speaker C: And if we go to the left hand side we can see that there are a lot of other buildings outside. This is our mid to long term plan. We would like to build up a whole community instead of just one single apartment. We want to build different malls, different office, different commercial space and different residential space and build it as the whole downtown place for people to hang out and social in the metaverse. So if we go back to the slides we can see that in midterm plan we decide to launch around ten K virtual apartment NFTs. We currently plan to launch these NFPs as the key of the apartment instead of the apartment itself. So people will have the key to enter the space and then they will be able to design the space as whatever they want.
00:19:38.088 - 00:20:21.530, Speaker C: And we'll try to smooth the multiplayer voice chat experience and now we are doing the NFT importing experience and we will try to connect it with different wallets, with different NFTs on different platforms. And we'll also try to strategy partnership with other projects and even other brands so that you can come in to the mall and shop Gucci or shop whatever brands that you want in a virtual space. And the long term plan, as I mentioned, we want to build not only an apartment but also a city. So we'll build in some other public spaces like clubs, office, malls and we want to come up with the whole community driven, vibrant downtown where everyone can build his or her own space.
00:20:23.900 - 00:20:24.360, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:24.430 - 00:20:26.970, Speaker C: So thank you. This is our project.
00:20:28.060 - 00:20:37.470, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much Hazel, for going first and making that amazing game. I hope you continue building this thing and we all get to play and be in this community.
00:20:38.320 - 00:20:40.670, Speaker C: Yeah, super excited about it.
00:20:41.060 - 00:21:12.120, Speaker A: Great. Awesome. So with that, we are ready for our next demo. So without further ado, let's welcome NFT to Apple Wallet. Feel free to present whenever you're ready guys. My name is Jarek. And together with Arthur, we created an NFT to apple wallet.
00:21:12.120 - 00:22:03.980, Speaker A: Artur is a staff engineer, he worked at Facebook and Spotify. And I am a YC alumni and I did design and front end for this project. So we wanted to solve the problem where NFT communities are getting better and better tools to meet and work online. They already have token gated content platforms, calendars and Discords. But there is very little innovation in the offline side of the NFT community building. So we would like to allow NFT creators to build offline presence by enabling their NFTs to be visible in Apple and Google Wallets. Apple and Google Wallets instantly enrich NFTs with geofencing, NFC and QR code connectivity and push notifications.
00:22:03.980 - 00:23:06.720, Speaker A: So our target audiences are for example, brands that are trying to build online offline communities using NFTs like Nike, Adidas or Budweiser. Also existing NFT collection brands that are trying to add utility for their community members, like BYC. So we built three components. First one is NFT listing site that user can log in with MetaMask, on desktop, on mobile to see their NFTs. The second component is Apple Pass Minting service with image manipulation elements so you can actually create an Apple Pass. And the third component is Pass validation service so you can validate whether the Pass that's in the wallet actually matches the ownership of the NFT that sits in the blockchain. So we built this with next JS tailwind morales polygon apple Pasket IMAGEMAGIC QR code APIs and MetaMask.
00:23:06.720 - 00:23:46.236, Speaker A: So I want to show you the live demo right now. So bear with me. Okay, so this is the website. I'm going to log in with my MetaMask wallet and confirm this is my address. So this is the list of my NFTs that I have connected to my address. Right now, as you can see, two of them are my son's artwork, and I'm going to send one of them to my phone. So I'm going to type in my email address and I'm going to send this one.
00:23:46.236 - 00:24:22.854, Speaker A: So right now what happens is I'm going to sign a message so we will be sure that the owner of the NFT is actually creating the Apple Pass. And the Apple Pass is being minted and sent to my phone. So right now I'm going to show you my phone. Okay, so you should see my screen. And now you see okay, I already get the email with the pass. So it's in my email. I can open it.
00:24:22.854 - 00:25:01.570, Speaker A: And as you can see, this is the NFT that I added. So add this to the Apple Wallet. So I can quickly access this Apple Wallet Pass by tapping twice Power button on my iPhone. As you can see, this is my Pass. But also I have other things like you can have multiple different, including the ones that are being operated with NFC connectivity. So in order for me to check this, I need to send this to my computer so I can scan the QR code with my phone. I want to do this on one device.
00:25:01.570 - 00:25:30.778, Speaker A: So I'm going to send this to my laptop right now. It's going to be here in a moment. Yeah, it's downloaded. Yeah, it's done. Okay, let's open it and open my camera up. Okay, so this is the QR code. Let me scan the QR code and yeah, there we are.
00:25:30.778 - 00:26:05.650, Speaker A: So my Apple Pass was verified, I'm the owner. All went smoothly. So as you can see, this Apple Wallet functionality can be used for different things. One of the things that we would like to explore further is prepaid NFT based gift cards. This could be really interesting way to pay with your phone. Thank you very much. Thank you to Eastbobble and congratulations to all the teams.
00:26:05.650 - 00:26:23.898, Speaker A: Thank you. Amazing. Thank you so much, Eric. This is such an awesome demo. I can't wait for this to become the go to standard for us interacting with everything in NFTs and our phones. This is great. Next up, we have the oyster, and we'll get that demo started as soon as the team's ready.
00:26:23.898 - 00:26:24.620, Speaker A: Welcome.
00:26:26.770 - 00:26:58.082, Speaker D: Hello, everyone. My name is 16. I'm a designer based in Paris, working with Lawrence with a US based full stack developer. Let me tell you about the oyster, but note that for clarity I'm going to talk about the creators of design objects. There are designers who have a multiform practice, sometimes at the edge of arts when they are famous. You can find their work in museums or on sale at sotebis for example, there is a problem with the design market. Design work is expensive.
00:26:58.082 - 00:27:47.430, Speaker D: To create a chef, for example, you will need to have access to raw materials to create prototypes. Galleries and publishers give designers resources to create, but they also often influence their creation and it's not uncommon for them to take more than 50% of the surprise. Designers don't always understand the value of NFTs or how to integrate it into their practice without compromising their work. Designers are also afraid to devalue their work by exposing it between a monkey or generated pixel art characters. On the design lover side, they are often passionate about the design studio they love. But with all the intermediaries that exist, they can't really show their passion. So they follow their favorite designer on Instagram and they create beautiful pinterest bots.
00:27:47.430 - 00:28:32.766, Speaker D: They usually buy in traditional online stores that have poor UX experience. When they understand NFTs and are not into crypto art, they can't really find anywhere to buy created designs. And when they don't understand NFTs, well Gpegs, this is why we think there is a space for market innovation in design and that's why we created the Oyster. The Oyster is a marketplace where you can buy designs just like you used to do and collect NFTs. Or let me put it another way, you can collect NFTs and receive designs at home for your collection. As a buyer or a designer, you don't even have to care for NFTs or to understand it. As a buyer.
00:28:32.766 - 00:29:04.298, Speaker D: You can just buy like you used to do, claim your NFTs. If you want your reward, collect them or sell them on secondary marketplaces. As a designer you can make more value from selling your work from the traditional sell and from the royalties from the sale of your NFTs. Those NFTs can be sketches, drawings, photography, 3D models. This is all part of the design process, so no extra work is needed. But let me show you how it works. All you need to do is to run the Oyster.
00:29:04.298 - 00:29:44.534, Speaker D: You will find both unique and series from designer. Once you find that chair that you were looking for, you can discover piece of the work behind it. For example, this is a sketch that is part of the design process of the creation of the chair. You can buy it by crypto or using Fiat. This is important because we really want to onboard newbies. Once this is done, all you have to do is to fill your profile information to receive your purchase at your home and then you will have ten days to collect your reward. During the hackathon we managed to build a demo app of the Oyster.
00:29:44.534 - 00:30:28.074, Speaker D: We used both Morales and NFT ports to mint and deploy our NFTs on the polygon blockchain. Let me go back to the reward. So the reward is an artwork itself for the design lover and collectors. By purchasing a design object, you also get a piece of the behind the scene work of the designer. For the designer, it's also a way to evaluate their design process. In the future, buyers could even prepay a design from a sketch and it will help the designer to raise funds to produce their net design project. The next step regarding our project is to have a functionable MVP with Crypto and Fiat payments with wallets login and traditional login option.
00:30:28.074 - 00:31:05.190, Speaker D: But by now, the goal is to onboard as many people as possible. And in the meantime, we will be working on a tokenomics that makes sense. The Oyster makes the process of buying designs and NFTs frictionless for newbies by providing collectibles to design lovers and helping designers to get revenue from their work. By evaluating the creation process, the Oyster onboard people in web Three True Culture because we strongly believe that technology isn't driving mass adoption, but culture is. If you would like to be notified of our launch or to contribute, visit theoyster XYZ. Thank you very much for your attention.
00:31:06.810 - 00:31:46.252, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you so much for that awesome demo. And this is such a cool yeah, just get everybody into design and also have a way to connect physical with digital. So this is amazing. Next up we have SAR from apes to punks. So SAR, whenever you're ready, feel free to get started with your demo. Everyone, my name SAR and today I present to you Apes to Punks.
00:31:46.252 - 00:32:25.244, Speaker A: Lately, I've been experimenting with onchain generated NFTs and more precisely experimenting with dynamic on chain generated evolutional NFTs. Today I'm happy to present to you apes. To Punks. Apes to Punks are dynamic onchain generated evolutional NFTs. The apes are living on the blockchain and evolving as time passes. So why is it cool? The NFTs are 100% generated on chain, meaning there is no offchain data that can get corrupted or get lost. The minting price bonding curve is a monotonic increasing function.
00:32:25.244 - 00:32:59.050, Speaker A: And with every Mint call on the Smart contract, the minting price is increasing by 10%. The NFTs are evolving over time from apes to punks. The back end and smart contracts are using Solidity, RDAP, SVG and Morales. And the front end is built with react JS node JS and iterjs it is now live on the Polygon network. And you can access this website and mint your own Apes Two Punks. Let's see a demo. So you can enter this website.
00:32:59.050 - 00:34:05.940, Speaker A: You see this button here? You can press mint. Let's put it on. I press confirm. You awesome. So as you can see, the minting price increased by 10%, the amount increased by one. And now we can go to Openc. Let's give it a second.
00:34:05.940 - 00:35:30.658, Speaker A: Usually it takes time for Openc to refresh the metadata and It. And there is our Apes to Punks number nine that just been Minted. And because I don't want all of you to wait two and a half years to see the whole evolution from apes to punks. I will give you a sneak peek right now to what is going to happen in the next two and a half years. So once I minted this NFT a snapshot is taken and gradually but truly the ape will evolve slowly but surely into a punk. So thank you everyone. We are now live on the Polygon network and you can go ahead and meet your own ape to Punks.
00:35:30.658 - 00:35:58.086, Speaker A: Thank you. Awesome. Thanks SAR. This is such a cool concept because not only is this fully generative as well as on chain but you did a live demo on Mainnet and nothing went wrong so that's great. Yeah. All right, well feel free to try out and mincing some of these apes debunks on the Main net live and thanks so much. And next up, we have Jasper.
00:35:58.086 - 00:36:35.790, Speaker A: And Jasper is going to demo AR NFT Explorer. So Jasper whenever you're ready let's get the demo started. And as Jasper comes in this is one of the demos that requires a little bit of setup. So we'll give a few more seconds here and get everybody ready. I think the audio on my device is not working at the moment so when I walk I'll just talk really loud so everybody brace yourself. Sounds perfect. Perfect.
00:36:35.790 - 00:37:31.038, Speaker A: So hello everybody. I developed a little app called the AR NFT Explorer and finding interesting NFTs can really be quite difficult but also it's really boring. So I wanted to just make things a little more interesting, spice things up and develop a little AR demo on viewing and exploring the web of interesting NFDS. So I'm going to just stand up here and how this app works is first you can select a network. So right now either Polygon or Mainnet let's just stick to Polygon and you can enter in an address that's either a smart contract or a user's profile. And once you pick an address you can hit Explore NFTs and you'll enter the world of AR. So here we have the baby ape Polygon and we can see that it loads in some NFTs from the baby ape Polygon contract and we can explore them here.
00:37:31.038 - 00:38:13.126, Speaker A: For any of these we can just click and do them in openc. But where the real power of this app comes in is we can actually look at an NFT that we find interesting. Like let's say this ape looks a bit interesting to us and if we click it it will actually bring in other NFTs. Since we're looking at a collection here it'll bring in user NFTs from this user's collection. So if you lose my audio just let me know, I'll try to yell. So as we go and as we continue exploring now we can see some NFTs from this user's collection. So they have stuff like the Polyfunks gang, they have some from Not Monkey Kingdom, they even have some Crypto mythics.
00:38:13.126 - 00:38:42.642, Speaker A: And if we see NFTs that we are interested. In. Like, let's take a look at this crypto dolphins. We can click and it should populate once it queries the metadata from the contract. In this case, we can see more of the crypto dolphins, so we can keep following this chain and exploring and seeing interesting NFDS and creating this web of AR content. So I'm just going to pull in some new ones here. Some users, they have very few NFTs, so we don't get much.
00:38:42.642 - 00:39:14.686, Speaker A: But slowly and surely, we're building this web of NFTs that we can explore in AR. So what's fun about this app is you can use it as just a simple viewer for your NFTs, or you can also find NFTs that you might not have known about before. This is using WebXR. We're using Aframe and three JS for the rendering. And what's cool about this technology is it's just via the Web. You don't have to download any app, but that also means that it's quite experimental. So not fully featured yet.
00:39:14.686 - 00:39:41.366, Speaker A: But WebXR technology really interesting, something that I just started last weekend, but I think has a lot of potential for interesting applications in the future. I just want to thank the East Global team for everything you do and thanks all the judges and sponsors. It's been a great hackathon and, yeah, it's a wonderful time. Thank you all. Thank you so much for that. Jasper. Yeah, I think the thing that blew my mind, first of all, we heard everything really well.
00:39:41.366 - 00:40:00.510, Speaker A: No audio issues. The demo worked really nice, no lags. And the thing that blew my mind was I did not realize this was Webexr until you talked about it. And yeah, for everybody, a couple of people asked, how did they try it? You just go to URL and it works. And this is definitely going to be incredible as it rolls out and becomes more stable. Cheers. Amazing.
00:40:00.510 - 00:40:20.670, Speaker A: Cool. Well, thank you so much. And for people who are interested, you can head over to Showcase.com and find Jasper's project and try out the live demo. Great. So that concludes our first five demos. And they covered mostly what's happening with NFTs and metaverse and gaming.
00:40:20.670 - 00:40:50.366, Speaker A: So next up, we're going to bring another class of projects here and we're going to go into these five demos. So we're going to have Crypto, ordle Bounty, two Sq, two X, Corgis, and PolySign. Come on. And demo. And without further ado, let's get started with the next category and our first demo, which is Team Crypto World. So whenever you're ready, feel free to get started. Hello.
00:40:50.468 - 00:40:51.120, Speaker E: Hello.
00:40:53.970 - 00:40:54.880, Speaker A: All right.
00:40:58.230 - 00:41:24.550, Speaker E: Hi. We are Crypto World. My name is Marcels, and here with me is Albert. We are currently located in Riga, Latvia. It's a small, beautiful country near the Baltic Sea. We have delicious food and fast Internet, so you should definitely come visit us once. During this hackathon.
00:41:24.550 - 00:42:03.910, Speaker E: We have created a puzzle game powered by Blockchain. This week was the most fun in the last few years. So thank you really much for this great opportunity. We started in what we believe in. We appreciate the possibilities that cryptocurrencies give to society. So we wanted to jump into web3 space and this is our first crypto related project. We believe that using cryptocurrencies for simple casual purposes is the key for technological development of the whole ecosystem.
00:42:03.910 - 00:42:55.800, Speaker E: We are very focused on usability and looking for ways to improve user crypto experience. We think that we just discovered a way how many people will buy some crypto tokens to use? So what exactly are we doing here? The game of Vertle powered by Blockchain have you heard of Wordle? It became very popular recently and people loved sharing their successful guesses. In this game you have to guess some unknown word. You don't know anything about square except the number of letters. If you guess the letter correctly, the squared with the letter becomes green. If the letter is correct but in the wrong position, the square becomes yellow. What we came up with is slightly different.
00:42:55.800 - 00:43:38.050, Speaker E: We just brought Wordle to the next level crypto level. To start playing, you have to log in with your crypto wallet and insert one polygon matic coin. There is a word of six letters that you have to guess, but the amount of attendance you can make is limited. When you guess the word correctly, you can create your own word and share it with people. If they lose, you get their coin. That's really good. But if another person loses with the same word again, you get his coin.
00:43:38.050 - 00:44:22.450, Speaker E: Basically from this moment you already can't lose. You can win many coins and you only stop winning when someone guesses your word correctly. Okay, let me tell a few words about our team. We are a team of two people and I'm responsible for playing Fortnite. I'm a senior fortnite expert. My partner is a hacker with 20 years experience in it. He used to be a development manager but has quit because he couldn't live without hacking.
00:44:22.450 - 00:45:07.706, Speaker E: He is actually thinking about joining some cool crypto startup in the nearest future. So don't miss the opportunity, especially if you also are in love with Net and Blazor. Okay, how did we make it? The technologies we used are net and Blazor WebAssembly. We deployed smart contracts with polygon network. Of course, the smart contracts were written with Solidity and deployed with Remix to connect polygon blockchain from C sharp code. This project uses Netherium open source library. This guy is insane.
00:45:07.706 - 00:45:54.670, Speaker E: He didn't sleep last night again but was coding whole time to make it perfect. Some bugs are still present. For example, at this very moment you can't automatically get back your winnings. But still we came from total zero to a working app. We have many plans for the nearest weeks or maybe the months. Like leaderboard with the most winnings some voting where users can vote for the next feature, they want introduction about how to easily get coins. We also wanted to make it completely decentralized, also integrate other wallets, for example.
00:45:54.670 - 00:46:24.630, Speaker E: We are definitely going to use sequence wallet. We already wanted to have it, but we were short of time and there were many things to do. We're also planning to do some growth hacking. The game is catchy and totally playable. You will soon hear about it. So you definitely should try and share to let more people participate. Let's make this viral and let's bring cryptocurrencies to masses.
00:46:24.630 - 00:46:38.320, Speaker E: This is it. Now, I only want to say thank you very much for an outstanding event. It was a lot of fun to do hacking together. I hope to see you in Amsterdam soon.
00:46:41.570 - 00:47:04.970, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, Marshallson Albert, thank you so much for that amazing demo. We're already getting comments from everybody that they loved this little slide demo and everything you said. So this is a perfect example of just a fun hackathon project that is just super cool and fun to interact with. So this is great and I hope you actually get this in the hands of other people to try this out. Congrats.
00:47:05.150 - 00:47:05.734, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:47:05.772 - 00:47:30.334, Speaker A: Thank you very much. We really enjoyed that. We're glad that you were part of the event and you got to do this fun thing. And thanks for demoing. So with that, we are ready for our next demo, and that is Bounty. So, Bo Yang, whenever you're ready, feel free to get was a that was a very cute demo, guys. All right.
00:47:30.334 - 00:47:56.774, Speaker A: We are bounty. So it's me and David, and we're based in San Francisco. So what Bounty is is a inverse kickstarter. Normally a creator would pitch an idea and you get to fund it, but in this case, we want fans to pitch the idea. You can fund it as a shared treasury. You can vote on whether the creator is fulfilling milestones and all of the treasury and the funds are handled by a smart contract. So we're going to role play this a little bit.
00:47:56.774 - 00:48:05.734, Speaker A: I'm going to be a fan. David is going to speak on the part of the author, George R. R. Martin. And here we go. Yeah. Wow.
00:48:05.734 - 00:48:20.746, Speaker A: I can't believe George RR. Martin's on this on this platform. That's pretty crazy. I really want him to do something for me. So I have a lot of options here. I can change whatever price that I want to give him. I can change his delivery date, his payout structure.
00:48:20.746 - 00:48:45.560, Speaker A: But I think I just saw something that I really wanted to already get done, which is to remake Game of Thrones season eight because I think it sucked. And so someone else has already made this. I'm actually just going to contribute to it. And in this case, I'm going to give 0.1 Maddox to the treasury. And what that's going to do is add it to the shared balance and then if we go over here to George R. Martin's view.
00:48:45.560 - 00:49:11.230, Speaker A: Oh, boy. Another day, another bounty for Game of Thrones, eh? Oh, I don't know. It looks like well, in this case it's zero, but it should be 0.1 matic, but so little. I think I will only do it for 0.2. And you know what, I'm actually just going to remake the ending. So that's too long, too much for the entire season.
00:49:11.230 - 00:49:42.790, Speaker A: All right. So when we come over here and this transaction is going to take a little bit, that we'll see that the Bouncy has been funded with what I put in. And when it goes into this negotiating status, we'll see that George R. Martin, he's interested and he has these terms for me. So what I can do right now is I can either get my money back or I can rejoin. But I actually do want season eight to happen. So I'm going to rejoin and in addition, I'm going to add an extra 0.1.
00:49:42.790 - 00:50:22.690, Speaker A: So that's going to hit this guy's reserve price. And what that means is George R. Martin, now he's committed. Like he's going to have to do this. He's on the hook for giving me what I want and we'll see what that looks like on his end. Well, it'll take a little oh, it looks like they accepted it or this submission has gone through. So I need to create a new revision, you know, to start, I think I never really liked the original casting for Jon Snow and I want to see if I can recast him for this first update.
00:50:22.690 - 00:50:43.146, Speaker A: Let's see what the fans think of that and whether or not they'll give me my next bonus. Know, I thought Jon Snow was fine the way that he was. I thought kid Harrington was fine. I'm going to take my money back. I'm going to vote no on this. I'm taking that bonus target back and it's going right in my wallet. I think George R.
00:50:43.146 - 00:51:30.490, Speaker A: Martin is really phoning this one in and he needs to try harder. So we're here, I'm refreshed, we'll wait for it to go through. Polygon test network is a little bit slow today, so we'll see. Yeah, basically the steps are submitting revisions and we'll see what happens here. And it looks like I got to try for bonus target two this time and here instead I need to work a little harder. So I'll replace both of them, both Daenerys and John, and hopefully this will get convinced them this time know, I really hated that first picture. This one looks completely different.
00:51:30.490 - 00:52:13.766, Speaker A: I'm not really sure what it is about this piece of art that is making me vote yes, but I really like it. And George R. Martin, he's going to take my money right now. And so when we switch this over and this finishes, we'll actually see well, actually we can, we can check Georgia R. Martin's balance right at this moment we'll see know he got some money, he's going to be getting some more in the form of bonuses once this goes through. And once it goes through, actually what happens is that we'll mint an NFT at the end of this, and we'll show you what that looks, you know, minting the NFT. George R.
00:52:13.766 - 00:52:46.450, Speaker A: R. Martin does this, but everyone who was involved in the bounty will get ownership of the final NFT. The NFT gets assigned to the bounty contract itself, and we will show you what that looks like here. So eventually, this is on Testnet. You can see here's what we've minted. And inside of the description, there's a metadata thing and also the addresses and who owns what. And the idea is that you'd be able to do this for Digital art, commission your artists and get some portion of their NFTs.
00:52:46.450 - 00:53:02.760, Speaker A: The idea, we're going to keep working on it in the next week. Feel free to please join our discord. We have a little link here. We're at bountyproteocol XYZ. And yeah, if you want to reach out to us, we're on Twitter too. So thank you for the hackathons. It's great.
00:53:02.760 - 00:53:25.950, Speaker A: David Boyang, thank you so much for that. Awesome. Can I agree with all the comments we're getting anyway, which is the proposed revisions are way better than the original. So I hope this gets accepted next remake. So congrats. And with that, we are ready for our next demo. So without further ado, I'd like to welcome Nishant to talk about Two Sq.
00:53:25.950 - 00:54:08.946, Speaker A: Thank you, Karthik. So my name is Nishant, and my project was Two Sq. You can find it at Two Sq XYZ. So the problem that I'm trying to solve is that the current NFT community space is a little bit fragmented. Few communities are on Twitter, few of them are on Discord. And if you want to know what's going on, you probably have to join their discord, verify yourself and see what the people are saying. Once you do that, you still don't know if the people that are talking in these communities, like on Twitter and Discord actually own the NFT and say, you want to join a new NFT project tomorrow, you have to join that discord.
00:54:08.946 - 00:54:58.954, Speaker A: And then you have to join a bunch of communities and makes it a lot harder. So I wanted to bring everything to one place, on one platform where different NFT communities can interact with each other. So I think all of us saw Apes to Punk demo a few minutes ago, so let's go to their page. So now we're at Apes to Punk page, and you can see all the screen sharing is not enabled. Sorry. Yeah. Okay, so we're at Apesapunk's page right now, and you can see that all of the NFT metadata, like the name, the picture, even the address, and you can also see that we automatically detect if this address was a polygon address or an ethereum address.
00:54:58.954 - 00:55:41.024, Speaker A: So now we see that you can only mint or you can only post on this page if you own an NFT from Apes to Punk. So let's connect my wallet. Okay, now I'm logged in so it's going to verify my ownership and you can see that now I have an option to post. So I'm going to say, hey, how is everyone? And this supports Markdown as well so I can make it header, put a background and so on. I also found this nice meme. So I'm going to share this with everyone so you can see it's waiting for a few seconds. And my post is live.
00:55:41.024 - 00:56:20.888, Speaker A: It even shows the NFT that I own within the community and other posts as well. Right, so let's go back to the homepage and let's go to the Little Lemon Friends page. Right? I don't own an NFT from this collection, so once it verifies my address, you can see that it doesn't allow me to post. So that creates that sort of FOMO within communities where if I want to post on the Little Lemons page, I have to mint an NFT or have to buy an NFT from that collection. Right? And you can also notice that it shows ether scan on that page. So let's come back to the home page again and let's go to the personal section. So this is where you can see all your NFT collections.
00:56:20.888 - 00:56:45.934, Speaker A: So right now I'm just going to click on this one and there you go. I'm on the Build space NFT collection and you can also see posts that's going on around the space. So if you're part of a community, you can invite everyone and have a great time here. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you for that demo. This is cool.
00:56:45.934 - 00:57:18.466, Speaker A: And not only did you just make a main net demo, but this also uses a project that just demoed 30 minutes ago, apes to Punks. And we're already in the composability phase of using all these things. So for anybody who just minted an Ape to Punk from Mainnet, you can go to Two Sq XYZ and say hi. So thanks again Nishant. And with that we are ready for our next demo and I want to welcome Andrew to talk about Zero X Corgis. Hello. So we are zero x corgis.
00:57:18.466 - 00:58:07.654, Speaker A: So let me share my screen. So pretty much Ox corgis we are making web3 docs into cute in a form of minigames. So the problem is everyone has documentation. Can we make it a little bit 1% better or a little bit different with little types of puzzle games minigames? Some of the pain points we see throughout the hackathon is just reading docs and then try to get started. So our solution is to build, learn, earn, or explore or play. And we're trying to convert web Three docs into fun informative games in itself. So we'll see that kind of like our analogy would be it's like a Du lingo which is like a learning language app plus clippy which is kind of like a Microsoft assistant that will help you guide you through onboarding process as well.
00:58:07.654 - 00:58:54.626, Speaker A: So here's kind of like a screenshot of our Chrome extension having pretty much your friend Cody. And that assistant will help you through the documentation and it only will show in different types of docs across the board. So the technology is built with metamass polygon IPFS react hard hat and the contract was built in solidity deployed on testnet. So I'm going to do a quick demo. So right here when you go to the app, you can see that this is the main page. So the goal is to defeat Imposter Syndrome and explore the web3 space. So I'm going to hit press Start and you can see there are little different types of levels.
00:58:54.626 - 00:59:50.854, Speaker A: We have eGlobal polygon. So why not? I just try eGlobal. I want to learn more, I want to hit about ETH global and I will connect my wallet. Once it's connected, you put in some polygon to play and that will send a transaction. So let me double check pending and then you can play some of these minigames in itself. So let's say what is eat global So if I say Eat Global and try to get it wrong, it will turn the borders red. But let's say helps onboard developers and designers to web3 check.
00:59:50.854 - 01:00:25.938, Speaker A: And then the process is that you can earn like an entity or mint it in itself. Now let's move on to the Chrome extension where you could actually it becomes like more of an onboarding platform. So if I do polygon, you would see here that you have your assistant and it will pop up. You can say like maybe you want to turn it on and off so you have that option as well. And what's cool is that you want to learn more about that documentation and it'll guide you through. So it gives you some of these paths of polygon. So let's say if you want to onboard yourself to web3.
01:00:25.938 - 01:01:00.910, Speaker A: So I'm going to say hello MetaMask. It goes through and highlights it with gradients of the steps. So if I want to do step one, click downloads and some of the sets will pop up so it will be as well. So like step two and it'll show you how to get installed and get ready. And then others will be like if you want to add to polygon, it can get more complex and the games will be more like scavenger hunts. But sometimes reading documentation, I can go through this or I can ask for help and with that I can actually see that it will give you hints. So if I want to scroll bottom it will show me those gradients.
01:01:00.910 - 01:01:34.966, Speaker A: Or if you want to just play the minigames you can. So you can say like what is about polygon. I can connect and still put in some polygon as funds and then they'll show you some of these minigames or puzzles. So let's say this is it. I got this wrong. Or I can click and get it right and then I earn these badges. So then the next steps for this project would be maybe skins NFT badges that will change the character or the Chrome, your partner.
01:01:34.966 - 01:02:13.494, Speaker A: And also we can try to create more different types of mascots. It doesn't have to be corgis. A lot of times we can make new characters for each of the different Web three orgs and then try to make it and build it up like more like crypto zombies or Ethernotes that will teach you solidity Rust, python and JavaScript languages for web3. So it can be expansive with different characters and different lots of explorations. Or build your identity with that Chrome extension. And if you want to learn more thank you for the event. We'll pretty much be deploying it to Mainnet and the Chrome extension will be published in the future.
01:02:13.494 - 01:02:51.358, Speaker A: You can follow us pretty much Ox corgis or just chat on Nmtvtuber. Awesome. Thank you so much for that demo, Andrew. I think this is just we're seeing so much education focused kind of content coming on just in web Three. And I think the thing that kind of delighted me was that the Chrome extension piece that you get to point people to go here and follow these next steps and just sort of do all these things just makes it so interesting to kind of onward way more people. Everyone has docs. Not everybody has to read the docs.
01:02:51.358 - 01:03:20.714, Speaker A: But interactivity is kind of the key here, especially for people who are either trying to become developers or understand the nuances. So this is great. I hope you continue blending this thing and I hope that we all get to use it. I think we can already use it, but we all use it for more protocols and projects and categories. Thank you. So event congrats. All right, so next up we have PolySign and we're just getting a confirmation on some technical issues here.
01:03:20.714 - 01:03:56.358, Speaker A: So we'll give this a 32nd kind of wait. And if we don't get those resolved, then we'll move on to the next team. But I'm hopeful here. We haven't had too many things go wrong, so we'll figure this out in a few seconds. And in the meantime, for anybody, I'm already seeing a few questions on the chat. So if you have any questions about sort of what's happening, whether it's for the wrap up or any kind of follow up questions that you had about the event, please just kind of type them out here and I'll be able to answer those questions for everybody. And just a quick note on how the prizes are going to go.
01:03:56.358 - 01:04:53.126, Speaker A: That's the most common question we have gotten. So don't worry, we have six more demos to go, and after that, we'll be solely focused on covering all the prizes. And you'll kind of see who won everything what and everything that you need to know about how do you receive the prizes, how do you claim them, what the timelines are. And if something didn't go according to expectations, like what to do there in terms of any dispute resolutions or the ability to kind of go and get another response from anybody, So that's kind of the context. We are on track here, and let's see what's going on. So I'll wait a few more seconds here and just get a quick confirmation from our next team. All right, so let's just get started with our next project, which is allocate.
01:04:53.126 - 01:05:16.210, Speaker A: So we already have Jason Alfonso here, and we'll also get Nathan on the zoom. So whenever you're ready, Allocate team, feel free to kick off with your demo. Welcome. Thank you very much. So, hello, everybody. My name is Jason and I'm with the allocate team. We are a team of four developers.
01:05:16.210 - 01:06:04.610, Speaker A: And the problem that we're trying to solve is how do you teach your children to use crypto safely and confidently? And our solution is by teaching them DeFi and investing allowances in a safe environment managed by parents. So I'll give you a quick demo. So upon landing on our page, you'll notice you have a couple of different ways of logging in. And onboarding, you can utilize web3 Auth, or you can sign in with sequence. So upon landing or signing in as a parent, you're going to be welcomed on your own Dashboard. This Dashboard has been pre populated already with some Usdcx that is a superfluid super token that we use to stream funds and allowances to the children. You have the ability to top up your account and to withdraw funds.
01:06:04.610 - 01:06:55.920, Speaker A: And you want to add your children as simply as putting in either their username or their actual name, whatever you prefer, providing their web address or sorry, their wallet address and setting whether or not they're allowed to withdraw funds. And we'll get to that a little later. Once you've added your children, you can add funds to them or send funds to them individually. You can create a stream and send funds to them over time. And if you have more than one child, you can send funds to them at the same time. Using the Superfluid Instant Distribution agreement, you're able to see at a glance the activity of your child's investments, how they're handling their funds, and then you're able to send more funds to them. So this is a quick rundown of what it looks like from the perspective of a parent.
01:06:55.920 - 01:07:36.138, Speaker A: If we were to go over to the child Dashboard again, a child can log in with their social media, google, Twitter, Twitch, and we can see already that there are funds streaming into the child's account in real time. They have the ability to top up their account. And right now, we have an allocation. So the child has already allocated some funds. So when you allocate funds, what you're doing is you're setting a goal for the future. In this case, Peter set a goal that he wants an Xbox, and you can add additional allocations to an existing allocation. So right here, if we added, say, 15 Usdcx, you're going to be able to earn rewards on these allocations and on these goals.
01:07:36.138 - 01:08:15.206, Speaker A: So if your account is a full access account from the parent, you can earn additional rewards. You can actually earn interest on this Usdcx. If it's a locked account, then you'll only be able to earn the allocate tokens. So if we add our funds, you can see at a glance that we have 32 available funds left of Peters that he's able to manage. He's got 27 funds totally invested, and at the moment, he's got 18 allocate tokens. And these tokens will be able to be used in the future throughout our platform. And now, when it comes to withdrawing funds, let's say that Peter's all done, he's all done managing and he wants to withdraw his funds.
01:08:15.206 - 01:09:09.622, Speaker A: A key component to our platform is that if the parent set up those permissions that we talked about and gave full access, then when you go to transfer your funds, that those funds are going to go to your externally owned wallet and you'll be able to use those funds across any crypto market. But if your funds are locked, not your funds, but your account, sorry, the permissions are set and it's in a locked state, it means that you're working inside a sandbox. And when trying to do a transfer, what's going to happen is that those funds are going to be diverted back to the parent and the parent will be able to pay out the child in fiat. So that's a quick rundown of our application. We have our sponsor integration, where we use polygon to reduce our gas fees. We use Superfluid as they handle the streaming of allowances to children. And we use Sequence and Web Three off as they both allow the children to create a wallet and log in with Web Two social accounts.
01:09:09.622 - 01:09:41.538, Speaker A: We do have a roadmap. After this hackathon, we're hoping to upgrade our staking rewards, introduce education portals and be production ready. Stage three would consist of introducing an NFT marketplace and community incentives, and phase four, where we want to introduce liquidity and sandbox pools. We are live on the polygon network, so check us out. Thank you very much. Amazing. Thank you so much for that awesome demo, and it's so glad to see tools and things being built for younger generation and just being ready for 21st century.
01:09:41.538 - 01:09:57.606, Speaker A: So this is great. I hope this goes live for everybody to use and check it out. And congrats again for demoing live. Thank you very much. All right, so this. Brings us to our last five teams that are going to come on and demo. So we're going to bring on PolySign.
01:09:57.606 - 01:10:07.614, Speaker A: Ollie share. Hashcan. Scribe and beep. So without further ado, let's welcome Chris to demo PolySign. Welcome, Chris. All right.
01:10:07.652 - 01:10:54.320, Speaker F: Hey, everybody. Let me just share my screen and we can get going. All right, well, hey, everybody. My name is Chris, and I am a software engineer actually working out of Boston. And I put together an app called PolySign. Now, if any of you have esigned documents or signed documents in the last year, maybe a few months, you might be familiar with an app called DocuSign, which you can use to send e signature requests to virtually anybody. Now the problem with this is that it's highly centralized and DocuSign is technically collecting this fee per month regardless of your usage and regardless of how often you want to use it or how many team members you have.
01:10:54.320 - 01:11:54.890, Speaker F: So I wanted to use Polygon and in particular some of the other sponsors to enable anybody that has a Web Three account to send esignature requests and acknowledgments to other people based on addresses rather than requiring things like emails or other sort of identity. Because blockchain can actually serve in a lot of ways as an identity provider. So this form is actually very simple. So the way this works is anybody can come in with a Web Three wallet or a Polygon account and create an esignature request. I have an example here that's just like a condo agreement, and right now I have it hooked up to MetaMask, but I also have a flag that could be used with sequence. So whatever wallet the end user wants to use doesn't really matter as long as you have the funds and are unable to just pay the gas fees. So what could cost $10 on ethereum just to send any signature requests now can be done for a fraction of that using Matic and Polygon.
01:11:54.890 - 01:12:28.010, Speaker F: So I have an example document, but this is just like assign this PDF. This could be virtually anything, could be a collection of documents. And once I'm good with this request, I can submit it. And there's a couple things that happen behind the scenes. So the first thing is that a Polygon contract gets deployed, and most importantly is this address at the bottom. So this is actually saying, who can actually sign this request? So this request actually gets deployed. And so not everybody you want to be able to sign this particular contract.
01:12:28.010 - 01:13:09.510, Speaker F: So I just entered the same address I used for my existing wallet because I'm going to be the one that signs it for the demo, but that could have been anybody, and we enforce that. Only the address listed there can be the one that signs the agreement. The second step that happens is an upload of the documents attached to the original request. And so, sorry, zoom is in the way a little bit there. But this is, like, facilitated by Morales to host the metadata associated with this request, and now it's forever preserved. All the assets information needed to fill that contract are now available here. So that's just the metadata I provided.
01:13:09.510 - 01:13:42.942, Speaker F: The second link is the polygon contract, and that's actually deployed on Mumbai. And so the information about the contract who can sign it is actually saved forever in the blockchain rather than actually having it hosted on DocuSign. And so really, I'm just paying gas fees rather than paying a centralized party. The last URL is potentially the most important one. And so this is the URL that you would actually share with your colleague. And so I'm already logged in with the same account. So if I weren't logged in with this account, it would say, hey, you're not the authorized party.
01:13:42.942 - 01:14:03.690, Speaker F: You can't sign these documents. So the exact same information is available to your friend that you want to sign this agreement. And so you would just send them this URL, say, hey, I want to sign this. I can actually open that particular document. Let me just move this again. This is just a landlord recommendation letter. This could be anything, and I just want to acknowledge it.
01:14:03.690 - 01:14:39.830, Speaker F: If those look good to me, I just say accept, type my initials, draw my signature, sign it. And so remember, I'm actually the signing party now. And what happens behind the scenes is there's two big things. One, we generate an NFT to represent, hey, I signed it. At this point in time. There's also a contract interaction that happens against that polygon contract to indicate I signed it, and it uploads an image of my signature with it as well. So now we have the signature as well as the documents stored on IPFS to represent that document exchange.
01:14:39.830 - 01:15:21.140, Speaker F: Lastly, you could go back to the site and look up all the activity that happened against the particular address. So if I did a particular deploy, I can simply go back here and see, like, okay, here are all the e signatures I have out here are the ones that I'm collecting. I have some other activity on this address, but in theory, this could just be a list of all the e signature requests you have going out and be able to see the contracts as they evolve. So 34 seconds ago, this was actually the confirmation that went through. So there's an NFT that's saved as well as a contract interaction that marks the esignature request as fulfilled. But that's pretty much the PolySign project today. And thanks for your time.
01:15:22.230 - 01:15:38.390, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much for that demo, Chris. And, yeah, this is such a cool utility that is finally ready for a web two to web3 hotspot replacement with no differences for the end user. So this is great. Cool. Thank you so much. And with that, we are ready for our next demo.
01:15:38.390 - 01:16:03.336, Speaker A: So I want to welcome Hanway to talk about Aldi Share. So whenever you're ready to get started. All right. Thanks, Katik. Hello, everyone. My name is Hanwei. I'm currently located in Singapore, and actually, I'm not exactly a web developer, but I'm actually a video producer, animator, and media writer.
01:16:03.336 - 01:16:59.196, Speaker A: This is my very first webtree hackathon, and I joined this hackathon alone, so I don't have team. And the project on my entry is called Ollie Share. Ollishare is a decentralized application that allows NFT creators to distribute revenues to all their NFT owners. Now, the key idea here is to enable long term NFT projects to reward all their NFT owners as investors. So with this platform, NFP creators can distribute revenues that are generated from royalties, social media monetization, sales for in app purchase, DLC from games, merch sales, and even brand collaborations. So to bring this idea to life, I wrote a contract called Dynamic Payment Splitter. It's called Dynamic because it is very flexible when it comes to the handling of payment splitting, even though there is a change of NFT ownership.
01:16:59.196 - 01:17:43.256, Speaker A: So let me just give you a quick example. So, for example, person A and Person B are the owners of this particular NFT project that gives distributed revenues. So let's say one day the NFT creator decides to distribute some revenues. So both of them will receive revenues because they are the owners of this NFT project. However, let's say sometime later on, person A decides to sell all his NFTs to Person B. Then during the next distribution, person A will not receive anything because he's no longer the owner of that NFT. And on top of that, I also built a website, and I use Morales to interact with the smart contract.
01:17:43.256 - 01:18:28.300, Speaker A: As a result of this integration, both sending and receiving of the distributed funds can be performed by both NFT creators and NFT owners, making this platform a one stop solution for distributed revenues. Without further ado, let me just give you a quick demo on how it works. All right, so this is a website I have built. Here's a landing page. Let me just very quickly log in with my MetaMask. Let me just refresh it again. Looks like I have to log in again.
01:18:28.300 - 01:18:56.064, Speaker A: Okay, find it. Okay, here I am, logged in already. So let me go to this page called Distribute. So for this demo, I'm just going to use one of the projects that I deployed as a demo. This is a project that I deployed to polygon Minnet. It's in the Minnet right now. It's called Ollie's Rehearsal, and this is how the artworks look like.
01:18:56.064 - 01:19:31.366, Speaker A: So I am just going to copy the smart contract address of this NFT project back to Ollie Share, select the network that he has been deployed to, which is Polygon mainnet, paste the address and retrieve the details to ensure that I'm connecting to the right project. So here we have all this rehearsal two owners. And let's say for this demo, I'm going to distribute just 0.5 metric. Click distribute, confirm the payment. All right. It says here, Transaction is successful.
01:19:31.366 - 01:19:54.530, Speaker A: Very nice. Now, on the other hand, let me show you what happens. Let's say if you are one of the recipients of the distributed revenue. So to show this, let me just log out this account, and I will log in with another account on MetaMask. Sign it. Okay. Now let's go to receive.
01:19:54.530 - 01:20:19.658, Speaker A: All right, over here, we have a dashboard to show how much this person has received. Again, you can see the project title here. It's called all this rehearsal. You see the total revenue that has been distributed by the creator so far. And over here, you can see the exact history of the transaction as well. And over here, the balance. So whenever this wasn't withdraws, the balance would become zero.
01:20:19.658 - 01:20:57.840, Speaker A: So let's try to withdraw right now. Let's confirm it, and we'll check the transaction over here to see if it successfully increased the amount. It's confirmed. Ready, but we are still waiting for the amount to increase. All right, so there we have it. This person has successfully received the distributed revenues from the creators. Now back to my slides.
01:20:57.840 - 01:21:37.920, Speaker A: So, in case you're wondering, ollie is a character that I've created, and I'm actually an NFT creator as well. What you're looking right now is the teaser trailer for my NFT project called Ollie's Audition Tape. Now, the reason why I built Ollie Share is because I have been looking high and low for a platform that can allow me to distribute revenues to all my NFT owners. But I can't find any, so I decided to build on my own. So what's next? Where do we go from here? Well, Ollie share is already online. It's live on the Polygon main net, although it's in Alpha Stage. But having said that, feel free to visit Ollie Share to give you a try, and you can let me know your feedback as well.
01:21:37.920 - 01:21:57.572, Speaker A: And if you're interested about my energy project, feel free to visit ollisolditiontips.com. And the QR code they're looking right now contains all my social media handles. If you are interested to reach out to connect, I'll be very happy to do so. And yeah, that's all for me. Thank you so much for having me here. Amazing. Thank you so much.
01:21:57.572 - 01:22:32.604, Speaker A: And this is so cool for you to share more about the illustrations and the animation you made. This is awesome, and I'm glad that you're able to do this live. So I hope you continue building this thing, and I'll be sure to check out the audition myself. All right, with that, we are ready for our next demo, and I want to welcome team Hashscan to come on and get started with showcasing what they built. Welcome, Xader. Hi, everyone. My name is Alex, and we've built Hashscan web free user analytics on this hackathon.
01:22:32.604 - 01:23:16.850, Speaker A: We worked in a team of three people. I worked on data and backend virtual, worked on frontend app, and Alex helped us with product. We've built event based analytics for user segments. Right now, if you have a community or a D app and you want to get an insight on your users on chain activity, you will have a hard time doing so. Most tools are very complicated and we want to build a new type of analytics which is different in two things. First, it is focused on users rather than protocols and projects. And second, it's easily accessible for non technical people so they can compose queries very fast.
01:23:16.850 - 01:23:44.456, Speaker A: Let me show you a demo. This is hashcan web app. First, you should select a segment of users. A segment of users can consist of multiple filters. For instance, this is a segment of users who owns at least one lobster dow NFT. We can see how the amount of those users changed over time. We can also take only users who owns at least ten of them.
01:23:44.456 - 01:25:00.050, Speaker A: What's more interesting, you can compose filters. Let's take a segment of those who owns at least one Board Ape Club Token and 75 Friends with Benefits Tokens, which is a full membership in that community. And we can see how this user segment, how amount of these users in this segment changed over time. Next, when you selected a segment, you can choose an event and you can see an event analytics for this user segment in this demo we've made analytics for Looksrare trades and you can see how many times holders of Board Ape Club traded in each day. On looksrare. We can take Mibits and compare it and we'll see that Mibits holders traded twice more. All right, what's interesting here is we can take for example, a user segment based on Ethereum activity and see how they interacted with Ava on Polygon because both chains are EVM compatible, which is cool.
01:25:00.050 - 01:25:58.292, Speaker A: In the future it would be interesting to support more type of events. For instance for filters, for instance, if you can get a segment of users who traded on OpenSea based on their trading events, and even further, it would be useful to allow you to import your segment of users from your backend. And then you can take those who are NFT trader and compare or just analyze which NFT marketplace they prefer, and you can make a product decision based on that. To do that, we scan smart contract events for a lot of data. We have to collect a lot of data. We place it in ClickHouse database, which is a database designed for analytics. It allows us to do very fast requests and queries from backend and reduce response time on Frontend app.
01:25:58.292 - 01:26:46.060, Speaker A: ClickHouse is also highly scalable and it fits very well for our use case. In the future we want to support event based analytics. We also ideally want to allow you to see and analyze events and smart contract calls of any smart contract. We also want to add more type of charts such as looking at unique users who performed an event, or looking at average time a user performed an event from a segment you have selected. Thank you. Hashcan is live. You can test it on Hashcan XYZ, follow us on Twitter and we plan to support and develop this project further.
01:26:46.060 - 01:27:22.990, Speaker A: If you have a DApp on protocol and you're interested in analytics like that, I would love to hear your ideas. Let's chat on Twitter. Thank you. Awesome. Alex and Team, thank you so much for that demo. And it is super awesome to see that you not only managed to do this cool thing that everybody needs right now, but it's also live and ready for others to try out. So congrats again and I hope everybody who's interested in getting their project supported on Hashcan reaches out to Alex and Team and get that integration going.
01:27:22.990 - 01:27:40.596, Speaker A: So we have two more demos to go and then we'll get to all the prizes. So without further ado, let's welcome Scribe. Hey, how's it going? I'm Marcus, artiscribe screen here. Cool.
01:27:40.778 - 01:28:11.336, Speaker G: So hi everybody. We're Scribe and we've created a transpiler that takes EVM compatible code and converts that to code that can run on Polygon's new ZK rollup network. Polygonmiden. So most developers know what Solidity is, but not everybody knows what Yule is. So Yule is this intermediary language between Solidity and the Ethereum virtual machine. So when a developer creates a contract in Solidity, it first compiles down to Yule and then compiles down to the EVM opcodes. So this allows a developer to have really low level control over smart contracts.
01:28:11.336 - 01:28:55.976, Speaker G: And this will come in handy as we talk about Scribe in the upcoming slides here. So another thing to be familiar with going into Scribe is Polygon MIDN. So MIDN is Polygon's new ZK roll up network, which is a Stark based ZK roll up, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. And there are no delays between L1 and L two transfers. So this opens up a lot of use cases that can be really cool, but out of the box, MIDN isn't EVM compatible and that's where Scribe comes in. So what Scribe does is it takes EVM compatible code and it translates it, then compiles it down to run on the mining VM. So the way that actually works is it takes a Yule contract and first converts it into a string, then passing it into some grammar parsing logic.
01:28:55.976 - 01:29:46.700, Speaker G: So this logic is looking for statements and expressions in Yule and packs those all together to create an abstract syntax tree and then passes it to the mining assembly logic that actually creates the mining opcodes that can run on the mining VM. So there's some really big benefits to this. First Solidity, Viper and Yule plus all compile to Yule, which means that a smart contract developer can write a contract in solidity and then compile it to Yule and then use scribe to actually have that code run on the mining VM. Second, it allows developers to use high level constructs like variables and not have to deviate from familiar design patterns or frameworks that they already use. And lastly, it allows for interoperability between the Ethereum virtual machine and the mining virtual machine, again allowing developers to focus on writing good, clean, secure code and less time worrying about environments and tooling.
01:29:47.680 - 01:30:17.312, Speaker A: We got a quick demo here about how scribe works in practice. So we've got some contracts here that we're going to be demoing. You can see we've got like an addition contract defining a couple of variables. Then we got a Fibonacci example and we got this binary called scribe. And you just run it and it's in interactive mode now so it'll show you the steps. And so simple example, if you want to add one to the result of multiplying two and three here, then we're going to parse this, we're going to turn it into this, AST you can see the expressions there. And then that's going to turn into MIDN assembly.
01:30:17.312 - 01:31:02.960, Speaker A: And the core operation in MIDN is like dealing with the stack. And so here it's going to push one onto the stack, then two, then three, and then it's going to call multiply which will pop two and three off, multiply them together and push six back onto the stack. Then we're going to call the add operation which will add that one and six that's remaining on the stack together. And then when we run that through the MIDN virtual machine, we're going to get seven. Then we can also handle variables, which of course are not by default supported in midnvm. So we need to keep track of where they are in memory and stuff. So when you run that you can see our AST can parse it and get the declarations and the references and then this is the code that it'll generate and it'll push the literals that we've used for the variables into the stack.
01:31:02.960 - 01:31:38.288, Speaker A: And then it's going to pop that from the stack into memory. And then later on when we need it again, it's going to push it from the memory into the stack again. So that'll give us 43 results of adding 42 and one. And then here, this is just a generator that will find the twelveTH Fibonacci number written. Newell and AST is pretty big. I won't go through all of it, but you can see we've now got for loops, conditionals blocks, assignment, all that good stuff. And there's a lot of mining assembly that it generates, but the result of it is 89, which is the twelveTH Fibonacci number.
01:31:38.288 - 01:31:42.320, Speaker A: So, yeah, been really fun to work on this. Back to you, Dan.
01:31:44.020 - 01:31:49.760, Speaker G: So, yeah, this has been an awesome hackathon. The team is myself, Ox, Kitsune, Control.
01:31:49.830 - 01:31:51.636, Speaker A: C plus Control V, who couldn't be.
01:31:51.658 - 01:32:19.724, Speaker G: Here for the presentation, but has been a huge, huge part of this project. And then Marcus Buffett, who's been integral to this as well. In the future, we're looking to complete Yulegrammer add end to end compatibility from Solidity all the way down to the mining VM and more. And we're super excited to carry this forward. So this has been an awesome experience. We've learned a tremendous amount and a huge, huge thank you to ETHGlobal Polygon, all the sponsors, and a big congratulations to all the other hackers. This has been absolutely awesome.
01:32:19.724 - 01:32:20.990, Speaker G: Thanks again, everybody.
01:32:23.040 - 01:32:54.692, Speaker A: Thank you so much. And I am still blown away, but you managed to eat this thing over the basically three days. And this is such a cool way to kind of get everybody to go into ZK roll ups and make that easy for everybody to try out what's possible with EVM compatibility. So congrats and I hope you continue building this. And we want to definitely get to full compatibility here. All right, so with that, we are ready for our last demo of the day. And without further ado, I'd like to welcome Beep XYZ.
01:32:54.692 - 01:32:56.010, Speaker A: So whenever you're ready.
01:32:56.860 - 01:33:14.252, Speaker H: Yeah. Hey, guys. So that was awesome, scribe, awesome project. But I'm here to present Beep XYZ. Just let me share my screen real quick. All right, so here we go. Bead XYZ is the cold messaging of Web Three.
01:33:14.252 - 01:34:07.244, Speaker H: So before we get into the demo, which I'm super excited about, let's just see why kind of let's just talk through why cold messaging really sucks in Web Two. So I just took a casual screenshot of my discord of someone maybe having thousands of bot accounts to promote their own project, which lead to the problem of really bad spam for casual platforms like Discord. So this lead to not a good user experience, but on the other end of the spectrum, we have more professional networks like LinkedIn, which basically is pay us to message our users. Like, did you know a recruiter plan costs 9000 per year? And people are paying for those plans in order to cold message people that they are not connected to. But as users, we are not getting any of that money. So really not cool. And this is why I have Beep XYZ.
01:34:07.244 - 01:34:37.416, Speaker H: It is completely address to address. So the other person does not need a Beep account for you to be able to message them, you only need their address. And in a second, I'm going to demonstrate all three of those points. And why is it so much better than the alternatives in Web Two? Here we go. So I am playing as Phoenix, and my good friend and partner Boba FET is looking to add more muscles to our team.
01:34:37.598 - 01:34:37.944, Speaker A: Right?
01:34:37.982 - 01:35:40.264, Speaker H: And I know this really good hunter, this Mandalorian, he's phenomenal, but he's not super tech savvy, so he doesn't yet have a Beep XYZ account. However, I have his address, so I am still able to message him. I'm just going to give him my usual recruiting template looking for some side cash. So, as you can see, since he's not following me back and he's not yet using Beep XYZ, I have to stake some token in order to message request him. So think of this maybe as the LinkedIn email of web3, right? But instead of a centralized entity like LinkedIn, obviously taking all the profit, when I sign that transaction, I am authorizing Mando to withdraw the tokens that I have staked for him whenever he accepts my message request. So the money directly goes into Mando's wallet. It's no longer LinkedIn.
01:35:40.264 - 01:36:14.968, Speaker H: We don't need any middlemen. All right, so it's all done. And now I will be role playing as Mando. I heard of this really cool website, Deep XYZ, where I can get some side hustle, and I am always down for some side cash, so I'm logging in for the first have. I do not have an existing account, right? So I don't have any message. But I got a message request on Phoenix looking for some side cash. So, yes, I am looking for some side cash, so I will accept her request.
01:36:14.968 - 01:37:03.134, Speaker H: And whenever I accept a message request, I am basically accepting a friend request in web two, so I am able to message Phoenix freely from their point on, so she does not need to stake any more token in order to message me. I guess we can think of this as a LinkedIn connection. Once we have accepted each other, we can message each other freely. So the transaction is done and Phoenix's message is in my main inbox. All right, that worked out. So I'm going to just wrap up the presentation. I don't want to take any more time before the prizes.
01:37:03.134 - 01:37:24.502, Speaker H: So I think just maybe some final thoughts. Think of how many websites you actually have your credit card entered in order to pay someone, right? Like, a lot, right? I can think of maybe tens, maybe hundreds, a lot of websites. But think about the other side. How many websites do you actually have your bank information there in order to get paid?
01:37:24.636 - 01:37:25.174, Speaker A: Right?
01:37:25.292 - 01:37:51.674, Speaker H: I don't know. I don't have that many. So I think this is really the key driver here and this is really what enable us to pay someone directly to message request them, instead of having a middleman like LinkedIn obviously capturing all the value. So thank you. I'm at Beep XYZ on Twitter. I'm also looking for inviting the first users to try out the app. The website is Beep XYZ.
01:37:51.674 - 01:37:56.930, Speaker H: You guessed it. So thank you. Thanks for having me there and thanks Kartik.
01:37:57.830 - 01:38:38.494, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for demoing and building this cool app. I hope lots of other people get to try it out too. All right, well, that concludes all 15 of our demos, and I want to thank all these amazing teams for kind of coming on here and doing these things live. It's always a nervous moment for everybody where you don't know if the live demo is going to work or not work. And I so glad to not only see that everything worked out really well, but I just want to quickly point out that majority of these products that you saw were already live and ready for main net and that is just incredible.

So congratulations to all four of these teams and that's all the prizes. Quick note on prize delivery. So there's a lot that goes on in collecting and managing and distributing these things, so we get these questions all the time. So I want to just quickly highlight that and we'll be relaying the same comments again. We'll be connecting you with some of the sponsors who are delivering these prizes on their own and there are some of them that the Ethgobal team will be delivering.
01:43:36.042 - 01:44:43.646, Speaker A: And before we send out any prize, your code base and your GitHub repo will be verified to make sure that nobody cheated before the events. And if you were one of those winners and it turns out that you submitted something that was against the rules, your price will be rescinded and we will not be honoring that amount. On top of that, most prizes will be distributed by the 18th, which is next Friday. So that's a little bit over almost ten days from now. This gives us enough time to collect all the information, manage everything from checking everybody's code base to verifying where everything should be sent and for any pool prizes. Where if you are not one of these teams and you realize that you applied for a pool prize and you should have qualified, but you were not one of them, we have a 48 hours window here to dispute any changes or bring up any other issues that you have for the pool prizes. And after the 48 hours window from today, we will be freezing all the actual final list and only those people in that list will be receiving the prizes.
01:44:43.646 - 01:45:36.850, Speaker A: So if you think there's an error from either side, reach out to us ASAP on Discord because we will not be doing anything after the 48 hours window. So this brings us to the end of Road to Web Three. This has been an incredible last five, six days. And before we kind of wrap everything up, I want to quickly give some thank yous before we kind of close the event. So I want to quickly thank all of our judges, mentors, volunteers, speakers and sponsors. There's so many people behind the scenes that help out with running these events, especially at the scale which is officially our biggest event ever in size, outcomes, attendees, every metric we can think of. And I want to congratulate all the teams, of course, but I want to especially thank all of our judges and mentors who were there, talking to all the projects, giving feedback, and honestly, just helping everybody.
01:45:36.850 - 01:46:25.314, Speaker A: Whether it was at 02:00 p.m or 02:00 A.m. With anywhere from bugs to best practices to pointing out how to check out different existing libraries to make yourselves not spend too much time on various things to get the project going and just want to thank everybody for the time they put in. And without their help, we would not be able to make this event super successful. I want to also thank all of our speakers. So we had an amazing summit, we had an amazing set of workshops and talks, so all these incredible people were here talking to us and getting us excited about what's happening in Web Three, especially from the perspective of people trying in from Web Two, trying to learn more about Web Three. And I also want to thank all of our volunteers who help to run things smoothly in the back end because you only see things that kind of interface with the public side, but it requires so many incredible people.
01:46:25.314 - 01:47:25.430, Speaker A: Making sure that everything is actually running smoothly and managing anyone from coordination to parallelization that we have to do for a lot of the events. Then I also want to thank all of our incredible sponsors and partners who were here helping out people with anywhere, from requests on how to use the SDK, to debugging, to docs, to giving them feedback on the live sessions and doing workshops and talks. There's so many people here that made all of this possible. And a quick shout out to everybody that gave us their time to get a few hundred more of you into this space. And lastly, I want to thank all of you as hackers, there's 1200 of you from so many different parts of the world and without your time and dedication and your excitement, this would literally not happen as an event. And congrats to all of you for kind of sticking to the end, making some incredible projects, and staying up at OD hours to get feedback or attend a workshop or present your project to all of our judges. And we're super fortunate to have all of your support.
01:47:25.430 - 01:48:13.682, Speaker A: And I'm really happy to hear that a lot of you and so many of you enjoyed this experience. And I hope to see all of you again, not only just in this space, but also at featured global events. I also want to give a quick shout out to the Global team that made all this possible with all the behind the scenes work to make these events run as smoothly as they do. So I want to quickly thank Cree, Huricchi, Minnie and OS, luke, Emily, Andrew, Jacob, Heather and Liam from the youth global team. And without their help in making sure that everything is on track, this event won't be possible. So before we wrap things up, we had 15 teams present live what they built, and we call them our finalists. And if you've never been to any global event before, we use this word very deliberately.
01:48:13.682 - 01:49:02.562, Speaker A: We call them finalists because we don't want these events to be a competition where we have a notion of first, 2nd, 3rd. These events are very much an avenue to learn and experiment with what's possible. And we want this to be about showcasing interesting and creative ideas and just that only. So we call them finalists because officially, all these teams are our actual winners tied in for the first spot. And that is what we're going to tell them now that all of you have officially won this event. And as part of that, every team that presented will be winning $5,000 per project from the Polygon team for being our 15 finalists. And on top of that, ETH Global Team will be giving $1,000 per member for each of these teams in addition.
01:49:02.562 - 01:49:56.086, Speaker A: And this is kind of the prize for all these amazing projects that came on and demoed in addition to any partner and sponsor prizes they may have won. So I want to give a big shout out to all these teams so all 15 of you for demoing and all the teams that just won all the amazing prizes from all the sponsors. With all these prizes, we end up nearing $300,000 in total for prizes given out for just this event. And I want to congratulate all of you from every part of the world for giving your time, building something amazing and choosing to continue building it after today. But wait, there's more. Not only are those prizes being given to everybody else, but we have two more amazing things we want to give out to everybody who participated. So anybody who submitted a project for this hackathon will be receiving this road to Web Three shirt for free.
01:49:56.086 - 01:50:48.300, Speaker A: And we'll be following up with an email for you to claim your t shirt after this event. So if you submitted a project specifically not just participated, submitted, if you're one of those 310 teams, you will be receiving a free t shirt anywhere in the world. And on top of that, everybody who submitted a project will also be receiving a roast to Web Three NFT. That is this interactive amazing artwork that the Polygon team designed for all of our participants. And you'll be getting a link to claim this NFT to show that you were part of this incredible event and so far the biggest event in global history. So a big congratulations to all 1200 of you for making this event possible and building really amazing things and just doing what you're excited about. So congrats and hope you enjoyed this experience and this concludes Road to Web Three.
01:50:48.300 - 01:51:41.270, Speaker A: So lastly, just before we close, this won't be any global event unless without us telling you what's next. So without further ado, I'm super excited to announce that our next hackathon is going to be called Build Quest and it's going to be starting on the 4 March which is just about a month from now and will be going on for twelve days. So March 4 to 16th and Billquest is going to be an event especially about building games and metaverse. So we're already seeing so much cool creative games here as part of the finalists and as part of this hackathon. And we're going to now do a dedicated event in collaboration with Protocol Labs about gaming and the metaverse. So I hope to see all of you participate in our next hackathon. We have a lot more coming up in the next few months as events, but as of right now, Billquest is live so I hope all of you check it out and apply to attend.
01:51:41.270 - 01:52:10.850, Speaker A: You can head over to Billquest Eatglobal.com and sign up for this event and hope to see some really cool games and metaverse hacks in a month. So with that, I want to thank everybody for taking the time today and being here with us on this live stream, but also for this entire event and I hope you enjoyed this experience. And with that I'd like to sign off and wish everybody a great rest of the week and we'll see you all in a few weeks. So take care everybody and hope you have a great rest of your day. Bye bye.
