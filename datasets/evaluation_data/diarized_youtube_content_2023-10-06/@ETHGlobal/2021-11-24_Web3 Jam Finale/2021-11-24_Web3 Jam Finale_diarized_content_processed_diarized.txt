00:04:02.470 - 00:04:36.450, Speaker A: GM. Good afternoon and good evening, everybody. My name is Kartik, one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the Web Three Jam finale. So you're all watching this thing on Ethgobal TV, and for those of you who are joining us for the first time, I encourage all of you to log in and say hi. If you have any questions that come up during this event, we'll be able to answer them for you from the chat directly. And anybody who signs in and kind of engages with the audience will be receiving a co app token at the end. So this event is brought to you by ETH Global.
00:04:36.450 - 00:05:31.960, Speaker A: And ETH Global is an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to bring in thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem, and we do this thing primarily by running hackathons and summits. And Web Three gem is our last event of the year. It's a hackathon that invited 410 hackers from 51 different countries, spending 17 different time zones to work over the past week on really interesting and creative Web Three projects. This is an incredible map showing where everybody came from as a participant. We're super excited to see all the diversity and the different perspectives everybody brought in for this hackathon. And on top of these representation of the cities, we had over 20 ecosystem mentors, six technical mentors, and twelve ecosystem partners that were here with us throughout the entire events to help all of our attendees get help in finishing their projects or getting unblocked if they needed any technical help.
00:05:31.960 - 00:06:33.254, Speaker A: And not only that, we had over $100,000 in prizes to be won from this event. So today we're going to be going through everything that happened over the past ten days. This event has absolutely been incredible. We had 101 incredible projects come out of it. And yesterday, on Monday, two days ago, we went through the judging process for all of these 100 projects and we landed on ten finalists who we will be showcasing today in this live call. So without further ado, I'd like to congratulate these ten incredible teams in no particular order, I want to give a shout out to Tweeter 3ft, DiveACTOR, Seashells, Crypto, Murals, Trends, Dimensional Inventory Service, NFTs, Focher, ENS, Me, and backer. These are our ten teams that will be coming on stage today and showcasing live what they built over the course of the hackathon.
00:06:33.254 - 00:07:16.098, Speaker A: And then after that, we'll go into all the prizes that everybody's won from this event. So I know a lot of you are eager for prizes, so you're going to have to just sit tight a little bit longer until we go through all the incredible demos. And as we were looking at not only just these ten teams, but also throughout what actually happened for those 101 submissions, we saw some incredible and common themes for all of our projects. Decentralized media. NFTs were obviously the most common thing that everybody was excited about. This kind of blends in everything from real world art to NFTs in general to gaming to video streaming, you name it, you're going to see a lot of that today. And of course, there was a lot of DeFi and analytics.
00:07:16.098 - 00:08:22.350, Speaker A: People are still making it easy for us to understand what's happening on chain and that's going to be an evergreen sort of category for us to continue improving. And on top of that, there are an amazing set and amount of tools and projects we saw that are building tools and other utilities around, making it easy for everyday folks to play and experiment and try out what's happening in all of Web Three. So these ten presentations will cover a lot of these topics and themes and I can't wait to get started. But before we jump into our very first demo, I want to quickly take a second and give a huge round of applause and shout out to these 91 projects here, who did amazing work over the past ten days for this hackathon and demoed their projects to the judges. Got some feedback, got some great amount of eyes and users and even bug reports from our community throughout the hackathon. And just because you were not one of those ten teams, it does not mean you were not good enough. We're going to really make sure that we are here to give you support and you have the ability to sort of continue working on this project.
00:08:22.350 - 00:09:06.894, Speaker A: And if you need help, whether it's technical or on the product side or just if you are trying to make this bigger than a hackathon project, we can help with all those things. So really encourage all of you to continue working on these projects. The time that we had for this event was obviously not a lot to sort of see everything come to fruition. So really encourage all of you to continue working. And we're just blown away by the incredible amount of talent that came in for this event. So without further ado, we can get started with our demos. And before I jump into our very first demo, I want to just quickly let everybody know that if you want to see what these 100 plus projects were, you can head over to Showcase Ethglobal.com
00:09:06.894 - 00:09:46.182, Speaker A: and you can see a list of all the projects that came out of Web three jam and watch anything from their demos to their source code to read about how they work architecturally and under the hood. All right, so enough talking, let's get started with our demos. So what we're going to do is we're going to invite these teams back to back and they're going to come on present Live what they did and then we'll move on to the next team. We won't be able to do any questions because of time this time around. So we're going to have three teams come on and the first one is going to be ENS Me, and then we'll have three feed and then crypto murals. So let's get started with our very first demo. I'd like to welcome Tom to showcase.
00:09:46.182 - 00:09:47.354, Speaker A: ENS me.
00:09:47.472 - 00:09:48.140, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:09:49.390 - 00:10:30.722, Speaker C: Hi there. Thank you very much. So, my name is Tom Wade. I'm based in England and I'm a solo team that created ENS Me, a project aiming to visualize a user's ENS domain to create a single linktree esque landing page quickly, easily and effectively and directly from ENS for the data. Not only that, but I really wanted to persist the information that was stored across external decentralized applications through using IPFS. There's also a small second application that forms part of ENS Me, but I'll come on to that a little later. So this is an ENS domain at its source.
00:10:30.722 - 00:11:32.780, Speaker C: I've used Nick ETH's domain for this example as it's quite well populated, but we could just use any domain. So we all know that text records aren't that sexy, but currently, if you own an ENS domain, then this is what you're faced with. The default ENS record keys do provide much more interesting data than traditional domains. And one of the things I was really excited about is this gives us a lot more flexibility in what we can display in the information that we can pull through. So through querying the graph and hitting the chain directly with Ethers JS, I was able to create a user friendly representation of an ENS domain. So we can see here, on the same Nick ETH profile that I just showed you, we can pull through the ETH address and then proceed to send Ethereum directly to his wallet. We can link out to his website, mail him at his email address, go through, follow him on Twitter, view his GitHub and connect on Discord as well as at the bottom, we're able to directly link up to the ENS domain there.
00:11:32.780 - 00:12:10.338, Speaker C: And just to mention, this is all pulled directly through. There's no information edited from Nick here. This is all just direct. And if I go through to my profile, we can see that it's admittedly a little bit better than Nick's. You can see that I've only got my Ethereum wallet address and a link out to ENS as I haven't further populated my information. And my vatar is also blank because I haven't put anything there yet. But if I go to hit Manage, because I'm the owner of this ENS address and I'm connected via MetaMask, I can now see the full extent of the data that could be pulled through if it was populated.
00:12:10.338 - 00:13:37.780, Speaker C: So if I wanted, I could go through, say I want to disable Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin and just leave Ethereum if they're pulled through, disable my GitHub and Twitter, et cetera, I can go through and start disabling things. So if I disable DNS and I can also go in, set a few colors and start to customize the colors that will be pulled through onto my profile and I explain why I'm a little bit excited about that soon as well. So if I hit update profile and then skip to the here's one I did earlier effect, we can see I've got a nice light pink background, my button's green colors change slightly to my preference and I've also hidden out the links that I wasn't wanting. So there's no cost for this as all of the information stored directly to IPFS via Pinata and I was quite happy that that could then be persisted and indexed and also made public. And the reason why I wanted that to happen was if a user was then to query IPFS or add preferences to the end of their URL, we can start to see what a user's preferences is that are stored. So if I come in through here I can see that I want to display my avatar, I want to display email and website, but these are my preferred background colors. So if another decentralized app wanted to query this data, once they connected their ENS they can instantly get a range of preferences and data and pull them through to their application directly and start to customize the user experience over there.
00:13:37.780 - 00:14:45.206, Speaker C: So for the profiles in the coming weeks, I'm going to be working with a small team to help develop the profile to start making it a little bit more impressive. Start pulling through richer media content such as a user's latest tweets rather than just a link to their Twitter profile. Starting to incorporate pulling through NFTs from a subsection of what a user has in their wallet. Start to create a little bit of a gallery. And my real goal is to create a visualization of an ENS profile that a user would be proud to share and start to also offer that to decentralized applications as a central source. So the second aspect that I briefly mentioned at the start of this talk is one that I actually used to obtain my ENS domain at the start of this hack. So by querying GraphQL I was able to build a small application that pulls in expiring and recently expired ENS domains and then allowing them to be filtered, getting domain stats and also factoring in like cooldown periods for when they'll become fully available and then starting to estimate the costs associated with that cooldown period.
00:14:45.206 - 00:15:54.682, Speaker C: From looking at traditional domain offerings, this is relatively common but I found it to be a really useful tool at the start and also quite quick to prototype. I'll be continuing to work on this too to pull through additional domain information, additional filters, reminders and pull in ENS domains that are on the secondary market as well. So we can see there's recently expired domains if you're looking to start a new project and you can also filter by keywords in the ENS domain and the previous number of years it was registered for. So if you were looking at a know all service, you know Enslogin e is available now, so don't waste time. I'm sure millions of people are watching, just gagging to register that. So with a combination of these two apps, I'm actually really excited to continue building tools that will further the ENS ecosystem and start to look at decentralized identification, which has got me really excited about Web Three, really? So, yeah, as a bit of an outro, please feel free to try out at ENS Me and then your ENS domain. And I'd also love to welcome you to join a fresh discord community that I've set up for keeping up to date with announcements and the roadmap, which can be found at ENS Me slash Discord.
00:15:54.682 - 00:15:56.000, Speaker C: Thank you very much.
00:15:57.410 - 00:15:57.918, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:15:58.004 - 00:16:16.440, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Tom. This is awesome. Not only is it an incredibly useful thing, especially right now in this community, it's live. So anybody who's interested in checking this out, head over to ENS Me. With that, we are ready to move on to our second demo for the day, and that is Project 3ft. So I'd like to welcome Chris and Caleb to get started.
00:16:17.530 - 00:16:48.666, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. I'm Caleb, I'm based in Victoria, Canada, and my partner here is Chris, and I'm based out of Canada as well. So welcome here to Three Feed. I hope everyone can see my screen. Okay, three Feed is meant to be a modern feed reader system and content publishing platform. So we're going to jump right in here. So everything is hosted using Ceramic, which passes everything through to IPFS.
00:16:48.666 - 00:17:21.526, Speaker D: So everything you're seeing here is actually being pulled through a fleek gateway. So the app is hosted on fleek, which again means it's hosted on IPFS. Everything passes through. So you can see we just kind of have a base publishing platform here. It's completely built with React and NextJS, but it's meant to be a little familiar to those who use standard systems. We have here is your ID. So the ID is based on the distributed Identifier from Ceramic, so that's unique to each person and use that to follow creators.
00:17:21.526 - 00:17:52.130, Speaker D: So you can see here, I've actually already followed someone who conveniently has published Huckleberry Finn. So you can see here, I can go in, read to my heart's content, jump back, everything works well. But what might be more interesting is this publishing platform. Just jump there for now so we can enter really quick. Hi. And then I'll put something a little bigger in. So you can see I just got some blank text, but actually it'd be nicer if this was a title.
00:17:52.130 - 00:18:11.802, Speaker D: I want to call out this Lorem Ipsum as well, and I'm going to pull that. So this is all just like a fully featured, rich content editor. The user can access how they want. And we're going to go down here. We actually want to publish this now. And I feel like I put a lot of work in. So I want to actually make this paid.
00:18:11.802 - 00:18:53.302, Speaker D: So the paid publishing is provided through unlock, which means right now, when I press this button, we're going to connect to the unlock smart contract just on the Rinkabee test network. The fees look good to me, and this is going to publish a smart contract that's going to lock our content. So right now, that's what's happening is this is all processing live on the test network. And as soon as that contract's ready, we'll see the pop up confirmed, and it's going to drop us right into that article, which is now live on IPFS. Here we go. Looks nice. And we can jump back.
00:18:53.302 - 00:19:14.494, Speaker D: And unfortunately, you can't see it. So for the demo, actually, I wanted to demonstrate our subscription feed. So I'm actually going to subscribe to myself so that I can see my own content. That's just for the demo. It takes a couple of seconds here. Your actual feed is going on IPFS, and that's going to come around. I'll pop up so we can see our article that we just published here.
00:19:14.494 - 00:19:29.490, Speaker D: But actually, you know what? I just wrote that. I just looked at it. I don't actually want to view that. Now let's check out this thing. Never heard of Alice in Wonderland before. I click on it, you can see it's locked. So here's kind of the fee to unlock.
00:19:29.490 - 00:20:17.090, Speaker D: And those who are familiar with these kind of transactions will see that the gas fees are quite high, but that's just for the demo. We want to go quick here. So what this is doing now, we're interacting with the unlock protocol, but the lock contract from the unlock protocol, it's going to verify that we have access to this article. And you'll see in a few seconds, that transaction will go through and will be dropped right into our Alice in Wonderland article. So basically, as you can see, what we have here is a very simple demo of what this kind of futuristic content authoring system looks like. So you can see here, okay, we dropped right in. And now that we've unlocked it, we don't have to unlock it again.
00:20:17.090 - 00:21:03.298, Speaker D: We just have access. And that's stored on the well, it'll eventually be the Ethereum main net, but for now, it's on the Rinkp testnet. But just want to say, this is kind of our very bare bones. In the future, we want to integrate with the ceramic Identifier, like the self ID system, which will allow us to kind of move away from these ugly DIDs and get into more profiles similar to what ENS me is offering as well. The unlock contract supports things like subscriptions, which we haven't baked in. So there's a lot here that we'd like to flesh out, as well as adding support for things like email and discovery feeds, which can be hosted in a decentralized fashion. So lot here.
00:21:03.298 - 00:21:07.410, Speaker D: Thank you for listening and goodbye from Three feed.
00:21:09.830 - 00:21:32.140, Speaker A: Caleb and Chris, thank you so much for that awesome demo. And yeah, this is exciting. Can't wait to get more and more decentralized version of existing services that we use up on Mainnet. So with that we are ready for our third demo and that is going to be Project Cryptomurals. So I'll have the Crypto Murals team come on and get started.
00:21:32.910 - 00:21:33.660, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:21:43.410 - 00:22:00.770, Speaker E: Everyone and welcome to Crypto Murals, the new way to start collecting street art on the blockchain. I'm nattere Hiraldo, a designer and digital art producer from Colombia. We teamed up with Claudio Chinoris, a developer and musician from Patagonia, Argentina, but live in France.
00:22:02.950 - 00:22:05.220, Speaker B: Here, sorry.
00:22:07.350 - 00:22:31.440, Speaker E: Cryptomurals is a web three platform to collect curated street art around the world as dynamic NFTs web support creators, muralists, motion designers, festivals, the platform, and the public art heritage. I would like to share with you our short video before starting the demo please. Maybe the sound is not going to come out so I'm just going to play it like this.
00:22:42.980 - 00:22:44.480, Speaker A: We don't have audio.
00:22:46.900 - 00:23:31.660, Speaker E: So just continue. So in the video you can see the QR code that you can scan with your phone and open the gateway to go to Crypto Murals and the Overlap Reality Experience. So I'm going to go around the overlap reality experience. Here is a demo on how the overlap reality works. Once you scan the QR code, you will land into a dedicated web app of the mural that will show you the artist, the motion designer and the owner's address. Then you will hit the live experience and the geolocation will be activated. Then you will find the image target that you will need to match with the paint in front of you or click on it to enjoy the animation.
00:23:31.660 - 00:24:18.750, Speaker E: At the end of the experience you will be able to place a bid and you will be redirected to the Cryptomurals It website. So once you connect your wallet, you will see the NFT marketplace with all the information related to the NFT. You'll also have the option to see all the murals around the world who has been geolocated. We invite you to go and catch them during your trips. So now we're going to our live demo MVP. We use NFT port to deploy our smart contracts and store our metadata on the interpretary file system, IPFS and file coins such as your location and the animations. So here we are in our website.
00:24:18.750 - 00:24:51.272, Speaker E: So here we have the login. Here you can log out as well. So here you can see the NFT and then you can place a bid to buy it. Right now it is not available to buy it, but here we are in the admin section. So we will have these options like start the auction like minting NFT and upload the image. Also here we have for example the minter. We have the sorry, I have the minter here.
00:24:51.272 - 00:25:34.200, Speaker E: So here we can choose the file, just upload it as regular, and here we will have to wait a little bit until the minting is completed. Then we also have the action launcher that will be allowed to mint and to start the action. For the murals that we will start collecting. We also have this media blogger to connect to the IPFS. So we continue with our presentation. Here we can see the deployment of the contracts where we can see the four parties and the description of the NFT. The idea here is to share all the sales between the creators and crypto murals.
00:25:34.200 - 00:26:08.848, Speaker E: So for our next steps, we are planning to go mainnet with dynamic NFTs, linking with live peer for live streaming gamification with rewards, community tokens, and metaverse integration. We want to have a sprint test with five artists and motion designers to get ready for the International Public Art Festival on June 2022 in Europe. So thanks so much for your time. Cryptomiros will be on the streets very soon. If you want to be up to date, please follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Discord. Have a good one everybody.
00:26:09.014 - 00:26:28.090, Speaker A: Bye bye, thank you so much. That was an awesome overview of cryptomurals and yeah, I'm more and more excited to see what projects are doing to bring in and blend in the real world art with smart contracts and NFT. So this has been amazing. Thank you so much.
00:26:29.180 - 00:26:30.200, Speaker B: Bye bye.
00:26:30.940 - 00:26:44.510, Speaker A: Next up, we have our second group of projects, so we're going to invite Backer, Transdimensional, Inventory Service and Future to come on and present. And without further ado, let's welcome Mark from Backer to share what he built.
00:26:45.520 - 00:27:26.300, Speaker B: Hi, my name is Mark Kerry from Toronto, Canada. And I'm here to present Backer, which is a web three version of Petras. Get paid by their backers. Creators can get paid an ERC 20 token of their choice. This gets streamed in real time from the Backer to the creator using the Superfluid Protocol. Creators define multiple tiers of membership. At the same time, they launch their own ERC 20 token, which gets streamed to Active Backers.
00:27:26.300 - 00:28:18.572, Speaker B: Higher tiers can receive a higher multiplier of creator tokens to provide that extra incentive to use the higher tiers, each tier deploys a lock on the unlock protocol, and Active Backers get an NFT key that can be used to access membership benefits for that tier. Specifically, the onboarding process takes only about five minutes and a creator can be set up and ready to go. But I don't have that much time for the demo, so I'm going to show the onboarding screens really quick here as slides first, of course, creator Connect Wallet choose the token that they want to get paid in. In this example, I'm choosing Dai. Name your own Backer token symbol the number of tokens you want to pre mint. Create your first tier, choose name price and the multiplier. Here's an example.
00:28:18.572 - 00:29:03.064, Speaker B: After creating three tiers, and the next step would be to create a creator profile, name, description, some images, social links. All this profile data gets saved to IPFS and the CID gets stored in the smart contract. Okay, with that we can move on to the live demo. So we're going to start off here not as a creator, but as a prospective backer. So I'm looking at a profile here, a creator profile here. And I can see the information, the photos, the social links, and here are the tiers that we saw before. So I'm going to join the fan tier here and I should going to cost me ten die per month.
00:29:03.064 - 00:29:54.680, Speaker B: And I'm going to earn 100 run tokens per month. Just waiting for a MetaMask here. This is all live on the Rinkabee network, if you want to give it a try. There we go. So, confirmation that I've joined. So I can hit this link to add the run tokens to my MetaMask. So they'll show up there and you can see the custom icon that I chose when I saved my profile.
00:29:54.680 - 00:30:53.408, Speaker B: So one thing show quickly. Trying to change tabs here, but zoom is in my way. What do I want to do? Here we go. Quickly. As the user here, I can see in the Superfluid dashboard, I can see the two streams now. The payment I'm making to the creator and what I'm getting back. You can ignore the dollar amounts for now because Superfluid doesn't really understand how much a run token is worth.
00:30:53.408 - 00:31:46.000, Speaker B: And perhaps nobody else does either. Let's go back to the app and I'm going to switch to the creator view of this same one. So I just got to switch. Users land here on the dashboard and I get graphs of the balance and the flows that are coming in. And you can see here the balances of the run token. You can see how you can see that the balances are changing here in real time because these are flowing in and out via Superfluid. Some other stats here as well.
00:31:46.000 - 00:32:15.814, Speaker B: Here's a list of members, various tiers. You can sort this and filter it. You can see how many backer tokens they have in their wallet. So you can see who are the big supporters, the revenue to date. If you look closely here, you'll see that these revenue and backer tokens, they're constantly changing because these are real time streams. The tiers tab, we kind of saw this before on the slides. I can add more tiers here.
00:32:15.814 - 00:32:35.018, Speaker B: Profile. This is where I can change my profile. Upload photos to IPFS, can preview the profile. There it is again. We saw this on the balance tab. This is where the creator can withdraw funds from the account that they've earned from creators. There's a tab here for their own token.
00:32:35.018 - 00:33:28.030, Speaker B: And here they can send tokens to members of the community or anybody. These don't get streamed, they get sent directly. Over here we have an NFT tab that's coming soon and that's about it. Another thing here I won't show is you can add team members who can also view the dashboard. Next steps. As I mentioned NFTs feature, I'd like to offer the ability to create NFT collections and mint NFTs either for auction, sale, or just for community rewards. I'd like to create a public directory or showcase of creators using I also like to get some feedback and advice from crypto content creators because I see them as potential early adopters, a convenience layer for enabling credit card subscriptions.
00:33:28.030 - 00:33:55.910, Speaker B: It's not very decentralized, but I think opening up the audience to people who are not quite ready to use MetaMask and such would make sense. Finally looking towards a polygon launch, mainly due to the high gas costs, which are a big barrier to both offering and subscribing in this kind of a scenario. That's it for backer.
00:33:57.290 - 00:34:15.920, Speaker A: Thanks so much, Mark. Real time memberships is awesome. Can't wait to see more of this and I wish you all this deployed on mainnet. Next up, we have Transdimensional Inventory service and Will will be here to tell us what he built. Whenever you're ready.
00:34:21.810 - 00:34:53.606, Speaker F: Hi, everyone. My name is Will. I'm a student at the University of Waterloo and I created Tis or the Transdimensional Inventory Service. So Tis is inventory for the metaverse. What is the Metaverse supposed to be? It's supposed to be a shared digital universe to live in. Right now, the Metaverse is many separate web two universes. Tis provides a way to share a common inventory across multiple metaverses.
00:34:53.606 - 00:35:40.458, Speaker F: It bridges the gap between web three and current metaverse technology. Tis provides a framework that can be used with current metaverse technology in order to access future metaverse data. So here's a demo of me using Tis to bring my NFTs into Roblox. So I created this place in Roblox that allows me to show off my NFTs to my friends. So if I just click here, it loads a list of my NFTs on polygon. So my regular NFTs are just shown as like this. It tells me the name of the NFT, the contract, as well as its description and token ID.
00:35:40.458 - 00:36:14.690, Speaker F: But if I have NFTs that have a metadata field of Roblox Asset ID, I'm actually able to spawn them in Roblox. So for example, I can spawn this dog. I can push it around and interact with it and it can walk. I have another NFT, which is a car. So if I spawn that in, it'll load in and I can actually interact with it and drive it around. And I'm just going to wait for myself to respawn. Oh, looks like some of my friends joined.
00:36:14.690 - 00:36:26.006, Speaker F: And I can also spawn in this grappling hook and interact with it and shoot it around and it'll pull me, et cetera. And I also have this tower.
00:36:26.118 - 00:36:26.346, Speaker B: So.
00:36:26.368 - 00:36:52.066, Speaker F: I can actually have really big objects and stuff like that. I think one of the most important things about NFTs in the metaverse is you can have NFTs that actually do things, whereas regular NFTs might only just be a static image that doesn't do anything. NFTs in the metaverse can actually have functionality. I can get in this and goof around and stuff like that. So I'm going to exit Roblox for.
00:36:52.088 - 00:36:52.660, Speaker B: Now.
00:36:54.870 - 00:37:35.310, Speaker F: And I'm going to head over to my OpenSea page. And if you look at my OpenSea page, you can actually see some of the NFTs that I have. So I've got this dog, I've got this car, grappling hook, et cetera, and this tower. And if I just look at the metadata of one of these NFTs, the only thing it needs to support Roblox is this Roblox Asset ID field. And yeah, here's the dog. So I'm going to go back to my presentation. So what technologies behind Tis? So in order to make the Roblox framework, I needed to use roblox Studio Covalent is used to source the Web Three data.
00:37:35.310 - 00:38:15.040, Speaker F: So that's how I get the information for the NFTs, et cetera. An NFT port and IPFS are used to create new Web Three data so that's in order to create NFTs that are compatible with Roblox, et cetera and other metaverses. So in the future, I want to be able to support more metaverses rather than just one to actually bridge the gap. I think VRChat is a really promising next step, and I also want to be able to source data from multiple chains. So if you want to try out the Roblox demo yourself, if you have a Roblox account, you can head over to Tisdemo to try it out for yourself.
00:38:18.290 - 00:38:37.910, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much, Will. Just see everybody excited about this right now in the chat. And this is awesome. Not only is it just a cool demo, but it's also live. So you can try this out directly, and we'll paste the link for demo on the global TV chat, too. Congrats.
00:38:37.910 - 00:38:45.560, Speaker A: And next up, we have Patrick and Evan, who are going to talk about Vulture. So without further ado, let's welcome the next team.
00:38:47.550 - 00:39:07.530, Speaker B: Awesome. Hello, everybody. My name is Patrick and Evan's here. I'm from Bentonville, Arkansas. And I am from Rogers, Arkansas. And today we're going to demo Focher. Let me just give you a quick overview of what we made here for this hackathon.
00:39:07.530 - 00:39:32.998, Speaker B: Focher is a social marketplace that is built off of photos that you take with your smartphone camera. Everything on the app can also be remixed. Let's talk about that a little bit more. Here's an example of a photo that you might see on your feed in Focher taken with an iPhone or an Android camera. There's three different things that you can do with photos on your feed. You can either like them, pay a small gas fee to do that. You can purchase it for the price that the creator listed it for.
00:39:32.998 - 00:40:20.566, Speaker B: And you can remix or edit the creation and create something new and unique yourself. So if you were to create a remix, you could make something like this, for example, crop in, add a few stickers to it, create something brand new from it. And the symbiotic relationship between the parent and child is very apparent in our app. If you are viewing an edit, you can see the parent as inspiration. And if you're viewing parents, you can see all the edits that people have made from that photo. And if you come across my edit on your feed and you decide that you need to buy it and add it to your collection, the original parent will actually get a cut and a kickback from the sale. And this will be the first mobile app that supports Ethereum purchases for NFTs on mobile currently.
00:40:20.566 - 00:40:57.170, Speaker B: Evan, I'm going to kick it back to you for the demo here. All right? So as you can see here, I have our feed screen up. For the sake of time, I won't go through the process of photo never mind, sorry. But I will go through the process of doing a remix. So here you see this picture of a bet that I've made before. If I click this link in the top left of it, I'll come to our photo editor. Here we have different options, stickers, text and whatnot.
00:40:57.170 - 00:41:18.534, Speaker B: But for now, let's add a sticker. So add the sticker, click this button in the bottom right. It's saving the image. And what will come up is a modal to put in our information. So this will be the metadata for the NFT. So this is a remix. Call it remix.
00:41:18.534 - 00:41:58.790, Speaker B: Five description of remix. And then I get to choose a tag and I will say Art. I click save NFT. And what this is doing is it's uploading the image to IPFS, then it's uploading the metadata. Then it's going to take me to my preferred wallet to confirm the minting. So here I'm in Rainbow. If I confirm, do the Face ID and now I can go back into poultry.
00:41:58.790 - 00:42:31.440, Speaker B: So while that's going, let's go through another flow. This is unfortunate. I'm working with less Internet than I generally have due to the holidays in the US.
00:42:34.790 - 00:42:37.300, Speaker A: We can go a minute or so if it works.
00:42:44.490 - 00:43:05.500, Speaker B: It yeah, I'm not sure my bundler has enough juice to get it to there it is. We're back. Perfect. There we go. Yeah. All right. So now I'll just do something simple for now.
00:43:05.500 - 00:43:31.698, Speaker B: Right here we have the original image of the bed. This one is actually up for sale. So we'll go through that flow. If I hit buy, the price is 0.1 matic. We give you the approximate USD price and that will show up in Rainbow for me to confirm the transaction. The approximate price is a little over one cent.
00:43:31.698 - 00:44:01.110, Speaker B: I hit confirm. And again, that transaction is going through. I believe if I hit here, I can see that it's sent and then go back into folks. And now, Patrick, if you want to talk about any other future developments that we're trying to do. Absolutely. Yeah. In the future, we want to be able to support video and using our rich editor for handling video editing as well as photos.
00:44:01.110 - 00:44:29.700, Speaker B: We also are going to be supporting a faucet in the future as well to be able to support your first matic transactions in our app. We also have a full fledged camera here that we did not show as a part of this editor. But again, we hope to be the first iOS and Android app to support Ethereum NFT purchases for the mobile market. That is it for us. I think that's it. Yep, that's it for us.
00:44:30.250 - 00:44:43.334, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much and this was awesome. Murphy's Law is always a concern when doing live demos, but you pulled through this worked out. Everybody is excited about what you're doing and can't wait for this to go live on the App Store. Congrats.
00:44:43.382 - 00:44:45.100, Speaker B: Appreciate it. Kartik. Thank you very much.
00:44:45.710 - 00:45:06.130, Speaker A: All right, so with that, we are ready for our last four demos. So we're going to bring on Twitter, NFTs, Diffactor, and Seashells, and they're going to talk about what they built. And then after that, we'll get into all the prices. So without further ado, let's welcome Tweeter. We have Richard and Thomas.
00:45:12.550 - 00:45:38.540, Speaker B: Okie dokie. Hello, everyone. I hope you're having a great morning evening, wherever you are. We are Team Tweeter, and this is our project for the Web Three jam hackathon. Our team, we actually recently created a Dow. We are 404 Dow and are very proud to kind of get started working on these projects consisting of four friends who are formerly all from the same college, now spread out throughout the US. And these are our Telegram handles in case anyone wants to message us later.
00:45:38.540 - 00:46:26.266, Speaker B: So the goal for our project was to create a social layer for Ethereum because we think that with these wallet addresses that often are very long and not very beginner friendly and intimidating, plus they're hard to kind of be able to easily recognize other people's wallets just by name alone. Right. Because they're so long and complicated, we want to make it a little bit easier and create this social fabric for the Ethereum network. Our solution to that is Tweether, which is a completely decentralized Web Three site that lets you follow your favorite wallets. It streams live wallet transaction activities for your followed wallets, supports ENS and address lookup for convenience, and also includes NFTs as profile pictures for addresses that do contain them. So with that, let's hop into the demo. Here is our site, which is live at this link, and I'll have it later as well.
00:46:26.266 - 00:46:58.226, Speaker B: I've already connected my wallet, so we're going to go ahead and just click that and we're at our feed. Currently, all of the wallets that I'm following aren't actively trading and since this only shows live transaction data, nothing's populating yet. But let's show an example of us adding another address to follow. So I'm going to search up the ENS for Vitalik. We have his site here as well as his current balance and the ability to follow him. So we'll get Follow wait a little bit as that goes through. And if we go back to our page, we now see that we're actually following him and can click on his site and all those things.
00:46:58.226 - 00:47:33.150, Speaker B: Also notice that we have the NFTs here for those people who have them available. If we want to unfollow them, all we do is click on the card we're brought back to this simple card UI, hit unfollow and then we are no longer following Vitalik. But let's say we want to spice up our feed and actually see some things here. So I'm going to enter the address for a pretty hotly traded FTX wallet. These do take a little bit longer to load. So as this is loading, I'll kind of explain one of the main pieces of logic in our engineering flow. We use Ceramic backed by PFS to kind of store out this social graph of followers and followees.
00:47:33.150 - 00:47:45.714, Speaker B: And we actually don't use the Ceramic ID for this. What we use is deterministic queries where we kind of take someone's address and append a tag to it to allow us to represent that kind of follower network, which we think is a pretty.
00:47:45.912 - 00:47:48.034, Speaker A: Great way to keep this basically free.
00:47:48.072 - 00:48:22.382, Speaker B: To use and also pretty powerful. So here we have this wallet address. Now we're going to click Follow and now we're following this wallet as well. If we go back here, we can see it here. And if we go to our feed, we actually already see some transactions that they're making. So we see the sender, the receiver, the transaction hash, as well as the value, how many block confirmations it took, the transaction type and the gas price, plus the time it's already populating even more. But one cool thing is if you click on this, actually it'll take you to Etherscan so you can read more in depth information about what's actually going on.
00:48:22.382 - 00:48:58.010, Speaker B: So that's about it for a demo. Back to the slides. I'll kind of talk about how this whole thing works in our next steps, so how it's made. As I said, we use Ceramic, which is decentralized storage basically for our social graph via IPFS. ENS and NFT port are great additions to allow users to query easily for people's ENS instead of complicated addresses and also display NFT profile pictures for some added flair. Ethers JS allows us to provide the live feeds for those transactions for the followed addresses. Next, JS and React are the backbone for our UI framework and then for Cell is used for deployment.
00:48:58.010 - 00:49:34.280, Speaker B: Next steps for Tweeter specifically is we love to kind of build out this feed. It's a little annoying that you have to be following either a lot of wallets or wallets that trade a lot to see information. So we want to make it historical and searchable transactions available as well as reactions. We want to kind of build a social network a little bit here. Commenting, favoriting, emoting, all these things are really integral to social networks and we'd love to add those features to this decentralized protocol, basically. Additionally, we want to give people the ability to personalize their profiles if they want. So beyond just the NFTs that are in their wallets, adding other options as well.
00:49:34.280 - 00:50:23.590, Speaker B: Really though, we see this as more of kind of a demo for kind of what we want to build in the future. So the end goal really is to create an API that allows other DApps to integrate with our social graph. Kind of think about how like, Google, Facebook, Twitter, these sites allow login options for a bunch of third party sites. We think that something like this for the Web Three decentralized world would be really powerful and useful, especially because ours is free and decentralized. The way I think about it is like Tweeter is just a demo of that social graph in action. And to close, I'd just like to challenge you to think about a future where every DAP that you log into automatically knows the wallets you care about and automatically knows that network around you. And I think that can be a really powerful thing moving forward for all of us.
00:50:23.590 - 00:50:38.220, Speaker B: So with that, I want to thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day. Here's the link to our demo app if you want to try it out. And we actually just recently set up a Twitter within the discord, so feel free to follow us at 404 Dow for updates about this project and more to come. Thank you.
00:50:39.390 - 00:50:53.040, Speaker A: Thanks Richard. This is awesome. And hopefully we all get to use it soon in production. So congrats. And next up, we have Janice who's going to talk about NFTs. Whenever you're ready.
00:50:58.230 - 00:51:40.490, Speaker G: Hi, so I'm Janice, I'm from Paris and I will present you my project for this hackathon. My project is NFTs with a z. And so what is NFT? So who I am? First. I am Product Manager. I quit my job a few weeks ago to focus on building products on web three. And so a bit of context why I'm building NFTs and what is NFTs? So NFTs is a Figma plugin that enables designers to mint NFT directly from Figma. So, a bit of context, I saw that Adobe will empower their users with onchain solutions.
00:51:40.490 - 00:52:35.518, Speaker G: And also I'm a big fan of Figma, the most used product design software with 4 million users. So why? I'm building NFTs. So first, it's to onboard talented web two designers on web three. And I think that the easiest way is to go search for them on their preferred tool. Second reason is to create new opportunities for creators. I know that there is a lot of creators that are designing NFTs on Figma and I think it's a cool way for them to monetize their work. And also the long term idea is to enable designers to monetize design elements so create a new economy where they can sell by UI elements or an entire design system for example.
00:52:35.518 - 00:53:44.674, Speaker G: So let's start a quick demo. So here I'm on Figma and I created this nice design and so I will use my plugin. So first I can give a name to my NFT. So let's say web three jam NFT and a description, a super cool NFT minted from Figma and the ethereum address where I want to receive this NFT and so I can start meeting. So what the plugin is doing is first I will upload the image on IPFS using NFT storage API so I can check that my image is well stored on IPFS. And then I'm using NFT port to mint the NFT on Rinkib so we can check that the transaction is well made. So here is my image stored on IPFS design I made on Figma and so we will come back in a few seconds.
00:53:44.674 - 00:55:17.754, Speaker G: So about the product, so what is the product? So as you saw, it enables you to create NFTs but also you will be able to search for NFTs directly from Figma and also manage all your NFTs created. And so what's next for my project? So I hope to release the plugin in two weeks with the Minting available on Polygon and also I will work on store more metadata about the design. So for let users upload more metadata about their designs and also enable users to fetch on chain stored design elements to use them on their Figma designs. So we can check now that our transaction is well made. So this is our transaction, we've just minted our design and also we can check our OpenSea profile to make sure that the NFT is minted. He's here. And now I can sell directly my design on OpenSea.
00:55:17.754 - 00:55:47.070, Speaker G: So sorry my connection is a bit slow but we can see that the NFT is here and as you know you can sell it on OpenSea. I hope to see you soon on Sigma using NFTs with a Z. And thank you all for your attention.
00:55:48.610 - 00:56:08.600, Speaker A: Amazing, thank you so much. And this is incredible. Just mint NFTs directly from Figma, go straight to the source, can't be more excited. So can't wait to try this out in two weeks. Thank you so much. And with that we are ready for our next demo and I want to welcome the Die Factor team to come on and showcase what they built.
00:56:15.450 - 00:56:40.590, Speaker H: Hi everyone. So this is die factor. We are presenting our project for the web three jam hackathon for ETH Global. So we are a team of three. Antoine is our blockchain developer. He took care and full stack developer. He took care of the API endpoint connections and wasim took care of the UIUX and the front end development.
00:56:40.590 - 00:57:08.120, Speaker H: Salome, our project manager, took care of building the roadmap for Diffactor, prioritizing the development features. We all work for Blockchain partner by KPMG, which is a French leading company in the blockchain consulting market. So the idea is to I don't know oh, sharing string is not working anymore. So I'll share. I'm sorry.
00:57:09.770 - 00:57:11.082, Speaker A: Everything is good now.
00:57:11.216 - 00:57:43.374, Speaker H: Okay, great. So here's the team. So I presented it. So now for the idea. It is to generate your wallet score based on your past activities to access advantages and bonuses in decentralized protocols. The use case is to generate your score based on your wallet activity using some API endpoints and data. Analyze the activity score and compute this score based on some criteria and mint an NFT score to access these advantages on other platforms.
00:57:43.374 - 00:58:04.406, Speaker H: So, here's the demo. This is the de facto landing page. We connect our wallet. I already have a wallet connected. Now the score is computing. This is my score, which is based on some criteria. I'm going to change my wallet to see that I have some other details.
00:58:04.406 - 00:58:52.326, Speaker H: For the other address, we chose some criteria arbitrarily. So for now, we have six criteria the cumulative balance, NFT holdings, token holdings, Scam tokens and these criteria are used to compute the score. We have some bonus scoring criteria based on some specific protocols, like having an ENS or having NFTs on the Zapperverse. So now I'm going to mint the score on Rinkbee. So while it is minting, I'm going to explain all this. Data is taken from Covalent API and ENS API and then computed on the front end side. This core minting happens using NFT port and it is made on Rinkabee.
00:58:52.326 - 00:59:29.622, Speaker H: So now we have our NFT. We can check it on Azerscan for Rinkabee. We can have the details that are stored on IPFS. The score and all the details for the scoring are all on IPFS. We've made an integration screen that we couldn't finish. But the idea is to make that scoring protocol accessible from other platforms. The ideal would be to have an integration button that would give access to some limited content, maybe an article or something.
00:59:29.622 - 01:00:28.226, Speaker H: We could imagine memberships on unlock or better lending rates for Ave or an AirDrop system management using this score. So now we get back to what's under the hood. So we've used covalent API. We've used the ENS API to check if the address has ENS. IPFS has been used to store the metadata and NFT port for the NFT contract deployment and the NFT minting on the front end. The next steps would be to go mainnet make the integration thing that we mentioned with unlock. Make a library for integrations for this very button and then write the integration docs to make it accessible from other platforms and then build a dow to enhance the criteria and make the criteria selection decentralized.
01:00:28.226 - 01:00:40.890, Speaker H: The other thing that we didn't mention on this slide would be to add the details of the scoring. So thank you for listening to us. Hope you liked our project and bye bye.
01:00:42.770 - 01:00:49.598, Speaker A: Thank you so much. That was an incredible demo and congrats on making this work.
01:00:49.764 - 01:00:50.480, Speaker H: Thanks.
01:00:52.290 - 01:01:05.060, Speaker A: So, yeah, hopefully we get to see this on Mainet soon. And with that, we are ready for our last demo of the day. So, without further ado, let's welcome our last team and that's Sahaj, who's going to talk about Seashells. Whenever you're ready.
01:01:11.570 - 01:01:12.494, Speaker B: Hello, everyone.
01:01:12.612 - 01:02:02.350, Speaker I: So there has been this meme if, you know, going around which goes like, I'm going to right click your NFT and that basically mocks the nature of NFTs just being an image and how it can be saved. Now we know it's much more than that and recently a lot of games have started to emerge in the space around those NFDS and trying to put these in interactive spaces. Sometimes it's 2D NFTs in the gallery, but the NFD is still an image there and 2D image in a 3D environment. And just sometimes it's in an interactive NFD space or a full 3D NFD. So this experiment is to promote those kinds of usages in games. So if you're interested in those or are developing games, then you'll find some interesting things in this presentation and project. I'm Serge and this is Seashells.
01:02:02.350 - 01:03:12.530, Speaker I: Seashells, it's made on top of Lobstergao NFDS, which are 2D NFDS on a fixed layout. It contains some different characters and some different properties. So the idea behind Seashells is it's a visualizer, and the idea is to wrap these 2D NFTs in a 3D interactive environment and put these in a game engine, which then enables a lot of possibilities for the visual part. They have been UV unwrapped and for collections following fixed layout, if we just do it for different characters, rest just lines up properly with this. We also want our metadata in games to do interesting things and maybe some extra properties. So here we showcase use of IPFS as database or Immutable systems in games to define character properties, objects or part of logic, et cetera. And a few different NFT APIs based mocs with Unity 3d So, within Lobster we have a rankings sheet created by Michael, one of the lobsters.
01:03:12.530 - 01:03:51.140, Speaker I: And this sheet not only contains all the metadata, but it also contains a lot of extra numbers based on rankings. And we can use this very creatively in our games. So this sheet has been hosted over IPFS. Now, what this has done is it has made this sheet immutable and every time we need to define a character or properties, we refer to this sheet. And in this sense, we can use kind of similar approach to create more complex systems and games. So it's live at Seashells embracing Earth space. And let's jump right in.
01:03:51.140 - 01:05:21.330, Speaker I: So here we are in the space and we can put in any of the numbers from our collection. So what this has done, it has read our IPFS database, it fetches the image also from IPFS. Each time it assigns the model accordingly, it wraps it onto an image and it assigns other character properties accordingly, which can be seen on the right and left sides of the screen once it loads. So from here on, we have all our metadata, image, everything wrapped in a 3D interactive environment, and it can be used in games or just have fun in interactive environment. So alongside this, within Unity 3D, we have examples of NFT port, covalent and openc API to get all NFT data in Unity, which can be used to get more dynamic and live data. And here we have all the attributes, backgrounds, images, et cetera. And from there on, it was the visualizer which you saw.
01:05:21.330 - 01:05:39.000, Speaker I: So I think all these tech together, NFT with their metadata and interactive real time environments has great potential to be expanded on. And we know this is like a lot of the next upcoming trend which is coming in the space. That's my presentation. Thank you.
01:05:40.090 - 01:06:03.440, Speaker A: Thank you so much. That was an awesome demo to see, especially when you made it work live with pulling in the data directly. I can't wait for more of these to come on. And yeah, hopefully we get to use more NFTs and get them from two D to three D. Congrats. All right, so that was our 10th demo and our 10th finalist. I just went live.
01:06:03.440 - 01:06:43.514, Speaker A: This makes all the demos we want to show today to all of you. So I want to congratulate all these ten teams one more time. It's Tweeter 3ft die factors, seashells, crypto, murals, tis, NFTs, Focher ENS me and backer. The one thing that's kind of super interesting to me and I want to point out is that all these things have very two similar properties in common. The first is they're all in a position to be live and be used by everybody very soon, whether it's main, net or testnet currently. And they're all targeting mass adoption of Web three and crypto. And this is something that gets me excited every time because it hadn't been in this space for so long.
01:06:43.514 - 01:07:47.566, Speaker A: And seeing how we make progress from a developer and a product standpoint, seeing the outcomes here for web three gem brings me a lot of joy. So I can't wait to try all of these products out in a couple of weeks. And with that, we are ready for even more good stuff. And that is all the prizes that all of you have been waiting for. So I want to quickly thank all of our partners here for this event who are IPFS Filecoin, Lackpier Ethereum Foundation Ceramic Fluence NFT Port Unlock Protocol, ENS Covalent Gelato and Grant Style.

So thank you to all of our speakers and all the amazing partners that were doing all the work behind the scenes to make sure that the event is a success for all of you here. Whether that's being able to help you with the SDK integrations or bugs, or helping you come up with a good idea, or giving you feedback for the feedback sessions, all these amazing people were there to make sure that you all succeed. And of course, I want to thank some of our volunteers who were here doing the work behind the scenes to make sure that everything runs smoothly. Whether it's this call or the judging sessions or any of the asynchronous things that you all have experienced in making this event more global. Without the work they've been doing, you would not have a smooth experience. So I want to thank all of them here as well.

And if you've been part of any mobile event before, you know that we don't have Innocence of first, 2nd, 3rd. We don't want this thing to be a competition.

01:14:39.160 - 01:15:33.458, Speaker A: So before we go, I want to do a quick 62nd note on how this year has been for ETH Global. As you kind of mentioned me saying this is our last segment of the year. We will be continuing a lot more things in 2022 and I can't wait to tell all of you about what's happening over the next few months and all of next year from our side. But before we kind of close off today's livestream, I want to quickly give everybody how this year went from the global side. We started off and we finished off this year by running nine hackathons and 18 Summits. This is definitely the most amount of things we've done in a given year and we were thrilled to be able to not only do this stuff, but also invite so many incredible people throughout these events. We hosted over 5700 hackers just this year alone who contributed over 1337 projects.
01:15:33.458 - 01:16:35.638, Speaker A: We gave away over one and a half million dollars in prizes and hosted more than 450 talks, workshops, interviews and discussions. And when we pulled the numbers last night together, it blew our mind on the reach here. So I'm still shocked by the incredible amount of people that are excited about Web Three because everything that came out of E Global this year has gone over 360,000 eyes of just all the people watching the talks and interviews and workshops. We had over 65,000 people come and tune in on the summit content and over 50,000 hours worth of talks has been watched collectively from all these people who we've hosted from 117 different countries spanning 21 different time zones. So I am blown away by how global this community actually is and I couldn't be more excited to continue doing more things for everybody here as a team. Next year and years to come. So thank you so much to everybody who was part of all of our events.
01:16:35.638 - 01:17:13.286, Speaker A: Whether it's on the live stream or as a participant or as a speaker or as a judge or as a sponsor or as a mentor, you all made this happen and you got thousands more people excited about everything that's happening in this space. So, sincerely, thank you so much for being part of the global community and I can't wait to see all of you again next year. And with that, I want to sign off on web three gem and we'll see you all in 2022. Thanks, everybody. Hope you have a great rest of the week and Happy Thanksgiving to those who are celebrating. Continue back very soon and you'll see what's next in the next few weeks. Signing off.
01:17:13.286 - 01:17:17.570, Speaker A: Congratulations again. Bye.
