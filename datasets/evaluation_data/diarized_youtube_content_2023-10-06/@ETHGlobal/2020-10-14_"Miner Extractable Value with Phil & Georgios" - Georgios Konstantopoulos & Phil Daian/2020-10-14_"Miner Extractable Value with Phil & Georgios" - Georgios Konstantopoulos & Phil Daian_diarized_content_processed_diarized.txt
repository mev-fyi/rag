00:00:01.930 - 00:00:22.160, Speaker A: Hello everyone. My name is Georges. I work with Paradigm and I'm here to talk with Phil Diane who will introduce himself really shortly about Minned acceptable value a topic which I believe we will hear more and more about in Ethereum. So Phil, would you want to introduce yourself and we can get into it?
00:00:22.770 - 00:01:23.526, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm Phil. I'm a PhD student at Cornell University. I work on smart contract security and distributed system security in general particularly, I'm interested in systems currently that have sort of economic forms of security as well as traditional sort of computational based notions of security or even that blend the two. And part of this interest has been in the past in Ethereum and in DEXes on Ethereum and many, many other projects on Ethereum that I've studied or helped with in various capacities. And I guess today we're talking about mev, which I first encountered in my work on DEXes in 2017 kind of time period and kind of coined the term as a way to describe this implicit fee that we saw as potentially changing the game theoretic kind of consensus economic game between miners on Ethereum. So, yeah, that's my backstory in a nutshell, I guess.
00:01:23.708 - 00:01:24.054, Speaker A: Nice.
00:01:24.092 - 00:01:24.294, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:24.332 - 00:01:47.642, Speaker A: And somebody that reads about the Flash Boys 2.0 paper might say that you and your authors on that paper are kind of like the fathers of Mev. So it's very exciting. So would you be able to give us a succinct definition of mev and give us some intuition on why it can be dangerous for Ethereum or destabilizing to some extent?
00:01:47.786 - 00:02:10.326, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So in a nutshell, mev is basically the profit or the value. It stands for minor extractable value. So it's the value that a miner is able. The able is very important. It doesn't matter whether it actually happens or not to extract from the Ethereum network when they create a block. So mev kind of as a whole comes from several different places in the lucist form.
00:02:10.326 - 00:02:58.950, Speaker B: One of them is the block reward and the other one is transaction fees. Those are both kind of extensively studied in the past as sources of fees for cryptocurrency. But there's two other sources that I think are very interesting and that apply specifically to smart contract platforms like Ethereum. One of them is transaction reordering. So changing the order in which things happen on the network either to prefer kind of certain users transactions over others or assign certain profits to certain trading bots over others or whatever the case might be. Or even for miners to insert their own transactions that actively interfere with or take advantage of or use depending on what the nature of the transactions is, these systems. So it kind of looks at the value with all the degrees of freedom a miner has in the protocol that a miner can use to increase their ETH balance in one Ethereum block or across a range of Ethereum blocks.
00:02:58.950 - 00:03:42.370, Speaker B: Why is this destabilizing? Well, the simplest intuition is imagine if there's almost no mev from reordering in the system and then one block comes along where suddenly it's really profitable to control the order of that block. Let's say Ampleforth has just rebased and created a massive arbitrage opportunity on decentralized exchanges or something like that. So in this one block, it may be hundreds or thousands of times more valuable in terms of mev than the block that came before it. So now the next miner that comes along has a choice of which block to mine on. Do they kind of ignore this block that just extracted all this mev and try to take that mev for themselves? Or do they extend it like they're supposed to in the honest blockchain protocol and just kind of go for fees and block reward?
00:03:43.510 - 00:03:48.530, Speaker A: And typically you call this time banded attack in your papers, if I'm not mistaken.
00:03:48.690 - 00:04:06.490, Speaker B: Yes. So time banded attacks specifically are also you can do this over multiple blocks, so you can do an even longer 51% attack. That's a great point. I will tie that in. But yeah, basically this makes consensus extremely can you still hear me? Sorry.
00:04:06.560 - 00:04:07.180, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:07.710 - 00:04:29.426, Speaker B: Makes consensus potentially unstable. One important thing to note about time banded attacks is because it's hard to figure out the mev in a block, it becomes more profitable. The more transactions you have access to, the more reorderings you can do. And so it's actually like super linear in time, basically the number of profits you can make from a time banded attack, which I think is a super interesting point.
00:04:29.608 - 00:04:57.290, Speaker A: So a time banded attack can happen only in a chain that has reorganizations, kind of in a Nakamoto like consensus where you can choose to build on the latest block or you can start a new fork from the task. So is it the case that mev is less of an issue in a chain, such as something that's built on Cosmos or Tendermint, where they use a Byzantine fault tolerant consensus with no forking?
00:04:58.670 - 00:05:07.840, Speaker B: Yeah. I think this is an interesting conversation, especially with you, Georgios, and I'd love to hear your thoughts here because you're a POS and an l two kind of guy.
00:05:08.370 - 00:05:09.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:09.412 - 00:05:41.502, Speaker B: In some way. Yeah. Let me challenge you a little bit and then I'll throw it to you. I would say that the high level answer and the one that's in the Flash Boys paper, if you read like the last last section, is that maybe long term reorgs are going to be harder. So you won't see huge like 51% style attacks because of finality, because it's kind of hard to reorg past this finality checkpoint. And the real fundamental reason for that is just almost a social contract of the community. Like if you reorg past finality, the community won't consider that valid.
00:05:41.502 - 00:06:17.442, Speaker B: Even if the software says it's valid, I think people will reject that. And there's other incentives to sort of prevent that from happening. On the other hand, I think those incentives also kind of are subtly there in proof of work chains too. Like if someone came along with 100 block time banded attack on Bitcoin, it's not clear whether people would accept what the client says and say yes, this is the most proof of work. Or will they say like no, obviously this was mined retroactively and it's a malicious thing. So I think a big part of it is the social contract of the community. Like POS kind of formalizes that a little bit more and maybe gives you this distinct boundary past which time bandit attacks are hard.
00:06:17.442 - 00:06:48.254, Speaker B: I still think they're an issue for kind of the interim process of how you actually decide on that finalized checkpoint and that order. There's all sorts of issues there that can be discussed. But yeah, I would posit to you and I would love to hear your take on this, that really they're kind of equivalent in that in both you could possibly have this long term economic incentive. But in both proof of work and proof of stake, there's like some reorg point past which the community will just be like no. And in proof of stake it's a little bit more explicit because there's this finality discrete notion, right?
00:06:48.292 - 00:07:43.614, Speaker A: So I think I can push back on this. So firstly, I think that we have a disconnect in the sense that there's the BFT proof of stake flavor, which is what Tendermint does, and there's whatever we call it proof of stake that ethereum does. So the ethereum two will do. So the proof of stake that ethereum will do, it takes about twelve to 18 minutes to reach finality for a transaction. And that's because you need to get two epochs to finalize to justify, which means that in that period, indeed you can have some short reords and indeed the time banded attack can still happen. But in Tendermint, once a block has been signed on by all the validators, it's no longer possible to create a valid block in the past, it will get ejected by the clients that are synced to the chain. So, I think that you do not have time bandit attacks in Turner mint flavored versions.
00:07:43.614 - 00:08:40.820, Speaker A: However, there still can be mev until you reach consensus on the next block. So, for example, while we're still gossiping our pre commits and our commits for the next BFT round, maybe a minor validator comes in and says exclude this transaction because it will give you more because I will bribe you for whatever amount and then it allows you to destabilize that. So potentially what I think that it could cause is that instead of reaching consensus in 5 seconds, maybe it takes you eight or 9 seconds to do that. So it's more like a performance deterioration rather than an actual destabilizer to the extent that it created security. So, moving forward from this, how big do you think that the mev market is how much mev exists and is it bigger than the transaction fee market will it be?
00:08:41.590 - 00:09:30.478, Speaker B: Yeah, so I wish I had a better answer to that question. I mean, we lower bounded it in Flashboys 2.0, but that was a very conservative lower bound where we only looked at one type of transaction on one type of decks. There's a few different ways to answer this question. You can go for just looking at what people are extracting and I think a decent proxy for that is the transaction fee market. I think the mev market is somewhat linearly correlated to the transaction fee market, maybe a little bit more than the transaction fee market in terms of what bots are actually exploiting. But the actual mev that's available to be exploited by bots is much harder to study because you have to basically ask yourself what is the optimal order of transactions a miner can do in this next block to profit? And that's a really hard computer science problem, pretty much intractable.
00:09:30.478 - 00:09:51.482, Speaker B: So it would include all hacks and all ARBs and things like that. So I would expect the mev market in reality, like the real deal, if you measured it that way, what you would see is approximately the size of the DeFi security market, which is probably like one order of magnitude. And this is just me BSing. My intuition here kind of smaller than the DeFi market.
00:09:51.536 - 00:10:13.182, Speaker A: We love your intuition, Phil. If we hear your intuition, that's great. So do you think that there would be formal methods, for example, to find all the available mev inside the block or even kind of calculate the optimal permutation of transactions so that we can pull from the mempool to maximize the mev 100%?
00:10:13.236 - 00:10:49.210, Speaker B: I do, and I would say stay tuned on that front. I'm definitely planning on publishing some work related to this and I'm sure I'm not the only person in computer science who's going to do that. So yeah, I think we'll definitely see all sorts of formal techniques. I hope there will be a nice space of competition here. I think formal verification historically has been very murky. The incentives to actually do it because it's expensive and hard and the value is not immediately visible up front a lot of the times. So I hope this will actually be like a nice playground for those techniques to become profitable and maybe even be able to fund their own development eventually.
00:10:49.950 - 00:11:13.490, Speaker A: Fantastic. So we will all be looking forward to that. So far, how does the mev market, in your opinion, differ in Ethereum rather than in Bitcoin? Is it that due to the composability available in Ethereum that its mev market will always be larger than Bitcoin?
00:11:16.070 - 00:11:50.826, Speaker B: Yeah, it's hard to know. I mean, Bitcoin has some forms of mev because the market is larger. Like it's obviously profitable if you're a, let's say, large market maker on coinbase and you know, the addresses of your competition. And you can bribe miners, say, to even delay them by a block with some probability. That might be a worthwhile thing for you to do because in terms of market shocks and market events, you might be able to move a little bit faster and have longer term, like a more profitable equilibrium than they do. So I think it exists in bitcoin. It's much more second order and therefore harder to quantify.
00:11:50.826 - 00:12:01.380, Speaker B: And it depends on the real economics of bitcoin in a way that I think by design we'll never be able to know or measure unless maybe we see some attacks come out down the line.
00:12:02.310 - 00:12:11.634, Speaker A: Does layer two increase mev? For example? Lightning creates a lot more opportunities to censor a transaction or reorder transaction.
00:12:11.762 - 00:12:40.720, Speaker B: That's a great point. Yeah, I think layer two hugely increases mev. And I think that's one of the things the lightning skeptics early on in bitcoin pointed out, that, look, you're moving all your security to another layer, but the miners incentives kind of change when you do that. And I think that was a poorly articulated case back then. But yeah, I think we can probably formally calculate how much. And my guess is, if lightning is the scaling future of bitcoin, that will probably be substantial. So that is a great point.
00:12:41.730 - 00:13:00.070, Speaker A: How does smart contract composability relate to mev? And I imagine that a lot of our audience will be protocol or smart contract developers. So how would you recommend to them to design their software to minimize mev? What are some best practices?
00:13:01.290 - 00:13:53.190, Speaker B: Yeah, those are both great questions. So I'll take the best practices one first because I think it's a little bit easier and more poorly defined. So I think the best practices for mev right now is just to write an economic spec of what you're building and kind of try to reason through the mev and put it out there with your protocol in those. Early stages of having the white paper make it part of the design and part of the awareness of this whole process so that you are thinking about it and that you're showing people that you're thinking about it and that you get feedback from people when they're mev vectors that maybe you haven't thought of. I think soon we're going to see some more formal toolkits that will help people and I hope things will become easier, but I think that's one really good way in the future. The other question is how mev relates to security and composability. I think they're all kind of the same thing.
00:13:53.190 - 00:14:45.910, Speaker B: So in some ways, the miner is the most powerful permissionless enemy of your protocol. If you're designing a protocol, they can simulate any other cartel, any other set of people on the network, they can reorder transactions, they can censor, they can insert. So they're like strictly more powerful than anyone else on the network with your protocol. So the mev to me is kind of like a lower bound for your security and kind of speaks to in which sets and which cases miners kind of can or can't extract value from strategies in your protocol. So I think while you're doing your security analysis, mev will naturally kind of fall out. And the last thing composability. So I'm hoping that we're going to release a paper on this soon out of Cornell, but to give you a sneak peek, and you can probably look at my Twitter for some other sneak peeks.
00:14:45.910 - 00:15:23.074, Speaker B: I think composability is also in some ways a function of mev. So composability is in some ways saying when I deploy my contract, the mev of the world is not going to increase that's basically saying that your contract will compose with everything that's out there because it won't substantially increase the degrees of freedom in either attacking other protocols or in taking money out of your protocol. So I think that's one way to reason about security. And I hope that we have a lot more information on that soon and a lot more kind of formal modeling. I know we will have a lot more of that soon. So yeah, really looking forward to that.
00:15:23.272 - 00:16:03.358, Speaker A: You have us all very excited about this. So while we call it mev, it has actually not been used as mev so far. It has been more like front runner extractable value because all the liquidator bots are just bidding up and doing all these priority gas auctions in the timescale of one block. So have there been any real examples of miners reordering transactions to pocket mev or inserting their transactions at the very top of the mempool of the block? Or has it just been or are miners still not awake to this?
00:16:03.524 - 00:16:28.258, Speaker B: Yeah, so I've been talking to a lot of pools and reading about a lot of pools recently. So I've got my pools a little bit jumbled. I forgot if it was F two pool or spark pool. And I don't want to say the wrong guys. I think it was F two pool, but I just want to make sure that I'm not saying the wrong thing. But I think they were the earliest instance of when I saw this a while back. There's a FC paper on this about it's a front running sok.
00:16:28.258 - 00:17:19.286, Speaker B: So if you Google like front running space, sok space FC, you'll find this paper, I think it's by Jeremy Clark is on there along with a few other people and they talk about how F two pool basically front ran an ICO. And in some ways that was one of the early forms of mev in 2017 was like, if I can get into this ICO pump and then dump it on the people a little bit later in the pump, that's a form of mev in some way. And they did do that. I think more recently people have been DMing me a bunch of examples of pools that are doing Arbitrage transactions that aren't ordered by gas and that are, let's say, preferring certain bots and doing things like that. So I think those trust based networks are currently being built and I think we're going to see more and more of to if anyone cares to see.
00:17:19.308 - 00:18:10.700, Speaker A: It and shout out on what you said. Last week, an anonymous Twitter account called Frank Researcher, who always puts out amazing research out of nowhere on Twitter, put out actually a case study of this where he found out, he or she found out that actually some miners were inserting low gas transactions on top of the block. And it was interesting because it is kind of like you can tell that there is something fishy happening here. Phil, what is the difference between front running and back running? And I think most of our audience possibly knows what front running is, but it would be helpful to get a full definition of both. What are the differences and how are they impacting things in different way?
00:18:11.870 - 00:18:47.782, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's a good question. Front running, classically is a really old term. It deals with when people were trading on paper and people would kind of write orders and walk them across the room. And when you saw your competition kind of the fat guy was walking an order pad at 2 mph, you could go run in front of him and you knew this guy was probably buying based on the news you just saw. So you just basically sandwich someone and you take the best orders in the order book before they can or execute the best trade before they can. Then they come in after. You kind of get whatever is left in the market and then you go and sell back.
00:18:47.782 - 00:19:12.458, Speaker B: At now the higher rate of the market conditions they've created by buying. So you basically make a guaranteed profit, just almost guaranteed by wrapping this person's order in Ethereum, this profit kind of is guaranteed because you can do these atomic smart contract transactions where you do the sandwiching and you kind of just throw the whole transaction. So in some ways it's a little bit easier to analyze than even traditional front running.
00:19:12.624 - 00:19:20.890, Speaker A: And when you say sandwiching, you mean you insert the transaction before somebody does something, what they do happens and then you do another transaction.
00:19:21.050 - 00:19:44.034, Speaker B: Typically that's what front running would look like. And sandwiching is the particular term. Front running just refers to wanting to be there before them. Sandwiching is kind of a case of that where immediately after you also kind of liquidate or you get out. Yeah, exactly. You're trying to piggyback on them or whatever you're trying to do. It's also very common in high frequency trading.
00:19:44.034 - 00:20:20.206, Speaker B: Like when people place large orders on Robinhood or something, they're routed through companies that have more direct lines to the exchange. So they kind of triangulate you out and place a little order right before yours because they know your order is going to come in now and they know they can sell to you basically. So yeah, this is classically. It could either refer to being in front or very often to sandwiching. Back. Running is kind of a more crypto specific phenomenon, although I would argue it's also kind of a subset of this same kind of behavior and it refers to kind of getting in right after someone. So let's say after an Oracle update.
00:20:20.318 - 00:20:21.620, Speaker A: How do you do that?
00:20:22.070 - 00:20:33.960, Speaker B: Usually by spamming at a slightly lower gas price than they would put. So if they're going to do 25, you try to spam a lot of like 25 minus one guay transactions. And if miners sort by gas price, you hope.
00:20:34.410 - 00:20:45.820, Speaker A: And what is the effect of these actions? So these are kind of actions that do not have a net benefit to the ethereum ecosystem, yet they have some kind of effect on gas prices. So could you expand on that?
00:20:46.270 - 00:21:34.614, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's hard to measure their effect. I mean, for sure they're paying a lot of gas and for sure they're putting a lot of transactions in that are raising the gas price and leading to this congestion. We've also seen bots that engage in bidding wars when there's just not enough throughput on the whole chain to handle everyone's kind of events that need to happen. So in general, they definitely drive these spikes that we've seen. They also cause a lot of negative externalities on the P to P network. So like if you're just running a full node, many of these PGA transactions that we talk about in Flashboys and even some of these back runnings and other kinds of spams, the front running that we see, a lot of this stuff never even makes it to the blockchain. So like you have nodes that process maybe 100 or 200 transactions for the one transaction that ends up getting mined.
00:21:34.614 - 00:21:53.700, Speaker B: And miners don't care about that because they get the revenue and they kind of pay the cost once. But if you're just running a node, you're not making that revenue. You're doing this out of your pocket for whatever business reason you have. And in some ways this is a tragedy of the commons that's like these people's bandwidth are what's being used to play these games on the network right now.
00:21:54.070 - 00:22:22.300, Speaker A: Right. So Phil, currently how do you think that the liquidator software or the keypad software operators will evolve over time? Will it be like how mining got commoditized and it's now only big players in the game? So will there only be big player liquidators or will there be some more like an HFT kind of situation or will there be more hobbies around in the future?
00:22:24.590 - 00:23:13.900, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a great question. I don't know. I think either future is in the cone of possibilities right now. I would hope that it's not a few big players but I think the economics are set up to promote that in the same way that a lot of market economics promote a lot of big players just because expertise will kind of naturally concentrate in a few places. And this is going to be a very kind of tight margin, very competitive kind of ecosystem. So I think there is definitely a realm of possibility here that you get a few actors who gain outsized influence on Ethereum through this. And I think as a community how to prevent this is like a conversation that we need to have moving forward on the social side of the ecosystem and also the R and D side.
00:23:13.900 - 00:23:20.550, Speaker B: So I don't know, I hope it'll be a lot of small players but I think the economics are set up in the other direction.
00:23:20.630 - 00:23:32.110, Speaker A: I personally think what kinds of mev exist? Is there benign mev? Is there good mev or is there only bad mev or both or neutral? Can you give us some flavors?
00:23:32.610 - 00:24:14.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I would imagine there's good mev, for example. This is the same question, I think about general trading activity on Wall Street and in general. There's a lot of parallels here, a lot of lessons to be learned, like when is HFT and are these things parasitic and rent seeking versus when are they beneficial? It's a very hot debate. Some people would say they're always beneficial because in some ways they are part of the security model of the network and they should just be maximally exploited. And users want to do this, so we should enable this in as little damaging way as possible. But still it is what it is. Other people would say there's some mev that's more obviously benign.
00:24:14.922 - 00:24:56.650, Speaker B: Like for example, providing liquidity providers the ability to respond to news and move their tokens around inside uniswap contracts could be one example of this. Or another example could be matching orders on Ether delta, making that market more efficient and arbing some centralized exchange, bringing that liquidity into the blockchain. That could be fine if it's done at a reasonable liquidity provider premium that the user is aware of and okay, with no problem. You could on the other end have these hacks like the BZX attack or something like that, where a bunch of people just lose their shirts and that's also mev. And everything in between I think also exists.
00:24:57.070 - 00:25:21.940, Speaker A: How do you feel about unified approaches towards mev extraction such as the one taken by Keeper Dao? Just using saying that if you try to outbid me, I will bid as high as possible so that it's not profitable for anyone. So this creates a kind of a new equilibrium where maybe it is better for everybody to collaborate instead of collude. Do you think that that approach has a future?
00:25:23.190 - 00:26:12.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think approaches like that are kind of going to have to I think it's interesting that kind of equilibrium is one we talked about a lot in Flashboys, and I think it originally developed out of an interest of these trading bots that are exploiting the Mev to basically cheat miners and keep prices as low as possible amongst themselves. And then they were enforcing that cooperation. And if you break that, then they kind of make it unprofitable and that could be a way to kind of socialize profits a little bit more efficiently and keep them off of the miners table. I think we're going to see that mechanism in a lot of different places or something like it. It's kind of a natural thing to evolve. Maybe one place could be in preventing time banded attacks. So like intentionally leaving money on the table for other miners or having some sort of intentional transparent cartel that's like a good cartel.
00:26:12.814 - 00:26:14.254, Speaker B: I don't know if that's such a thing exists.
00:26:14.302 - 00:26:14.914, Speaker A: Got it.
00:26:15.032 - 00:26:15.698, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:15.864 - 00:26:51.120, Speaker A: A counterintuitive question as we're slowly running on time, is, is it possible for mev can be good for chain security? And this is more like a thought experiment, so let me lay that out. So in the absence of the block reward, you are relying only on transaction fees to align miner incentives. But what mev is, is more revenue going to miners from non block reward sources? Is it possible that you could fund miners with mev to have a chain without Isham's work?
00:26:52.770 - 00:27:13.846, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's an interesting open question. When I originally talked to Vitalik about mev was when the original infamous uniswap x times Y equals K post went on e three search and I emailed a bunch of people and I was horrified. I was like, what is this? This is terrible for users because all these ARBs exist and the system is not very efficient. So they're going to get arbed it.
00:27:13.868 - 00:27:14.786, Speaker A: Should not a bug.
00:27:14.898 - 00:27:45.650, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And the response I got from at the time at least, was maybe this will be the future block subsidy instead of transaction rewards when they decay to zero. And yes, that is an argument. I think there is some possibility that we will see that equilibrium. I think it depends on what the mev actually looks like. So if you have this very burst like mev, I think it's much more unlikely because systems in general don't like shocks. They don't like these crazy things that break the norm and suddenly change all the incentives.
00:27:45.650 - 00:28:03.590, Speaker B: My worry is that mev looks more like that. On the other hand, if mev kind of becomes this predictable thing we know how to deal with, maybe we can reach that kind of a future and it could be a benign thing and instead of leading to instability, it could actually be a mechanism for stability. So I think the jury is still.
00:28:03.660 - 00:28:05.506, Speaker A: Harnessing the power of chaos.
00:28:05.698 - 00:28:06.966, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah.
00:28:07.068 - 00:28:22.800, Speaker A: Fantastic. So I have a final question for you, Phil, and this comes from our audience. Do you think that mev and. The EIP One Five Nine, an upcoming proposal for changing the block space market for Ethereum have any relationship.
00:28:23.730 - 00:28:36.322, Speaker B: So I think we both kind of agree here that they don't have a direct relationship at all. Like the EIP 1559 still allows you to give a tip, aka a bribe, aka extra gas that still lets you.
00:28:36.376 - 00:28:51.282, Speaker A: Which depends on transaction. A few from the first principles approach. Mev comes from transaction ordering. The AIP does not affect transaction ordering, so they should be unrelated.
00:28:51.426 - 00:29:04.540, Speaker B: Yes, I agree, there might be some edge case interactions, like the fact that Spam now has to burn more gas because of the way it's charged with the minimum, or weird things like that at the edges, but in the core, I don't really see a fundamental difference.
00:29:05.070 - 00:29:10.106, Speaker A: Fantastic. Phil, I think we are at time. Can somebody confirm that we are at time?
00:29:10.208 - 00:29:11.082, Speaker B: I think so too.
00:29:11.136 - 00:29:13.210, Speaker D: Yes, we are at time indeed.
00:29:13.290 - 00:29:15.486, Speaker A: Fantastic. Thank you.
00:29:15.508 - 00:29:38.450, Speaker D: So on hold on, because I am going to bring Kartik up because there are a couple of extra questions from the audience. You guys have just it's been firing with all of the questions, so hang tight. I'm going to say goodbye. Kartik, step in and I'll see you all soon, hopefully.
00:29:38.610 - 00:30:13.498, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Simona and Georges and Phil, thanks so much for a great talk. I do have a good camera set up for this event, so thanks for noticing. So we have a lot of questions coming from the chat and for those of you who are joining us now, you can just go to Live Ethonline.org and just see all the questions from the audience on the chat. And what I'll do is I'll ask a couple of questions now to you both and if you have time, Georges and Phil, you can just go to Live ETH online and just kind of answer the questions directly in chat for any follow ups. A lot of them are kind of small clarifications.
00:30:13.498 - 00:30:29.000, Speaker C: So I'll just kind of ask a small one, which is in one of your comments, Georgia, you said something and one of our attendees would like a clarification, and that is, can you clarify the difference between each two? Finality and BFT? Finality and kind of how do you differentiate the two?
00:30:29.370 - 00:31:21.990, Speaker A: Yeah, so typically tendermint like systems they require so let's say that you have ten validators, they require that, or let's say that you have 100, you require that in order to produce the next block, 67 of the validators, they must sign on the blocks, hash, let's say. And once they've done that, you can move on to the next block and the previous block is considered final, the one that they just signed on. While in Ethereum Two, finality only comes after. So Ethereum Two has one block per 6 seconds and one epoch per twelve per six minutes. And it only finalizes a block due to how the fork choice rule works. After two epochs. So there is a fundamental difference basically that in the if two kind of model, it takes you two epochs.
00:31:23.770 - 00:31:24.086, Speaker B: For.
00:31:24.108 - 00:32:01.406, Speaker A: A block to be finalized, but it has a kind of looser liveness requirement compared to the kind of quote unquote permission or tighter liveness requirements on BFT. So how do I say there's a trade off between having a tighter consensus algorithm which gives you the finality, versus having something that's more loose while not being able to have the finality. So it's a bit hard to explain this more in detail in this tense one, but I can expand offline if you want to email me, please do.
00:32:01.428 - 00:32:15.460, Speaker C: Yeah, I think if you're able to kind of comment on more on the chat, that'll be awesome. And then one final question for Phil, which is do proof of stake system solve mev in any way? And the question also says my impression is that the system in which some entity has.
