00:00:00.330 - 00:00:15.726, Speaker A: Okay, then we'll get kicked off. There we go. All the attendees are just coming, rushing in. Welcome, everybody. Feel free to drop your local time, your local place in Chat. As usual, there will be a tweet with you tagged Alexis, if you want.
00:00:15.748 - 00:00:17.454, Speaker B: To use global one.
00:00:17.492 - 00:00:17.646, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:17.668 - 00:00:26.360, Speaker B: No, I just boom. There it is. There it is. And I'm watching myself on delay now, writing this tweet. Beautiful.
00:00:27.130 - 00:00:49.370, Speaker A: All right, so it sounds like everything's good and yeah, let's maybe just get this thing started. Cool. Well, thanks so much, Alexis, for being part of this. For everybody else who's just joined Alexis, you may know him as co founder of Reddit, co founder of Initialized Capital, he's the host of Business dad podcast, and of course, most importantly, an Armenian brandy aficionado.
00:00:50.510 - 00:01:03.920, Speaker B: We all have our accolades. I thought you were going to say most importantly, father of Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. Well, of course, this too. She and my Armenian brandy are basically neck and neck in terms of things I love the most.
00:01:04.450 - 00:01:05.534, Speaker A: There you go.
00:01:05.732 - 00:01:34.650, Speaker B: She edges out the brandy for but for sure. Yeah. And I'm so happy to be reunited with a bunch of y'all who apparently are OGS from the Hack the north days. Got a lot of fond, fond memories from Waterloo back to back to back. I don't know if I went three, maybe four years to various events every year. Usually it was around which, you know, is a pretty special time or special place. But the Hack the north event is just legendary.
00:01:34.650 - 00:01:47.498, Speaker B: So it makes sense that you've got this community of builders and makers and doers now all participating in real time across the world building. Just awesome stuff. So kudos.
00:01:47.674 - 00:01:48.286, Speaker A: Appreciate that.
00:01:48.308 - 00:01:49.360, Speaker B: Just getting started.
00:01:49.890 - 00:01:59.890, Speaker A: Super fun journey. Yeah, awesome. It's been great to have you kind of as part of all this so far. Yeah. Maybe we'll dive into some kind of questions around crypto products, that sort of thing.
00:02:00.040 - 00:02:00.354, Speaker B: Sure.
00:02:00.392 - 00:02:15.880, Speaker A: Love to kind of get your idea on this. So I know you've been in the space as an investor for quite a while now. Maybe I'll let you name drop some companies if you see fit. But what excites you the most about crypto? What have you been thinking about, and why do you think this is a big opportunity?
00:02:16.890 - 00:02:55.220, Speaker B: Well, so only because you asked me. We were early investors in Coinbase a long time ago and continue to watch in awe as they've really brought so much of this to the mainstream. And that's been exciting. Brian and Fred were there so early and with such high conviction that it was kind of easy for Gary and I to get excited and want to invest. And Gary, my co founder initialized Gary Tanda. His credit has been really obsessed with the space ever since he started seeing the first maybe was. Well, you have to ask him what his first, but it was definitely a top post on Hacker news that turned him on to all.
00:02:55.220 - 00:04:36.840, Speaker B: You know, I want to believe that maybe it was Satoshi's White paper, but regardless, I want to believe that this is something that he really saw. Mean, frankly, I just know when brilliant people that I know, brilliant technologists that I know get really excited about a new technology, I want to pay closer attention. And over the last few years in particular, we've very deliberately avoided a lot of the, unfortunately, just scammier ICOs that were happening and all that garbage, and really tried to optimize for backing teams that have the exact same things we look for in any software startup like product discipline, engineering discipline, and really evaluating them as if they weren't building anything on a blockchain. Really trying to think about just like a boring software company that, yeah, if it works, has massive, massive, massive, massive potential. And I'm trying to think, I mean, actually, Horizon Rock and Ethereum is bringing to life a Magic the Gathering, where you actually own the cards, digitally, of course, but we're seeing different applications that actually make sense for the specific technology. So not just doing it for the sake of technology, but doing it because creating that kind of scarcity with a digital good is really interesting because it allows for increased value and then allowing free and open trade now brings to life the things that a lot of us grew up with. Trading game cards, for instance, or playing cards or any of those.
00:04:36.840 - 00:05:35.110, Speaker B: And collecting and saving and having real value attached that you actually own, right? You're spending real money on that fortnite skin. You're basically burning it, which I've done, which I do, I will continue to do until the better system takes over. And that resonates with us coming like bison trails, providing the kind of infrastructure that folks actually need to get started. A lot of picks and shovels type businesses, those are the things that get us excited. But first and foremost, it's founders who are solving a real problem and not just trying to run around with some cool technology looking for a problem to solve. And I think anyone involved in this too, needs to realize, and at this point, this is what I like about this time, because we're out of the crazy boom period. People who are still building today are genuinely interested in building real things.
00:05:35.110 - 00:06:14.340, Speaker B: And so I think the future for crypto has never been brighter because we just continue to see amazing technologists, amazing product people willing to devote their life, or at least the next decade to solving some really hard problems and building really great technology. And that's what's going to make all the difference, frankly. It comes down to user experience, it comes down to user interface, it comes down to the basic product things that don't require a world changing white paper, they just require you to follow sort of best principles for modern software design and creation and really just solving a real problem for people.
00:06:14.870 - 00:06:29.190, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think specifically for SkyWeaver, I cling to my card so much just because someday those could actually be worth something. They're resellable it's just a straight up step function improvement over other kind of collecting card games. Right.
00:06:29.340 - 00:06:55.520, Speaker B: So much. And a genuinely fun game too. I mean, they architected it. The original pitch was like, this is a proof of concept, but the more time I spent playing it, my username is just Alexis. Ohanian, I'm very creative in case you ever want to challenge me in SkyWeaver. Increasingly, it was clear that the proof of concept is actually just a really good game that does a really good job flexing their underlying tech, but it's actually just a super fun game.
00:06:56.050 - 00:06:57.950, Speaker A: Exactly. Cool.
00:06:58.020 - 00:07:03.630, Speaker B: Canadians, what is it with the Canadian energy around crypto?
00:07:03.790 - 00:07:09.286, Speaker A: I like it. I mean, I'm in Toronto, we actually share an office with the Skyweaper guys. Yeah, loved it.
00:07:09.388 - 00:07:20.934, Speaker B: But I'm genuinely curious about this. Is there something going on? Is this all just the Waterloo grads? Because obviously you all have a strong connection to Ethereum, but what is it?
00:07:21.052 - 00:07:53.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't want to share my bias too strongly there on the Waterloo side, but yeah, I think it's just the early community, a lot of it was here just because this is where a lot of it got started, I think. And yeah, I think it's just that community stayed really strong. The Toronto Meetup group is still one of the biggest ones. Lots of really smart people take part there. Obviously you've got a lot of good schools feeding that talent pool and yeah, every time we go back to Waterloo and run under Waterloo, it's been huge. Special place in our heart, too. Awesome.
00:07:53.874 - 00:08:26.874, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to highlight everybody's here, most of the people in the chat, but maybe not watching, know this for Hackfs, which is a hackathon where we're kind of helping build the foundation for the decentralized web. A couple cool things that we've seen so far. Know fully decentralized unstoppable blogging platforms. I assume Gary would probably, like, know an app to, you know, verifiable climate change data for the Paris Accord. That would be really cool. Archiving original videos so that they can compat against Deepfix.
00:08:26.874 - 00:08:45.720, Speaker A: Also pretty cool problem. So lots of really cool, kind of fully decentralized apps coming out of this, I guess. What are your thoughts on kind of the kind of larger value of the decentralized web and decentralized internet and that kind of movement away from centralization? Why could what people would be building here be important towards the future?
00:08:47.050 - 00:09:20.654, Speaker B: Well, we're looking at a world that is increasingly more Balkanized. This is very different from what I would have expected, certainly 15 years ago, but maybe even ten years ago. Look at heart. I've spent all of my adult years traveling. I've been effectively a remote worker for my entire professional life. Thanks to the fact that I've just started companies on the Internet and that I've just always loved to travel. And then I made some money when I sold Reddit the first time.
00:09:20.654 - 00:10:06.030, Speaker B: And so I could do it a lot more comfortably than I did when I was in college and traveling and backpacking through youth hostels and stuff. So I was like, oh, travel was great before. It's even better now that I don't have to share a room with six people. So anyway, at my heart, I really love all of the just I was an addict to all of the creativity, the discovery, all the best parts of so many different parts of the world. And I feel like I binged on it and loved it and drank it up. And so I find it especially heartbreaking that I think the next ten years at least are going to be one of much more isolationism, of much more balkanization. You're seeing it between China and India right now with the banning of dozens of Chinese apps.
00:10:06.030 - 00:10:36.966, Speaker B: I think Europe is going to carve out its own probably built primarily around privacy expectations, its own sort of form of internet. I think Canada is going to benefit tremendously from America's xenophobia and anti immigration policies. So you'll see a ton of innovation and value creation and job creation. So God bless. I wish we were getting it. And I think even within the United States, there's increasing tribalism. That's not going to stop.
00:10:36.966 - 00:11:37.578, Speaker B: Okay, so if I see the trend for the next ten years is much more about isolationism, much more about sort of looking inward, focusingward, finding one's tribes, then ironically, at a time when the Internet connects us more than ever, we will actually have more and more either government regulations or just sort of personal motivation to be looking more inward. And there are some benefits to this, I think, because it does allow for specialization. I could see a universe where even already German's sort of both cultural and political focus on privacy, and obviously there's a very good historical reason for that. I could see becoming a kind of competitive advantage almost from a brand standpoint. In the same way, Germany released a COVID app, a contact tracing app that like a material percentage of the population downloaded. I think Germany is like 80 million people. I think it was like 15 million.
00:11:37.578 - 00:12:02.942, Speaker B: How many people downloaded German COVID? We're doing it live app. Okay, first link. I'm not substantiating this well at all, but here we go. What do we got? What's the percentage? I was going to make a point with this, but I still want to make sure the number was good. Find the virus. Thank you, Hans. Okay, blah, blah, blah.
00:12:02.942 - 00:12:11.560, Speaker B: Okay, let's say I don't want to make this up. Someone in the chat is going to find this better. Okay? 42% at least said that they would use it.
00:12:12.250 - 00:12:15.062, Speaker A: I got 6.5 million downloads on great.
00:12:15.116 - 00:12:49.490, Speaker B: June, you're better at this than me. All right, so that's 10%, let's say it's 10% of the population. Now we can't even conceive of that happening in the United States right now because there is just such distrust of I mean, there was distrust when people were talking about Google, Facebook doing it. There was distrust if the government were to do it. Basically, nations are going to start to, I think, be able to specialize in a way that will actually be good. Because it will. Assuming that we can still have access to those technologies.
00:12:49.490 - 00:13:45.262, Speaker B: I think that sort of renewed. Focus will create more innovation because it gives sort of tribes their reasons to sort of focus and specialize, which has not been the nature of the internet thus far. But the very obvious downside is you're going to have multiple Internets over time. And the beauty of the web was, and I still believe is that notion of all bits being created equal and this idea that it was a level playing field for ideas, the technology was. So what does that mean? I think the value of decentralization in a world that looks like that in the next 10, 15, 20 years goes up massively because as humans, this keeps coming back to like a user experience question. We want the best user experience possible. It's not even about politics or culture.
00:13:45.262 - 00:14:43.880, Speaker B: It's about user experience. It's about making things that people love. And users, at the end of the day, individuals, people on a decentralized Internet will have a much better opportunity to sort of be in control of their own destiny and the things that they want and the things that they expect. And if the user experience is as good as it can possibly be, then in a lot of cases not all cases, but in a lot of cases, the decentralized version should be materially better than the centralized one. All of the things being equal from a user experience standpoint. I think actually the macro trends towards Balkanization and sort of isolationism actually play in favor of the decentralized internet because if anything, it almost creates it creates more demand for alternative, it creates more demand for more. So I think that the future is pretty bright there.
00:14:43.880 - 00:14:49.910, Speaker B: Oh, and hey, Columbia, Maryland, see someone in the comments. It's where I grew up.
00:14:50.060 - 00:14:50.934, Speaker A: Oh, awesome.
00:14:51.052 - 00:14:54.186, Speaker B: Got to make sure to ask the Quay Quay question after too.
00:14:54.288 - 00:15:32.360, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll save that one for the end, how's that? Okay, cool. And I guess maybe on that note, a lot of people actually are building some sort of decentralized social networks of some kind or communities, spaces for communities. Having run one yourself, obviously a fairly prominent one, what do you think kind of changes running from a centralized to a decentralized aspect? What are some of the gotchas to look out for? Just sort of like where do you think kind of the differences are between running a centralized versus decentralized big community, small community.
00:15:32.970 - 00:16:51.230, Speaker B: Well, so when it comes to the community platforms and this comes back again, I look at all through a lens of like if this were any startup, like let's get rid of the crypto Hype and all that other let's just say like, okay, well, what is the user experience? Like that's materially better for me. If it's a community platform or a social network, there's Portability, which feels like a ten x better feature potentially, where if one platform can really get to the critical mass and provide enough value for people that they want to switch, and it needs to be the last time they create another account. I think portability becomes an interesting feature. Now it's an extra challenge for you as the creator because you're basically from day one saying, I know this is going to be so good that I can make it trivial for you to be able to leave and that won't affect us. And so be it. Or of course you could try to build the layer that sort of connects all the future things in that sense of quote unquote identity. I think the biggest gotcha or the biggest opportunity would be and we've seen right steemit was a version I think it's still around reddit.
00:16:51.230 - 00:18:08.342, Speaker B: I deeply actually wrote this in our year end I wrote the year end letter for initialized last year talking about the value of attention in a world where there is infinitely I mean there's there are infinite alternatives that will continue to get better and better. And so being able to capture and hold attention because we all just have 24 hours in a day and that's never changing. I don't expect it to change, at least not materially. That means you have a tremendous responsibility to make something worth capturing someone's attention and us holding it. And so the value of attention is one that has not really been properly quantified before, but I could imagine could be. And so the way that I would think about that is like, you have all these platforms and I think Steam was an interesting approach. I would argue that and there's a good book on this drive, I would argue that getting people, paying people to do work they normally were volunteering for, devalues it'd be like someone volunteering in a Boy Scout troop and one day being like, here's your $20 every month, or whatever.
00:18:08.342 - 00:18:39.970, Speaker B: And they'd be like, this is weird. Like, I don't do this for money, I do this for the community. And I do this because I love it and it gives me joy. And there's no amount of money you could really pay me because either you'd pay me a stupid big amount and I'd wonder what's happening here? This feels disingenuous. I don't deserve a million dollars a month. Is this a drug front? What? And then if it's any other amount of money, it just doesn't feel like enough. And so it's like, well, why did you even do that? And it can really mess with the decisions that one makes because they're no longer doing work for a greater good or for a community.
00:18:39.970 - 00:19:32.260, Speaker B: They're doing it for pay. So I think you have to think about it, especially when you're talking about posting content because there's already so much, I mean, there's already so much happening behind the scenes with third parties trying to pay for promotion and whatnot. That I think the better way to look at it, the better way to go after it, is capturing the value in that attention, that time spent and where it's being spent is really valuable. And finding a way like, historically, content sites would do this through advertising. We know that model is screwed. The new wave that I like better, that's not just like clickbait CPMs is how do you build something where you get someone paying a recurring subscription substax a great example of this. Patreon, which is a portfolio company, is another one.
00:19:32.260 - 00:20:14.880, Speaker B: And I think that's really good. I think that's a huge leap beyond clickbait ads for revenue. I do think it still sort of misses the mark because what we're really talking about is like attention, right? You and I could both pay $10 a month to an amazing artist on Patreon or an amazing newsletter, but I might read for 3 hours every week and devour it and you for 30 seconds. And we're not properly being valued in the same way. Right? And there's different ways to spin that. There's different ways to think about that. But I'm waiting for something that has an amazing user experience that can reimagine the model of attention and content.
00:20:14.880 - 00:20:33.880, Speaker B: And again, this is like a big idea. And if I heard this pitch for me, I'd be like, come up with a wedge. Like come up with something that actually is working small scale and go, oh, interesting, steam is not around anymore. Awkward. Okay, anyway some drama there. Yeah.
00:20:36.490 - 00:21:18.742, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Well, yeah, maybe I think this question maybe prompts coming up at that wedge a little bit. But I'd be curious. I mentioned this before the call started. I think a lot of the technologies are starting to align. We're starting to get to a really good point where you can really build anything in a fully decentralized way and you should be able to take that product to the world and have it run with it. From what you've seen, what do you think is kind of missing from the kind of web3 crypto space right now that's kind of preventing it from achieving that sort of mainstream escape velocity? Or maybe put another way, like what would you love to fund in the space? Or what would you love to see come across the email pitch or whatever?
00:21:18.876 - 00:22:15.826, Speaker B: It keeps coming back to user experience. And no disrespect MetaMask, but a pivotal moment for SkyWeaver was when we didn't have to use MetaMask to log in when you could just create an account and go and the average user, the average gamer, doesn't even need to think about, oh, is this like a crypto thingy? It's about creating a user experience that feels truly seamless, as almost as mindless as creating an Instagram account. Like, that is the bar. And it just comes back to user experience, where I think it's important. We now have a critical mass of folks who are excited, who are early adopters, who want to be a part of this and are willing to install a Chrome extension or do this or do that. But to really break through, it has to be something. And this is willock.
00:22:15.826 - 00:23:02.946, Speaker B: This is what Coinbase saw during that insane run over Thanksgiving. How many years ago that was now everything's a blur two years ago because a bunch of maybe, wow, was that three years ago? This is quarantine life. Okay, so 2017, a bunch of people went home for Thanksgiving, saw a bunch of older people they never see, and everyone had heard about crypto, and they were like, tell me about crypto, Sonny. A chunk of America were like, yeah, here, Grandpa, just open a Coinbase account. Here you click OK. Well, okay, this looks kind of like my like that's literally. What mean? Not literally, but that is when a product crosses over.
00:23:02.946 - 00:23:13.126, Speaker B: And that that cannot happen if it's all right, Grandpa. Now, first we're going to go to installing a Chrome extension called MetaMask. Download it here. Yeah, I know. I know. You never installed extension before. Hit accept.
00:23:13.126 - 00:23:43.710, Speaker B: Yeah, hit okay, great. Wait for it to download. Right. That's friction. And this is just user Experience 101. Now, when you're dealing with something as super ambitious as the decentralized web, it is going to feel kind of crazy when you're talking to a regular person. I'll give you an example of a very successful Chrome extension, mainstream wise.
00:23:43.710 - 00:24:31.890, Speaker B: Oh, goodness, honey. Right, grandpa, coupons. You like coupons? These are coupons on the that's an easy that is an easy story. No one's getting scared about the Fed printing. No, it's it is, from a user experience standpoint, really straightforward. And so that is what it is going to take for the real, real adoption of so much of what we're talking about. But the good news is we're still in early enough days that you can be building the picks and the shovels for developers, for the builders or the miners or the people who are doing the work to bring this to the mainstream.
00:24:31.890 - 00:25:05.230, Speaker B: You're not too late for that. But you really need to know what you're building, and you can't do something in the middle. You can't fool yourself into thinking that it's going to live somewhere in the middle there. It either has to be squarely aimed at the mainstream or not. And so I'm not trying to tell my grandpa about bison trails because I don't need to. That's not who Bison Trails doesn't want to talk to my grandpa, but, yeah, I'm going to tell my grandpa about Coinbase, because Grandpa is a very late adopter, but you catch my drift.
00:25:05.570 - 00:25:12.298, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. So I guess for everybody who's going to be starting their companies out of Hack FS, think of Grandpa.
00:25:12.394 - 00:25:19.806, Speaker B: Think of do you really want to do with Grandpa? I mean, Grandpa's too extreme, but like, my dad my dad sounds just like my grandpa, so that's the same voice.
00:25:19.838 - 00:25:27.362, Speaker A: There you go. Awesome. Well, I think goes without saying. Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us, Alexis.
00:25:27.506 - 00:25:28.230, Speaker B: Of course.
00:25:28.380 - 00:25:39.158, Speaker A: I think a lot of really interesting info here. And yeah, really appreciate you coming in and sharing your advice on product and UX and just your thoughts on crypto in general.
00:25:39.324 - 00:26:00.110, Speaker B: My pleasure. And, folks, I retweeted this, and if you're watching on Twitter right now, we're right here in this box that I'm talking about, and y'all are welcome to just at me in the comments with stuff you're working on or ask me questions, and I'll follow up there in the comments and just at alexis ohanian, on Twitter. I'll put it in the Zoom chat, so you have no excuse.
00:26:01.810 - 00:26:02.414, Speaker A: There you go.
00:26:02.452 - 00:26:03.200, Speaker B: Say hi.
00:26:04.050 - 00:26:11.354, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks again so much, Alexis, and appreciate you coming out and catch everybody else pleasure at Hack FF.
00:26:11.402 - 00:26:14.800, Speaker B: Rock on. All right, be well. Jacob thanks, everybody.
00:26:15.530 - 00:26:18.210, Speaker A: Everybody bye.
