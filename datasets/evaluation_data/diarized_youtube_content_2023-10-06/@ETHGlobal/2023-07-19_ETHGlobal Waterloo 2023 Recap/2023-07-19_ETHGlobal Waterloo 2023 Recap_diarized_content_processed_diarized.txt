00:00:02.490 - 00:00:16.110, Speaker A: All started right here in the city with ETH Waterloo. ETH Global waterloo, what it do? ETH Global is the biggest community of the smartest developers in the Web Three ecosystem.
00:00:16.450 - 00:00:52.880, Speaker B: The first, ETH Waterloo started out as just a kind of manic obsessed kind of passion project. What kind of was clear to to me and a bunch of my friends at the time were we had a bunch of students that wanted to learn and build things and a bunch of companies that wanted to either hire them or test out their products. In fact, we put on reddit this post saying, hey, this event's going to happen, it's going to be amazing. And it went to the top of reddit our Ethereum. We got over 2000 applications in like a few days and we didn't have anything prepared, we didn't have a building, we had no plan at all. And yeah, we just got all these people showing up and it was just like this amazing, kind flashpoint in the industry's history.
00:00:54.370 - 00:01:01.070, Speaker A: This is our third time back in the last six years since we started in 2017 and I couldn't be more excited.
00:01:01.570 - 00:01:21.000, Speaker C: Whenever I go to the hackathons, I just see a very kind of high quality of technical efforts. Cryptokatia came out of ETH Waterloo and there's a lot of other examples of just big things that started off by being hackathon projects. So I'm always excited to see what's going to come out of this one.
00:01:21.690 - 00:01:44.718, Speaker D: I was here for ETH Waterloo 2019. It was cold and wintry, but very charming and cozy at the same time. This one just feels at least three to four times larger and everything's bigger. It's better, it's more exciting. Like there's a lot more tooling that people can use. And speaking to hackers, like, the diversity of projects has also expanded quite a.
00:01:44.724 - 00:01:59.140, Speaker A: Fair bit, particularly for this event. 47% of the people are brand new to Ethereum and that's incredible because we have almost half of them who are developers but have never done anything in Smart contracts or just in Web Three.
00:02:02.230 - 00:02:07.430, Speaker E: You can see this as a playground when you can experiment with your ideas.
00:02:09.950 - 00:02:24.000, Speaker F: Peer to peer interactions. It's just amazing. You can debate with other teams, you can debate with sponsors, share ideas, the feedback. It's like close. And since we are here, you take all the advantage you can.
00:02:26.450 - 00:02:34.800, Speaker A: I think it's really exciting that there's so many people here who want to work in public and share whatever research they're working on.
00:02:36.930 - 00:02:46.920, Speaker E: I guess my favorite hackathon was probably my first hackathon because I feel like I learned the most during that time. That was when I literally knew nothing about web three and I came out of it being able to deploy smart contracts and build like an end to end app.
00:02:51.850 - 00:02:58.460, Speaker B: The best hackathon products are the ones that when you see them completed, you're like, amazed that you even did that in 36 hours.
00:03:03.230 - 00:03:12.526, Speaker F: Today I'm really excited to just see what the latest and greatest is at one of the most exciting hackathons for the ethereum space in the world.
00:03:12.628 - 00:03:19.118, Speaker D: We've seen so many essential projects get started at East Global Hackathons and I think it'll continue being the case.
00:03:19.284 - 00:03:25.570, Speaker E: The people that were here was crazy. A lot of huge, amazing ideas.
00:03:26.310 - 00:04:20.830, Speaker F: I love hackathons, they're great. I think it's great introduction for people to understand what's going on in the space and to get a feel for the ethereum community in person. So it's important that they happen globally. Everybody has to start from somewhere, so just remember that and remember that at some point everybody was here for their very first time as well. To think that eGlobal now has been able to onboard just about 100,000 developers into the web three ecosystem is crazy. So it's far more successful than we even initially envisioned it. And it's pretty surreal to be back here and seeing all the folks that that have come back and the new folks who have never even been to Canada before and who come here just because Eat Global is here and they'll follow ETH Global wherever.
