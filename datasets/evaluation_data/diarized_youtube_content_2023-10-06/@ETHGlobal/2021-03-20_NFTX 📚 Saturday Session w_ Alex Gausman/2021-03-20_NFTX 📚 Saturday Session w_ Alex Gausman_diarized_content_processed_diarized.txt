00:00:06.250 - 00:00:23.280, Speaker A: Hey everyone, thanks for joining us today. We have Alex from Nftx joining us and he's just going to take us through a free flow session. And with that I will pass it on to Alex to introduce himself and kick it off.
00:00:24.890 - 00:00:53.422, Speaker B: Everyone. I'm Alex gosman, founder of Nftx. I did a workshop just a couple of days ago which was kind of like an introduction for this hackathon to give people a walkthrough of how Nftx works behind the scenes. I'm happy to do that again. I'm also happy to answer any questions. I've been told that people can be a little shy, so if nobody has.
00:00:53.476 - 00:00:58.602, Speaker C: Questions, I'll just kind of babble on about Nftx and NFTs.
00:00:58.746 - 00:01:01.418, Speaker B: But yeah, if anyone wants to interrupt.
00:01:01.514 - 00:01:04.786, Speaker C: Or ask a specific question, by all means.
00:01:04.888 - 00:01:06.354, Speaker B: I think easiest way is to probably.
00:01:06.392 - 00:01:10.258, Speaker C: Just put it in the chat. Yeah.
00:01:10.424 - 00:01:57.346, Speaker B: So a little bit about Nftx for now. We're working on version two at the moment. I've actually been rewriting that. It's been an interesting experience because I only started developing solidity in the summer after I finished my comp side degree. And in hindsight, many of the ways that I structured the Nftx contract, they weren't ideal and a lot of that was brought up during the audit, but it wasn't really security issues so much as just like structural things like the contract becoming way too big. So we've had a number of upgrades over the last couple of months, but.
00:01:57.448 - 00:01:59.634, Speaker C: It'S very difficult to upgrade right now.
00:01:59.752 - 00:02:32.730, Speaker B: Because the contract is at this 24 kilobyte maximum and that's partially my fault because of how I didn't refactor it properly. So we've been doing that recently and we think right now there's two contracts, nftx and Xstore. The XDR is like the state storage. So with version two, the idea is we're going to combine those two into a single contract to keep it simpler. I thought by splitting it up I would be reducing the size, but somehow it managed.
00:02:32.810 - 00:02:36.046, Speaker C: Each one ended up bigger with the interfaces or something.
00:02:36.228 - 00:03:16.106, Speaker B: So yeah, it's cool doing that. I think we're making pretty good progress on version two. We call it version two, but in terms of actual features, there won't be that much more. It's more just like a better version one or one point X that will allow us to kind of iterate because it'll have more space and it'll be better structured. But the main difference is a design change, basically an economic change. So right now, well, two things. One thing is we're going to focus more on D One funds instead of these D Two funds, which we think are probably the timing isn't perfect for them right now.
00:03:16.106 - 00:03:56.898, Speaker B: We want to build up liquidity with the D One funds first. And the other thing is that until now we've been putting fund tokens into sushi swap and we've been pairing them with ether. So we have a punk basic ether pool. We have the punk ether pool. But we've realized that it kind of bottlenecks us because we can only supply so much liquidity because we only have so much ether in our treasury. But we have a lot of Nftx tokens in our treasury, like over 20% of the supply. Of course we could sell some of those to get more ether, but we'd rather not dump our own tokens.
00:03:56.898 - 00:04:53.242, Speaker B: So the new idea is that we'll pair fund tokens with our own Nftx token. So you'll have like a Punk Basic Nftx pool and then we'll also just make sure the ether Nftx pool stays very liquid. And we've been doing this recently, just the last week or so, we've added this new Punk Basic Nftx pool. And what's cool is if somebody comes and they want to buy Punk Basic or sell Punk Basic and they want to do it with ether, then how that trade happens is it gets routed through the Nftx ether pool first and then it goes to the Nftx Punk Basic pool. And so then it kind of gives our token a more central role in our product. Because the idea is that our token will be used kind of as a bootstrap mechanism for these liquidity pools, quite similar to how something like Bancor works or synthetics, how they use their own.
00:04:53.296 - 00:04:55.660, Speaker C: Token to kind of bootstrap their platform.
00:04:56.510 - 00:05:03.678, Speaker B: And it can be difficult to do, but if done well, it can make the token a much stronger, create a.
00:05:03.684 - 00:05:05.486, Speaker C: Stronger moat in that sense.
00:05:05.668 - 00:05:10.970, Speaker B: And the other thing we want to do is just move away from the basic.
00:05:11.130 - 00:05:12.446, Speaker C: That's my bad.
00:05:12.628 - 00:06:16.690, Speaker B: People aren't very happy with how I added this dash basic to a lot of the funds. The original idea was that Punk I wanted Punk to be the D two fund which was like the index fund. We might still go that direction, but I think the direction we're going now is we'll rename the Punk Basic fund to just be called Punk. And then we're going to call the Punk fund something else like Punk X because we are finding that it's the floor funds that actually people seem more interested in and we would like to get a lot of liquidity into this Punk Basic or soon to be called Punk fund. And then another thing we've noticed is that people seem more interested in tracking the floor price of an asset rather than the average price. So like our Punk fund right now, the balancer pool, it's a combination of Punk Basic, Punk female Punk, attribute, four, five and zombies. And the idea is it's kind of like an index fund which actually gives you a moving average sort of of the entire collection.
00:06:16.690 - 00:06:33.926, Speaker B: And some people do on Twitter, they seem to like to use punk kind of as like a metric for the NFT space in general. But I think for the most part people are more interested just in the floor price. So they're interested what is the absolute cheapest crypto?
00:06:33.958 - 00:06:34.198, Speaker C: Punk.
00:06:34.214 - 00:07:26.022, Speaker B: And right now I think it's around like 21 ether. A few days ago it was around like 19 and so I think people are more interested in tracking that and that's kind of like what our Mask fund tracks. It tracks the floor fund. So I think we're going to move in that direction. We're going to have Punk be the floor fund, Mask be the floor fund, avastar be the floor fund. For kitties and axes it's a bit more complicated because the Axe floor is pretty low and the Kitty floor is pretty low, like so low in fact that it's not really usable with the transaction costs. Like for instance if we had a Kitty fund which literally allowed any crypto kitties, the cost of minting and redeeming would be potentially as large as the entire value of that item.
00:07:26.022 - 00:08:16.646, Speaker B: So instead we have like the Kitty generation zero, the Kitty Gen Zero fund and then we also have the Axe origin fund and so the only origin axes are allowed in that and only generation zero kitties are allowed in that. And we have this dilemma now like okay, so these other funds like Punk, Mask, Avistar, we're going to just keep the name simple. It's going to be Punk, it's me Mask, it's me Avistar and it's just me a floor fund. It's simple. And so some people they'd like to keep that consistency and they don't see it consistent. If we do that with Kitty or if we do that with Axie because it's not actually a floor fund, that will be an Axie origin fund and then it'll be a Kitty Gen Zero fund. So it's something we're discussing now personally I'm more inclined to like to give those the better names even if it's not totally consistent.
00:08:16.646 - 00:09:26.394, Speaker B: I don't think most people really even need to know what they're buying. All they need to know is like okay, Kitty, it represents CryptoKitties and if CryptoKitties go up, this will go up. And that's part of what Nftx is hopefully going to do is kind of my vision is right now the homepage, it's bad but it's going to be much better very soon. And it's part of my vision is that people can come to the Nftx homepage and you can be a bit of a novice investor but you can make smart investment decisions quite quickly because we don't want to flood people with too much information. Instead it's like you come to the homepage and maybe Kitty, if you want CryptoKitties we recommend the Kitty fund and it's like then you're kind of directing investors in the right direction. They might not know a lot about CryptoKitties but the fact of the matter is that generation zero kitties are very likely going to be much better investments than the rest of the kitties and many people wouldn't know that right off the bat, right? They don't even have to know that. They really don't.
00:09:26.394 - 00:09:57.114, Speaker B: It's like, I see our job. Of course, we have to be transparent. We want to help educate users. But a lot of users, they just want a simple product. They want to be able to come buy something, get some exposure, and kind of trust that they don't have to do too much due diligence on their own. So, yeah, it's something that I don't see other platforms having really accomplished yet. There's a lot of different marketplaces that each have their own niche, like Async, Art, and Rarible, but there's not really.
00:09:57.114 - 00:10:13.006, Speaker B: And OpenSea, of course, is the largest marketplace. Marketplace is probably the wrong word, but it's nice if investors can get sort of a framework for investing that guides them a little bit without flooding them.
00:10:13.028 - 00:10:17.026, Speaker C: With too much information. Okay, I think I've ranted for, like.
00:10:17.048 - 00:10:21.278, Speaker B: Ten minutes there, so if anyone has any questions about the actual hackathon, I'm.
00:10:21.294 - 00:10:30.760, Speaker C: Happy to answer those. If not, I can probably keep going. No, let me think.
00:10:36.120 - 00:10:37.348, Speaker B: A lot of things I'd like to.
00:10:37.354 - 00:10:46.296, Speaker C: Talk about, but I probably shouldn't just because some things we're trying to keep under wraps right now, and some things.
00:10:46.318 - 00:10:50.456, Speaker B: I'm just very opinionated about. It doesn't do us any good when.
00:10:50.478 - 00:10:54.990, Speaker C: I go offending other projects. So.
00:10:58.320 - 00:10:59.836, Speaker B: I'll talk about rare pepes for.
00:10:59.858 - 00:11:01.550, Speaker C: A bit, because it's been on my mind.
00:11:03.200 - 00:11:55.828, Speaker B: Probably don't have a lot to say about them, but yeah, the last couple of weeks, I've been getting into the counterparty NFT scene. It's been totally surreal. It's so ironic, because in the fall or the summer, I remember I tweeted about how I had sold all my bitcoin for Ether because I had found out about this crazy NFT niche in the Ethereum ecosystem. And I thought it was so cool and I thought it was so cool how everyone was using Ether to buy and sell these NFTs. So I was like, Why am I even holding bitcoin ether so much more potential. Yada, yada, yada. So I did all that, and just this last month, I've actually gone and bought some bitcoin because I've realized that it's the only way to buy a lot of these counterparty collectibles.
00:11:55.828 - 00:12:31.412, Speaker B: And it's just crazy. There's, like, this whole ecosystem of digital collectibles that I guess started up around 2015, 2016, peaked around 2017. Lots of collections. Like, not just the rare Pepes. There's also, like, Spells of Genesis, bitcoin farming. It's really crazy, because here I thought that Ethereum had the original digital collectibles scene, and then it's like, I find out there was this whole other ecosystem.
00:12:31.476 - 00:12:35.580, Speaker C: Basically on bitcoin and counterparty before Ethereum.
00:12:36.480 - 00:13:35.070, Speaker B: And it amazes me that in all the years ethereum Twitter and bitcoin Twitter have been fighting at each other, bitcoiner has never shilled this really cool ecosystem of digital collectibles. And it's almost like there's smart contracts on counterparty. You can set up these dispenser contracts and set prices. It's really cool. But I find it so fascinating that it seems as if the Bitcoin community isn't even aware of this. And I didn't really get into crypto until later in 2017. But I think it probably shows that a lot of the people that found this aspect of Bitcoin really interesting in 2016, 2017, this decentralized finance, digital collectibles, this whole aspect, I think a lot of that probably just ended up moving to Ethereum, like anyone who was excited by that sort of stuff.
00:13:35.070 - 00:14:16.344, Speaker B: And now what's probably been left with Bitcoin is more of a core community that's focused on hard money. But it's just crazy to me that here I am, I thought I was ahead of the curve selling all my bitcoin, and then this last month I've actually had to buy some back to collect some of these rare pepes and spells of Genesis. I don't think they'll be nearly as valuable as NFTs on Ethereum. First of all, they're not actually non fungible, so they're just non divisible. So it's like, for example, like the original rare Pepe Nakamoto card, there's 300 of them. If I have two and I get one more, then I have three. It's just a balance.
00:14:16.344 - 00:14:51.560, Speaker B: I can't say, like, oh, this is the third one, I got like a crypto punk. You can track each one of them individually, but in my opinion, it's still definitely kind of the missing link between these web two Neopets and then NFTs and DFI and Ethereum was that there was this kind of short lived ecosystem which is still kind of active. And it's cool, I've been collecting them. I don't think my main thought is that they won't have the same DeFi superpowers.
00:14:51.980 - 00:14:53.224, Speaker C: Oh, here we go.
00:14:53.342 - 00:15:34.164, Speaker B: Do you think there will be wrapping of counterparty collectibles on that's, actually? So originally the only reason I was interested in it was because I heard about a project who's actually working on a bridge. They're called Emblem Finance. Emblem. And I think they even have some assets on OpenSea. Right know, I haven't actually looked into the technicalities of it, but they appear to be trying to produce like an actual decentralized bridge. And so yeah, originally that was my main reason for getting interested. I was like, okay, if these can get bridged over to Ethereum, then now we're talking, right? And then I started looking into counterparty more.
00:15:34.164 - 00:16:21.652, Speaker B: My original assumption was that counterparty was its own blockchain, but I'm pretty sure it's just a client, which is cool. So the data is actually saved on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that it's actually secure at least for the next ten years or so, because it doesn't have to rely on some separate counterparty chain. It just embeds information, data into UTXO transactions in the metadata, I think. And then this gets interpreted by counterparty client. So the cool thing is that I've realized is that we don't really need it to get bridged to Ethereum. I've been collecting these things, and it's totally possible. I originally thought if I ever wanted to sell them, I'd have to do some OTC deal on ethereum, but it's like, no, I can actually sell these on counterparty through bitcoin still.
00:16:21.652 - 00:17:07.184, Speaker B: Again, I know it's not the same as actually having them on ethereum. If they could get bridged trustlessly through a very popular protocol, like Ren protocol, I think that would be huge. Of course, people could do migrations. You could do like a burn and mint, but I don't think it's really the same having the burn and mint. Part of what's cool about these rare pepes and counterparty collectibles is that they do still have an existence, which you can see that on chain, and it precedes crypto punks or whatever. Again, I don't think this hurts CryptoPunk value at all. It's like they're still the original non fungible token in my mind, but it's really so.
00:17:07.184 - 00:17:29.204, Speaker B: I've been collecting them. I wouldn't ape into them. But if they do end up getting transferred to ethereum, I think know they could definitely go up in value. I could totally see in the future, people wanting to have some rare Pepes in their NFT collections. One thing that's different from CryptoPunks is CryptoPunks. It was made by these two guys. I forget their name off the top of my head, but like, genius, dudes.
00:17:29.204 - 00:17:58.390, Speaker B: Fabulous project. They totally hit it out of the park. But in my opinion, it's still a little bit different than rare Pepe. It's a very grassroots decentralized. There was no single person kind of, like, running the show, so it's different in that sense. It carries a lot of history. A lot of it is offensive to certain people, and I think that just kind of adds to the history of it all.
00:17:58.390 - 00:18:00.516, Speaker B: I shouldn't go on about them for.
00:18:00.538 - 00:18:04.068, Speaker C: Too long, but could you mention a.
00:18:04.074 - 00:18:29.532, Speaker B: Few bitcoin based collectible projects? Yeah, for sure. Even though I'm traditionally an ethereum maxi. Yeah. So the first one that I'm aware of is Spells of Genesis. I think that it preceded I'm actually sure it preceded the original rare Pepes. If you go to this site, XChain IO, it's a block Explorer, and you can look it up. And then I found a website, too.
00:18:29.532 - 00:18:51.812, Speaker B: It's called SOG Bazaar, and they actually still sell some of the original SOG assets and they're still running. Like, you just send them some bitcoin to a certain address, and you get the collectible like, a day later. It's pretty cool. So I tried to get some of the earlier SOG cards, but it's mostly the rare Pepes I've been focusing on. There's another site here.
00:18:51.866 - 00:19:14.990, Speaker C: I'll just share my screen. There's another site, too. It's called, like I think it's like rare bits or something. What's it called? Bit bear. Frack find it.
00:19:18.320 - 00:19:20.700, Speaker B: The other one I was looking at is bitcoins here.
00:19:20.770 - 00:19:29.010, Speaker C: I got to find this down here somewhere. Here's some of my rare Pepes that I've been getting.
00:19:30.100 - 00:19:38.416, Speaker B: I've actually gotten quite a few some of them are pretty cool. Like, this guy here, there's only 42. Usually the rarest is, like, 100 editions.
00:19:38.448 - 00:20:02.970, Speaker C: But there are some that have less than 100. Like this guy, Pepe french una moore una Pepe. Pretty funny. Anyways, let's find this. Oh, yeah. Here, digire. That's it.
00:20:03.340 - 00:20:04.616, Speaker B: So, yeah, I found this site called.
00:20:04.638 - 00:20:05.400, Speaker C: Digire.
00:20:07.680 - 00:20:24.880, Speaker B: And it's just so crazy. It's, like, going through, like, a time portal, and it's like there's this whole NFT scene. Well, not NFTs, they're not non fungible, but, like, digital collectible scene. And it's, like, since 2015, right? And it's kind of just all died out. But if you go to Rankings.
00:20:28.500 - 00:20:28.816, Speaker C: You.
00:20:28.838 - 00:20:53.896, Speaker B: Can see okay, so here's, I guess, all the counterparty collections, and you can see that some of them, they are still active. Like, there's 24 users or 34 users in the last 24 hours that have interacted with rare Pepes mafia. Wars is second. Then you have bitcoin crops, kaleidoscope. So there are some others.
00:20:53.998 - 00:20:57.772, Speaker C: Spells of Genesis should be on here somewhere way down here.
00:20:57.906 - 00:21:01.804, Speaker B: So in the last seven days, you see that Spells of Genesis actually got.
00:21:01.842 - 00:21:04.910, Speaker C: Quite a bit, but just in the last 24 hours, it didn't get much.
00:21:06.240 - 00:21:13.856, Speaker B: So, yeah, I've been buying the bitcoins a bit. So what I do is I go to XChain IO, and then you can look at here, and it's like, this.
00:21:13.878 - 00:21:17.776, Speaker C: Is basically all the people.
00:21:17.878 - 00:21:24.100, Speaker B: These are kind of like the smart contracts. And it's like, these are all the recent ones that people have put up. So it's like, oh, pepe market.
00:21:24.250 - 00:21:27.110, Speaker C: Okay, so somebody's put this up.
00:21:28.360 - 00:21:45.300, Speaker B: There's only 100 of them, so that's a pretty good card. And then you can look at Issuances to see when it was issued. So it was originally issued four years ago. It's locked. It's important that they're locked. That just means more can't be minted. Divisible.
00:21:45.300 - 00:21:47.004, Speaker B: It's not divisible, which is a good.
00:21:47.042 - 00:21:48.200, Speaker C: Thing, in my opinion.
00:21:48.360 - 00:21:56.590, Speaker B: And then you go to dispensers. So it's like, okay, yeah. So somebody just added this to the dispenser, and the price is zero point 22.
00:21:57.300 - 00:22:08.000, Speaker C: So then what I do is I open this in my free wallet. No, ignore, close.
00:22:08.530 - 00:22:12.094, Speaker B: You go to Dispensers, add dispenser watch.
00:22:12.132 - 00:22:14.740, Speaker C: List, and then you go, pepe market.
00:22:15.830 - 00:22:19.954, Speaker B: Then you see right here, I could just hit, like, if I have enough.
00:22:19.992 - 00:22:32.280, Speaker C: Bitcoin, which I think I do, of zero point 18. I could just pepe market. Just hit buy now, bang, bang, boom, going to buy that guy.
00:22:33.610 - 00:22:43.834, Speaker B: And then in, like, 30 minutes, he'll show up in my wallet. The UX is actually pretty good. It's just that it's really slow, but it just blows my mind.
00:22:43.872 - 00:23:32.074, Speaker C: I've never seen bitcoin quarters shilling this stuff before. Let me make sure no one's asking questions. Pause, share out. Everyone's watching me as I show that I'm a huge noob. Bring all the front. Okay, here we go. Follow up.
00:23:32.112 - 00:23:35.766, Speaker B: Have you tried to try out flow's, cadence, language, do you have any thoughts.
00:23:35.798 - 00:23:37.630, Speaker C: On their structured linear types?
00:23:38.210 - 00:24:37.998, Speaker B: Yeah, so Flow is probably one of the projects I shouldn't comment on personally because I'm kind of biased against it. Honestly, I haven't even tried out NBA TOPSHOT. I know I should, I know I definitely should because I'll admit that Flow has clearly landed on a product market fit here and it's more scalable than if they just deployed to the base layer of Ethereum. But yeah, I haven't tried it out personally yet. I get worried by the whole situation that it's one of these things that it's like you really just don't know. I hope it all ends up decentralized and I hope everyone gets their money out and I hope it gets bridged to Ethereum, but I don't want to openly support it until that actually comes through. Personally, I haven't really looked into it much.
00:24:37.998 - 00:24:51.574, Speaker B: So no, I haven't looked into it, but yeah, I'm a little bit biased and I would definitely like Nftx to look into enabling Flow. So it is something we'll look into if and when they actually come through.
00:24:51.612 - 00:25:02.520, Speaker C: And build a bridge. Is there any competition to Ethereum? Bitcoin? Oh yeah, free wallet. Just hilarious. The free wallet thing.
00:25:03.950 - 00:25:12.060, Speaker B: Is there any competition to Ethereum? Bitcoin's block? Oh yeah, Flow. I tell people.
00:25:14.270 - 00:25:15.900, Speaker C: I'll share my screen again.
00:25:20.350 - 00:25:56.950, Speaker B: I have a lot of friends. It's funny, all of a sudden, friends that haven't been listening to me about crypto for years, all of a sudden they're hitting me up like, man, should I buy Flow? Should I buy like, Ada? I don't want to say bad things. Basically, one interesting thing you can do, token Terminal, it's really a great website and you can look at all the projects and how much revenue they're basically getting. Fees on ethereum. Fees on ethereum. A lot of people see it as bad because it means that you have to pay more. And there's definitely an element of it which is bad.
00:25:56.950 - 00:26:41.542, Speaker B: It's important that people can use Ethereum without having to pay a lot. But overall fees are good because it means demand and it means people are willing to pay for something. And I can tell from experience, I did not enjoy spending like $50,000 in December deploying on Ethereum. It cost a fortune, but I did it because there was really no other alternative in terms of ecosystem and activity and the amount of stuff getting built. And if you look at this graph here, here's, 30 day revenue, Ethereum is at 700 million, bitcoin is at 200 million. And if you look at this list here, so 24 hours revenue, Ethereum is at 25 million. It's like bitcoin, okay, like close to 8 million.
00:26:41.542 - 00:27:07.978, Speaker B: And then you look at all these other projects, like Unisop, Sushi, Swap, One Inch Keeper, Dow, Ave, all of those are just projects on Ethereum. They're not even their own blockchain. And then Bitcoin or finance chain is here and it's gotten $17,000 in fees in the last 24 hours compared to Ethereum's 25 million. And then a chain like Flow, it's.
00:27:07.994 - 00:27:09.762, Speaker C: Not even on here, I don't think.
00:27:09.816 - 00:28:06.734, Speaker B: And they would like tezos $400. I know these chains, they would say, oh, well, it's a good thing we have low fees. Basically, my rule is if the chain isn't even getting $100,000 a day in fees, then it's like, I'm not really even going to consider investing in it because it's basically vaporware. It's like, maybe one day it could have millions of dollars of daily transactions, but it's not even close to Ethereum or Bitcoin. And like, Ethereum with proof of stake and IEP, what is it, 1559? It's like stuff like that. These fees, they're actually going to be getting distributed back to Ether holders. Of course other chains will do this and I totally think in the future there will be other chains, there will be other niches.
00:28:06.734 - 00:28:42.346, Speaker B: I find Solana kind of interesting. I like their consensus mechanism. But again, until they're breaking $100,000 a day in fees, it's not really even something I would personally consider because it's just such a long shot. So, yeah, that's my two cent on that. Transactions are free. Yeah, I'm biased, so definitely take everything I say with a grain of salt. And I do personally, I would like Nftx to try and integrate with Flow.
00:28:42.458 - 00:28:44.474, Speaker C: And stuff, but yeah, I'm pretty biased.
00:28:44.522 - 00:28:55.966, Speaker B: Towards Ethereum and it's pretty astounding when you look at the fees and the metrics and it's pretty crazy. I think that pretty much somehow managed.
00:28:55.998 - 00:28:57.860, Speaker C: To use up all that time, basically.
00:29:02.150 - 00:29:07.060, Speaker B: So I didn't answer many questions, but yeah, I hope that was okay.
00:29:07.510 - 00:29:23.286, Speaker A: Thanks, Alex. No, that was definitely very interesting. You touched on a couple interesting topics there and yeah, plenty of questions coming in, but thanks so much for sharing your Saturday with us and everybody for joining and we'll see you in the discord channels.
00:29:23.398 - 00:29:24.870, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure I'll be around in discord.
