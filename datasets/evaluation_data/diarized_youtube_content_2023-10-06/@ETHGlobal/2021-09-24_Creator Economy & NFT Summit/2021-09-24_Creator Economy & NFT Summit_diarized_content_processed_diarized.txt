00:02:47.360 - 00:03:24.060, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETHGlobal and welcome to the ETH Online NFT and Creator Summit. So all of you are watching this thing on ETHGlobal TV. Just a quick note for all of the listeners here, this is a live platform, so if you have any questions for any of our speakers, you can just sign in and login and ask your questions away and we'll be able to relate those questions to our speakers directly. And also, for everybody who signs in, we'll be giving out a NFT PO app for your participation. So be sure to say hi and claim that NFT.
00:03:24.060 - 00:04:12.472, Speaker A: So this event is organized by Ethg Global. For those of you who don't know what Ethgobal is, ETH Global is an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to bring on thousands of developers into the Web three ecosystem. And we do this thing primarily by running hackathons and summits, and Ethanline is no different. So Ethanline is our biggest event of the year, and it is a combination of hackathon, which is a four week long event, and seven or six different summits. So for the hackathon, we have over 1100 people from 77 different countries spending 19 different time zones working on incredible projects ranging from Developer Tools to NFTs to DFI. And on top of that, we are also doing these summits every Friday, in addition to two other summits highlighting the compound in the Ave ecosystem.
00:04:12.472 - 00:04:47.348, Speaker A: So today is our first summit of this event, which is the NFT and Creator Summit. Next Friday, we'll be talking about governance and dows. Then we have our Developer Tool Summit on Friday, the Eigth, and we're going to end off this event with our Merge and Scalability Summit on October 15. So let's jump right into today's summit. So, we have six incredible talks that we're excited to share today. We're going to start off with Will, who's going to talk about the loot economy and how do you create a thriving NFT community. Then we have Gabby and Linda.
00:04:47.348 - 00:05:35.512, Speaker A: We're going to be talking about future play to earn. Then we have Alex from OpenSea covering what NFT metadata world looks like right now and what the opportunities are in that space. Then we're going to have an amazing panel on NFTs and Metaverse joined by Dylan from Figma, rohan from Dapper Labs, coin artist from Neon District and Drew Austin from Red Beard Ventures. And then Makota will be talking about the grand vision of ENS and how the ENS NFT and 721 standard can help own identity in this space. And we're going to close today off with Gov Sheet, who's going to talk about the lessons learned from Building Dark Forest, the most crypto native game and the most incredible game I've seen. So, without further ado, let's get started. I'd like to welcome Will onto the stage here.
00:05:35.512 - 00:05:39.508, Speaker A: And Will is going to take it from here and talk about the loot economy.
00:05:39.604 - 00:05:40.650, Speaker B: Will, welcome.
00:05:40.960 - 00:06:19.050, Speaker C: Yeah, great to be here. Thanks so much for the intro. I'm Will. I'm a co founder of Syndicate and creator of Adventure Gold. Adventure Gold is a token that is available for the loot community and was made for use within the in game loot ecosystem. Loot, as many of you may have seen on Twitter over the past couple of weeks, really took the NFT community by storm. And I'm going to talk about a quick oral history of Loot and then the key lessons that NFT projects can learn from loot about creating a thriving NFT community.
00:06:19.050 - 00:07:21.172, Speaker C: So what is Loot? Loot was released by Dom who was the co founder of vine and also made a number of NFTs, including Blitmaps, and he's working on SubDrive right now. And loot was an experiment and it was an experiment that was a totally free fair launch. He tweeted out a link to Ether Scan and said anyone can mint this. Just pay gas, put in the ID number you want and you can claim your loot. And the loot itself was text that is stored on chain that represents an adventuring gear in an RPG or similar fantasy game. So it's these items that you could potentially use in a feature game. And the thing that swept the whole community up was just how much the community could do with it.
00:07:21.172 - 00:08:09.220, Speaker C: Because loot was novel for its simplicity and that simplicity allowed a lot of people to envision what they wanted to build on top of it. So I saw Loot. I actually missed the original mint for loot. I was hiking in Oregon with no cell service, no ability to take part in the mint. But I saw Loot and I was immediately inspired by it and I thought it'd be really cool to build a effectively like an in game currency on top of loot because I knew that a bunch of projects would pop up on top of it. I thought that the on chain aspect was very interesting and I thought, okay, I'll build an in game currency. So I created Adventure gold.
00:08:09.220 - 00:08:53.304, Speaker C: And adventure Gold I wrote mostly in 4 hours in an airport in Oregon and then launched it live on a clubhouse chat on the Good Time show. And Adventure Gold is 10,000 tokens that any loot bag holder can claim. And those tokens, they were immediately used to vote on lore. They were also used to swap within the community for NFTs. They were used to permission NFT mints in a way that really expands the loot ecosystem. And Adventure Gold is one of many derivatives on loot. And this is what I find really exciting is that there's so many other projects that have popped up.
00:08:53.304 - 00:09:21.548, Speaker C: Two of the most interesting ones are Loot Mart and Loot Wars. Loot Mart allows anyone to unbundle their loot items so you can turn your loot into specific items. I'll quickly screen share what that looks like. So here is loot itself. Here it is. These text files that anyone can work with. Adventure Gold was launched from a tweet on a clubhouse chat.
00:09:21.548 - 00:10:10.064, Speaker C: And then Lootmart lets you I already unbundled my items, so you can see that they're unbundled. But Lootmart lets you generate these items based on your Loot bags, which is incredibly cool. And this is how they're leveraging the loot activity on chain. And likewise, Loot Wars is another project where you can battle your loot. So any loot holder can claim a weapon and these weapons can then be used in in game battles, which is a very cool aspect because now your loot items are going beyond NFTs that are in your wallet. You can start to use them in this whole ecosystem. So why did these appear? What made them so successful? I think there's three key insights around Loot for all of the subsequent projects that built on top of it.
00:10:10.064 - 00:11:01.410, Speaker C: One, the first lesson is that less is more. Loot's simplicity of the text gave the community room for inspiration. The NFTs left a lot for the community to build. Like you couldn't break the bags up into items that was made by the Lootmart team and that allowed the Lootmart team to make incredibly interesting art. And by giving the community less, the community was able to take that forward on their own in a way that allowed so many people to contribute. And that was, I think, the beauty of Dom's experiment is that it allowed anyone to build on top of it and gave them so many ideas of what they could do next. The second lesson about Loot is this is one that's very important for any NFT creator, is to think carefully about the tokenomics up front.
00:11:01.410 - 00:12:17.370, Speaker C: Tokenomics are the single most difficult thing to change later on. So, for example, with Loot, there's 8000 Loot bags and then there's also more Loot, which is much more accessible than anyone can MIT. And with the tokenomics, there's a debate in the community right now about whether Loot should be 8000 bags and whether that should be the version that everyone adopts or whether more Loot should make a really broad community and really spread loot to so many people in a way that makes it very accessible. And if you define the tokenomics up front of will there be more tokens issued later on? Will there be a treasury? Will there be scarcity? Will there be abundance? Think through these things before you launch your NFT project because afterwards it's extremely difficult to change and extremely hard to change. For example, from scarcity to abundance or from deflationary tokens to inflationary. Tokens nouns is an excellent example of how to do this. Nouns is some of the best tokenomics I've seen in the entire space.
00:12:17.370 - 00:13:20.510, Speaker C: With Nouns, if you look up Nouns dial on Twitter, you can find them and they essentially release one noun a day for auction. The proceeds from the auction go into a treasury governed by Nouns holders, and one noun every ten days for the next five years is reserved for the Nouns team. So they've created a token that is scarce right now, abundant later on, with a treasury that is continuously funded to invest in the Nouns ecosystem and define your tokenomics carefully. That's probably one of the most important things for an NFT project. Currently, 10,000 or so generative projects are the norm. Nouns show that there's a lot of creativity that the community can do that will benefit the whole space and the Loot and more. Loot show that there's creativity in how tokenomics can work and Adventure goal on top of it also has many lessons for tokenomics design.
00:13:20.510 - 00:14:00.292, Speaker C: The third thing that I think is really interesting is that on chain. Composability is the future. Most NFTs, they store their data on a separate network, whether that's a centralized web server or IPFS or another platform. And most NFTs are not stored on the ethereum blockchain directly. Loot was really unique because it was one of the few projects that does store data on the blockchain directly. And having that data be accessible to other smart contracts is what allowed derivatives like Lootmart and Loot Wars and Adventure Gold to exist. Putting all art on chain is the Holy grail.
00:14:00.292 - 00:14:42.868, Speaker C: But even just having on chain attributes helps a lot. So if you can make some of your NFTs accessible to other smart contracts, you can get a thriving community like Loot. And that on chain data is extremely important if you want a derivative ecosystem, because the on chain data allows the community to build on top of it in a crypto native way. Those are my three most important lessons from Loot and Adventure Gold. One less is more. Give the community room for inspiration. Two, think carefully about tokenomics upfront.
00:14:42.868 - 00:15:16.640, Speaker C: Look at examples beyond 10,000 profile picture drops. Look at more loot. Look at nouns. Look at other projects that have played with tokenomics models, because that creates a very different type of community that can often be very inclusive and fund an ecosystem in the long term. And then three on chain. Composability is the secret that made Loot work. And if you make some of your NFT data available on chain, you will see the possibility for derivatives to spring up just like the Loot ecosystem.
00:15:16.640 - 00:15:22.150, Speaker C: I wanted to make sure to leave some time for questions, so if there are any questions, I can answer them.
00:15:24.520 - 00:16:06.928, Speaker A: Hey, Will, this is an awesome talk. So I think we're just getting questions in from the chat, and as people hear this sentence, the latency and everything will start pushing more in. But maybe just to kind of start off with a few things you've already mentioned, it'd be great if you can give us slightly more detailed info on how Nouns work. So we got a couple of questions around that. So just walk us through what that looks like and then maybe to back up a little bit. It'd be also great for those of us who don't know what Loot is, to just kind of go into how Loot started and sort of what it is now and sort of what people have done. So you talked about the side of how you got into this ecosystem from the Loot side, but what else has happened in the Loot ecosystem from other efforts?
00:16:07.104 - 00:16:38.056, Speaker C: Yes, that sounds great. I'll start with the questions about the Loot ecosystem. So the Loot ecosystem I'll screen share again. So as I mentioned before, let's see, I'll pull this up quickly. Great. Yeah. So every single loop bag has these items, and these items that you see are all available on chain.
00:16:38.056 - 00:17:03.408, Speaker C: So anyone can query any other project can query these items on chain. So this is how Lootmart was able to operate. Because if you have a katana, lootmart can access the data inside of Loot. And this is what I'm referring to when I talk about on chain. Composability. And this is what's incredibly interesting. Loot Mart and Loot Wars are just two of many derivatives.
00:17:03.408 - 00:17:41.120, Speaker C: You can find all derivatives@lootproject.com, and this should give you a good sense of the types of development in the ecosystem. It's really incredible. Here is every single derivative of Loot. So we have everything from ability scores to abstract Loot, which made generative art based on Loot, to characters for Loot, companions for loot, you name it, the list goes on and on and on of people who are inspired by Loot. And every single part of this is leveraging the on chain. Composability.
00:17:41.120 - 00:18:40.680, Speaker C: There's also different guilds, which is really interesting. Guilds of Loot holders came together for katanas or for divine robes, to allow the katana and divine robes holders, for example, to be able to collaborate together and form their own sub communities. Within the larger NFT community, there's tons of developer tools as well. And of course the loot discord, loot talk and then loot builders and loot all got started from dom's tweet. I'm going to see if I can find it on Twitter quickly. It all started from this tweet and that's what it was. This was the origin of loop.
00:18:40.680 - 00:19:08.504, Speaker C: Everything else afterwards came from the community, just this one tweet. Likewise, Adventure Gold came from just this one tweet. And the experimentation that the community can put forward is incredibly important. That's a quick overview of Loot. I can talk a little bit about Nouns tokenomics. I am not an expert in Nouns tokenomics by any means. I'm not involved with the Nouns team officially.
00:19:08.504 - 00:19:50.392, Speaker C: I've just been following them since they're on Rink B. I put some tokens into Sharkdao which buys Nouns, but which buys nouns for the community. So I'm not an expert in this, but I will give my best summary of what I find very interesting about it. Which is that NFT projects in the long term should think carefully about how they cultivate their communities. If you have a really rich ecosystem of builders and contributors, you can get really interesting outcomes. One way to do that is to have a treasury. There's a few ways to build a treasury.
00:19:50.392 - 00:20:31.288, Speaker C: One is a treasury. That where the payments from secondary sales, such as OpenSea royalties, go to the project. That's what some projects do. There's a discussion. There were votes in the Loot community about whether that should occur for Loot. Another way also is to reserve some NFTs for the community where the NFTs are put in a treasury and the NFTs can be used by the whole ecosystem. The really clever part about Nouns is that most NFT projects it's just a mint and the team gets some ETH from the mint or sometimes nothing.
00:20:31.288 - 00:21:04.152, Speaker C: Like Dom gave away Loot for free and I gave away Adventure Gold for free and then that's it. Whereas with Nouns they do an auction every single day. And that auction allows them to build up a treasury that they can go use to fund builders inside the Nouns ecosystem. Spread the word about Nouns and Nouns is able to accomplish this because they're releasing one noun every day. They didn't release all Nouns at once. They instead release them. They're releasing them in small batches.
00:21:04.152 - 00:21:36.396, Speaker C: And these batches drive community. These batches scale the community in a deliberate way and it allows them to scale the community up from there. So I think that the 10,000 profile picture drops where everyone claims for gas or a small amount of ETH and the creators make money off secondary sales is a model that can use a lot of innovation. And I'm really excited for everyone listening here to think about ways to innovate on that. Nouns is one example, one noun a.
00:21:36.418 - 00:21:36.990, Speaker A: Day.
00:21:38.800 - 00:22:04.950, Speaker C: One noun out of every ten is reserved for the team. The proceeds go to a treasury. There's so many other options and I hope that we as a community can move towards something that helps build sustainable NFT projects in the long term and rewards people for contributions rather than guess wars. I think that we'll get to that position as a community and innovation like Nouns and Loot is just the start.
00:22:05.400 - 00:22:25.710, Speaker A: Absolutely. One other kind of question. I wish you have two more and then we'll wrap it up and let you get back to your day. What are some kind of lessons learned from launching Adventure Gold and what was the community reaction like? And sort of just what happened there? Post that tweet. And if you could do something differently, what would you have done?
00:22:26.080 - 00:22:42.896, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great question. So I had no idea how big Adventure Goals would get. I wrote it in 4 hours in an airport. I launched it live on a clubhouse call. The day I launched it, I ended up running support for 24 hours straight. I'd woken up at 05:00 a.m. That day, and I went to sleep at 05:00 a.m.
00:22:42.896 - 00:23:11.112, Speaker C: That day. I was not expecting the way adventure gold played out by any means. I think that the thing that was really good about adventure gold was that it was a fair launch. It was something where I didn't reserve any adventure gold for myself. I owned some loot, and owning that loot gave me some adventure gold, but I didn't reserve any adventure gold for myself. And I think that allowed it to be adopted by the community because it wasn't about anyone making money. It was about doing something good for the community.
00:23:11.112 - 00:23:50.596, Speaker C: And I think that fair launches, especially for NFT derivatives, is very important because it shows that these are not cash grabs. These are instead ways to further the whole ecosystem that everyone cares about. The interesting part is I expected adventure gold holders and loot holders to have a lot of overlap. And initially, every loot holder could claim adventure gold. But the groups diverged so much where after a few days, only 55% of loot holders held adventure gold. And there was a vote on whether adventure gold should govern loot, and that was split 50 50. So the split was extremely similar to the split of the number of loot holders who held adventure gold.
00:23:50.596 - 00:24:35.732, Speaker C: And I think that the diverging interests between adventure gold, loot, and more loot means that stakeholder management is more difficult. And if I could do it all over again, I probably would add vesting or streaming to adventure gold. Instead of getting all your adventure gold up front, you maybe get some adventure gold every single day for holding loot. And then loot holders would be more aligned with adventure gold holders. I'd actually coded seasons into the contract so you could start a new claim season and have a new batch of adventure gold available to claim. And I thought those seasons would be used pretty frequently. I didn't design the tokenomics to force those seasons to happen.
00:24:35.732 - 00:25:19.860, Speaker C: So it's up for a vote by the dow. It's not on any regular schedule. If I designed the tokenomics to offer the seasons on a regular schedule, I think that would have created more alignment with loot holders and adventure gold holders. So this is why I think the NFT tokenomics and the any derivative tokenomics are really important to get right, because a lot of your NFTs will change hands. Your projects will be held by a really wide variety of people. Some will be short term minded, some will be long term minded. And if you want a really thriving community in the long term with lots of builders and not just something that is popular and then disappears, you should do what Loot did and what I think more Loot and adventure Gold served to do, which is make a very expansive ecosystem for builders in a way that brings a lot of people into fold.
00:25:19.860 - 00:25:47.390, Speaker C: There's lots of ways to do it, but the scarcity versus abundance mindsets are very different. And if I'd coded in a forced seasons where a season would take place every three months, let's say that would create an abundance mindset by default. About Adventure gold, I'd say adventure Gold has more of a scarcity mindset right now because the seasons are by vote instead of part of the tokenomics design up front.
00:25:48.240 - 00:26:01.056, Speaker A: Incredible. I think you already sort of helped me transition to the last question here from our audience, which is, if you had any predictions for what the Loot ecosystem would look like a couple of years from now, what would you sort of say would happen?
00:26:01.238 - 00:26:40.888, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's currently a Loot hackathon with like 50 different projects submitted. You saw that derivatives page I was screen sharing. There's dozens of Loot derivatives, and just because not a lot of people are talking about it on Twitter, that doesn't mean that there's not builders. The builders I know are more excited than ever, and I think that the Loot community has really strong builders working on tons of different ideas, and I'm so excited to see those develop. These ideas are hard to execute. Lootmark was started pretty close to day one, and it took a while to launch because it was incredibly complex. They had machine learning to generate the images.
00:26:40.888 - 00:27:16.852, Speaker C: Each image took a long time, and it was very computationally intensive to generate. That's not something you can launch overnight. The Loot ecosystem takes time because really good building and really good projects take time. I think my call to action for the Loot community and the NFT community as a whole is to think about the long term, think about what your NFTs look like in three years and five years. Because people move on from profile photos, people will move on from all but a few assets. Just like in the 2017 ICO bubble. Most ICOs are now valueless.
00:27:16.852 - 00:27:51.856, Speaker C: I think that in three to five years, honestly, most NFTs will be valueless, and the ones that will survive will be the ones that cultivate these thriving communities, where it's more than just an image, it's an entire community and ecosystem around these NFTs. So NFTs are unique. They can be integrated into the ecosystem in all these different ways. Loot has an example of how to do that. Nouns has an example of how to do that. And, yeah, think about how to go beyond images and into something that builders want to build on and communities want to create lore around and something that goes beyond a profile photo.
00:27:52.048 - 00:28:04.920, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for that, and I hope this is insightful for everybody else listening too. We're already getting a lot of claps, and thank you for kind of clarifying a lot of these things. So really appreciate this, and thanks again.
00:28:04.990 - 00:28:14.524, Speaker C: Thanks so much. Yeah, anyone who wants to email me, you can email me. At will at syndicate IO or contact me on Twitter at willpapper. I'm happy to answer any questions. Thanks so much.
00:28:14.642 - 00:28:45.252, Speaker A: Sounds great. Thanks Will. And with that we are ready to move on to our next talk and that is going to be a far side chat between Gabby and Linda. Linda is going to be interviewing Gabby here. Linda is from Scalar Capital and Gabby is the co founder of Yieldfield Games. They're going to talk about what the future of Play to earn looks like and how NFTs and just gaming is taking over the world. So I'll let them do most of this intro and talking.
00:28:45.252 - 00:28:58.008, Speaker A: And without further ado, let's welcome Gabby and Linda on screen. Hello. Good. Awesome.
00:28:58.094 - 00:29:05.676, Speaker D: Thanks for having us. So Gabby, can you just give a brief background on what Guild Guild Games is?
00:29:05.858 - 00:29:54.168, Speaker B: Sure. So YGG is what we call a Play to earn gaming Guild. That means that we are a dao that invests into NFT assets of different play to earn games. Meaning games where you have NFT assets that earn some form of tokenized yield. These assets are then lent out to our player base, the members of the guild and then they play the games and basically earn some form of money that can be ultimately swapped out for Ether or to Fiat. So we started doing this in Axie Infinity where we were lending out axis in what is called a scholarship or a lending program so that people can earn money in the form of SLP tokens and convert it to fiat. Most notably in the Philippines.
00:29:54.168 - 00:30:12.770, Speaker B: This blew up last year during the early kind of COVID lockdowns where people were stuck at home and couldn't find any work while they were home and they found Axie as a way to earn income that was actually multiples better than their local opportunities at that time.
00:30:13.300 - 00:30:27.380, Speaker D: That's awesome. I am curious though you mentioned Axie. There's just been a lot of blockchain games in the past. What really appealed to you and your community for Axi and why do you think that that's become so popular?
00:30:27.720 - 00:30:28.132, Speaker E: Sure.
00:30:28.186 - 00:31:27.770, Speaker B: So Axi has been around since 2018 and what really changed was when they introduced the form of yield in the form of the SLP token. So SLP is generated when you win matches inside Axio Infinity and what gives it value is that there is in game utility for the token. You actually have to use it or burn it as an ingredient when you have to breed two axes to create a new one. Now you can't buy any axes from the team itself. All of the axes that are generated are bred or created by community members who are known as the breeders in the game. So for people who are breeding they buy the SLP so that they can create a lot of axes and then sell these axes in the marketplace to new players. So this is a very interesting kind of crypto economy that you see inside a game where it uses blockchain either in the form of NFTs for assets or fungible tokens for yield, as a way to kind of create an economy around it.
00:31:29.100 - 00:31:35.004, Speaker D: And then where have you seen what regions have taken off with this kind of work that you're doing?
00:31:35.202 - 00:32:06.870, Speaker B: We've seen it take off all over the world, but most notably it's taken off in regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America. So in Southeast Asia you have countries like Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia doing really well. And in Latin America you see countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, where I guess the income that people are earning here can be at times much, much higher than the local jobs that are available.
00:32:07.880 - 00:32:23.596, Speaker D: And then what do you think are the future of Play to earn gaming? Is it just going to be these scholarship rentals or what other use cases do you see here?
00:32:23.698 - 00:33:22.396, Speaker B: Right, so I think that the future of work is increasingly going to be in these virtual worlds and online games that are connected in their economies to the blockchain somehow. So right now we're earning a living online by going to different websites, doing some knowledge work. But I think increasingly there will be plenty of different jobs that will be available for people in basically video games, online worlds, and what we call the metaverse economy. So at the very basic, you may be a scholar or someone who is borrowing assets to play games and then earning some kind of income for that. There are people who are more, I would say, entrepreneurs like the breeders in Axie Infinity or landowners in a game like Sandbox or League of Kingdoms where, yeah, I basically own land. And maybe you're leasing them out to people who are playing the game. There's also a lot of people who are doing content creation around these games.
00:33:22.396 - 00:34:05.656, Speaker B: So Streamers, the YouTubers, who have their own followings. And what's interesting about this is that Play to Earn is bringing an additional business model to content creation where you don't necessarily have to be a top creator to be earning money. It's really hard to earn money as a top creator unless you really have a lot of viewers. But because of the business model Play to Earn, if you're good at the game, you can be creating good content and actually making decent amount of money at the same time. The other things I'm really excited about are really just the creative jobs that are going to be available in these games. So for example, you can be a digital fashion designer creating clothing for your avatars. You can be the one creating avatars or maybe buildings.
00:34:05.656 - 00:34:21.756, Speaker B: You may even be a blacksmith inside an RPG creating weapons for other people. So I think that the future of work is increasingly tied to the creator economy and really giving people access to jobs that are interesting to them and leverage their unique.
00:34:21.788 - 00:34:31.456, Speaker D: Skills that's really cool I know that the Play to Earn space is growing really quickly what has been the challenging aspects of kind of growing?
00:34:31.488 - 00:35:12.668, Speaker B: YGG, I guess there's many challenges, but interestingly, the biggest one has not been technical, it's actually been cultural. We've been, I would say, accustomed for the last 30 years to think that playing games are a waste of time. They don't contribute anything to us. And I've been joking that moms have been yelling at their kids for so long, about to stop playing games, and now these same moms are yelling at their kids to finish the daily. Quest in Axie Infinity so that they can get their daily income. So having that mind shift, we were actually learning really important skills when we were gaming. We were doing Mastery, we were doing pattern recognition when we were playing MMOs.
00:35:12.668 - 00:35:36.250, Speaker B: We were doing things like coordination, except that players weren't getting paid for it because there wasn't a business model for it. So now, in player owned economies, now that people can invest in the assets and earn, yield. You can actually get paid for this. It becomes a legitimate form of job, of an income. And I think we have a long way to go in kind of convincing people that this is indeed real.
00:35:37.660 - 00:36:00.224, Speaker D: And then talking about that. I guess whenever you turn something you like to do into a job and you kind of have to earn an income from it, it can kind of make it less fun. So how do you strike a balance with these games and making it fun while you're still earning an income? Does that potentially ruin the experience? I know people talk about that potentially ruining experience.
00:36:00.422 - 00:36:32.110, Speaker B: For me, I think people have kind of thought of fun as something they do outside of work and work is something they do for money that may not be fun. If you actually have the opportunity to combine these where you're doing something that you enjoy, have it be meaningful work and get paid for it. I think it actually aligns persons interests better. I think when people think of playing games for work as not being fun is when maybe they think of their fun as separate from what they do from work.
00:36:33.440 - 00:36:47.488, Speaker D: Got it. And then can you also talk about for those that are really interested in play to earn, how they can get started? I know there's a lot of different discords and there's just a lot of overwhelming information so what are some of the resources you recommend?
00:36:47.654 - 00:37:15.960, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So there is a play to Earn documentary that was produced by Yield Guild and Axie Infinity. So you can definitely head out to YouTube and look for the Play to Earn documentary. We have our discord. Discord? Ggygg. And when you go into our discord, you see a very vibrant community. We're a little over 60,000 people now that take a look at these different games and then form Sub Guilds inside our community to play these games together.
00:37:15.960 - 00:37:46.560, Speaker B: So apart from the players that are playing Axio Infinity, there's also discussion of many other games and then people can gather and play games like League of Kingdoms for example, or games like Splinterland. So there's a lot of different subcommunities that are forming inside YGG and if you want to just get info, there's twitter.com slash Yieldguild or Yieldguild IO for our website where you can mint a free badge, you just have to pay gas and that makes you a guild member.
00:37:47.720 - 00:37:56.052, Speaker D: And then you mentioned League of Kingdoms and Splinterlands. Could you describe a little bit about what those games are like and kind of how people play them?
00:37:56.186 - 00:37:56.532, Speaker E: Sure.
00:37:56.586 - 00:38:49.124, Speaker B: So for League of Kingdoms it's a strategy game similar to Clash of Clans, for example. The big difference is that players own the land that the game is being played on. So in the guilds instance, we own an estate of 286 pieces of land and the guild builds on top of it. And whenever money is spent on top of that land, when players spend on inapp purchases, a portion of the money spent goes to the landholders. So Splinter Lands itself is a card game that's been around on the hive blockchain and we actually see a lot of activity. And there's also a scholarship model where you can lend out cards to other people and they also have a land sale. This game has been around for a couple of years and we're seeing really good retention and engagement activity.
00:38:49.124 - 00:38:51.610, Speaker B: So I think the game is actually doing pretty well.
00:38:52.540 - 00:39:06.364, Speaker D: And then I know that a common criticism of play to earn is that how is this sustainable activity? And I personally know that just playing video games growing up there's always like gold farmers and all kinds of things.
00:39:06.402 - 00:39:06.780, Speaker A: That's right.
00:39:06.850 - 00:39:11.304, Speaker D: I'm curious to hear your perspective on how this is sustainable activity.
00:39:11.432 - 00:40:19.460, Speaker B: Okay, so the way I see it is that people are increasingly going to invest in assets that are online and on chain in these virtual worlds and economies. So when I take a look at a game like Axie Infinity, for example, I start comparing it to a digital nation and its daily volume is its GDP. So now what is in the game that will make people invest in it? There must be something that can give them either enjoyment in the game or maybe their assets can increase or maybe they're looking for some form of yield. So it's no different basically than a regular economy except you're controlling these inputs and outputs via the game and then these assets are being transferred to the blockchain basically in the form of NFDS for assets or Tokens for currency maybe. And yeah, that means that you have actually self contained economies inside these games. And as long as there's reason for people to put money inside these economies, then it will bring about sustainability.
00:40:21.560 - 00:40:26.500, Speaker D: And then I guess what has been the most surprising part for you when starting YGG?
00:40:27.900 - 00:41:20.520, Speaker B: The most surprising part is just the diversity of people who have found Play to Earn work. We're not just seeing kids who are basically creating guilds and then going on raids inside these games. People are using them either as an income supplement or in some cases, either as complete income replacements or even as their own businesses. From people who are trying to get to college, for example, to grandparents who are retired and are using this to supplement their pension. It's been great to see that there's a lot of people around the world who are now exposed to the crypto economy without one needing to know crypto in the first place. And second, they actually don't need to have any money in the first place. All they need is a skill that billions of people around the world have is like they need to have gaming skill.
00:41:20.520 - 00:41:31.804, Speaker B: So it's incredibly inclusive and we've seen that it has really included and onboarded people to the crypto economy who might have never wise been done.
00:41:31.842 - 00:41:43.688, Speaker D: So and then how are people finding out about YGG or just play to earn in general? Is it just like word of mouth or how is that happening?
00:41:43.874 - 00:42:31.020, Speaker B: It's super community based so the way that Play to Earn has been spreading has not been through traditional paid user acquisition channels like maybe a Facebook or a Google it's really been by what we call a community acquisition. So we identify community leaders around the world that are basically good at cultivating communities and we give them access in the form of NFT assets content and our tech platform so that they can create their own Play to Earn communities or sub guilds around the world. And when these communities do well with these games, when they earn some money, other communities get interested as well and it's proven to be a really good way for user acquisition without having to pay any third party entity.
00:42:33.440 - 00:42:48.868, Speaker D: And then also curious about do you see more traditional gaming companies coming into the space for Play to earn? And then if they do so, do you think that that's going to change the landscape much or are they going to kind of have to be more crypto native? Like how do you see that playing out?
00:42:49.034 - 00:44:00.810, Speaker B: I think it's actually incredibly difficult for the kind of giants of today's world in games to successfully adapt to Play to earn. A big reason for that is that their current model is doing really well and they may be for example, giant companies that are publicly listed that have their own shareholders. There's a lot of, I would say regulatory uncertainty in the world of crypto and NFTs and it's very hard for these companies to embrace Play to earn because there is the risk involved of adding a token to their game and how would their shareholders, their lawyers feel about that? What we've been seeing instead is that there's a lot of talent coming from the traditional gaming space in Free to play in MMOs, who are now heading to Play to earn. And they have the skills in creating virtual economies and they have to orient them more towards player owned economies where players are basically creating value and selling to each other instead of the publisher or the developer selling items directly to the players. But yeah, we're seeing a lot of really good talent start new studios right now.
00:44:02.300 - 00:44:23.360, Speaker D: And then one thing that I've noticed, and you're definitely more of an expert here, so curious your thoughts is the traditional gaming community can be a little bit toxic sometimes. But I've noticed that a lot of the play to earn community, they're really welcoming and helpful towards each other, kind of what have you noticed about the differences between the culture and why do you think that's the case?
00:44:23.510 - 00:45:29.172, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think personally, part of that has been the unique culture of Axie Infinity community. The greatest thing about Axie is that the game had always been attached with a very welcoming community. People who didn't know anything about crypto or didn't know anything about the game had always been welcome. And there's been a core set of kind of really strong community believers that have kind of tried to stay true to this culture even as it had scaled up to more than a million users. But in the greater NFT community, there's this whole, I would say, positivity and ethos of helping each other. And it's really my favorite thing about Play to earn where people are really happy that they're able to invest whatever money they have into excess axes that they're providing out to people in countries like the Philippines or Venezuela where people there might not have a lot of good choices for local jobs. And it makes them happy to be able to provide these kind of, I guess, new form of gig work to people around the world.
00:45:29.172 - 00:45:36.410, Speaker B: So there's a really strong undercurrent of that and I think it's really crucial to Play to earn even as we scale it up.
00:45:36.940 - 00:45:47.208, Speaker D: Yeah, I was actually going to ask that, do you think this is going to be sustainable as more people come into the space and then how are you planning on helping to maintain that culture?
00:45:47.384 - 00:46:41.740, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that it's going to be a real work in progress. There is no guarantee that this kind of culture will really persist as we grow bigger. And I think that's actually where guild communities come in. Guilds are a collection of people who are bound together and to do something as a group and that's basically what DAOs are. And we kind of use the guild and a Dao kind of interchangeably in YGG context. And I think it's up to us at the founder level of YGG to kind of express our values so that we can attract like minded people who want to stay in our guild and basically build together with the same set of common values. And hopefully that kind of radiates down to the sub guilds communities we have in different countries around the world, even as they tweak and localize basically their culture for their own unique communities.
00:46:43.040 - 00:46:57.444, Speaker D: And then regarding the guild structure, can you talk more about how that looks like internally and how do you keep up with all those communities? It seems like there's so many different sub guilds and different languages and countries. How do you manage that?
00:46:57.562 - 00:48:13.150, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely not easy, but we call yield guild a guild of guilds or a dow of dao. So we're not actually one guild, we are an umbrella or a federation of lots of different player communities. And the reason that we set it up this way when we started is that no one really wants to be in a guild of a million people, right? Like it's too big, it doesn't feel personal. So you want to be in a group of maybe your five friends going on a raid or maybe even 100 people who are in your immediate vicinity. So Yale Guild itself is set up into a lot of different sub guilds that are either organized by region, by community, or around the assets of a particular game. And that makes it feel smaller because you care more about your immediate community and people that you're playing with on a day to day basis than anyone else. But on top of that, yieldguild provides the NFT assets, the capital, the tech infrastructure, so that we can empower these guilds, especially these community leaders who are great at building community, cultivating it, recruiting players, and they don't have to worry about the technology side, the capital side, and we just help them do what they do best.
00:48:14.720 - 00:48:22.620, Speaker D: And then related to that, how do you hire people as a dow? How do you go about finding community managers?
00:48:23.120 - 00:49:24.210, Speaker B: So the great thing about community managers is that they're not employees, they're basically their own entrepreneurs who are good at building community and are able to monetize it by working with yield guild. So at first we work with community managers that already have their own kind of personal axis scholarship. Maybe they have a few dozen or a few hundred axis scholars, but it's hard for them to scale because it takes a lot of capital to create a lot of these axes and we partner with them, we basically give them access to our axes and the platform that manages it and we do a revenue split. So how the revenue split works is it's 70 2010, 70% of the SLP earned goes to the scholar or the player, 20% to the community manager and 10% to YGG, the guild. And as a community manager, as some of our managers have maybe over 500 scholars of their own, it actually adds up quite a bit if you're able to scale how you are leading your community.
00:49:26.180 - 00:49:47.720, Speaker D: And then I know that 70 2010 structure might vary across outside of YGG and across different scholarship managers, I guess. How did that break down? Kind of why is that breakdown the case and what else have you seen? And I know you have thoughts on some of the different structures. We'd love to hear them.
00:49:47.870 - 00:50:31.560, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's really important for us that the player or the scholars actually receive a majority of what they earn. I think it's really important for the future of the space that we are kind of changing the structure of how people are earning from a fixed wage, for example, to where they're being rewarded for their own upside. So that's very important for us. And that's why we give the majority to the players. And as they go online, it means they're not just having a job anymore, they're being compensated for something that matches their ability, which, if you do that, you're enabling a lot of people around the world to make money basically based on their talents.
00:50:33.500 - 00:50:54.304, Speaker D: And then I also had a question around barriers to entry. So, I mean, it can be really confusing sometimes for people when they're first starting out with a wallet and kind of learning about how to use anything in crypto. So how are you kind of helping to navigate that space? And have you seen what are you seeing as the biggest barriers to entry for people?
00:50:54.422 - 00:51:47.810, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually a really great question because crypto can be really confusing and I think we aren't there yet in crypto in the terms of just really seamless onboarding. And this is really where the magic of community comes in. So at Yield Guild, for example, if you come in as an Axe scholar, you don't have to know anything about crypto to start with. You don't have to know anything and you don't even have to have any money to start with. You're given an account, you log into that account, you start playing games and you start earning SLP. And during that time you're interacting with the community, you're being given content that will tell you what a crypto wallet is, how to play the game. And after two weeks, when you receive your first payout from SLP, from your revenue share in the game, you can bet that these players are very motivated to learn how crypto works when it's time to pay out.
00:51:49.300 - 00:51:59.920, Speaker D: And then do you have any numbers that you can share on kind of how large play to earn or some numbers from YGG that can put this into perspective for the audience?
00:52:00.080 - 00:52:45.924, Speaker B: So we are paying out somewhere between one to $2 million every month right now to our community members. So this is the 70% share of SLP that they have. So we have around 5000 scholars, which is a little under 10% of our community member base in the discord. But I think just if you think about how many people around the world would want to earn money by playing video games, I think we're just like super early. We're just getting started. I think that number will ultimately be in the billions of people. So while Yelia does under 100,000 members and Axe itself, the best performing game has a little over 1 million daily active users, I think.
00:52:45.924 - 00:52:48.230, Speaker B: Yeah, we're just barely getting started.
00:52:49.080 - 00:53:07.352, Speaker D: Yeah, that's so tiny compared to traditional games. So also curious on the investment side, because you invest in NFT land, what does that process look like for you and the community of how you're deciding to invest in something? Is there someone managing that process or is it just community driven? How does that process look?
00:53:07.486 - 00:54:00.696, Speaker B: Yeah, so we do have an internal team that really looks at these games as similar to an early stage VC. But instead of investing in equity, we actually take a look at assets first. So we look at acquiring the NFTs that give yield, we take a look at how the economy works, where is the money coming in, how are people getting paid? Is this sustainable long term? We like to invest in the NFTs and their associated governance tokens and while it is not community driven in the decision making, we do have what we call a play to earn council, where we get signals from the community on what games interest them. So we use the community as kind of scouts to see what's out there, what's interesting. And yeah, it's happened several times in that the interest from the community has ended up with us making an investment as well.
00:54:00.878 - 00:54:14.320, Speaker D: That's really cool. And then I guess what really excites you right now as you're seeing others building and play to earn, is there any trends or anything people should be paying attention to beyond what we've already discussed?
00:54:14.820 - 00:54:46.490, Speaker B: There's just an incredible diversity of new games that are coming out from racing games, virtual worlds, there are full MMOs being built, there are kind of strategy games. So yeah, that's the exciting part in that. Once all of these worlds get built out, there's really no shortage of choice for you to choose what kind of adventure you want to be in, what part of group you want to take part of and earn an income at the same.
00:54:49.260 - 00:54:59.180, Speaker D: So what have you noticed beyond the earning income piece really resonates with people about joining YGG or kind of the play to earn movement.
00:54:59.680 - 00:55:43.980, Speaker B: So I think actually a lot of people aren't motivated by the income alone. They like the concept of I'm coming in, investing my time and probably some money, forming a group with like minded people and going on these adventures and then getting rewarded for these adventures. So it's like going on DND with your group, but the money that you earn is actually real. So it's that rather than a pure financial transaction. Instead, the community aspect is actually stronger, and I think that's what makes it sustainable for any game or a community where if you see people having fun with these games before they start earning serious money, I think that game will be more sustainable.
00:55:45.040 - 00:55:58.444, Speaker D: And then we saw Will talk about Loot prior to this talk, curious what you think about how Loot and kind of similar gaming primitives are going to impact play to earn.
00:55:58.572 - 00:56:18.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I really love the experimentation around Loot. I think that the community is trying to figure out what kind of game experience is really going to be built around that. And it's not at a stage yet where YGG can see a game that earns yield that we could invest in. But yeah, I really love the experimentation behind it.
00:56:18.840 - 00:56:24.090, Speaker D: And then so what comes next for YGG? Like, what are you focused on right now?
00:56:24.540 - 00:57:05.780, Speaker B: So we're doing a lot of international scaling. We call it kind of like Uber for digital asset strategy, where we are going out region per region and creating regional sub dows with local community managers who basically know the communities on the ground. And while they're like smaller versions of YGG in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in India, in China, and they're kind of configuring YGG towards the particular tastes of each market. So they may be playing different games, for example, slightly different assets, different kind of nuances in the community and language. And that's how we'll be onboarding millions of people to play to earn.
00:57:06.280 - 00:57:13.450, Speaker D: Very cool. So I wanted to leave time for audience. Q A Kartik, are you going to be reading those off?
00:57:14.300 - 00:57:36.544, Speaker A: Yes. Linda gave it was an awesome chat. We have a lot of questions. We have a whole spectrum of things coming in from the chat. So there's a whole mix of people who are trying to understand what YGG and Play to Earn is and sort of how NFT and gaming sort of mix. And then also people already understand the YGG ecosystem and they have more questions about that. So I'll try to do a whole spectrum of a lot of these questions.
00:57:36.544 - 00:57:56.304, Speaker A: Maybe just to start off, you kind of touched on this a little bit, but could you give a slightly bigger overview on sort of what your community is right now? Like, who are your users? Are they students or adults or people with jobs as well as doing this thing for fun, like, just a little bit more detail around who they are and how they kind of the demographic.
00:57:56.352 - 00:58:46.550, Speaker B: Base is extremely broad, and I would say it's worldwide and from, I would say college age to adults. And even we see people 60 plus. For example, my dad is actually playing Axie Infinity and using it as kind of supplement to his pension. So it's very broad. I think 40% to 50% are around Southeast Asia right now, particularly the Philippines, where they started going viral, but yeah, we're seeing a lot of communities go up even in Latin America, across Africa, and even in places in US or Europe where the community base is smaller. But a lot of them tend to be more like the asset investor type, meaning they're the ones investing in these NFT assets and then lend them out to people from around the world.
00:58:47.160 - 00:58:59.160, Speaker D: I wanted to ask related to that, I know you've talked about your son and how he playing. So can you talk a little bit more about how he got into it? How old is he and kind of what was his experience?
00:58:59.310 - 00:59:27.040, Speaker B: Yeah, right. So my son is twelve years old and he started off playing Axio Infinity two years ago. I actually lent him some axes and he was just playing the game and earning SLP and yeah, that's actually how he started having a crypto portfolio and he used the SLP to buy the governance token of Axiexs when it came out last November and also to buy YGG tokens, the guild when it went public in July.
00:59:28.420 - 00:59:38.692, Speaker D: And then what does he think of all of like does he understand kind of the broader movement or is it kind of just more like kids playing games? I'm curious.
00:59:38.836 - 01:00:11.730, Speaker B: So interestingly for kids like him who have never grown up in a world without internet or even without cryptocurrency, it feels completely normal for them to have digital currency that has value. I don't think a lot of kids his age own crypto, but at the same time it's completely normal for them. Like there's no concept of what is a real currency or what is not. For him it's just another maybe digital points he's keeping track of, but this one is something that converted to fiat or to offline money.
01:00:14.740 - 01:00:35.400, Speaker A: Wow. Another sort of set of questions are just around understanding how the dow of dows sort of is structured here. So you obviously are a big focus there is on Axie, but could you walk us through sort of how you think about adding or supporting more dows or more games and just kind of what that process is like and sort of how you decide what to prioritize?
01:00:35.980 - 01:01:35.020, Speaker B: Well, this process is still very much, I would say, underway, but if there are regions being formed or if there's a lot of activity for one particular game, we basically create a subdao under it. And we did this for one game, League of Kingdoms, where it actually has its own token, Ygglok, that is owned by the members of that subdao and there is governance. So we set up a snapshot page for governance and they've passed several proposals, for example, where the yield that was earned by the land which is in Dai, was converted into CDI so that it would earn more yield on top of that. And then there was also another proposal passed by the subdao so that the yield that they earned in the last few months were actually they bought YGG tokens when it went live. So it's pretty interesting to see how this collective action in these subdos have their own little kind of sub communities.
01:01:38.960 - 01:02:18.376, Speaker A: There's like a whole thing I'm trying to in a way stop myself from digging into but we'll see how much we can go in. One big question that I have for you is obviously you have a community of thousands of people and not just like members who are on Discord or something, just active contributors to this. Let's talk about tooling. You're managing this at scale. There are so many different pieces here, so many different subcommunities. Could you talk to us about how do you think about Dow Tooling or It's tooling to make your own ecosystem better and sort of what some of the common things are? Just everything around that. We'll kind of dig into a lot of things from there.
01:02:18.478 - 01:03:34.432, Speaker B: Right? So our approach is we want to start simple and then figure out the bare minimum that we need and kind of just evolve as we go along. We don't want to start with a very complicated piece of Dow tooling and then kind of have to be stuck with it. So that's why we started with Snapshot which is super lightweight and actually we just hired a full time Dow manager who's already done the concept of subdows in another protocol and we are trying to see how does that evolve. So all of the assets are run by Gnosis multisig which is very important part of what we're doing. So if you have your Gnosis, you have the ability to create a token and then you can do Snapshot, you can basically get started with a subdow. And what we're building internally is a way to kind of create a gamer profile for the people who are part of our guild which means we are rewarding NFTs that are not transferable to people who are doing certain actions within the guild. And the non transferable NFT is a very important primitive in our end because it allows people to kind of prove that they did certain actions and you can't buy that or trade that off anybody.
01:03:34.432 - 01:03:40.420, Speaker B: So now you're creating a rich profile of basically achievements that someone has done inside the guild.
01:03:41.560 - 01:03:54.250, Speaker D: Related to that there's I think, a lot of builders in the audience. And what feature requests do you have for some of the Dow tools or things that you think are missing in the tooling space that you'd love to see built?
01:03:55.260 - 01:04:55.790, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very good question. I think there's really no concept yet of nested Dows which is what we're doing and just the ability to do that and then the asset management is also a very important thing. So for example, for guilds to be able to really invest in millions of dollars of assets within games, the lending part is actually really important. I have to be able to. Delegate an asset to another user, whether via at the wallet level or at the application level, and just trustlessly prove that they're able to use it, they have access to it without being able to run away with that asset. So this is actually still, I would say, the key missing piece that will allow NFT based economies to really grow to potentially trillions of dollars at scale. I have to be able to buy a land or then lease it out to someone and then have rights over that.
01:04:55.790 - 01:05:05.004, Speaker B: To be able to lend someone my sword and not be afraid that person disappears forever. So this is one of the key components that is really not been solved.
01:05:05.052 - 01:05:16.948, Speaker D: Yet, and is the way that you solve it through a new standard, or can you build on the existing standard and kind of iterate from there? How does that work?
01:05:17.034 - 01:06:09.620, Speaker B: I think the long term solution is to create a new standard that wraps the NFT ERC 2721 standard, and this adds delegation and permission rights to it. For example, if someone lends me an NFT, I still have to be able to use it in an application context. I have to be able to do smart contract calls with it, but maybe there will be restrictions on what I could do with it. For example, I can't sell it, I can't transfer it to another address, it can only go back to the sender, and maybe I'm streaming a payment to whoever owns it, and when I run out of money, then the NFT goes back to the original owner. So it's still very complex, and I think the hard part of creating a new standard would be actually getting everyone to adopt it, but it absolutely needs to happen long term.
01:06:10.600 - 01:06:11.156, Speaker D: Got it.
01:06:11.178 - 01:06:28.680, Speaker A: And then Kartik, maybe last question before we move on to the next talk. You obviously started this a couple years ago, and there's so much that's happened in the past few months alone. If you could do something differently, what would you have done? If you were to start YGG this year?
01:06:28.830 - 01:07:05.190, Speaker B: Oh, wow. So we actually started YGG less than a year ago. It's been ten months only, and just so much happened in the last ten months. We didn't foresee, even as one of the biggest fans of YGG, that everything would just begin to take off shortly after we founded it. I think shots I don't have really anything that I wish I do differently, but we've been very fortunate that we actually set up a way to scale this before NFTs absolutely exploded. And, yeah, I have zero regrets there.
01:07:07.720 - 01:07:19.460, Speaker A: Well, Gabby, Linda, thank you so much for that amazing conversation, and I hope everybody's questions got answered. If you have something else that comes up, we'll be able to relay those questions to you, but really appreciate your time and thanks again.
01:07:19.630 - 01:07:22.332, Speaker B: Thank you again, linda Kartik, thanks for having us.
01:07:22.386 - 01:07:23.740, Speaker D: Bye bye.
01:07:24.480 - 01:07:54.230, Speaker A: With that, we are ready to move on to our next talk. So I want to introduce Alex Atala from OpenSea as our next speaker. Alex here will be talking about NFT metadata and off chain and how all that works out here. And there's so much to cover here. So what I'll do is I'll just let Alex jump in directly. And without further ado, please welcome Alex. Hey Alex.
01:07:55.930 - 01:08:18.560, Speaker F: Hey guys, thanks for having me on. Apologies about the background noise. I'm in a train station in DC. Everything is quiet as place I could get. Great to see you again. Carpet. Let's start with the screen share.
01:08:51.080 - 01:08:54.276, Speaker A: It's still just loading and I'll yeah.
01:08:54.298 - 01:09:49.430, Speaker F: It still says loading for me too. Let me try to do that again or can everybody see my screen here without me? All right, I'll just do this. So wanted to do a talk about NFT metadata starting from the beginning and go into decentralized versus centralized metadata and where we see it going down the road. So to start with, let's talk a little bit about NFTs and how metadata fits into the big picture. There NFTs we can break down into a couple different components or a couple different themes that go into them. There's property data. Property data is who owns what and how many of each thing does someone own.
01:09:49.430 - 01:10:58.460, Speaker F: Some of these tokens are not truly non fungible, they're also semi fungible, tokens that people colloquially call NFTs, when really one user can own multiple copies of them. All of that is considered property data. But for the purposes of this talk, I'm just going to be referring to all of these media attached tokens as NFPs. We have property rights, which is abilities that a certain token owner can access by owning the token. These could be things like oh, owners of this token can access another asset that's on chain. Owners of this token can participate in a game that's being run by another smart contract owners or partial owners of some semifungible token can interact with each other in a special method to play like an on chain engagement. And there's a lot of creativity that hasn't really been explored for property rights.
01:10:58.460 - 01:11:45.440, Speaker F: There's also on chain history, what's happened to the NFT and when that happened, all the events that involved an NFT on the blockchain going back till it was minted or created. And then there's metadata, which is basically everything else, what the content of the NFT is, what information there is about it, what media is really being attached to it. That is what we consider metadata. It's a bit of a vague topic, but we'll go into a couple of specific examples really soon. So metadata itself we can break down into a couple of different components that we've seen so far. There's images, there's videos, there's animations. All of these can be attached to NFTs using metadata.
01:11:45.440 - 01:12:51.696, Speaker F: There's 3D models which are typically GLB and glTF formats. There's name, description, properties, information, about which address or who created it and also links to other resources like links to an external site. It could be links to other NFTs, links to the actual contract that you can use to interact with the NFT, or links to other environments that make the NFT special. So an important website to check out to understand this a bit better and really go into details. If you're a developer is docs Openc IO, there is a metadata standard attached to the NFT standards that you might have heard of ERC 721 and 1155. But it's pretty simple. So what Openc has done is expand the metadata standard and add rich properties and new things that develop.
01:12:51.696 - 01:13:44.156, Speaker F: We've just watched developers adopt over the last three and a half years. Openc started in December of 2018 and back then there was absolutely no metadata standard and most NFTs were just kind of guessing and throwing out random data inside of it from their smart contracts. Over time, more and more developers have adopted similar looking JSON formatted metadata. And all this site is is a way of collecting the most common and our suggestion for what your metadata could look like. And if your metadata looks like something that represents the files described in the stock, it'll automatically work on Openc. So here's an example. You can create rich traits.
01:13:44.156 - 01:14:14.532, Speaker F: Here's. Herbie Starbelly. This is the name OpenSea creature. This represents the metadata around the smart contract which I'll get to later. There's no creator data on this item, but there could be and then it would display in the description pane right in the middle of the screen. We have properties. These are fixed strings that you could just attach to a single NFT and you can give these strings trait type names.
01:14:14.532 - 01:15:08.350, Speaker F: So like this is a trait type of base and a trait value of Jellyfish. And OpenSea will automatically compute the rarity of each of your properties so that users can figure out pretty quickly how rare something is and what makes it rare. Users can also click on these attributes in the Openc UI and it will show them all the NFTs in your collection or contract that have that property on them. So you can easily visualize and explore your collection. There are stats, these are just numbers that don't really fit in any other category. And there's also levels which are numbers that are out of something that have some kind of maximum value that you want to configure yourself. So these could be things like generation stamina, anything that has some kind of max value associated with it.
01:15:08.350 - 01:16:06.060, Speaker F: Metadata can also apply to entire smart contracts, not just NFTs. Smart contracts are often represented as collections. On OpenSea, a collection is just a bunch of NFTs that belong to some common theme. Typically just one smart contract powers a collection. So we have name and description, we have the image or logo for the collection, we have the royalty. This is the percentage of each seller fee that goes to whatever the royalty recipient is. And whoever deploys a smart contract can instantly go to OpenSea and configure all these attributes about their collection, even if they forgot to do it in the metadata itself, as long as they own the smart contract on chain.
01:16:06.060 - 01:16:55.310, Speaker F: Here's the URL for going a little bit more detail about setting up contract level metadata. Notice that for contract level metadata we have a little code snippet here and I didn't show the equivalent in NFT metadata. It looks like this these code snippets are really important in your contract. For ERC 721. There is a method called token uri. Token Uri accepts one argument Token ID and returns a string. And this is how Openc will pick up your smart contract, the URL or the resource for your metadata given a single NFT token ID.
01:16:55.310 - 01:18:11.700, Speaker F: In this example, we take the base Token Uri for the whole collection and we append the Token ID to the end of it. So if you had centralized metadata, something like this URL here is a heroku app URL. You'd create your own API that just takes in a token ID at the end and returns NFT compliant JSON JSON that looks like this name Description Image Attributes if your API returns an object that looks like this, it'll automatically show up on OpenSea and after indexing happens, which sometimes takes a few minutes to an hour. Everybody will be able to discover it and search by these attributes on Openc too. So it's a very programmable web and you don't have to get Opensea's permission do that per se. As long as you actually own all the work and it complies with the terms of service, you will have an NFT up on OpenSea immediately. That's kind of the beauty of the whole concept permissionless innovation on top of Open blockchains.
01:18:11.700 - 01:18:44.128, Speaker F: So back to contract Uri. This is the equivalent of Token Uri, but for the whole contract. So here's an example. We have Openc creatures description, an image, an external link, seller fee, basis points. This represents the percentage seller fee that you want to take for all successful sales. So 100 would be a 1% seller fee and fee recipient. This can be a smart contract address or a wallet address.
01:18:44.128 - 01:19:39.840, Speaker F: If it's a smart contract address, you can use it to split the royalty between multiple recipients. You just have to call the smart contract to receive it. Next wanted to cover a little bit about debugging metadata. So a lot of developers get their metadata. Let me rephrase that. A lot of developers want to work on their metadata in real time, especially in testnets, and need some way to see if OpenSea is picking it up properly or if they've been following the metadata standards properly so we have a validate endpoint. This is kind of a nice little bit to know in our docs that not too many developers know how easy or how simple this makes metadata development.
01:19:39.840 - 01:21:14.610, Speaker F: But you can use the validate endpoint to take your smart contract address and a specific token ID and see what errors show up when Openc parses your metadata. This is especially useful if you're doing something unusual, like having both an image and a video attached to your NFT, or both an image and a 3d model, and you want to make sure that the image will show up in the Grid View on Openc. But the 3d model or animation shows up when you click into an NFT and see it large in a single item page. Next topic I wanted to cover is decentralizing metadata. So metadata you can break down into two buckets. There's centralized metadata which just get stored on some Google cloud or some server somewhere, and there's decentralized metadata which can either be on a file storage, a decentralized file storage network like IPFS, a blockchain like system for storing files like Rweed, or directly on chain, meaning the image name, et cetera. All of the metadata is actually in Ethereum itself or in polygon itself, whatever blockchain the NFT is on.
01:21:14.610 - 01:21:57.950, Speaker F: The latter is expensive to do because you pay to store all those bytes on the blockchain. And blockchains are typically not made for things like that. And that's why we have IPFS and Rweave, which are much lower cost ways of storing large amounts of data. So centralized metadata has two major downsides. There's impermanence server can go down and then you can't find the metadata you had. And this is particularly important for NFTs that are cultural. You want them to last like decades or hundreds of years or more.
01:21:57.950 - 01:23:08.900, Speaker F: So it really matters that they never go down and that there's some kind of guarantee to the creator and collector that they'll always stay up. And then there's mutability collectors want to make sure that the NFT that they're buying is always going to look the same and that the creator or anyone else is not going to be able to change it. We have a bit about decentralized metadata in our docs. If you use IPFS to host your metadata or Rweeve, it'll automatically work on OpenSea. You should omit the part that specifies which gateway you're using for IPFS and reveal that way if the gateway goes down at some point in the future, it doesn't really matter. Gateways are just a way for miners or relayers on file networks to relay files to any consumer. And you don't really want to be dependent on a gateway.
01:23:08.900 - 01:24:25.980, Speaker F: We will automatically ignore your gateway at OpenSea, but it's usually best practice. It's usually pretty interesting or something that hardcore collectors will look at to see if your decentralized metadata is truly gateway free. So here's an example of a gateway free IPFS URL and a gateway free Rweed URL. Another interesting thing about metadata on Openc is that we've added a couple additional elements to the ERC 721 and 1155 standards so you can improve the way your metadata shows up. One is emitting a new type of event called permanent Uri. So if you have the ability, if you let users change metadata for tokens they're creating on your contract, you can emit this event and then OpenSea will automatically see that, oh, this developer think that according to this contract, this token Uri has metadata that is no longer changeable. So we will consider it frozen, meaning collectors will see that no one can ever change this metadata.
01:24:25.980 - 01:24:39.488, Speaker F: And if you want your entire you want to tell us that your whole smart contract is frozen and you don't want to admit permanent Uri events for every single token ID, you can contact us on our help center and we.
01:24:39.494 - 01:24:40.930, Speaker C: Can help you set that up.
01:24:42.760 - 01:25:50.132, Speaker F: A couple of different types of metadata storage, backing up to what I was saying a few minutes ago, we have centralized and decentralized metadata. And even if you want to go with centralized metadata, you can make it verifiable on chain. So a really good example of this is CryptoPunks. CryptoPunks doesn't have the images on chain itself like on Ethereum, but they do have a hash that's stored in the smart contract, a hash of the combination of all 10,000 images. So you can check that hash to see if at some point in the future someone who stores CryptoPunks images has changed one, because then the hash of all 10,000 will be different from what you see on Ethereum. Likewise, in the decentralized camp, you can have both decentralized metadata that is stored somewhere in Rweave or Ripfs or directly on chain, but isn't necessarily immutable. Someone can change it later.
01:25:50.132 - 01:26:38.410, Speaker F: It's important that if you're a collector and doing due diligence on NFTs to go into the smart contract and look that up yourself, OpenSea will try to do that diligence for you. You should always do it on your own. And when we detect that something is not only decentralized but also unchangeable by the creator, we mark it as frozen and it shows up like this. You can hover over it and you get a tooltip. This item's metadata was permanently locked and stored in decentralized file storage. I there's a bit more I can cover about these four types. They're covered in our blog, though encourage people to check it out if they're interested.
01:26:38.410 - 01:28:10.800, Speaker F: If you want more details about centralized and verifiable NFTs and different examples, examples of decentralized versus decentralized and frozen NFTs, and the differences between are weave and IPFS, we'll gloss over those details, but feel free to ask me about them in Q and A. In terms of the future of metadata, I'm not going to go into lots of details here, but have a couple of guesses of what's to come. Seeing new kinds of 3D models that are showing up as animations models that aren't necessarily GLB and glTF. One example, see if I can just navigate to it. Right now there's a cool collection called Bonsai, and these NFTs, they're loading kind of slowly, so I'm just going to wait for a bit. They actually have USDZ 3D models attached to them. USDZ is Apple's 3D file format and it lets you your tree at it through your iOS devices camera.
01:28:10.800 - 01:28:42.512, Speaker F: You can use it for modeling. And iPad apps, what they look like, looks like some fog is not loading, but you can take a look at it and experiment with new 3D models. And we're very excited to work with projects that want to do something different in the 3D space. There's also NFT hyperlinks. I really haven't seen much of this. It's very surprising. I think that we haven't seen a lot of good examples of NFTs trying to link to each other.
01:28:42.512 - 01:29:27.920, Speaker F: A really early example was CryptoKitties. Every CryptoKitty had parents that bred it. It was considered an NFT Hyperlink, but it wasn't directly in the metadata in a way that was easily parsable. You had to look on chain and figure it out. There's also interesting metadata around multi chain items. So an item that's created on another blockchain and then bridged to Ethereum or vice versa will often have information in the metadata about Wallets that exist in non EVM chains and which Wallets created it, which Wallet currently owns it. And OpenSea is very excited to work with developers building ridge metadata standards.
01:29:27.920 - 01:30:13.600, Speaker F: There's also richer unlockable content right now. If you want to give owners the ability to unlock content on OpenSea, you can only use text. Right now there aren't a lot of standards around unlockable content because something is being hidden and can't be revealed on chain. But I think it would be really exciting to figure out how to enforce secrecy with some parts of the content and support that in secondary marketplaces like Openc. Lastly, there's legal attachments and licenses. Licenses are an incredibly undertapped area of NFTs. Imagine font licenses, for example.
01:30:13.600 - 01:31:07.760, Speaker F: Every time you buy a font, it's important for fonts to be scarce. Otherwise you just see it on too many websites and it's not special anymore. So imagine buying fonts and being able to trade them on the secondary market to find the true market value. But also provably show that you own the license to a font and not have to jump through these really strange, centralized and obscure or opaque marketplaces that currently power. But point is that metadata standards are not supposed to constrain creativity around NFPs. This is really the beginning of them and it's likely going to change dramatically in just a year's time. So if you're working on something new, sorry about the background noise.
01:31:07.760 - 01:31:10.850, Speaker F: Don't let these standards constrain you.
01:31:15.560 - 01:31:52.530, Speaker A: Awesome. Alex, thank you so much for that amazing talk. Interestingly, so many of our listeners are developers. I think that Q A turned into customer support for the devtooling side. So I'll try to filter some of those questions out but two kind of obvious questions that I have from our chat is people are very curious to hear about how the split or just sort of the developer experience has been like on RV versus IPFS. And if you've noticed anything that's either easier or not easier compared to as people are maintaining NFTs and adding metadata there.
01:31:55.620 - 01:32:45.840, Speaker F: Yeah, good question. We've seen a lot of adoption recently for and there are parts of it I think that are really exciting. It's a bit more like a blockchain. With IPFS, it's important to know how many nodes have copies of your metadata, and I think they're working on making the redundancy more transparent and easier to check out from a collector's point of view. But to answer your question directly, we see a lot more NFTs using IPFS than areweed on Ethereum. On other blockchains, the IPFS dominance is a lot less and I think that's where we're seeing the most. Are we growth?
01:32:46.740 - 01:33:09.450, Speaker A: Awesome. Another sort of questions on that same topic is what happens or how often do you run into scenarios where anywhere from the metadata to the underlying asset just isn't available? If the permalink kind of disappears, do you run into invalidation of content or is everything actually permanent? You haven't prioritized these types of scenarios as much.
01:33:11.580 - 01:33:52.820, Speaker F: OpenSea caches metadata in our own cloud, and if we see that we can't access the metadata because the centralized server is down now, we keep whatever copy we had before in our cloud. So it's a way of giving collectors a little bit more peace of mind in case something disappears. We have seen this happen a few times, and sometimes the mid idea just goes back up on the original server like a few weeks later, or sometimes the game or the server really does go down forever, but we've just kept our copies and maintained redundancy in those places.
01:33:53.160 - 01:34:09.610, Speaker A: Awesome. And the last question is a lot of people have asked if they can go through the slides in more detail on their own pace. So if you can send us a link to the slides, we'll be able to share that either on the chat or post this summit to everybody online.
01:34:13.020 - 01:34:13.972, Speaker F: Well done.
01:34:14.126 - 01:34:18.380, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you so much, Alex, and hope you enjoy the rest of your trip.
01:34:20.980 - 01:34:23.010, Speaker F: Sounds good. Thanks for having me.
01:34:23.460 - 01:34:24.210, Speaker E: Great.
01:34:25.780 - 01:34:59.004, Speaker A: Next up we have our amazing panel. We're going to be talking about NFTs and Metaverse. For this panel we'll have four amazing people join us. We have Dylan from Figma. We have Rohan from Dapper labs. We have Marguerite from Neon district and Moderating. This panel will be Drew Austin from Red Beard Ventures and I'll welcome all of them here and have Drew sort of go into introducing all of our panelists and having them talk about who they are.
01:34:59.004 - 01:35:02.620, Speaker A: So without further ado, let's welcome our amazing panel.
01:35:14.740 - 01:35:16.050, Speaker E: How are we doing, everybody?
01:35:16.820 - 01:35:18.128, Speaker G: Good, how are you doing?
01:35:18.294 - 01:35:22.210, Speaker E: I'm doing good. Are we jumping right in. We're ready to go?
01:35:24.020 - 01:35:25.056, Speaker A: Yes, you are.
01:35:25.158 - 01:35:25.984, Speaker F: Either way.
01:35:26.102 - 01:35:26.496, Speaker A: Let's go.
01:35:26.518 - 01:35:45.370, Speaker E: Let's do it. All right. Hi everybody. I'm Drew Austin. I'm managing partner over at Redbeard Ventures. And just a real brief, we'll do a quick round of intros because I think everyone here has just got such an awesome story. And then we'll jump in and start talking metaverse NFTs and see where it goes.
01:35:45.370 - 01:36:52.112, Speaker E: So, my background, I've been a founder 15 years in different frontier technology companies and over the last twelve months started up a venture capital syndicate called Red Beard Ventures have been very active in the blockchain metaverse NFT space investors investing in two of the companies up here with Dapper and Marguerite's company as well, Brahm. So we've invested in a variety of different metaverses, from Wilder World to Superworld to sandbox and art marketplaces like Super Rare, and gaming companies like Zedrun. So we're really active in the space. We're really excited about investing in these ecosystems like the Flow ecosystem and some of the companies that are building on top of Flow. And personally, I'm an active investor in NFTs themselves. I'm the top 50 portfolio holder on TOPSHOT and Big Stable on Zed run and a lot of sandbox land that we develop. And then recently we just released our own NFT project called Knights of Dgen, which is a really cool project I did with a great team of people.
01:36:52.112 - 01:37:04.580, Speaker E: And we're having a blast, man. Just learning and building and creating and investing and just meeting great people. So that's been my story. Marguerite, you want to introduce yourself real quick? Absolutely.
01:37:04.650 - 01:37:26.184, Speaker H: Thanks, Drew. So Marguerite decorcel. I'm CEO of Blockade Games. We're building Neon District, which is a cyberpunk RPG. We have dynamic NFTs that evolve through the gameplay. I've been in this space, the Blockade has been around for about four years now. I've been in creative technology and in the crypto space, specifically since 2014, was one of the first artists in this space.
01:37:26.184 - 01:38:03.110, Speaker H: I've gotten to be here and see the entire space evolve as we've been exploring what's possible for creatives with blockchain technology. So, of course I'm having a blast watching all the possibilities and iterations on NFTs and where we are today. Everything from know and seeing people explore the different gamification tactics, plus just fine art in general, watching Sotheby's and Christie's take off and get around behind NFTs this year, it's been a blast. So anyways, I'm very passionate about the intersection of the metaverse, gaming, fine art and yeah, awesome.
01:38:03.480 - 01:38:04.868, Speaker E: Dylan, you want to go?
01:38:05.034 - 01:38:48.692, Speaker G: Sure. Hi everybody. Good to see you all. My name is Dylan, I'm the CEO and co founder of Figma, and we are a design platform, so trying to make it so you can do everything from whiteboard and brainstorm all the way to design UI and UX to get that code into production. And my interest in NFT started really with the crypto punks launch started to track it then was real lucky to kind of be earlier on the earlier side there. And then with OpenSea was thankful to me being a seed investor and have tried to be supportive and active in ecosystem since. And it's been amazing to watch this past six months, eight months, nine months, whatever.
01:38:48.692 - 01:39:32.252, Speaker G: I don't know what time is. And to see what's happening in the world of NFTs. I think it's just an absolutely fascinating primitive that we're going to see be explored in so many different ways. And I think even on this call, we've got a few different ways that it's being explored that we can talk about. I remember actually at ETH Denver, when Neon District launched from the Hackathon project and I was like, that's fucking. And so it's just awesome to think about at this event, what will be the projects that will be like the next Neon District? Or actually, I remember when my wife then girlfriend was at ETH Waterloo, and she's like, man, I just saw this really cool thing. It's called CryptoKitties.
01:39:32.252 - 01:39:38.724, Speaker G: So there's been so many amazing projects that have come out of the ETH Global ecosystem and I can't wait to see what's going to come out of this one.
01:39:38.922 - 01:40:06.190, Speaker E: Awesome, ro. Yeah. Thanks, Drew. My name is Ron Gargosloof, co founder and CEO of Dapper Labs. We've been big believers in the NFT space for a while. Authored the original ERC 721 standard on ethereum built CryptoKitties, most recently focused on NBA TOPSHOT and taking the NFTs to the sports world. And you might have seen we announced the Liga Partnership a couple of days ago, another big one coming next week.
01:40:06.190 - 01:40:44.516, Speaker E: And we're also the original developers behind the flow blockchain, which at this point has several thousand developers and Fortune 500 companies building on top of it. But I have a very soft spot in my heart for ETH Global events exactly because of what Dylan mentioned. I don't think CryptoKitties would have happened if it wasn't for ETH Global. And just bringing the community together, giving we put little pictures of cats on Pokemon cards and it was sort of the first time. It's like, hey, cats can be collectible too. And sort of getting that kind of energy to kick off the project was super critical. So really excited to be here and to talk NFTs.
01:40:44.516 - 01:41:00.910, Speaker E: I think we're absolutely at the start of this journey. And so everyone here is right place, right time. Four years ago, maybe we're a little bit early. We had to grind a little bit. But I think the next four years is going to be going to be super fast. All right, awesome. So let's start a little bit.
01:41:00.910 - 01:41:52.108, Speaker E: I think it's really interesting we have so many different approaches. I think there are some things like it's obvious when you think of Blockchain and NFTs that gaming has a place for it, sports cards have a place for it, art has a place for it. Does anyone find it interesting? And what are your thoughts on this PFP movement, the profile picture movement? It is fascinating to me that of all the things that really would have struck a chord with people that these PFP concepts and communities really took off. And I'm curious, your mean, you've been in the space for so long and you've been involved in some of the, I would say some of the more complex but also powerful concepts behind NFTs. This is kind of simple in a way, but powerful in, you know, what are your thoughts on it?
01:41:52.274 - 01:42:45.310, Speaker H: You know, what I think is really interesting about that is it is the most tangible. I feel like when we think about the beginning of NFTs and how people can understand what they are, like the fact you can have these generative experiences of creating these images, there's really no in a lot of cases there's not a real formula that's like a gamified formula to them. They're just like here's this drop and then we've generated all these and then there's just rarities assigned to the different versions that are created, which I think back to CryptoKitties and how much more CryptoKitties was way more sophisticated and conceptually how they had DNA and just the components. So I find it interesting that people the complexity and what was interesting as far as smart contract development around CryptoKitties as well is not being utilized in most cases with these PFP projects. It's really just the art. It's like this visual understanding of the transfer. We can transfer the images and people are just excited about that.
01:42:45.310 - 01:43:52.768, Speaker H: They're really excited about the most simple part of the entire world of what we're developing around NFTs. And actually Dylan with Moji. Like, I have an ethmoji. Ethmoji was one of the first PFP sort of projects where you have an avatar and actually I believe you worked alongside the OpenSea founding team prior to OpenSea on so you had this composable it's a composable avatar essentially and it's a user driven so you can build them. When are we going to get from people from this phase of being given these generative pieces to where they get more excited about having hands on building? As far as the outcome, I think everyone's learning that a limited distribution of 10,000 assets only for the function of this idea of creating Rarity, but then we're paywalling out any continued distribution of that model doesn't really work. And I think everyone that's building games like real Hum knows, I know you know this. The real trick is to have super wide distribution and then introduce Rarity in a way that's protected by a game design that can build the ecosystem.
01:43:52.768 - 01:44:20.540, Speaker H: So anyways, I think that it's great that people are exploring art and they're experimenting with crossover of community and intersections and interests. But I do think everyone's learning very gradually that you see people in real time asking like oh, this is a problem and how do we solve it. And so people are walking through this path together and they're all walking towards gaming, they just haven't realized it yet. We've all been here, what, for four years, building this and so we're just waiting.
01:44:24.000 - 01:45:31.524, Speaker E: The funny thing is for me, so I bought my first collectibles. My first NFT ever was maybe it was a crypto kitty, but the one I really remember was Super Rare's Art. For some reason that's what really completely transformed my perspective. I think it was the end of 2018 and I bought some art on Super Rare and I was just like, that was it for me. I was hooked because the concept made so much sense. Now I preached art, I preached crypto to a lot of my non crypto friends and no one came near crypto until TOPSHOT because that was what got my social circle to finally have text groups that they actually were active in where we were talking about crypto and NFTs every. So like Rome, what are your thoughts on this, on Topshot's role in bringing these new people into the NFT community and then seeing them migrate to PFPs and how that's going to translate into the further evolution of the space? Tell me, what your thoughts? I mean, I think the profile picture, I have a Board Ape, I think I'm a supporter of all of these projects, but I think they're still pretty small.
01:45:31.524 - 01:46:55.856, Speaker E: They're much more status games for the ultra wealthy than they are anything that can sort of directly translate to millions or hundreds of millions of people. And if you look at even art, like Art Blocks has about 20,000, 19,000 total owners. The only projects that sort of get close to breaking double digits, triple digits, are Z, Axie and TOPSHOT. And it's because they have that funnel that Marguerite is talking about where you can kind of get started without a huge investment and you can do stuff, you can get into habits in a sense. And I think that the profile pictures are today kind of an amazing, sort of an experience for the wealthy and I think that's been in particular the board Apiotcov has pulled it off really well where they're creating so much community value out of the assets, but they're also a hint towards what's going to be coming. I'm sure some of the folks here heard that Twitter is putting in authentication for an know you can kind of say, hey, this is my avatar. And to Margaret's point, I think what the masses will want is more customization, is more just interactivity with their product, maybe earning things for their avatar as things grow.
01:46:55.856 - 01:47:53.088, Speaker E: And that's a big reason why we've been really big fans of Genies and leaned in with the Genie's team, because we think they're taking kind of a Gen Z first approach to saying, well, if we're all going to live in digital worlds and we need digital identities, how do most people want those digital identities to work now? Ultra wealthy, for sure. You want the Picasso on your wall, right? But not that many people can afford that. There's sort of, how do we bridge from here to there? Is going to be really an interesting so, Dylan, I think it's always funny, and you're very much involved in creative and art, and this stuff is in your world. I sometimes find it funny how my friends now talk about art, and it's kind of like it's almost like to the point where we're at a bus stop, they see an AV, oh, look at the art on that bus stop. Anything is now art. Art has become the art. It's really getting spec.
01:47:53.088 - 01:48:10.184, Speaker E: It's really interesting now, people's definition of art like, oh, did you see the art on that camel? It's like, oh, God. What is your thoughts on what this is doing for the art world as well, and the creative world? And is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? What are your thoughts there?
01:48:10.302 - 01:48:50.180, Speaker G: Oh, it's a great think. Obviously, I'm highly biased in the, you know, a significant portion of my net worth is in NFT, but I think the question of what is art usually drives art forward. And regardless of whether we see NFT, art markets crash when a crypto cycle comes, I wouldn't be surprised, right. Sometime the next two years, maybe sooner, quite a bit sooner, we'll probably see a crypto crash. Crypto is a cyclic asset. It's not going to be up and up forever, despite the mania that we're all in right now. And that doesn't mean that it doesn't have significance.
01:48:50.180 - 01:49:52.004, Speaker G: I think there's great significance here, and I think that you have to basically separate the significance of sort of the conceptual from the actual monetary volume that's changing hands. And that's kind of why I think that the term collector is sometimes overused, because there's a lot of speculators in the space that's, okay, speculators are sort of like creating liquidity pools for people to be able to buy this artwork and be able to invest in artists. But I think if you zoom out to just some of the macro trends that are going on, we're going from a physical economy to a digital economy. And that digital economy. People want digital goods because they're living online. Right? And I think that as we are navigating that digital economy, whether it's a profile picture, I've thought that several times, oh, man, profile picture projects are dead. And then I'm always reminded of sort of like, was it the patent office in the early 19 hundreds, 18 hundreds, whatever it was? And they're like, oh, yeah, not sure any more patents will exist.
01:49:52.004 - 01:50:07.772, Speaker G: After some time, we should probably just shut it down. Then you see projects like Port API Club or you see projects like the Noun project where you've got actually, this incredible group of people coming together to be able to buy a Noun every single day.
01:50:07.826 - 01:50:08.488, Speaker A: Contribute the funds.
01:50:08.504 - 01:50:48.700, Speaker G: To a dao and have that dao then be able to vote on what they should do their first act, actually being charitable contribution, which I thought was incredible. And so I think that every time we think that we see the limits of some type of the medium, we're going to see further innovation because we've taken somehow we've created this honeypot for the world's creatives. And they've come to it. And they've realized that there's actually some money there as well, and that for some of them, they can actually subsist off that. And from there, that unblocks their creativity. And I think that Loot is another great example of that. I'm obsessed with it, have been obsessed since it launched.
01:50:48.700 - 01:51:21.568, Speaker G: It's such an exciting project to me because here's an example of rather than having a franchise like Sports or a created universe like Neon District, which are both amazing, right? But instead it's like, let's go world build together. Let's go figure out how as a community, we can create a new world. Which I think really gets the definition of metaverse. No one really knows what metaverse means. It's this collection of loose terms right now. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with decentralization. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the yes and principle of improv.
01:51:21.568 - 01:51:32.810, Speaker G: I'm pretty sure it has to do with building on each other's works and derivative projects. And Loot to me, is right the center of all those things. And so I get very excited about that project and just see what comes from it.
01:51:34.140 - 01:52:10.944, Speaker E: That's awesome. Next driver of growth, I guess. My theory, if I think about the thesis here, it's like I saw we were in the speculation phase with Crypto from 2013 to 18. Then there was the ICO bubble that crashed. The winter hit, shit, companies died, good companies built, and out came DFI. And I think DFI brought utility and an entirely new wave of value to the tokens that were able to sustain that winter, were well funded with great teams, and be able to then rise above and now have a phenomenal utility of kind of rebuilding the financial infrastructure from the ground up. In my perspective.
01:52:10.944 - 01:52:34.172, Speaker E: And Marguerite, you might even say this was farther back, but I feel like we've been in the NFT space since 2018. That's just my view. Maybe it's like 2017 or even 16. And it's been a speculation phase as well. Like, people speculating, buying, selling. The foundational principles are we like to buy dope shit and we want to make money while we do it. And that's kind of a lot of those.
01:52:34.306 - 01:53:36.992, Speaker G: I actually kind of disagree with that. I think it's important that people know there's a corner of the Internet that's like long term collectors that believe that there's a canon being created of NFT art, and that art. Like, for example, I'm a member of Fingerprints Dao, which takes thesis. They're the sort of on chain art that is going to be the sort of native art form for NFTs and Blockchain and their entire philosophy sorry, which one was that? You said Fingerprints Dow and their philosophy is to this is what I started to get really involved. I asked the creator, he had bought an autoglyph that I wanted and I said, hey, can I buy that off of you guys? And he said, sorry, our entire point of view and philosophy. And I was like, sign me up, I want to be as involved in this dow as possible because that was exactly what I was looking for. I do want to just correct that because I think that not everyone is a speculator in the space.
01:53:37.126 - 01:54:10.708, Speaker E: Sure, okay. So that's totally fair, I would say. I guess from my perspective, the broad audience and if you think about most of the buzz and conversation, has a lot to do with speculation. There are people that are deeper. Absolutely. But I think the most driver of use around S NFTs in the short term, in the near term, at least from what I've seen with my networks of people that weren't even crypto, people that are now entering the space, is speculation of price and speculation of value and speculation of long term or short term value. But then I guess my point being here is that we go through this speculation phase just like we did with crypto.
01:54:10.708 - 01:54:32.396, Speaker E: There will be a winter eventually at some point, and out of that I think you come the metaverse, which is the true native, whereas the native home for these assets. But in between that and I think the metaverse is still a ways away. True ways away. What do you think are the nearest term? Next? Innovative drivers of adoption of NFTs. Marguerite, it looks like you're.
01:54:32.428 - 01:55:15.040, Speaker H: Yeah, so I actually might throw this at Dylan. I really believe that there's two spectrums when we think about the spectrum of innovation and what you're seeing, why we might experience winters, because there's a lot to be built still. And on one end we're going to be exploring interactive NFTs and what infrastructure and framework will want for that across all the different applications. You know, what we're going to need from our marketplaces to support that across the different applications to the other side is a no code remixing platforms, which I think Dylan is completely positioned to just knock it out of the park. Everything from his proof of concept with Ethmoji to now his platform with. So I want to know when are we going to have a no code remixing platform?
01:55:15.110 - 01:55:49.796, Speaker G: Dylan well, I don't know about that in terms of when that will, but I'm certainly not building it right now. But I love the idea of remixing and I think actually some examples of that recently, just to call out some projects that I think are really cool here. One that I saw was deafbeef. And Deafbeef has a series of projects and they're basically audiovisual experiments on the blockchain. They have the C code to render the projects in the smart contract. And then they have a series of different artwork. One of them, series three is called Entropy.
01:55:49.796 - 01:56:00.460, Speaker G: And for entropy, whenever it's transferred, the artwork changes and degrades. Kind of like if you have a record vinyl, the more you play it, the more scratchy it gets. It's a similar sort of fashion.
01:56:00.540 - 01:56:00.976, Speaker E: That's cool.
01:56:00.998 - 01:56:57.360, Speaker G: Another one that I thought was really interesting was Blitknots and Blitmaps. And so Blitmaps, basically you had this entire process they used to basically mint on chain the artwork itself. You could do things like compose and translate the color palettes as well as to draw. And then from there you could buy the Blitmaps if you had missed that phase and actually mint what's called a blitz knot, which is sort of the next character in their created universe, also partially on chain. And I think that was also really interesting as a derivative work. The third that I'll point out is kind of similar to both ideas, which is this project that not many people have seen yet called Animal Coloring Book, which is an example of basically you discover the properties of the NFT as you are then minting it and then transferring it. So every time it transfers, it's an additive thing, sort of the opposite of the series.
01:56:57.360 - 01:58:05.140, Speaker G: Example, you have an NFT called Cat and I have some outline of a cat and then I transfer it over to you, Marguerite, and you get the outline of the face and then you transfer it to Roham and he's got the eyes and you transfer to Drew. And the eyes are kind of like googly eyes and it's just really neat because you kind of discover the NFT as it's transferred. And I think one thing that is going to also be really important for NFTs is zero knowledge proofs. I think if you think about remixability composability and also just gameplay, if you are playing World of Warcraft and you have your bag of items, it's really important that people don't know exactly what's in your bag. And zero knowledge proofs, I think you could actually use them in the future. Not saying that we all have figured out exactly how to do this today, but one day we're going to have a world where people can play these games and have items that others do not know they have. And I think that'll be just as important as the status games that people are playing on Twitter today with profile pictures.
01:58:06.120 - 01:59:02.356, Speaker E: Ron, what do you think? What do you think are going to be that's awesome? What do you think are going to be the next major near term drivers of unique adoption? Well, I think you're seeing it kind of across the board and I just want to say it's true that crypto is cyclical and will go through up and down markets, and especially NFTs that rely on a lot of speculative energy will be affected. Gaming historically does really well in sort of recessions of all kinds. Entertainment is something people need through thick and thin. We launched TOPSHOT during a time when nobody cared what NFTs were and people came to it. I mean, admittedly there was an excitement about trading cards, basketball games weren't happening. And so it just kind of tapped into a zeitgeist in a particular way, even back then. But it wasn't related to sort of crypto specifically, nor kind of the markets more generally.
01:59:02.356 - 02:00:23.836, Speaker E: And so I think especially when we go through sort of that cycle, you'll see NFT projects that are much more about the communities they're serving and much less about tapping into a sort of stream of speculative energy in a way to kind of market make and get into, as Dylan was saying. And I think that that'll be good. It'll be a good chance for people to get in at the ground floor. I think that gaming is the sort of driver of adoption for millions of people, other than I think what we're doing in sports is something that TOPSHOT itself can go from a million users to a billion users. NBA fans, we're expanding to three 4 billion sports fans with soccer, et cetera, but kind of seeing what, let's say, projects like Chain Monsters are doing, where they're taking simplified gameplay from things like Pokemon, but giving true ownership, giving trading, creating meta economies around it, that's going to be exciting for people through thick and thin. And then on the flip side, is sort of music. I think it was Chris Dixon that said music is the industry where the biggest gap between sort of what the customer wants and even sort of what the artist is able to do or able to monetize, because there's so many kind of middlemen, there's so many established interests, there's so many kind of red tape in between.
02:00:23.836 - 02:01:08.428, Speaker E: And whether it's sort of projects like sort of record shop or audience or others, I think there's so much opportunity in kind of bringing fans closer to people they care about. And so those are sort of three spaces. So sports, gaming, music are kind of what I get really excited about, totally. And I think it's interesting that I think most people I speak to are incredibly excited about play to earn and the play to earn concept and great gaming. And I still think we're so early in that area. I look at Axie Infinity, it's kind of an OD game to be the game that's like the face of play to earn, in my opinion. But I actually think there's a step before that which is own to earn, so there's like own to earn, and then I think that we get to play to earn.
02:01:08.428 - 02:01:36.164, Speaker E: And I think the own to earn is kind of what we're seeing where DeFi is kind of leaning into the NFT space. And by having certain types of assets, I think music could be the perfect home for the own to earn economy, which is a lot of people are now talking about are you going to get royalties by owning a piece of an NFT that when music is played, you get a percentage of those royalties. What are you guys thoughts on that before we move into playdare?
02:01:36.292 - 02:01:43.320, Speaker G: I think it's super exciting. I mean the idea of NFTs is a productive asset, which is also part of Marguerite's reference to Ethmoji.
02:01:43.400 - 02:01:48.636, Speaker E: Sorry Drew, I said it creates freedom for people to have those passive income streams is so important.
02:01:48.818 - 02:01:49.260, Speaker A: Exactly.
02:01:49.330 - 02:02:44.930, Speaker G: And that was also partially the idea of Ethmoji was the base layers you could have or even just the things you build on top of that, if you made a derivative work, then you would get some income off of the new mint. But yeah, I think that's an very exciting idea. And also just the idea of having some way to have the rights to an artist that you really like. It actually will bootstrap new artists in the ecosystem because basically you're betting on then you're saying, okay, let me go discover indie artists, find the ones that I think I'm going to take that are going to take off, get rights to some of their music, or fractionalized rights to some of their music, of course. And then from there that will actually create income for me if I'm right. And so it enables this sort of class of people that are these super fans of what's next in the music world to actually monetize their passion. And I think that could become really big, really fast.
02:02:44.930 - 02:04:07.028, Speaker G: I also think that just as long as we're talking about other categories of what could come with NFTs, I think we're all still trying to imagine what this metaverse concept can be and how this patchwork of decentralized systems will come together. And no one knows yet, but I think that there will be a world one day that more people are spending time in online. We're already seeing that we're already spending time online, we're just not doing it in a very interesting way. I think that when I grew up, I played Neopets right, and that was like a huge part of my childhood. I think that if you think about the fast forward of that to World of Warcraft, to other MMOs to then okay, games like Dark Forest, which I think are way more entertaining than Axie infinity to me, because that's an example of a complex strategy game that basically incorporates NFTs as game items is built in WebGL on a layer two years and zero knowledge proofs in order to mine portions of the map that you can't see. Otherwise there's so much exploration that can happen here, it's only a matter of time before the first shipwread game comes out with NFTs. But it's also just a matter of time before someone builds a virtual world that actual goods and services will be represented and property will be remembered as more NFTs.
02:04:07.028 - 02:04:13.196, Speaker G: We're already seeing some of that but I think we're going to see it in a different level soon and I can't wait. I'm really excited for what that will be.
02:04:13.298 - 02:05:00.876, Speaker E: So that's making me want to go in a couple of different directions, but I'm going to start here first. Well one, let's talk Play to earn for a quick second because I think there's before I get into the metaverse part of this which I really want to get to, what are your thoughts on the future of work when we think about Play to Earn, like how does it impact the future of work? Because I have some weird philosophical thoughts on what could happen to society if this takes off the way it could. Marguerite, what are your thoughts on I also come from an HR tech, I just sold an HR tech company. So when they think of Play to work, they think of digital transformation. I'm sitting here thinking like, dude, we're all going to be working in the metaverse, that's the future of work. But what is your thoughts on the play to earn and future of work kind of situation?
02:05:01.058 - 02:06:24.128, Speaker H: Yeah, so I think that the challenge that we're facing right now with building out these experiences is Play to Earn is really boughtable unless it is protected by a very strong game design. And so, even in DeFi and even Dark forest, Dark Forest, like it's really a game of who can build the best bot, which is a game, sure, but is that fun for the person that's just trying to participate and walk in and it's a normal casual player? No, that's not fun. Right, so how do we build out experiences online that can engage an abstract human puzzle solving part of our capacity that is different and is not boughtable and that actually is pretty complicated to build those kinds of game designs. So I think that the space is currently exploring what has worked for the gaming industry and for a lot of these problems and protecting economies and we're trying to adopt them also with our blockchain game economies. So with the Play to Earn model honestly games and the likelihood of games failing is gigantic and that's why games, it's really hard for investors to invest in gaming all by themselves. Now we've done this brilliant idea of adding blockchain applications which are also very likely to fail, that have never been built before with games that are also innovative and very likely to fail and everyone's just going to try to figure out what formulas are working. So that's why I think it's totally okay that people like Loot, we're starting very small at a proof of concept.
02:06:24.128 - 02:07:31.228, Speaker H: We're finding the most fundamentally sticky thing about the experience. And then I believe we're going to see projects that are successful from there, get funding because they've proven a sticky formula and they're going to be able to go build a whole concept and game universe around those experiences. So I do feel like right now to iterative building, build fast and fail hard should be everybody's, especially if you're just an engineer and you're just trying to get a proof of concept off the ground. But I don't think it's the right move to go do something crazy ambitious like build your own blockchain ecosystem simultaneous with building a whole new AA game studio, even if you have industry experience on one of those fronts. Roham. I remember when Roham launched Flow and I was like, are you sure that that's a good idea? Anyways, I'm really excited about seeing all these little projects get off the ground because there's so much potential in various ways of so it's great seeing things like Loot and these other projects being incredibly successful and you can see that there's something magical there and the community get behind it.
02:07:31.314 - 02:07:53.252, Speaker E: All right, so before I move on to my next question, I have to let Roham respond to being called Roham. Roham, is it crazy to have building your own blockchain while you're building a game studio, while you're building games and IP and all this other stuff? It was nuts. And we almost weren't able to do it. And don't forget, we also had to build the payment.
02:07:53.306 - 02:07:53.696, Speaker A: Rails.
02:07:53.728 - 02:08:30.940, Speaker E: Right. Dapper wallet today is still the best user experience for crypto payments. And we process over a billion dollars there. And it's fully compliant, fully sort of regulatory, very kind of well lit experience, the kind of thing that the NBA and global brands want to use. That's why Genie's is plugging into Dapper on Flow, because they're going to be bringing the billions of fans of their partners and their artists and all those things. And what are those folks going to do? Go. Download MetaMask.
02:08:30.940 - 02:09:14.620, Speaker E: It's just not going to work. Have to acquire cryptocurrency. Just not going to work. And then when it comes to Flow, when you're looking at Ethereum, you're looking at L, two S, and then other blockchains, there are security trade offs moving off of ETH mainnet, but ETH mainnet is too expensive for most things. And so when Shopify was looking for a blockchain for Shopify partners to be able to make NFTs, they chose Flow. When other Fortune 500s are looking at the kind of network that can support not just the scale or at the cost, but also the user experience, the customer trust, you choose Flow. Flow's got 2 million active wallets right now.
02:09:14.620 - 02:09:53.188, Speaker E: Million of those verified unique users from Dapper, a million of those across the other sort of noncustodial ecosystems. Those are normal people. They're coming to play chain monsters and play NBA TOPSHOT and use record shop and all these. Things they're not coming to, we don't really have yet the kind of DeFi ecosystem that would bring kind of the traders and the speculators, even though that's possible. So was it crazy? Absolutely. But no question we made the right call because now I'm looking at what's happening. Gas wars and Ethereum, we're looking at smart contracts.
02:09:53.188 - 02:11:20.324, Speaker E: We built our own programming language. Cadence was built from the ground up for not just NFTs, but also the kind of smart contracts we need, the more complex kinds of smart contracts that A, we had to write four years ago for CryptoKitties, but B, when you come into Dows, when you come into Composable games, every single step has to be thought of. So we didn't do it lightly, right? Like, I spoke to Vitalik multiple times, we went through every other layer one architect and we spoke to some of the layer two teams, although back then it was Ron. Did you ever consider building a layer two as opposed to going like building a version of a matic for your own instead of that? Look, we weren't interested in saying, let's build a band Aid solution, we're interested in saying, ten years from now, who's building the right trade off space for consumer apps? And no one was and no one is. Like the path people are taking are either splitting things into layer twos, going down the road of charting, reducing decentralization, all of this stuff and flow today isn't everything it'll be in 510 years, but we're very confident it's the right trade off space. Nobody was thinking, oh, we need to write our own Spark contract language. Everybody's thinking, oh, let's use Rust, that's a great idea, or Solidity is fine, it's been around for four years.
02:11:20.324 - 02:12:06.224, Speaker E: We just disagree. Nobody is thinking of rethinking web3. They're saying, well, why not have MetaMask, et cetera, and then just use centralized wallets when you need it? We disagree. We think you need a wallet application interface that lets users take custody of that same wallet, right, cycle keys through it. And it's all of these bits and pieces where we couldn't convince anybody to sort of adopt our approach and we didn't want to just build an appendage to someone else's network. We think that this is the right trade off space and someone's going to eventually figure it out. And so we said, well, might as well build it ourselves, launch it with the NBA bring on board and then blow up, open the gates, right? Let anybody build on top, let anybody host nodes.
02:12:06.224 - 02:12:08.788, Speaker E: And that's the path that's going down.
02:12:08.954 - 02:12:36.444, Speaker G: Just want to add one thing, I'll keep it really short. I think both Roham and Marguerite are correct in different ways here. So Marguerite .1 of her points was, if you want to be a successful gaming company, you need to launch a lot of things, do it really fast, test your concepts and iterate on them. I think it's absolutely true games are a hit business. Rohan's point was that usability matters. You got to do whatever you can to get usability to work, even if it means doing the crazy things.
02:12:36.444 - 02:13:07.364, Speaker G: And I think that we do need more people that are going to do really hard, long term projects in this ecosystem. Dark Forest, for example, is one of those. I was really impressed with them because they integrated a wallet into the gameplay on top of a layer two. Right. And they went and did a lot of UX improvements because they also said MetaMask, no one's going to use it, and that's not the way that the future of gaming is going to look. And so we're just in a stage, and I also from Figma, have that bias. It took five years from going from starting Figma to making our first dime from a customer.
02:13:07.364 - 02:13:28.700, Speaker G: Right. And so these things take time. And I think that if you're working on gaming, maybe try to do these short sprints, but sign up for a long time period and know that it's not all going to work. And if you want to do, like, the large, big project, that's fucking awesome. Go do it and find ways to fund it and use the community that's around you to support you and try to rally those resources.
02:13:29.200 - 02:13:50.516, Speaker E: Okay, so I know we don't have too much time, but I want to hit the metaverse stuff for a quick second. So my big question here, do you think the metaverse takes off? And when I say take off and I know so, Dylan, you actually have kind of opened up the definition of a metaverse in a bunch of directions, but in, I guess, at least the vision in my head, do you think the metaverse takes off pre VR or.
02:13:50.538 - 02:13:52.390, Speaker G: Do we need I think it already has.
02:13:53.480 - 02:13:54.276, Speaker E: Okay?
02:13:54.458 - 02:13:57.216, Speaker G: Look at Roblox. Roblox is a metaverse.
02:13:57.328 - 02:14:00.548, Speaker E: Okay. I guess that's kind of where I'm.
02:14:00.564 - 02:14:14.412, Speaker G: Going with it might not be a metaverse that we like in terms of it being decentralized. It might not be a metaverse we like in terms of know, it's a lot of kids using it. It's not like a lot of adults using it, but I bet a lot of kids really want Roblox instead of dollars right now.
02:14:14.546 - 02:14:25.600, Speaker E: Yeah. So your approach is do you think that VR is even needed for the metaverse to thrive?
02:14:26.980 - 02:14:50.616, Speaker G: I think that VR AR are technologies that are coming and over our lifespans. They'll be just as important as mobile devices or screens. When exactly, I cannot tell you, but I think they will become that, and I think that people are already living online, and I think that the fidelity at which they experience these metaverses will go up.
02:14:50.798 - 02:15:26.950, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess because when I think about this, it's like we're buying assets for a digital world. We're spending more and more time in a digital world. The theory that I have is that eventually our digital world needs to become more immersive to facilitate a truly kind of almost human esque like experience. Marguerite, what is your like? Do you think VR is going to play a big role in gaming and in the driving of adoption of it? Do we have to just wait till Apple decides to throw their hat in the ring? What's your thoughts here?
02:15:27.560 - 02:16:10.210, Speaker H: No, I think the open metaverse is going to think that I think users love collaborating and building and having the tools to participate. And you can't do that and have that same ownership experience in a walled garden. No one wants to go build Facebook's Metaverse. No one's attracted to mean maybe there's a certain user, but I can tell you the broader everyone that wants to build the communities doesn't want to go do Facebook's work for them. And so I think that already a little bit what Dylan said is we're already here. I think that the little experimentation and the collaborative building, I think that is the beginnings of the metaverse. I don't know that there's going to be a definitive moment.
02:16:10.210 - 02:17:06.224, Speaker H: I think there's just going to be intersections of projects that emerge and they just continue stacking on top of each other and then people are going to work on those tech stacks to make different experiences possible and then people are going to have APIs that connect. I think first of that is OpenSea. I think OpenSea is the hub of the metaverse right now. I think the game is inventory management and that's the bottom of the funnel at the moment. And instead of everyone focusing there and you're talking about speculation, for example, Neon District, we have 130,000 asset owners now and it's a free to play game so people can onboard. And with that wide distribution, since it's free and you can just walk right into the game and then we introduce scarcity and people can use their accumulation of the in game currency, Neon, which is not a token, it's just like wow, gold. To buy and participate and compete for these rare assets, that is like for me, we're creating our own universe.
02:17:06.224 - 02:17:44.624, Speaker H: There's definitely an emphasis on creating our universe, but it's a particular intersection and I have no doubt there's going to be overlapping like Ven diagrams of where Neon Districts and our user base participates in other communities. But I do think giving our users tools to help build outside quests help build outside stories have a Star Wars type universe where we drive major narrative experiences, properties create the core economic value, but give the opportunity and the bridges for other side economies to be building off of is going to be like that model for me is basically a microcosm of what I think will be the macro of the metaverse. And I think we are already building the tools and the assets that will be a part of it.
02:17:44.742 - 02:18:35.996, Speaker G: Yeah. One thing I'll add to Marguerite's points she remind me of is just how important distribution is. It's a really boring topic when we're talking about the future, but just if you're building a game, you need distribution and that's a huge channel for you. And so I think that's one of the reasons I'm so excited about things like Loot is because it creates an inherent distribution channel, which is all the holders of Loot, especially as that ecosystem gets built up and people know where to look. When I think about the open metaverse, I think one of the challenges that we have to solve to make it work, which I also heavily subscribe to, like Marguerite, I really want that to happen, versus like having some evil monopolist overlord, which is basically every other metaverse punk fiction, they all have one. And I think what's important is how do we create distribution for people that are creating projects in this open metaverse?
02:18:36.188 - 02:19:02.744, Speaker E: Very cool. Okay, so we only have three minutes left, so I'm going to ask a quick question for each person real quick. Name a project that you're excited about right now. An NFT project. Everyone's got their own little fun projects they're excited about. I'll drop one that I think is pretty cool because you guys just mentioned Loot. There's a project a buddy of mine is involved in building called Geohashes, and I think Geohashes is super interesting because it's also another derivative project.
02:19:02.744 - 02:19:40.324, Speaker E: But they built this derivative project over Google Earth, so anyone that needs to use mapping and locations and proximity, they created this whole really interesting model around a Geohash, encodes a geographic location into like a short string of letters and then you can do whatever you want with that building block. So I thought that was like in the spirit of Loot, I think we're going to see other building blocks like that that are going to come out. And now I'm really excited to see what games and what ways people utilize this stuff. So that was one that I just thought was worth calling out. Dylan, tell me one that you're excited about.
02:19:40.442 - 02:19:44.390, Speaker G: I've already talked a lot about Loot, deaf beef. Others.
02:19:44.940 - 02:19:48.248, Speaker E: Sorry, dylan, is it? D-E-A-F?
02:19:48.414 - 02:20:25.132, Speaker G: Yeah, D-E-A-F-B-E-E-F-I think that's just the potential of on chain media there is really exciting. What I'll talk about instead is just sort of what I'm calling the NFT chain rule, which is basically that a meme's value is proportional to the number of derivatives that are made off of it. And so I think as you're looking at projects, so this is the Meta answer, but as you're looking at projects, I think that the projects that will have the most value are the ones that will ultimately spawn derivatives. And I think that that's one thing to keep in mind as you're looking at different projects.
02:20:25.196 - 02:20:28.116, Speaker E: Do you think the derivatives have value? It's a huge debate about that.
02:20:28.218 - 02:20:33.252, Speaker G: No, I think that actually the derivatives create value. I know, for the thing that they create derivatives on.
02:20:33.306 - 02:20:37.956, Speaker E: I agree with that part. The question is, do you think the derivatives that are created are also valuable.
02:20:38.068 - 02:20:42.084, Speaker G: If they also have derivatives that's well played.
02:20:42.132 - 02:20:44.010, Speaker E: Well played. Marguerite, what do you got?
02:20:44.620 - 02:21:26.964, Speaker H: Yeah, so actually, I'm launching a new interactive NFT in a collaboration with Tim King. He's also known as Illustrator and we made an Interactive NFT. So it's with Beat mixing, taking stems of a famous artist that we were working with for a major brand for a big drop. It's one of their first big brands, first drops and anyways, it's a game also. So as you remix the stem according to how it's supposed to be produced, there's know of course with me making crypto puzzles naturally there's like a crypto puzzle type game remixing. But the fact you can even do this from opensea's asset page directly with Iframe support. And I'm excited about this because of a couple of things.
02:21:26.964 - 02:22:04.084, Speaker H: One Interactive, NFTs and Gaming directly from Asset pages. But then two, the fact that with music and stems, I believe this is a proof of concept. Imagine you could have entire library of stems in which people could use for remixing purposes to create new content and new Interactive NFTs for different experiences. You can have live streams of DJing and having audio like the visualizers that match. And so you could have these NFTs that are showing you've got a DJ streaming or a radio station that's playing. There's so much to play with. So I'm excited because that's kind of like a side project I've been working on and it's dropping in about two.
02:22:04.282 - 02:22:04.644, Speaker C: Cool.
02:22:04.682 - 02:22:43.104, Speaker E: Very cool. Roman Roam, what's excited for you? I already mentioned chain monsters. They just did a million dollar drop last week which went really well. Chain Monsters? Yeah, that's the sort of Pokemon derivative of it. And people are starting to kind of think about, well, what does it mean to build on top of these things? The Dr. Seuss app just went into testing and that's cool because it's mobile first, it's also trading first. So it's less about flipping for high dollar amounts, more about trading and completing sets and then this sort of thing.
02:22:43.104 - 02:23:17.768, Speaker E: So you all should sign up for that. And then as an art platform, I really like Versus, and all of these are on Flow. Versus is sort of totally on Chain. The actual site itself is also serverless and it's a really neat setup because it kind of pits the big whale against the community and it says, well, will the thing become a one of one or will it become more of an addition where multiple people can have access? That's interesting. Those are some of the ones I'm.
02:23:17.774 - 02:23:18.890, Speaker A: Playing around with today.
02:23:19.200 - 02:23:22.670, Speaker E: Awesome. And where can we find you guys what's Twitter handles real quick?
02:23:23.840 - 02:23:28.700, Speaker G: Dylan at Zoink Z-O-I-N-K. Zoink Roham.
02:23:29.040 - 02:23:29.736, Speaker F: I'm boring.
02:23:29.768 - 02:23:33.128, Speaker E: I'm just Rohan. Roham marguerite.
02:23:33.224 - 02:23:35.132, Speaker H: I'm coin underscore artist.
02:23:35.276 - 02:23:35.632, Speaker A: Okay.
02:23:35.686 - 02:23:39.888, Speaker E: And I'm at Drew Austin. Guys, this is a lot of fun cartoon. Thanks for having us. This is great.
02:23:39.974 - 02:23:41.760, Speaker G: Thank you guys. Thanks for having us.
02:23:41.910 - 02:24:00.052, Speaker A: Thanks again for this amazing talk and much for moderating. Drew, this isn't great. Thanks again. See everybody. Take care, everybody. And with that, we are ready to move on to our next talk. And the next talk is going to be about ENS.
02:24:00.052 - 02:24:26.770, Speaker A: A lot of people don't know this, but ENS domains are BRC 720 ones. And there's so much that you can do on top of this thing. And Makoto is here to tell us about the possibilities of ENS and how this fits into the broader identity world in crypto. So without further ado, let's welcome Makoto, and I'll let you take it from here. Hi, Kartek. Thank you for introducing us. And I'll just start now.
02:24:26.770 - 02:24:31.570, Speaker A: Can you hear me okay? Everything's great. Cool.
02:24:33.080 - 02:24:34.390, Speaker E: Let me share.
02:24:38.040 - 02:24:58.696, Speaker A: Okay. May I start? Yeah. Okay. Hello, everybody. So, yeah, this is about ENS. And I just wanted to do a quick introduction. And in Ethereum world we have something called like, Ethereum wallet and address.
02:24:58.696 - 02:25:32.864, Speaker A: So according to in kind of on chain world, I'm known as zero x five S 384227, blah blah blah. But obviously no one remembers. So we have ENS for that. Hence, I have a well known ENS name called Matokun East. Actually, my real name is Makoto, but yeah, in the ECM world, I am Matokun East and I'm a developer ENS team. And I've been working in ENS team since 2018. And today I want to talk about so it was a ground vision.
02:25:32.864 - 02:26:32.376, Speaker A: It was a title my colleague Bradley Put, and he unfortunately have some flight schedule chance so he can't give his ground vision. So this is my interpretation of the ground vision. We as a ENS team, we kind of share the same get because I kind of watched ENS to kind of start and they just kind of flawless. So I wanted to quickly recap how when it came, where we are right now. And also we have a kind of new vision. We used to say ENS heavily borrowed from the name DNS domain name system. So we keep thinking, yeah, we are the kind of ethereum kind of name service, which is almost like a domain name system, but we kind of start realizing that self, realizing that it's actually would be more than that.
02:26:32.376 - 02:27:20.308, Speaker A: So we start telling ourselves as a Web Three username. So I want to kind of start talking about that transition and that journey just started and we need to build a lot of stuff and we also need a lot of help from you guys. So I want to just end my talk with where is the area we have to focus on and how you can help the handful. Beginning back in 2016, this was June 9, in London. So ENS, the idea of ENS was kind of invented from the guy called Nick Johnson. He is a founder of ENS and now he is in New Zealand. But back then he was in London.
02:27:20.308 - 02:28:05.252, Speaker A: And incidentally, I got into Ethereum back in 2016 about the same time as Nick got in. And I went to the Fast Ethereum Meetup back in April. And when I went to the third meetup Nick was actually presenting about ENS. Interestingly. If you look at the June 9 I think this was the time he was about to join from I think he used to work at Google or somewhere. Then he decided to join Ethereum Foundation as a guest developer. And ten days after this the Dow blows up.
02:28:05.252 - 02:28:44.660, Speaker A: So the original Dow who raised like 150,000,000 and it got hacked and the 30% of the east got like drained, that kind of stuff. So his first job was to basically rescue the Ethereum. But at this point he had no idea what's coming. We need that. And at that time, I don't know how many people were there when Ethereum that time, but we had that vision. That vision was the world computer. That whole things about ethereum.
02:28:44.660 - 02:30:13.308, Speaker A: We are the one who kind of compute all the things, do something and we also have some idea of kind of triangular system that Ethereum is a computer then you also need a storage system which was Swarm. Swarm is basically similar to very similar to IPFS for the distributed storage system but it integrates natively to Ethereum. And also there's another thing called whisper which was a network system layer which is not really actively developed but I think status is taking over the idea and doing something called WASO. So as part of the Swarm because Swarm had that kind of content ID which is a hash of basically the content you want to upload image or stuff then obviously they had an issue also that had the issue of very machine friendly but human unfriendly name. So when it started I think he was having the idea of ENS and the first use case was let's use it there. So that was very starting point. But yeah, at that time he just joined the Ethereum Foundation and he was kind of doing on his side of while maintaining the Go Ethereum client and about year later made a force.
02:30:13.308 - 02:31:03.756, Speaker A: Actually, I think he initially tried to launch in 14 March, which is a pi day, but as soon as he launched he hit a bug. So he had to retreat and he did another launch back in May. Made a force that's easy to remember. May the force be with you. So that was the actual launch. And on this kind of tweet he says I think Kartik said yeah, ENS is one there NFT project and did actually warm the kind of oldest non fungible token may 2007. So this was kind of months before even the crypt punks was born and the standard seven to one didn't even exist.
02:31:03.756 - 02:31:38.928, Speaker A: And during that time also it was a kind of peak of so called ICO initial coin offering and there's lots of company was doing, raising lots of money and it was the first time ethereum as a community hit the network spike that whenever people do, I think brave did the browser, did their token launch, I think about the same time. And during that time there was a huge spike. So what we did, what Nick did kind of interestingly is like because name based on that I think sadden.
02:31:38.964 - 02:31:39.550, Speaker B: Like.
02:31:41.360 - 02:32:50.012, Speaker A: I think if it's a hash of the name or something, he basically kind of spread the name with this mint period over the three months. So if some names can be minted auctioned on this day, whereas the other name is this day because spread over the three months just so that we can prevent people just jumping into one specific moment. So I think it was quite innovative in a way, even it was like four years ago, but he was already thinking about how to make sure it's not going to collude the network. So I wish more NFT projects actually do something like that. So some names are actually auctioned off during the even before the cryptunks was minted. And yeah, 180,000 names were auctioned over three months. And another interesting thing is it was a so called bickery auction that fast highest bidder paid the second highest bid.
02:32:50.012 - 02:33:29.548, Speaker A: So some of the name people the highest bid was East Phoenix, which was over someone bid for like 200,000 east. It's a humongous amount, but actually no one bid as high as it. So I think that person only paid like 0.1 east or something. Whereas something like a dark market, open market, it was more like many people bid. So that's actually the price they acquired, which was about 20,000. It was a lot, but in total I think one hundred and sixty eight k at that time it was about 50 million.
02:33:29.548 - 02:34:08.904, Speaker A: Now it's probably like over half a billion. It's quite a lot of money. But the thing is I think it was the first time people kind of saw the opportunity similar to the kind of.com boom like people just squat on it, just holding it. And it was designed to make it easier because it was more of the locked system. So you put a deposit and you can only while there is a deposit there, but if you want to release the name, you get the money back. And the reason behind he did it is that because he was a kind of interior registrar, he didn't know how all things works.
02:34:08.904 - 02:34:42.836, Speaker A: So he wanted to make it temporary. And if something happens, worst case scenario, people can get the reason name and just get the money back. So I think it was more of a safety mechanism. That was the initial design. But again, that was auction was through like seven days auction. So it was very difficult to basically for every name, even after the three months period, every time people wants to buy the new name, people had to wait like five days to kind of bid and then rebuild that kind of stuff. So that was really difficult.
02:34:42.836 - 02:35:38.120, Speaker A: So in 2019 after two years, we actually did this so called permanent registrar where instead of depositing the money to kind of get the name, we decided to more similar to how DNS naming system works. Like you pay fixed amount for certain year. So that's kind of 2019 and then that was basically two years ago. But even after you transitioned, it was kind of gross. It wasn't really growing. So this is a growth of the mastery registration period is that it was going somewhere between thousand names till 5000 names a month, except the spike of the November. That's when we released a short names which was between three to six characters.
02:35:38.120 - 02:36:24.688, Speaker A: In 2020 there's a D five summer and in 2021 we became NFD summer and people realized actually ENS is also NFD. And also another thing is when people start seeing ENS name on kind of OpenSea and stuff, people start realizing, oh, this is not just normal like JPEG, he has some utility. So we finally start getting kind of momentum and this is where we are right now. Let me go to next slide. Yes. So from domain to web3 username. So I just briefly mentioned it initially.
02:36:24.688 - 02:36:54.256, Speaker A: So ENS started as kind of some of the UTT functionality to help the vision of our computer. And the architecture is heavily kind of inspired by the DNS. So we have a kind of so called domain name system. It has a name but it has a hierarchy. So ETH is a top level domain. I have Matokun East and you can also have a notion called subdomains. So these are very similar to how DNS internet domain works.
02:36:54.256 - 02:37:55.940, Speaker A: But one thing I later found out, I think when we were all in the Twitter space about talking about OGNs and then Brantley, my colleague was asking to nick, how did you come up with this called reverse record? Is that instead so normal name you map Matokun ETH to jerks one two, three. But there's a notion for reverse record if you purchase ETH name and if you go passing after registration is done, it actually prompts you to set something called reverse record where you can basically select your primary name which associated to your ethereum address. That's why we call it Rebuild. So in this example, I have multiple names. Like I am Matokin Es or Matokin Gitcoin East. And I can associate which name represents my same address by doing that. Now, if you go to somewhere like Uniswap.
02:37:55.940 - 02:38:48.052, Speaker A: So if you connect the wallet to that DAP, they use a reverse lookup to see which name represents this ethereum address. And it shows to you. And this is a convenient way, especially if you have multiple addresses you don't want to mix up which address you're trying to do. Swap tokens and stuff that's useful to you. That's what Nick said yeah, he just kind of added as an afterthought so because he kind of added afterthought it's kind of actually quite hard. It was one of the hardest things to set after you purchased ENS. And even now, I think still only somewhere between 20% to 30% of people names have rebust records set.
02:38:48.052 - 02:39:25.536, Speaker A: So not everybody using it. But for people who uses it, it's very convenient that you can almost using as a login system. And it's not just uniswap. For example OpenSea OpenSea you can actually look up your name using your but like if you look at the artist page in this case it's a people pleaser. So people pleaser picked people pleaser as a username in Openc. But if you go to different NFT platform it might not be necessarily available. So for example, my Facebook username and a Twitter username not necessarily the same.
02:39:25.536 - 02:40:43.268, Speaker A: A gitcoin is the only one I was able to secure makoto, because I was aldi. But you can't have a kind of consistent username whereas if some NFT marketplace connects with same address you kind of share the same address then it suddenly becomes a portable kind of platform agnostic username. That's where people start discovering. And it even become more useful when about three months ago, OpenSea integrated this reverse record feature so that now if you go to ESA, scan the C transaction, you can start seeing that from where to who it's basically sending transaction and this is the Esascan is the address of Pleaser Dao, which is formed around initially purchasing people. Pleasers uniswap art but now they formed its own dow and you can see that jamie and Andy are doing something. It's almost seeing you showing your own chain history. That's now really becoming evictors.
02:40:43.268 - 02:41:33.944, Speaker A: And one thing we didn't really expect people do is people started putting into not just for web3 system, but start putting web two system like Twitter. Nick is one of the first person who did this because that was his creation. Then I think that was about 2019 or 20. Someone like Vitalik started doing and now so many people, such ETH on Twitter, there's so many people doing it. It's just becoming it doesn't really prove anything, but it's almost showing your kind of, hey, I walk, live and breathing ethereum world. People start becoming just a convenient method to start tying as your ethereum identity. That's where it start coming.
02:41:33.944 - 02:42:00.640, Speaker A: Like, this is not something I'm just guessing what Nick was thinking. I don't think Nick really did expect that this is going to happen. And another thing, what's happening is we have in the structure. So this is a smart contract of the ENS system. You don't need to. Know everything. So ENS is like huge phone book like where there's a name and there's a phone number kind of stuff.
02:42:00.640 - 02:43:32.920, Speaker A: But rather than that this is called registry. But the registry doesn't actually hold your same address but it also just has a pointer to something called resolver where you can kind of customize what to show and how it show. And primarily when we started majority of the Use case was to show Ethereum address. But you can actually set something else such as IPFS Content Hash or like Swan Content Hash which I show as the primary primary use. Case and also just Brownlee's ENS Page and he basically puts everything and his entire life is in basically on chain and that's how he is using tax record. And then with this base construct I think about a couple of months ago that was Zapper study showing the profile photo to their website but it's great but I think I don't know exactly where they store this NFT association information. So we just said okay, why don't we just the text record doesn't stop you can actually put any key and value but we just said yeah, let's come up with a format so you can share if you store once in ENS you can basically should be able to reuse in different DApps.
02:43:32.920 - 02:44:40.432, Speaker A: So we just integrate a very basic version. So this is if you look at the text record page on your ENS name and if you say avatar and you can put like it says EIP one five five column one is a net chain ID. So if it's main net it's one, if it's polygon one three seven account then you pick it's either ERC seven two one or 1155. Then the contract is basically contract address is basically equivalent to collection and the 2430 is a token ID. By putting this kind of format we as basically this ENS manager page can actually go into chain and to see not only to see which image it represents but the programmer can also program to see who owns it. And if it's owned by actually this ENS name I can even put the flag to say this NFD is actually owned by this ENS name owner. So I can put something like owner label.
02:44:40.432 - 02:45:50.968, Speaker A: So this is another thing we started adding we didn't even have it until three months ago but we started doing it and I think there are a couple of team already started creating avatar JS library and he's going through so many DApps to integrate. I can see that this is coming to many DApps very soon. So this is a kind of alpha leak burntley did I think about two, three weeks ago. So we are almost transitioning into almost like a social network or basically showing your online on chain identity. This is kind of new vision. We start realizing not just that we had it back in 2016, it's very hard to predict what's going to be four or five years afterward but we kind of watched how user are using ENS and this is the transition we're going so far. Okay, by the way, this is a mockup.
02:45:50.968 - 02:47:17.200, Speaker A: We still have a month away to actually implement that but not just the UI change we need we need still a lot more so this I mentioned, this was the left side was the kind of vision in Nick 2016 too. This is a vision of the new kind of direction we are going into five years later but 1D huddle which didn't really exist at that time but now exists, is a scaling issue and how do we need to tackle and how you can help solving this problem? I'm going to spend next probably two, three minutes. So this is how much gas you have to spend to register ENS name. And until d five summer hit, it was literally one of the cheapest NFT to buy. That registration only cost $5 and it used to cost only less than one dollars on gas to register. But now east price went ten X and the gas price went like 5000 X. So now you start seeing that when gas is cheap probably it still costs like 20 $30 whilst of east on gas and when gas is very expensive it's going to go 100.
02:47:17.200 - 02:47:54.832, Speaker A: I saw that a few weeks ago when root and all of a sudden went nuts. There's a 6000 gas way and I saw that someone spent about $2,000 just on gas. That's crazy. So we kind of have to sort it out. And the obvious solution is going to basically L2. And we have nick proposed some framework called during, which is kind of general purpose of chain data, which we mechanism. And there's a diagram.
02:47:54.832 - 02:48:56.532, Speaker A: But I wouldn't explain this because you don't probably understand if you don't understand the architecture of ENS. But the visual representation is that what we are thinking is like so registering ETH name will remain. On layer one very long time and we are not at the status choose which layer two is a winner so that we should move but what we want to do is we want you to pick the layer two you want to have your data associated and we have a way I mentioned resolver. So resolver is something another smart contract to decide how to resolve your name. And currently, it's just directory returning data. But what we want to do with this jury model is let resolver point to some web services where it returns the data. And most of the L2 relies a security on L One.
02:48:56.532 - 02:50:14.864, Speaker A: That means there's a way to prove the data on L2 to be in L One, to be able to verify because they anchored all the data back in L One. So we know there's a way to do it. So what we want to do is if you have matokundo is you want to change the resolver to points to specific L2 and retrieve the data there. But this is still, I think highly advanced thing. What we really want to see is we want DApps to point their resolver to their choice of L2. So like if it's uniswap, uniswap says let's say, hey, we issued a subdomain to all the users on optimism so that user don't have to buy the name, especially the new user don't have to buy the registered name on L One, but rather just user subdomains under their favorite app. And if Dy DX wants to issue subdomain they are already in stockware so let's issue the subdomain stockware and we have a ways to people update data on L2 of their choice and they should know how to do it because they already use the app.
02:50:14.864 - 02:50:59.000, Speaker A: But we have a unified way for people who's not on L2. If you own a luke app, for example food Dy DX, we came up with ways to basically read the data through this during framework without you switching MetaMask to change the network all the time. So this is kind of idea stage. We have a proof of concept. So that means how DAP adopt this new layer two system and integrate it becomes very key. And we have currently have 286 DApps who already does some level of integration. But we really want them to start paying attention.
02:50:59.000 - 02:52:33.916, Speaker A: What's happening? What we want to go to L2, and the easiest way if you manage one of these DApps or if you are building something for its online Hackerson after, I think week after actually following Day of the East Global Hackerson, we are having ENS workshop for inviting the builder and the developers to talk about all these technical aspects. And I think we'd like to invite some people who are hacking and who hacked with ENS to kind of present in the end of what you achieved and all this stuff. So if you are a builder or if you're hacking something right now, please apply for ENS online workshop. But this talk is aimed for non technical people. So I am aware that not everybody fits for this workshop but one thing you could do is for example example is a crypt level page have a crypt punks page and which has now linked to resolve who owns the punks and it shows the ENS name. And I heard from the disco conversation that there is some community member in Crypt punks disco channel. They kept pushing to the level of guys to integrate and after he pushed so much, they finally added it and now it's getting one of the most traffic to our site.
02:52:33.916 - 02:53:44.004, Speaker A: So what you could do is just if you have a favorite app and if you are the Dao member and if you are active, please propose to integrate with ENS and also if you are not an active member the fast community to maybe join could be the ENS Discord Channel as well. So we were very bad of community management, we were very small team but now Alicia is joined the ENS team and she's doing fantastic job like managing all the Discord members. So maybe should pop into ENS Discord channel, just say hi and just show off your Twitter with your ETH name. So that's probably the easiest thing you can do to help ENS to kind of get more intuitive with different DApps and it becomes more useful as a username. It's really username. It's only become useful if everybody else use the same web, represent their username and we hope that ENS becomes ENS workshop. You can check out more detail on the medium page.
02:53:44.004 - 02:54:24.060, Speaker A: Please follow ENS domains twitter and join Disco and just join our website. Thank you very much. Thank you so much, makoto. We don't have a lot of time for too many questions but just two recurring things that showed up and I'll try to see if we can get them sorted quickly. First one is for the layer two integration. What does the timeline look like for people to be able to make their ans changes on the L two? Could you talk a little bit more about that? Yeah, it's still early to be honest. So we already have a kind of walking example in Optimism.
02:54:24.060 - 02:56:02.920, Speaker A: Nick did it just like on its own and I just was working on porting that example using the Jirin framework. So that's there but yeah, still I think for Optimism they were also doing the network relaunch, right? So I think it's not ready to deploy immediately, so it's not nest few months to be honest. And also it's not just the platform support but also we need to have a support on something like ESA JS web library and the MetaMask or the tools. So again, I think we want to make Next workshop to be the place where people can discuss about what other DApps are ready to adopt even too soon. Another sort of one big theme here is that from the diagram you showed around how the layer one ENS can let people spawn different usernames on different layer twos, does that mean people can have a different username across different ENS on layer two? Or does that mean like the identity will still be preserved and the same username maps into things that we want to? Yeah. Currently ENS is non fungible, whether it's ELC 7211. So if you have one name, for example, if you have one name in arbitrary points to different address and another name in polygon or like optimism pointed to different address, you can't basically look it up.
02:56:02.920 - 02:56:44.044, Speaker A: What we want to do is I think that one we are still thinking but what we are kind of thinking is probably there are two ways if it's non ETH name. One thing we didn't discuss is you can now use.com or XYZ using so called DNSc Oracle. That one. Basically, you can prove resolver on L one dictates which name it points to. So whichever, like if this resolver says this name, I'm using optimism. Whatever the names resolved in optimism becomes a canonical one.
02:56:44.044 - 02:57:06.832, Speaker A: So you may have something else if you do that, and if you then say, oh, actually I'll do. In arbitrary, it may have the same name on different chains, but it's the L one which decide which ones points to. So it's always one. Yeah. Great. Well, hopefully that clarified the questions from the audience. And Makoto, thanks again for doing this talk and being part of the summit.
02:57:06.832 - 02:57:22.570, Speaker A: Thank you. Up next, we have our last talk of the day and we're going to go into lessons learned from doing Dark Forests and talking about it will be upsheets. So whenever you're ready, feel free to get started.
02:57:24.300 - 02:57:29.196, Speaker I: Hi, Karthiks, thanks so much for having me. Can I share my screen?
02:57:29.378 - 02:57:31.340, Speaker A: You should be able to. Awesome.
02:57:31.410 - 02:57:32.428, Speaker I: Can you see this?
02:57:32.594 - 02:57:33.308, Speaker C: Yes.
02:57:33.474 - 02:58:06.132, Speaker I: Perfect. Cool. So thanks again to ETH Global for having me. For this year's ETH online. I'm gub sheep. I am one of the creators of Dark Forest, and today I'm going to be presenting on lessons from fully on chain gaming. So, first, for a little bit of context about what my team works on, we're building Dark Forest, which is a procedurally generated MMO, real time strategy built with zkSNARKs for the EVM.
02:58:06.132 - 02:58:49.300, Speaker I: So currently Dark Forest runs on XDI. Previously it's run on the Robson test network. It's a game that can be launched onto any EVM compatible blockchain. And basically how you can think of Dark Forest is it is a game that is fully on chain. So all of the data, all of the state, all of the game logic is on chain, can be deployed by anybody. And as such, it is a quote unquote, infinitely hackable strategy game where players can write scripts or interoperable contracts or any other modifications that they might desire during the course of gameplay. So, yeah, like we mentioned, all the logic runs on the EVM.
02:58:49.300 - 02:59:21.996, Speaker I: Formerly we ran on Robson, now we run on XDI. During dark forest rounds. We have a whitelist system and we generally see about 2500 players or so during these rounds. And over the course of the weeks that we run these monthly rounds, we'll see these players consume more gas than all of Ethereum mainnet combined, actually. So another impetus for scalability if we haven't seen enough arguments yet already today. And a little bit about myself. I'm Gubsheep, I work on Dark Forest more broadly.
02:59:21.996 - 03:00:36.176, Speaker I: I work on applied zero knowledge, crypto research and development, and I also work on a number of educational and ecodev projects. Okay, so to dive into crypto native games, we first have to answer the question of why build games on the blockchain at all? And I'm sure many people here are probably familiar with this experience. But when I talk about DApps in general or games on blockchains or whatever other applications people today are interested in building on blockchains. The thing that I always want to be wary of and the thing that I see in a lot of projects is that basically a decentralized version of something is oftentimes just like a centralized version, but worse. And we really want to lean into the unique affordances of decentralization without just taking purely many of the obvious disadvantages that come with building on a blockchain. Blockchains are slow, they're difficult to program on, they have certain scalability limits, all of these different things. So make an argument for why we care about building games on the blockchain.
03:00:36.176 - 03:01:36.696, Speaker I: And this argument sort of has three parts. So I think that there's three answers that we've seen over the last couple of years to why crypto games are interesting or important. There's a broke answer, there's a woke answer, and there is finally a bespoke answer. So the broke answer is that people are interested in building games on the blockchain because it is easier to build Ponzi schemes or Scams. So I think in a lot of the early days of Ethereum we saw applications like if people are familiar with FOMO three D from Two thousand and seventeen, two thousand and eighteen, kind of the last bull run. FOMO 3d was sort of a tongue in cheek, pyramid scheme, exit scam application where people would basically put in ether into a big pot, and every time you put ether into this pot, a timer would increase and the timer is ticking down. And if the timer hits zero, I e.
03:01:36.696 - 03:02:35.870, Speaker I: No one has put in any contribution in the last five blocks or something like that. Then the whole pot would go to the last person who had put ether into the pot. And I think that these sorts of quote unquote games are what characterize a lot of the early experimentation around crypto games. And FOMO 3D was, in my opinion, one of the better ones, honestly. But a lot of these things were just like straight up like pyramid schemes or Scams or whatever else and I think it left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths. And so I'm glad that the space has moved away from this sort of thing being like the dominant narrative in crypto gaming, but obviously there's a lot of lessons to be learned from this. So the woke answer to why build crypto games, which I think is more the dominant narrative today, is that with crypto when you build applications you have APIs into the native concept of money or value.
03:02:35.870 - 03:03:58.920, Speaker I: So that means that it is really easy to make, for example, your game assets be worth real money and consequently it makes it much easier to build digital worlds where your actions have quote unquote real or economic consequences. So for example, if you lose a particular item or you manage to find a particular item or something like that, then that has economic consequences for you as a player, which kind of makes the game experience more immersive. So a lot of collectibles projects I think fall into this category. So I think everybody pretty much is aware of has seen CryptoPunks, we've seen games like CryptoKitties and these days Axio Infinity is drawing a lot of attention. And also we're seeing a lot of games like for example SkyWeaver or Gods Unchained where you've got these trading card games where gameplay happens off chain, but the ownership layer of the game lives on chain. So cards are ERC, 721 Tokens and ownership is recorded on chain and these can be transacted on marketplaces like Openc. So yeah, like we mentioned, the fact that you have access to these money native APIs so easily in crypto games means that you can build these games with real consequences or economic consequences.
03:03:58.920 - 03:04:44.144, Speaker I: And that's really exciting for two reasons. This does two things that traditional games cannot really tap into. The first is that because there's something at stake, the game is more immersive. immersivity is a concept which you can measure along a bunch of different dynamics. One is like how graphically immersive is a game. Another is does the game feel like something where you've really got something at stake? And I think crypto uniquely enables that dimension. And the second thing that's really powerful is that the fact that these are economic universes means that it might be easier to incentive align the community members of a game or the players and the devs.
03:04:44.144 - 03:05:52.280, Speaker I: So when everybody can share in the ownership of a protocol, then everybody is incentive aligned to grow the community and build out the community. Unfortunately, I think that the current state of crypto native gaming and a lot of the games that subscribe to this thesis is incomplete. I think that a lot of crypto games currently are more speculative asset classes really than they are games in that either the gameplay is very limited or the game itself is just not very fun. Or most of the attention that's being driven to these games is surrounding the financial value of the assets rather than sort of the intrinsic value of owning these assets in a digital world. So I saw a great tweet where basically someone claimed crypto games will never be sustainable as long as the market around the game is more fun than the game itself. And I think this is super true. I think that another way in which games that subscribe to this currently dominant thesis is incomplete is that many of these games aren't fully crypto games.
03:05:52.280 - 03:07:31.176, Speaker I: So for example, ownership is on chain, but game logic or identity know account logic or permissioning is off chain. So Avsa tweeted this out earlier this summer, but basically he noted that this was a really popular game that had banned a large bot farm and Avsa was sort of calling into question like, wait a second, is it really a crypto game? Is it really a blockchain game? If there is someone who can ban people or if there's someone who can prevent people from playing the game, I think it comes into conflict with a lot of the ethos around permissionlessness and censorship resistance that's so important to blockchains, not just for ideological reasons, but also for practical reasons. So the third part of the crypto gaming thesis that I want to talk about is the bespoke reason for building crypto games. I think that the most exciting reason to build crypto games is that building a game on a blockchain enables something that we call permissionlessness or sorry, permissionless interoperability. Rather than explaining what this means abstractly, I want to show a few examples from Dark Forest of things that we have seen players do that are uniquely possible because Dark Forest is a quote unquote crypto native game. So one thing that emerged very early on was that we saw players were scripting very heavily in order to gain advantage in the game. And one of the interesting consequences of building a game, or honestly, any application on the blockchain is that blockchain applications are client agnostic.
03:07:31.176 - 03:08:42.240, Speaker I: In other words, you can talk to the blockchain, you can hit a function in a smart contract from a script that you write, from a default or vanilla web client provided by the developers, from a modified client that you have forked, from the developer provided client. You can do any of these things. You can go into your Chrome dev tools and you can just spin up a transaction, sign it with a private key that you're storing locally or anywhere, and send that off to the blockchain. Access to the game cannot be gated. And therefore what that means is that players can actually build out things like automations or bots or even AIS as first class features into the game. So early on, we released a plugin system that allowed players to essentially take snippets of JavaScript code and inject those snippets into their client. And from this we saw players build like a ton of interesting utilities from data visualization tools to remote snarkers, which allow you to prove these zero knowledge proofs that are at the center of darkforce on web servers that are user maintained and offline.
03:08:42.240 - 03:09:43.780, Speaker I: We saw players writing even very complex AIS to assist them in playing the game when they were offline or to allow them to play at a higher level. And all of these things have kind of become first class features of the game, these snippets that are passed around between the community and that's added a whole nother dimension to the gameplay experience. We've even seen some folks fork or write entirely from scratch new clients. So for example, Giorgios and Kobe did a lot of work to put together a Dark Forest Rust client that allows players to play Dark Forest in the terminal. And there's a lot of sort of performance boosts to being able to do this, especially because you're able to prove your Snarks with a different tool stack that's actually a lot more efficient. And one thing that Geordios and Kobe had to do was actually do some reconciliation work between these two different snark tool stacks. The first that's meant to be used in browser, and the second that's meant to be used inside like a rust web server.
03:09:43.780 - 03:11:08.400, Speaker I: And this was super cool to see and something that is much harder to achieve in a traditional game with a canonical developer provided client. Another central concept to Dark Forest is the idea of there's a cryptographic fog of war in the universe that you uncover via something that's pretty similar to proof of work mining. But we saw some players come out with GPU miners for playing Dark Forest, which was also really incredible to see. And I think the step function that we saw in the last couple of months that really changed the game and really opened the community's eyes to, I think, what's possible with these permissionlessly interoperable crypto games is building new features on top of Dark Forest as well in a way that fundamentally is not possible with traditional centralized games. So as an example, because Dark Forest is a smart contract, anybody can deploy a smart contract, an auxiliary smart contract, onto the blockchain that talks to the core smart contract. And essentially these auxiliary contracts can look like things like Escrow contracts or marketplaces or player corporations or anything else. In this case.
03:11:08.400 - 03:12:29.252, Speaker I: The very first example of this that we saw from a team called Project Sophon was Project SOFON built a broadcast marketplace which would essentially allow you to trade information with other players via a third party contract that talked to the core Dark Force contract. So you can kind of imagine someone uploading a simple Escrow smart contract that says anybody who deposits one ETH into this contract will cause the contract to programmatically trigger a release of some resource from my Dark Forest planet to your Dark Forest planet. And then what a third party developer can do is they can write a plugin that essentially exposes a UI for connecting to this Escrow contract and share that plugin around, or they can provide a third party client that other people can use. And what we essentially see here is that players have come in and they've written a new feature for the game without any input whatsoever from the developers. Contrast this with a traditional centralized game where if you wanted to add something like a trade feature, there's pretty much no way for this to be done except through the core developers. So if JAGX wants to add peer to peer trading in RuneScape, then they have to write a data transformation on their proprietary data stores that live in their web servers. Then they've got to write API routes that will trigger these data transformations.
03:12:29.252 - 03:13:42.450, Speaker I: And then in the canonical RuneScape client they've got to write like a UI component that's a button that's hooked into their APIs, those API routes that are running on their web servers. There's no way for player like players can do so much more in a decentralized game compared to in the case where JAGX or Blizzard or whatever else owns the stack from end to end. So we also saw, for example, a bunch of different marketplaces pop up in the last round of Dark Forest where again, these were entirely player made. They were not built with any input from the core devs. And we think that this is a very early example of some of the richness or complexity that we might be able to see once players can actually impact the land that they're playing on. This was taken from, this is like a little mock up from a presentation that someone in the Dark Forest team gave internally recently. But you could imagine a world where someday game objectives or even totally new resources or even nested games are plugins that anybody can install in the game, where logic is run in these smart contracts that are maintained by the community or by players of the game itself.
03:13:42.450 - 03:14:52.836, Speaker I: Whether it's like game modes and objectives or competitions or we've got here like oil and Uranium resource plugin or something like that. Those are things that can live in auxiliary smart contracts outside of the core smart contracts deployed by the core devs. And I think the last thing that I'll tease here is there is another game that we have been collaborating with coming out from Ludins on Twitter who's building a ZK dungeon game. And this is something that we're really excited about because we think it's going to take a lot of these ZK mechanics and interoperability mechanics to the next level. So keep an eye out for DK Dungeon and the Ludens account on Twitter. So now that we've covered those three reasons for building crypto native games, it's finally time to answer the question like what is a crypto native game? We've been tossing that term around a lot, so let's actually get to something that looks more like a definition to us. A crypto native game is a game that is maximally on chain and that can maximally leverage the unique affordances of the blockchain.
03:14:52.836 - 03:15:52.376, Speaker I: So this means that the source of truth for game data is on the blockchain. The game logic and the game rules are implemented via smart contracts. The game is developed in accordance with open ecosystem and open source principles. The game is client agnostic and the game embraces real world digital value. So we think that this is a superset of what is currently going on with a lot of the efforts that we're seeing in crypto gaming right now to also provide a few negative examples, things that we don't consider to be crypto native games under. This definition are things like a mobile shooter game with a crypto wallet integration or like a trading card game where C 721 NFTs but all the gameplay and the battles happen off chain. And this example is kind of funny to me, especially for just looking back at DeFi summer DeFi apps that have a playful skin or are very gamified or have a lot of emojis for all of these categories of applications.
03:15:52.376 - 03:17:11.140, Speaker I: We think that this isn't to say that only crypto native games can be successful commercially or artistically, but we do think that crypto native games are the most interesting and important to look at, to understand the full potential of blockchain for building digital worlds and to build a picture of where the space is going. So that's the what the why is something that we've sort of answered by example from some of the previous slides. Just to lay it out explicitly, the reason that we think crypto native gaming is exciting is because it enables permissionless interoperability. And that means that players can build the game experience, not just the core devs. Beyond just being able to build on top of crypto native games, it also means that multiple different crypto native games can have strong interoperability mechanics between them. So other games can hook into your game to share assets, identity systems, reputation systems, mechanics and more, without needing to talk to a support team or a BD team or anything like that. So for example, imagine if you could take your sword from World of Warcraft and take it with you into the RuneScape universe or something like that.
03:17:11.140 - 03:18:16.010, Speaker I: Currently that would require some sort of integrations effort between JAGX and Blizzard. But if ZK Dungeon wanted to hook into the Dark Forest Artifacts contract, that's as simple as just saying, you know, anybody can take their Dark Forest pyramid and deposit it into their ZK Dungeon dungeon heart. And if they do that, that powers up all of their units in their ZK Dungeon. And that means that these crypto native game assets become almost these real, physical, tangible goods that you can pick up and carry around with you throughout the ecosystem of these crypto native worlds. So in short, there's all sorts of things that you can build when a game is crypto native. From marketplaces to dows to nested games on top of or inside of games to new resources and mechanics, automations, alternate clients, interoperable mechanics, shared reputation systems. And I think that for all the hype around the M word lately, if you're looking for what might eventually seed the metaverse, I think crypto native games are an interesting place to look.
03:18:16.010 - 03:19:03.432, Speaker I: There's still a very long way to go to realize the full potential of permissionless interoperability in games. For one thing, scalability is a huge bottleneck. So right now, Dark Force is in a private whitelisted beta where we allow a couple thousand users at a time onto the game. This is for scalability reasons because current blockchains and even side chains plus roll ups can't support more than thousands to tens of thousands of users. How do we get to a place where crypto native gaming can be mainstream and can support hundreds of thousands or millions of users? That's an open question. Developer experience is an open problem. If we care about interoperability, then we care about it not in the theoretical or abstract sense, we care about it in the practical sense.
03:19:03.432 - 03:20:28.870, Speaker I: We want people to actually be able to build these marketplaces on top without it being a huge headache. So that means that there's a lot of developer tools and infrastructure that needs to be built out all sorts of these public goods that will be required to sustain this ecosystem. It's also going to be important to find more developers who are able to program comfortably with Solidity or with the ZK tool stacks that we think are going to be important for building out a lot of these next generation apps. And there's so far to go in terms of understanding like application usability, accessibility, design patterns, all of these things necessary to really make crypto native games usable for a mainstream person who isn't a crypto enthusiast. As a baseline, we think that all of those things are currently being worked on and a number of them are quote unquote, just engineering problems. But one of the biggest open problems that we think will be necessary to unlock the full potential of crypto native games is ZK technology and more advanced crypto. So Dark Forest itself is made possible by ZK Snarks because ZK Snarks enable the cryptographic fog of War, which is a really central mechanic in Dark Forest as a strategy game.
03:20:28.870 - 03:21:30.440, Speaker I: But Snarks are in fact a very general purpose tool that can be used to unlock all sorts of new game mechanics that aren't currently possible on chain today. So for example, this is a slide from a presentation we gave a couple of days ago. But one thing that zkSNARKs can be used for is to enable rich procedural generation algorithms essentially executed or verified on chain. So if you wanted to build a decentralized Minecraft, then a decentralized Minecraft analog. So a fully on chain procedurally generated very rich three dimensional sandbox world. What you might do is you might start by taking a procedural generation algorithm like Perlin Noise and putting that inside of a ZK snark and then putting that ZK snark inside of your crypto game. And we actually do have in both ZK Dungeon and Dark Forest very primitive examples of procedural generation algorithms that are now implemented in ZK circuits.
03:21:30.440 - 03:23:09.400, Speaker I: Another example of a place where ZK snarks are very important is in allowing things like card games or private asset inventories in MMO games. So one of the tricky things about card games in decentralized settings, whether that be a blockchain or a state channel or whatever else, is that a lot of the operations involved in playing a card game are things that naively seem impossible on a decentralized system. So, for example, like randomly and privately drawing a card in a way that is uncheatable seems very hard on a system where all applications have totally transparent data layers. But we've been working on some constructions and we have a few proof of concept implementations out of different card game mechanics where you can essentially use ZK Snarks to privately and randomly draw cards, for example, from a shuffled deck. This is also interesting because ZK snarks actually allow you to go one level further than commit reveal schemes in terms of both usability as well as what is fundamentally possible. But yeah, all of this basically points to we believe that games are a part of a larger ecosystem and that games are actually where we're likely to find the frontier of application research and development. For those of you who saw Vitalik's talk at ECC a couple of months ago, one thing that Vitalik mentioned was that today, sort of the major production use case of Ethereum is finance.
03:23:09.400 - 03:24:19.368, Speaker I: And a lot of times we're seeing that a lot of the application level work being done on Ethereum or these decentralized systems is applications that are simply iterating on or permuting different mechanics or primitives that we already know how to use. So I think the example that Vitalik gave was something like people are building tokens on yields that allow you to tokenize the yield captured by yield tokens or whatever. And we think that to really unlock the next generation of Ethereum applications, whether that be games or coordination mechanisms or Dows or whatever else, we're going to need this sort of new technology that's going to allow us to fundamentally move the needle on what is possible to do inside decentralized applications. So yeah, that's pretty much it for this talk. If you are interested in getting in touch, Darkforce is hiring. You can check out a hiring announcement on the Darkforce blog. One thing that we're going to announce soon as well, which we'll just give a little preview of here, is that we're forming a new research and development foundation to support application level research and development into the next generation of DApps.
03:24:19.368 - 03:24:56.088, Speaker I: And if you're more broadly curious about or interested in working with us on ZK research and development, you can email me at gubsheep at zero xpark.org. My DMs are also open. I'm pretty active on Twitter. And also check out Ludens who is the developer behind who is one of the developers behind the ZK Dungeon game. Ivan, who is the lead developer of Dark Forest, Twitter and ETH University, which is some of the educational initiatives that we support. That's about it. Thanks so much for having me and yeah, I'll pass it to you.
03:24:56.094 - 03:25:34.230, Speaker A: Karthik, thank you so much for that awesome list of things to do and not to or how to prepare for this. We'll just do one question. I think I may have asked you this a variation of this in the past, but given the nature of how these things work under the hood, how do you kind of think about or balance programmability to game versus kind of making it fun for the person? Like what would you see bots competing with bots and sort of drive out all the people who aren't doing playing a game for fun or do you think they'll just section off into a separate sort of subcommittee or group or universe and play those games somewhere else?
03:25:34.700 - 03:26:11.728, Speaker I: Yeah, this is a great question. Definitely still an open question in our head. There are a couple of different approaches here. One approach is basically that we encourage all the players to and we try to bake it into the culture of the community that knowledge and tools is meant to be shared. This means a couple of things. One is lowering the barrier to entry, to building these automations and tools and providing players with building blocks which they can construct bots or other things out of. And this means clean APIs or whatever else.
03:26:11.728 - 03:27:39.180, Speaker I: The other is encouraging players who are very active and trying to reward players who are active in open sourcing their work and making it accessible for new players and creating those touch points like an easy to use plugin system so that there can be sort of a level playing field. This also has a dual effect of making Dark Forest something of an educational program for its players where people can steadily onboard, depending on how deeply they want to go into the game, they can go deeper and deeper into playing with the programmability of the game. So I think another possible outcome here is that if you're building a strategy game, you want to build a game with a fair amount of strategic depth to the point where chess was not boughtable for many, many millennia. It's a game where you've really got limited resources and it takes strategy and intelligence in order to be a good chess player. Similarly here with RTS games there is some degree to which bots can help you, but ultimately naive strategies are still going to be beaten out by players who are playing manually and have a deeper understanding of the strategic landscape of the game. So in fact, a lot of the top players of Dark Forest are still primarily manual players or not developers. And I think that what we're evolving towards is sort of like a human AI hybrid competitive gameplay style towards the top ends of Dark Forest.
03:27:40.980 - 03:28:07.576, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense and also, I guess to maybe just sort of think about how things are evolving in NFTs overall. People are really going into derivatives of kind of games and NFTs overall and sort of branching up into their own sub communities too. So as things kind of get either more heated or complex or complicated. I do think people will just self select into zoning into their own world.
03:28:07.758 - 03:28:39.810, Speaker I: Exactly. Yeah. And I think that we're already starting to see it's becoming difficult to place highly in Dark Forest without being a part of a player dow, whether that's a group of people sharing a multi SIG or sharing a burner wallet private key, or who have some more advanced smart contract infrastructure, and then you can start seeing specialization. Like, this person is responsible for building out the automation and bot tooling. This person's responsible for piloting the account during this time zone. This person is responsible for negotiations and diplomacy. So that's been really exciting to watch as well.
03:28:40.820 - 03:28:51.270, Speaker A: And maybe just one last question before we end. From what you just said, is that in line with what you wanted it to be, or is that just you were just kind of talking about what's happened so far.
03:28:51.800 - 03:29:53.400, Speaker I: Yeah. I think for the Dark Forest team, we've always speculated that some of these directions might be possible. But really it's up to and we want to make this true as much as possible, that it's up to the players in the community to see what third party tools or what additions to the game dictate the gameplay experience. I would say obviously, it's hard to measure this quantitatively, but I would guess that more than 50% of a top player's Dark Forest experience actually now lives in actions that are going through third party code rather than the Dark Forest core client or contracts themselves. So for us, it's really about creating that room for experimentation and trusting that a community of players who know currently at least culturally aligned and maybe even someday economically aligned, will have better ideas than just us. And we can try to provide an unoppinionated base layer with just enough creative direction and just enough to play with that, players can run wild with their imaginations.
03:29:55.500 - 03:30:04.536, Speaker A: That's amazing. Well, with that, I want to thank you so much for doing this amazing talk, and I think one day we'll definitely get you to play this game live on one of these talks.
03:30:04.648 - 03:30:06.604, Speaker I: Yeah, maybe a hackathon or something like.
03:30:06.642 - 03:30:11.640, Speaker A: Around don't do it justice. Awesome.
03:30:11.810 - 03:30:13.372, Speaker I: Well, thanks, Karthik.
03:30:13.516 - 03:30:55.756, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Cupsheet all right, with that, we are ready to close off today's NFT and Creator Summit. I want to thank everybody who stuck around and asked questions and engaged with us on the chat. We had so many amazing talks and speakers and questions come in from the audience and also want to give a special shout out to everybody who reached out to us last week about giving feedback on the new eGlobal TV design. We got a lot of bugs still to fix, but we're slowly working on them. One of the harder pieces here is that we can only test these things on production when Real Time Summit is going on, because a lot of these are latency and race condition related bugs that only happen when a few hundred users are watching in real time. But we're slowly working on this thing.
03:30:55.756 - 03:31:18.400, Speaker A: So thanks again for everybody with that feedback, and hope you are enjoying some of your new profile photos. So with that, we're going to sign off, and we'll see you next Thursday for the Ave Grant staO Summit, and then next Friday for our Dow and Governance Summit. In the meantime, check us out on Twitter and we'll see everybody who was participating at the hackathon on Discord. Take care, everybody. Bye.
