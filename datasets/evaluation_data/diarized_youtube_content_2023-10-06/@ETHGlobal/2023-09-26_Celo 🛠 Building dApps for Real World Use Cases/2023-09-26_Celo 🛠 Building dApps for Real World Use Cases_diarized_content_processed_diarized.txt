00:00:07.770 - 00:00:22.346, Speaker A: Hi everybody. My name is Eric Nakagawa. I'm from the Cela Blockchain Cela Foundation. Sorry. And I helped to lead the developer relations team. So excited to be here at our third youth global hackathon. First, let's talk a little bit about Celo.
00:00:22.346 - 00:00:56.718, Speaker A: In case you don't know how many people don't know about cell right now, how many have never heard of it? One, two, three. Okay, cool. Cello is a project that started a couple years back and we really want to talk today about helping build DApps to solve real world problems. I'm here with the team myself, Anna Daniel. We are at the very bright yellow booth in the main stage area. So today I'm going to talk about what Celo is, what's the future for the project. Jump straight into bounties because a lot of people want to know what those bounties are.
00:00:56.718 - 00:01:33.530, Speaker A: I'm going to show a new project. Very excited to talk about this project and then go into a little bit more detail on the additional bounties. If you have any questions, I will try to speed through these to answer questions, but if I don't get to that, come see us first. Again. What is cello? We look at Cello as a place to build with purpose and we want to build for all. And what we mean by that is truly just like everybody here trying to build for the entire world. The difference with Celo is we started several years back, launched the token in a carbon neutral manner.
00:01:33.530 - 00:02:14.646, Speaker A: Back before it was popular, but now everybody's doing it and we're very happy to hear that. We were launched back on Earth Day and there have been several products that have launched on Celo involving things like UBI. This is where everybody gets a little bit of some tokens every single day they come in and claim it. Projects running that right now on Celo are called impact market and good dollar. There's also the concept of natural capital backed currencies, so people locking up parts of a forest, things like that. A lot of this stuff has been built on Sello, and if you're looking to build a company that touches these things, it's a great place to get started. Some of the features sello is an L one.
00:02:14.646 - 00:02:45.970, Speaker A: We recently had a proposal on the forum to convert to an L two. And what that means, it's very complicated. But really making that change makes a lot of sense considering when Cello launched, if was still proof of work. When Solo launched was proof of stake and it's been EVM compatible. But it would be great to come back home to the theorem community. A lot of things that were built also were around mobile first. So when Cello first launched, one of the pitches was sort of like a crypto venmo.
00:02:45.970 - 00:03:39.422, Speaker A: And I think we've evolved past that point where everybody has a mobile device, everybody's using all sorts of mobile wallets. And so the Sello team also built some technology around phone number mapping. So one of the great features that I like about building on Celo is I may not know your wallet, but if I know your phone number, I can in many cases escrow some funds or I can send it to a phone number to be transferred to you at some point when you connect the phone number. Other features to think about, quick, finality, can do high throughput, but everybody says that I think we can handle quite a large bit. And I'll share this near the middle part of my presentation. You can also pay with your transaction fees and stablecoins. So if you have, let's say you are sending some tokens to a phone number and you send them a stablecoin like CUSD, they can pay for gas with that CUSD, not require the sello based token.
00:03:39.422 - 00:04:18.222, Speaker A: So it's a lot of good things for, again, helping people get started. Like many projects, decentralized, community governed, we actually have a hard fork happening on I'll talk about this in a little bit, happening in a couple of days and it's going to make every transaction fully carbon negative. So, very excited about that kind of stuff. And if you're interested in more of these things, feel free to take a look@sello.org. So, yeah, we're looking to talk about an L One. Changing from L One to L2 is a very big, very big leap. But again, the time is right.
00:04:18.222 - 00:05:02.982, Speaker A: I think the examples I made around phone numbers, escrowing and all that is great. Ultralight clients, also a really big opportunity. And with the shift to L2, a lot of this needs to be discussed in the community and if you're a part of it, you're welcome to share your opinions. Recently, the Polygon team posted their proposal, polygon ZK, just to be specific, posted their proposal in the forum, sharing their thoughts on how cell l Two could transpire. And it's actually pretty exciting to see more people getting involved. So a little bit more, why would you build on the project? Lots of people building, using it, lots of wallets. There are lots of organizations driving, keeping the project kind of focused on the core values.
00:05:02.982 - 00:05:46.970, Speaker A: I had mentioned things like carbon offsets, we can go a little bit more detailed there. And then there's tons of projects, lots of a or is a very large ecosystem of people building. I would say we need a little yellow circle there for ETH Global New York in case any of you are building on sello this hackathon, but excited to see the community grow. Lots of different projects building on Celo. Some of these are projects that we've either partnered with or working with that you may know. And there's also a lot of businesses that partner with Celo to reach as many people as possible. So very excited about that in terms of ecosystem and refi, regenerative, finance.
00:05:46.970 - 00:06:39.050, Speaker A: A lot of the development that people have done, have tried to bring on things like trying to bring carbon offsets in, trying to bring regenerative finance in. And if you're interested in this path, let's talk. One project is called Climate Collective which is a funding mechanism to help people or projects that are building in that space raise the funding and capital that they need to grow a team. As I mentioned earlier, Ultragreen is our upcoming hard fork. There was this project called ultrasound money. Everybody's inspired by other projects but we launched Ultragreen Money and that keeps track of how much of the offsets and on Tuesday the actual switch goes on and every transaction from that point on will be offsetting through either toucan or carbon path. So very excited about these things.
00:06:39.050 - 00:07:27.450, Speaker A: And again, something to think about. One of the interesting things with this change is there is actually an 80% of the gas is going to be burnt and then 20% is going to be put into offsets. So it's like I'm no economist, but a deflationary model is very intriguing for many reasons and I think having the carbon offsets as a part of it will do really, really well, especially with some of the new launches that just have come up. If you're here, you're a developer, you're a product person, marketing coming up with ideas and you want to get your idea out there. There's a lot of partners you can be using to launch your project. We have infura Lava Quicknode and then if there's projects that you want to utilize, take a look at Impact Market Good Dollar. There's also cross chain messaging, so Hyperlane shout out to them.
00:07:27.450 - 00:08:16.438, Speaker A: They also have a bounty in case you are trying to stack and I don't know if any of the other cross chain folks are here. There's also Chainlink Live on Solo and a couple other Oracles depending on what features that you need. In terms of stablecoins, you can utilize CUSD, Euro, Real and if you're looking for DeFi, we have Uniswap and Sushi swap several other options. In terms of wallets, there is the Valora which was built by some teams that helped to build the protocol and then launch the wallet. There's MetaMask of course, you just add it into your browser. Your wallet very easy if you're looking for Explorer as you're building ether scan is on Sello, but it's called Celloscan. So take a look at Celloscan or the nativeexplorer Sello.org
00:08:16.438 - 00:08:53.438, Speaker A: which is built on BlockScout. So running into some of the bounties which I think most of the time should be spent on, we're going to be offering three top prizes. We're looking for the best projects that align a lot with what I showed earlier. So if your ideas are kind of there and you want to nudge it a little bit, this is a great chance for you to win a potential prize. And then we're also adding another bounty on top of this, which is around building for real world use cases. And I'm going to showcase Minipay in a second. If you're also looking at building for account third, web has launched and deployed their SDKs for testnet.
00:08:53.438 - 00:09:11.760, Speaker A: And so happy to help you folks there. So quickly, I want to talk about Minipay. It's a really exciting project launched by Opera. And if you're building for a railroad example, this is a bounty that you should sign up for. I'm going to play a quick video. This was announced just last week. So super exciting stuff.
00:09:11.760 - 00:09:17.270, Speaker A: Anyway, there's some audio if you all can play it.
00:09:19.080 - 00:09:36.340, Speaker B: Biscuit. Biscuit. Biscuit. Biscuit. Biscuit. Biscuit.
00:09:44.560 - 00:10:05.296, Speaker A: Cool. How many of the people here have heard of Opera browser? Very cool. So the great thing about the Opera Mini browser is actually a lot of traction in Africa. So large number of users in Africa. I'll try to skip this, sorry. So let's run through some of these benefits. So, super simple wallet built on Android.
00:10:05.296 - 00:10:31.372, Speaker A: I got an Android phone. Got an Android phone right here. They're rolling out to users right now. And it's primarily focused on payments. And so, I don't know, when I was getting prepared for my slides, I was thinking, how do I get people excited about this huge opportunity for building for several million people about to be in this wallet? And if that gets you excited, come chat with us. But I hopefully don't need to connect all the dots for you. There's a lot of really good opportunity.
00:10:31.372 - 00:10:59.284, Speaker A: The wallet is self custody. Transaction fees are very low, as you see here. NGN is Nigerian currency that they're using for folks who are in Nigeria. And then they also provide those folks access to stablecoins. So it can be helpful for people that are trying to decide what to do with their money. They also do Opera team, not us. This is not Sello foundation or the sellox system.
00:10:59.284 - 00:11:10.730, Speaker A: This is the Opera team also provides some free mobiles sorry, some free mobile data, which is very helpful for folks who in some regions, depending on where you live or where you're from, it can be very expensive to do.
00:11:13.820 - 00:11:14.136, Speaker B: To.
00:11:14.158 - 00:11:39.200, Speaker A: Visit lots of websites or heavy websites. So they help to subsidize that. There's also mobile notifications. And so as you're building for your application, think about like, what would I want to do to push alert to, I don't know, 20,000 of my DAP users think that way, and you have a really powerful opportunity. So that's the project. It's called minipay. You can actually download the beta from the App Store right now.
00:11:39.200 - 00:12:19.832, Speaker A: And when we're looking for projects, ideas that you folks may have that fall into these categories, if they do, I think you have a strong chance of winning a bounty. Projects like personal finance, stablecoin yield. I am not an accountant or lawyer, so you need to do your own homework. There merchants B, two B, or just using things like if you had a very simple user interface that had like a couple of buttons, I don't know, let's say one or two, what could you get people to do to help them try out your D five protocol? And finally, or a little bit more detail. How about a gift card idea, a grab app? Something that kind of puts everything all in one place. Someone's going to build it. It could be you, it could be payment control for families.
00:12:19.832 - 00:12:59.932, Speaker A: So I've got kids, so maybe I want them to do maybe they want to buy something. But I'm like, I would give you a loan, you have to pay me back. I'm that kind of dad, I guess. And then what about payment splitting amongst friends? Microwork is a very big opportunity for folks to do things. It could be virtual work, it could be in person real life work, keeping track of things around assets or expense approvals and things like that. Some of these things may seem more businessy, but there's a very big opportunity again, because of the size of people that are coming in. So one project I came up with, again, I didn't talk to the lawyers, so don't get mad at me, but I built this project and I'm going to open, I'm just putting it up online.
00:12:59.932 - 00:13:41.412, Speaker A: It's built off of our very simple to build DAP framework called Cellocomposer. And it's really simple. The idea is people can just play, put their name in, a little bit of money is set aside, and then at some point in the future, using a Provably or Verifiably Provable randomization function, they could win. So I'm going to quickly switch to that just to show this. Let's see, first off, let me show you minipay. So this is my wallet and and here's my obviously, I've been working on it. Here's my DAP.
00:13:41.412 - 00:14:11.552, Speaker A: Super simple. It's a very simple wagme wrapper, so it's not that hard. I just have the concept of allowing people to play the game within. And if you want access to this, this is a beta feature. So in the discovery page there's a test dev section. So I'm going to be testing this today for a live demo, because that's always exciting. So I'm going to run both of the projects at the same place.
00:14:11.552 - 00:14:42.430, Speaker A: And the concept is, the way I want this to work is people from their phone. I need to, of course, improve the user interface here, but I want them to just be able to tap and play. So I'm going to connect my wallet here, very straightforward. I'll chip in a bit and this should update to, I don't know, 40 something, 41.41 cello. That's the prize. And then in a perfect world, this will update, but maybe it won't today.
00:14:42.430 - 00:15:02.480, Speaker A: This project is meant to be just an example of cello composer. Cello composer is a great way to get started really quickly. Got hard hat integrated. It's actually a fork of Scaffold, but built for cello and added a bunch of features around mobile development. Oh my God. Updated. So this is a quick project I wanted to show you folks.
00:15:02.480 - 00:15:23.400, Speaker A: And this is a link to the project. I'll show a link to the project in case you folks want to actually check it out. Oh, here it is. So super easy. Come see me if you actually want to play with it. And if you're interested in actually building for Minipay, getting started on the project. Thank you.
00:15:23.400 - 00:15:44.608, Speaker A: If you're interested in building for the project, this is the one to oh, so here's some of the notes. So, yeah, one of the things is with Minipay, you want to hide your connect wallet. Yeah. What about all the other wallets, right? Yeah. Just imagine if you got rid of that, how much easier it would be if you just started with your wallet. So that's some of the simple things, and it's not that hard to do some checks. If you're interested in Minipay, scan this.
00:15:44.608 - 00:16:11.690, Speaker A: You'll get invited to a WhatsApp group. And then I'll onboard you folks very quickly into the building for Minipay. And I actually think if this hackathon isn't the time you build for it, this is a great opportunity. But even if you build a small thing, imagine if you could deploy it to several million users very soon. Seller composer. You can go to our docs sello.org. Here's another link just to sell a composer itself.
00:16:11.690 - 00:16:42.884, Speaker A: I will talk briefly. I'm going to run through these. You can find everything on Docs Sello.org. Just go sell a composer. But if you want to build for account abstraction, again, think about if you had access to millions of folks all over the world and you wanted to build something that made it easy to onboard account abstraction makes a lot of sense. We've worked with third web to support their SDKs. I won't run through all these just because I'm running out of time, but quite easy to add in the just jumping straight to here.
00:16:42.884 - 00:17:20.300, Speaker A: Quite easy to add in a kind of traction with cello composer. Again, it's just like Scaffold, but updated for the cello community. And if there's other projects, other projects that are available on the cello network that you folks may be interested in using. This is our third hackathon we've been at. So we know that you folks are going to try to select every single box. Here's some of our friends, and please look at their work for the Bounties. How are we going to judge it? If you're building from Minipay and you have access to that, and you can put your app inside that and show it to us, check for me if you have AA working on Alpha Horace testnet it'll work.
00:17:20.300 - 00:17:49.540, Speaker A: I think that will count. You get extra points if you run from on Minipay. Not every feature is available, so it's still beta and then need to see your contract deployed in Alpha. Horace follows all the rest of the ETH global rules and just come demo it to our section. If you need tokens, this is our testnet address for the Faucet. If you need Mainet tokens, come see me, Anna or Daniel, and we'll give you a little bit to get started, because exchanges take a long time. So that's it from me.
00:17:49.540 - 00:17:53.330, Speaker A: My name is Eric. Excited to see you folks. Build on sello and thank you.
