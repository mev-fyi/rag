00:00:03.480 - 00:00:05.790, Speaker A: It's okay. The awkward pause is good.
00:00:08.800 - 00:00:19.564, Speaker B: I mean, we could just always just power through the awkward pause, but then the one time we do, it's going to be the time that didn't end up working. Murphy's Law will be applied, right?
00:00:19.602 - 00:00:38.870, Speaker A: Yeah, always there. Very close. Okay, we're good.
00:00:39.240 - 00:01:16.640, Speaker B: All right, let's get this thing started then. Awesome. Well, first of all, really excited to have heart here from the Uma team. We've had Uma as a sponsor of our events for now a very long time, and they've been a huge supporter of ours. No matter if that's us starting hack money from scratch or just kind of our typical in person events, they've been kind of a mainstay and we're very thankful for their support. And of course, it's been amazing to watch them grow as a company and as a protocol over all these years as well. So, yeah, long story short, very happy to have you here, Hart, and excited to be chatting and having this nice AMA conversation.
00:01:17.860 - 00:01:40.760, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks, Jacob. I mean, it goes without saying that it's been really amazing to watch you guys, you and Kartik and Andrew and your whole team grow the and you know, it's funny, man. I'm not a hackathoner guy. I've never really been a hackathon or guy before. But these events, the in person events were like, energetic, man. They're cool.
00:01:40.760 - 00:01:52.140, Speaker A: And I think it's been pretty wild to watch you guys try to bring some of that same energy in a different format right to online events during COVID times. So it's great to talk to you as always.
00:01:52.290 - 00:02:23.050, Speaker B: Appreciate it, man. Awesome. So, yeah, so I like to start these people who have watched some of these now or are getting used to the formula. I'd love to start by kind of chatting a bit before huma right. Before you may and before you were working on what you're doing now. Would love to kind of get an idea of sort of like, where do what did you first start working on and what were sort of the first things that you started your career on and would love to kind of know a little bit more about that journey, that process, from getting to where you started to eventually founding Uma and working on that project.
00:02:24.540 - 00:03:11.344, Speaker A: Yeah, man. So I started in Toronto, like you, I'm a Canadian as well, and I went to high school there and I went to university in the States and studied computer science because I've been a computer nerd for a long time. And then actually you'll find this funny and it maybe has something a little bit to do with some of the ETH and crypto stuff. When I graduated from university, I wanted to get a job in technology in New York City. And there was no tech scene at that time in New York, like, none whatsoever. And so I needed to get a job with a big company to get me a visa and the banks are the only ones that were hiring. And then I got hired by Goldman Sachs, which I never expected and ended up working not in technology but in their front office as a bond trader.
00:03:11.344 - 00:04:22.328, Speaker A: So I traded interest rate swaps and government bonds for eight years, sitting beside my co founder Alison for five of those eight years and this was through the financial cris and I did all this crazy finance shit that I never expected to do and so that got me deep into finance and how markets work. And then I left in 2013 to start a fintech company called Openfolio which was sort of this it was an interesting play to try to aggregate data around how people invested to help use this aggregated data set to help people make better investment decisions. And what was really interesting about that is we could actually see that people made all the same mistakes. They day traded too much, they speculated they should have just been long term investors. And it was an interesting thing that got acquired by a company in 2017 and left me free to work in crypto which is what I should have done all along, but left me free to work in crypto and that's been really fun. And again, because I have a finance background and I knew crypto stuff from early on. In 2013, I shouldn't have started open Folio.
00:04:22.328 - 00:04:47.910, Speaker A: I should have started a crypto company. But I've been following it for a while. And the thing that's been really cool is taking all of my finance knowledge along with Allison's and applying it to helping the Ethereum community mainly understand financial concepts and how to build financial products here. So long answer.
00:04:48.280 - 00:05:21.250, Speaker B: Awesome. No, the long answers are what I'm looking for, so that's perfect. So you mentioned you should have started your crypto startup instead of Openfolio. I guess obviously Openfolio worked out pretty well so I mean that's not to say that didn't go well but what was sort of your AHA moment on crypto then? It seems like it happened pretty early. When did you realize that, oh, this is actually something really cool that I should spend at least some portion of my time and now almost all your time in when did it click for you? And then what was that click?
00:05:22.420 - 00:06:23.092, Speaker A: The click I think is so I look at economics as like the study of human decisions, like how do you compel somebody to make a decision? And then I look at crypto as really kind of being this way where you can program incentive structures and to me that's kind of where things clicked, where I love the idea of programming things, programming logic, I think that's really cool. But nothing has really allowed you to program incentive structures or program economic incentives the way crypto has. And when that kind of clicked and that by the way, give a shout out to Ethereum bitcoin didn't make that click ethereum. Made that click ethereum. Once you got to smart contracts and you could actually program these things this is kind of wild where it's like, okay, cool. I can straight up program incentive structures for actors, individuals, participants to do things. Yeah, right.
00:06:23.146 - 00:06:44.830, Speaker B: And I guess as a key to that is have those structures be publicly available and visible and trustless and et cetera, et cetera. Because you can do some level of this in Web Two, but not in a way that is as obviously transparent. Right. There's just no way that you can actually have this guarantee. There's always going to be a shred of doubt, if you will.
00:06:46.000 - 00:07:14.724, Speaker A: Exactly. Makes a lot of sense. No, totally. You could imagine you create your own centralized fake money in a Web Two service and you build to some extent you can think of in app gaming or inapp monetary systems as kind of a version of this. Right. But it could never really get big because Zynga or whatever, you could lose all your wealth, I think. Doesn't fatalik tell a story, right.
00:07:14.724 - 00:07:23.430, Speaker A: Where it's like he had his favorite video game and then all of a sudden they changed the rules of it and he was heartbroken or there's some story like that. Right?
00:07:23.960 - 00:07:26.440, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. It's ringing a bell.
00:07:27.020 - 00:07:54.290, Speaker A: Yeah, there's some story like that. So I think that's part of it. It needs to be something that's solid and credible and that can't be taken away from you. Which is why crypto is core to this. The other way I kind of look at it to kind of go slightly like philosophical for a second. Incentive structures can be kind of thought of as contracts. Like you're contracts that compel people to do things.
00:07:54.290 - 00:08:37.672, Speaker A: And financial products, you can go to this whole DeFi thing. Financial products, all the traditional financial products we look at are really contracts. They're financial contracts that say, hey, some financial service provider is going to pay you Jacob this thing if these events happen. Think of insurance or even the stocks. You have a brokerage account or whatever. The problem with that enforcement mechanism is that it's all rooted in your legal infrastructure. So you Jacob, have pretty good access to how those contracts and incentive structures can be written because you're in Canada and it's pretty credible like legal system and that's not true globally.
00:08:37.672 - 00:09:10.570, Speaker A: Right. And it's also siloed like the contracts that can get written to compel you to do things in Canada are actually different than the contracts in the US or in South Africa or wherever you want to pick. And so this idea of using crypto to build a completely alternative enforcement mechanism for how you enforce incentive structures I think is super compelling. And then it's like a global internet native incentive structure for how you compel incentives. I think that's really cool.
00:09:10.940 - 00:09:43.264, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. And I think we're probably going to talk about how that works on the actual uma, platform in a I mean, obviously that's like what we're leading up towards here. But I guess kind know the step back here would be okay. So to kind of restate where we, you know, you've sort of been thinking a lot, you worked a lot in markets with Allison, actually your co founder as well. Started something new, then exited that new thing and then like you said, now had time to think about crypto and blockchain. Right.
00:09:43.264 - 00:10:02.010, Speaker B: We love kind of know a little bit more about that time. Obviously there was a bit of time where probably things were in flux and you weren't totally sure on what to do. How did you settle on uma, like what was that thought process? Was there kind of anything else you tried in between that might not show up on your LinkedIn? But I'd love to just kind of get an idea of how you came to this idea.
00:10:04.960 - 00:11:15.712, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. So the thought process here, actually I was trying to be relatively structured about it, where this crypto stuff was really interesting to me. It really is a natural infrastructure for finance. So to me kind of like I have had this DFI thesis for a while since call it mid to early 2017. Finance just seems like where energy should be focused on. And some people might disagree with me on this, but I think it makes sense given that crypto is all about economics. And I started thinking through what were the inventions, what's the history of inventions in traditional finance that led to the well developed financial system we have today in the fiat world and what do the crypto equivalents look like? And you start to get when you go down that process, you have like lending, right? So compound and ave are really important stepping stones and then you start to have ideas of, okay, like trading derivatives or futures or that type of thing.
00:11:15.712 - 00:12:38.110, Speaker A: And this is very core to kind of what my background was of interest rate swaps and derivatives and how that could work. And so the first thing that we wrote was a paper about how to build total return swaps. So basically how to create a contract that would let you create an exchange value transfer risk bet on things. And our thought process actually here was, okay, swaps and these types of over the counter contracts, bespoke contracts make a lot of sense in traditional finance, but in crypto people like tokens, this ERC, 20 standard is really useful and really valuable. So let's look at trying to tokenize these things. And then in the process of trying to design really secure and flexible and extendable tokens, we came across like the Oracle problem, right? Like, hey, we need to know whether these things are enforced or not. And we spent a lot of time thinking through methodologies on how to approach this and we kind of came up this idea that's very much parallels traditional contracts of, like, priceless contracts, where we try to use the Oracle as rarely as possible.
00:12:38.110 - 00:13:08.368, Speaker A: It's sort of this dispute resolution layer, which we can talk more about too. So that's kind of the history of how we ended up where we are. And now we've basically got this platform that lets us create synthetic assets. Right now, expiring synthetic assets you can make out of the box for anything pricelessly. And Jacob to zoom out. I think it's kind of wild. Like, right now, we've got more than $40 million secured pricelessly with no Oracle calls whatsoever.
00:13:08.368 - 00:13:26.904, Speaker A: Like, there'll be two Oracle calls in a three month period. And I think that's really interesting, which we could talk about. And then we've got a perpetual design that's going to be ready in a couple of months of how to create perpetual, not expiring synthetic tokens. And we're trying to make it really easy to have people spin up synthetic assets. And I'll stop there, right?
00:13:26.942 - 00:14:18.876, Speaker B: Yeah. This Priceless piece is like, I do want to dig into because I think it's know one of the things that I think in a way is quite unique to your design. And of course, really, I think novel implementation to enable these types of like we had actually the Teller AMA, where we talked actually quite a lot about the Oracle problem and how kind of their approach to solving it. And they actually hinted at your approach as mean, maybe would love to kind of get an idea about how do these priceless contracts work and sort of like, how can we apply these even if you want to. First of all, how does it work and what does that look like? And then maybe a quick kind of note about how you can use these in kind of any project that you're building. Right. I think it's just key to kind of pull that back to how this talk connects to the event, if you will.
00:14:18.876 - 00:14:25.260, Speaker B: But, yeah, I would love to kind of know a little bit around kind of the actual thought process behind priceless contracts.
00:14:26.160 - 00:14:58.196, Speaker A: Yeah. So first thing to note is the actual Oracle problem can be contentious. Right. There's lots of ways to solve this. And what we mean by the Oracle problem, I'm going to define it as this, where we need to know some bit of information happening off the blockchain. So let's call it in the real world, we need that to be reported to the blockchain. And so to just abstract away, let's forget about how we get that bit of information on chain in its entirety.
00:14:58.196 - 00:15:59.710, Speaker A: Instead, let's talk about when do we need that information, when do we need that bit of information about what the price of something is. And the way I like to explain it is just to go back to traditional real world legal contracts. And so, like, Jacob, you and I can write a contract under the laws of the province of Ontario that say, hey, at the end of the month we're going to make a bet on whether Bitcoin is above 10,000 or below 10,000 and we got to pay each other a million bucks. You make a million bucks above, I make it if it's below. We write this down, it's a private contract, nobody even needs to know it exists, right. We both sign it and at the end of the month, if we don't do what we say we're going to do, I can sue you or you can sue me. And the way that I think is kind of interesting here is if you think of that contract, we don't need an Oracle for us to pay out that contract, right.
00:15:59.710 - 00:16:50.220, Speaker A: If we just do what the contract says and we both agree that the contract was fulfilled, we don't need to call any Oracle at all. We don't need to sue anybody, we don't need to talk to any lawyers, we don't need to talk to any court system. We only use the court system in the traditional setup to enforce it if you don't do what you say you're going to do. So another way to look at it is like this is all written optimistically. So think like L2. Think like what the optimism team is doing with L2 scaling. You assume that people will do what they're supposed to do and you only use the exit game as this enforcement mechanism to, to kind of compel them to do the right thing if they are misbehaving.
00:16:50.220 - 00:18:08.884, Speaker A: And the priceless idea is designed to do exactly the same thing where we can watch this contract which is written on the blockchain so we see exactly what the contract is supposed to do. Everyone that has access to the blockchain can observe the contract and say like, hey, is this being followed? And then we design a system of economic incentives where if a participant doesn't follow it, they'll get liquidated and if they disagree with that liquidation, they can appeal it to the Oracle. So the Oracle is only used to resolve disputes about whether people did what they said they were going to do. And the biggest reason for this that makes this so I personally think that DeFi contracts in the future will be written this way is just scalability, man. You can't have thousands or millions or hundreds of millions of contracts written where you're getting these price feeds pushed chain all the time. You instead want to have millions of contracts written optimistically, similar to how they're written. Like millions of contracts are written in the traditional legal system.
00:18:08.884 - 00:18:54.500, Speaker A: The Oracle should be an enforcement mechanism. It shouldn't be like the default thing you look to and then I can talk to other stuff about if you want to make this thing be scalable and fast right now with an on chain price feed, kind of the way stuff is written currently you can't do a lot of high speed applications. You can't have a lot of leverage because there's a gap between when prices are reported on chain, and in that gap, a lot of stuff could happen. So you need to way over collateralize things and becomes capital efficient and becomes problematic in the design. So this priceless idea is basically saying, hey, let's write everything optimistically. Let's assume people do what the contract says they're going to do, and let's only use the Oracle if people disagree.
00:18:55.160 - 00:18:56.100, Speaker B: Gotcha.
00:18:58.040 - 00:19:59.944, Speaker A: So what can you do today to answer your question and make it more relevant to this AMA and the event? The uma, infrastructure can let anyone define what we call a price identifier that the Oracle, we'll call this dispute resolution system will respond to. And once that price identifier exists and is approved, which is like an on chain governance process, then you can deploy a contract today that can create synthetic tokens that reference that price identifier. So let's call it synthetic gold or whatever. And you can create synthetic gold, synthetic apples, synthetic whatever you want to do. You can create those on chain today where there is no need for an on chain price feed. We don't need to push data all the time for what the price of this thing is. It's enforced off chain pricelessly and it works.
00:19:59.944 - 00:20:20.670, Speaker A: The crazy thing is that it actually works that we can secure large amounts of value without actually requiring any Oracle prices on chain. And so, yeah, it's kind of only been really man in the last three or four months. We've proven that this works in reality. And that's been kind of exciting for.
00:20:21.700 - 00:20:58.312, Speaker B: I mean, it's been awesome to see. Like I said at the beginning, it's been amazing to see kind of the project progress over the years from very much like this, I think, kind of idea for securing value to now this actual system that is implemented and securing actual value. Right. It's been pretty amazing to see that progression. So, no, I think it's very exciting. I did have a question around sort of like the priceless contract design. Like you said, that sort of like in the real world, all contracts don't need to go to the judge unless there's a dispute.
00:20:58.312 - 00:21:28.630, Speaker B: Right. Do you have any kind of secondary systems in a way that prevent people from griefing the system? Right. Like you could kind of see that there would be an example where people may just kind of optimistically say that all of these things are out of whack and maybe that ends up having pushing all the contracts over to Oracles. Right. For dispute resolution. Is there sort of like a mechanism inside the protocol that kind of disable or kind of economically disadvantages griefers and that sort of thing?
00:21:29.560 - 00:22:11.788, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. You could say, hey, don't be an asshole and don't trigger this stuff. But that doesn't work in doesn't work, like environment. Yeah, it doesn't work like that. It's got to be costly. So we've looked at the cost pretty carefully and very carefully and it made sure that it's not economically profitable to just go and trigger a bunch of disputes, if you will. And again, to extend the analogy to the legal system, it's like saying you don't want to make it cheap or free to sue people because then you probably would have a bunch of assholes suing people.
00:22:11.788 - 00:22:54.572, Speaker A: And right now you can argue that the incentive structure in the legal system is broken. It's too expensive to trigger a dispute, right. If lots of small guys get screwed over because they don't have the legal resources to go and fight for what they're owed and time and all that kind of stuff. So we think about this pretty carefully. And the other way to think to kind of detail to add is it really is like an escalation game. So the logic here, actually the way it works is you're observing these positions off chain and then the moment somebody dips below their collateralization requirement or aren't doing what they say they're going to do, they get liquidated. So they get instantaneously liquidated.
00:22:54.572 - 00:23:30.670, Speaker A: They don't have to wait for a price update, but that liquidation. And that liquidation will pay a reward to the liquidator. But that reward doesn't go out immediately, it gets delayed time locked for a period of time during which somebody could dispute it and say, hey, that's wrong. And so then we have the incentives done that if you improperly liquidate somebody, it's costly to you, you'll make money if you're right, you'll lose money if you're wrong. And the same with the dispute. If you dispute somebody, you'll actually make money if you're right and you'll lose money if you're wrong. So that we don't have this griefing problem.
00:23:31.120 - 00:23:32.110, Speaker B: Got you.
00:23:33.520 - 00:24:10.170, Speaker A: And then I'll go back to the fact that in theory, most people have thought that in theory this is really cool and it's all kind of interesting, but they've wanted to see it in practice and now we have a few months of data of it in practice and it shockingly works. Right, so liquidations happen, they're not really invalid. The one invalid liquidation that someone did, as I think a test just to see how it happened got disputed and we're able to have this whole thing secure a lot of value with minimal transactions and minimal actually minimal usage of the blockchain itself.
00:24:11.260 - 00:24:28.924, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. And I mean that's critical, right, from the scalability and just like cost perspective as well, right, okay, cool. Awesome. And then let's see, I have a couple more questions. Let's see how we're doing on time. And then Carl, I see you have a question in there too. Let's see.
00:24:28.924 - 00:25:12.670, Speaker B: So what would be sort know, you have this experience of on the one know, working quite like a lot of years really as a trader, right, in the centralized finance world and kind of traditional finance, if you will. And now you have these years of thinking quite deeply about these kind of decentralized finance situations. What can DeFi contracts do and what does DeFi enable? I know we've talked on a little bit from the legal perspective, the contract side of things that you just can't do in the traditional finance world. What is kind of the case for DeFi being strictly better than what's currently existing? Maybe scale aside, but basically, what can we do?
00:25:14.320 - 00:26:28.976, Speaker A: I think the most powerful argument is just all around barriers to entry or cost to entry. So if you think about let's use the example of publishing any anything pre Internet. To publish something pre internet, you either needed to be like a journalist in a newspaper or got a publisher to print your book and it just cost a lot to actually get information out there. And then you lower the barrier to producing information by creating this internet thing and blogs emerge and podcasts emerge and all these other alternative forms of creating information and media come into existence and the cost of disseminating information because the barrier to create it goes way down. The same thing is completely true with finance. So like financial innovation or new financial ideas, it's extremely, extremely expensive to create a new financial product in the traditional financial system. Somebody that tried to start a mutual fund told me once you need to have $100 million of assets under management to create a new mutual fund that's going to be at all profitable.
00:26:28.976 - 00:27:01.970, Speaker A: Right. DFI completely changes those economics so that people can create new products or new financial ideas at extremely low cost. And that to me is the most promising or exciting or interesting thing alive. And so it's hard to imagine what's going to emerge out of that. But the fact that you can create a new financial product at three, four orders of magnitude cheaper cost than you could in the traditional financial world, there's something big there.
00:27:03.540 - 00:27:56.512, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, no, I think that that's definitely true, right? There's so many, in a way, barriers, not just from the financial perspective of being able to take part in these markets, but even just from a regulatory perspective, right? Whether that's like the accredited investor model in the US that restricts certain asset classes or the scene from The Big Short where the guys need to try to get their ISDA agreement and they can't get it because they don't have the capital. Mean these are the things that restrict people from being able to trade and otherwise take part in sort of these markets. And of course, none of this is going to exist in this trustless permissionless model of DeFi that we're it's. I think it's really exciting and a great case for really opening this up and democratizing it for everybody. Awesome. OK, there are a lot of questions coming in, so I will start reading some of these off.
00:27:56.512 - 00:28:03.750, Speaker B: So first question is from Carl. Carl says, does Uma provide any tools for Dao management right now?
00:28:05.720 - 00:28:29.790, Speaker A: I'd probably say Carl, like I look at the token, the Uma token as really being it is a voting me where people vote on price requests, like the kind of Oracle function. You're a judge in the system and it also is a token for changing certain parameters. But I wouldn't say that we're a Dow management platform.
00:28:31.760 - 00:28:39.570, Speaker B: Cool question from Vince. I don't know. Vince, do you want to ask this directly? Are you available? Sure.
00:28:41.140 - 00:29:13.130, Speaker C: So my question was asking, based off that assertion you're making about avoiding actually making transactions on the blockchain, still enforcing some consensus on what the real world information is. So I think the term counterfactual plays here where you're basically at the credible threat of bringing in the real world data to enforce the transaction, but you're not actually doing it. So I'm kind of curious if there's any good examples of that that you have. I don't think that's very popular yet.
00:29:18.880 - 00:30:15.900, Speaker A: Let me just explain our current system of how that kind of works and then you can push me if I'm not quite getting at your question. But basically, let's take the Maker Dow system where if you have a maker CDP right now, you push data on chain that ensures that CDP is correctly collateralized. And our basic argument here is saying, okay, let's not have any on chain data, let's just have all the observers off chain. So you could be one observer off chain saying, hey, the CDP needs to be 150% collateralized. I know what the price of ETH in dollar terms is over here. I can observe this and say whether it's collateralized or not. And so literally, as long as nobody is saying it's under collateralized, the system assumes it is valid and then you're free to liquidate that position at the moment you choose to at whenever you choose to, but if you're wrong, it's costly to you.
00:30:15.900 - 00:30:26.930, Speaker A: So that's like the whole kind of way we look at this where everything is assumed to be correctly collateralized until somebody says otherwise and it's enforced that way. Does that kind of answer your question?
00:30:28.760 - 00:30:29.510, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:30.440 - 00:31:13.600, Speaker C: So that's like an example of one where it can play in. You can be basically I call it CDP being popped by someone who just shows up because the enforcement mechanism was there in the first place. So it's a good example of one, but yeah, it's one example. I was just wondering if there's other examples like that one maker that's worked pretty well for them so far, especially with off chain data that's more specific and maybe further away from price data, from price pairing. So maker is just pairs, but what about feeding in temperature or something like that? Is that something you guys have considered?
00:31:15.460 - 00:31:49.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we are specifically trying to keep our system fairly narrowly focused on price data. On stuff that you can observe. And we're specifically doing that just because we want to constrain the know. Auger is an example of actually, like, I would say, auger. We're very inspired by auger in many ways, but auger is an example of something else that does kind of follow the same methodology, where you have this escalation game that keeps going up until you have, like, a fork in the universe. Right. But it's generalized in what they can support.
00:31:49.820 - 00:32:28.890, Speaker A: And so you could actually argue that auger's never hit the fork in the universe kind of final step of their process because it's just more and more expensive. They figure out truth along the way up. So, yeah, to answer your question, we're trying to stay narrowly focused around price data because it just constrains the problem, and we think we can execute better in that more narrow scope, and it makes it clearer to the system about what the truth is. When you start having stuff that's very ambiguous, it becomes more of a governance issue or more of, like, more of a true kind of consensus within a community.
00:32:30.140 - 00:32:30.792, Speaker C: Makes sense.
00:32:30.846 - 00:32:31.016, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:31.038 - 00:32:36.504, Speaker C: You're trying to define it more specifically so you can just go ahead and solve that problem. Auger is trying to keep it wide.
00:32:36.552 - 00:32:37.150, Speaker A: Open.
00:32:39.200 - 00:32:46.476, Speaker C: But they still are kind of limited, I guess, in what they've been putting up markets for so far. That makes sense, though.
00:32:46.498 - 00:32:46.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:46.722 - 00:32:47.950, Speaker C: To actually solve the problem.
00:32:49.040 - 00:33:16.952, Speaker B: Thank you. Awesome. Looks like we have a question from the YouTube stream from George Charles. He's asking about the expiring multi party contracts that, uma, provides. I think, in general, he's looking for an explanation of sort of what these actually are and I guess how maybe you could use them. So it says that the EMP go ahead.
00:33:17.006 - 00:34:04.668, Speaker A: Yeah, this just is our own kind of code that comes from just the history of how we got there. So if you start Jacob, going back to the idea of a derivative between two people, that is like a bilateral contract between two people. And we had a version with synthetic token where only one person could mint the synthetic token. So you had one creator that created all these tokens, and the tokens could be traded around here. The multiparty refers to the fact that anybody can become a minter of these synthetic tokens. So there's multiple sponsors and multiple creators which make or die looks this way too, where you have multiple CDP creators and lots of tokens. So many people on both sides, both sponsors and token holders.
00:34:04.668 - 00:34:19.244, Speaker A: And then the expiring is because we have an expiry date on it. And I can talk for a long time about the financial engineering behind why an expiry date makes for a simpler synthetic asset that will expire to be.
00:34:19.282 - 00:34:19.870, Speaker B: Worth.
00:34:21.680 - 00:34:43.196, Speaker A: What it's tracking. The flip side of that would be making a perpetual version that has no expiry date. And we are actually currently in development on that. We're building it public, so it's on our GitHub. We're going to have that version audited later this year. But it's a different type of contract. So yeah, EMP is our code name for expiring.
00:34:43.196 - 00:34:52.410, Speaker A: It has an expiry date, multiparty multiple token sponsors, token holders. And we might have something else. Maybe we'll call the PMP for the perpetual multiparty contract in the future.
00:34:53.580 - 00:35:01.864, Speaker B: Nice. Awesome. Cool. We're going to hold you to the PMP name. It's named here. Awesome. Cool.
00:35:01.864 - 00:35:18.130, Speaker B: And then another question from what's it like? Sorry, what is uma's, governance like and then how has it performed so far? I know you said it's been maybe about four months or so since everything's been going down. How's that been so far?
00:35:21.060 - 00:36:10.700, Speaker A: I would say good. Not perfect by any means. So we want more voter participation. When gas fees were really high, it actually created a disincentive small voters. One important point here is we pay rewards to voters who participate in voting. So this is part of the economics around our whole dispute resolution system that if you're one of the judges here, you get paid rewards if you vote and vote correctly, where correctly is defined as voting with the majority. And so we had a problem right when gas prices were really high that voting actually cost more than the rewards people were getting to vote.
00:36:10.700 - 00:36:49.420, Speaker A: And so we actually kind of came up with a voter rebate system where we'rebating those transaction fees. It's one thing that we came up with in terms of, uma, tokens. You'd get back your voter fees as a kind of token reward. But generally speaking we are relatively governance minimized. So we're trying to not do too much on the governance side. It's basically been fairly limited scoped functions and that part has actually worked pretty well. So I'm fairly pleased with keeping the questions we're asking our community or asking our token holders to be pretty narrow and relatively infrequent.
00:36:51.200 - 00:37:34.750, Speaker B: Gotcha. Cool. And then I think kind of Carl's next question touches on, I think overall an interesting topic here, which know as a rule, uma, is like trying to touch the chain as least frequently as possible. Right? And of course you also just mentioned another situation where even kind of a unique economic model where that encourages participation couldn't even then clear the hurdle of gas prices and an overcrowded chain. So I guess sort of kind of an overall question around scalability. So Carl's question in particular is are you using ZK proofs for the off chain component? Are you using anything for the off chain component? Are you considering moving to L two or anything on L two? Just kind of, I guess, a broad scalability question.
00:37:36.560 - 00:38:30.796, Speaker A: So I think it's important to split the kind of the transactions our protocol uses into two parts. So you have the financial contracts themselves. So in this case the EMP and what transactions it has. And then if there is a dispute and it goes to the Oracle, what are the transactions that have to happen to resolve that dispute? How do you get the voters happening there? So if we split the transactions between those two, the EMP contracts or the financial contracts themselves are really designed to minimize Oracle usage and truly minimize the number of transactions that have to happen on the blockchain itself. And so we don't need a scalability solution. It actually works better for now if we're on the base layer because transactions should be so rare. So there is no ZK proofs or anything like that.
00:38:30.796 - 00:39:21.660, Speaker A: We're literally just observing the blockchain, and we're only touching it when a contract needs to get liquidated on the Oracle side. Now switching gears to the other side, like when there is a dispute or some governance action that needs to get voted on right now, that is being done on the base layer, and it's kind of expensive. And we are curious or looking at in a V two, how we could scale those votes to make it be more efficient. But it's kind of like a separate problem. It's like, how do we make the we call it the DVM, the data verification mechanism. How do we make that more efficient is a separate problem from how do we make the contracts more efficient. And I actually think our contracts are super efficient as is and fit very well in a high fee environment.
00:39:23.360 - 00:40:07.390, Speaker B: Got you. Awesome. Okay, great. We're nearing the end of our scheduled time. So I'm going to give the question that I give to everybody at the end, which I know you preface this almost entirely, saying you're not a big hackathon guy or at. Least not previously to this, but given that we've exposed you heavily to the hackathon environment, I wonder if you'll have a great answer to this question. But if you were taking part in ETH online right now as a hacker, what would you be building or kind of what areas are you most curious about and what are kind of the ideas that are floating around your head that you wish you had time to take a look at and that the hackathon would be a great opportunity for that?
00:40:08.960 - 00:40:09.756, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:09.938 - 00:40:10.376, Speaker B: Shit.
00:40:10.408 - 00:40:25.760, Speaker A: Jacob when I go to your in person events, I do want to hack on this stuff, and I'll be clear, I'm going to be like an ETH Global loyalist. I'm only going to hack at ETH Global events. That'll be my promise.
00:40:26.100 - 00:40:27.330, Speaker B: Appreciate that.
00:40:28.660 - 00:41:40.100, Speaker A: But I effectively have way too many ideas floating around in the back of my head of how we can make financial products that I'll say, for the most part mirror things that exist in traditional finance structures that exist in traditional finance. But how we can make those now and today and it's only really been in the last few months, I think that a lot of this stuff has become possible. So creating options and creating structured notes and this perpetual synthetic contract we're creating and just all sorts of other ideas. I think they're all possible. Now, what I'd say as a concrete idea that I think is really cool, our team or this is kind of coming out of the community is building ethereum gas futures. So these are going to be synthetic tokens that, say, have monthly expiries that will settle to be whatever the average gas price is that month. And so I actually would love to be working on this at a hackathon right now because I think it's a very useful and usable product where I could imagine you have a strip.
00:41:40.100 - 00:42:05.890, Speaker A: You have, like, going into next year, you have January, February, March, April, May, June. And you can see where people are predicting average gas prices to be each of those months. And projects like ours, or rather say some of the high you go to the ETH gas station leaderboard and some of the projects that are really using a lot of gas, they could actually hedge their gas exposure by buying those tokens. I think that'd be really cool.
00:42:06.900 - 00:42:09.680, Speaker B: That makes sense. Oil futures for gas.
00:42:10.900 - 00:42:11.744, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:11.942 - 00:42:33.304, Speaker B: Cool. Love It. Awesome. Okay. Well, Hart, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us and share your views on these things. And of course, I think really excited, as I've mentioned, to just kind of continue to see the progression and what you're building and looking forward to the perpetual contracts and I mean, so much more. Right.
00:42:33.304 - 00:43:03.700, Speaker B: So? Yeah, big. Thank you both for doing this and as well as supporting not just this event, but many in the past. And we've really enjoyed working with you and I think massive add to the event and anybody who's looking to build with really any exposure to the real world as part of their hacks, take a look at, uma they have prizes at the event and of course, a workshop and everything on the pages like you'd expect. So take a look. Might be a great fit for your hack. And thanks again, Hart.
00:43:04.680 - 00:43:06.710, Speaker A: Thanks, Jacob. Pleasure to be here.
00:43:07.320 - 00:43:08.610, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, take care, everybody.
