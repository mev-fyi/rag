00:07:18.420 - 00:07:32.984, Speaker A: Hey everybody. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. My name is Kartik, one of the co founders of ETH Global. And I'm super excited to welcome all of you to Scaling Ethereum. We're getting all of you kind of rolling in.
00:07:32.984 - 00:08:25.384, Speaker A: I see already a few hundred people joining us on the live stream. So I'm super glad to be welcoming all of you again. See a lot of familiar faces, all lot of new faces and can't wait to kick off this hackathon. So all of you are joining us on ETHGlobal TV. That is our live setup that lets you experience this whole event with us in a really shared state. So just as a heads up for all of you who are looking at this thing for the first time, we'll be using this platform for the entirety of this hackathon and for today, which means that you'll be able to watch the stream on the left side here in the window. And for any of the questions you have for our panelists, for our talks or us, you can ask them here on the chat and we'll be able to relay these questions directly to the speakers onto the live stream.
00:08:25.384 - 00:09:08.372, Speaker A: Also, as a note, I really encourage all of you to sign up or log into the chat because we will be giving out POAP NFT tokens for all the people who participated during this summit today. So if you haven't already logged in, try sign up and say hi to us in the chat. So with that said, this event I want to talk to you a little bit about ETH Global. So scaling ethereum is brought to you by ETH Global. And ETH Global is an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to make it easy for thousands of developers to come on into the web3 ecosystem and really shape the future that we're heading into. And we do that by hosting summits and hackathons.
00:09:08.372 - 00:09:38.980, Speaker A: Scaling ethereum is exactly that. This is a three week long hackathon and we also have a handful of summits as part of this month. And I'll be kind of walking through what's happening starting with the summits. So we have three summits. Each of them will happen on Friday. Today is our first summit, which is a scaling summit. And you'll learn all the things about different scaling techniques to different scaling protocols and how they work and all the details of anywhere from their internals to where they are to just what makes them possible.
00:09:38.980 - 00:10:22.450, Speaker A: And we'll be covering all of that as a high level overview right after this kickoff for the hackathon. Then next Friday we'll have our merge Summit. We'll be talking about what is happening with the E Two merge. And you'll kind of get to hear all the things about what we're doing to scale the layer one side of Ethereum. And then two weeks from now, which is Friday the 30th, we'll be doing our Zero Knowledge Summit. And we'll be kind of talking to a lot of interesting speakers about what is happening in the world of Zero Knowledge, especially as it relates to scalability programmability and overall, the things that are just not possible without some of these new primitives. So all that said, there's a lot on the summit side that we'll be sharing on our website.
00:10:22.450 - 00:11:24.836, Speaker A: And with that, I want to get off and talk to you about the hackathon. So this is a massive event for us. There's over 425 hackers that are participating just for the next few weeks on the hackathon side, and just alone for the summits, we already have 400 people attending or not the hackers, but directly watching just the talks, the hackers themselves, all the participants are coming in from over 56 different countries spanning 18 different time zones. So we're going to have a lot of fun over the next three to four weeks and can't wait to see the hundreds of different types of projects we get to see that tackle scaling. This is just a simple map of where all the developers and participants are coming in from. We have a really diverse set of audience and it's just going to be super fun. In addition to all of that, we also have 100 plus mentors who are here to help you with your projects, especially if you have any questions related to scaling technologies that are out there.
00:11:24.836 - 00:12:02.492, Speaker A: And they are coming in from over 20 different companies who will be there to help you really get to the project and really ship something super cool and fun. And on top of all of that, we tallied up the numbers. And this is the first event where we've broken our own records. We're giving away over $200,000 in prizes for this event. And it's going to be super fun to see all the amazing things that you built with different protocols to different solutions out there and just challenging yourself to try new things. I want to especially thank some of our amazing sponsors here. So I want to thank arbitram optimism.
00:12:02.492 - 00:13:33.920, Speaker A: ZK sync starkware scale loop ring the Graph Seller connect polygon raiden ZK swap taurus Compound grants Program protocol Labs the Uniswap grants program ave superfluid chainlink new cipher covalent zapper one inch Teller secret network ethereum foundation IPFS main dpay near protocol diversify rare bowl lemiscap and ENS For being with us for this event, there are a lot of amazing scaling solutions, there's a lot of cool D Five products that work on layer two, and a lot of our supporters from the community that are helping us out with this event. And I'm super excited for all of us to join and just put our forces and heads together to really make something cool for the next month. So this event is called Scaling Ethereum, and a lot of what we've talked about publicly has been really carefully shaped around what it means to do something related to scaling. And the most common question we got for this event was what can I build if I don't know how to do things on layer two? So I want to quickly highlight the intent from our side and sort of what this means for all of you who are listening in. The key thing to take away is that we don't want you to necessarily come in with all the context you have. You need to have to do anything on layer two. This event is designed specifically for us to see what it's going to take for the whole ecosystem to make the transition to layer two a lot easier.
00:13:33.920 - 00:14:53.880, Speaker A: As a result, we have support from a lot of existing D Five protocols and a lot of existing layer two solutions to help make it possible for everybody to see what we need to do to get everything done as smooth as possible. And as a result, if you're not sure how something works, this is the type of event where you get to ask the layer two solutions that you might be interested in using to understand how you can actually deploy something that you already have on main net onto layer two. That means you can try to port existing things you've done in the past in the DFI world, or if you were a participant in the last NFT hackathon, and see if you can deploy the same things on a layer two system and really make it easy for everybody to use your application without any gas or additional costs. You also have now the ability to really work on brand new applications, whether they're in DFI or just any other category, to deploy directly on layer two and really start and pave the way for a brand new ecosystem to emerge. On the layer two side, there are a lot of developer tools that we need to make it easy to have others also try out and bring L2 to mainstream. And on top of all of that, you don't have to necessarily only have to do programming related project. You can also use this time to make it easy for others to learn how to do something on L2.
00:14:53.880 - 00:16:01.400, Speaker A: And that means you can work on documentation, you can work on guides, you can work on anything you can to make it easy for everybody else out there to really explore how they can move everything to a more scalable solution. So that gives you a little bit more context and I have a few more things I want to share on that and we'll go through that in just a few minutes. So we have the summit today and we have the hackathon kicking off. So I want to give a quick overview of how the hackathon is going to work for the next three weeks. For those of you who participated in NFT hack, you probably saw our weekend version of a hackathon and we're kind of going back to a month long series where we give enough time to really understand and really make sure that you are getting the help you need to submit and work on your projects. So I'll be walking through what it means from the team formation side, how you can get help or how you can think about new ideas, all the prizes you can win, how the talks and workshops are going to be set up, how judging submission is going to work for this one. And then lastly the Summits, and how you can expect to be a lot more engaged with our summit related talks.
00:16:01.400 - 00:16:42.276, Speaker A: So for all of the participants of the hackathon, the key things you notice here is that everything is happening on Discord. Which means that if you have staked on your dashboard and you have connected your Discord, you will see what's on the left side here on this screenshot, which means there's a scaling ethereum category and there are more than one channel that show up. And that means you've successfully gained access to all of the event specific channels. And if you're not seeing any of these channels, please message anybody on the global team on Discord. But this is where everything is going to happen. This has channels for all of us to talk with each other. This has the channels for you to ask any of the protocols questions specific to those protocols.
00:16:42.276 - 00:17:44.850, Speaker A: So you can see on the bottom of that screenshot, if you have a question about a really specific company or protocol, you can message them there and they'll be there to help you. You can have all the things from just generic help you can need on the developer side, whether it's solidity or front end or back end, all these things are all going to happen through Discord and that's where all of our mentors are also going to be. On top of all of that, we've also sent a calendar invite for all the key talks and workshops that are happening over the next few weeks. And the entire schedule for everything that's happening, whether it's the hackathon or the Summit, is already on the website. We want this thing to be asynchronous as possible. So if you are in a position where you can attend something because of a time zone or a conflict, we want this thing to be as easy as possible for you to catch up on. So all of that is available on Scaling, APGlobal, Co and you can check everything there from all details and it'll be updated live every time we do something.
00:17:44.850 - 00:18:39.232, Speaker A: So with that, let's go into how the hackathon is structured. Essentially, you can start working on a project now in terms of the rules and the criteria for this event, everything that you're going to submit must begin during the course of the hackathon and you can start coding. As of today, you can have up to five members on your team if you would like to work on a team and you have three weeks from now to submit. So that'll three weeks and the Sunday that's coming from there. So in terms of quickly just going over the rules more granularly. Everything that you are submitting to be eligible for a prize must be done during the course of this hackathon, which means that anything that you're submitting should be done from today to the next three week onwards. All the submissions should be related to scalability and this is a very broad rule that we're bringing on for this event.
00:18:39.232 - 00:19:57.450, Speaker A: And that means whatever you're doing should interact with something related to either a layer two system or a layer one scaling side. Which means that if you're only working on something that's entirely just DFI and does nothing to address anywhere from throughput to gas costs or any sort of abstraction, it will unfortunately not be eligible for this event. We really want everybody to see what's possible on the layer two side and there are a lot of options out there that have different trade offs and different features that you can explore and we would like you to give that a try. On top of all of that, only RSVP attendees are eligible to win any prizes, which means that if your teammates are not on your team from our dashboard officially and you do win a prize, we will not be able to give a prize to somebody who's not listed as a team member during the time of submission. So you really want to make sure that everybody who's on your team is confirmed as an attendee and is successfully added as a team member on your dashboard. And on top of all of that, we know that there are a lot of broad categories here that will always have their edge cases. So if you have any other questions or clarifications you would like, you can ask anybody on the global team to clarify and we'll be happy to answer those questions for you.
00:19:57.450 - 00:21:01.452, Speaker A: And I kind of really want to just dig into the fact that a lot of you have said, I don't know how certain things work on L2 or I'm super new to I've only been doing solidity for a few weeks to a few months and I'm really new to all this thing. Am I still a good candidate to be a participant at this event? The answer is yes, because we want this to be exploratory by design. And on top of all of that, there are a lot of others who are also in a very similar position as you. And we really want to make sure that you have a chance to find somebody who's in a similar position and work together. So as a result, if you are still looking for a team, you can head over to find a team channel on our discord and you can talk to everybody who is also looking for team members, whether that's a complementary skill set or they don't know what they want to work on. You can use that channel to see everybody who's in a similar position and contact those attendees and potentially pair up. On top of all of that, we really encourage all of you to introduce yourself in the scaling channel because there's over 500 of you from so many different parts of the world and it'd be awesome to get to know all of you from our side.
00:21:01.452 - 00:21:39.100, Speaker A: And on top of all of that, we are doing a few live calls as well for you to help find potential teammates. So there was one earlier today. If you missed that one, there's going to be another one on Monday. The schedule and all that information is on our discord and also the website. So you can join that call if timing permits and really use that to talk to people who are also looking for teammates. And on top of all of that, it is not required that you have a team. Obviously it makes things a lot easier if you have a few people doing certain things, but you are totally also welcome to work independently and hack solo.
00:21:39.100 - 00:22:40.124, Speaker A: So all that said, let's talk about talks and workshops. There is a lot of content that we're working on for this event because this is really the opportunity for everybody to see what's possible and what's happening on the layer two side, the e two merge side and zero knowledge side. And this content touches everyone from beginners to experts in this ecosystem. So there's going to be talks, panels, workshops for the hackers here. We're going to be doing a feedback session every week, which means that if you're working on something you would like real time feedback or help or any guidance, you can join a call with us once a week and really showcase what you've been doing so far and really kind of use that as a way to get direct help in a live setting. On top of all of that, all this information is also available on your info center, which all of you should have a link for in every email and calendar invite. And because this is designed to be asynchronous as possible.
00:22:40.124 - 00:23:18.408, Speaker A: If you cannot attend a talk or a workshop because of a time zone or any other conflict, you can immediately watch that after it ends on our YouTube channel because everything is recorded. So there's no need to try to do everything as it happens or make any different trade offs. We are recording everything. And one more time, everything is available on scaling ETHGlobal co. Lastly, there's a few more things. So check ins. So everybody who has staked here knows that we are introducing the notion of check ins for our three week long event.
00:23:18.408 - 00:24:17.464, Speaker A: And the gist of all of this is a check in is something that happens once a week where we'll message you on discord and also your dashboard and ask you to give an update on what you've done since the last time we chatted. This is designed as a way for us to help make sure that you are not blocked in anything, or you're getting all the help you need. And this is the time where you get to ask us for things that you would like to get anywhere from help on or unstuck on, or you need to really think through something or just tell us what's happening. Because it is a three week long event, we are not expecting you to spend too much time or all of your time on your projects. So these check ins are designed as a way for us to get a pulse of what's happening with your project. Your stake is returned if you respond to these check ins on your dashboard and if you submit a project, and all that information again is available on the Info Center and also on your dashboard. And all this will be managed directly through your dashboard to give a quick overview.
00:24:17.464 - 00:25:12.636, Speaker A: A lot of you usually ask us what it means for these check ins. And this is like a simple slide where I just want to give an idea of what this means and how you should think about structuring it. We would like you to spend the first week, which is the next seven days, exploring sort of what is possible if you don't already have an idea on, understanding what you would like to work on, or find potential other people to work with, or really think through what you're trying to do as possible. And kind of the best things, the tools or the protocols you need to work with. You should spend the second week really having a basic version of your idea done so you can try it out, get feedback from us, get feedback from any mentors or sponsors. And on the third week you should just polish it up to see if everything is good to go and add any additional things you want to add to make it really nice and ready for submissions. And that should be the week where you're kind of in a state to submit everything and record that video.
00:25:12.636 - 00:25:59.944, Speaker A: And submissions are due again on the 9th, which is three weeks from now. So the way judging is going to work is that as you are readying the day of the submission deadline, you'll be required to make a four minute video for your project. And this video will be the official submission, so where everything will be video submissions only. So this really gives you all this time to make sure that you can really tell us about who you are, what you've been working on and what your app is and your submission is, and record that and submit that on your dashboard. And we'll use this video to do the judging for the event, which happens the week of the few days after submissions. And all this again happens through all of your dashboard. So just a quick reminder that because you have to make a video, please make sure that you don't do this thing last minute.
00:25:59.944 - 00:27:02.130, Speaker A: Because it does take a little bit of time to make sure that the video is just anywhere from within the time limit. To doesn't have any audio video issues and is really the best encapsulation of yourself as a team and your project. And of course, this is an online event with hundreds of people, so we want to make sure that all of you are being mindful of our code of conduct. The rules and the criteria for how we want everybody to behave is outlined on ETHGlobal Co Rules. And even though we have a lot of details there, the gist of it is that please be respectful to everybody on the discord. And for this event, harassment and abuse is not tolerated in any form. And if you need any help or if you have any questions or concerns, whether it's about how your experience has been at the event or on our mentorship or literally any topic about the event, please don't hesitate to reach out to anybody on the Global team and we'll be happy to address and answer any of your questions.
00:27:02.130 - 00:28:03.332, Speaker A: And finally, because there's a lot to wrap up, I want to remind everybody here that you should definitely pace yourself. We don't want this thing to be a marathon. The event is specifically designed to be three weeks because we don't want you to actively make any trade offs or choices between your work or your school or any other full time or longer commitments. And this having all this time makes it easy for you to really pick the time and the hours you want to spend on your projects. And we don't want this thing to be exhausting for you in any form. We want you to specifically have fun doing this thing because all these events are designed as a platform and a way for all of us to share what's happening in this ecosystem and how you can learn what's going on, especially at the cutting edge. And this specific event is very much about experimentation, because not only are you learning about what could be possible on layer two, all of our protocols are here to get that feedback to understand how they can make that transition from layer one to layer two the best experience as possible.
00:28:03.332 - 00:28:49.008, Speaker A: So really focus on the learning side of this, and we want to be there to help you get to where you want to be as part of your event. So all that said, that covers all of the logistics. Want to wish everybody a very happy hacking for the next three weeks, and I'm going to quickly shift gears to what is happening today with some of the prizes, our sponsors, and then move us off into our scaling summit. So today's schedule is as follows. We are going to have a lot of amazing talks about what is happening in the world of scalability. We're going to learn about what all the types of roll ups are and how they work. Then we're specifically going to focus on how optimistic roll ups work and how the OVM is designed.
00:28:49.008 - 00:29:40.612, Speaker A: We're going to learn about how optimistic rollup works from the Arbitrum side. Then we're going to do a quick panel on different trade offs and how these roll up architectures are different and how they work. We're going to learn a bit more about how specifically Ethereum native chains work with layer one. We're going to learn about generally how the broad ecosystem of layer two has expanded from side chains to generally just other native specific blockchains. We're going to learn about the nuances of what it means to think about security of your assets for optimistic roll ups. We're going to learn about how liquidity and specifically DFI things will be possible in the world of L2. We're also going to have a lot more talks around just how do we actually make a lot more financial applications on the layer two side as we move everything over.
00:29:40.612 - 00:30:28.112, Speaker A: Then we're going to switch gears and learn more about the world of ZK roll ups. So we're going to have a talk on ZK Porter. We're going to learn a bit more about Starknets and what Starquare is doing. And then we also want to really show what's possible on the protocols that have already existed on layer two for a little bit while. And that's when we'll learn about how synthetics is currently on optimism and what they've learned and how they are thinking about their transition to there too. So this is just a quick preview of some of our talks, but I'll kind of go through all those as they happen in about an hour and a half. And with that I want to really kind of focus on some of the prizes for this hackathon and some of our amazing sponsors.
00:30:28.112 - 00:31:17.416, Speaker A: So there's a lot of things happening on that front. And what we're going to do is we ask some of our sponsors to share and record some videos for us to talk us through who they are, why they're excited to be part of this event, what they're working on, and how you can use their protocols or their apps into your hacks. So we're going to be quickly walking through some of these companies and these protocols. And what we'll do is we'll have Arbitrum first kick us off with what they are going to be sharing and we'll play a recorded video for them real quick. Welcome to Scaling Ethereum. I'm Stephen, co founder and CEO of Offchain Labs. The team building arbitrary.
00:31:17.416 - 00:31:50.892, Speaker A: We're super excited to be sponsoring the hackathon and can't wait to see all the awesome projects they'll build. And we hope that you'll hack On Arbitrum arbitram is an optimistic rollup scaling solution for Ethereum that's currently live on COVID with an open public and permissionless testnet and coming soon to a main net near you. We'll be actively participating throughout the hackathon. And some events that you don't want to miss are the Brainstorming session at 08:00 P.m. Eastern time on Thursday night. The Arbitrum keynote at 01:45 P.m. Eastern time on Friday, followed immediately by the optimistic roll up panel which we'll be participating in.
00:31:50.892 - 00:32:19.130, Speaker A: And on Monday at 01:00 P.m. Eastern Time, you can roll up your sleeves at the Arbitrum workshop and work with our developers to start building on Arbitrum. If you have any questions throughout the process, technical questions just want to bounce ideas off us or definitely to show us what you built. Please join us in on Discord. We'll be active in the scaling Ethereum discord as well as the Offchain Labs discord and we're there to support you every step of the way. And if you had so much fun in the hackathon building an Arbitrum and you couldn't get enough, well, we're hiring. So please join our team.
00:32:19.130 - 00:32:37.260, Speaker A: Hi, everybody. I'm ed Felton. I'm co founder and chief scientist at Offchain Labs. Let me tell you why you should use Arbitrum. Arbitrum has low costs and is scalable. We get the gas cost of most transactions down to around 2000. L one gas.
00:32:37.260 - 00:32:52.508, Speaker A: Arbitrum is fully EVM compatible. You can send EVM code directly to it. There's no special compiler. There's no special version. You don't have to use Solidity or Viper. You can use whatever toolchain you want. There's nothing to download.
00:32:52.508 - 00:33:22.252, Speaker A: An Arbitrum node speaks exactly the same RPC API as an Ethereum node. So to deploy a contract or to submit a transaction, you can send the very same bits that you send to Ethereum. Arbitrum is trustless. It's built on top of Ethereum. Its security is rooted in Ethereum. And Arbitrum guarantees that any one honest party can force correct execution of the entire chain. Arbitrum lets you break out of the limits that Ethereum puts on you.
00:33:22.252 - 00:33:52.436, Speaker A: You can go beyond Ethereum's transaction gas limit. Some other solutions have a lower gas limit than Ethereum. Ours is much, much higher. You can go beyond the contract size limit. Because of the way that Arbitrum works, we never need to deploy your contract on L One or run an entire transaction on L One. And therefore we can break beyond those super annoying size limits. And finally, Arbitrum is a more mature technology.
00:33:52.436 - 00:34:13.548, Speaker A: We've been running an open public testnet for about six months now. That's a full system. It includes the fraud proofs, all the security features and everything. Not a demonstration, a real system. You can use our Coven Four testnet today. We're a community project. We have never limited access to Arbitrum, and we never will.
00:34:13.548 - 00:34:41.760, Speaker A: Our testnets have been and our main net. Will be free and open for everyone to use. What you see on Testnet now is a main net release candidate. We are close to mainnet release. We're not yet ready to announce a date, but you'll be hearing about a main net date very soon. How do we do that? We do that by using an optimistic roll up type of approach with a little bit of secret sauce. So we record the call data of transactions on the L One chain.
00:34:41.760 - 00:35:38.890, Speaker A: We move computation and storage off chain, and the protocol merely confirms on the L One chain what everyone already knows is the correct result, and it's optimistic. That means that in the normal case, people simply post on the L One chain a correct claim about what your transaction will do, what the chain will do. We have a special and super efficient dispute resolution protocol that allows us to resolve any disputes that happen very quickly. So Arbitrum checks all the boxes. I don't think any other system can say it checks all five of the boxes. Low cost and scalability, fully EVM compatible, trustless breaking beyond the contract size and gas limits, and mature and fully available in a system today. If you have any questions using Arbitrum, please reach out and let us know.
00:35:38.890 - 00:36:25.940, Speaker A: Hey, there. My name is Harry Kalodner, and I'm co founder and CTO of Offchain Labs. We've been sponsoring ETH Global hackathons for almost two years now, and we're pumped to be back. We're especially excited because this hackathon focuses on scaling Ethereum, which is an area near and dear to our hearts as we've been developing Arbitrum. In order to make sure that everyone is excited as we are, we're offering our largest hackathon prizes yet, totaling $12,000. I'm going to tell you more about how you can win these prizes. Building on Arbitrum this hackathon, our prizes are broken down into four categories scalability, crosschain interoperability, protocol, development, and tooling.
00:36:25.940 - 00:37:20.280, Speaker A: The winner of each category will receive a $3,000 prize. I'm going to give you a bit more detail about each category so you can start to develop ideas for what you'll build this hackathon. Our first prize is eligible to any team that deploys their smart contracts on Arbitrum. But we're most excited about teams that take advantage of the scalability that Arbitrum provides to stretch the limits of what's possible in smart contracts. This is a pretty open ended prize, so we'd love for teams to have fun with it and can't wait to see what you come up with. Next up, I want to talk about cross chain interoperability. Arbitrum provides the general capability for Ethereum contracts to make Arbitrum transactions and Arbitrum contracts to make Ethereum transactions.
00:37:20.280 - 00:38:18.200, Speaker A: This sort of general ability to send transactions between the chains is a powerful building block for new crosschain primitives. A few ideas in this category are crosschain DEXes, new types of fast withdrawals, and crosschain synthetic assets. And we'll be happy to brainstorm with teams working towards these ideas or others. For this next prize, you'll be integrating directly at layer one with the Arbitrum smart contracts themselves. This is your chance to get into the nitty gritty details of protocol development by integrating directly with the core Arbitrum rollup smart contracts or the Arbitrum Token Bridge smart contracts. Work towards this prize to make the Arbitrum rollup protocol even better for Ethereum. Last but definitely not least, our final prize will go to the best Arbitrum related tooling.
00:38:18.200 - 00:38:54.870, Speaker A: Developer and user experience is critically important for the migration to layer two, and we'd like to recruit scaling Ethereum hackers to help. This prize will go to a team who makes an awesome piece of tooling to make Arbitrum easier to understand, easier to use, or easier to develop for. Thanks for listening and I hope people are excited to learn more and dig into Arbitrum over the course of this hackathon. Good luck and have fun. Amazing. Thank you so much, Harry and Ed. Those are super.
00:38:54.870 - 00:39:52.040, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much, Harry and Ed, for giving us an overview of Arbitrum and what you'll be doing for your prizes. For all of you looking who did not have a chance to catch up on the prizes that were just shared. I want to just quickly summarize that Arbitrum will be giving away $12,000 here, and they'll be giving prizes. For the best use of Arbitrum scalability, the best use of cross chain interoperability, the best use of arbitrary protocol in general, and the best tooling related Submissions for Arbitrum. So we've shared all this again in our prizes page. And with that, I want to go on to our next sponsor, and that is optimism. So we'll be sharing a quick video about optimism and how they're excited to be part of this event.
00:39:54.650 - 00:40:15.806, Speaker B: Hello, hackers. Welcome to the Optimism keynote. This maybe should have been a presentation on the technology and how it works, but it is not that. It's more like some kind of montage. In any case, I hope that you enjoy it and I hope that you stay hydrated and that you stop by our discord to say hi at the dawn of time.
00:40:15.988 - 00:41:03.180, Speaker A: The first ever response to the Bitcoin white paper http WW dot bitcoin.org bitcoin PDF we very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size. A long, long time ago. What I'm trying to think. Okay, how do I do it? Okay. Blockchain scalability. It was a real hard problem.
00:41:03.180 - 00:41:27.546, Speaker A: We came together from all corners to solve it. Hello, I'm Josh Stein. I'm the CEO of harbor. All right, so I'm Carl. I'm a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. Hey, everyone. My name is Kevin Ho, and I'm going to be your lecturer for chapter three.
00:41:27.546 - 00:41:48.174, Speaker A: I'm Borellian, a founding member of Consensus Diligence and a smart contract auditor. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. So, I'm Ben, I'm a part of plasma group, which is an open source, community driven plasma implementation. All right, everyone, so next up we have Liam Horn. He's going to be telling us about state channels. Clap.
00:41:48.174 - 00:42:13.306, Speaker A: Come on now. There we go. All right. Hey, does that TV show the slides or no? A couple posts by vitalik and 17 plasma implementers calls later. My god, these have been crazy.
00:42:13.408 - 00:42:24.430, Speaker B: And plasma XT. Plasma MVP. Plasma unlimited. Plasma cash, plasma debit, plasma cash flow.
00:42:25.250 - 00:42:27.498, Speaker A: Yet another plasma, thank goodness.
00:42:27.674 - 00:42:29.140, Speaker B: What is going on?
00:42:29.670 - 00:43:03.914, Speaker A: Plasma prime. This is, I would say fun with names, to be honest with mean. So the kind of history of plasma is somewhat interesting. Iteration after know first plasma MVP came out, but we realized that there were mass exit vulnerabilities. And then plasma cash kind of addresses this, but it has its own weakness with fungible assets and transaction history growth. And then plasma XT, trying to address transaction history growth. And then plasma debit trying to address the fungibility problem.
00:43:03.914 - 00:43:11.680, Speaker A: And then finally plasma cash flow and plasma unlimited. These are the kind of the frontier frontier which you'll hear about soon.
00:43:15.620 - 00:43:24.704, Speaker B: We did some user testing with IDEO actually, and we realized that people wanted functionality, they wanted smart contracts, they wanted a web two experience, not scalability.
00:43:24.832 - 00:44:02.260, Speaker A: And we scaled thousands of transactions per second with plasma. Like an annoying parent, I would hear, can it run uniswap? And the sad truth is, no, it couldn't at the time run uniswap. And so we went back to the drawing board and we thought of generalized plasma. This one sharded plasma. We only read one plasma ever.
00:44:04.150 - 00:44:25.842, Speaker B: One of the main research hurdles that we surpassed this year with plasma was the creation of generalized plasma. What generalized plasma allows is for some limited subset of what you can do with an ethereum smart contract. So you kind of have smart contracts on layer two, which is pretty dope.
00:44:25.906 - 00:44:48.686, Speaker A: So all this has like a function that just asks that if it can be exited. Oh, my god. But can it run uniswap? And once again, the sad answer was no, it cannot. We did not have the unstoppable smart contracts of ethereum layer one.
00:44:48.788 - 00:45:15.554, Speaker B: Generalized plasma was a lesson on many fronts. It honestly sucks ass to scrap something that you've been working so hard on for so long. But ultimately, it wasn't pragmatic. And we learned that ethereum smart contract devs want to build with ease, which means preserving the existing experience, not onboarding devs onto a whole new development paradigm. So because of those fundamental limitations, we scrapped the whole project and started anew we're very clever.
00:45:15.602 - 00:45:57.174, Speaker A: And so we came up with the name optimistic roll up. And so it turns out that within this trade off space, you can get general computation and you can get the no data withholding problem, the kind of unstoppable nature. And it turns out that the ability to have data on chain basically just gets around some very fundamental game theory issues that have to do with data availability. And so that gives you what really resembles smart contracts inside of layer two. But can it run uniswap? Yes. My gosh, of course it can run uniswap. First question down.
00:45:57.174 - 00:46:18.058, Speaker A: Let's go. All right, so what are we building? So we are here building optimistic Ethereum. Now. What is optimistic? Ethereum. In one exhale? Optimistic Ethereum is fundamentally a proposal to enable scalability on Ethereum. It's an upgrade to Ethereum. It's not a different thing.
00:46:18.058 - 00:46:35.060, Speaker A: That's the goal of the optimistic Ethereum network. It's the goal of optimism as a project, is to make Ethereum scale, not to become something different that tries to scale Ethereum. Optimistic Ethereum is just like Ethereum, but with better scalability. Ten to 100 x cheaper and secured by L one.
00:46:36.550 - 00:46:47.670, Speaker B: Okay, guys, I want you to tell me what optimism is with as many buzwords as possible. And it's okay if they don't make any sense. What is optimism?
00:46:50.170 - 00:47:07.760, Speaker A: Optimism is the layer two scalability stack for Ethereum. That's what it says on our website. Shit. Roll it up.
00:47:15.860 - 00:47:16.828, Speaker B: Okay, Carl.
00:47:16.924 - 00:47:17.472, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:17.606 - 00:47:19.872, Speaker B: What are you learning from this?
00:47:20.006 - 00:47:40.344, Speaker A: I'm learning the reality of George Hods'advice, of keeping things extremely simple and using the simplest tool to get the job done. The optimistic theory of design philosophy is keep it simple. I thought it was completely wrong.
00:47:40.462 - 00:47:41.720, Speaker B: Where did we fail?
00:47:42.060 - 00:48:11.256, Speaker A: We failed by having a feature that was not going to be used by our protocol or integrated by our protocol until it was complete. So we didn't have an Iterative strategy for building this feature. Instead, it was a full top down approach where we built out all the failure modes, all the edge cases. From day one, I think we've learned that premature optimization is a trap.
00:48:11.388 - 00:48:27.044, Speaker B: Yeah. So despite our best efforts to build an MVP every single time we went within a waterfall approach and then we slapped the Agile process over it and pretended like we were doing some fucking Agile MVP shit.
00:48:27.092 - 00:48:39.740, Speaker A: The optimistic Ethereum design philosophy keep it stupid simple and don't get wrecked. Plus, also aligning yourself with Ethereum as a whole.
00:48:39.890 - 00:48:40.876, Speaker B: What does that mean?
00:48:40.978 - 00:49:39.644, Speaker A: If you write a bunch of code that design an entirely new protocol, is it still Ethereum anymore? It's like a ship of theses type thing, right? We're not sitting here trying to go, oh, Ethereum doesn't work because it doesn't scale. We have to reinvent everything so that it scales it's to say, well, we did the best that we could at the time. We now understand how to scale underlying blockchain systems better and we have to apply those models to the existing. Amazingness that is Ethereum not running our code as a standalone bit of software that now people need to understand the depths of. We're running it as diffs against the existing tech stack. And our philosophy is like, very, very minimal diff. What really gets me going is, like, looking at that 200 line diff compiler, you know what I mean? Think of the complexity eliminated from early days of transpolation of your 6000 line JavaScript bytecode ingestor versus now you just write 200 lines of yule and it's done.
00:49:39.644 - 00:49:41.144, Speaker A: It's just phenomenal.
00:49:41.272 - 00:50:03.060, Speaker B: If you're wondering why it's taking us so damn long to write a 200 line compiler, that's because it takes so many more than 200 lines to get to the right 200 lines that maximizes functionality for minimum lines and that's just for the compiler. Optimistic. Ethereum is extremely complex because it has a lot of moving pieces and so it takes many, many iterations to get that right.
00:50:03.130 - 00:50:09.224, Speaker A: Just because there's not a large dip doesn't mean that you don't have to put a lot of thought into what that diff is.
00:50:09.422 - 00:50:30.684, Speaker B: None of this is perfect yet. We have to find the right balance between Pragmatism auditability, shipping speed and it's all trade offs. Code is really sensitive. Even very small changes can have very big breaking impacts. So one benefit of minimizing the diff is compatibility with a whole ecosystem of Ethereum developer tooling.
00:50:30.732 - 00:51:00.228, Speaker A: Ridiculous. For us to think that we could come in and catch up with five years of global open source development is just not practical. There's a reason people have been doing that work for years and years. It takes a lot of effort to make things good. There's something really awesome to be said for going from corporate to startups because as a nurse I felt like I knew everything on the ground, but I was a drop in. Not even a bucket.
00:51:00.244 - 00:51:06.830, Speaker B: But the Ocean used to work at a hedge fund. Why are you working here now?
00:51:07.680 - 00:51:34.870, Speaker A: This is where the action is. Holy shit. Come on. Thousand GWe, thousand guay oh my God. What was wrong there? If they don't fucking accept a thousand way transaction, I'm pissed. $20 for the other one and no computer. They got in.
00:51:34.870 - 00:52:14.096, Speaker A: Oh, that was a disaster. I went to my first Ethereum hackathon in 2017, ETH Waterloo. I was really worried that it's going to be these crypto anarchists, they're going to be unwelcoming to a noob like me. What I found was a community that was super inclusive and willing to help. I remember someone stayed up with me until 02:00 a.m. Walking through the Ethereum yellow paper. Yeah.
00:52:14.096 - 00:52:26.210, Speaker A: And I just think working at Optimism I can feel those same vibes of welcoming inclusivity. Yeah.
00:52:35.900 - 00:52:39.576, Speaker B: Why is solving fundamental problems in blockchain fun?
00:52:39.758 - 00:52:45.240, Speaker A: Solving fundamental problems in blockchain involves solving fundamental problems in computer science.
00:52:45.580 - 00:52:46.676, Speaker B: And that's fun?
00:52:46.798 - 00:52:51.070, Speaker A: Yeah, they're hard problems in computer science. Problems that haven't been solved before.
00:52:51.680 - 00:52:55.660, Speaker B: So why not do it at Google or something?
00:52:55.810 - 00:53:12.340, Speaker A: Because I don't really care about serving ads faster to people. I don't really wake up excited in the morning to track people on the internet. What do you wake up excited in the morning to do? Solve fundamental problems in blockchain.
00:53:18.410 - 00:53:19.990, Speaker B: Okay, prize.
00:53:22.410 - 00:53:27.082, Speaker A: Although I am a sucker for compilers so that would be good too. Some new compiler could be fun.
00:53:27.136 - 00:53:28.294, Speaker B: Like a viper compiler.
00:53:28.342 - 00:53:36.010, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Or Faye adding increased time to guests.
00:53:38.110 - 00:53:40.970, Speaker B: And participate in optimistic Ethereum.
00:53:41.050 - 00:53:42.398, Speaker A: Gosh guys.
00:53:42.564 - 00:54:20.698, Speaker B: We want to give back to the community as a whole so we have prizes dedicated to hacks that benefit Ethereum as a whole. This could be contributions to hard hat or Ethers or an EIP really, you name it. We also have prizes dedicated to hardcore helpful and mimi hacks. So it could be gethmods Viper compilers, ports of existing contracts, new layer, two native contracts, cross chain t shirt designs, riffs on our brand or our logo. Beautiful NFT artwork that we can gift to our community members. All of these count. I'm super looking forward to what you guys are building.
00:54:20.698 - 00:54:53.810, Speaker B: The distinction between categories is not that clear so just give it a shot. Oh and you should go to the website for the detailed prize information but we are putting fat stacks in each category so definitely go check it out. Okay, last note, carl is going to be giving a presentation later today if you want to get a little bit more in depth into how the technology behind Optimistic Roll Up works. So look out for his presentation at 10:30. A.m. PT.
00:55:02.170 - 00:55:56.554, Speaker A: Was extremely fun and entertaining to watch. Thank you so much the entire optimism team and that was super illustrative and just reminds us back when we can go back to the in person events that it global does and I can't wait to see so many more stories and teams like this. So that was super awesome to watch. I hope all of you got to learn a bit more context about optimism and optimistic roll ups in general as well. And just to summarize what Jing said at the end, the prizes are available on the website for beef global as well as the optimism specific domain. But the prizes for optimism are the most hardcore hack. We'll be giving $4,000 for that, the most helpful hack, $4,000 again for this, the best use of memes will get 1750 in total and the best good for the community hack category will have $3,000 being given away.
00:55:56.554 - 00:56:34.466, Speaker A: So hope you had a chance to enjoy that video as well. And we are ready to learn more about our next sponsor and that is ZK Sync. So let's watch the intro video by everyone. Really happy to be here and honored to greet you at the ETH Global Scaling Hackathon. And what a time to be in crypto in these crazy times. I just bought these two NFTs from a local OTC at a great discount to celebrate the coinbase going public. But let's start.
00:56:34.466 - 00:58:04.210, Speaker A: My name is Alex, I am CEO and co founder of MetaLabs and one of the co creators of ZK Sync which is the first EVM compatible ZK Roll Up. And ZK Roll Up is the most interesting scaling protocol l two scaling protocol because it has the same security properties as a layer one which is the only protocol which has this ability. And we are very excited about the EVM compatibility which is coming on testnet in May and will be released in production in August. Please come join us at a Zke EVM talk at Global ZK Summit in two weeks, I guess, where we're going to deep dive into the details how we did that, but ZK Sync is first and foremost a mission driven project. It started because we wanted to make a contribution into acceleration of mass adoption of crypto. We believe in freedom and we believe that freedom will be enhanced in all of the world through the mass adoption of crypto. And we are building our philosophy on the Ethereum's values of fairness, inclusion and resilience and we do everything around those values to support them technologically using the power of zero knowledge proofs which I think is the most underrated and the most promising technology for crypto for the coming decades.
00:58:04.210 - 00:59:16.380, Speaker A: So we are happy to support this hackathon with a number of prices. We're going to offer you mentorship. We will be there for you to answer questions about sync, about zero knowledge, proofs, share ideas, provide any feedback. And I just want to offer you one of the recipes how to pick great ideas to work on, which are going to catch a lot of attention and will lead to something really big and successful. And that is please think several moves ahead. Don't build something that solves an immediate problem, don't build something that is obvious today, build something that solves the problem which will become acute once the current problems are solved. And if we look back at history, we started Gksync a couple of years ago with DevCon Four where I first met my co founder and we discussed the idea back then, the fees on Ethereum were minuscule, the scaling was vaguely in the air, but it was not at all a burning problem.
00:59:16.380 - 01:00:27.870, Speaker A: However, we realized that if crypto is going to become big, and all the DApps which were being built back then, and those were the actual things that people needed, like DeFi and NFTs and all the protocols we now have and enjoy. Most of them were not available back then, and they were kind of obvious things to work on. But we thought, okay, if those are going to be big and get a lot of traction and get a lot of usage, 20 TPS is by far not going to be enough. So we started working on scalability also because zero knowledge proves we're becoming mature and it was clear that we will be able to use it and solve scalability breaking out of the scalability trillama for them. So yeah, we launched in summer last year, we are now live on Mainet with a ZK roll up for payments in May this year NFTs and trading is coming to mainet. And also we released a testnet for ZK Sync 2.0 with support for solidity and general EVM compatibility or EVM portability.
01:00:27.870 - 01:01:22.738, Speaker A: But this year, of course, we expect the summer of scaling with a lot of scaling solutions. Launching. And a lot of users who were excluded from the participation in Ethereum because of high fees are coming back from side chains, from other layer ones. And a lot of new users who got excited about NFTs. And all the crypto bots are coming to Ethereum as well. But let's think one step ahead again, once those solutions launch and all these users come back, what's going to happen? And retrospectively, if we look at what happened over the past year we will see a very interesting phenomenon. The number of users in Ethereum, the active DeFi users grew around dozen times but the fees grew quadratically proportional to that.
01:01:22.738 - 01:02:39.654, Speaker A: And the reason for this is induced demand, a term which describes what happens where you increase the capacity of some public good and a lot of more users coming and you have a lot of more new use cases and also trading just intensifies the existing use cases already intensified. And this is likely what's going to happen with roll ups. Unfortunately, the expectation is that we'll get 100 x more users with 100 x scalability boost but the reality might be closer that we just get a lot more trading again and some more use cases plus all the or multiplied by the number of OS users which will just eat up the scalability boost. And the prices currently roll up transaction prices are around one dollars, like more or less. If they grow ten x, 50 x, 100 x, we again are going to have a whole class of users who are excluded from the Ethereum ecosystem. And this is not cool. So we were thinking about this and we built a solution called ZK Porter which falls under the class of volusion and it combines the best properties of ZK roll up and validium.
01:02:39.654 - 01:03:00.298, Speaker A: And we encourage you to come to our talk on Friday at 05:00 Eastern where we're going to deep dive into that. And this is really interesting. I'm very excited about this. Please come to the talk. Really you're not going to regret it. But then there's going to be a next problem. That a lot of roll ups.
01:03:00.298 - 01:03:47.406, Speaker A: That launch will have centralized sequencers and this will jeopardize the resilience of these protocols. Because all of a sudden, we are subject to a lot of pressure. Maybe political pressure, maybe some economic or just some faulty behavior, which we will solve for Ziki sync with an L. Two consensus, which we're currently working on already. And then we think one more step ahead about the problem which will come after next, which is minor extractable value, which geopardizes fairness because the class of users will be in a lot better position than others using those values. So we will solve it again with cryptography and with zero knowledge proofs, with time locked encryption. So, yeah, looking forward to what you guys are going to build.
01:03:47.406 - 01:04:16.634, Speaker A: We are there for you. And yeah, have a lot of fun at this hackathon. Thank you. Amazing. So that was Alex talking to you about ZK Sync and ZK Porter. And just to summarize what they're doing for prizes, they'll be giving away 4000 USDC for the first place of ZkSync use. There'll be 2000 USDC dollars for second place.
01:04:16.634 - 01:05:02.326, Speaker A: And then four teams will win 500 USDC for the third place for the best use of ZK sending technologies. So with that, let's move on to our second ZK roll up sponsor and that is Starkware. And I'll let them share a bit about themselves. Hello everyone. So my name is Ellie Ben Sasson and I am co founder and president of Starquare. And I would like to tell you in this eight minute talk a little bit about the road we're taking from ZK Stark to StarkNet. And I would like to tell you that it goes through Cairo, which is a very cool programming language to which you're all invited to come and start programming in.
01:05:02.326 - 01:05:35.794, Speaker A: That's the purpose of our address to you in this hackathon. So StarkNet is going to be an ethereum like Stark rollup. It's going to have very low amortized gas per transaction. It's going to have tremendously good TPS transactions per second. So everyone wants to come over to it, right? Just a little bit more about what do we mean by Ethereum alike? It is going to be universal and support any smart contract logic that you wish. Just like on Ethereum, it's going to be permissionless. You can deploy smart contracts without asking permission from anyone.
01:05:35.794 - 01:05:58.858, Speaker A: Anyone can submit transactions in a decentralized manner. It's going to be fully decentralized. Both operators and provers are going to be decentralized. It's going to have some form of crypto economic incentives to the various participants in the network, the provers, the operators, developers and so on. Now to your question whether there will be a token. So the answer is no comment. Good.
01:05:58.858 - 01:06:48.650, Speaker A: So we'd like to get there and we're already on our way. So already in 2020, Starkware has deployed the foundations for StarkNet, and I'll talk about that in the next slide. And all of these foundations are already humming in practice, in production, and delivering scale for our customers. And we want to expand this to everyone. So during 2021, within a couple of months, we will give access to planets which is going to be run by a single operator and offer only a single app on it. By summer, we're going to have constellations that's going to allow multiple apps to compose with one another running on a single operator. And by 2022 we're going to reach the stage of Universe which is going to be this Ethereum like, decentralized multiple operator system permissionless for everyone.
01:06:48.650 - 01:07:27.426, Speaker A: Great. So a little bit about the foundations. The stuff we achieved so far, and I want to mention all of these things are right now operating in production and supporting our customers. So, first of all, we have Cairo, which is the programming language in which we express our logic. And this will be the programming language to be used also for getting scale and efficiency on StarkNet. We have Starkx, which is an application layer, and it will be ported and streamlined and ported over to become smart contracts over StarkNet. And currently we have three Starkx applications.
01:07:27.426 - 01:08:23.522, Speaker A: So think of these as three preliminary anchor smart contracts that are going to be ported over to StarkNet. And we have the framework of Stark provers, the most powerful provers in the world, with the leanest, fastest, meanest and most secure cryptography behind them that also reaches vastly greater scale than that obtained in production by any other proving system. So the three applications we have already running, the first one was diversify Spot trading, deployed already in production over the past summer. It reaches currently a TPS of 9000 for trading. So 9000 trades can be done per second. And all of this on Mainet Ethereum for payments, you can double that and have 18,000 transactions per second. A week ago, we deployed two systems immutable with NFT trading.
01:08:23.522 - 01:09:10.674, Speaker A: It is the only solution for scalable NFT trading right now that also sits on Ethereum. It gives you a price of not $40 per minting of an NFT, but rather one fifth of a cent. And during the very first day it went live, the amount of trading that went on on Immutable X was greater than all of the NFT related trading that took place on the week before that on Ethereum L one. And it didn't really affect gas prices all of this scale. The third system that was also deployed last week, two systems deployed in production within roughly two days. This is the first Stark roll up. It is dYdX and it supports perpetual and margin trading.
01:09:10.674 - 01:10:16.826, Speaker A: And it reduced the gas cost per trade by a factor of 50 X. Again, it's the first roll up for Stark that is right now running in production. So these three anchor systems are going to be part of StarkNet and they are all written in Cairo, which is the language that gives you the best access to using the power of Starks. So what are Starks and how do we get from Starks to StarkNet through Cairo? So ZK Starks are a family of very powerful cryptographic proofs that offer computational integrity. And computational integrity in the context of blockchains roughly means doing the right computation even when you're on an L two and no one else is watching. So ZK means that you get the privacy of zero knowledge proofs. The S in Stark stands for scalability, which means that the verification time per batch is only logarithmic or exponentially small in the amount of transactions going.
01:10:16.826 - 01:10:42.066, Speaker A: On in the batch while the proving time stays nearly linear. It is a universal system, meaning you can get it for any computation in the world. It is transparent. That's the T and stark. So no toxic waste, no trusted setup. It also gives you unlimited scale without reconfiguring the system. And it is based on lean and battle hardened cryptography, basically on the security of hash functions like Sha Two and Sha Three.
01:10:42.066 - 01:11:09.290, Speaker A: And it is post quantum secure. So how do you use it? Well, you take many transactions. So each one of these transactions, one of these little red squares, each one could be, let's say, an NFT being Minted. And instead of processing each one individually, you send them to approver. The prover doesn't have to be trusted. The math of Stark implies that it cannot produce a proof. The proof is this red pi that is generated.
01:11:09.290 - 01:11:58.562, Speaker A: The prover cannot get approved if he's not asserting a statement that is correct. And then there is a verifier that runs an exponentially small time and checks whether the proof is correct. And again, the math of it allows you to move from the current system on the right, which is verification by naive replay. So you need to check each one of these NFT Mints and each one of them may cost, let's say, $40 in gas. You can move to a system where basically you get one proof that can assert for 600,000 Mints being Minting being correct, and a new state of the system captured by a merkel route. And now you only need to verify the exponentially small proof and then you move to the new state of the system. So this is how all of our systems work right now in the Starkx mode, and they are written in Cairo.
01:11:58.562 - 01:12:22.938, Speaker A: A few words about Cairo. Cairo is our minimal viable language for getting production Stark systems. It follows the goldilocks principle. So it's the just right balance between the expressibility needed by developers and getting the Stark prover efficiency. It is very simple in its structure and virtual machine. It has only three registers and a minimal instruction set. But on the other hand, it is extremely powerful.
01:12:22.938 - 01:13:13.814, Speaker A: It supports functions, recursion branching, random memory access. Being production grade means that it comes with a very elaborate set of tools that is needed by developers, like a compiler, virtual machine, IDE extensions, tracer application code, examples and so on and so forth. So summing up, our applications currently have been written in Cairo. They support diverse business logic and sometimes this logic is quite complicated. And this is the best way for you to jump on the wagon. Or this train that is heading towards StarkNet and its next stop is going to be in summer 2021. So the next step is to join us on discord that's the left QR code and go and start tap into all the resources of Cairo using the right QR code.
01:13:13.814 - 01:13:51.626, Speaker A: So, thank you very much. Amazing. Thanks, Ellie. So you kind of got a quick overview of how Starquare and their work to StarkNet is going to make their debut here for this event. And what Starkware is going to be doing is they're going to be giving away a few prizes. So the first place for the Starkware prize will get $5,000 for the best use of integrations with the StarkNet Protocol. There will be two winners for the second place for two $3,000 prizes.
01:13:51.626 - 01:14:28.140, Speaker A: And then there's going to be three $1,000 3rd place winners. So we'll be sharing a lot more details on these specific prizes. They're already available on our prize page. And you also kind of got a gist of Cairo and how the starquare scaling solution works. And there'll be another talk for our summit later in the day going more into details of how Starquare works with Ethereum. So with that, we are ready to move on to our next two sponsors. So we have Scale and Connect, and we'll be sharing a quick video for both of them.
01:14:28.140 - 01:14:52.354, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. My name is Jack O'hollerin. I'm co founder of Scale, the Scale Network and the CEO of Scale Labs. Really excited to be here today. We've been doing Hackathons, or ETH global hackathons, since August of 2018. ETH Berlin was our first hackathon and we've done everyone since. So really pumped to be here to be supporting you.
01:14:52.354 - 01:15:46.438, Speaker A: And this hackathon in particular is very unique in that it goes for such a long period of time. So I think what that means is an opportunity to build even cooler things, get even more creative, put more effort and time into it. The other thing that I want to call out before we get into this, we've had the pleasure of having over 60 submissions on scale and we've given out over $60,000 worth of awards at ETH Hackathon. So I've seen a lot of these over the time, the last three years. And one thing I've noticed is that when you look at the teams building on hackathons and the sponsors that are there supporting them, you fast forward 18 to 24 months later, this is the future of crypto and decentralization. These things being hacked on become the things that are being used. So a lot of the things we see out in the wild today were actually ideas and thoughts and submissions at Hackathons before.
01:15:46.438 - 01:16:41.266, Speaker A: So it's a phenomenal way to build recognition as a developer, get awards, get awareness for your project or your team, but also to innovate and push the industry forward. So the people here doing this are the ones that will set forth the future of agenda for Ethereum and Web Three and DFI. Okay, without further ado, I'm going to get into some slides and show you more about awards and how to hack on scale. All right, here we go. So we'll get into the awards, talk a little bit about scale, talk about how to deploy on scale. I want to cover hackathon, support resources quickly, and then we'll close on a bit of a summary. All right, I'm really excited to say this is by far the biggest set of awards we've been able to give through scale, and that's because the scale token is now live.
01:16:41.266 - 01:17:18.026, Speaker A: The network is live. There's $2 billion staked into the Ethereum Main Net, which gives pool security to the scale network. And this is again coming from a community pool and going to developers. So there'll be five awards given. One will be the Denali Award, which is the name of the most recent upgrade this week. The scale network is upgrading, and you're going to see scale chains going live. You're going to see a lot of there's over 100 teams in the scale Innovator program that will be pushing out different applications in DFI Web Three, gaming NFT B to B disruptors, social music streaming, et cetera.
01:17:18.026 - 01:18:07.146, Speaker A: All right? And then we'll have three Kilmanjara Awards, which is the name of the first Main Net upgrade, first decentralized Main Net release last October. There'll also be one Partner Hack Award, where you build something on another partner at the hackathon or an ecosystem partner, integrate that with scale. We want to show off and award people that are using the Ethereum ecosystem. All right? So before I go further, I want to talk a little bit more about what it means to be an Ethereum Native MultiChain network. And so we need to then define what is a MultiChain network and what does it mean to be Ethereum native. So let's first talk about pooled security. And pooled security is a key component of a multi chain network.
01:18:07.146 - 01:18:36.310, Speaker A: You have a large set of nodes. They're secured. There's stake across all of those nodes. At any given time, a random subset is pulled into a blockchain. That blockchain, in this case of scale, those are called scale chains. And those nodes are not just randomly assigned, but they're rotated in a random fashion. All right? The cool thing about scale is the Ethereum network is actually orchestrating all of that assignment and rotation and stake and slashing, et cetera.
01:18:36.310 - 01:19:16.450, Speaker A: And there's already $2 billion plus in pooled security in the scale network at your disposal now that we are at the Denali upgrade ready for you to help support you push scale into the wild. All right? So that's a multi blockchain network where you have not just one blockchain that's shared. Each application has its own blockchain. And so when you deploy to scale, you get your own scale chain. When you get a scale chain at this hackathon, you get your own endpoint that you point to your own RPC port, and that's your scale chain. You don't share it with other hackers. Okay? And these are Blockchains on Demand, so to speak, or Ethereum on demand.
01:19:16.450 - 01:19:40.278, Speaker A: Now, this is not a new novel thing. We've been building this since 2017. Building a multi blockchain network or a MultiChain network. But there are a lot of them out there. I mean, you see these there are some big brands that are building MultiChain networks and I think they also see that the world's best tooling and developer traction is on Ethereum. So what they're doing is they're saying, hey, we have EVM compatibility. We're going to build a bridge to Ethereum.
01:19:40.278 - 01:20:19.074, Speaker A: And that's pretty much the extent of their integration. Scale, I want to call it, is very different. And that's why I'm passionate about this term Ethereum Native, because it means something. It's not just marketing the scale network through the scale manager actually is guided through the scale manager. So in the scale network, any orchestration, as I mentioned, which nodes go to which chains, any rotation of those nodes happens through the scale manager in conjunction with scale nodes. But smart contracts in the main net make that happen. In addition, there's network management.
01:20:19.074 - 01:20:58.818, Speaker A: That happens on ethereum. So there's an ERC 77 token that's called the SKL token that's on Ethereum. It lets you delegate from Ethereum to the scale network. And then when you do that, when you stake, that stake actually lives in the scale network and it's pooled security that supports decentralized applications, all right? That lives on ethereum. Same thing with any bounty awards, scale chain fees paid by developers for scale chains. Any sort of the inflation in the network that helps bootstrap the network and augments the fees in the first years, any sort of slashing. So if a node operator is malicious and they get slashed, that happens on Ethereum through scale manager.
01:20:58.818 - 01:21:42.402, Speaker A: Check it out on GitHub. Scale manager and the scale GitHub, it's a very complex set of smart contracts. And the other cool thing is when you use scale, you pay Ethereum. It's this modernized rev share model that is decentralized, which very cool way of partnering as opposed to competing and just kind of connecting over through a bridge. You want to pay for a scale chain, you have to pay in scale and you have to pay gas fees, send a scale token, you pay Ethereum and gas fees, et cetera. Scale also is, I think, doing really cool stuff with containerization. And these elastic blockchains or elastic shards can be selected in different sizes based off your needs.
01:21:42.402 - 01:22:31.006, Speaker A: So won't go too deep on this today. But it's one of the cool components here where every node has virtualized subnodes and a core that speaks back to the scale manager on Ethereum. All right? So again, deploy to scale, you can have subsecond block times, much larger block sizes, very great, easy user experience as if you were just deploying to another chain without a lot of complexity. But it's an Ethereum Native chain, all right? And so the way you at this hackathon, in order to do this one, you have to request a chain which I'll show you how to do in a second, it's very easy to deploy two lines of code. Then if you want to bridge, it's not a requirement. But if you want to bridge and show tokens moving back and forth between Ethereum and scale, you can use the scale IMA which is there at your disposal. Or another bridge.
01:22:31.006 - 01:23:22.966, Speaker A: Maybe you want to use Connect or something else, or maybe even you want to create a bridge. I think that would also be a cool award winner. And we'd love to see somebody do something creative or connect another bridge that exists to scale and show something happening that also I think, would be very creative. And then lastly, once you have your chain, do something cool in the ethos and spirit of Ethereum, show off these larger block sizes and smart contract again closing on awards. So there are $5,000 will be given in scale to the Denali winner. And hey, again, do something cool, do it in the spirit of Ethereum number. The next piece, three $2,500 winners, the Kilimanjaro Award.
01:23:22.966 - 01:23:56.402, Speaker A: Again, build something cool, have fun, get creative. And lastly, partner Hack award. And there's some integrations that already exist between Chainlink, the Graph Kinext and others covalent newscypher. So build something cool, integrate a partner. Ethereum is about the ecosystem, that is the strength of Ethereum. It's not just solidity, it's not just EVM, it's not just the security within the Ethereum mainnet. It's the developer ecosystem.
01:23:56.402 - 01:24:27.082, Speaker A: And scale wants to support that by also giving an award for someone that can show this integration between scale and another piece of the ecosystem. All right, so how do you learn more? The first step would be in a few hours. Today at 11:30, a.m PT. Chadwick Strange, VP of product for Scale Labs, will be giving a talk. So join that for a much deeper dive. You can go to Scale, chat to the Scale discord and learn all you need to know how to hack on scale.
01:24:27.082 - 01:24:51.800, Speaker A: Get connected to the team. You can also go to the discord run for this hackathon and we'll be there to support you as well. There's also a dev portal here link and a link to get a scale chain. Lastly, there's a scale store. It's a zero profit store, it's a community store. Anyone who hacks there'll be discount codes given when you get your scale chain. So please check that out.
01:24:51.800 - 01:26:01.680, Speaker A: All right, again, just want to close to say this is a phenomenal platform for for you to build something and the secure. All right, it looks like we're having some minor technical difficulties, but luckily we're at the tail end of what the scale prizes were. So I want to just quickly repeat what Jack was saying about scaled prizes and they are as follows. So, for the Denali Grant Prize, you'll be getting $5,000 in scale tokens. For the Kilomanjara Prize, you'll be getting three $2,500 in scale tokens. And for the best partner integration, there will be $2,500 in scale tokens that is over $12,000 in prizes being given by scale. And this is the largest they have done for an e global event.
01:26:01.680 - 01:26:36.916, Speaker A: And this is just absolutely incredible. So I hope you had a chance to learn a bit more about how scale is structured from this quick talk. There's also going to be another talk during our summit in a couple of hours by Chadwick going in more depth around how scale works under the yeah, hopefully that was informative. And with that, we are ready to move on to our next talk for our next sponsor video, and that is Connect. And we'll be sharing what Connects has to say momentarily. Hi everyone. My name is Arjun.
01:26:36.916 - 01:27:22.404, Speaker A: I'm one of the founders of Connects. Welcome to Scaling Ethereum. Connect is a protocol for communicating between different layer two ecosystems so that's Roll ups, side chains, any other kind of EVM compatible chain, and then eventually also like non EVM compatible Turing complete systems like ZK Roll Ups. Connect is basically a network of liquidity providers called routers. Those routers hold liquidity pools on different chains similar to uniswap LPs and they allow you to swap value between them. You can even do more interesting things like pass call data between as part of these swap interactions. That allows you to call a contract on a given chain from another chain.
01:27:22.404 - 01:27:57.792, Speaker A: So it kind of looks like a cross chain meta transaction pattern. Connect is live today. We've been live for the last few months. We've been working with pretty closely with the Polygon ecosystem XDI and a bunch of other early kind of L two pioneers. And then now we're hoping to go live with Arbitrum optimism soon and then ZkSync as well when it rolls out connect works. So a few examples of where Connect works right now. So Decentral Games is a metaverse casino that exists on Polygon.
01:27:57.792 - 01:28:44.416, Speaker A: Decentral Games uses Kinext to onboard in and out of Polygon from Ethereum. One of the great things about Connects is that because you have this swap of assets on one chain for another chain, you can bypass entry and exit windows completely. So Polygon has a six minute onboarding and a three hour offboarding time normally from Ethereum. And then with Connects that ends up being pretty much instant. Users can kind of just do this in a single session. So particularly for people who are not necessarily as familiar with Ethereum and particularly like the nuances of Ethereum bridges, connect ends up making that experience a lot more seamless. Another way that people are using Kinext is direct layer two to layer two interactions.
01:28:44.416 - 01:30:01.340, Speaker A: And we think this is an incredibly powerful space that is going to be really valuable in the future because, well, to be honest, the ETH is just so incredibly expensive right now that it prices out a lot of different types of activities. So we've had folks say that they have funds stuck on XDI or BSc or eventually things like arbitrary and optimism and the funds are not really worth bridging out of the chain. But if you can move them directly between layer two, then they become interesting to play with. And right now that threshold is kind of like forty dollars to fifty dollars, which is actually a pretty significant amount of money when you're not just being like an absolute D 5d gen we found that this layer two to layer two. These swaps are actually really great for people who want to ape into protocols from things like finance, because there's a very clear and easy path to go from binance chain to move liquidity off of binance chain and onto the actual ethereum layer two ecosystem. And the last kind of user flow, the last kind of way to use Connects that we're most excited about is basically this cross chain metatransaction pattern. So Connect has the ability to build what are called withdrawal helpers.
01:30:01.340 - 01:31:11.808, Speaker A: Basically we have like middleware contracts that you can deploy between the Connect contracts and then whatever else you want to do outside of Connect. And then you can pass call data into Connect when you make a cross chain transaction. And by creating withdrawal helpers like this, you're actually able to call any contract directly from Connect and do that across chains without having to pay gas on the receiving side. So what this looks like is it's kind of similar to a meta transaction relayer pattern where you only need funds you're able to pay for a transaction that normally would cost ETH gas, but only using USDC or Dai. And in this case, you're able to pay for a transaction on a receiver side chain only using funds on the sender side chain. So for instance, like paying for an Arbitrum transaction using ETH from Arbitrum rather than ETH from an Arbitrum transaction on optimism, paying only ETH from Arbitrum rather than ETH from optimism. Great example of a project that's building with this technology right now is Superfluid.
01:31:11.808 - 01:32:18.084, Speaker A: So Superfluid is a cross chain money streaming protocol, or a money streaming protocol more generally. And then they're building cross chain money streams using Connect by enabling users to be able to set up these money streams on different chains. We think there's some really interesting new kinds of places to explore here. So for instance, you can build fully atomic cross chain Dex aggregators, which we think are incredibly powerful and are probably what dex aggregators would look like in the future, where you're not just aggregating from all of the AMMS on a single chain, but you're also aggregating across a bunch of different chains. You can use the same kind of pattern to build things like cross chain lending, cross chain yield aggregation, potentially even like crosschain dow interactions and things like that. There's a couple of ways to integrate Connects. Today we have a SDK, so we have a widget that looks like this that you can pretty much just drop directly to your UI that is extremely fast to integrate and we have great instructions for that in our docs.
01:32:18.084 - 01:33:12.116, Speaker A: We also have a lower level SDK that powers this. So in case you don't want to use our UI or you want to do more complex behaviors like the cross chain contract calls that we just talked about, you'd be able to pass those more detailed call data calls directly into the SDK. Both of these resources for integrating both of these mechanisms are available in our docs. And for the duration of this test, we're actually hosting routers on testnet specifically for this. So if you have a project that you're building on top of us and you don't want to have to go through the headache of hosting a router and supplying liquidity and things like that, we have some publicly available routers that you could use. We also have some additional resources. So we've put together like a list of things that could be helpful to hackers in a hacker kit.
01:33:12.116 - 01:33:52.256, Speaker A: You can find that at Connects Network, slash Scaling ETH and then of course, you can also find us and ping us anytime in the Sponsor Connect discord chat on the ETH Global chat. We also have our own Discord if you want to join it. We are super responsive there as well. And you can find the link to that on our landing page, connects Network. And then lastly, we're giving out a bunch of prizes as part of this. So we're giving out 1500 each to the best applications that implement the Widget SDK, best applications that use this cross chain metatransactions pattern. We're looking for a team to build teams that build metrics and powerful data analytics against our network.
01:33:52.256 - 01:34:27.020, Speaker A: So we're exposing the process of exposing that currently. And if you're interested in that, definitely come talk to us. And then we're doing a couple of joint bounties with the graph and optimism where if you build using both of us, you would be eligible for those prizes. Yeah, that's basically it from our end. Thank you guys so much for coming to Scaling Ethereum and really excited to potentially work with you and good luck in the hackathon. Thanks so much Arjun for that intro. And just to sum up, the prizes for Connect, there is going to be $3,000 being given for the metrics related hack.
01:34:27.020 - 01:34:56.990, Speaker A: It's $1,500 available for the crosschain DAP submission. And the best use of a cross chain transaction on Connects will also get $1,500. And there'll be two $750 prizes for the best Widget or SDK integration. So that's a summary of the Connects prizes. And then we have a few more sponsors who would like to tell us about their excitement to join this event. And we'll be doing Protocol Labs and seller together here. Hello.
01:34:56.990 - 01:35:27.412, Speaker A: Welcome to Scaling Ethereum. I am Dietrich Ayala, and I'm the IPFS ecosystem lead at Protocol labs. Protocol Labs is an open source research, development and deployment laboratory. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, lipidA, P and a whole bunch more. We aim to make human existence orders of magnitude better through the technologies we're developing. We're a fully distributed company. Our team of more than 100 members works remotely and in the open to improve the Internet, humanity's most important technology.
01:35:27.412 - 01:36:33.412, Speaker A: As we explore advances in computing and related fields. Protocol Labs has four prize options for scaling all the things which it may choose to split up amongst multiple winners if too many of you build amazing projects. Our first prize the NFT Metadata Updater, $1,875 file coin mo minting Mo problems. Right now, everybody's minting NFTs and figuring out how to manage them. There aren't a lot of tools or services for managing large numbers of NFTs or even personal collections being able to update metadata dynamically and in bulk across multiple assets. So this is a prize for the best method for managing signed permissioned timestamped updates to NFT metadata stored on IPFS via any L two chain the chain of your choice. Our second prize filecoin Turbo Retrieval, $1,875 in filecoin for the best method of bundling, managing, warming up, preflighting, or otherwise speeding up the payment channel creation process for easy mass retrieval from the Filecoin network.
01:36:33.412 - 01:37:37.036, Speaker A: Our third prize Sailing the Seas of CIBS, $1,875 in filecoin. Right now, you're publishing everything to IPFS, but where's your stuff? What is it all? So this prize is for the best tool, the best service website library for working with and managing visualizing large collections of IPFS CIDs. Our fourth prize the Filecoin Super Disputer, $1,875 in filecoin. Disputing Optimistic Window Proof of Spacetime proofs is a fun and profitable hobby that will also impress your friends. But how to show that off? This is the best prize for a disputer history, visualizer a leaderboard, or some other way of understanding what the set of potential disputes that you could take on are, who's disputing them, and any other way to be able to manage and help the dispute process and allow people to participate in this opportunity. Thank you very much for listening. Thank you for joining the ETH Global Scaling Ethereum Hackathon Protocolabs is very proud to be part of another amazing event.
01:37:37.036 - 01:38:17.948, Speaker A: We are looking forward to the things that you build with Ipfest, Lipidp, and Filecoin. If you have any questions, join us in the Protocolab Sponsor Channel. We're here to help you and answer your questions and make the things that you build even more awesome. Looking forward to evaluating and judging your projects, and we'll see you on the Internet. Hi, this is Mo from Saturday. It's great to meet you all at the Scaling Ethereum Hackathon. Today we're bringing a new project called Layer Two Finance for you to use and actually build on top of.
01:38:17.948 - 01:39:37.248, Speaker A: This project is really about bringing access due to DFI for everyone. And just to give a quick intro, if we look at the entire DFI landscape, it's almost like a city where your wallet is basically your home and you have different kind of a DFI shop you can go and park your money at and earn yield. The problem about this particular DFI city is that right now, the only way of transportation is this kind of a super expensive limo service, which is an l one transaction and ideally for any kind of a modern city. We would expect to have some pretty good public transportation system where people can aggregate together and go to certain destination and split the cost. This is essentially the idea of layer two finance which is providing a trust free D five public transportation system through layer two roll up scaling architecture. We have already launched on testnet and currently there are quite a lot of activity on this testnet, but most notably we're seeing about 80 times lower cost comparing to directly using layer one D five protocols. The good thing about layer two finance here is that it really is a composable product where it doesn't require layer one DFI strategies or layer one D five protocols to migrate to a different chain.
01:39:37.248 - 01:40:55.364, Speaker A: Instead it only require a simple connector to bridge the layer two liquidity back to layer one. And this is what we call a strategy adapter. Now this hackathon is really about bringing innovation on that strategy adapter layer and we're providing a $7,500 prices to build with a layer two finance strategy SDK to connect and combine different strategy protocols and D five protocols into noble strategies. The first price being $3,000 and we have three runner ups of 1500 each. We're hoping to see some really noble combination of D five protocols in these strategies with a fully functional strategy contract built and to find out how to build the most easy, the easiest solution is probably just join the discord and follow us on Twitter. And we also have a GitHub of course, but we will always send notification in the discourse channel and also publish our workshop talk about how to connect the existing D five protocols into this layer two finance product. And we'll have a summit later today to talk a little bit more in detail on how this is realized in layer two roll up construct.
01:40:55.364 - 01:41:44.568, Speaker A: Well, looking forward to your submission and good luck with the hackathon. Thank you so much. Protocol laz and Sellers so just to quickly summarize their prize protocols will be giving NFT 1875 in filecoin tokens for the NFT metadata updater hack, another 1875 in filecoin tokens for a Turbo retrieval hack for filecoin which relates to scaling. They also want to help give prizes for anybody who's helping scale CID retrievals and also a 1875 InfoGrain price for a super disruptor category winner. The details all of which are on our prizes page. And to summarize seller they'll be giving first place $3,000 for the best seller integrations and there'll be three $1,500 runner ups for the best use of seller. Protocol.
01:41:44.568 - 01:42:09.616, Speaker A: So with that, we have ZK Swap and loop ring up next and we'll share their videos with you momentarily. Hello global hacker. This is ZK Swap. This is a quick video overview of what Tk swap is. The ticket swap is a layer 02:00, a.m. Dex based on ticket rollout we launched in February 14, 2021. It's been three months since our launch.
01:42:09.616 - 01:42:42.444, Speaker A: We already have 1.5 billion in TVL and 1 billion in liquidity and 150,000,000 in trading value. Ticket swap has payment and layer two trading and liquidity mining and it's based on ticket roll up. It uses validity proof instead of fraud proof. It has onchain data and there's no extra period. It has low gas fee and low latency. We have about 100 times the capacity of ethereum and the gas cost, the transaction cost is one 50th compared to layered.
01:42:42.444 - 01:43:14.872, Speaker A: There are one solutions and the confirmation is instantaneous. The technical challenges and innovations we encountered while implementing ZK swap. So the circuit complexity is definitely one thing. As the complexity of the business logic increases, the block size and the proof time also increases. So we had to spend a lot of time optimizing our circuits and our proof infrastructure. We implemented a GPU algorithm to generate approved and we achieved a three time improvement using our GPU implementation. And the other technique we used is aggregation proof.
01:43:14.872 - 01:44:08.744, Speaker A: Instead of generating one decade knowledge proof per block, there's a way to generate a single proof for multiple blocks, so decreases the proofing cost on chain as well, because we can verify multiple blocks with a one single aggregation proof. And we also look into a lot of data compression of our onchain data on chain. Data storage is definitely the biggest component of decay roll up cost. A little bit about our 2021 roadmap in Q two of 2021, we're going to launch version two and we'll support token listing for anyone, for users, and we're going to keep working on our proof ticket proof efficiencies so we can improve our TPS as well. And we plan to launch a governance token for TKS. And in Q three we're going to add stablecoin swap. So going to implement different curves for stablecoins and for example, trading between different types of BTCs.
01:44:08.744 - 01:44:48.692, Speaker A: In Q four, we'll be looking into supporting smart contracts on layer two for the hackathon. There are prices we are offering for Arbitrage tools. So you could implement Arbitrage purely on layer two, or you could also implement some sort of cross platform Arbitrage strategies between DK swap and say, a centralized exchange. The other thing is you could possibly implement some sort of DeFi protocol based on GK swap LP tokens. So the Tk swap LP tokens are available on layer one. The liquidity providers, they deposit their assets on layer two, but they're a corresponding LP token on layer one. And this is something that you could use to build some sort of DeFi.
01:44:48.692 - 01:45:10.812, Speaker A: Here's our links like our official media Twitter Telegram discord and you can follow us on Twitter digest one official. That's it. Thanks. Hello. My name is Daniel Wang. I'm the founder and CEO of Loopring. Welcome to this haikasan.
01:45:10.812 - 01:46:00.400, Speaker A: I wish everybody can enjoy this event, learn something new, make friends and deliver something cool. As one of the sponsors of this event, I would like to introduce Loopring and our two challenges for you. Loopring is a CK roll up based layer two scalability solution. But we are not a general purpose layer two. We are a deck specific layer two for transfers, AMM swap and auditbook trades. We also offer a smart wallet powered by social recovery. So with the wallet, you don't have to manage your private key, you don't have to do backups.
01:46:00.400 - 01:46:36.824, Speaker A: We have two challenges for you. One is front end challenge. We want to build a blockchain explorer for Prinzeki roll up. The other one is related to our cross blockchain bridge or cross layer two bridge. I want to share a few slides with you regarding the bridge. There are three small component of the bridge. The first one is what we call a flight deposit.
01:46:36.824 - 01:47:48.588, Speaker A: So basically on layer one you can mint some token out of thin air and then deposit to Loop ring layer two. And then at the end of layer two block, you have to withdraw the same amount of token and return them to layer one to burn. The second one is a breeze. The breeze allow multiple user on layer two to transfer tokens to one single account on layer two and then withdraw the token to layer one, interact with DFI and then optionally return another token back to layer two and redistribute those tokens to users. The third one is the converter, which is a special implementation of the bridge so that we can optimize the layer one footprint a little bit. So these are very powerful tools that you can use to bring interoperability to Loop ring. So again, I wish everybody to have fun at this great event.
01:47:48.588 - 01:48:38.780, Speaker A: Breck and myself will be here to help. Thank you. Awesome. So that was ZK Swap and Loop ring. And just to quickly summarize their prizes, ZK Swap is giving $2,000 prize for the Arbitrage tool, the best use of Arbitrage tool, $1,500 prize for an aggregator related hack and $2,500 for the lending category related hack. And Loop Ring is giving about $5,000 in prizes and the first place gets 2500, the second place gets 1500 and the third place gets about $1,000 for the best use of Loopering protocols in their hack. With that we are moving on to Raiden and the graph.
01:48:38.780 - 01:49:09.628, Speaker A: So excited for them to quickly share about their prizes and themselves. Hello everyone. This is Jacob from the Raiden team. Today I'll give you a brief introduction of Raiden and the prizes that we have for the scaling ethereum hackathon. The Raiden network is a payment channel network. It consists of off chain channels that allow for fast transfers because we don't have to wait for the blockchain. It scales linearly with the amount of users using the system.
01:49:09.628 - 01:50:12.092, Speaker A: It is very suitable for high frequency token transfers and in this hackathon specifically, we'll focus mostly on the Light client. So Raiden is a good fit for you when you want to do many frequent transfers, you want instant finality on those transfers and you want to work with a simple API that lets you focus on building things. So the prices and challenges that we offer for this hackathon are $2,000 in RDN for the best hack that uses the written like client SDK to power payments. So this is a very broad category and if you're not entirely sure what you want to build, we also have a list of ideas and inspiration that you can get from us in Discord. So this is probably for you if you have some idea that includes payments. Secondly, we have $2,000 in RDN for the best hack that ports Radiant to a roll up solution or a side chain. So this could be putting Radian on optimism or putting Radiant on XDI.
01:50:12.092 - 01:51:06.976, Speaker A: Optimism is probably harder than putting it on XDI. So for this, if you do XDI, we would also like to see some good tooling around interfaces and bridges for Xdai to Ethereum and the other way. Then there's $2,000 worth of RDN for the best hack that builds new front end for the Light client or rebuilds the current one. So we would like to see a front end that focuses very much on making it easy and simple to do payments in Raiden for all the categories. We also reward $500 in RGN for the runner up submissions. If you're looking for some resources, inspiration and support, you can find us in Discord and ask whatever you want. We can brainstorm some ideas together.
01:51:06.976 - 01:51:48.460, Speaker A: We also have a list of concrete ideas and you can check out the workshop that Andre did when you want to get started building on the SDK quick intro to the team. We have Andre, Paul, Tora Talel and myself and we will be following in Discord for this hackathon and we'll be very happy to help you out. If you have any questions, we are here to help. And lastly, I'll just mention that we also have a grant program that could be relevant for continued collaboration after the hackathon. That's all for me. Thank you very much and good luck and have fun hacking.
01:51:50.560 - 01:52:26.312, Speaker B: Hi there. My name is Eva Baylin and I'm director at the Graph Foundation. For those of you who don't know, the Graph is the global querying and indexing layer for web3 and querying any blockchain data at all. We're so excited to be sponsoring scaling Ethereum and helping you hackers build better and more sustainable applications. To learn more about the Graph, I suggest you go to thegraph.com docs where you can learn how to deploy a subgraph, what a subgraph even does, and even learn more about our network and how to become an indexer. Now, we have a few bounties for this hackathon, so listen up.
01:52:26.312 - 01:53:21.260, Speaker B: The first bounty will be one prize of 1500 die for the best use of one of the following existing subgraphs by one of the other sponsors of this hackathon. So that includes the Rarible subgraph, the ENS subgraph, the Matic or Polygon subgraph, uniswap subgraph, or the Ave subgraph. And again, you can learn more about how to use these subgraphs by checking out our docs. You can also head to the Discord the Graph.com discord to speak with one of the other engineers in our community that's built subgraphs before and even talk to other DAP developers who are currently querying Active subgraphs. The cool thing about building a subgraph is that it's part of an open source crowdsource community and so you're contributing to the global graph of data, not just using it yourself. And that's also the cool thing for you as an integrator, if you're not interested in actually building the subgraph yourself for whatever reason, you can use an existing one.
01:53:21.260 - 01:54:09.196, Speaker B: And that means that you're reducing your own redundant back end work. You don't need to set up a server database, and you also don't need to maintain it. But we do encourage you to build a subgraph for your use case. And so that might be as simple as making aggregations, just combining data between smart contracts, tracking events, or call data really anything to get your app functioning. Some of the other bounties we have are one prize of 1000 die to the best new subgraph, and we also have three prizes of 1500 die each to the best new subgraph on a scaling solution that's supported by the Graph's hosted service. Lastly, we have two prizes of 250 die each for the best memes related to the Graph and scaling ethereum. Lastly, if you want to learn more about how to deploy a subgraph on an EVM chain, you can tune in at 04:00 p.m.
01:54:09.196 - 01:54:45.492, Speaker B: Eastern to see Dave, a blockchain engineer at Edge and Node, and he can ask a lot of questions and just hear more about what happens behind the scenes. If you want to learn more about the Graph itself, I'd also suggest checking out the Forum. So Forum the Graph.com is where you can see a lot of our ongoing community work, whether that's a governance proposal for the network or maybe even information and resources around subgraph development. You can also check out example subgraphs by heading to thegraph.com Explorer. This is where you can literally find the endpoints for some existing subgraphs.
01:54:45.492 - 01:55:06.300, Speaker B: You can search to see what's been deployed already, and you can also play around in the playground so you can test out GraphQL queries before committing to it. If you want to learn more, I'd suggest also following us on Twitter where we keep up with announcements on multi blockchain, any other integrations and our progress on the network. Excited to see you guys hack. Bye.
01:55:08.500 - 01:55:46.552, Speaker A: Those were two awesome, amazing intros from Raiden and the graph. And just to summarize their prizes, Raiden will be giving $2,000 in Raiden tokens for the lite client SDK use. Anybody who's porting to roll up or L. Two with Raiden will get $2,000 in Raiden tokens as well. And a like client integration on the front end side with Raiden will also win a $2,000 prize in Raiden tokens. And then there'll also be a run up category for each of those getting $500 each. And for the Graph, the best existing subgraph related hack will get $1,500 in die.
01:55:46.552 - 01:56:14.660, Speaker A: The best new subgraph that gets published will get 1000 die. The best new layer, two subgraph that gets worked on, there'll be three prizes for 1500 die and the best graph meme related submission will get 2250 die in prizes. So with that, I want to move on to our last set of our sponsors and we'll have Polygon and Compound Grains program share some of their interesting perspectives.
01:56:17.640 - 01:56:52.604, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, this is Muskan. I lead developer relations at Polygon. So really excited to be your sponsoring Ethereum scaling hackathon. And I'm sure all the hackers participating in the hackathon will definitely enjoy experiencing all the scaling solutions and building upon them because scaling is the need of the time. Right now I'm really excited to see some amazing hacks coming out of the hackathon. So yeah, let's see. So telling you more about Polygon.
01:56:52.604 - 01:57:54.390, Speaker B: So Polygon is basically a well structured, easy to use ethereum scaling platform. So Polygon, which is previously matic was found in 2017 with this hybrid POS plus plasma kind of chain approach. And since then we have seen good great amount of adoption on a POS and plasma chain. So basically these chains are a commit chain to Ethereum. So by commit chain what I mean is that every like 256 blocks the merkel route transactions to Ethereum. By this what I mean is that the chains are tethered to Ethereum chain. And just seeing in our journey ahead, going deeper into this scaling spectrum, we realized that there have been a lot of solutions coming up like ZK roll ups and optimistic roll ups and there might be more solutions coming in the future.
01:57:54.390 - 01:58:38.690, Speaker B: So there's no one size fits all scaling solution. So developers have to keep on learning about the solutions and see which solution will be applicable to their kind of use case. So just working on seeing all these problems and working upon them. So we just came up with the idea of Polygon. So Polygon is basically a kind of a layer to aggregator. I can say be it like ZQ roll ups, be it optimistic roll ups or be it any other standalone chains. So you'll be find everything on one platform.
01:58:38.690 - 01:59:55.556, Speaker B: So now it depends on the developer like which kind of solution that developer needs for his kind of application. So he's working on some NFT kind of solution so there might be another he might need POS kind of solution. He's working on some DeFi application so he might need another optimistic roll up kind of solution so he'll be able to find every solution on one platform. So basically Polygon is a sys army knife for Ethereum Scaling. And of course this will take a little time to develop, but right now the production ready chains are like Matic, POS and plasma chains which is well adopted chains by the ecosystem. Right now if I say there are more than 200 plus applications which are being developed on these POS and plasma chains, I think you guys also really enjoy building on these chains because it's really simple to develop. We usually say internally that if you are an Ethereum developer, you're already a polygon developer because all the toolings and functionalities which are compatible with Ethereum chain that are compatible with polygon as well and it's really simple to deploy.
01:59:55.556 - 02:00:49.592, Speaker B: You just need to change one RPC and it's done. You don't need to change any other things, you just need to change one RPC in your contract and you are done. That's it. Now telling you about the bounties. So we usually like to keep it very open and whatever you want to build, just let your imagination run while and you could build anything because it's really cheap to experiment things with Polygon because gas fees is really less so you could build anything. But there are some of the ideas which I would like to share. So you could build some marketplace set up using Azora contracts and polygon, any kind of minter to move to mint NFTs directly on polygon and an NFT bridge which can be used to move these NFTs from Polygon to Ethereum main chain.
02:00:49.592 - 02:01:40.904, Speaker B: Then you could work on some folks of popular DeFi protocols like balancer curve or any other protocol you want to work upon. Next is some DeFi tooling like something like yield calculators like DeFi analytics pages for polygon. Other can be bridge for the FX portal. The last is use superfluid on Matic to build the scalable streaming money applications. These are some of the ideas I would like to share, but it's quite open and if you want to work upon anything else and make use of polygon speed and scalability, just feel free to do that. Sky is the limit here. We'll be awarding 7500 USDT to hackers which are building their hacks on Polygon.
02:01:40.904 - 02:01:55.596, Speaker B: So this is the distribution. Yeah, that's all from my end, I guess. And let's see. I'm really excited. What kind of amazing hacks will come out of this Ethereum Scaling hackathon?
02:01:55.708 - 02:02:57.556, Speaker A: So really thanks to hey everyone, I'm Adam from Compound. I'm the Developer relations Lead. My job is to help you out with building your Ethereum related development projects that include the Compound protocol, compound grants, is sponsoring this year's Scaling Ethereum hackathon with ETH Global. And if you haven't heard of Compound, it's a protocol for supplying and borrowing of assets on the Ethereum blockchain. So developers can include interest rates in their applications by using the Smart contracts. Popular apps that use the Compound protocol are Argent, Pool, Together, Exodus Xerion, and there's a bunch more at Compound Finance, developers can learn more at Slash Docs. We have method documentation for all the Smart Contracts API Docs, as well as open source code and blog posts that explain how to include the protocol in your app.
02:02:57.556 - 02:03:46.244, Speaker A: Lots of education materials there. You can also join us in discord at Compound Finance. Discord, there's a development channel where you can ask questions and bounce ideas off the community and they'll help you out there getting started with your project. So this hackathon's, Compound Bounties will include projects that scale the Compound protocol. The current challenges for users are high gas fees with supply and borrow and also claiming comp as well as governance proposals and voting. So projects that implement general compound protocol, gas savings or zero knowledge technology or layer two will be considered for the Compound Bounties. So you can join us again at Compound Finance Discord and we'll help you out there.
02:03:46.244 - 02:04:05.796, Speaker A: You can chat with us and yeah, we're always here to help. So we're excited to be a part of Scaling Ethereum and we can't wait to see the creative projects that you all are working on. Amazing. So. Thank you, Muskan. And Adam. Those were the last two videos we wanted to share from our sponsors.
02:04:05.796 - 02:04:59.804, Speaker A: And just to summarize, the polygon prize, they were giving away over $6,000 for the best use of polygon. And the matic network in the first place will get 2500. There'll be two $1,500 2nd place prizes and three $1,000 or two $1,000 3rd place prices. As for Compound, we encourage you to check out the list of Open Bounties and ideas that are being proposed by Compound Grants and they're here to support this event and really get in the zone of helping out and seeing how we can make DFI and Compound more possible on the L two side. Now of course, those were some of just the sponsors that were able to share their prizes and tell us about themselves directly, but there are a handful of other ones that are also doing prizes. And I'll just quickly give you a heads up on who they are and what's being given out by each of these companies. So Taurus is giving away $7.5
02:04:59.804 - 02:05:19.036, Speaker A: thousand in prizes. Ave will be giving away $5,000 in prizes. Superfluid is also giving 5000 in prizes. Both Chain Link and New Cipher are giving $5,000 in prizes. For the best integrations for all these protocols. Covalent is doing $3,000 in prizes. Teller is also doing $3,000 in prizes.
02:05:19.036 - 02:05:56.472, Speaker A: Zapper is doing $4.5 thousand in prizes. 1inchh Exchange is doing $5,000 in prizes. The secret network is doing 5000 in prizes and ENS Integration prize is $1,000 in total. And there's a few more sponsors that are finalizing the total numbers for their prizes. So we'll update that in the prizes page. And just so you have all of this handy, all of the prizes and that information with the details for what it means to win a prize and how you qualify and how do you use anywhere from documentation to the details of each of these protocols is available at Scaling ethgobal co prizes.
02:05:56.472 - 02:06:42.430, Speaker A: This will take you to the Info Center on the Prizes page and you can see all these details of $200,000 plus in prizes there directly. So we are ending the intro and the kickoff for the hackathon. I want to wish everybody again a happy hacking and we'll be switching gears to our scaling Summit. So that said, I want to quickly just say hello to everybody who joined in just now for our summits. Scaling Ethereum is a three to four week long event that's happening. We'll be covering a lot of talks and summits related to scalability and what's happening in the Ethereum ecosystem. And there's also a hackathon that goes on for three weeks where people will be doing a lot of interesting ideas and experimentation related to scalability and layer two.
02:06:42.430 - 02:07:28.640, Speaker A: My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETHGlobal, and I'll be your MC for today, especially with all of our Summits. And just as a quick note for everybody joining in, we are using ETHGlobal TV as our platform to watch all of our Summit content. So I really encourage all of you who just joined in to sign into this page so you can ask us questions that we can relay directly to our speakers in real time. And also, for everybody who has signed in, we'll be monitoring everybody who signs up and giving out NFT POAP tokens for attending this summit today. So all that said, there's a quick overview of what the next few hours look like. We're going to have it talks about the high level categorization and the works of roll ups by Patrick McCrory.
02:07:28.640 - 02:08:22.648, Speaker A: Then we'll jump into how optimism and arbitram are set up internally. Then we're going to have a quick panel about optimistic rollups, where Patrick and our previous two talks will be doing A-Q-A. Then we'll learn about scale and ask specific chains and then transitioning into how matic and their scaling solution works. Then we're going to learn about what it means to do withdrawals and security for assets in optimistic roll up scenarios. Then we'll also learn about how swaps and liquidity providers can play a role in the L two ecosystem, especially as we think about cross L two transfers with Connect. Then Mo from Seller will talk about layer two, finance their approach to understanding how we can make D five better on layer two. Then we'll have Alex talking about ZK porter and ZK Sync and how they are doing their ZK roll ups.
02:08:22.648 - 02:09:05.256, Speaker A: Then we'll have Tom from Starquare talk about their road to StarkNet and making it easy for everybody to really make quick and cheap transactions on mainnet. And then to sum up all of this, we're going to have a talk by David on Synthetics, who have been live on an Lt solution for quite some time, and they'll be sharing their experiences and the challenges that went into porting synthetics over from mainnet to optimism. So, without further ado, I'd like to welcome our first talk of today. Patrick McCrory is going to be talking about what are roll ups, and he'll be doing a really amazing talk on how everything works in this world. So, Patrick, welcome and I'll let you kick off with your presentation. Awesome. Thanks for the introduction, Kartik.
02:09:05.256 - 02:09:38.788, Speaker A: I'll just share my screen now. Hi, everyone. So I'm just going to quickly present for the next 15 minutes what even is a roll up. And what I want to highlight before I begin is that I'm not affiliated with any roll up project. So I'm going to try my best to give you an on bias view of the problems that they're trying to solve. I currently work for Infura and I also advise Lemdacap. So without further ado, as everyone's aware, this wonderful event is going to be about blockchain scalability for the next month.
02:09:38.788 - 02:10:33.928, Speaker A: And over the past year, a bunch of new projects have emerged, like Arbitrum Aztec Sellers, UK sync optimism, polygon, starkware ZK Swap and Loop ring. And these are projects that are called roll ups, that are promising low fees, smart contract deployment, transfers, and a much better user experience than developing on Ethereum. So what I really want to highlight is, why does this matter? What are the problems they're trying to solve? And hopefully set you up for the next three weeks so you can get a really good understanding what's going on. But before I get into that, I always like to ask people this question. Have you ever deposited coins into an Exchange or an online service like Coinbase Finance or Bitstum? Nobody asks people to raise their hand, but there's no hands here to be raised. But pretty much, if you've ever used an Exchange before, then you've actually used a layer two system. You've had to deposit coins under the service.
02:10:33.928 - 02:11:21.936, Speaker A: You get a balance that becomes positive on the website. You can then trade, you can execute transactions, whatever. And the idea there is that these intermediary services, Coinbase, Bitstop, Finance, et cetera, they're technically layer two sequencers. They take all of their users transactions, they order them, they execute them, then they update their layer two database, which basically determines how much funds you have on the service. Now, the problem with these layer two services is one, they're fully custodial, they can freeze confiscate, or they could even just lose your funds. Two, they're not auditable that layer two database that they have. Can anyone here access the coinbase database? Well, obviously not, because it's opaque and it's not publicly auditable.
02:11:21.936 - 02:11:53.372, Speaker A: So the question then is, are these layer two services, are they running a fractional reserve? And we don't know. Who knows? We can't actually look at the database. And as I mentioned, they also control the ordering of transactions. So given a list of transactions, they can order them and determine how they're executed. So layer two is used every day, but it is custodial and is high risk. Back in 2016, Goon had this wonderful tweet that 33% of bitcoin exchanges have been hacked. And then as they get hacked, they tend to be large scales.
02:11:53.372 - 02:12:41.564, Speaker A: Mount Gox has lost 850,000 bitcoin, Bitfinix lost 120,000 bitcoin. And it's not because they're not being malicious or adversarial. It's just very difficult to keep custody of a large, big honey pot of funds that a hacker can just get in, steal the private key and then run away with all your funds. So the question is, with all of these roll offs and all these cool layer two protocols, can we transact on a layer two system while still allowing users to maintain full self custody of their own funds? So, let's find out. What I'm going to explore today is I want people to get a better understanding of rollops and more generically, as Polygon said, commit chains. Because rollops are just a single instance within this entire design space. We're going to look at this from first principles.
02:12:41.564 - 02:13:38.988, Speaker A: So what is a commit chain and how does it work? What is the wider environment they live in? And what are the protocol assumptions? Who is the adversary? What is their power and how are they trying to break the system and steal your funds? And finally, what are the security goals that need to be satisfied before a roll up is secure? And hopefully this will set you up for the rest of the hackathon. So the big difference with these commit chains is that you still have this sequencer that can be one sequencer or multiple sequencers. They're still collecting layer two transactions, they're still ordering the transactions. But the big difference is that they have to post little checkpoints to Ethereum periodically. These checkpoints will define the order of transactions and also the execution of all those transactions. So what is the current state of the layer two database? And there's like this little checkpoint that send to Ethereum. And so this big difference allows for layer one enforcement.
02:13:38.988 - 02:14:09.116, Speaker A: So it's up to the layer one to enforce that all these transactions are valid and correct. Then Alice comes along and Alice wants to use the layer two system. So Alice will still have to deposit one coin into this layer two system. But the big difference here is that this coin is deposited into a layer one smart contract and it's never given to the sequencer. So the sequencer never. Has custody of your funds. And typically you still have to do a signature in order to transfer funds in the layer two system.
02:14:09.116 - 02:14:34.208, Speaker A: So this layer one contract that enforces the roll up rules also has custody of your funds. Then Bob comes along. Hi, Bob. And Alice wants to sign a coin to Bob. So Alice will sign a transaction, give it to the sequencer, then the sequencer can ping Bob and say, bob, you've now got one transaction, one coin. But this isn't final yet. This is still pending until the sequencer posts a checkpoint to Ethereum.
02:14:34.208 - 02:15:29.968, Speaker A: So we wait around, there's no new transactions, checkpoint gets posted, then everyone can see that Alice's transfer is confirmed and Bob has received the one coin. And over time, checkpoints get posted and that finalizes the transactions. Now, the final difference, which really makes rollops and commit chains beautiful, is that Alice should be able to use Ethereum, this layer one blockchain to get the ground truth data about the layer two system. It should also be able to fetch the entire transaction history for the layer two system and recompute the entire layer two database herself. And then she can verify that everything is valid and everything is correct. But what does it mean to be secure for a commit chain? Well, Georgia has this wonderful Twitter thread that says what makes layer two special is that layer two security equal equal layer one security. But I'm going to argue that's too ambiguous.
02:15:29.968 - 02:16:12.732, Speaker A: Layer two protocols really cannot have the same security as layer one. But they can get pretty damn close and it's really this pretty damn close is where the detail and the really cool innovation that's happening. So what does it mean to be secure? So now I'm going to cover the protocol assumptions and the threat model. What do we assume to be true? Who is our adversary and what special powers do they have? Then I'm going to talk about the security goals and what we're trying to actually keep secure. So the adversarial model, I'm going to break it down to two parts. First, the advertory has control over the message control flow. So any message is sent on the layer two system, the advertory can view, order and drop.
02:16:12.732 - 02:16:58.304, Speaker A: So they can censor all the transactions in layer two if they want, and they can reorder them. The only thing they can't do, and this is a protocol assumption, is Alice can always reliably send a transaction to the layer one blockchain, which is Ethereum, and as long as he pays an appropriate fee, it will always get mined. And this also assumes Alice can always see the layer one, Ethereum, can always see the contents of that, and the layer two system can't stop her from looking at it. The second part of the Edvacera model is that there's only two trusted parties. There's Alice, who's honest, the single user and the smart contract, Ethereum. We assume both of those parties are honest. Otherwise the adversary can corrupt everyone.
02:16:58.304 - 02:17:52.772, Speaker A: They can corrupt every sequencer and they can corrupt all users. So really, if I'm using this layer two system, I have to assume everyone can be corrupted and I still have to be safe and secure within that environment. So really, we've described the most powerful adversary possible. And really, not every rule app has the tools to fully constrain or outright defeat this beast. But another way to look at it is that it's a tag team battle between the honest user, this layer one smart contract, and they're fighting the sequence during the adversary to constrain it and make it bend to their will. And if you don't have this epic fight in your hands for a layer two protocol, then it's not really a layer two protocol and unfortunately, I'm not too interested in that. So what are the security goals? What are the security properties? What are we trying to keep secure? How are we trying to constrain this adversary? The first one is the data availability problem.
02:17:52.772 - 02:18:36.428, Speaker A: So what do I mean by this? So, as I mentioned, the sequencer has to post little checkpoints to Ethereum. It's typically a 32 byte hash which will include the layer two state and a list of transactions that are being executed. So how do we guarantee that the entire transaction history for the layer two ledger is publicly available? So this is important for several reasons. One, audibility Alice wants to recompute the layer two database herself. She needs the transactions to recompute it herself. Two, interaction. If she's going to send a swap on uniswap on this layer two system, she wants to verify that the exchange rate she's being quoted is correct according to the layer two database.
02:18:36.428 - 02:19:05.396, Speaker A: And finally, withdrawal. If Alice wants to withdraw her coins from the system, she may have to inform the layer one blockchain what her final balance is that she's going to withdraw. And bingo. This is where we get roll ups. This is the only thing that roll ups solve in terms of all these problems. A roll up literally means all transaction data is rolled up and posted to the layer one blockchain. This is actually a slightly stronger assumption.
02:19:05.396 - 02:19:55.544, Speaker A: We now assume the layer one blockchain has plenty of storage, it can store all the transaction data, bandwidth is not an issue, and everything can be stored on Ethereum. But this is one of four ways to solve that problem. But that is what a roll up is, the state transition integrity problem. Now, so the issue here is, how do we guarantee that the final execution of a layer two transaction is correct? Because a sequencer could post a checkpoint which has the state and an invalid transaction that steals everyone's coins. And if the sequencer can get away with this, then obviously they can just steal all the funds in the layer two system and it's not secure. So there's another bingo card this is optimistic versus zero knowledge, fraud proof versus validity proofs. I'm not going to go into it now, but you'll hear plenty of debates over the next few weeks about the pros and cons of either approach.
02:19:55.544 - 02:20:15.900, Speaker A: But again, that's the only problem. Fraud proofs and validity proofs are solving state transition integrity. And the final problem is withdrawal integrity. So let's just say Alice wants to withdraw her coins from the system. She says, Sequencer, here's my withdrawal transaction. Give me my ten die. And the sequencer says, no, you're stuck forever.
02:20:15.900 - 02:20:56.508, Speaker A: You're never getting your coins out. They're confiscated. The system should be set up so Alice can always withdraw her coins even if this sequencer is offline or does not cooperate. So now we have our three problems data availability, state transition integrity, and withdrawal integrity. If we can satisfy the above problems, then hopefully we can slay the beast, deploy a secure layer two system, and everyone can have all their unicorns. But even if we can satisfy all three properties, do we still need the trusted sequencer? So the answer is yes, no, yes, no, yes, no one. It depends how well people can satisfy those three problems.
02:20:56.508 - 02:21:22.196, Speaker A: And there's no perfect solution out there. But there's also other problems that pop up that relate to security. The first is minor extractable value. And you're going to hear a lot about this over the next three weeks. But the idea is that the Sequencer can control the order of all transactions. So if I send in a trade on uniswap and I allow for $1,000 worth of slip each, the sequencer can sandwich me. They front run me, they back run me.
02:21:22.196 - 02:22:05.296, Speaker A: The victim transaction goes in the middle and they interfere with your computation and they extract $1,000 from your trade. They haven't tampered with your transaction, they've just played with the state so they could take the slippage. Is this an outright attack on an outright attack on the system? Or is it a potential business model? Is it the Robin Hood of roll ups? There's still a debate out there, but what we do know is mev is very profitable. You can go look the Flashbots project. And they're making way more money than honest miners who just take the transaction fee. I think over 60% of miners now are now using Flashbots. But most importantly, we need to trust Sequencers because this is the difference between the fast path and the slow path.
02:22:05.296 - 02:22:23.800, Speaker A: And I mean the very slow path. If Sequencers are honest, I give my transaction to the sequencer. They'll acknowledge me right away to say, patty, your transaction will be mine. This is the final execution and it will be finalized within the next two 3 hours. I walk away. I'm happy it gets finalized. And the sequencer did what they promised.
02:22:23.800 - 02:23:28.880, Speaker A: If the Sequencer cannot be trusted, maybe I give them my transaction. They want to do some mev or whatever and I have no guarantee what the final execution is going to be, then actually I may end up on the very slow path because one, I'm waiting for 4 hours or 2 hours to know what the final execution really was. But also I may just have to send the transaction to Ethereum directly. If I want it to be truly executed the way I want it to be definitely 100% included in the blockchain, then that's actually the very slow path and that's even worse than Ethereum today. So we still have to care who these sequencers are going to be and what keeps them honest. So what we need to consider is that first, how are sequencers selected? Is it centralized? Are they appointed? Are they elected? Do they have stake on the system? And also the consensus protocol. How do these sequencers reach agreement on the next set of transactions to be executed? Do they take an intern to Alice Bob, Carlin, Alice Bob, Carly? Or do they have some BPFT protocol there? So, this is my final slide.
02:23:28.880 - 02:24:11.304, Speaker A: I obviously haven't given many solutions in these slides, but what I hope that I've given you is a much better understanding about the problems that surround roll ups and throughout the hackathon. You can now poke your favorite project and say how do you solve the data availability problem? How are you solving the State Integrity problem? Do you deal with mev? Do you have order, fairness, et cetera, et cetera? So I'm going to finish with this slide. This is what a layer two protocol is about. And if you don't have this battle on your hands, then it's not a layer two protocol. So thank you for listening. Thank you so much, Patty. This was super helpful as a context.
02:24:11.304 - 02:24:40.500, Speaker A: And we also have a few questions coming in already. So what we'll do is send you the list and we'll bring you on at the end of the next two talks for the panel and you can ask those questions and answer those questions there. So all that said, I am super excited to intro our next talk and that is Carl. Carl's going to be talking about the optimistic virtual machine, the OVM. And Carl's from Optimism. And without further ado, I'll let Carl kick off with his talk. Hey, Carl.
02:24:40.500 - 02:25:15.890, Speaker A: Why hello. How's it going y'all? Very exciting. This has been looking forward to the scaling Ethereum hackathon, the best topic for a hackathon possible for a while. So hello. Hello. I am Carl. I'm going to talk to you about just optimistic Ethereum, a quick overview and the future and a scalability deep dive, aka what do we really mean by scalability? So let's get started.
02:25:15.890 - 02:25:35.112, Speaker A: Let me actually turn on a clock. There we go. So let's dive in. If this is what you think scalability is, this is incorrect. If this is what you think scalability is, this is incorrect. Scalability. The transaction fees are way too high.
02:25:35.112 - 02:25:53.500, Speaker A: Thankfully. I have been talking about this for a long time and people seem to get the picture now, so that's really nice. 15 seconds. 15 minutes. These are all way too slow. We need super quick, super quick transactions with low fees. It is unacceptable.
02:25:53.500 - 02:26:36.416, Speaker A: But let me go back a little bit, a little big time travel, and talk about who I am. What's optimism PBC and how did we really get here? So I actually started out working at Consensus for a little bit. Then I kind of traveled around the world with Vitalik and talked on some stairs and ranted like I'm doing now. And then had a little introduction to cryptocurrencies and worked on this crypto economics book with Jing and Kevin and told my friend, oh, you should really get into crypto. And they got really depressed because he was my last friend who wasn't into crypto. And then my friends got me out of that depression. Thank goodness.
02:26:36.416 - 02:27:10.932, Speaker A: We formed Plasma Group with Kelvin and we were like, oh, can plasma scale Uniswap? No, it cannot. And so we worked on this thing called optimistic roll up and we created Unipig and we created this new thing called optimism. And Synthetics was like, oh, Unipig was pretty cool. Let me take a then, you know, Mark joined and Krista joined and Josh joined and Annie and Liam and Gigamesh, and it's a big, happy, explosive family. So that is amazing. And the optimistic ethereum family is growing bigger and bigger. And this talk is going to be all about community.
02:27:10.932 - 02:27:43.680, Speaker A: It's going to be all about ethereum. But before we get into all that, let's go into a little bit of technical stuff. Little bit of technical right here. And then we got after the technical stuff, we got some design principles which is less technical, and then we'll go into the rest. So what is optimistic ethereum? It's a minimal addition to ethereum that enables an EVM based layer to roll up. But what does that really mean? Basically, it's just ethereum inside of ethereum. So very technical work coming in.
02:27:43.680 - 02:28:03.988, Speaker A: We got ethereum. It's the l one right? That's the base layer. And then we got optimistic ethereum, which is L two, and it's in ethereum. Wow. Very crazy. It's a little recursive. And before you ask, yes, in fact, you can do L three and put optimistic ethereum inside optimistic ethereum.
02:28:03.988 - 02:28:46.884, Speaker A: But let's dive in. Okay, so how does this work? Okay, first, y'all can take a look at a bunch of presentations know Ben and Kelvin did yesterday. And we've got a bunch of presentations on this, so I'm not going to actually take too much time, but optimistic rope is the optimistic ethereum is a combination of optimistic Rope and the OVM, and optimistic rope gives us security and the OVM gives us EVM expressibility. And so I'm going to give you a 1 minute presentation, one minutes, of course, for what exactly that means. All right? Three, two, one, go. Let's see how I do. Okay, optimistic roll up.
02:28:46.884 - 02:29:06.648, Speaker A: We've got the security portion. So Ethereum is processing all these transactions. It's a tired doge, it's doing too much work. And so then bumping on optimistic Ethereum comes in. Don't fear, let me help you do some transaction processing. And then it goes bad. And then the Verifiers prove fraud and then it goes well and Ethereum is happy and a happy doge success.
02:29:06.648 - 02:29:21.420, Speaker A: Okay? So that's how optimistic rollup works. Vin eyes. And this is how the OVM works. So normally you have smart contracts, they talk to each other. But we need to put EVM inside of EVM. We need to put Ethereum inside of Ethereum. That means we need container virtualization boom.
02:29:21.420 - 02:29:43.572, Speaker A: So we take the OVM. The OVM. Is this container virtualized EVM? We can run it inside of the EVM. So now we're diverting calls to the container contract, this virtualizer contract and all of the stateful operations, they go through that. That's how we maintain a sandbox and that's how this thing works. It's kind of similar to the diamond pattern and stateless execution. Bam.
02:29:43.572 - 02:30:15.920, Speaker A: That was actually 1 minute. I did just record it. So very good. So optimistic roll up, right? For the fraud proofs OVM is for the container virtualization it's to give us EVM inside of an EVM. That's optimistic ethereum. But what is optimistic Ethereum really like? What is the essence of this project? Because technology is only one aspect of the puzzle. So the optimistic Ethereum design principles, two of them that I'm going to talk about today are incrementalism and minimalism.
02:30:15.920 - 02:31:20.832, Speaker A: So incrementalism it's really fun to say things like oh, we've solved scalability. Oh, there's this big breakthrough. Wow. And the world explodes, right? I said those things in fact many times and it's fun to an extent. But in reality progress looks a lot more like this, right? We're like slowly carrying building up the kind of global intelligence of the human species, right? And it's been getting built for a long time. So we're little tiny cogs in that greater machine and that is really what things are like. And so there's a real scalability solution in Ethereum that doesn't get talked about nearly enough and that is geth that's open Ethereum, that's turbogeth that's these incredible researchers that's these people that for instance, in the past few years we've increased the scalability of Ethereum over two X, right? The scalability is not something that just kind of comes out of the blue.
02:31:20.832 - 02:32:25.820, Speaker A: It is based on a huge amount of work from a lot, a lot of different people including research that is being implemented as EIPS like changing the gas prices of various Opcodes or introducing access lists or the most cutting edge research like things like vertical tries for stateless clients. This is the stuff that really gets us scale and tooling, right? We've got a ton of incredible tooling in the Ethereum ecosystem. Tons of folks working on it and that is required. If you're trying to build a production piece of software, you need production level tooling. And so all of this stuff is built on open source software and public goods. And it's so exciting to be able to work and build technology that utilizes all of this different tooling. And so that is what we're trying to do with optimistic Ethereum, right? We're trying to build on top of that software and kind of fit in like a puzzle piece.
02:32:25.820 - 02:33:02.452, Speaker A: That means that we must support the OVM, I mean the EVM. That means that we can implement this incredible research that's being done and we can make use of the implementations of that research that are built for ETH One. It allows us and of course, open source everything that goes without saying. It's like we can be a test bed for ETH One point X. And so the other thing that I want to talk about is minimalism. So a wise sage named George once said that every line of code costs $100. So you better not write a lot of lines of code because it's expensive.
02:33:02.452 - 02:33:41.548, Speaker A: So really what this process is, it's really just this surgical precision that you need to have when you're, for instance, upgrading, geth to be optimistic, geth right. You need to minimize your diff. You need to minimize the lines changed. And the reason why is because we're standing on the shoulders of giants. This is a kind of weird photo, but it's standing on the shoulders of giants. And so that goes for the protocol itself. We can't diverge from Ethereum too far because the further we diverge, the less we can kind of make use of this incredible ecosystem, right? We're trying to maximize our leverage, maximize our impact.
02:33:41.548 - 02:34:08.892, Speaker A: And to do that, we need to make use of all of the technology that has been built before and also all of the tooling that's been built before. We have to fit in like a puzzle piece and be that test bed for e .1 point x that I talked about. So those are some of the main design principles. The other one is got to be love, got to give love, got to be nice to each other. So anyway, that's that okay. So next we got the path forward.
02:34:08.892 - 02:34:33.872, Speaker A: This is a kind of overview of where we're headed. And then we're going to, after that, talk about this whole kind of deep dive into scalability. It's a little more technical then, but before we get into the technical stuff, let's stay at a high level. So we're currently on pseudo main net. We've saved folks over $10 million. It's pretty cool, pretty sweet. And we came up with a few names for these releases.
02:34:33.872 - 02:35:01.948, Speaker A: I'm going to talk about a bunch of releases and these are subject to change. But the first release is Inconspicuous medium sized animal. This is the mascot for this incredible release. And we need to go to full main net next. And the thing that will take us there is improving our upgradability infrastructure. So I was actually planning on talking about that in this talk, but I ran out of time. So the upgradability is a future talk coming up.
02:35:01.948 - 02:35:36.536, Speaker A: There's just too much to talk about on this other stuff. So anyway, the code name Chalk Marker, this is our first, our full main net. And so the reason why is because we write on Windows with chalk markers. Chalk markers are great, you should buy them, they're great to write on Windows. So our full four releases categories that I have here are chalk Marker, then Irritated Window Cleaner and then poor airbnb rating. And finally, the final finale ultimate release is iPhone Four. So for each one of these releases there's various things and we'll go over each one.
02:35:36.536 - 02:36:15.860, Speaker A: So first Chalk Marker, we've got instant upgrades, we've got arbitrary contract deployment. So arbitrary contract deployment, that's good. But we've got no slashing and we've got a single sequencer with OVM self upgrades. So what does this really mean? It means that we've got these guardrails right, we're definitely not at the decentralized end goal that we want to be in where we know that there are things that are fundamentally broken about how the protocol works. This would not be sustainable long term, but it gives us the flexibility to actually iterate on and try out the software that we are building. No eggs were harmed. The next step, we're getting better.
02:36:15.860 - 02:36:55.644, Speaker A: We're closer to the decentralized utopia with delayed upgrades. So instead of being able to instantly upgrade the contracts, they're delayed. And we've got slashing and we've got a single sequencer and we've got some simple compression for data availability optimizations. And so we're getting there, but we're still a single sequencer, we're still running it and that we definitely do not want to be doing that soon, as soon as humanly possible. Then the next one is poor airbnb rating. So now we're really decentralized. We got super delayed upgrades, multi sequencer, we're starting to mess around with speculative execution for scalability purposes.
02:36:55.644 - 02:37:34.460, Speaker A: We've got pluggable compression and some fun stuff with gas limit rating using an EIP 1559 curve. Anyway, all of this stuff. But there's one fundamental thing that we're missing and that is ETH two. And so finally the kind of nirvana iPhone Four is we've got E two shard Blob transaction feed. So in other words, we can use the E two shards for our data availability. That means that we can scale up to use all of the availability, all of the kind of availability that is provided by you two. And we're actually going to talk about what that really means very soon.
02:37:34.460 - 02:38:09.840, Speaker A: And we've got some other fun stuff like optim upgrade support that allows you to kind of fork the chain arbitrarily and concealed transactions and Zkevm, all these fun things. So this is the kind of high level progression, right? Starting out centralized more flexible. We have to have upgrades throughout this entire process. And then we get more and more decentralized one thing at a time until we are fully integrated into ethereum and decentralized. So that is the path forward. Okay, so we did design principles. We got the roadmap.
02:38:09.840 - 02:38:11.650, Speaker A: Now we're going to go back into some.
