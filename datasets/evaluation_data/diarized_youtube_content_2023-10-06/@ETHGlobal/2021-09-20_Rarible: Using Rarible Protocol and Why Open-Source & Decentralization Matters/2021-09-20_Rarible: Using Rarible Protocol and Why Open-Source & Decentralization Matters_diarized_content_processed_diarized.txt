00:00:08.430 - 00:00:09.300, Speaker A: Hi, everyone.
00:00:09.910 - 00:00:22.050, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. Thank you to Alex. Really looking forward to this presentation. I'm going to give it one more minute. Let everybody get in here before we kick off. I appreciate everyone's patience.
00:00:23.110 - 00:00:52.580, Speaker A: Excited to see all of you guys here today. I see a couple of funny pictures with cats, new people joining.
00:01:02.560 - 00:01:22.780, Speaker B: Keep this as close to the schedule as possible, as I mentioned. Thank you to everyone joining us today on this fine Monday morning. This is our first ETH online workshop of the week. Really looking forward to what Alex has here in store for us today. Alex, thank you for joining us. Obviously, really looking forward to what you have to present. I will let you take it from here.
00:01:22.780 - 00:01:44.200, Speaker B: We will be taking questions at the end, so if you want to funnel your questions into the chat, we can get to them. I will be moderating, but Alex will be able to pull them out of the chat at any time at the end. We'll do a little bit of A-Q-A if you can't, or if he isn't able to answer your question at the end, you're more than welcome to take a conversation to the discord and follow up there. Alex, floor is all yours.
00:01:44.540 - 00:02:11.180, Speaker A: Thank you, Luke. Thank you for having me today. Excited to see everybody here. Looking forward to tell you something probably new about the protocol. And I wanted to start by just quickly introducing myself. A lot of you guys might have heard about Wearable, but my name is Alex, Alex Solnikov. I'm co founder and head of product at Wearable.
00:02:11.180 - 00:02:46.940, Speaker A: And today I wanted to tell you about the protocol and about why we've made it decentralized and open and open source. Well, probably a lot of you understand the motto behind open and decentralized systems, but I wanted to emphasize that once again. So Wearable Protocol, let me share the screen real quick. At first, Wearable Wearable started almost two years ago now. We went live on November 2019.
00:02:48.960 - 00:02:49.276, Speaker B: With.
00:02:49.298 - 00:03:31.416, Speaker A: The Issuance platform and marketplace. So we went with, like, why don't you guys create your own NFTs and try to sell them, and we will build tools for that. And that quickly escalated into the full featured marketplace that you can now see on the Wearable.com website. We do a million dollars of daily GMV, more or less, and it's been an exciting journey. About a year ago, we launched a governance token, rari and liquidity mining program that allowed everyone who uses the marketplace to basically capitalize on that and to earn governance. Right.
00:03:31.416 - 00:04:42.464, Speaker A: We were distributing 75,000 tokens each week to the buyers and sellers of the marketplace, and it worked incredibly well. We are number two marketplace across the Ethereum Ecosystem, and I'm proud to present the work of our last six months is the Wearable Protocol. Basically, what we did, we took the infrastructural part behind Wearable.com marketplace and created a separate product out of it for you, for developers, for builders, for other people who wanted to create a marketplace. Because building marketplace for two years, we understood that there is a lot of work to be done to actually create a great experience for the users. That's why we tried to simplify this for you and came up with the Wearable Protocol. So what Wearable Protocol is, is this set of tools that are there to enable the easiest go to market strategy for the new NFT project.
00:04:42.464 - 00:05:20.760, Speaker A: We have a ton of projects already building on Protocol. Wearable.com is one of the projects actually that is working on top of the protocol. So it's literally a peer to everyone else who is building on top of Protocol too. We have Mintgate Coco NFT, beautiful apps that work on the top of the Protocol xeroon using the protocol in their NFT integration. On Cyber is the platform for displaying your NFTs also users to Protocol. So in the ballpark, Wearable Protocol is the multi chain, cross chain, open source, decentralized exchange.
00:05:20.760 - 00:06:26.336, Speaker A: So it's a set of smart contract and an indexer on top of those smart contracts to make you trade, just peer to peer trade, swap NFTs to Ethereum and ERC, 20 assets and vice versa. So any pair of 721, 1155, ERC, 721, ERC, 1155, ERC, 20 is supported to trade through the protocol. Basically, protocol works as an order book exchange where the orders are stored off chain to make you put things on sale for free so you don't need to pay gas prices, which are absolutely insane these days for most. Of The People Who Trade NFTs that Are Not CryptoPunk, that Don't Cost 50 E. So For Every Lower Segment average NFT, like an Average Check Size Is $1,000 in The NFT. So paying $100 for a gas price for each interaction with a contract is a lot. So that's why we're using off chain order book.
00:06:26.336 - 00:07:10.684, Speaker A: Basically, if you want to put something on sale, you need only to sign a signature to sign an order, which is just the structure, JSON structure that is stored off chain. Now, when you want to actually execute these orders, so you have a buy order and a sell order, you're going to the on chain smart contract. You put these two signed orders in it and the assets are swapped. This is done trustlessly. No one is in charge of funds. The smart contract verifies both orders and swaps the assets. So this is the ballpark of what Protocol is the smart contract for issuance.
00:07:10.684 - 00:07:46.216, Speaker A: So we provide you the standard smart contract. You can also derive smart contract from Wearable collection to have your own collection. And the best part about this minting contracts is that wearable protocol supports Lazy Minting. So you can mint NFTs for free without gas price. You derive the gas price to the buyer when the buyer buys an item. And in terms of the protocol. In words of the protocol, that happens when two orders are matched on chain.
00:07:46.216 - 00:08:26.840, Speaker A: The item is created only then, so it's like a derived Minting and the gas price is paid by the person who executes these orders. We support ethereum. Also we support polygon testnet. And the polygon main net is the latest stages of development. We're literally deploying this behind the scenes this week. And the flow is in the development. Under active development support of the flow blockchain, you won't be able to access the flow blockchain on this hackathon, unfortunately.
00:08:26.840 - 00:09:11.828, Speaker A: And Union Service, the thing that would combine all of these blockchains together, so they work not as separate like indexers, but as one indexer is also in the development. So if you want to build a cross chain marketplace, that's also really great for you. Some features, yes, again, I've counted the main ones. It's lazy minting. Minting? Contract and exchange contract. The best part about Exchange Contract is the flexible fee structure. So when you create an order and submit that to the protocol, you can actually set up your own front end fee.
00:09:11.828 - 00:09:44.780, Speaker A: So whenever you build something on top of the protocol, your application is instantly monetizable. So you attach your own fees. The protocol fees are zero. As for now, the question about the protocol fees is the open governance question. So it probably will be solved down the road. For now, it's zero. We expect fees to be like a uniswap level, a financial level, asset fees.
00:09:44.780 - 00:10:29.548, Speaker A: So zero point, something that leaves you plenty of room to monetize. For example, the Wearable.com as an application takes 5% fees and other competitors in the space take up to 20% in fees. This is about the exchange. So again, monetizable apps on top of the protocol is a very much requested feature. We've built that in. Also, protocol supports split royalties, split payments, collaborations, multiple creators.
00:10:29.548 - 00:11:21.200, Speaker A: It's basically all sorts of splits everywhere, completely like customizable way of splitting payments. So any just use cases that wants to include multi creator, multi user, multi buyer, everything like that is supported. You can check. Let me check if I forgot something. Yeah, we support all sorts of royalties too. So there is an external royalty registry in which every collection holder, every collection owner can register their own fees for the collection, their own royalties for the collection. So that makes the protocol a perfect place for the secondary market.
00:11:21.200 - 00:12:28.070, Speaker A: And I wanted to tell a little bit more about secondary market. So right now, Wearable Protocol allows you to query orders both from Wearable and OpenSea. So you can literally build a front end marketplace that would have all the supply available on both marketplaces for your front end. You won't be able to take fees for the OpenSea orders, but you might add them to the Wearable orders. So just building an open marketplace, it just literally makes you if you want to build, for example, the tool that trades top ten collections, ten K collections that are active today on the big main page. You can do that on top of the protocol easily because it allows you to get all the supply and just add your own fees on top. And voila, we're good to go.
00:12:28.070 - 00:13:07.196, Speaker A: Yeah, I said polygon moonbeam flow are in the works. As for the layer two solutions, we're actively looking there. Protocol is under active development. That's one of the important parts. And I'm saying that it's not like breaking, we make all the changes backward compatible. But I'm saying that there are constantly new features added and there is very active discord. If you go to the discord we can write like feature requests, things like that and this will be added tailored to you specifically.
00:13:07.196 - 00:13:46.796, Speaker A: It's not something that is already done in sealed and you take it or leave it. No, it's under active development. If you need anything, we are happy to add this for you. I counted the life use cases already and this is all great. Oh yeah, almost forgot this. So the app mining program is live. Basically, if you build an app on top of the protocol and your app generates volume on the protocol, you are entitled to the portion of the weekly rare rewards.
00:13:46.796 - 00:14:32.510, Speaker A: Basically you earn ownership in the contract. By executing on the contract you can check the more detailed information on our discord and there are a couple of links I believe. So yeah, if you bring liquidity to the protocol, you earn an ownership over that. So start building today and I will just double down on this. You can check the documentation and our GitHub. So documentation leads you to the docs wearable.com. There is this simple protocol flow explanation of how it is actually built, just top level.
00:14:32.510 - 00:15:07.576, Speaker A: And there are some tutorials. So these tutorials and starter app are very important links for you. It will be super helpful. It's done by our community. So again, I think this is actually the starter app is one of the best things you can find. Again, you can find it by clicking documentation and Starter app on the left side. What else? Yeah, from the latest hackathons that we already done, there is an addition in the space.
00:15:07.576 - 00:15:56.008, Speaker A: It's the SDK that allows you to much more easily create orders, create items, lazy minted items, fill orders, all things like that. So you can click this button in the right top corner that takes you on the GitHub. And on the GitHub there is protocol contracts, protocol indexer and Protocol SDK. There's three repositories available for you. Repositories available for you. So Protocol Ethereum SDK has examples and some documentation about how it actually works. This is fine.
00:15:56.008 - 00:16:42.840, Speaker A: There is also somewhere there was the custom, I can find it right now. I'll send you all the links afterwards. Yeah, basically the there is this special repo for all the issues and the demo app yeah, I think this is the one. There was a demo app with the SDK. Oh, yeah, here it is. It's a protocol example. You can find that in tutorials.
00:16:42.840 - 00:17:40.260, Speaker A: In tutorials protocol example link. Yeah, it's done by our CTO, basically using SDK, configure SDK, create lazy mint item, sell orders, buy order and get NFTs from your current wallet. Yes, I almost overlooked and I wanted to come back really quick on the indexer part. So the indexer when you're building a DAP on the Ethereum, there are basically like two ways to do that. The first one is directly interacting with the smart contract. You have smart contract and that's only it. You don't have any server, you don't have any backend, you just want to interact directly with the smart contract.
00:17:40.260 - 00:18:39.080, Speaker A: So when you're dealing with NFTs, it's actually almost impossible to interact directly with smart contracts because you need an index, you need an understanding of which NFTs belong to whom. Which NFTs do you want to create orders for which NFTs do you want to list, which NFTs do you want to query? That's why there is this indexer that listens to blockchain, to ethereum blockchain and keeps track of everything. Every NFT you can query like all my NFTs by address, by collection, by owner, by creator, all things like that. It's done by the indexer. Wearable indexer is the first completely open sourced indexer in the NFT space. So out of the alternatives there is the graph. But the graph can't work with all the, ERC, 721 contracts.
00:18:39.080 - 00:19:29.128, Speaker A: So the graph is probably good only when you are dealing with only one collection. So again, if you want to work with a lot of NFTs, you need an indexer. And indexer also stores orders. So it's an essential part of the wearable contract. So I also skipped one link that you will obviously need. So in this documentation for the wearable contract, you can scroll a little bit down and find this API reference. So API reference is the open API for the protocol.
00:19:29.128 - 00:20:29.392, Speaker A: It contains all of the API calls that you could possibly have wanted to do under this section and you can explore this and call them. So the place where you want to start is NFT order, item, controller. Sorry for the names, it's going to be rewired in a while. But basically this name means a controller that this controller is aware about NFTs and about orders. So basically this call from this controller would give you NFT itself and the best order and the metadata. I have a call created somewhere here. So yeah, basically let's take an example.
00:20:29.392 - 00:21:15.230, Speaker A: I want to get NFT order by item. It's basically like getting an item. So as you can see, this is the URL to call it and in the response it will return me the token, ID, contracts, unlockable and all the things, royalties, owners, basically all the things that we know about an item. So I've assembled a small call here. I added just so it's ethereumapi wearable.org v 0.1 Nftorderitems and here goes the item ID.
00:21:15.230 - 00:21:54.190, Speaker A: And then there is an optional parameter, include metadata and it returns the item. With metadata we can see ID, contract token, ID unlockable creators creators might be multiple. That's why there is an array supply, lazy supply, lazy supply zero. So that's not a lazy item. Owners, owners. If that's 1155, you'll see multiple owners here, multiple royalties. Again, we have a 10% to somebody date.
00:21:54.190 - 00:23:21.910, Speaker A: We have the metadata, name, description, attributes, all is here, image, image, meta and we also have the order, the best order, best bid order and best we don't have best sell order here. So best bid order basically represents the best bid for this item. We are almost out of the time, so I'll stop here and let's open up the floor for questions. Tron so far, but it's EVM compatible, so it can be deployed by just manually deploying contracts and indexer. Setting all that up, you can create a support for Throne for the protocol. The question from Ctzens is it open source indexer API as the tools for query the smart contract. I mean to get creation of the original NFTs.
00:23:21.910 - 00:24:35.878, Speaker A: So you want to use indexer to query all the things that happened in the blockchain. If you want something to execute something in the blockchain, you need to call the smart contract directly. So imagine I want to mint an item. I'm minting an item in the contract and it gets picked up by the indexer. But if I want to create a lazy minted item, I need to direct that to the indexer first because that's how lazy minted items are created. Hey Alex, what are the thoughts in the NFT marketplace space? Specifically competitors like OpenSea Super Rare Foundation? This call is meant to be more technical, so I don't think this is the right place to discuss this competitiveness. I would say that technically just Super Rare Foundation are on chain completely, right? So they use auctions that are on chain.
00:24:35.878 - 00:25:15.480, Speaker A: You interact with the contract directly. OpenSea uses off chain order book, wearable protocol uses off chain order book. And as I said already, you can query the Openc and Wearable and Open Sea orders from the indexer. So you can actually basically have the liquidity of both by using the protocol. And I think that was all the questions. So if we have more, let's bring them in.
00:25:17.850 - 00:26:01.110, Speaker B: Don't miss your opportunity to ask Alex what you're thinking. But if there are no more questions and you can save them, feel free to reach out in discord where the whole team will be present and able to answer your questions throughout the hack. And I want to thank everyone for joining us, but we'll give it one more minute. Ask away. Awesome. Well, if there are no more final questions, I want to thank everyone for joining us. I want to thank Alex for being here on Monday morning or Monday afternoon, depending on where you are today.
00:26:01.110 - 00:26:10.490, Speaker B: And I want to thank the whole team for making this happen. I'm really excited to see Variable here again, and I think we're on for a really good hackathon this time.
00:26:11.360 - 00:26:35.312, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone. Thank you guys for the questions. Thank you for listening me. Drop me a feedback on Discord. If you think that I might have expanded something better or that I didn't mention something or that something was unclear, I would be glad to hear something that I can make better. Thank you, Luke.
00:26:35.496 - 00:26:49.120, Speaker B: Excellent. We'll be closing the session right now. We have our team formation session coming up soon, so don't miss that. But we will be closing this zoom session now. I appreciate everyone again and look forward to seeing you later. Thanks, Alex.
