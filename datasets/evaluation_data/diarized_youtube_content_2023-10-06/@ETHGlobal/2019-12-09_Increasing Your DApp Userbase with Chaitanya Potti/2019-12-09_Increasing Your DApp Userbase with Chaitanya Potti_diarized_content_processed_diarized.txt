00:00:00.890 - 00:00:37.650, Speaker A: So what is taurus? So we provide frictionless login solutions for DApps. Right now, let's say if you want to use any other existing wallet in the market, right, it requires you to memorize some seed words or set up some recovery statements or it requires a lot of hassle, basically. Whereas with Taurus we guarantee a one click login for your DAP. You can already use your existing third party applications like Google, Facebook, Reddit, Twitch, or Discord to simply log into DApps. That's it. And the user onboarding is very smooth. And if you need more security, right, you can just use the built in security with all these login mechanisms.
00:00:37.650 - 00:01:44.150, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that's the easiest pitch we had so far. And I'm going to say a statement right now saying that taurus is the easiest integration during the entire hackathon and I'm going to back up my words as well. Okay, you can see that. Before we go to that, I'll just give a high level overview of how Torus works. When the user signs into the first time, we basically create a public private key pair and then we split the private key into five different shards. And then we basically give each one of these shards to one of the industry stakeholders, which we have a couple of other industry stakeholders which are present currently are Binance Labs version from Ethereum Foundation, ATC Incorporated and a couple of others Coinbase. And when you log in on the front end with your Google OAuth verifier, let's say we basically send the verification code to all of the taurus nodes which are present, and once they verify that it's actually who actually signed in, they just send back their share and all the shares are assembled on the front end.
00:01:44.150 - 00:01:56.878, Speaker A: And that's where the private key lives. Always. That's it. So apart from the front end, the private key is never fully available anywhere else in the entire Taurus network and it's only available after you log in and approve the request.
00:01:56.974 - 00:01:58.340, Speaker B: Okay, yeah.
00:01:59.910 - 00:02:20.620, Speaker A: So there are multiple ways of using for us. The first is through a script tag. You'll dump that in your body of your HTML and then it just works. The second thing is using an NPM package which you have, which provides you customizability, to be honest, and it'll help you just use your own build system. So you know the drill, right?
00:02:22.430 - 00:02:36.046, Speaker B: Let me just present what is that? Oh, yeah, works nicely. Yeah.
00:02:36.148 - 00:03:17.354, Speaker A: There are a couple more features in Taurus which we would actually be happy about if you guys integrate these. Okay, the first thing is the email to public key resolver, which is yeah, you can just see that, right? Taurus get public address, you pass in Verifier and a Verifier ID, which is like the unique ID for that particular type of Verifier. For Google it's your email, for Reddit, it's your username, whereas for Discord it's your ID of Discord. And we basically give you the public address. And one of the USPS of taurus is that you can actually get a public address assigned to you even before you actually register yourself on the taurus network. So I'll make a demo for that. It'll be really cool, guys.
00:03:17.354 - 00:03:20.158, Speaker A: And before that we can just move.
00:03:20.164 - 00:03:21.360, Speaker B: To the next slide here.
00:03:21.970 - 00:03:41.458, Speaker A: Yeah, we also have a lot of API price bounties over here. And these are the six bounties which we have for now. The grand prize is basically the best use case for reddit pitch and discord logins with taurus. That's Cad1500.
00:03:41.544 - 00:03:46.066, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, could you describe that a little bit more?
00:03:46.088 - 00:04:03.638, Speaker A: What do you mean by yeah, I'm going to explain it. Okay, so right now in case of taurus, right, the users can log in with Reddit, Discord or Twitch accounts. Okay, let's say you can build off the top of my head, you can build something like tip your twitch streamer using taurus.
00:04:03.814 - 00:04:04.154, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:04.192 - 00:04:40.698, Speaker A: That's something which you can build. So as I told you just a while ago, you have a public address resolver, right? So let's say your twitch streamer or the Reddit user or twitch streamer has an account already, okay. You can just get his public address using Torus. Get public address using just the username over there and then you get the public address and then you can just directly build a tipping bot for it. That's one of the use cases. We'll be glad to see more use cases coming up. I mean, you guys thinking of more? The other six bounties are best app that fully utilizes the torus's name dissolver.
00:04:40.734 - 00:04:41.846, Speaker B: Feature, which is one which I just.
00:04:41.868 - 00:05:15.666, Speaker A: Spoke about and other the one is which integrates taurus'hash time block contracts for distributing Airdrops. Let's say you guys win these bounties, right? The way we were sending it is we were just sending the money to your emails, whereas some of them submitted wrong emails for some reason. In such a scenario. What we want to do is allow you guys to use a HTLC contract to I think most of you know about hashemlock contracts, right? Where we send in some money in there and you actually claim it using.
00:05:15.688 - 00:05:17.138, Speaker B: Your account later on.
00:05:17.224 - 00:05:34.406, Speaker A: Okay, yeah. Best app that implements proof of signing for documents DocuSign with taurus. Yeah, that's pretty straightforward, I guess. Best app that integrates taurus with Aragona dow factories, very similar. And best app that indicates Torres does smart contract wallets like agnosis Safe or.
00:05:34.428 - 00:05:36.280, Speaker B: Something off the top of my head.
00:05:36.650 - 00:06:17.442, Speaker A: And best app and integrate layer two solutions. There are like shit ton of layer two solutions at the factcon itself. They also have a lot of boundaries and taurus is directly integratable with all of them. We have actually tested that and yeah, if there's a unique integration, surely we can bump that price out next. Yeah, if MetaMask is already installed with Torres, we have yeah, it would just work that's straightforward. And I'll show you the demo so that this is how the wallet looks. And yeah, there are some example DApps which is already integrated with one of them is Torres feedback events.
00:06:17.506 - 00:06:17.686, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:17.708 - 00:06:40.772, Speaker A: You can just look up how it looks and how it works as well, if necessary. And I think I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm going to the demo. So we also have GitHub repo where we listed out the hackathon prizes and also we put down all the links which are necessary.
00:06:40.836 - 00:06:43.176, Speaker B: Okay. The first thing is Docs Torrados for.
00:06:43.198 - 00:06:47.896, Speaker A: The documentation, the hackathon Discord Telegram, and feel free to reach out to us on any of these platforms and we'll.
00:06:47.928 - 00:06:51.884, Speaker B: Be quite responsive, I should say. Yeah.
00:06:52.002 - 00:06:56.610, Speaker A: And looking at the documentation. So before the documentation, I would just.
00:06:57.620 - 00:06:59.010, Speaker B: Show you guys a demo.
00:07:03.600 - 00:07:05.004, Speaker A: I'm going to use Chrome, just because.
00:07:05.042 - 00:07:10.576, Speaker B: It'S nicer, I guess. Yeah.
00:07:10.758 - 00:07:27.240, Speaker A: Let's say I can just sign in with Google. How many clicks was that? And yeah, that's it.
00:07:29.370 - 00:07:30.120, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:30.510 - 00:07:44.910, Speaker A: We also have support for ERC 71. So all your collectibles are just going to show up here and I can just simply transfer them using our transfer modes. You can see that there are multiple transfer modes. We also have something like a contact.
00:07:44.980 - 00:07:45.600, Speaker B: Book.
00:07:47.410 - 00:07:57.378, Speaker A: Where I can send to people who already are present and we can also send to Google email reddit username or Discord ID. Okay, I'm just going to try the Google email. I'm going to send it to one.
00:07:57.384 - 00:07:58.500, Speaker B: Of my colleagues here.
00:07:59.590 - 00:08:11.558, Speaker C: Anybody here uses Gmail who's actually never signed in with Targets? That's one of our best use cases. You can send money to someone who has actually never signed in with Targets and then when they sign in, the money is there.
00:08:11.644 - 00:08:11.942, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:11.996 - 00:08:16.342, Speaker A: So let's demo that right now. Who wants to share their Google address?
00:08:16.476 - 00:08:16.918, Speaker B: Free.
00:08:17.004 - 00:08:17.766, Speaker A: What's your email?
00:08:17.868 - 00:08:45.700, Speaker B: Free. Nadeeth. Samisamitannir@gmail.com, can you spelling S-A-M-I-T-A-N-N-I-R? Yeah, that's correct. Okay, so, yeah, I'm going to just transfer you that kitty. There's a pop up there.
00:08:46.950 - 00:08:48.434, Speaker A: It takes some time to load my.
00:08:48.472 - 00:08:58.850, Speaker B: Theme because I'm using themes for now. And also the kitty confirm, confirm, allow.
00:08:58.920 - 00:09:02.440, Speaker A: Some notifications and yeah, just wait for it to finish.
00:09:03.370 - 00:09:09.206, Speaker B: I can also be on ether scan now.
00:09:09.228 - 00:09:12.274, Speaker C: If you log in with that account, your Credential be there.
00:09:12.412 - 00:09:20.720, Speaker A: Yeah, log into Taurus with that account. I mean, once this ether scan transfer is complete, just a higher gas price, right?
00:09:22.850 - 00:09:23.950, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, done.
00:09:24.100 - 00:09:26.142, Speaker A: It should just appear in your wallet right now.
00:09:26.196 - 00:09:30.286, Speaker B: If you just log in, we also.
00:09:30.308 - 00:09:56.182, Speaker A: Support multiple currencies and everything. You can explore our wallet to see what the different features are. We also support all the different networks. And you can see some networks which are in the hackathon also supported. And how to use a different Japanese endpoint from the hackathon. Just use RPC endpoint and then you can just enter the RPC URL here. Please make sure that you use HTPs URL.
00:09:56.246 - 00:09:59.980, Speaker B: Grave. I'm sorry? Grave. Yeah, it'll work.
00:10:01.070 - 00:10:03.510, Speaker C: You should enable pop ups and then clear cache.
00:10:03.590 - 00:10:11.374, Speaker A: Just enable pop ups, that's it. Yeah, you just enter the RPC URL and you should be good to go.
00:10:11.572 - 00:10:12.414, Speaker B: Okay.
00:10:12.612 - 00:10:17.630, Speaker A: To connect to a different endpoint. And yeah, there are themes.
00:10:23.200 - 00:10:29.490, Speaker B: Reloaded got it.
00:10:31.220 - 00:10:34.224, Speaker C: App dot dot s trying to log.
00:10:34.262 - 00:10:34.850, Speaker B: In.
00:10:37.460 - 00:10:49.508, Speaker C: Because sub kickback requires you to create an account. Yeah. So this is like one of the DAPs that integrated us, but if you want to go straight to the wallet, you can go to apptool.org. You can just have the wallet right away.
00:10:49.674 - 00:10:51.352, Speaker B: There you go. Yeah.
00:10:51.486 - 00:10:58.116, Speaker A: So the reason I said claim at the beginning, right, saying that taurus is the easiest integration in the hackathon, that's.
00:10:58.148 - 00:10:59.256, Speaker B: Just because of this you can see.
00:10:59.278 - 00:11:05.016, Speaker A: The basic there and that's all the length of code which you need to write to be honest to integrate with taurus.
00:11:05.048 - 00:11:05.820, Speaker B: That's it.
00:11:05.970 - 00:11:10.430, Speaker A: Okay, import taurus, import web3 in it, login done.
00:11:11.280 - 00:11:11.884, Speaker B: Okay.
00:11:12.002 - 00:11:51.816, Speaker A: And you also have a huge amount of customization which you can do. Here are the options for customization. We do have TypeScript bindings so that it's easier for you to specify all the parameters and everything. We also have sample examples for you, which you can see here in the taurus embed repo. This is the main repo of the NPM package which are using and the examples folder here. There are a couple of react examples and one view example, you can just look at how we implement it there. And we also have the API reference which basically documents more of it.
00:11:51.838 - 00:11:58.444, Speaker B: I guess you can see all the.
00:11:58.482 - 00:11:59.532, Speaker A: Types of bindings and everything.
00:11:59.586 - 00:11:59.804, Speaker B: Okay.
00:11:59.842 - 00:12:46.430, Speaker A: For initialization, you can optionally enable only certain types of Verifiers you want for your DAP, in the sense that you don't want people to log in through Facebook, let's say, because you have privacy concerns, then you can just disable Facebook or the app by passing in something like this. Enable verifier Facebook as false and just Facebook won't show up, the rest of them will show. If you want to integrate with one of the scale here, let's say, and this is just integration you need to use while initialization and get public addresses here, which requires Verifier and Verifier ID. So right now the resolver is only for Google reddit and discord. Okay, so surely you can use one of them.
00:12:48.800 - 00:12:49.550, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:50.000 - 00:13:23.940, Speaker A: Coming to set provider, if you want to change network from within the DAP, you can just do that. There's always examples written for everything at the bottom here, and this is the main login one. So you can specify to directly log in with a specific Verifier by default instead of letting the user choose which type of login you want. So that's also possible. And the get user info basically returns you the email name, profile, image, verifier and verifier ID of the user.
00:13:24.020 - 00:13:25.096, Speaker B: This is one of the features which.
00:13:25.118 - 00:13:39.528, Speaker A: You can use to basically make sure you can create your own login management system, auth management system. The logout logs you out. Basically cleans up everything related to taurus. Show wallet shows the opens the wallet directly.
00:13:39.544 - 00:13:42.430, Speaker B: You can also open it as a specific page as well.
00:13:43.520 - 00:14:02.516, Speaker A: Within the wallet, it opens everything in a pop up. The web3 and ethereum objects are by default, so we provide the exact same API as MetaMask. So you can also access those APIs directly instead of using the Torah specific APIs because the functionalities are internally the same. All the tour's API internally react to.
00:14:02.538 - 00:14:09.290, Speaker B: The different APIs which are provided to MetaMask as well. And I guess that's it.
00:14:11.340 - 00:14:43.680, Speaker A: Kind notes here. Okay, if you're developing on Ganache, we have a small package called as Ganache HTP proxy, which basically routes your Ganache traffic through https localhost eight five. Because our website is run on HTPs, you can only connect HTPs endpoints to it. Okay. I'm pretty sure all of the other people, all of the other side chains, they also provide a HTPs endpoint. So we can just use that. But if they don't, we can use this to use a proxy to create a HTPs network.
00:14:43.680 - 00:14:52.096, Speaker A: Yeah, and if you still face some issues, just allow insecure localhost just accept localhost certification, your browser.
00:14:52.128 - 00:14:52.468, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:52.554 - 00:15:01.592, Speaker A: That should basically take care of everything. And for Angular users, you need to basically install a couple more packages, like process and buffer, I guess.
00:15:01.646 - 00:15:10.590, Speaker B: Yeah, that's it. I think that's it, right?
00:15:11.600 - 00:15:17.900, Speaker A: The rest of it is pretty straightforward. Let me show you a small DAP integration.
00:15:21.860 - 00:15:25.120, Speaker B: Do we have a DAP? Kickback. Kickback.
00:15:46.540 - 00:15:48.280, Speaker A: Is the server in Singapore?
00:15:51.900 - 00:15:56.812, Speaker B: Yeah, it looks like it's in Singapore. Okay, I can just sign in.
00:15:56.866 - 00:15:59.964, Speaker A: I can just choose taurus over there.
00:16:00.162 - 00:16:10.070, Speaker B: Takes a couple of seconds, and then you can just use taurus.
00:16:12.990 - 00:16:18.010, Speaker A: Takes a couple of seconds to basically get all the shares from the nodes.
00:16:26.490 - 00:16:37.178, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm in. Basically, that's it. I just don't want to create a new account with Kickback right now.
00:16:37.344 - 00:16:45.120, Speaker A: But you can see the public address popped up there, which means that the Torus login worked. Okay, that's one of the easiest integrations which you have.
00:16:45.490 - 00:16:46.846, Speaker B: There are a couple of other which.
00:16:46.868 - 00:16:50.800, Speaker A: You can check out, like oneland IO, I think.
00:16:54.990 - 00:16:58.238, Speaker B: Yeah, that's one of them.
00:16:58.404 - 00:17:08.190, Speaker A: It has taurus here, and there's also web3 connect, which you guys might know. This basically allows you to have multiple providers. Taurus is one of them.
00:17:08.340 - 00:17:10.100, Speaker B: Okay? Yeah.
00:17:11.190 - 00:17:19.840, Speaker A: So right now so do you guys have any questions? So you do agree with Michael?
00:17:20.900 - 00:17:27.168, Speaker B: It's the easiest integration in the hackathon. Okay, good. That's it, right?
00:17:27.334 - 00:17:42.728, Speaker C: That's clear. If you guys have any security related questions like how the actual cryptography works, feel free to ask me. Explain the flow and everything to show how it's actually decentralized, how we don't actually see the private key, and any concerns you guys might have.
00:17:42.814 - 00:17:43.450, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:44.380 - 00:17:48.452, Speaker A: Feel free to reach out to us. We'll be there. Around in and around the hackathon, everywhere.
00:17:48.516 - 00:17:49.130, Speaker B: Okay?
00:17:49.740 - 00:17:51.128, Speaker A: I think you're out of time already.
00:17:51.214 - 00:17:52.090, Speaker B: What the hell?
00:17:57.260 - 00:18:02.930, Speaker C: Actually, the site loads only after you get the shares back, so it's actually on your local country right now.
00:18:06.180 - 00:18:12.130, Speaker A: I think we're out of time, actually. It's 1058. You guys don't have any questions? That's it.
00:18:13.620 - 00:18:14.030, Speaker B: Thank you.
