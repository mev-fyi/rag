00:00:06.250 - 00:00:06.462, Speaker A: Right.
00:00:06.516 - 00:00:41.574, Speaker B: Hey, guys, I'm akshay. So, yeah, just to remind you guys, you have to connect your headsets to channel two so that you can listen to me, not the other session. But yeah. So, by the way, I'm Akshay and I work for Leifi and we have great shirts. So come to oh, we have great shirts. Come to our booth and pick up the shirts and yeah, so let's start. To begin with, I'm just going to give you a short intro about Lefi.
00:00:41.574 - 00:01:39.070, Speaker B: So Lefi is a bridge and dex aggregator. So we're kind of like one inch for bridges. If you are bridging from one chain to other chain, we find you the best route through various bridges that we have. We currently have 15 bridges and like countless DEXes inside Lefi. So for now, I'm going to let you guys scan this for this presentation as well as all the links that I will have in the presentation. So, yeah, after the presentation you can get the links and while you're hacking as well. So you guys want to scan give five more seconds.
00:01:39.070 - 00:02:15.926, Speaker B: Okay, so these are the links that we're going to be using. I mean, you're going to have to use if you're hacking with Lefi. First, of course, the website, we have our front end as well. If you want to bridge from any chain to any chain, just like go to transfer two XYZ here. And yeah, we have a crazy UI through which you can bridge from any token on any chain to any token on any chain. So we also have SDK, we have API docs examples. I'll go with the links again.
00:02:15.926 - 00:02:19.250, Speaker B: So what exactly is the problem that Lefi is solving?
00:02:19.330 - 00:02:19.622, Speaker A: Right?
00:02:19.676 - 00:02:31.642, Speaker B: So why do we even need Lefi? So, of course you can go to individual bridges, individual DEXes to do swaps and bridging manually and it's still going to be fine. You're still going to make it.
00:02:31.696 - 00:02:31.962, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:32.016 - 00:03:40.094, Speaker B: But what Leaf is doing is that we are aggregating all these things into a single interface so that you don't have to worry about the various DEXes that are there and the fees that they might be charging you and if they are secure or not, nobody knows, right? Everything's on the blockchain. And unless you verify, unless you can verify, you can't know whether the bridge you're using or DEXes you're using is right or not. So I want to give you an example of why a product like Lefi would actually make a lot of sense. So recently we were supposed to get merch for the hackathon, of course. And yeah, we faced a lot of issues because there were no aggregators which were aggregating t shirts for hackathons. So what happened was that we got designs done online, of course, and we chose a printer based in Germany and they told us they're going to print all those things to us and they're going to ship it to India, to Bangalore. So that we can deliver, give it to you guys.
00:03:40.094 - 00:04:23.546, Speaker B: But we faced so many issues because this German company, they gave the contract to Latvia, then to Bangladesh, then to US, then they shipped each of the shipments through FedEx to India, and at FedEx, I had to go through KYC, I had to pay unknown fees, I had to make cash payment. Like FedEx, I'm paying like thousands of rupees when they're delivering much to me, right? But I would not have cash at all. They're expecting me to pay all that money in cash. And it was a huge mess. I had no idea this would happen at all. So this whole thing can be I mean, all I want is that as a customer, I just have designs for T shirts. I just want to get merch at ETH.
00:04:23.546 - 00:04:23.962, Speaker B: India.
00:04:24.026 - 00:04:24.350, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:24.420 - 00:05:06.566, Speaker B: That's my only goal. And all these extra steps that I had to go through. And this was very stressful in the last one week, sorry, one month. And these things as an end user, I don't have to know all these things, all these details. So instead, what you can do is that's the same thing happens with swapping as well. If you have Matic on polygon and you want to get GMX on Arbitrum and stake GMX, you have to go to several steps. You have to choose a Dex, then get USDC, use Hop to Bridge to Arbitrum again, use Uniswap to swap to GMX and stake GMX.
00:05:06.566 - 00:05:45.206, Speaker B: All these steps. And each of these steps would have various fees, various security assumptions and various bottlenecks, right? And as an end user, I would not know each and every detail about all the things that I'm going to use. Right? So what we do at Leaf is that we just kind of abstract everything here. And all you are going to see is that you're going to choose Matic, that you have Matic on polygon and you're going to stake GMX on Arbitrum with a single transaction. That's what we do at Lefi. I mean, that's exactly what I wanted for Lee Merch as well, but nobody is there working on that. So soon I'll be able to do it.
00:05:45.206 - 00:06:06.254, Speaker B: I guess some aggregate is going to be there, but yeah. So this is what we do at Lefi. We abstract away all the nuances, all the steps that you have to take to swap one token on one chain to a different token on different chain as well as do another action on top if you wish to, like, staking GMX here. So you guys are with me till now. Thumbs up.
00:06:06.292 - 00:06:07.760, Speaker A: Yeah. Great.
00:06:09.010 - 00:06:36.994, Speaker B: Okay, so this is our core protocol, right? Like, we help people swap tokens and deposit funds. And we have this core protocol. We have several products which is using this protocol, you can build so many things on protocols. And LiFi is also a protocol that means you can build things on Lefi as well. So that's why we are sponsoring this hackathon. And I'm also going to talk about the bounties that we have. So we have several products.
00:06:36.994 - 00:07:37.578, Speaker B: One is transfer two XYZ which is our front end. If you want to go to Arbitram and stake or buy something on Arbitrum and NFT you can use transfer to two XYZ and then reach to Arbitrum using LiFi in the back end and buy an NFT. Similarly, we have a widget which as a mean of course you're all builders and hackers, right? So if you are deploying your smart contracts on Arbitrum then that means that all of your users would have to transfer funds from where they have funds in to Arbitrum to use your DAP. So it's a hassle for a new user who is not very DJ. So what you can do is you can just plug lee's widget onto your website and directly let users swap from any chain to your token on your chain. And we have a widget and we also have SDK. If you don't feel like you want to have a widget which is built by us, the UI is built by us.
00:07:37.578 - 00:08:31.182, Speaker B: You can just use our SDK, and you can build your own UI. And you would have, of course, have a lot more customizability options, and it's a lot more linear to use your own SDK and UI. We also have APIs so it's kind of going bare bone from the widget with the widget is where you can just plug it in in five minutes and start using it. It's very easy, right? It's like the wrapped version of LiFi as a protocol and the SDK is kind of like in the middle where the functions are wrapped. If you're a developer, you'd know the functions are wrapped and you can easily just call functions and perform actions or perform swaps. But APIs are like bare bones where you get APIs and you would have full freedom to do anything that you want. We have APIs and you can just pull our we have unlimited there's no limit right now at least.
00:08:31.182 - 00:09:54.450, Speaker B: So we can use our APIs. So I mean, even if you go even down below the APIs, you can also interact directly with our smart contracts which are Lefi smart contracts. Your smart contract can directly interact with Leafy smart contract and perform actions. So for example, if you are Yearn and if you are an yield aggregator and you want to move your funds to Arbitram and then deposit into a pool and then get the yield back to let's say polygon, right? So you can do all those things using a smart contract and you would need LiFi smart contract for that. So these are our various products. I'm going to go through these things in this session, of course each of these things so that you guys can decide what you want to use in this hackathon. I do want to touch upon the ideas before I dive into anything to build on so that you guys have an idea of what is Lefi, what can I do with Lefi? Can I build something cool here? And is Lefi alone enough to build something? If you use LiFi alone, of course, just by using LiFi, you can build so many cool apps, right? And we have Bounties, which supports we're just going to, of course, give you this is not updated.
00:09:54.450 - 00:10:55.016, Speaker B: Okay, so to start with SDK, right, the SDK that I spoke about, which directly interacts with our APIs and get your codes on front end, if you want to swap from one token to other token, you're just like passing these two tokens as parameters to our SDK and you're fetching the codes for these tokens. And to show you an example of using SDK, we have built, of course, our front end on LiFi's SDK as well. So this front end that you see is built on leaf SDK, and you are choosing a token like, let's say, oh, I like GMX a lot, so I'm choosing GMX on Arbitrum. And I'm going to get ETH on optimism. I'm going to swap 20 tokens. Of course, the Internet is very slow here, so I might not even get routes. But usually you get several routes on the right side as you swap.
00:10:55.016 - 00:11:17.872, Speaker B: And as a user, you can choose what route that you're comfortable with. It can be based on your favorite bridge that you trust, or it can be through like, a native bridge. Arbitram native bridge as well. So, yeah, the SDK works this way, where you pass these two parameters, GMX and Arbitrum to Ethan optimism and 20 tokens.
00:11:17.936 - 00:11:18.260, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:18.330 - 00:11:28.360, Speaker B: You're going to pass these three things and we're going to fetch you so many quotes can be 1020 based on the chains and tokens that you have chosen.
00:11:29.820 - 00:11:30.570, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:31.260 - 00:12:02.230, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, we found one route. Sadly, usually we find so many routes to do these swaps. Oh, I have disabled other bridges. So, yeah, another cool feature about Lefi that I kind of have to show right now is that we have a feature to enable and disable bridges at Lefi. We have several bridges, twelve plus bridges. And I had disabled all the bridges because I trust Connex and Stargate a lot more. But yeah, I mean, I like all the bridges, to be honest.
00:12:02.230 - 00:12:19.802, Speaker B: So now we'll get a lot more routes. I'll come back to this. So to start with, what can you build? What can you as a hacker build with Lee Fi using just the SDK?
00:12:19.866 - 00:12:20.286, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:20.388 - 00:12:49.986, Speaker B: So on the front end, you can just build a cross chain yield aggregator. So USDC, of course, everybody wants to hold USDC these days because nobody knows how down we're going to go from here. So if you are holding USDC and you want to earn some yield on USDC, then you can use Lefi and aggregate. So, I mean, you would have to go through various DApps, various chains, various yield aggregators and find the best yield and then deposit into that yield.
00:12:50.018 - 00:12:50.262, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:50.316 - 00:14:01.994, Speaker B: So instead you can just build this interface using LiFi where you can aggregate yield for USDC on various chains, moon, River, Moonbeam, which are new chains and they're going to offer a lot more higher yields than Arbitram optimism which are like old and secure. So you can aggregate these different yields on different platforms and you can just give your users just a single button to deposit into these vaults through Lefi. So as what you can imagine is that like USDC on Arbitrum, USDC on optimism and a user just like it's going to select one USDC on optimism which is going to give you 5% yield unheard of. And yeah, the user is going to select USCC on optimism and just click deposit and the Leafy is going to bridge the funds from wherever they have the funds in, for example, polygon, bridge to optimism, then deposit into pools. And yeah, you can just do that in the single interface that you are going to aggregate on your front end. That's one of the easiest things you can build on Lefi. And yeah, so we're also partnering with Etherspot.
00:14:01.994 - 00:14:43.190, Speaker B: Etherspot is a smart contract wallet. So Etherspot helps you in automating these things kind of like vaults. So you can use that as well to make it much, much better. So you can use LiFi and Etherspot together again. So LiFi, of course, it's also a great standalone product, but it works better with smart contract wallets. So you can use Leaf and Ether, spot, you can borrow assets crosschain. So I mean, one of the things that are in Hype these days is that crosschain borrowing where you can deposit ETH on Ethereum and you can borrow USDC on Arbitrum or optimism.
00:14:43.270 - 00:14:43.706, Speaker A: Right?
00:14:43.808 - 00:15:29.830, Speaker B: So this thing is being built on layer zero or Axela, these different messaging protocols. But I'm not going to go deep into it. But these protocols are great, but they add another security assumption to you as a user, right? So instead what you can do is that you can still have the exact same experience, but you can build that with Leafy and Etherspot with a lot less security assumptions than building on Crosschain, like fully native crosschain. So, yeah, we also have partnered with GoPocket wallet. So if you wish, you can just build a wallet on your own and integrate LiFi and make it cross chain wallet from day one. And yeah, cross chain wallets are great. We have a few wallets that have integrated LiFi.
00:15:29.830 - 00:16:14.662, Speaker B: They are frontier, they are Omni, these wallets have integrated LiFi. And through this people can do a lot more cross chain things and deposit into different chains and do a lot more things. So another thing is multi hopping. That's something you can build with, which is that which means that, for example, let's say you have funds on phantom and you want to get your funds on avalanche, right? So this is very hard because there's not much liquidity between these two chains. So ideally you would have to go from Phantom to ETH, then to avalanche. So this is called multi hopping. You are going through a different chain to go to a different chain.
00:16:14.662 - 00:16:46.500, Speaker B: So this thing can be built using leafy. And currently we don't have that. We are trying to have that. So we are offering so I have to update this. We're offering $2,500 for using SDK plus Widget. SDK or widget thousand 250. And you can find these prices on ETH global website.
00:16:46.500 - 00:17:40.530, Speaker B: We're offering these bounties in this hackathon. So please build on DeFi and of course you're going to get these things. So I'm going to talk about contract calls as well. So I gave you an example when I started this presentation, which is that you can stake on GMX, right? So usually you would have to swap on GMX, swap to GMX on Arbitrum, and then perform another action to stake into GMX, which can be automated using exchange contract calls that we have, which what it does after the bridging happens, after the swapping happens, it calls another function which deposits funds into GMX on Arbitrum. So the end user is going to be only performing only one action, just going to be, let's say like USDC on polygon. You're just doing that, that's it. And everything is else is going to be taken care by bridges and LiFi.
00:17:40.530 - 00:18:15.790, Speaker B: So that's something you can check out as well. Of course, if you build only on cross train contract calls, which is a new feature that we have. We have separate bounties for this, $2,000, $1,000, $500. And we also have Widget bounties, which I combined with the first bounties now. So there's going to be another fourth prize here, six, seven minutes. Okay, so I don't have much time, but I'll be in our booth. So you can feel free to ask me.
00:18:15.790 - 00:18:36.200, Speaker B: You can come drop by. We also have a game in the booth. So come by the booth and play the game. You can earn some tokens too. So I'll be near the booth. You can ask me for any questions that you have about crosschain, even if it's not related to Lee Fi, anything, crosschain, multi chain, bridging. I'm open to answering any of the questions that you guys might have.
00:18:36.200 - 00:19:10.002, Speaker B: So I want to touch upon before kick me out. I'm just going to talk about how we can start building right now. So we have examples. So of course, in this presentation we have something called we have Widget examples, which are very simple to start with, right? And of course, after you are familiar with a Widget, you can move on to SDKs, APIs and counter calls as well, which are a lot more complicated. But Widget is just like five minutes, a lot more complicated. I mean, like five minutes to 2 hours to probably one day.
00:19:10.056 - 00:19:10.562, Speaker A: Right?
00:19:10.696 - 00:19:43.690, Speaker B: Not too hard for a dev. So we have examples, for example, of create react app. You can check this out. I use NextJS. This is pretty simple because this widget is also an SDK on JavaScript. It's a JavaScript on TypeScript SDK and you can import the widget and you can just plug it in on your UI. It can be anywhere on your UI.
00:19:43.690 - 00:20:00.280, Speaker B: So a few things that I want to touch upon, since I don't have much time, is that this widget is fully customizable and you can just do so many things with this widget because this is kind of stuck.
00:20:02.980 - 00:20:03.344, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:03.382 - 00:21:09.808, Speaker B: So this widget, you can control all the UI elements that you can see on the widget from outside the widget, which is very useful if you are building something like something like this. So we built this recently and it uses only Lee five widget. And I feel it's very useful for sure, because it aggregates a few things. Okay, yeah. So this is like one basic example where I have a few buttons here, if you guys can see I'm not a great front end dev. Sorry. So what we can do is that I can just control the wallet, control the widget from outside the widget.
00:21:09.808 - 00:21:40.860, Speaker B: That means that you can build a lot more things on top of this. For example, USDC can change the token ETH from outside. So, I mean, a better version of this is obviously this is probably running on one. Yeah, this is slow. Oh, no, decline, decline.
00:21:58.720 - 00:21:59.084, Speaker A: Okay.
00:21:59.122 - 00:22:29.192, Speaker B: So this is something that I built, that we built a few days back, a few weeks back, which is an aggregate, I mean, which is a way to store your friend's address or your centralized exchange address on our DAP. And you can easily send money from any chain that you have to that centralized exchange in a single transaction. For example, if you want to add a new wallet, let's say Binance, I trust Binance and I want to get ETH on Binance, and I have some.
00:22:29.246 - 00:22:29.850, Speaker A: Address.
00:22:37.720 - 00:23:21.520, Speaker B: Let'S say Binance main. So I have this address that I've just added, and of course I can save this address on this website. You can just build a simple DAP, which is very useful. Currently, what we do as Djens when we want to off ramp money from one chain to Binance for to, let's say I have optimism funds, I have to bridge to BSc chain or like polygon or Ethereum to deposit into Binance. But instead what you can do is that let's say I have funds on even like, let's use chain, like, let's say avalanche, right? I have AVAX on Avalanche and I want ETH on Binance.
00:23:21.600 - 00:23:21.940, Speaker A: Right?
00:23:22.010 - 00:24:36.230, Speaker B: So you can just have such a way that it just selects everything is populated. Oh, I have to connect my wallet. Oh yeah, that's not working because I just connected my frame wallet. So yeah, so the ideally if you have IVACs on Avalanche and then if you have 20 of that and you want to get to finance on you want to get to finance, you can just build a simple app like this where I just sends you to finance. You can just bridge in a single transaction which is I feel very cool. So yeah, you can build something like this. It's like a very generic DAP and you can also build a DAP where you can add your friends as receiver addresses and send funds to your friends.
00:24:36.230 - 00:25:15.442, Speaker B: That's also something you can build. But yeah, I think I'm happy to answer any of the questions that you guys might have in the booth. Feel free to reach out to me on telegram at akshay underscore Lefi and Discord. Join our discord and ask for support as well. I can also show you a few examples that are built using Lefi. One is that so recently MetaMask integrated Leafy to support Bridging inside MetaMask. So if you go to portfolio MetaMask IO you can see Leefi being used in the back end.
00:25:15.442 - 00:26:01.360, Speaker B: So these guys use API because MetaMask wants a lot more freedom, right? So MetaMask wanted APIs so they have integrated our APIs. We also have Dodo Exchange integrated using us, they are using our SDK. We also have Superfluid using us, they're using our Widget. So we have three examples of different DApps using Leafy. And if you are building any project and if you aim to deploy on any of the L two chains or side chains that we support, I mean currently we support EVM, we are going to expand to non EVM as well. Feel free to reach out to me, reach out to us. We're going to help you guys integrate Lefi into your DAP so that you can help your users onboard in a much much easier or seamless manner to your chain and use your DAP without much.
00:26:01.360 - 00:26:22.082, Speaker B: So I'm going to give you guys like two minutes to scan the QR code, join our discord. You can also scan this QR code instead to get this presentation and get all the links at once. So if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer.
00:26:22.136 - 00:26:22.980, Speaker A: Right now.
00:26:42.190 - 00:26:58.046, Speaker B: I can't hear him though it's too I think yeah, no, yeah. Okay, now I can hear you. Nice.
00:26:58.148 - 00:27:12.994, Speaker C: So I want to ask like let's suppose you are saying supplying token from one chain to another chain. Let's suppose at the same time second chain got very high fluctuation and second transaction got failed. How you are handling that?
00:27:13.112 - 00:27:41.002, Speaker B: Yeah, so of course. So this happens a lot. You would know, especially in crypto, right? So what we have is that we have slippage parameter that we set. Of course you have access to set this slippage on SDK, API and XML contracts. So if you set slippage like 0.5%, the final transaction is going to make I mean the contract is going to make sure that the deviation isn't like, more than 0.5% for the end token.
00:27:41.146 - 00:27:49.826, Speaker C: If it does, that is like, for one chain, but when we are going to another chain, it is not an atomic swap, how you are handling that.
00:27:49.848 - 00:28:19.910, Speaker B: Thing, even for the destination chain. So this slippage is actually for Cross chain. That means that, as you can see here, GMX and Arbitram to Ethan optimism. This tokens, like 20 tokens, is like $1,075, right? So the final amount should not actually go below $1,075 with 0.5% slippage. So if it does, the transaction fails and you get the money back on where you are. That's like any other slippage.
00:28:19.990 - 00:28:20.780, Speaker A: Got it.
00:28:21.710 - 00:28:24.218, Speaker B: But I can play around with the slippage to make sure.
00:28:24.304 - 00:28:25.962, Speaker C: Yeah, I will get to your booth. Short.
00:28:26.096 - 00:28:27.740, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:28:28.270 - 00:28:36.340, Speaker B: One more minute. Okay. Any other questions? It.
00:28:41.180 - 00:28:41.930, Speaker A: Okay.
00:28:49.010 - 00:29:45.910, Speaker B: Let's see. I have this link over there as well. And yeah, just like, go through these ideas and you guys can definitely come up with something much, much more creative, for sure. If you have any ideas and if you're still brainstorming as well. And you want to build on Crosschain. Crosschain is like the need for the near future, right? So people would want I mean, it's ideal to build on Crosschain because there's a lot of need from end users to bridge between chains because the chains are exploding right now, right? So we have all these optimistic bridges. So optimistic chains roll ups, like optimism, Arbitram, Boba, and we're also going to have ZK roll ups in the future so that before the chains consolidate, the chains are going to explode in the near future, in the next one year or two years.
00:29:45.910 - 00:30:14.140, Speaker B: So I think it's ideal time to start building on Crosschain or building Crosschain DApps solving Crosschain problems, because everybody's facing these problems, all of us. So, yeah, I mean, I wish good luck to you, all of you in this hackathon, all the hackers. I'm happy I'll be around in our Lefi booth. We have a game and we have merch, really good merch, by the way, and yeah, I'll see you guys over there. Thank you.
