00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.102, Speaker A: That's okay.
00:00:01.236 - 00:00:20.880, Speaker B: Cash is funding early stage startups that are seeking ways to improve climate change. Is that the purpose of what you're wanting to do or are you wanting to figure out how to be able to bring the cryptosphere into funding? Early stage startups in general?
00:00:22.370 - 00:01:13.250, Speaker C: So where I'm at with my search so far is that the capital requirements of climate startups is higher than that of software startups. So I was thinking about how the beachhead market for general seed stage and angel stage funding would be climate startups. But then you could expand from that into a general protocol for startups, for VC funding in general. There's a lot of work involved to setting up a Dow that can receive funding, give funding, be an investor. And maybe there is something there where you could make it super easy to spin up a Dow for these purposes.
00:01:14.550 - 00:01:52.486, Speaker B: Well, for early stage funding, I mean, speaking just for the US. Right, having to be a registered broker dealer with FINRA for doing a raise to keep it really simple, I think you can focus on reg CF or reg D investments or raises which don't require a broker dealer. That way you can broaden the spectrum of potential investors and those that would be compliant within the Dow to be able to start that off and just focus on ways with which you can go about it requiring a broker dealer.
00:01:52.618 - 00:02:49.380, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And another idea this one was inspired by Stripe, is to sell carbon credits that haven't been made yet. So if you're a carbon capture startup and you don't have the funding required to build your pilot project, you can presell the carbon credit credits from the pilot project at a high rate to raise the funding for you to build the pilot project. So that might be an approachable thing we could do then maybe to distill this idea into something more concrete. You could do something where here's a website where you can crowdfund the sale of carbon credits for your climate carbon capture pilot project as a nice little thing.
00:02:50.630 - 00:03:01.602, Speaker B: Would the Dow be receiving equity in that startup for doing this or would it be just crowdfunding the idea, so to speak, as a platform to get some early stage investment but no equity.
00:03:01.666 - 00:03:04.950, Speaker D: Involved to keep it simple?
00:03:05.100 - 00:03:24.560, Speaker C: For the purposes of this hackathon, maybe we just skip away from equity because looking at the whole like ERC, 1400 or 22 something for figuring those out, there's a lot of question marks around the legal engineering and maybe that's just too much to bite off for this.
00:03:25.090 - 00:03:26.590, Speaker B: We'd love to connect after.
00:03:26.740 - 00:03:28.160, Speaker A: Sweet, me too.
00:03:28.690 - 00:03:31.920, Speaker C: And I abdicate the rest of my time to whoever's next.
00:03:33.670 - 00:03:46.918, Speaker A: Awesome, thanks for sharing that. And again, these conversations can continue. So track down people. We're going to add a discord link in the sign up sheet so you.
00:03:46.924 - 00:03:49.640, Speaker E: Can put your discord handle so people can follow up.
00:03:50.650 - 00:03:56.150, Speaker A: So our next team is or Hacker is Layer Exchange.
00:03:58.650 - 00:05:03.120, Speaker F: Hello, Simon here. Hello. Yeah, so this idea is basically taking LP tokens that you would be storing in pools or at least receiving from your assets that you put into different exchanges, different DEXes. However, you would have a vault in the middle which would create a synthetic USD version of that pair so that you can actually mimic what that LP receipt would be, store that LP token in the vault and then trade with yield markets at the same time. So in other words, it becomes a decentralized vault but you can also earn yield on it at the same time. And if there needs to be more clarity, I can go into more detail.
00:05:06.610 - 00:05:08.718, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely go into more detail.
00:05:08.804 - 00:05:09.600, Speaker G: This is.
00:05:13.650 - 00:06:17.190, Speaker F: So if you have you have a number of exchanges and if you're parking an asset, you get an LP token in return. Once you have that, you do of course might have the opportunity of earning off of that because as people are trading on these exchanges, then you get a commission. So if you could actually consider this as a yield opportunity as opposed to just it being stuck in the exchange, then you could have a vault in between so that you could allocate a synthetic version to other yield markets and therefore be able to keep your storage in those different exchanges whilst also earning yield at the same time on other markets.
00:06:21.690 - 00:06:33.000, Speaker A: That's interesting. Anybody have any thoughts or where he might look or anybody interested in joining the hack? That's also possible.
00:06:35.050 - 00:06:59.380, Speaker H: Yeah, this is Topper here. I think that's a pretty cool idea. I've actually been thinking a lot about these LP tokens. It's basically capital inefficient, right? Money just sits there not working. One thing we looked at a lot is options because it's a great underlying asset for selling options because you could sit there, yield and mostly have it sit there unless you have to pay out. Right?
00:07:02.550 - 00:07:45.970, Speaker F: Exactly. Ultimately, if you're able to gather enough users, you might end up with a peer to peer lending market in the end. But you really need to have a ton of users to make that possible. And of course it's been very difficult to get that type of product off the ground. I would love to chat with anybody to some depths as well, but I would really love to flesh out our smart contracts, what we have already and yeah, hopefully build something that would make good of this hackathon.
00:07:46.950 - 00:07:51.460, Speaker H: Didn't Ave start adding LP tokens as collateral or am I wrong about that?
00:07:52.550 - 00:07:53.620, Speaker G: Yeah, they.
00:07:56.570 - 00:07:57.766, Speaker A: Know you should reach out.
00:07:57.788 - 00:08:05.542, Speaker F: To the maybe I'm actually only yeah, yeah, definitely.
00:08:05.676 - 00:08:29.518, Speaker A: And just as a general, if you haven't done global hackathon before, definitely reach out directly to the sponsors and their channels. They have their technical teams here and they definitely want to just hear from you and play ideas, especially at the beginning when everybody's thinking about what you're building. So definitely reach out to great.
00:08:29.684 - 00:08:30.720, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:08:31.250 - 00:08:39.550, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you, Simon. And our next project is Hippodrome.
00:08:40.230 - 00:08:49.780, Speaker H: That's me. I was just talking to Topper. I'm going to leave my camera off. Sorry. I'm just in a spot where it's hard to turn it on at the moment. So hear me out on this. This is a little crazy.
00:08:49.780 - 00:09:24.930, Speaker H: So we're building a game. Crypto coliseum. It brings in a lot of kind of crypto curious or new folks to crypto. And one of the big things that they have, one of the big problems that they have is when they're trying to onboard onto blockchain. So we don't have any kind of fresh people who've never heard of crypto, but a lot of them maybe have some stuff on Binance or Coinbase or something like that and that's it. And so when they come to play a real blockchain game, they're like, oh, this is cool, I want to move on to Polygon. And also I hear there's cool yield on there and how do I do all that stuff right now? The answer is really hard for folks.
00:09:24.930 - 00:10:04.560, Speaker H: The Polygon bridge, at least it looks nice, but the actual material process of going through that is, okay, take your ETH from a central exchange, move it into your MetaMask on the ETH network. Make sure you're there. Now go to this bridge, follow the instructions there, which includes switching the network of your MetaMask after doing that. And then once you're on Polygon, okay, go to one inch or Aave or whatever you need to do now that you have this Ethan, you can do stuff there. And it's just like it's an extremely complicated system with gas fees the way they are now, it's not that expensive. It's like $8 or something like that. But when they go back to 100, it's like $100 to do that also.
00:10:04.560 - 00:10:49.638, Speaker H: And so what exists though, is Ren Protocol has a way to bridge dogecoin onto Polygon directly. And Doge, as crazy as it is, has some interesting characteristics. One being it's got really cheap transactions. It's like $2. And so for new users, the process could be, hey, go to this page, click a couple of buttons and there'll be an address to send your doge to. Send your doge there and then choose what output currency, you know, whether that's ETH or Matic or if you want to go know, here's a few safe yield devices, whether that's Aave or staker dow or something like that. And you just go directly from value on your centralized exchange.
00:10:49.638 - 00:11:09.250, Speaker H: Send it one transaction to this page and now you've ended up with a yield bearing asset or just Matic that you want to do something else with. So a way to super easy bring value from centralized exchanges and from people kind of new to the crypto space and bring them into the DeFi ecosystem.
00:11:10.950 - 00:11:23.640, Speaker G: That's really cool. I think we're always really excited to see any project that is focused on onboarding new to world hackers and people just into the space. I think we all benefit from that kind of work.
00:11:25.050 - 00:11:33.340, Speaker H: Yeah, it's funny, I've been in the space for a while and so I think of this stuff as easy, but we've just been working with so many more new users than I ever have before and it's like this stuff is so hard still.
00:11:37.630 - 00:11:41.870, Speaker A: Cool. Anyone else have any other thoughts?
00:11:44.690 - 00:11:50.720, Speaker G: Do you have a team currently or are you looking for specific help on your project?
00:11:51.330 - 00:12:53.586, Speaker H: We do have a team, but this is the kind of project where I would love the inputs come in. They have doge and maybe bitcoin for the more serious people or whatever, but the outputs I think are kind of interesting. Right? I think it's a cool Lego where you can have the choice of different things come out there. It's pretty cool. So we'd love to talk to anybody that's interested in that because I honestly believe that this will be the easiest way for people to get into Polygon. Oh, and the other thing I should say the other part of this is for the doge folks who are also crypto curious mostly, right? They mostly bought doge and they love the means and stuff, but there's nothing you can do with your doge right now. And so what this would actually offer is an incentivized liquidity pool on Polygon where you could take your doge, make more doge, which is actually I've been asking in their discord and stuff, is there anything I can do to make money on this? And the answer is generally like and I think Polygon and doge marry pretty well actually in terms of for the new folks, the low transaction costs and all that stuff is pretty good.
00:12:53.586 - 00:13:18.442, Speaker H: And then also right now, the brand, it takes like about an hour to bridge your doge over, which is kind of bad. But if doge folks wanted to make 0.1%/hour on their doge, they could offer like quick bridging. So basically it's a loan that you get to basically get your doge to matic in 3 seconds. And if you're long doge and you.
00:13:18.496 - 00:13:19.546, Speaker E: Really believe in it, you can make.
00:13:19.568 - 00:13:34.980, Speaker H: A decent amount of money with almost no risk just building up your doge. Anyway, my long winded way of saying anyone who's interested in the Polygon has projects on there and has kind of new folks that they want to bring in. We'd love to talk to them.
00:13:40.230 - 00:14:08.780, Speaker A: Cool, awesome. Thanks for bringing it up. And again, continue the conversation please, everyone. People are putting in their discord name, so if something triggers you later, reach out for sure. Thanks. Our next project or hacker is Favor Chiquido. Favor, are you?
00:14:11.630 - 00:14:12.794, Speaker H: Hi guys.
00:14:12.912 - 00:14:17.520, Speaker G: So a member of the team, Tapa just spoke about a project.
00:14:18.930 - 00:14:19.680, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:20.450 - 00:14:24.260, Speaker G: Yeah. So you're good, you're good.
00:14:28.390 - 00:14:33.060, Speaker A: So you are already on his team? Or are you interested? Is that what you're saying?
00:14:33.590 - 00:14:35.326, Speaker G: I'm already on his team.
00:14:35.448 - 00:14:38.246, Speaker H: Okay, yeah, sorry, miscommunication and putting stuff.
00:14:38.268 - 00:14:47.000, Speaker A: In the no worries. This is an informal discussion. How about hippodrome? Are you guys here?
00:14:47.390 - 00:14:51.050, Speaker H: That was us. Sorry, again, I don't know why this oh, Hippodrome.
00:14:53.630 - 00:15:00.102, Speaker A: I'm multitasking autonet. Autonet here.
00:15:00.256 - 00:15:00.960, Speaker D: Hi.
00:15:01.330 - 00:15:02.080, Speaker A: Hey.
00:15:02.850 - 00:15:42.246, Speaker D: Andre here. I'm a product manager from Bucharest, Romania. I'm working on this infrastructure, on this distributed infrastructure for training and running TensorFlow apps. So, AI apps, it sort of touches on what Kesh was saying. The first project, having this distributed investment framework. However, to keep it trustless, you need to have it closed loop. Like the production needs to be somehow on chain.
00:15:42.246 - 00:16:29.034, Speaker D: So, basically, this is something that I've been researching for a while. It's a way where TensorFlow developers can train their models for free and by having other investors pay for the training. And the training is basically, you can call it mining. The virtual machines that the miners run have all the libraries of TensorFlow. The client is based on Flutter, which has TensorFlow lite. And there are some MapReduce nodes. This is really technical, but there are some nodes that distribute the loads, the data set, and the instructions between the nodes that actually do the training.
00:16:29.034 - 00:17:58.760, Speaker D: And then once the models are mature enough to be actually commercially relevant, the revenue that they generate will be distributed between the developers and the people who invested in the training, if that makes sense. The reason why I think this is worth working on is just to allow anyone to be a shareholder of AI services. While human labor is becoming more irrelevant, more tasks are being automated. We need a way that anyone can share the revenue that AI models can generate and having it crowdsourced, we can have the price per call per invocation. It can be cheaper than the services that you get with Amazon, with Google, even though their data centers are much more optimized for training AI. Just the sheer scale of this network that blockchain mining has created allows us to price it more competitively. There are a bunch of challenges, but I'm past a proof of concept point.
00:17:58.760 - 00:18:27.360, Speaker D: I successfully distributed data sets and managed to account for the cycles that each node dedicates towards the training. So I'm not really sure what would be a relevant demo for this particular hackathon. What would be a relevant milestone? I'd be very interested to talk about that and other things that people might think about this project.
00:18:29.810 - 00:18:42.130, Speaker A: There's a couple of questions incoming in the chat here. I'm just going to read them out loud, if that's okay. One from HP Pranav. So how do you determine the split in rewards?
00:18:43.990 - 00:19:50.982, Speaker D: So, the way it's set up right now, the founding team or the dev team, you can call it either way, can get a maximum of 9%. This is just based on the effort, like the compute effort, it takes to actually get the model to commercially to be commercially relevant. Like, if you look at GPT-3, it would cost somewhere around $4 million to train it on AWS. So the founding team can get up to 9%, which can be just it can go to one address or it can be split between multiple addresses and the rest is just for the investor. So people, as they fund the project because they think based on the description and based on the developer's portfolio, they think that might make money. They get a percentage. Just like you would get in a company, you would get stuck in A-I-I think I addressed the question.
00:19:51.036 - 00:20:01.510, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, I don't know. Tariq has another question. I don't know if you have this sorted yet, but how does your pricing.
00:20:01.590 - 00:20:54.362, Speaker D: Compare to how does the pricing compare to cloud? Yeah, so I ran a couple of models to figure out how we would fare in terms of pricing. All indications are that we would get it lower, at least at half the price that you get for something like the natural language service through API calls that you get from Google Cloud or from AWS. There still needs to be more modeling on that. Done. But yeah, it seems like just from the sheer scale and the fact that it's crowdsourced, you would be able to get it lower. And the downside is that it's a token, ERC, seven. Seven token.
00:20:54.362 - 00:21:05.570, Speaker D: So once it starts trading, that's all volatile. So there needs to be a way to account for that. Sorry about the siren.
00:21:06.870 - 00:21:16.580, Speaker G: No worries. Are you looking for any teammates currently that could help you with this or any specific roles that yeah, that would be really cool.
00:21:18.550 - 00:21:31.930, Speaker D: Yeah, it would be really cool to have more people work on this with me or at least do some more of this brainstorming and figure out if it's something for them. So if you're interested I am eight right. In discord.
00:21:34.430 - 00:21:41.340, Speaker G: Sorry, let me rephrase. What kind of help could you need? Like developers? UX. UX help? Design help.
00:21:43.570 - 00:22:36.126, Speaker D: Not necessarily for UX and design, I think we're good on that. But anything related to data science, even answering this question, like how the price would be compared to Google Cloud or AWS, there's a lot of logical architecture to still develop and and we need to account for the mining nodes have their own Cadema implementation. They are separate from the main net. Right now, this can actually work on the main net. It needs to work on something on either 2.0 or layer two because there are too many transactions. The gas prices, it wouldn't work.
00:22:36.126 - 00:23:10.920, Speaker D: But there are lots of stuff to still model from a data analysis standpoint. So any help on that front would be really welcome and DevOps. I guess someone who has good knowledge of how distributed TensorFlow runs normally. If they worked on any infrastructures in the centralized world, that would be helpful.
00:23:13.920 - 00:23:43.830, Speaker A: Cool. In the interest of time, we'll keep moving. But everybody, the sign up sheet. Andre had put his discord handle there. So let's keep this conversation going. Yeah, and also remind people that if people are still searching for teams, this is an opportunity to sort of play with that idea. But also, there's team formation sessions coming up if people are still looking in the coming days.
00:23:43.830 - 00:23:58.072, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks, Andre. Our next team or project or hacker is Irrevocable. Are you here?
00:23:58.206 - 00:24:00.296, Speaker H: Hi, everybody.
00:24:00.398 - 00:24:46.936, Speaker E: My name is David Troy. I founded Irrevocable and Irrevocable, depending how you say it out loud. And I used to work in the art world, the art finance world, specifically. Actually, my thesis was on art markets and the emergence of art markets and how it developed in pastimes, namely from the Antwerp markets. Fun fact, Marathons was not an art market. Essentially, I used to work in New York 2014, where we used to collateralize Warhols for art, like asset backed loans and a few other like Frank Stellas and Robert Indianas and other financial mechanisms behind essentially, the put options that are set for most of these auction processes within Sotheby's. And Christie's, after that, worked at investment banking for a little while, but that's not important.
00:24:46.936 - 00:25:26.564, Speaker E: And, yeah, I kind of want to bring back a few of these art mechanisms that don't exist in the NFT world because it ends up being like 50% of all art sales are actually price floored before they even go to auction. So when you see anything that go to auction, sotheby's 50% is already collateralized in some form or fashion. So we're just introducing a familiar idea that already dominates the art world industry into crypto, because nobody has approached it that way. Specifically in the fact that you can actually use other artworks to protect the price of other artworks. You can actually use artworks to buy other artworks. You don't actually use cash. Nobody actually uses cash.
00:25:26.564 - 00:25:57.752, Speaker E: It's very debt driven, pre auction and post auction. There's actually probably a second line after the buyer's commission for Sotheby's. So essentially, you want to use other NFTs to guarantee the price of other NFTs before they even go on auction. And then you can create like, an entire game around it where you make money based on these betting market for where a price would go up or down. Currently, it's a whale to whale market, as they call it, or peer to peer. That's what we want to do for V One, and eventually we want to do a peer to pool. We're trying to avoid the auction before the auction scenario, which is a common issue.
00:25:57.752 - 00:26:17.350, Speaker E: But ideally for now, we want to create a tool where essentially you can use NFTs to protect the price of other NFTs or even buy other NFTs with NFTs or art for art. I'm just replacing art for art. And this is, again, 50% of all art sales that happens. Christie's and sotheby's wow.
00:26:19.560 - 00:26:26.650, Speaker A: That'S cool. And I'm just curious, you say you're coming from the art world.
00:26:27.420 - 00:26:49.810, Speaker E: I used to be in the art world, but then the art world isn't that glamorous. There's a joke that is driven by three things debt, divorce and debt. Yeah, those three things. And then I left the art world for a little while, never thought I'd be back to it. But it's a little more hopeful to be in the NFT world than the traditional art world, which is I mean, you're selling Impressionist paintings. Who owns those? Usually old people. So just the way it is.
00:26:49.810 - 00:27:31.884, Speaker E: There's a lot of mechanisms that's been involved since subdivision's existence since the 18th century and they've been using these background systems which has been essentially collusion, but I want to provide collusion as a service so anybody can use these mechanisms. So it's part of the same. The English bid system is such an inefficient way to provide bargaining power for the participants. The consigners should have more power. And this is what we're trying to offer because right now it's all the bidders and market forces which are extremely inefficient for English bids, which is dependent on the second highest bid. So the second highest bid determines the price because you wouldn't bid higher than the second highest bid or you would. Yeah.
00:27:31.884 - 00:27:43.730, Speaker E: And we would love to work with NFT lending platforms. We're trying to work with NFT lending platforms. We're not a marketplace, we're not a lending protocol and we're not fractionalizing, we're none of those. But we will collaborate with all of them.
00:27:45.940 - 00:27:46.688, Speaker A: Cool.
00:27:46.854 - 00:27:48.240, Speaker B: Can you share your discord?
00:27:48.900 - 00:28:27.440, Speaker E: Yeah, I just posted in the have. I have a backend engineer, he's anonymous guy. He doesn't want to share, but yeah, we're looking for a front end engineer to essentially build up this tool. We're not trying to build a company yet because this tool is only peer to peer. It doesn't really require a token, but essentially when it goes to peer to pool, that will require some level of cryptogonomics to get to that point because it is a coordination issue at that point. Right now it's purely a tool set that we want to see work and I want to demonstrate that you can essentially make money with your monolithic to bet on the sovereign mundi in that kind of scenario.
00:28:29.700 - 00:28:40.556, Speaker G: There was a pretty interesting question in the chat. They were wondering how you could avoid the same owner using multiple anonymous addresses over bidding to increase appraisal values.
00:28:40.748 - 00:29:05.260, Speaker E: We encourage it. That's totally normal. I mean, you're just bidding yourself, you're encouraging it. It's no different from you biding on your own self if there's an alternative person bidding on it. What we're promising is that you have a price floor. If you're under the price floor, you're going to buy anyways. The Chandelier bid system is a natural process and something you can't really avoid if you really want to increase the price, you can always increase it, but you might end up with your own bags.
00:29:05.260 - 00:29:39.972, Speaker E: This is an anonymous issue, but if they have the cash and collateral to do so, then they're just raising the price up for it. But in the end, they're the ones that are guaranteeing it. They're the guarantors. And yeah, wash trading is an issue, but it's symptomatic of any auction systems. You can try guaranteeing it with essentially a reputation system, but we're not going to build that. And yeah, you can reach out to me on Discord. I shared it on the hacker list.
00:29:39.972 - 00:29:55.390, Speaker E: And like I said, we're just looking for a front end dev, maybe UXUI, but we want to make it really simple, like a cool tool, like dispersed app or unitswap, that kind of level. No explanation page. Just guarantee it cool.
00:29:56.880 - 00:30:09.890, Speaker A: All right. Thanks, David. Appreciate it. Sounds cool. Moving on to our next project is Locit Locate. Are you here?
00:30:10.420 - 00:30:11.810, Speaker I: Yes, I'm here.
00:30:12.420 - 00:30:14.130, Speaker A: All right, let's hear.
00:30:14.900 - 00:30:34.160, Speaker I: Okay. Hi everyone. My name is Royal. I'm in South Africa. I first found out about the Ethereum hackathon. They had like a session in Cape Town and it was like my first experience in the blockchain space. And then I went over to doing a bit more hackathons, but not in the blockchain sphere.
00:30:34.160 - 00:31:02.048, Speaker I: I try to incorporate it in my kid startup. So it's called A lifecycle of a Kid and Tech. That's the name. Locate. So what we're looking to do is to decentralize the way kids learn, especially kids in the rural areas, because there is quite a struggle, especially in African countries. So what I'm trying to do is we're registering schools and getting sponsors and this is where the blockchain aspect would somewhat come in. If I can just go through the platform itself.
00:31:02.048 - 00:31:38.780, Speaker I: So we're looking at a PWA. The miner would enter the details being given by the teacher. So they'd have like a code. Then they'd select maybe they like soccer animals and then they'd select their learning styles, whether it's YouTube, song, peer to peer dance, storytelling quizzes, and then we move over to smart contracts. So because you're dealing with babies again, they would have to do something like a pinky promise. So this would ensure that they receive the reward at the end. So what they do is they'll get maybe 50 for mats, pick up litter in the community, participate in the sport, do dishes at home, then they pinky promise, then they pick a reward.
00:31:38.780 - 00:32:10.176, Speaker I: Then the Department of Education would come in here, give the content, then the teacher would curate the content by creating the quizzes. Then the child unlocks a lesson using augmented reality. Let's say, for example, they see a pyramid. Well, it is a pyramid, but then they'll think it's a triangle. Then they'll look at it from a historical standpoint, like the Great Pyramids of Egypt. And then it also helps with kids with the accessibility needs as well. Then we move over to quizzes again to reinforce learning, then they receive the reward.
00:32:10.176 - 00:32:56.880, Speaker I: So now the reward gets released because the sponsor would be paying for it. So this is where I would need a lot of help. But what the sponsor does is the sponsor actually pledges a certain amount to the school. If that particular class received or achieved the desired outcome, then only does the funds get released to the vendor. So then the vendor needs to be verified by the school and then after the vendor has been verified by the school, then the kids receive the reward. Let's say for example with the sponsors dashboard just a second. So what the sponsor would be looking at synthetic data of the miners to see if the class is actually achieving their goal.
00:32:56.880 - 00:33:21.630, Speaker I: Then they would see what the kids are looking for, maybe a trip to the zoo and then how much they're pledging. Then they get a notification if that particular school has completed their goals. And then they can transfer. The amount that they desire and then once everything is settled with the vendor and the school verifies then only do the kids get their reward. That's me.
00:33:25.540 - 00:33:31.890, Speaker A: That sounds really interesting. Do you have a team here? Is it just you?
00:33:32.980 - 00:34:07.124, Speaker I: Right now? It's just me. I am definitely looking for a team. I mainly work on the infrastructure side of things so I'm busy with obviously GCP stuff. So it's very GCP intensive. So that's looking at it from an infrastructure perspective. But when it comes to the blockchain aspect clueless. But I know I want to use it and I feel like it would be the best fit for it because it gives the sponsors the freedom to know that they've got an order trail.
00:34:07.124 - 00:34:19.330, Speaker I: It's transparent, they've got a surety as to where their money is going and where it's being invested and if their kids or the school that they're investing in is actually achieving their goals and it motivates the kids to actually achieve them as well.
00:34:20.820 - 00:34:32.070, Speaker G: What kind of help specifically would be useful for you right now in building a team? Front end, back end type work or are you looking for someone with specific knowledge of the education space?
00:34:33.240 - 00:34:49.050, Speaker I: Definitely back end with blockchain experience. I think I am able to be fine with the front end side of things. So I think that'll be okay. It's just mainly the back end and just integrating the blockchain systems with the platform itself.
00:34:54.770 - 00:35:06.980, Speaker G: That's awesome. I'm always excited to see hacks focusing on education and use cases. I think that's a really good market to touch and it's a very needed assistance right now.
00:35:08.470 - 00:35:28.460, Speaker I: And I think if the person is good with like offline because in some of these places it's so remote. So just something along those lines to be mindful of because the kids it's really remote areas and yeah, it's really bad. But I think with these technologies there's some good that. Can come from. It.
00:35:32.990 - 00:35:51.540, Speaker A: Also sounds just as a total aside, if the project gets legs, pretty sure the UN Foundation has a blockchain team that might do some grants and stuff for things in this area. So you might want to check them out.
00:35:52.150 - 00:36:22.780, Speaker G: That's something to be sort of cognizant of for all of you. Obviously, going for the prizes and trying to be finalists during this competition is of importance, but we've actually seen projects come out of these events that become full fledged companies that are still around today. So if your idea has legs, we can connect you with grants and the appropriate people to take that forward because we would love to see that grow.
00:36:24.670 - 00:36:49.540, Speaker I: Sounds awesome. I think just for me, maybe a little bit selfish, but I'm definitely springboarding my previous hackathon idea with the blockchain aspects. I'm like, okay, here's a blockchain hackathon. Do the blockchain things. So then I have to find another augmented reality one to springboard up with that as well. But, yeah, I'm excited to see what comes.
00:36:52.010 - 00:37:37.330, Speaker A: Cool. Well, yeah, your contact stuff is in the your discord handle is there for everyone in the sign in sheet. So if anyone is interested in talking further on this, you guys, again, encourage to keep these conversations going cool. Before I go into the next one, just a little announcement. At the moment, we're live streaming this event, but if anyone's watching on YouTube or on Twitter, we're going to end the live stream right now, even though the event is going to continue and we have this event recorded. But just everybody stay in the call here. But if you happen to be on YouTube, you'll have to wait till the recording gets posted.
00:37:37.330 - 00:37:47.638, Speaker A: So on that, our next project or team or hacker is Cam Harris. Cam, if you're here.
00:37:47.804 - 00:38:05.980, Speaker H: Hey, what's up, guys? My name is Cameron Harris. Just a quick background on myself. I participated in a previous E Global Web Three hackathon, and I built something called Livetube, which is just a video tube site that stored video.
