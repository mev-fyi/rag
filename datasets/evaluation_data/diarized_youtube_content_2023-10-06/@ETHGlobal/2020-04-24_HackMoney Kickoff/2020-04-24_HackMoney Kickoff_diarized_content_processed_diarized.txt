00:08:42.310 - 00:13:09.302, Speaker A: Welcome everybody. This is Kartik, and we're just going to wait a couple more minutes for a few more hackers to join in and we'll get started right after that. Hello, everybody. I am super excited to kick this off and welcome everybody here. So a few of us are still joining the Zoom Call, but as of right now, we have about 180 people on the Zoom chat and about a little over 50 that are just watching this live directly on YouTube and Twitter. So there's over 200 people watching this live right now, and I am excited to begin. So I am Kartik.
00:13:09.302 - 00:14:31.310, Speaker A: I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global. You may know me from the 50 emails I sent to all of you in the last few days, and it's my pleasure to welcome everybody here for Hack money. Now, I wanted to give some context into what made us start this event. So we've been thinking about doing an online event since last November, and we spent the last five months really trying to understand how online is different from in person events, especially events that are catered for developers. And not only that, how do you actually ensure that you can scale accordingly and scale up and make your reach broad from a developer standpoint without compromising on some key things that we think are essential into having a really good developer ecosystem? So we've been doing a lot of the in person events right now or as of until now. And when we ask our attendees on what could have been done better, the most common thing we hear is, I wish I had more time. And it makes total sense if you are a hacker and you are doing this for a weekend, two days is obviously not enough to learn something if you're new, but also make something that you're not only just proud of, but others can also use.
00:14:31.310 - 00:15:43.926, Speaker A: And on top of that, you kind of want to sleep too, so there's not a lot of hours for the things that you want to do. And it works really well as a playground to experiment, but we wanted to actually have a bridge to continuity on what happens after you come up with something over a weekend, especially if you're just curious about the space. So that's just kind of on the hacker side. Obviously, needing more time to build your project is a great thing, but on top of all that, oftentimes you need a lot more support and a lot more help from anywhere from mentors to other people who can help you be unblocked from a technical standpoint or just people you would want to get feedback from. What if you're interested in making this ready for your friends or family to use or somebody else on the Internet to just play with it? What are some of these things you would rather ensure before it gets into the hands of general audience? Those things, you don't really get to figure this out. So what we wanted to do was offer a way for us to play with that as a narrative and see if we can solve that and offer this as an online event. Of course, the recent events around the world did push us into making this decision faster.
00:15:43.926 - 00:16:42.286, Speaker A: So with all of that, I am extremely excited to say that today is the official kickoff of Hackmoney and I'm super excited to have all of you here listening to me from all these places in the world. So the most obvious thing that I want to address is Hackmoney is specific to DeFi. It is a DeFi only event. And compared to the other events we've done, they've been very broad in terms of what you can work on. And the reason was as we were learning about how we can actually make this efficient for the experience for a developer, but also the general experience for how we actually make this really cool and insightful and just productive for our mentors and our sponsors and you hackers, we wanted to just double down. Things that we see are clearly working really well. And as we looked at the hundreds of projects we've seen at all the other events, we saw that DeFi was an obvious thing that everybody was super excited about.
00:16:42.286 - 00:17:35.150, Speaker A: And the number of projects that leveraged DeFi Primitives kept on growing. So not only was this growing the fastest, we also found this to be like the most amazing community that is there to help everybody out and help each other learn and grow and build cool things off of each other's work. And we get to then also focus on the experience exclusively and make sure that everybody in this space, particularly DeFi, is there to help you achieve your projects and get them to that next level. And also, let's face it, money. Legos are super cool and I just want to see all the cool stuff that all of you have mentioned in your applications. So four weeks ago, we announced this whole event and the response we got was incredible. As of this morning, there are 300 hackers, a little over 300 actually, that have registered and staked and confirmed their participation in this event.
00:17:35.150 - 00:18:14.814, Speaker A: They've indicated on their dashboards that there's going to be over 60 projects. They're going to be working on more. So rolling in as people decide what they want to do. We have people from a little bit over 45 countries, I feel like there's a lot of them on this call right now, and people from 15 different time zones. So of course the next four weeks are going to be fun in us coordinating a lot of the events we have planned for you. But I am super grateful that all of you are able to join us on this call and are excited to spend your evenings and weekends and nights and mornings with us here. These are some of the countries that hackers are participating from.
00:18:14.814 - 00:19:26.530, Speaker A: I saw a lot of the city names in the chat here on the Zoom Call, and I'm happy to say that we have people from every continent participating at this event. And that just makes me super excited. Because not only do we just prove that this truly is a global phenomena, we also get to make things that are super interesting to all of us and bring in all these diverse perspectives from everybody across the world and use each other's work and ideas and ideologies to make something that others would also love to. And yes, I know that Antarctica is not here yet, but we can go into the whole legal lease for if that's official continent in a country that has permanent residency or not. So don't give me too much black on Antarctica. So one thing I realized was that two of the slides just got missing and I'm going to have to make this up as we go along. So, essentially, Hackmoney is an ETH Global event, and ETH Global, if you're not familiar, is an organization that runs events across the world.
00:19:26.530 - 00:20:01.950, Speaker A: And the goal for us is to bring in more Web Three developers into this ecosystem. We've done 15 events so far. Hack Money will be our 16th event and are also our first online event. And over the past two and a half years, we've had people, or over 10,000 people, apply to Hack at these events. We've seen over 1100 projects come out of these events, and we've had people from over 80 countries now physically present at one of our events. That, to us, is amazing. Of course, there are so many other trade offs when you're doing something in person because you are physically and fundamentally limited by geography.
00:20:01.950 - 00:21:27.926, Speaker A: But this is what's exciting about doing this thing online. So some of the cool things we've seen come out of well, actually, one thing I forgot to mention was as we kind of did the D Five events, we saw that not only were we able to get 300 of you to participate in RSVP, we also got all these amazing companies to be part of the mentors and sponsors for this event. And all of them are here, some of them are on this call, everybody else is definitely on Discord to support you and actually help you understand and build stuff on DeFi. And this is kind of what makes it super interesting, because not only do you have access to all these D Five projects, and being able to talk to the engineers, the developers, the founders there, to understand their perspectives, and how you can actually build something that scales. But you also have access to over 21 of these mentors who are here to help you anywhere from getting technical feedback to understanding what you should do in terms of getting advice on how do you think about scaling your project, to thinking about marketing and distribution, to even investing. If you want to take this to the next level, and we're super excited to sort of offer that, and we're adding a lot more people to be able to help out as mentors and just be there to support you in any form. And this is why we get super excited.
00:21:27.926 - 00:22:30.510, Speaker A: So this is my correction to the Slide eve Global. You already know what that is because I just talked about that. But we've done all these events, and this is why we get super excited for hack money, because over the 1100 projects we've seen so far, some of the cool ones that you think about are projects like Set Protocol, One Inch Exchange, Ethereum CryptoKitties, and even the Origins of Gitcoin. All these come from eGlobal events, and we've seen just the amazing things that they've been able to accomplish in the place they have in our community. But imagine what would come out if you had 30 days instead of two. And after reviewing every single application for this event and hearing about all the things you're excited to build about, I can comfortably say that I am about to be blown away by everything we'll see in about a month. And I can't wait to see all these projects and use some of them directly on a day to day basis, because everything you're all working on is extremely exciting.
00:22:30.510 - 00:23:25.706, Speaker A: So we have 45 minutes for this call. I wanted to make sure that we had an hour. So what I want to do actually, is just give you a high level overview of what the next 45 minutes will look like. We want to definitely cover how this hackline is going to work over the next 30 days as you kind of build and start hacking. We want to address a handful of questions that we've been getting over email and our discord, which is how does teamformation work? What is a check in? How can you get help? Or what are some of the prizes that I can win? And also, it's not just about saying, I'm working on a hackathon, just disappearing, coming back in a month. We actually have a lot of things planned over the course of the next four weeks where we're doing a lot of talks, AMAs panels and workshops, and also just actual casual hangouts where all of us just kind of join in, and anywhere from just talk over voice to collectively watch movies and other things. So I have all of that I want to cover in a few minutes.
00:23:25.706 - 00:24:14.910, Speaker A: But before that, I actually wanted to invite three special people on this call and have them actually talk about their experiences in the world of DeFi and just cover sort of the things that they're excited about. And that's Linda Shea from Scalar Capital and Spencer Noon from DTCC and Austin Griffith from the Ethereum Foundation, where Austin helps a lot with the developer experience, and I have a bunch of questions I want to ask them. I want them to kind of tell us about things they're excited about. And also we'll have the opportunity to ask them questions. So if you have any questions as an attendee, feel free to ask them on the Zoom chat. And we will be able to bring them up here on this call and ask away. So with that, please welcome Linda, Spencer, and Austin to our virtual stage.
00:24:16.710 - 00:24:17.746, Speaker B: Hey, guys.
00:24:17.928 - 00:24:19.380, Speaker C: Hey, how's it going?
00:24:20.630 - 00:24:37.240, Speaker A: Perfect bow tie, Austin. So I have so much stuff I want to talk about. So we're going to have to think about based on the time, how much we have to cover. But I kind of wanted to start off by actually asking all of you what is the last DeFi transaction that you made?
00:24:40.250 - 00:24:40.966, Speaker B: I'll start it.
00:24:40.988 - 00:24:42.746, Speaker D: Off you go.
00:24:42.848 - 00:24:54.750, Speaker B: This is going to be so confusing. Last one I made was converting PSI to ETH and then ETH to die. Basically upgrading my side to die and then compound on Argent wallet.
00:24:59.410 - 00:25:04.558, Speaker D: Does it count if you're moving ETH to die? I definitely was doing that on Local Host earlier, but I'm just going to.
00:25:04.564 - 00:25:05.540, Speaker E: Do it right now.
00:25:06.550 - 00:25:18.660, Speaker D: I'm going to invest 500 die right now in compound, and I'm done with Argent. It was that easy.
00:25:20.950 - 00:25:22.980, Speaker A: I think Spencer is about to top this.
00:25:24.550 - 00:25:30.262, Speaker C: No, I was going to say my last D Five transaction was doing Pull together Pods, which is the newest feature.
00:25:30.326 - 00:25:47.774, Speaker A: That's awesome. Now with that, let's actually start off with some introductions. I'd love to hear a bit more about each of you and just kind of have everybody else watching also know who you are. Sure.
00:25:47.812 - 00:25:48.382, Speaker C: I can start.
00:25:48.436 - 00:25:48.750, Speaker A: So.
00:25:48.820 - 00:26:00.610, Speaker C: I'm Spencer Noon, head of Crypto Investments at DTC Capital. And I also run our network, which is a newsletter. It's a community driven newsletter and we focus on on chain metrics and network.
00:26:04.570 - 00:26:05.442, Speaker A: Linda?
00:26:05.586 - 00:26:27.120, Speaker B: Oh, I'm linda. I'm co founder of a crypto fund called Scalar Capital. Previously, I was a product manager at Coinbase and I'm also an advisor to Zero X. Really big fan of DeFi. We use it and participate at Scalar Capital. And so I'm excited to see what everyone's building.
00:26:27.650 - 00:26:58.710, Speaker A: That's awesome. So we'll start off with something, some high level basic stuff. There's a lot of stuff happening in the economy, and we've seen the traditional markets crash or go up or down. And my question to you is, I guess as you kind of think about or see what's happening in the rest of the world from an economic standpoint, how do you think that affects DeFi and the crypto ecosystem?
00:26:59.530 - 00:27:02.694, Speaker B: Austin, you want to go first and then intro yourself too?
00:27:02.892 - 00:27:32.900, Speaker D: Well, yeah, actually. So I'm going to go back to my introduction because it's going to feed into my answer to this question. Basically, I'm a lowly builder in the space, so I don't know a ton about DeFi, I know about building blocks and putting them together and making code, but I don't know a ton about Geopolitical stances on stablecoins. So I think that I am a builder and thank you everyone, for being on the call, but I'm going to basically yield that first question to someone who knows more about what it actually means.
00:27:37.270 - 00:27:38.766, Speaker B: Do you want to go, Spencer?
00:27:38.958 - 00:27:40.742, Speaker C: Sure, I can take it. Can everyone hear me?
00:27:40.796 - 00:27:41.302, Speaker B: Okay?
00:27:41.436 - 00:28:33.266, Speaker C: I heard there was some microphone issues. Awesome. So I think it's an interesting time, right, in DeFi and traditional finance and the markets, we're kind of moving from this period of stability to volatility. And so when you think about what that means for DeFi, a lot of the apps that we've had have been very simple, kind of put your stable coins into a money market fund or something like that and generate some interest. And it's enough interest because it's five or six or 7% where that's meaningful? And now what happens when interest rates are so low that I'm making 0.5% on an annualized basis? It's really, really nothing. And so I think founders and entrepreneurs need to think more about what are the different use cases that will work in this paradigm.
00:28:33.266 - 00:29:07.810, Speaker C: And then there's some other things to think about too. I think downside protection is one, right? So you look at companies like Open that have created insurance against your ETH, the price going down, or even I want to take advantage of volatility on the long side and invest in something. I think we'll see a lot more products like that too. But yeah, I think in this time when we really don't know how the next few months and years are going to go, we're going to need to be on our feet to see what actually sticks.
00:29:08.390 - 00:29:46.430, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with all of that. I think it'll be interesting to see the difference between a fiat stablecoin and a decentralized stablecoin and the yields on that. We're already seeing some difference in die rates on Compound and dYdX and part of it could be like regulatory arbitrage, part of it could be just the trading pairs that are offered. So it'll be interesting to see maybe as people are chasing yields, we actually get some non crypto people in to be like, wow, I can actually maybe earn slightly higher yields on these decentralized stablecoins. Of course, that'll bring it down too. But it'll be interesting to see. I think it's really difficult to predict right now.
00:29:46.430 - 00:30:14.040, Speaker B: I think, though, the whole macro news has actually been a really good narrative for crypto. I think just like the Fed, printing historic amounts of money will actually bring more attention to Bitcoin and people are going to start learning more about Ethereum and DeFi through that. So I think that overall, this is a good opportunity for crypto to build really cool things that are going to reach non crypto people as well.
00:30:15.130 - 00:30:49.170, Speaker A: That's awesome. I guess maybe, Spencer, you kind of touched on this a little bit, but as we kind of look at kind of the obvious differentiator that DeFi right now has, which is a high yield, but a lot of that is still leveraged on stablecoins. And I think as of right now, we're nearing about 9 billion of stablecoin Issuance and a lot of them are fiat backed. Do you think that sort of shocks the whole DeFi stablecoin ecosystem or actually something that Linda touched on? But what other use cases can we actually have for these stablecoins if yield is not the end goal?
00:30:50.470 - 00:31:43.380, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's a great question. I think it's tough to know exactly how much if there's supply that gets flooded of stablecoins into the space in crypto, how much does that come over to DeFi? We really don't know the answer. I think it'll be interesting to see. There are other use cases for stablecoins. Right, remittances I think there's been a couple of good articles written on how stablecoins could provide an alternative or an alternative to the existing infrastructure for Euro dollars. So these are just foreign entities who need access to USD and they're using Tether or they're using USDC and something like so who knows? But I do think one of the things that we do know is that the rails of these stablecoins, they're very seamless and they're very easy to use.
00:31:45.910 - 00:32:34.014, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that adding stablecoins to a lot of different projects in the space that have historically had ETH will actually make it a lot easier to use. And I think Auger V two is a really great example of that. So it's a lot harder to bet using ETH than it is just a stable coin, because now you're being exposed to volatility of ETH price. So I think people start adding stablecoins into these projects and it'll allow for a wider user base. So I think we're only going to see a larger trend of that. And then I just think stablecoins at 9 billion now is just actually so small compared to what it's going to be. Which is crazy because I think early days you had all these kind of startups creating their stablecoins and then you had larger companies like Coinbase and Circle creating their stablecoins.
00:32:34.014 - 00:32:53.626, Speaker B: And I think that we're going to have a trend of banks directly issuing stablecoins because the banks are taking on that risk anyways. And then you're going to see the governments themselves issue the stablecoins. And I think it's just going to basically so many transactions and stablecoins, which will be pretty crazy to see, if.
00:32:53.648 - 00:32:57.846, Speaker A: You were to make a prediction. Linda, when do you think we see government backed stablecoins?
00:32:58.038 - 00:33:16.990, Speaker B: Oh, this I mean, I don't know to the extent of how much it's used, but I think there's going to be some. I mean, whether it's China's digital currency or just like some announcement of that, there's going to be serious efforts put into a digital currency.
00:33:18.050 - 00:34:06.350, Speaker A: That's awesome. No, I definitely was not aware of direct efforts going on in this thing, but that is way sooner than all of us thought, or at least I thought. That's great. So I want to actually kind of ask each of you, but maybe starting with Austin DeFi and just crypto specifically is very much of a good sort of mix of composability where you get to kind of put things together in different forms and permutations and combinations, kind of come up with interesting outcomes. So as a developer, kind of why is that exciting and sort of like what kind of do you think the potential becomes compared to the traditional world where that may not be the case as much? Would love to kind of have all of you compare to contrast some of that, but especially I guess from the developer.
00:34:08.390 - 00:34:55.082, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's like it's a mouthful of a word, but permissionless extensibility, right? That to me is the exciting part for a developer. The fact that everything's open source and everything's on chain and I can go talk to your contract, I can extend your token without having any permission from you. Right. Like a mediocre developer in a weekend can write a token that wraps another token but has a new mechanic in it. That's something that no one has ever thought of before. And I think that's the really interesting, really exciting thing that we're seeing. I think really quick we should just real fast just jam through what are the primitives, right? So you can basically lock up ETH in a loan and get die and that keeps a stable token, like over collateralization gives you a stable coin.
00:34:55.082 - 00:35:24.934, Speaker D: Then you can use that stable coin and you can lend it and earn something on that. Right. Or you can put the ETH and the stablecoin into a pool and you can make money on the liquidity as it moves. Right. Or you could basically now it's like insurance, right? I was talking with a partner from Open about how that basically you can say, if I own this token, then I can always turn in my ETH at a certain amount. So insurance is like this new kind of primitive also. So I think that kind of like lays out the primitives.
00:35:24.934 - 00:35:53.300, Speaker D: I missed one. Like everyone let me know. But I think knowing that we have these building blocks already and then we can add new blocks to it and anyone in a weekend or a 30 day period, hint, hint, hint, can put together something that basically every single developer and user in the space has the ability to access overnight. So I'm just really excited about what's going to come out of this and already what we're seeing coming out of this. I'll pass it on though.
00:35:56.180 - 00:35:57.616, Speaker C: Linda, you want to go?
00:35:57.798 - 00:36:39.730, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. I'm also very excited by that. I think an area that I've been thinking a lot about Is and Brian Flyn talks about this a lot, but gaming plus DeFi and I think it's really cool because you can maybe get people to understand finance a lot more, get them to play it a lot more and be interested in finance by gamifying things. And then on the flip side, maybe create some really interesting economics in a game to get people to get really excited by it. So I think that there's a lot of cool things that you can plug in together that aren't just like the money Legos. So, yeah, I'd love to see if anybody creates anything like gaming and DeFi related, please reach out to me.
00:36:40.260 - 00:37:06.090, Speaker D: That's a really interesting kind of thing to talk about is how as a developer, my skills in economics, my skills in game theory, my skills in so many other different areas have to be upgraded to be able to participate in the system. Which is a lot of fun because we have to learn a ton to be able to this lowly developer talking geopolitical economics, I don't know any of that stuff, but it's really exciting to be part of this.
00:37:11.820 - 00:37:59.290, Speaker A: I know we've kind of seen already a lot of this answered on this thing, but I'll try to spin this thing slightly differently. Do you see sort of any common mistakes as people are working on? DFI a lot of the things here are definitely different than the traditional sense because some of them are just not possible if you are in the Web two world. And some of these things are things that we don't really know the second order effects for, because of composability or because everything is super connected with each other. But maybe just like a light comment from Spencer and Linda on this and maybe one from a technical standpoint. Austin, what do you think are some common, either misconceptions or common mistakes that you see developers make as they kind of look into playing with money, so to speak?
00:37:59.980 - 00:38:36.980, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll start. So I think that a lot of developers, we have all these different primitives that you guys talked about and there's this natural kind of feeling that why don't I just take them all and remix them in a way that's pretty obvious, right? And the more that I've seen projects like that, it's the ones that do. They obviously take those primitives, but they use them in really clever ways. I mean, awesome. We were talking about this yesterday. I think pool together is the perfect example. Anyone can create together in a relatively short period of time, right? But it took an extra jump to be able to do that.
00:38:36.980 - 00:39:28.148, Speaker C: And yeah, I think there are other examples of that too. In terms of other mistakes. I don't know if this is a mistake per se, but I would love to see more companies or more developers build things that actually capture fees because we've all kind of struggled with this nebulous question, which is how do you value crypto networks? What is worth investing in? And I think for me as an investor, I spent a lot of time thinking about that question and now we have some ways, some traditional methodologies to be able to do that. So you look at a website like Token Terminal, it's a great kind of MVP that shows all the different D Five protocols and what's their annualized fees. And it doesn't matter what you think about is ETH money, is it not? Or whatever. Uniswap is doing about $10 million in fees on an annualized basis. That's amazing.
00:39:28.148 - 00:39:32.410, Speaker C: No one can take that away from them. And so I'd love to see more of that.
00:39:33.740 - 00:40:12.850, Speaker B: Yeah, just to add on to that, I think it's really interesting because we're seeing more and more of these projects start adding protocol fees or having discussions around that. And I think at a certain level, I don't think anybody would really fork the contract and get serious momentum around it. So you also have to have a fine balance between what are the fees and extremely high level, you're too rent seeking and people might fork it, but there's got to be a sweet spot where it's actually a really great fee for the protocol, but then no one's actually going to fork it and create something else. So it'll be interesting to see that.
00:40:13.380 - 00:41:10.950, Speaker A: I did have a question about business model, so we can kind of dig into that a little bit more. But I know we kind of seen obviously, the potential of what you can do with this thing and kind of how you can combine these things to come up with new products. But we've also seen a lot of the other side of that story, which is hacks things gone wrong or just the fact that this is irreversible as a transaction. In most cases, there are consequences of not having the best guarantees around safety of your funds or the experience. How should people be thinking about the safety of funds as they kind of launch their products? Whether this is a hackathon or just projects in general trying to become companies, how should people trade off or what do you think people should do as they think about having people obviously play with the tools but then also make sure that they're not always entirely in the testing phase? Is there a right balance for that as a developer or an investor or general strategies around that?
00:41:12.520 - 00:41:41.696, Speaker D: I think the tooling, like we can start at the very developer level. I think the tooling is getting a lot better for this too. We're seeing new tools that are making it easier and easier for us to debug these kind of things. And it's less of a black box now, so I think that's a plus. We're seeing the ecosystem as a whole kind of build up more and we're seeing more auditing practices. And a lot of that. I think that one mistake that we should make on the other side is the safety thing is really important for a million dollars.
00:41:41.696 - 00:42:20.780, Speaker D: Right. But it's simple, solidity code and you as a developer get in there and break stuff. Definitely don't be afraid of losing money when it's like a $10 or $20 even on a test net. Like, get in there and break stuff for sure. But then on the other level, yes, we need much more due diligence. We shouldn't just be cloning projects and putting new tokens in them and stuff like that. So you have to be very clear with your entire stack and understanding how everything works and making sure it's fully audited and putting bounties up and putting small amounts of money into it and trying it at first before you get to that stage of kaboom.
00:42:22.080 - 00:42:26.588, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought Future Swap was actually a good example of this. I mean, they got a lot of.
00:42:26.674 - 00:42:29.570, Speaker A: Can you describe how they did that or what they did?
00:42:30.500 - 00:43:06.350, Speaker B: So originally they released an alpha and they had a really good amount of trade volume on there and liquidity, like 1 million in liquidity and 13 million in trade volume. And that was like past, I think, the interest level for an alpha. And so they actually are ending their alpha early to kind of minimize the amount of risk because they made it really clear like, this is an alpha, please be really careful. And I think I don't know, users don't necessarily always respond to that and so they preemptively shut that down early. And so I think having controls like that at the very early stages is a really good idea.
00:43:08.880 - 00:44:05.150, Speaker A: No, that's great. I think the kind of common thing we've seen everybody do is have threshold based testing. So just the way ceilings work on Maker, like, you don't want to issue things that you can't handle properly. And we've seen that approach work, but there's so much more room to play around and see how we can experiment, whether that's adding the ability to kind of reverse some of these transactions or buffer them or just have people see how this would work before they actually put in real money. And I think some of the examples, including Creature Swap, is a great way to test that out. What are some of these creative like anywhere from ideas to concepts to pitches. You've seen Linda and Spencer that kind of fall into this fringes of this is what now is possible with DeFi or things that you would like to see? Are there some examples you can give us that may not be mainstream yet, but you totally see something working out here?
00:44:06.080 - 00:44:57.120, Speaker C: Well, I mean, Linda talked a little bit about gaming and I think that's a great category to focus and maybe if I would just take a step back right. We've had with DeFi today a lot of the legacy crypto assets that folks are engaging with. So ETH and dai, et cetera. But what about kind of bringing financialization to other types of assets and maybe it's in game assets, it could be NFT art. I think that's one that's really cool. And we've seen actually pretty decent volumes on websites like Super Rare and OpenSea where people actually care about this. So if you take things like collateralized, loans, lending, borrowing, all that stuff and instead use instead of ETH, you're using, I don't know, an NFT that could be really cool.
00:44:57.120 - 00:45:00.450, Speaker C: And I don't think we've seen a ton of use cases about that.
00:45:03.380 - 00:45:51.296, Speaker B: Like adding on to the art piece. I think async art is doing some really cool stuff. I've talked to you about it, Kartik. Having programmable art is just such an insanely cool concept and being able to pull on chain data and have that affect how your art actually looks is fascinating to me. And I think there's so many interesting possibilities that are so unique to crypto and then, so an area that I would really like to see is just more of the reputation identity aspect of DeFi. I know that's an extremely difficult topic, but maybe this tack on being longer, someone can actually spend more time digging into this. Just like how we have such high requirements for collateral and this isn't actually scalable and a lot of people aren't able to actually participate in the system because of this.
00:45:51.296 - 00:46:17.160, Speaker B: And so being able to build up a reputation over time, whether that be like people vouching for you or that's providing your NFT in the collateral, or just like building up a reputation by taking out loans and maybe over time you get lower interest rates or something. So I would love to see more people tackling this again, really hard problem, but I'm happy to brainstorm about personal.
00:46:17.230 - 00:46:55.220, Speaker D: Tokens or person tokens or the me tokens and stuff like that. I think that's a really exciting new kind of innovation that's happened. And not just like I'm tokenizing my time, but the tools that will come with that once my time is tokenized and there's a market for it and maybe there's a staking to do list that if it reaches some critical commitment, then that person starts working on that thing and then there's money streaming to them. There's so many possibilities that we can do with this code and with these primitives that who knows what's going to happen when you apply a market to something that hasn't traditionally had a market applied to it.
00:46:55.370 - 00:47:31.836, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think with some of the personal token examples, we're dealing with a lot of trust with people. So I'm going to commit that. I'll give you an hour of my time and you kind of just have to take me at my word. And I know that we have this hesitancy with things like that in the space, but because it's such a low order value we're not talking about billions of dollars here. It's okay to trust people sometimes. And I think we should experiment with those fringe use cases because I personally think they could just spawn some really creative ideas.
00:47:32.028 - 00:48:20.460, Speaker A: Yeah, at best you can just buy an insurance policy against somebody's time in case to cancel. That is, I think, Austin, you put it really well. I think the best answer to kind of track this is that you actually are applying markets to anything you can think of and addie. That is a very eye opening and exciting concept because we've traditionally never had either the tools or the capability of doing so. And being able to say that something that is worth a cent or a dollar is now the same as if it was a trillion is the exact same economics or the behavior, and the system understands that or is independent of that. It's just a very fascinating kind of technical primitive that we just never have been able to deal with because the granularity has never been able to scale consistently. And that, to me, is the most exciting part when I look at it as a developer.
00:48:20.460 - 00:48:51.610, Speaker A: So I don't have a lot of questions. I know we're getting a lot of stuff from the audience. I want to start asking that if anybody on the attendee side has any questions, please feel to type them in the chat and I'll bring them up here. But the one thing I want to ask you here before we kind of move into only questions is Spencer, you kind of touched on this thing a little bit, but other than just fees, have you seen any other creative sort of business models for these projects to sustain themselves or just things that were just not possible in the non D Five world.
00:48:55.020 - 00:49:04.204, Speaker C: Well, I think in terms of business models, when you really break it down to their core primitives, they do end up mirroring what we have in the real world.
00:49:04.242 - 00:49:04.444, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:04.482 - 00:49:37.210, Speaker C: And so there is that kind of element of value capture. So a crypto native example of that I think would be burning. Right. Not a lot of people are burning assets in the real world, but maybe also things like aggregation. Right. If we talk about the unique things that you can do with composable D Five primitives, that's one that I think more people should spend some time on. You obviously have one Inch and some of the Dex aggregators, but there are other use cases for DeFi that we could probably aggregate as well.
00:49:44.380 - 00:50:14.630, Speaker A: Do you see what you just said at ODS with sort of or not ODS, but do you think that actually is the only way you can actually have a system that cannot be easily forked because a lot of that is about the liquidity effects or just the aggregation part of this, where things become either successful or more efficient. I don't really have a question, but I'm actually just curious, have you kind of thought about it from that perspective of how does forking change? If you have a different model here or do you think that is the only way you can converge on some of them being popular as services?
00:50:15.960 - 00:50:17.940, Speaker C: Could you expand on that maybe a little bit more?
00:50:18.010 - 00:50:19.830, Speaker A: I don't really know what I'm trying to ask.
00:50:20.840 - 00:50:26.120, Speaker D: It has to be like a huge question. If you could just fork.
00:50:26.620 - 00:51:09.190, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think everyone has this idea and framework in their mind that these are all open source protocols and so if they are rent seeking in a way that users don't like, they're just going to be forked. And if someone has a competing business then it's zero sum. And I think in practice it hasn't really played out that way. Although we do see with companies like Deforce take code from other companies and start using it and I think who knows what happens. It really is going to depend on a case by case basis. But I don't think that forking is this crazy threat that a lot of people make it out to be.
00:51:10.520 - 00:51:40.530, Speaker A: No, I agree, even though I have no idea what I asked. No, that's great. So we're getting a bunch of questions. I think one comment I see is if forking is a feature, but it doesn't mean just because you have that feature you can claim it. So I have a couple of questions I want to ask. But before we move into just the questions part, I want to end this off by asking each of you just kind of what are some of the things that make you super optimistic about this space and specifically the future of DeFi and kind of what you're excited about over the next few months to few years.
00:51:42.340 - 00:52:47.940, Speaker D: I said this yesterday, and I think that taking a word from you, Kartik, when you were interviewing Vitalik and Joe, you said compounding pace. And I think that phrase, that phrase compounding pace, like we have compounding interest and a lot of other stuff in DeFi, but the fact that our development space is moving at a compounding pace and each time we have one of these hackathons, we get new tools, we get new primitives, we get new products. I think that we're reaching an inflection point now specifically with tooling where our tooling is now built with developer experience in mind. Instead of building a tool to get a job done, we're building tools to make it great to use and to build on. And I think that we're at a specific point right now where we're going to see a lot of tools and a lot more of these primitives come out. And just anyone with a free weekend or 30 days is going to be able to sit down and just apply force to this in a way that we don't even understand yet. And I'm really excited about that just the tooling, the ecosystem, the primitives, and just that Compounding pace pushing us forward faster and faster.
00:52:48.600 - 00:52:53.530, Speaker A: No, that's right. I want to give Spencer Linda a chance.
00:52:59.180 - 00:53:31.684, Speaker B: On your screen. It's the other way for me, but there we go. I'm really excited by just like, the entrepreneurs building the space. I'm constantly meeting with just brilliant people who specifically chose to spend their time building in DeFi, which is a really great sign to me. And then I also spend a lot of my time talking to institutional investors about crypto. And I've been trying to talk to them more about DeFi and explaining it to them. And a lot of them, once you get past explaining how Maker works, which takes some time, they actually are like, wow, this is actually really cool.
00:53:31.684 - 00:54:02.190, Speaker B: This is totally just operating on its own and there's no centralized company that's controlling this or government. And they start understanding this and thinking that it's really interesting. So I think over time, as we build more and more products that might be familiar to non crypto people, I think we're going to widen the audience of who's actually participating this and of course, abstracting away the DeFi components of it. So I'm just really excited because I think the entire user base is going to grow a lot over the next few years.
00:54:03.120 - 00:55:07.872, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say that I'm most excited about just all of these new protocols or existing networks, actually, that are decentralizing and giving ownership to their communities and having these be kind of community owned and operated networks. We have the opportunity to do this on a really large scale that's never been done before. And I think you look at companies like Compound, they're really blazing a trail in terms of how companies in the future are going to let their users actually be the owners. And so I'm excited about that. And then in terms of things I'm optimistic for, I would echo some of the things Linda talked about. We're kind of reaching this inflection point where we have these interesting macro conditions and some early use cases of early signs of product market fit. I would say the Fiat stablecoins being issued at an alarming pace recently is a good signal there.
00:55:07.872 - 00:55:38.316, Speaker C: And when you think about developers, the rate of new developers entering the space is actually, we're not hockey stick. There's not 1000 more than there were a year ago. And so you've all got just an incredible opportunity to take advantage of these primitives. Everything is getting battle tested and ready. We have new use cases. It's almost the perfect storm to be a developer and an entrepreneur in this space. So I'm really excited to see what happens over the next year.
00:55:38.498 - 00:56:10.596, Speaker A: No. That is so good. All three of you. That's so well put. I think Kendler takeaways from this answer is that abstraction is not a bad thing. I don't have to worry about TCP and IP right now in web two, and we will eventually get to a world where I can just assume things work the way they're supposed to and not worry about the lower level of that stack. If I were to maybe incorrectly summarize Linda and Spencer's comment, we're getting to the point where we don't get called crazy after we describe how something works by everybody else.
00:56:10.596 - 00:56:18.148, Speaker A: So the more that happens, the more we get closer to consumer adoption. And that is also wonderful when you're.
00:56:18.164 - 00:56:24.952, Speaker D: Like the Charlie meme, when you're putting all the stickers on the board and everything makes you and no one else.
00:56:25.086 - 00:56:30.056, Speaker A: We've convinced them what Maker is, just have them understand what a flashlight is and we should be golden.
00:56:30.088 - 00:56:30.990, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:56:32.640 - 00:56:43.728, Speaker A: So one last question I have for the audience and then we'll move on to the rest of the logistics for this event is, I guess, what kind of role do you think DAOs can play in DeFi? Whoever wants to take that, I want.
00:56:43.734 - 00:57:03.610, Speaker D: To tap on that. Just a second. The Dow part, I feel like we've gone too far away from what a Dow was supposed to be like. The A in the Dow meant that it was automated and there were markets that were happening and a lot of Dows I see now aren't very a. So I'm hoping we bring the A back to the Dow, but I'm just going to pass it on from there.
00:57:05.100 - 00:57:36.560, Speaker B: I'm all for experimentation at small scales. I don't think we're at the stage where we can have a Dow be managing large sums of money, but I think that Dows are actually really interesting and I'm glad to see a resurgence of that after the Dow hack. And so, yeah, I think that's really exciting to see. And people taking small pools of money and investing it in different crypto projects has been a popular use case I've seen. So, yeah, I'd love to see more experiments.
00:57:37.460 - 00:57:57.416, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not super excited about the A in Dow, but we're decentralizing capital pools using kind of voting and other crypto mechanisms to deploy money and kind of run a business that's super interesting. And we're obviously going to see more.
00:57:57.438 - 00:58:17.710, Speaker A: Of it soon, perhaps. We'll see a lot of these interesting things we talked about here in a month from our hackers. So obviously all of you will be up to date because you are also on our discord. But I wanted to thank Linda, Austin and Spencer for taking the time today and really appreciate you sharing your thoughts in this space. Thank you so much.
00:58:18.160 - 00:58:30.050, Speaker D: Thanks for having us. Happy Friday. There's so many good names in this chat, too. So many people that know more about DeFi building than I do. It's great to have everybody here.
00:58:31.540 - 00:59:06.220, Speaker A: I'm extremely excited. So what I'll do is I'm going to go back to the PowerPoint and we'll just cover some of the logistics stuff and I have a handful of information that I want to relay about our sponsors and our prizes. So we'll go into that and get this back on track. So back to hack money. We have an amazing set of sponsors that are here to help you make this the best four weeks for you to make your project come back to life. Not back, just come to life. And I want to thank everybody here that kind of made this possible.
00:59:06.220 - 00:59:47.260, Speaker A: A lot of them are here spending all their time and hours to make sure that you're successful. And with that, I'd like to thank each and every one of them. And that's ave compound uniswap ethereum foundation uma ENS chainlink balancer. Saya p tokens opengsn pull together portis and are all of them are on our discord and they're there to help you. And you can message them and get some help if you're stuck on anywhere from understanding how they work to some SDK or code related changes questions. And they're also going to be offering prizes. And I want to offer a few of them to kind of share a few thoughts about who they are and what they're doing.
00:59:47.260 - 01:00:02.160, Speaker A: And we're going to have a quick few words from three of our sponsors starting off with Ave. And Stani from Ave just has a short video for us to watch and I hope you get to hear what Ave has to say.
01:00:02.310 - 01:00:48.136, Speaker E: Hi everyone. My name is Stani, I'm from Ave. Ave is a decentralized money market where you can deposit different kinds of assets and earn and also you can borrow these assets against a collateral. Ave is also pretty well known from Flash loans where you can borrow liquidity without any collateral as much as there's reserves in the protocol. Ave is quite big protocol at the moment. Pretty much one of the known DeFi protocols out there for lending and borrowing. And one of the interesting things about Aave is that we're trying to embrace a lot of composability and innovation around the ecosystem.
01:00:48.136 - 01:02:06.036, Speaker E: And not just the Aave ecosystem, but ethereum and DeFi ecosystem. Now this is very interesting hackathon because it's basically focused on DeFi hacking and it's more longer than the previous hackathons that we have been participating and sponsoring and mentoring in the It global community. So in this particular hackathon we are basically looking like how well you can innovate and how finished product you can actually build within the time span that you have. There's plenty of time, but also good to know that time goes quickly. So my advice for everyone is that get a plan set up and start just building. And one of the things we are kind of encouraging people to do is basically try to apply DeFi into something that might help anyone, maybe in real life, maybe some kind of a way to provide price stability, for example for farmers or any other kind of application. And second thing, we're trying to embrace a lot is yield hacking which is one of my favorite topics and I personally like to practice it's.
01:02:06.036 - 01:02:55.380, Speaker E: Basically trying to get more yield. As we all know, liquidity is the network effect of DeFi and to get more liquidity you basically need to get more yield for the depositors or your users. So that's like one of the things we are looking for here. We have different kind of prices here. So basically there is up to 5000 Adai for grabs for the most coolest, innovative and basically inspiring hacks that you can actually build. And especially like if you do very cool things, it doesn't have to be complex but something really cool that involves other projects or is very beneficial to the whole ecosystem that will be pretty dope. And also part of the hack money is I think making money more secure.
01:02:55.380 - 01:03:56.092, Speaker E: So if you are trying to hack in a way that you are improving the whole ecosystem or basically showing a new way to actually make the ecosystem more secure, that's very appreciated and definitely will get extra highlight from us. Besides the adi prices that we have, we also have a backpack that we're giving out and we'll send you whichever time zone you are. So this is like an official Ave hackback and it has a USB charger and also we're giving up Avisox. Not this one, this is used one. But basically if you hack on Ava you will get your very own Avisox and this is a pretty cool model actually. That being said, I wish you all good luck, have very fun and try to come up with cool things. And if you are stuck or something, don't mind try to ask help.
01:03:56.092 - 01:04:12.450, Speaker E: There's plenty of people here around and everyone is pretty much reachable. We're in Europe time zone but we'll try to stay awake whenever serving as many time zones as we actually can. Thank you all and have a pleasant time.
01:04:14.180 - 01:04:37.560, Speaker A: Thank you stani from Ave and just to kind of summarize, Ave is awarding 5000 Adai in prizes where you get 2500 in Adai for the first place and 1000 501,000 for second and third place respectively. Next up I want to actually call up Adam from Compound and they'll cover Compound sort of presence at this event and all the prizes that Compound is offering.
01:04:42.680 - 01:05:08.792, Speaker F: Hi everyone, I'm Adam, the developer relations lead at Compound. I'm really excited to see what you all build in the hackmoney DeFi hackathon. Compound will have two bounties with prizes of cUSDC. You'll also get to hear from us in a DeFi panel where we'll discuss some of the challenges in DeFi. Date for that is TBD. Before I go over the hackathon bounties, I'll tell you a little about Compound. Compound is an autonomous interest rate protocol made of ethereum smart contracts.
01:05:08.792 - 01:05:45.572, Speaker F: The protocol is made for developers that are building DFI applications. Each of these assets are supported by the protocol. Users can supply or borrow any of these assets using solidity Smart Contracts or a Web Three library like Web Three JS. When applications supply an asset to the compound protocol, they begin earning a variable interest income instantly. Interest accrues every ethereum block, which is about every 15 seconds, and users can withdraw their principal plus interest at any time. In addition to supplying, users can also borrow assets from the protocol. For example, if a user supplies $100 worth of ETH, they can then borrow up to 74 USDC.
01:05:45.572 - 01:06:19.888, Speaker F: This works for any asset combination based on the posted collateral factors. Check out the compound homepage to see several applications that have integrated the protocol. We also have thorough Smart Contract documentation, rest API documentation, and Developer Quickstart guides to get moving fast and easy. There are two compound bounties up for grabs in the hackmoney hackathon. The first is for the most creative use of the compound protocol's community Governance Smart Contracts. Build an application SDK or API that has a practical use of comp and governor. The price for this bounty is $1,000 of cUSDC.
01:06:19.888 - 01:06:48.520, Speaker F: Check out the Quickstart Guide for governance, which includes code examples at Compound Finance docs. Governance is live on Mainnet and Robsten. The second bounty is for the most creative use of protocol borrowing. Build an application SDK or API that uses the C Token borrow function. The project's code must use at least one C Token Contracts borrow method. The price for this bounty is $1,000 of cUSDC. Contracts for borrowing are live on all testnets and mainnet.
01:06:48.520 - 01:07:01.330, Speaker F: We'll be holding office hours at 11:30 a.m. Pacific time every Friday during the hackathon. You can also ask questions in the Discord Channel. Be sure to at Adam B. Good luck to all the builders and I'll see you soon.
01:07:02.420 - 01:07:33.790, Speaker A: Thank you Adam. So, as Adam mentioned, compound will be doing two prizes at a total of 2000 C USDC, where 1000 of it will be for the best hack on compound leveraging borrowing. And the second prize for 1000 C USDC will be for the best hack that leverages compound governance. And then lastly, I want to actually invite Noah from Uniswap to share a few thoughts on why they're excited about Hack Money and the prizes that Uniswap is hosting for this event.
01:07:35.040 - 01:07:59.648, Speaker G: Hey, hack money. Noah from uniswap here. Coming to you from Quarantine in New York City. We're really excited to be sponsoring this event. It's going to be a super fun, productive 30 days. And as in a bit of an incentive to builders, we're going to be offering 5000 die of bounties to build on top of Uniswap V Two. The prizes are going to be divided into 1st, second and third place, offering 3001 505 hundred die.
01:07:59.648 - 01:08:25.340, Speaker G: And we're looking for projects that build on top of the Unisoft V Two testnet release, which includes decentralized Oracles ERC, 20 pairs, flash swaps, and a lot more really exciting features. All the details on Unisoft V Two can be found on Uniswap.org and we're also going to be in the discord throughout the event. So feel free to pop in, ask us questions and we're going to be there to help you through. We can't wait to see what you build and good luck.
01:08:26.880 - 01:09:57.720, Speaker A: Thanks noah we have $5,000 of die in prizes from Uniswap where 3000 of the prize money will go to the best hack that leverages Uniswap V Two. And then they'll have two additional prizes of 1505 hundred die for second and third place for also a hack that leverages Uniswap V Two. So these were some of just our key sponsors we wanted to highlight, but there's a few more other prizes by other companies that are available to all of you as hackers and I want to just quickly run over them and then cover the logistics which should take about five more minutes. So Chain Link is also hosting a prize for $5,000 in total where the most compelling projects that use Chain Link in their hacks will get 2000, 501,500 and about $1,000 in Link tokens. Then we have, uma And Uma is awarding $2,000 to two projects that equally sort of leverage the best use of an interesting interface that leverages synthetic tokens and then the best way to incentivize and provide liquidity to other priceless synthetic tokens. Then we have P Tokens and P Tokens will award $4,500 to the top three teams that utilize P Tokens. Then we have ENS and ENS will award $750 total in prizes which is going to be broken down into five $150 in ETH to the top five projects that make a good or interesting use of ENS integrations for their hack.
01:09:57.720 - 01:11:10.784, Speaker A: Then we have Portis powered by shapeshift, and Portis will award $3,000 in ETH or Die. And this will be for a project that best uses the portis SDK to integrate users. Then we have balancer. And Balancer will be awarding $2,000 in prizes where 1300 of it will go to the best project that uses the Balancer protocol and a runner up prize for $700 that also leverages the Balancer protocol. Then we have Opengsn and they will be awarding 1600 in prizes where $1,000 grand prize goes to the best use of GSN to paymaster and three $200 prizes for another meaningful use of the gas station network for a better UX for your hacks. Then we have the Saya network where Saya is going to be awarding 1400 in prizes which will translate into 2500,000 Saya coins to a project that best leverages Skynet integration which is their decentralized CDN service. And of course, even though I ran through all of this thing super quickly, you can go to Hackathon Moneyprises to get details on all of these with instructions on what the nuances are.
01:11:10.784 - 01:12:11.040, Speaker A: And also you can reach out to all of these companies and the team members on the Discord channel on their specific sponsor channel name. So real quick, I want to cover some of. The logistics. Everything here will happen on Discord. We will obviously keep on doing some of these calls online here, which is on Zoom or Discord voice channels, but all hack money channels and all the participants are going to be added to a private group that gives them access to all the hack money specific channels where you get to talk and interact with mentors, you get to talk and interact with sponsors, you get to join a lot of our ad hoc and scheduled events. Like we have a cafe channel that we will just be just doing casual voice chats and we'll have a handful of other kind of fun sort of sectioning there of things we can do over the next month. But the only thing you have to make sure is if you go to Hackathon Money Discord, you will be given a link to join our channels.
01:12:11.040 - 01:12:53.292, Speaker A: And if you have RSVP to stake properly on your dashboard, you get to put in your Discord username. And this will give you access to the private channels on Discord for Hackmoney. If you have any problems in this process or you're stuck or you don't see any of these channels, please reach out to anybody on the global team and we'll be able to help you with getting you access to everything. So some quick questions I wanted to address. The first one is how does this hackathon work? We want to keep this thing super simple. The hackathon begins today, which means as of right now, you can start building your projects and you can start coding with your team or by yourself. There's a maximum limit of five team members per submission.
01:12:53.292 - 01:13:40.530, Speaker A: So if you are working with a team, you can have up to five people and you can declare them on your dashboard. Again, if you have any problems with that, please message us. And the only kind of thing I want to kind of remind everybody is that even though you are totally free to use any open source libraries, you can leverage all of the existing work in this field. It's just that when you are starting a project you should have begun it also in that same timeline. So we can keep this fair to everybody else. So if you think you're in a position where somebody the thing you're working on was something you started a while ago, and you want to just continue working on that, we want to make sure that that is within the criteria of the event. And if you are in that position, please reach out to us so we can kind of just see what's going on for that particular situation.
01:13:40.530 - 01:15:04.504, Speaker A: Another kind of obvious thing I want to point out is what is considered DeFi. We want to keep this slightly high level which is if your hack involves anything in lending, borrowing, trading payments, insurance or any financial services or products, we'll consider your hack to be DeFi and this qualifies for a submission or a prize. And if you have any questions about if your hack may not be considered DeFi by this definition or maybe in the Fringes, please reach out to us and we'll be able to help you with that as well. The most kind of common question we got was what is a check in? And the quick answer on a check in is that we just want to make sure that we're able to help you with getting your project to the end state of it being cool and usable by anybody, including yourselves. And because this is a month long process, we want to make sure that we can have some efforts around making sure that everybody feels connected with everybody else that's participating. So a check in is when one of the ETH Global team members will reach out to you about once a week and just kind of get an update on kind of how things have been going, what do you need help with, or if you're stuck somewhere, we can kind of help you with how to get unblocked. As a result, we'll have on average about four check ins for this course and they can be done either over voice or a call or just directly in text over discord because we have to keep in mind all these time zones.
01:15:04.504 - 01:15:51.432, Speaker A: So as you respond to the check ins and you submit something, you get back your stake. That's the simple sort of process around how check ins work. Some of you have also kind of talked us about I don't have an idea or a team. And if you are on the Hack Money Discord channels, you will see two channels named Hack Ideas and Find a Team where you get to collaborate with others and get feedback or find others who might be interested in working on your idea. But also over the past week we've reached out to a lot of you who've indicated that they're looking for a team and started working on a team finding and matchmaking process. So a lot of you already would have those details figured out. But if you are in a position where you need to find another team member or would like to join a team, please check out the Find a Team discord channel.
01:15:51.432 - 01:16:39.704, Speaker A: And we'll be doing a call next Wednesday where we're connecting everybody else and matching them with the ideas and the team members and the skill sets that they need. And also it's totally okay if you want to hack by yourself. You don't necessarily have to work on a team, but if you are looking to anywhere from Learn or find somebody with complementary skill sets, you have the option to find somebody who is also looking for the same thing. And lastly, we'll cover a handful of stuff around judging and submissions over the next couple of weeks. But judging and your submissions are due on Sunday, May 24, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time, that is 30 days from now and we'll be walking you through a lot of those details and if you have any questions, we're also happy to answer them. And lastly, the next four weeks are going to be eventful from our side.
01:16:39.704 - 01:17:35.870, Speaker A: We're doing a lot of things from our end to make sure that we're offering a very similar experience to the in person events you may have attended and you have an opportunity to talk and interact with everybody that's involved. So this is just a quick highlight of what the next couple of weeks look like, but we'll be posting most of this in a lot more detail on the website and also on Discord. But over the next seven days we'll be hosting a tutorial on Solidity and a dev stack setup using Biddler this Monday. Then I talked about the team formation call if you are looking to join a team. And this coming Friday we have an AMA with Stani from Ave so you get to ask him and the Ave team questions about their company, their process, how flash zones work and anything else you want to know. And then we're also doing office hours with the Audible sponsors. So if you have any questions about using a particular SDK or a protocol, you get to just join their office hours this coming week and just ask them questions live.
01:17:35.870 - 01:18:10.084, Speaker A: And lastly, I want to just make sure that you all pace yourself. We don't want this thing to be exhausting, we don't want this thing to feel like a stressful environment. We want you to have fun. What we're trying to do is also learn as we go through this thing for the first time, what we can do to actually resemble an experience that is similar to what an in person event would be. And we want to actually learn from you too. So if you think something could be done better, if you think something is going really well, we want to hear about that and we want to help improve as we go live. So we want to make sure that you're not stressed as you participate in this thing.
01:18:10.084 - 01:18:51.664, Speaker A: There is not a lot of high expectations from you, we just want you to be successful. So if you're in a position where some things are not working, just let us know and we want to hear you out. And if you have any other questions, you can go to Hackathon Moneyhacker where we have a very big doc that addresses a handful of other things that I haven't talked about in this slide. And obviously you can just ask these questions on Discord and we can answer them for you directly. And lastly, please be respectful, harassment and abuse is not tolerated in any capacity. We kind of put our code of conduct forward as you were filling out and Rcping for this event. But if you have any questions about our event rules and just a code of conduct.
01:18:51.664 - 01:19:15.336, Speaker A: You can go to ETHGlobal Co Rules to learn more about how we actually manage and behave at all our events, whether they're in person or virtual. And with that, I want to wish everybody happy hacking and we'll see you all on Discord. Thank you you so much for taking out the time today. And good morning. Good afternoon, good evening and good night to all of you. Bye.
