00:00:07.050 - 00:00:22.106, Speaker A: Hi everyone, thank you for coming to the Wall Connect workshop. This workshop is just a quick introduction of how to use Wall Connect. I'm first going to do it in English and then if there's any questions, I can also do it in Spanish.
00:00:22.138 - 00:00:30.120, Speaker B: Again, just don't have that boya primero and in less is Itinera de.
00:00:31.130 - 00:01:27.682, Speaker A: So I'm going to start. So Wallet Connect is basically a remote signing secure signing protocol. It allows for easy integration between wallets and DApps by using a QR code. Basically allows you to sign transactions from your wallet without your private keys ever leaving your wallet. The main integration point with Wallet Connect is with this QR code and we provide this. We have a specific application or package, an NPM package that you can use to get started with Wallet Connect. This is the web free model and basically it's just a single provider that you can see here in this image that gives you the ability to either use MetaMask, Wallet Connect Tours coinbase.
00:01:27.682 - 00:02:22.426, Speaker A: It basically allows you to use any web Three provider with just a single NPM package. So if you want to develop a DAP that is enabled with Wallet Connect, you would use this NPM package. Let's just go through it. So this is the package that you need. If you already have a DAP, a website that is already set up, all you need to do is just to add this dependency for enabling the Web Three model. But then let's show you how you can get started with. So this is the easiest way to get started with a QR code pretty much by setting it up with this object.
00:02:22.426 - 00:03:40.130, Speaker A: You can see that in the object we got web3 model and then we pass it in an object parameter and we have the network main net and you need to get an infuria project ID. And just to repeat, this is just for version one of Wallconnect. I should have mentioned this earlier. Version one of Wallconnect is the current most stable version that we have right now and it's the one that you're likely going to have the easiest time with. From our perspective, the bad things about version one is that you can only use for EVM chains and I'll go over V two later. But this is just if you want to have a working DAP, we recommend that you use V one for now. So once you have the web free model initiated, you can do the connect and this will allow the user once they click on the connect button, it will display this four options and then you can just select on the Wall Connect option that will display to you a QR code that you can see like here.
00:03:40.130 - 00:04:26.202, Speaker A: It will display a QR code that you can just scan with a wallet. So while developing a DAP with using this Web Three model, you will get returned this provider object. You'll get given this provider object. This is the traditional provider object that you might find in a lot of DApps that you use. And this provider object gives you basically some events that you need to subscribe to just to get an understanding of when the user changes a wallet or when the user changes the chain. And it's important to follow the event types just to have an idea that what to expect. And so we recommend that you pay attention to the EIP 1193 event types.
00:04:26.202 - 00:04:40.754, Speaker A: And this is what the provider object will be following, the standard that's going to be following. So sometimes you want to quickly test.
00:04:40.792 - 00:04:41.790, Speaker B: With one wallet and then you want.
00:04:41.800 - 00:05:41.254, Speaker A: To disconnect it's like, okay, I want to test it with another wallet. We recommend that you also clear the cache just to make sure that you have a complete clean session because sometimes when you reload the web browser, I mean the website, you're still going to have the previous account saved in the Web Three model. And so it's because it has a browser cache for remembering the previous accounts that it interacted with, but for development purposes it's better to disconnect and also clear the cache provider just to make it easier for you in your license. Don't have like a laggard accounts left over and that might interfere your development process during this hackathon. So this is the same package right at the bottom left you can see all the different types of providers that you can use.
00:05:41.372 - 00:05:42.886, Speaker B: You have wallet connect you have coinbase.
00:05:42.918 - 00:05:51.820, Speaker A: Wallet the web3 object or like MetaMask. There's a big list there you can see.
00:05:55.010 - 00:05:56.334, Speaker B: If anyone wants to scan these.
00:05:56.372 - 00:06:57.786, Speaker A: Docs, now is the time. There's more QR codes at the end. So yeah, so just to repeat, the easiest way to interact with Wallet Connect is to first use this package, this Web Three model package that gives you this interface that you see on the left that has these several options. And with these options you can have a provider object that allows you to either send transactions and request information from the wallet. I recommend that you look at the doc so you can understand the full scope of features that this Web Three model package can give you for developing your DAP. Here's a very good example repo. It's basically a quick start for adapt and it has the Web Three model enabled.
00:06:57.786 - 00:07:52.750, Speaker A: And yeah, this is like the easiest way for you to get started with Wallet Connect. Okay, so everything before here was for version one, and I want to be clear that for this hackathon that version one is the easiest way to get something working for you. Now we have also a version two recently that we just released and we're trying to push it more because it's the direction we want to take the software, our SDK. Right now the version two, Wallet Connect, doesn't have a Web Three model. So you would have to fork one of our existing example repositories that I'll show you later. And the only API that's supported is the sign API. So it's like you can sign for transactions and the wallet can respond.
00:07:52.750 - 00:08:02.434, Speaker A: Right now these are the wallets that support version two. So this is a good list in case you want to be testing them.
00:08:02.472 - 00:08:03.166, Speaker B: Just to have an idea.
00:08:03.208 - 00:08:32.000, Speaker A: Because not all wallets currently support version two of Wallet Connect. We have a website, a react wallet that you can use for testing purposes. So if like, for example, if you find something that's not working for you, you can go to this react wallet walletconnect.com, and that should provide you a very simple browser based wallet that you can then use with Wall Connect version two.
00:08:32.370 - 00:08:33.886, Speaker B: And then on the right side, you.
00:08:33.908 - 00:09:34.430, Speaker A: Have a react app that is using welcome version two at this domain. React app, react app welcome. So just to be clear, just to repeat what I said, these are some wallets that already have integrated Wallet Connect version two. And so it's not all of them, just a specific list. But if you find issues developing with these wallets that's on this list, we also have this react wallet that you can use for version two. Another important thing for version two is that we have a Project ID gateway that you need to use to set up your provider. You'll see in the docs, if you go to in the docs website Wallet Connect, you will see the instructions of how to set up a version two Wall Connect client.
00:09:34.430 - 00:10:07.470, Speaker A: And it's important that you go to set up a Project ID. So you have to get a Project ID before anything else. For version two, this is different to how v one where we don't have a Project ID. On the other hand, version two, we do require a Project ID. And recently we just released this new feature with sign in with Ethereum just recently for our own website. So it's actually quite easy. If you already have a version one of Wallet Connect, you can scan the QR code and you can basically create an account and get a Project ID without email.
00:10:07.470 - 00:10:48.060, Speaker A: Just Ethereum matters, so please try it out. And we're quite excited about just this feature. Yeah, so on the first QR code, the v two websites, this is the repository which has there's a lot of QR codes here. It's probably a bit too crowded for this. This has all the information you need to get started with version two for v two, for version one two, and also the whole repository, our whole organization. Yeah. So that's what I have for now.
00:10:48.060 - 00:12:09.454, Speaker A: Any questions that should answer or any curiosities, go ahead. Yeah, if I try to create this transaction yeah. So just to repeat the question, the question is like, how do you do a request for a transaction the way you do it? So both MetaMask and Wallet Connect would be providing will have this provider object. And if you look at our documentation for the Web Three model, should I have the QR code? My bad. Yeah. So if you look at the documentation for the Web Three model, you have some quick starts on how to request for transactions. And the nice thing about the Web Three model is that it allows you to use both MetaMask and Wallet Connect at the same time.
00:12:09.454 - 00:12:39.672, Speaker A: So it's a user choice, so you can request a transaction. And there's examples on how to do this in the docs that are here. Yeah. So just if you have, like, if you want to test different EVM chains.
00:12:39.816 - 00:12:41.196, Speaker B: You have to pay attention to listen.
00:12:41.218 - 00:13:19.610, Speaker A: To the chain change ID event. So if you want to listen to, for example, Polygon Mumbai or some other EVM for version one of Wallet Connect, like some EVM chains, it's important to pay the wallet initiates that change request. So the wallet sends to the DAP. It's like, okay, I need to change the chain ID, and then the DAP that is using this provider has to listen to these events when the chain changes. So this is just something important if you're using multiple chains for development purposes. The MetaMask mobile wallet is good. The Rainbow wallet is also pretty good.
00:13:19.610 - 00:13:35.396, Speaker A: There's a lot of wallets out there that use wildconnect and just use what's best for you. Yeah. Any more questions and I could try.
00:13:35.418 - 00:13:36.564, Speaker B: To do this again in Spanish.
00:13:36.612 - 00:13:42.410, Speaker A: It's not going to be as good. You got to try in Spanish. Okay.
