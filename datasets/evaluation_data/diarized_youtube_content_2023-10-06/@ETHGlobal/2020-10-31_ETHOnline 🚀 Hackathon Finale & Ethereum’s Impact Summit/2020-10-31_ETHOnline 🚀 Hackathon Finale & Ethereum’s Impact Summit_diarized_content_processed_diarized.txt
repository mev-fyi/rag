00:04:16.690 - 00:04:47.360, Speaker A: Good morning, good afternoon. Good evening, everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global. And it is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our ETH Online finale. So have a lot of things I want to chat about and what I'll do is kind of just jump right into it. We've all been experiencing a lot of interesting things over the past few months.
00:04:47.360 - 00:05:47.294, Speaker A: And for ETH Online, what we decided to do was make this a bit more of an interactive experience for all of us. So we're all on Live Ethonline.org and the thing that kind of we wanted to do was create our own shared experience of a world computer. So we decided to make this platform that makes it easy for all of us to kind of experience this whole event in parallel. And we got some creative things around here where we get to experience different themes, different ways to kind of see what's going on in the event. So you can do anything from checking out the schedule to check out the arguably low gas prices on the top right and also the chat that we have a few hundred people joining in on and chatting and commenting on what's going on with all of us today. So I encourage all of you to kind of sign to the chat so you can give us any questions or comments.
00:05:47.294 - 00:06:39.810, Speaker A: And with that, I want to kick off with today's show. So this is a very interesting and important day for us because this marks as the last event for ETH Global for 2020. And of course, it's been a very interesting year. The goal for ETH Global, our mission is simple. It's to onboard as many developers as we can into the Web Three ecosystem and we want this place in the space to survive. And it has, of course, been a big year. So what I wanted to do was sort of go into what we've done this year as ETH Global and also share what we have plans for as a community and ETH Global, and really sum up what's happened in the world of developers for the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:06:39.810 - 00:07:33.286, Speaker A: And then as all of you were waiting for the demos for our hackathon. So Ethereum is a global community and Ethgobal taps into this community across the world and runs events in person and online for these ecosystems. And we do this primarily by running hackathons and also summits. So this year we kind of kicked off by doing ETH London. We hosted our only in person event this year, earlier in Q One, and we had 200 hackers from London and a lot of neighboring European countries. And we had 50 submissions for this in person weekend hackathon. Then the world changed and in May we ran our first ever online hackathon, Hack Money, which was a DFI focused event.
00:07:33.286 - 00:08:14.590, Speaker A: And for Hack Money we had 354 hackers who collectively worked on 116 D five projects. Then we pivoted. We didn't pivot. We actually collaborated with Protocol Labs and ran our event Hack FS, where we had 466 hackers work on integrating decentralized storage with smart contracts. And Hacker Fest was an amazing success. And we kind of continued our partnership with Oracle Labs for our feature events as well, which kind of got us to ETH Online. ETH online was the month of October.
00:08:14.590 - 00:09:24.860, Speaker A: We took the entire sort of month from the second to today to focus on Summits and the hackathon. The hackathon piece was the first three weeks of October that concluded last Thursday, and we have our finale today along with our last Summit. And we had the pleasure of hosting 700 hackers and over 2600 Summit attendees who span from 65 different countries and 19 different time zones. We were absolutely blown away by the interest and the reach that these events have gotten, especially as we transition to a bit more of an online setting. And collectively, these 710 hackers submitted and worked on 175 projects. And this is just absolutely amazing because once we kind of put all the numbers together, we had 1730 hackers this year who collectively contributed 473 projects to the Ethereum ecosystem. And the part that makes me happy the most is a few of these projects became some well funded companies.
00:09:24.860 - 00:10:17.106, Speaker A: A lot of them stayed really interesting and fun experiments. But 100% of these projects were built because the team that built them really wanted that to exist and they did it for their own benefit. And that's really the Ethos we try to kind of continue at ETH Global and in this space and today is going to be no different. So on top of all of that, this kind of is really well tied into why we chose today for our impact as the topic for the last Summit. Beyond just showcasing what we've seen in this space from the developer side, ethereum has had an enormous impact in the Web Three, but also just the global economy this year. And we want to really highlight how that's touching a lot of other industries later today. So let's come back to ETH online.
00:10:17.106 - 00:11:11.766, Speaker A: For those of you who are watching in and were not participants, ETH Online was structured to be the Hackathon and Summit. The Hackathon, which was the first three weeks, kind of concluded last Thursday. Then we had five summits. Our first Summit was our kickoff summit, where we did a lot of introduction sessions on various things that we were going to hint about for the next few Summits, and that took place on the 2 October. Then we moved into scaling and infrastructure where we talked all things layer two, and that happened on the 9th Friday, the 9 October, then our Summit on the 16th for all things DFI on what people are excited about, what people are building, and what we're going to see in the space over the next few years. And then last Friday on October the 23rd, we had our Summit on the Future of Ethereum, where we talked about all things E two and what all of you can look forward to very soon. And today, of course, is our Summit on Impact.
00:11:11.766 - 00:12:01.990, Speaker A: And to kind of see what we have in the works, you can open up the schedule module on your live page and check out all the talks we have planned for today. And I do want to say this thing a few more times. Your excitement has been absolutely phenomenal. We've seen so many people get excited about the things they've been able to learn, they've been able to build, the help they've been able to get, and just the support they've been able to get, whether it's from our sponsors or other developers and mentors. So these 175 projects presented to our judges over the weekend a few days ago. And from there, we saw a massive spectrum of projects that everybody tackled on. We saw people working on DFI and NFTs, we saw people working on DevTools and decentralized storage, people played around with governance and dows.
00:12:01.990 - 00:12:42.182, Speaker A: And people also tried to integrate scaling and layer two solutions into their hacks. And we're really kind of seeing this audience push forward how we want the next few months to the next few years to look like. And it's really kind of amazing to see and get a preview of what's going to be on everybody's list six months from now today. And we want to kind of give you a peek at that as well. Not just the hackers, we had 120 mentors that were available for this event and we had participation from 36 different companies. These are just some of the faces that we were able to put up on this live deck. But these are people who are there as judges, speakers, mentors.
00:12:42.182 - 00:13:49.406, Speaker A: And we had an amazing set of companies that were here as sponsors and just overall companies that agreed to kind of give their time to a lot of our developers to help them not only just understand what they can do with their protocols. But also, were there anywhere from daytime to 03:00 a.m at night to kind of really help address any technical issues these projects were having? A lot of them were beginners to really kind of understanding and giving them advice on best practices to how they can make their lives easier and unblock themselves as they were continuing to finish their hacks. So I want to thank all of our sponsors for kind of just being with us for the last month as well. And that kind of brings me to the main event for today, which is our demos. So 175 of these projects went through judging and from there we got these twelve teams that are going to be presenting to us on this call. These were some of the twelve most creative things that we found and we're super excited to have all of them kind of come on and showcase to you all what they've done.
00:13:49.406 - 00:14:27.130, Speaker A: So what I want to do is just in a particular order, kind of call out all these teams. I want to thank all of them for kind of being with us today on this call to demo. So we have liquid l Two, batua flashbank stop loss syndicate and unite. And then mindful protect protocol. Croco, finance, space. DX Earthstall and dpay These are some really sweet hacks that we're going to see today and we're going to just sort of talk about how we're going to structure the rest of these demos. And as we were kind of thinking about how to bring the teams on this call for the demo, we kind of noticed some really obvious themes that a lot of these projects tackled.
00:14:27.130 - 00:15:37.920, Speaker A: There's quite a few number of projects that are working on consumer adoption, whether that's for payments or for investors, and kind of managing portfolios to people who are solving scaling heads on with really creative solutions that kind of are compatible with what we are doing today in Web Three and Ethereum. And then we have a super interesting theme about people really kind of getting to manage and increase and collaborate with their community. So we have a lot of projects that are solving that problem heads on. And then lastly, it should be no surprise that there are a lot of D Five projects and we're going to see some really creative protocols and primitives today as part of these twelve teams. And kind of before we jump into the demo, I really want to kind of take a few seconds and point out that just because your project was not on this list of twelve, it does not mean you were not good enough or there was something wrong. This is meant to be a celebration and not a competition. So I really want to thank all the 163 teams here on this slide to kind of really continue building what you've been doing for the past few weeks.
00:15:37.920 - 00:16:35.346, Speaker A: This is a place for us to give you the support you need to get to that finish line. And not just because that's kind of what the structure of the event is, but also this is what we want to do after the event finishes. A lot of you have already kind of reached out to us and talked about how you can make what help you need to bring this to reality and really finish what you originally wanted to do. So we encourage all of you to kind of reach out to the global team, our sponsors, our mentors, with any help you need to kind of continue building. And as you kind of showcase what you've done, put those links and demos and websites on the event discord. There's over a couple of thousand people on our discord that are waiting to give you feedback and check out and try your projects and I really encourage all of you to do that. So on top of all of that, every hack that came out of this project is available to see on Hack ETHGlobal Co.
00:16:35.346 - 00:17:36.870, Speaker A: So if you ever want to catch up on what these themes are or which teams kind of worked on what problems, you can always go to this domain and see the list of all projects. So that said, I want to sort of jump into our first few demos and we have four special guests who are going to be joining us today to help with kind of sharing that excitement with us. And I want to welcome Andre, who's also known as RAC, and Grammy award winning artist. I want to welcome Camila Russo from The Defiant, stani from Ave, and Ashley Jap from Uniswap. They'll be with us for the next couple of hours looking at and commenting on and giving a lot of feedback on these twelve teams. And with that, we are ready to get started. So what we're going to do is we're going to bring on our very first category of projects and that is going to be the consumer categories at this point, like to kind of have all of our special guests and judges kind of turn their cameras on and say hi to all of our audiences.
00:17:36.870 - 00:18:09.108, Speaker A: And we'll have these four projects come in order. So we have Mindful, Batua, Croco, Finance and Dpay. They'll come one by one and we'll present their projects for five minutes and then we'll invite all of them back for a group Q A. So without further ado, let's get our first ever demo started. And I want to welcome the Mindful team and I'll let them sort of kick it off with their first demo. Cool. Just sharing my screen here.
00:18:09.108 - 00:18:49.620, Speaker A: We can see a cryptid degenerate in his natural habitat. He rejects proven safe strategies in favor of being an ape, buying tops and selling buttons time and time again, demolishing his hard earned gains, ruining his chances of accumulating generational wealth. Training is a hard game to play, but what if you didn't have to play it? The Daily Nama. Once a discipline smart, contract based investment strategies lead to happiness. Undisciplined degeneracy leads to suffering. It is time to silence dua degeneracy. Introducing mindful portfolio of alignment for Dgens.
00:18:49.620 - 00:19:29.728, Speaker A: Thanks for that intro, David. So now we're going to dig into Mindful what we built and how we managed to solve portfolio alignment for Dgens. So, a bit about the team. We're all a bunch of Dgens who all suffered a common problem, and that was that we would trade these crypto assets, farm, pickles, make money, but normally we would end up losing more money than we thought we should have. We always had this issue of buying assets and never really selling them and struggling with figuring out when we should enter and exit into the market. So the solution we came up was a product called Mindful, which we'll dig into now and just a bit about the team. You can see from all our flags that we're from all around the world.
00:19:29.728 - 00:20:09.820, Speaker A: And I think that's a really important thing about the ethereum ecosystem to have diversity and variety. So what we built is a tool that lets you create your own portfolio of assets. You can define what assets go into this portfolio and then define some strategies such as DCAing into the strategy that will automatically market by the tokens within that strategy. And then you can sell tokens from the strategy when certain thresholds are met. What makes Mindful unique is that these strategies are set and forget. They're codified into smart contracts and that makes them completely trustless. You own this strategy, which we call a chakra, and you can completely have self sovereign ownership over that.
00:20:09.820 - 00:20:38.644, Speaker A: It's automatic. Profit taking is also an important part here in the sense that we have like a relayer network, which we'll dig into a bit later, that will automatically execute these strategies on your behalf. And the last cool feature is that these are balancer pools. So you actually get fees from using these chakras as people trade against your assets. So we're going to jump into a demo. So we're going to start off by creating a chakra so we can name it and then we can go and specify some assets. So let's put some uni in this.
00:20:38.644 - 00:21:09.864, Speaker A: Let's put some cream and let's put some uma. So this is a very Mindful strategy we're going for here. We can specify the ratios and we really put a lot of time and thought into the UX, so we can specify how much we want of each of these assets. And then we can see the breakdown. Next we can choose what the initial contribution asset we want to use. So we could use something like other interest bearing Dai or USDC. And that means that we're going to actually take tokens out of our wallets and buy in the proportions that we defined in the table here.
00:21:09.864 - 00:21:36.516, Speaker A: So we're going to convert 100 USDC into this proportion. Then on the next screen, we can define these strategies. And this is really the key of what Mindful is. The first one is the DCA strategy. So we could specify the frequency that we want to perform actions, let's say weekly, and then say like, what token we want to actually trade at a weekly frequency. So maybe an interest bearing token again is a good idea. So we specify how many tokens we want to put in and that will then trade on a weekly basis this number of tokens into the chakra.
00:21:36.516 - 00:22:08.720, Speaker A: We can then also specify a profit taking strategy. So this will be a percentage of the chakra or a percentage profit. So we'll say for like every 10% increase, we want to take 5% of the chakra in some other token. So maybe you want to take your profit in wet or you want to take your profit in another interest bearing token. Then finally we get the confirmation screen and we can deploy the chakra. For now, main net deployments are disabled because we got to be Mindful and haven't had an audit yet, which is kind of important. So just to jump across to a sample chakra to show you what the interface looks like.
00:22:08.720 - 00:22:40.110, Speaker A: So we can see this is an example chakra with some assets in it which look pretty good. We can see like the historic values over time. We can zoom in and out of this kind of Xerion type interface. We can also see some information here. We can FOMO in, which is effectively a deposit, FOMO out, which is like a withdrawal. We can edit the strategy, edit the DCA strategy, edit the profit taking strategy. We can view the asset breakdown of everything within the chakra and lastly view the history of all the actions that the chakra has done.
00:22:40.110 - 00:23:48.688, Speaker A: So how does Mindful work? So each of these chakras is a smart balancer pool which is deployed using the Mindful proxy. And basically the Mindful proxy has special permissions over the chakras, which lets a network of relayers perform specific actions like doing the DCA strategies and the profit taking strategies. When a DCA strategy is executed, what happens is that the asset that you're trading gets transferred to the Mindful proxy and then traded on Uniswap for the underlying tokens within the balancer pool and then deposited into the balancer pool. We use Uniswap to avoid any kind of slippage and basically the inverse happens when withdrawing. So what's next for Mindful? So any kind of prize money that we get at the hackathon and any fundraising we get afterwards, first and foremost is going to go for an audit because you can't launch something like this and call it Mindful unless it's been audited. And then the next thing is we want to build like a find a guru strategy functionality, which basically does like copy trading, where you can view other Mindful portfolios and copy those chakras. There's a bunch of other stuff on this list that we want to get to, but in the interest of time, basically we want to make the product as good as possible and accessible to as many people as possible.
00:23:48.688 - 00:24:09.764, Speaker A: So this is Mindful. You can follow us on Twitter if you want to stay up to date with when we launch on mainnet. And yeah, thank you for your time. Awesome. Thanks, Chris. So what we'll do is I know there's a lot of questions already we're going to have from all of us here. So I'll just ask all of you to stay on the call and we'll move on to the next demo and we'll just bring all the questions back to the Q A.
00:24:09.764 - 00:24:45.204, Speaker A: So next up we have Chris, who's going to be talking for Batua and Chris. Whenever you're ready, feel free to share us your demo. Okay. Hi, I'm Chris, and I will talk on behalf of Batwa. Batua is a new concept for cryptocurrency in India. We are an international team of three women and two men with a nucleus in the Himalayan mountains and a satellite in New Delhi. The word batwa is a phonetic spelling of the word wallet in the Hindi language.
00:24:45.204 - 00:25:36.840, Speaker A: The aim was to paint a picture of what is technically possible today, combining some wellunderstood crypto primitives with an emerging layer two solution and some bespoke development to make a robust and usable wallet ready for adoption. The project delivered a simple mobile first web wallet interface with metatransactions on layer two, which allow users of the wallet to transact with rupesa, an ERC 20 stablecoin pegged to the Indian rupee. India really is a diverse country, but is united in using rupee. Digital payments are already common, with users scanning QR codes and paying real money for meals, out, street food and accommodation. Paper money has obvious challenges in India, and scenes like these happen on a weekly basis. So with a population of nearly 1.4 billion and 700 million smartphones, it's reasonable to expect Batwa to find product market fit in India.
00:25:36.840 - 00:26:14.432, Speaker A: So let's dive deeper into the project. We started with user research exploring a wide cross section of the population. One persona was Ramesh the chaiwala? He does not have a bank account, so he cannot accept digital payments. But he does, however, have a smartphone and can use Batwa for receiving money. Our research into language diversity showed eleven widely used Internet languages in India, which were all very much part of the culture. This led us to design a minimal onboarding flow where a user can select their language, ending up in a simple wallet with both light and dark modes. We try to keep a beginner's mindset when designing the payment flow with clear calls to action.
00:26:14.432 - 00:26:57.148, Speaker A: We also have an early prototype design for an investor flow for minting ropesA. This brings us nicely to the stablecoin architecture. So we felt the culture around the Indian rupee was significant to the concept and thus warranted its own stablecoin, and that it also ought to be decently governed and non custodial. So we dusted off MakerDAO's single collateral contracts, deployed them on Gurley's maker cow. But with a few small changes, users can deposit ETH as collateral and mint rupesa. The peg price is set by a chainlink Oracle, which gets Ethinr price data from cryptocompair. There's also a governance component with cow as the governance token, and another Oracle from Uniswap governing rewards and fees when repaying the loan.
00:26:57.148 - 00:27:40.108, Speaker A: This architecture can hopefully inspire future projects launching other stablecoins. Now, let me tell you about the gas's payment system. We've got Indian rupee on layer one, but layer one is pretty expensive right now, especially for small transactions. So it's matic to the rescue with their layer two chain tokens from layer one can be zapped to layer two via the Proof of Stake Bridge, where the Batua Web Wallet can retrieve its balance for transferring Rupesa, batua signs and posts transactions to Biconomy's Relayer, which pays the gas and publishes on Matic. So now it's time to show this thing in action. Here is a link in case you're watching along and you want to use Baturu as well. You can add Invest for alpha features.
00:27:40.108 - 00:28:19.804, Speaker A: I will now switch to the live app. So what you're seeing on the screen now is the live app for Batua. It's getting its rupesa balance from Matix Mumbai testnet. These rupesa were minted on Gurley and then deposited onto layer two. There's a way for a user to see their address and also to show a QR code, which makes it easy for receiving payments. And then there's a simple backup phrase with your magic works. So what we're going to do now is we're going to test sending using this.
00:28:19.804 - 00:28:36.880, Speaker A: So there's me here's. A QR code is coming. QR code scanner. Further out, further out, further out. Okay, nice. So scan the QR code. We're going to send Rs10, which is about $13 cents and about enough for one chai from Rummish.
00:28:36.880 - 00:29:26.560, Speaker A: And that's going to get sent off the Biconomy for transaction, for processing. And like that, Matic has processed it and it's been paid. So that's the layer two app. What we also have to quickly demonstrate is the layer one app, which is like the Investor Flow, which is an end to end process for someone to deposit Gurley ETH into a CDP on Makercow, Mint, some rupesa and then third step, send that rupesa to layer two for spending. So I can kick off the process here of locking some ETH in a CDP that will take a few transactions on Gurley. So I've already locked some collateral earlier today and I'm going to borrow against that 10,000. That's about $130 and that's going to go off and get mined.
00:29:26.560 - 00:29:53.530, Speaker A: And then, because I want to buy some more chai, I'm going to zap RS100 at a layer two. That's going to take about three minutes using Matic's Proof of Stake Bridge and that will show up there later. Trust me, I've been testing it all day. It works. So that's the live demo. We're sharing a few ideas on next steps, but I think we're probably just about out of time now. I'd now like to open up the floor to questions.
00:29:53.530 - 00:30:26.068, Speaker A: Thanks, Chris. Awesome demo. There's a few questions that I have myself too, but what we'll do is we'll just have the next two teams present and then we'll have all of you come on for Q and A and for all of our kind of judges and guests. If you have any questions, just make sure you write them down so you can ask them one after another in ten minutes. So with that, we are ready to move on to our third demo for the consumer category and that is going to be Croco Finance. And I think Robert is here ready to present. So Robert, whenever you're ready, go for.
00:30:26.068 - 00:30:43.370, Speaker A: Yes. Hi. So I am Robert from Croco Finance and let me show you who we are and what we've built for Etoman. Hackathon several. We're not seeing the slides yet, but I'll let you do that. Yeah. Okay, let me fix that.
00:30:43.370 - 00:31:08.880, Speaker A: Can you see my screen? Yes, loud and clear? Yeah. Good. So I'm Robert from Croco Finance. Let me show you who we are and what we did and what Croco Finance is. So we are a team of two people. I've built this with my friend Jan. We are both based in Czech Republic and I was responsible for the front end and my friend was responsible for the backend.
00:31:08.880 - 00:31:42.110, Speaker A: And the goal of Croco Finance is to help liquidity providers understand their money flow. We realized that there was a big hype about yacht farming and all this stuff. And I think a lot of people realize that it's not actually profitable at some point. So we wanted to make it absolutely clear for everybody what will happen with their money when they deposit to some liquidity pool. So let me show you the demo. This is our landing page where we ask the user for his Ethereum address. So I will paste an Ethereum address and go to the app.
00:31:42.110 - 00:32:30.012, Speaker A: This will take me to dashboard where we show the user his pools. We have active pools and past positions. And for each pool we can see how much fees he earned, what were his yield, farming gains, how much he paid for transactions. We don't have it yet for uniswap, but it will be ready in a few days and we can compute his impermanent loss. And here the user see his balance compared to buy and hold strategy. And this pool can be we also have another feature called simulator. So I will go there, I will open this pool in simulator and here the user can simulate how will changes in assets prices, how will these changes affect this portfolio value.
00:32:30.012 - 00:33:21.180, Speaker A: So I say for example I want to see what happens when the price of repbc doubles. I see on the right here that my impermanent loss compared to the current state will increase by $1,500 approximately and my total balance compared to bindroll strategy will be like -1000 $400 so yes I don't want for BTC to increase that much in price compared to ETH and user can place with these values however he wants. I can place 30 in here or whatever and we can compute this. We can do this for uniswap and balancer. This is for uniswap. I can choose balancer pool here for Keep where the tokens have different weights. Keep has 80% frapped ETH has 20%.
00:33:21.180 - 00:34:01.896, Speaker A: I can do the same thing here. I can play with. The values and we will compute impermanent loss for the user. So this was the demo and let me tell you how we made it. First we had to derive the equations for uniswap and balancer because we know the equations for automated market maker equation. But we need to derive the formulas to compute impermanent loss so we can separate the gains from fees and the loss from impermanent loss. And once we had the equations we could build it.
00:34:01.896 - 00:34:44.084, Speaker A: And on back end we used the graph and Python to process the data and on front end we use react and TypeScript. And our next steps, the first step is to improve the stability and tui of the current state of the app. We are already working on this. We want to improve the stability by using a custom database because right now we fetch the historical data every time the user paste his address. But the history is always the same. So we can store it in a database and just match the current state and compute the things we need. And we want to adjust the user interface for pools with multiple deposits and withdrawals.
00:34:44.084 - 00:35:45.816, Speaker A: For now, the UI works best for pools with single deposit because impermanent loss is quite well defined for pools where you withdraw part of your money and then deposit another part. So this is what we are working on now. And then we want to support more platforms and analyze, make more sophisticated strategies, advise the user what might be a good idea when to withdraw his money and of course keep up with the ever changing DeFi space and adapt to the so that was it. Amazing. Thanks Robert. And this is something that I do want to talk about in the Q A but this immediately plugs into mindful where if you are a Dgen, you get to see how good or bad you were. So with that, we are ready for our last demo for this category and that is going to be Project Dpay.
00:35:45.816 - 00:36:48.930, Speaker A: So Sebastian, whenever you're ready, we'll have you kick off with your demo and then we'll start the Q A session for this group. Hi everyone, I'm Sebastian, software engineer from Zurich, Switzerland and I'm going to present Dpay, a decentralized payment processing solution that allows developers to easily offer crypto payments to their users. But first, let me explain why Hive built Dpay. The payment experience in a decentralized web is still rudimentary at best. A lot of websites and DApps out there that implement crypto payments, they often require you to go to an exchange first to get either their utility token or any token the website accepts. This is neither good for conversion nor for adaption. The average user is overwhelmed by centralized exchange KYCs or the risks and underlying mechanisms of decentralized exchanges.
00:36:48.930 - 00:37:44.598, Speaker A: When users perform payments, the only thing they care about is how much he or she has to pay, preferably presented in a way the user understands. I'm glad I was able to raise the payment experience in the decentralized web to a new level. During the hackathon, I've built an easy to implement, easy to use, decentralized payment solution and I'm going to show you in detail how that's working. If you want to receive payments in the decentralized web, you can now use the Dpay payment Widget. You configure what payment you would like to receive for your service or product and you then place this button on your website or D app. And now when users click that button, they will see an easy to use and state of the art payment dialog. The moment the dialog opens, Dpay scans the user's wallet for all assets of value.
00:37:44.598 - 00:38:29.570, Speaker A: It detects liquidity pools that would allow to exchange the asset to what the seller wants, rates the potential routes and selects the most efficient route for the user. The Dpay payment dialog also focuses on displaying local currency prices and values. In this example, us. Dollars. This allows the user to grasp and comprehend the amount he or she is going to pay. In this example, Dpay suggests to pay in uni tokens the seller requested nine Ether. But because the user doesn't have enough Ether, dpay suggests to use uni as the means of payment, swapping it via uniswap to Ether and sending the requested nine Ether to the seller all in one transaction.
00:38:29.570 - 00:39:22.224, Speaker A: If a seller requests a token the user actually has in his wallet, dpay is going to suggest to transfer that token directly as it would be the most efficient route. But the user does not have to stick to the preselected route. Maybe I want to hang on to my Dai so I can just select any other token in my wallet that is exchangeable on a decentralized exchange as a means of payment. But for this demo, let's stick with Dai. Okay? Now let's actually perform this payment and let's be extra generous to miners. This is on Mainnet and we all know how long that sometime can take. We could click this again and it will lead us straight to Ether scan so we can stare at our transaction while it's processing.
00:39:22.224 - 00:40:19.430, Speaker A: Or in the meantime, I can quickly show two more ways of taking the Dpay components and reassemble them into two other very useful ways. First, token offerings which allow you to easily offer your tokens to your users on your website directly. Second, token swap widgets which allow you to make token swaps part of your website or DApp. Okay, let's see if the payment already succeeded in the background. Yes, it did. What happened here is that the payment dialogue handed over to the website again after the payment has been confirmed so that the website or DApp can now display a payment confirmation. If we have a look at the transaction, we see that the Dpay payment processor smart contract sent the requested Dai from the buyer to the seller.
00:40:19.430 - 00:40:57.654, Speaker A: It also emitted a dedicated blockchain event that helps to identify that particular payment later on. In another example, we see how the Dpay payment processor smart contract takes a particular token from the buyer. In this case, the Dpay token, swaps it via uniswap to wrapped eater and sends the requested wrapped eater to the seller. Again, all in one transaction. I would love to see you start using Dpay reach out and I will gladly help you to implement it. Thank you for listening. Amazing.
00:40:57.654 - 00:41:44.054, Speaker A: Thanks, Sebastian. So that concludes our first group of four amazing demos. And what I'd like to do is ask all of our hackers and judges to kind of turn their cameras on and we'll kind of go into a really massive Q and A. And what I'll do is I'll just kind of kick it off by just simply highlighting that majority of these projects are ready for people to use right now. And that is absolutely incredible. I think the fact that we're able to not only just do this in the last three weeks and kind of show what people can do with the tools and the technology we have right now, we can make it easy for them to use this immediately. Almost everything is ready to be used by people right now.
00:41:44.054 - 00:42:25.250, Speaker A: And that to me, just is absolutely amazing. One other theme I noticed is that it is a pretty broad way to kind of categorize what consumer adoption looks like. There's people who want to have bullets and money for the first time. There's category of users who are active traders and they just need tools to be better at their own roles. And there's just in general payments that enables anywhere from e commerce to a lot of other clever integrations that DeFi enables. So these are really amazing, interesting themes here. And I want to kind of open this up for all four of our judges and see if they have any comments and questions or feedback.
00:42:25.250 - 00:42:50.746, Speaker A: And to make this a lot easier, I'll ask everyone to unmute themselves so we're not doing the ping pong of who's muted. I could jump in here. First of all, I love all these. These have been super interesting. And like Critique said, they're super all over the place, span a lot of things. Consumer category can be pretty broad. I have just a couple specific questions.
00:42:50.746 - 00:43:23.794, Speaker A: I mean, again, this is all pretty broad, but with Batua specifically, I'm curious more on the back end. Actually. I thought the maker cow concept was really interesting. Are you thinking in terms of I assume there would be sort of an interest rate for borrowing or for creating the token. Right. How are you defining that? By governance or by an automated interest rate? Kind of like as is, we just copy paste a lot of the makerdas stuff. It would be a gov vote.
00:43:23.794 - 00:43:50.080, Speaker A: So we'd have these cow token, governance tokens to vote, but we were also plugging Uniswap Oracles into makerdown here. So on chain Uniswap Oracle, we could get a real on chain price and use that to auto set the fee by comparing it to the peg price. So then it's too cheap. We can mint more or mint less without requiring a governance vote every time.
00:43:52.930 - 00:44:08.500, Speaker B: Awesome. Great job, guys. Very cool project. I have a question for Dpay. So as far as actual payment rails, is that all going through uniswap or is it uniswap and a combination of other things?
00:44:08.870 - 00:44:24.870, Speaker A: I had the chance to actually abstract the routing, so during the hackathon, I also plugged in Mooneyswap, and while it tries to calculate the best routes, it considers both exchanges to calculate the best routes.
00:44:25.530 - 00:44:48.990, Speaker B: Gotcha. Okay, very cool. And how does it actually look on the receiving end for someone that's actually accepting this payment? Are they just receiving it in the currency that they've requested, or do they have some kind of portal to turn it into their local fiat currency?
00:44:49.910 - 00:45:06.120, Speaker A: They request whatever currency they want. There are a lot of stablecoins out there for a lot of local currencies already, so potentially offramp becomes less and less of an issue if you get the stablecoin of your local currency already.
00:45:07.050 - 00:45:11.686, Speaker B: Yeah, this was a great project. I really liked it. It looks like a smooth interface. So great work.
00:45:11.788 - 00:45:12.600, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:45:14.190 - 00:45:30.558, Speaker B: Yeah. I just want to first congratulate everyone. Everything looks amazing. I can't believe you did all this in three weeks. It's always incredible to be at these hackathons. It's just really inspiring. So congrats everyone.
00:45:30.558 - 00:46:03.880, Speaker B: And I really love the mindful app. I just thought the UX was super nice and just simple and felt like something a lot of people would want to use right away. My question there, especially when that kind of chart sloping downwards came up, made me wonder if you're thinking of ways to maybe short a strategy as well.
00:46:07.210 - 00:46:37.490, Speaker A: Interesting. I mean, you could put short tokens into your chakra. You could use synthetics as inverse tokens in your chakra to get short exposure to a particular underlying but the way it's designed is you can think of it as like your own balancer pool. So whatever you can put in a balancer pool, you could put in your chakra. You could have like, an inverse chakra that's just a collection of inverse pool tokens. If you're a bear and you just want to take profit on the way down, that could be kind of an interesting strategy.
00:46:38.390 - 00:46:50.950, Speaker B: Cool. And then I didn't really understand how the relayer network works. Will you have kind of incentives for relayers to execute these transactions?
00:46:51.290 - 00:47:24.820, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, I rushed over that bit. But the way it's set up now is that basically 0.3% of the trade size, which is the same as the uniswap fee goes to the person who executes the relayer call. So they can permissionlessly anyone can permissionlessly call this. So it's incentivized to have it basically ends up being like a gas wall for who can call it first? In the beginning we would run a bot like this and that could potentially be an avenue for profitability until it becomes competitive and everyone else is trying to do the same thing.
00:47:25.270 - 00:47:25.826, Speaker B: Cool.
00:47:25.928 - 00:47:26.580, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:47:27.990 - 00:47:29.060, Speaker B: Really nice.
00:47:32.010 - 00:48:13.970, Speaker A: Yeah. Congratulations everyone. I mean this was a pretty interesting hackathon and a lot of cool hacks. I could start with Croco finance. I think I've seen recently quite a lot of practically dashboards where you could monitor your positions usually in DeFi, various protocols or aggregators. They don't offer maybe the best user experience or overview of your whole exposure in DeFi. So dashboards are really good tools and the simulator is amazing.
00:48:13.970 - 00:49:35.398, Speaker A: I think that is something that really helps everyone and saves also headache in the sense that you can actually identify how much you get exposure, how much your impermanent loss might be. And also probably you can even further develop the product in a way that you have a service that actually could or like a bot that could actually trigger or be triggered by some sort of keeper network in the sense that it cuts the position if the impermanent loss becomes higher. So that could be interesting. And one of the things when I look at the dashboards, they're becoming very beautiful and that's like a nice thing. But also what's important is this kind of like helpfulness in accounting and taxation. So practically I think many people who are in DeFi today are actually thinking now or discussing with their accountants and tax advisors like whether something is a taxable event or not. And that becomes probably more bigger thing in DeFi and people need really a lot of tools.
00:49:35.398 - 00:51:09.834, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure that's the case for the mindful. Are those chakras built in a way that anyone can join them or is it something that you practically create and it's only visible for you or is there like a pulled component? Because I remember you folks were saying something about the social trading aspect but the current ones can I basically create one and let's say, could Ashley and Camilla join the same chakra? No, they can't. So balancer has different kinds of pools. This is a controlled pool and the reason it's controlled is because if you want to update the weightings retroactively after it's deployed, it needs to still be controlled so the person who creates the pool can update the waitings. There is a way that you can create pools that can be updated after the fact and like pi dows, like D five plus and these kinds of tokens where you can change the weightings retroactively governed by a dow could work, but there is quite a lot of risk with that. So if I was to create a pool and then add a token that I can control the supply and then shift the weighting to be 100% and then I could rug pull everyone who's in the pool, basically. So at least in the beginning, that's not what we're going to do.
00:51:09.834 - 00:51:53.282, Speaker A: But the copy strategy would basically just update your chakra to follow other chakras and then in the future we could have a more sophisticated system. There is just complexity around who can control the pool. Because of this. You don't want to get rugged from your chakra. And when you are depositing, is that kind of like position tokenized, for example, each chakras, are they basically tokenized? Yeah. So you would say you go from one asset into your chakra, that asset gets traded to all the underlying and then deposited into the balancer pool. And then in exchange for depositing you get balancer pool tokens, which are like liquidity provider tokens that they're tokenized representation of your liquidity.
00:51:53.282 - 00:52:36.978, Speaker A: And then when you withdraw, you basically return those to the chakra. Then you get back the awesome. Awesome. Thanks. I just have a kind of question for the Kroger finance team. What is kind of the process like for supporting a new protocol, especially as some of them have their own new mechanics that may not just be compatible with something that already exists? And how easy is that for you to add and kind of what else goes into supporting that? So basically all the Croco finance relies on the impermanent loss formula. So what do we need to do for the new protocols? We need to basically fetch the reserves and match it to those equations.
00:52:36.978 - 00:53:18.180, Speaker A: So like, adding new platforms is not as easy as putting a contract address to the app, but it's not like difficult from a software development point of view. Seems like Robert was going to say something. Yes. For the simulator we need to derive the formulas, like theoretical formulas to compute impermanent loss so we can recompute it in advance. So there are these two things to derive the formulas and make the software to fetch the data and recompute it. Gotcha. And then I also had a question for the butWA team.
00:53:18.180 - 00:54:08.180, Speaker A: I guess any of you tried to get some feedback from people using the app. I'm just curious, what have some of the reactions been? Especially for an audience that may have not done crypto before? Yeah, right. So we did get the app, like an early app in the hands of real users in real scenarios, but with test money. For me, the most interesting thing was the reaction that someone could have money stored somewhere without needing a username and password and two factor authentication and all these user experience hurdles. And we were able to explain and explain that the wallet is getting minted in the background and it's stored in the browser session. A lot of surprise by how quickly they got an account. We were looking, oh, I already have an account, I just loaded the page.
00:54:09.430 - 00:54:37.740, Speaker B: Right. We actually just wanted to really step into the user's shoes and as we did that, we really realized that we need to keep the app super simple and minimal to create a Fictionless flow for the users. So I think that was the major aim there and I think if as and when Bhatwa moves forwards, UX is something we're really going to dig deeper into. So that's of course there awesome.
00:54:41.550 - 00:55:21.274, Speaker A: I added just a question for Mindful. So it's obviously based on balancer pools. I think there's a limitation of eight assets per pool. Right. Is there a way around that or is that sort of like hard coded into just how balancer works? That's a balancer restriction. We tried to keep as much code from their side as possible without modifying it. And we also borrowed a lot of code from Pydao specifically in how the chakras are created and they have similar logic in their pools and that the strategy is really to write as little high risk code as we can.
00:55:21.274 - 00:55:47.346, Speaker A: That's where the issues would come from if things were to break is at those two points. So yeah, limited to eight. And also you can't have less than 2% of one asset in a pool. Right. I think I maybe saw something on the deck about find a guru type of a thing. From the way you're describing it, since you can't have people join your pool. Is that sort of like copying it? Is that the approach? Yeah.
00:55:47.346 - 00:56:07.850, Speaker A: It would be similar to set protocols like copy strategies, but where you would literally just set up your chakra to mimic someone else's and if they did any specific actions, you would copy those actions. But in the long run, I think depositing into someone else's chakra makes the most sense when we can figure out how to make it rug proof.
00:56:10.670 - 00:56:35.780, Speaker B: I had one more question for Croco Finance. I saw that you guys in your description mentioned that you created two of your own subgraphs, which is pretty cool. One of them, which I guess was an official uniswap subgraph. I'm curious, what were the things that you needed that you weren't able to get from the official uniswap subgraph and what was the experience of creating your own subgraph like?
00:56:37.510 - 00:57:06.620, Speaker A: So in order to get the yield rewards and to account for them, there was not that information. So we had to create a subgraph for the uni pool smart contract and basically we get all the withdrawals from those contracts, how much the user already claimed, and then we also needed to use the Web Three library in order to get the unclaimed rewards. Yes.
00:57:07.630 - 00:57:08.620, Speaker B: Got you.
00:57:09.250 - 00:57:47.020, Speaker A: Cool. Very good. I have a question for the botwa and there is practically if I understood, you create the CDP in the layer one and then you kind of port the tokens into layer two to the matic. Right. Correct me if I'm wrong. Of course. So what happens if I want to close the CDP? Do you have to wait to withdraw the funds from matic and then go and close the CDP on the layer one.
00:57:50.670 - 00:57:55.562, Speaker B: Yeah, you have to exit the layer two, get back on layer one and.
00:57:55.616 - 00:57:58.442, Speaker A: Then close the CDP or by new.
00:57:58.496 - 00:58:01.614, Speaker B: RSI on layer one or by new.
00:58:01.652 - 00:58:23.070, Speaker A: RSA on and how long it takes to actually close the CDP. If you are in layer two and you need to go back if you want. The limitation of the matic POS bridge.
00:58:23.150 - 00:58:36.140, Speaker B: Is like in testnet right now is just few minutes, three, four minutes. But in terms of exit problem, there will be can be delays up to a yeah, yeah.
00:58:36.510 - 00:59:29.820, Speaker A: One interesting thing is you could create different kinds of solutions to make it faster. Let's say you could use for example, something like credit delegation. You pull credit from DeFi to an exit contract and then practically you can have other people financing those exits or some sort of liquidity providers or tokenized exit positions to make it faster. I guess it's not that critical to close a CDP unless you well, actually it is. If the value of the CDP is going down, maybe that's the case, but otherwise I think it's not. That something to something interesting actually. Yeah, I did hear rumors about some innovative stuff using pending withdrawals as collateral for the next step.
00:59:29.820 - 00:59:35.740, Speaker A: Nice. All right, any final questions?
00:59:36.290 - 01:00:22.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I have one for Croco Finance. I'm wondering whether the idea is to become a dashboard that's complementary to something like Sirions or Sappers, specifically geared towards yield farming. And I thought kind of the idea of simply visualizing impermanent loss was really good, but it's the idea to have that plus just like an overall wallet view and this ability to condense all of your wallets in one place. So will you want to expand into this or just drill down on different yield farming features?
01:00:24.110 - 01:00:46.340, Speaker A: So we definitely don't want to focus, we definitely don't want to compete with Zapper Finance and we want to make a perfect tool for liquidity providers in Dexis. And that's our sole focus because we don't think there is much innovation. There would be much innovation if we started competing with Zephyr and such.
01:00:46.790 - 01:00:52.440, Speaker B: Okay, makes sense. No harm in a little competition though.
01:00:56.410 - 01:01:25.034, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, with that, I want to thank all four of our teams here today, especially to a handful of you who are in different time zones, in different parts of the world and in the middle of different things. The Crocodile Finance team especially is in the process of catching a flight. So we were able to make this work out. That's the remaining context that you see on screen. But thanks to all of our teams. So with that we are ready to move on to our next section.
01:01:25.034 - 01:02:37.814, Speaker A: And for those of you who want to stick around for the rest of the demos, we kind of definitely encourage you to kind of stay on the chat, which is join directly on Live E online and we'll be following up with a handful of other announcements for each of you at the end of this call in about an hour and a half. So thanks again and want to congratulate all four of you for presenting and working on your projects and really kind of showing us, especially live, what you were able to do in the past three weeks. And I'm glad that we did not see Murphy's Law in action today. So that said, I am going to present the next category and we'll introduce our next set of projects. The next category is scaling and it's super interesting because we've actually already foreshadowed a handful of themes here. A lot of our projects were trying to combine scaling as new novel approaches to get this in the hands of users right now and also being able to mix scaling and high throughput with DFI right now. So we have two projects that are tacked in scaling and that's Liquid l Two and Earthstall and they'll both come on one after another and then we'll have them kind of go through the same Q and A process again.
01:02:37.814 - 01:03:39.050, Speaker A: And without further ado, I'd like to welcome Tom who's going to be talking about Liquid l Two and I'll let Tom kick off with his demo. I'm Tom French and I'm from London in the UK. And for Ethan line, I created Liquid l Two. So the problem that Liquid l Two is aiming to solve is that there two solutions becoming essential for ethereum but there's very long withdrawal times normally. So for example, for Matic this is normally around 30 minutes but we're getting optimistic roll ups coming along which are going to take up to about a week to actually confirm on main net. As Stanny mentioned, this is a real opportunity cost. If I'm trying to close my batter CDP, I don't want to wait 30 minutes to do so and that adds a lot of friction.
01:03:39.050 - 01:04:57.010, Speaker A: So the way that Liquid l Two kind of solves this is through credit delegation so that people can get instant access to their funds. Way this works is that lenders can use RV's credit delegation to give loans to users who are withdrawing from liability solutions and these loans are going to be backed by their pending withdrawals. The lenders actually know that these loans will be repaid given, assuming that they will be confirmed onto Mainnet as the withdrawals are managed by smart contracts. So I'm going to quickly show you a rough sketch of the architecture and then I'll do a demo from the user's perspective. So let's say that I'm a user on a Led Two solution and I want to withdraw some money. I can go to the withdrawal vault factory and initiate a withdrawal that's going to deploy a vault just for me and then this vault will start withdrawing those funds onto Main net. A lender can see that this has occurred by looking at the layer Two chain or through one of the subgraphs that we created, what I created, and then they can delegate credit to the user's vault on Mainnet.
01:04:57.010 - 01:06:24.826, Speaker A: I can then pull those funds out of my vault and pay back my Batwa CDP immediately. And then eventually, this loan needs to get repaid. So once the withdrawal confirms onto Mainnet, either I or the lender can go back to my vault and say, hey, I want to repay this debt, and the vault will claim those funds, pay off whatever loan it has already, and then forward any remaining funds onto me. So here is a quick interface to interact with. Let's say that I have 90 USDC on the matic chain, and I want to withdraw ten of these so I can quickly sign a transaction allowing Liquid L2 to take my funds and send that off. So this has deployed a vault for me and burned those funds. So if I now switch on to looking at this from the gurley testnet, you can see that I now have $20 worth of pending withdrawals, and I've been given a credit limit of $10 by a lender.
01:06:24.826 - 01:07:06.010, Speaker A: So I want to get my $10 out to pay back my CDP. So I'm going to just borrow that, use it my entire credit limit, and that's going to deploy another vault to the same address on Mainnet so I can claim those funds. And then once that transaction confirms, we should see my balance update. But while that's waiting, I'm just going to show what happened on the matic chain. So you can see here, token transfers, where $10 went from my address to my vault. And then the vault started to burn those funds. So that to start a withdrawal.
01:07:06.010 - 01:07:46.390, Speaker A: The fact that these funds start in the vault is what gives Liquid to its security. And you can see my transaction is confirmed and I have my $10. I can now use that wherever I want. If it was the rupees, I could pay back my CDP, send that to uniswap, whatever. I'm happy. As a user, I've got access to my funds, but at some point, I need to repay this loan. So just for the interest of time, I've got a withdrawal that I did earlier, which has confirmed onto the Main chain.
01:07:46.390 - 01:08:13.650, Speaker A: So I can quickly click that. This is going to generate a proof that these funds belong to me and that my vaults can claim them. Unfortunately, it seems like it's not repaying. Oh, there we go. Finally. Sorry. It takes a little bit of time to construct these proofs.
01:08:13.650 - 01:08:42.362, Speaker A: Anyone can kind of perform this step so the lender can know that they will get their funds back, even if I, as a user, never interact with Liquid l Two again. Cancel that. We don't need that now. Yes. Okay. So this repayment transaction has confirmed now, and you can see that my credit limit has dropped to zero. My amount.
01:08:42.362 - 01:09:38.166, Speaker A: That I have borrowed has gone to zero again and you can see that I still have my $10 on main net. Yes, I've got $10 out of Matic in a matter of seconds. Rather than having to wait a full 30 minutes, this sort of solution can I've used a Matic network for this demo, but the actual architecture scales to any layer two solution that uses an EVM compatible chain. All that requires is that we can deploy smart contracts onto that chain. Okay, thank you very much and I'm happy to take any questions later on. Thanks Tom. Yeah, this is something I think just immediately addresses what Sonny just recommended.
01:09:38.166 - 01:10:13.990, Speaker A: So I'll wait for the Q a piece. But with that we'll just let our stall kind of present and they have a really interesting and novel approach to scaling and I'll let them share what they've done. Hi there. Yeah, thanks a lot for the introduction and welcome to Agile, a new scaling solution for ethereum using trusted execution environments. So this is our team. We are a research team perun maybe some people know us from channels, state channels from the Technical University of Dharmst in Germany. And the five hackers are the brilliant guys here with the diamonds on top of their heads.
01:10:13.990 - 01:11:15.018, Speaker A: So to give you an overview, airshell overcomes many plasma limitations with trusted execution environments like Intel SGX. So we have an amortized transaction gas of zero gas. And this is because we do not even need on chain checkpoints. The computational demand is still pretty low because you basically only need a single CPU and we observe a very high transaction throughput you can think channels because we only work with signature verifications and signature generations. And if you're wondering if this is all secure, it's based on research from the Chair of Applied Cryptography at Theodmstech University and the paper is currently in submission. So the architecture works as follows we have an operator who is basically an untrusted message relayer and we have the users, if they want to enter the system, like in any level two, they send a deposit transaction and later on they can also send exit and withdraw transactions. Blocks are forwarded from the operator into the Te.
01:11:15.018 - 01:11:50.898, Speaker A: So the Te basically verifies all the state that's happening on the blockchain. And this is how this even works. And then once users are off chain, they can send signed transactions to the operator who just forwards them into the Te. And then at the end of each so called epoch, the Te generates balance proofs, signed balance proofs and broadcasts those back to the users. So again, there's a little bit of a similarity to channels where users send signed transactions and get confirmations back. And this all progresses in so called epochs. So you have a deposit transaction and exit epochs.
01:11:50.898 - 01:12:16.122, Speaker A: So those are distinct phases, but all of those phases are actually working in parallel. So everything is possible at all times now demo time. So here we have oh, sorry. Is something wrong? Do you see my mouse cursor? Sorry. Okay. Anyway, so here's the ganache. It's a blockchain.
01:12:16.122 - 01:12:35.398, Speaker A: Ganache blockchain. I will start it. It's now completely fresh. We have a couple of accounts with 100 E. I start the operator. So when the operator starts, he deploys the contract. We can see that here.
01:12:35.398 - 01:12:57.130, Speaker A: Contract deployment. And now I'm going to start Alice and Bob. So those are going to be two users in our network. I will start by sending a deposit transaction of 100 each. By the way, this is all implemented using Go. So those are all Go, different Go implementations and Go clients. This is the operator and here are the two clients.
01:12:57.130 - 01:13:23.590, Speaker A: Here we see two transactions that arrived with a value of 100 E. So that's here and now those are shortly in the system. So now they still didn't receive a balance proof yet. Okay, and now the next epoch starts here. And now we have 100 E in both systems. Okay, now we are completely off chain and now we can send transactions. So here I will send, let's say 50 to Bob.
01:13:23.590 - 01:14:05.918, Speaker A: Okay? And since we just had like a nice balance face shift, now we hold only 50 here and Bob already sees the 150 here happening. But the real great thing about this, everything is now off chain, right? So we can just send as many transactions as we want in a very short time. So I'm going to show you a benchmark of 1000 off chain transactions, basically microtransactions of 20 ETH. So the 20 will be divided into 1000 little pieces. Sending and that's it. So we now see over 1000 transactions per second. And what's happening in the background is that Alice is sending all the transactions to the operator.
01:14:05.918 - 01:14:26.010, Speaker A: The operator forwards those to the enclave and then the secure enclave processes everything. And then at the end of the epoch, which just happened here, here you see the live phase meter. We got another 30 deducted, 20 deducted. So we're back at 30. And now we can also leave the system. So I will do that now. Okay, so leave.
01:14:26.010 - 01:14:50.034, Speaker A: So I will send an exit transaction and okay, I don't know what happened here. Let's try that again. And also here. So I will send an exit transaction and once there's a phase shift, we can then withdraw the funds. Okay, so exit got mined here and here, it's also looking good. Okay, nice. And now we should have exited the system.
01:14:50.034 - 01:15:15.510, Speaker A: And you can see in the account suddenly the final balances, 170 and 31. So everything from off chain now applied back on chain. Yeah. So the next steps, the future is testnet. And then finally mainnet deployment, of course. So within global operators, so we all can have transactions together. We want to build like a really good secure enclave because this is more of a prototype, obviously, that we are running right now.
01:15:15.510 - 01:15:47.620, Speaker A: So we will probably use Rust for this, including like side channel resistance. And now the great thing about this technology is that it can actually scale arbitrary smart contracts because you can quite easily leverage just some EVM execution inside the enclave and then you can quite easily even extend this. Yeah, thanks a lot. I hope I convinced you about this new awesome scaling technology. For Ethereum, visit us at Pyramid Network or visit our GitHub parent minus network slash edge. Thanks. Amazing.
01:15:47.620 - 01:16:34.674, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Sebastian. I'd like the parent team and Tom to kind of come on camera and we'll sort of kick off about a ten minute Q and A here. And there's a lot of things going on here, a lot of things that are also over my personally in my head. But I'll kind of kick this off with a question for Ertstal. Is the system able to scale? Because you're assuming that the te is kind of the best kind of way for us to fall back on the security guarantees of the system. Or why this versus any other approaches, we have to off chain scaling and sort of if you can compare and contrast that, I think that'll just be a pretty good context for all of us to yeah.
01:16:34.674 - 01:17:30.850, Speaker A: So the context. Well, if you want to use intel SJX so if you're saying, okay, the security model for me fits, then this just solves many problems. Right? And I think in reality it actually does solve like in reality, I think many people actually would be happy with using this as a scaling solution. And because you have this trusted enclave, you can basically communicate the users with the enclave similar to channels, right? Because you're only exchanging signatures and the operator is basically assumed to be untrusted. The operator can be malicious. And when the operator fails to forward messages, because the operator really is only like a message broker back and forth, and then you can always go on chain and then get your funds back, but because as long as the operator behaves nicely and only forwards all the balance proofs, you don't even need to post checkpoints. And this is where this is even an improvement over other roll ups or CK solutions.
01:17:30.850 - 01:18:15.540, Speaker A: Got it. Quick follow up on that. With respect to kind of I think you already did mention this thing, but just to clarify, where is this solution with respect to kind of being tested right now live on main net or just are there any unsolved problems here in deploying this or kind of where does this rank? So it's based on research that we didn't even get published yet, so it's very brand new. So it's definitely not on Mainet. But we are quite happy with the protocol internally already. So we will definitely move this forward to Mainet in the next few months and I hope we will see more solutions based on this.
01:18:17.110 - 01:18:37.530, Speaker B: I had a quick question for you guys as well. So with regard to the trusted execution environments, use SGX as an example, but I guess you can also use multiparty commutation. Are there any other trusted execution environments you could see being utilized with this?
01:18:37.680 - 01:19:11.534, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome that you're saying this, because actually, usually I would like to have said this, but we didn't say it for time briefly. But MPC is actually another solution that you can use. So basically we could replace the te by some kind of MPC committee and then we could kind of merge the operator with the te to like an MPC committee and then also achieve great scaling using this. And you could probably just like you said, you could probably transfer many of the concepts just to this committee. It's also definitely something we're looking into.
01:19:11.672 - 01:19:15.560, Speaker B: Would there be any major security trade offs for doing that?
01:19:17.290 - 01:19:55.874, Speaker A: You mean with I mean, I guess with have this you still need to trust that at least not everybody's getting malicious or something like this. So this is just from the top of my head what I could think of that. Of course. Well, if everybody's polluting, then you could crash the system. I think it also depends on how you design it. I think you could probably even increase the performance of such an MPC solution if you allow some threshold crypto happening here. So saying, okay, it's enough to have like two out of three or three out of three, I don't know.
01:19:55.874 - 01:19:57.774, Speaker A: So I think there's also some parameters.
01:19:57.902 - 01:20:05.154, Speaker B: You could be good to have. It be sort of like configurable in that way. Cool. This is a good effort here.
01:20:05.272 - 01:20:05.790, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you.
01:20:05.800 - 01:20:15.074, Speaker B: I'm impressed that you guys did this so quickly. I guess it sounds like you've been working on the research for a while, but the first GitHub commit is pretty recent.
01:20:15.202 - 01:20:22.380, Speaker A: Yeah, it was two weeks, a little bit of weekends and nights, but it was great fun.
01:20:22.990 - 01:20:24.060, Speaker B: Looks great.
01:20:28.850 - 01:21:26.942, Speaker A: We have a question from our chat, actually, which is for Artstall again, and the question is from somebody from the Pocket Network team. And the question is, will you be creating a DAP node DNP for this? And this will kind of make it easy for people to just run a node and become an operator. And how do you think about sort of getting this in the hands of people, I guess is probably the general category of this question. Yeah, I mean, right now, what we implemented, of course, it was tailored towards this hackathon. So we have what you saw on the terminal that was like a user client and then the user client hold all the logic and everything. But I think to have this, I don't know if this answers the questions, I'm just hoping I understood it right. But probably what would be best is like an operator reference implementation that just speaks the protocol forwards the messages and then you could have that standalone and then also for the client, then SDK would be the best solution.
01:21:26.942 - 01:21:54.950, Speaker A: I think that you can have like wallets separate from the actual logic because as in many, many off chain, if not all off chain solutions, there's always some watching involved. Right. I think you cannot really get around this in any solution. So the clients have to watch the operator to always when an epoch ends in a certain amount of time, sends those balance proofs. So this is like one of the security requirements here. And if the operator just goes offline, I mean, he doesn't need to be malicious. Could be a server crash.
01:21:54.950 - 01:22:44.570, Speaker A: But then it's very important that on chain the contract just someone freezes it so that the whole system stops and not then epoch progresses and suddenly everybody's out of balance proof. So this is just one of the security happening in the background. Yeah. Not sure if that answered the question though. I'll wait for Albertis to reply in the chat in 30 seconds when he gets to hear the last half of the lag. Maybe I'll start off with a question for Tom. I think this was clarified in the demo, but in case it wasn't, is your approach specific to Matic even though the demo kind of focused on that? How does this work with respect to anywhere from other stream solutions to just overall how the problems been set up? We just did this whole thing from scratch.
01:22:44.570 - 01:23:32.700, Speaker A: Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't hear the tom. I'm so sorry. The contracts current are 100% based towards Matic network. But in terms of the kind of requirements for an L2 solution, all it needs is that it can deploy. All that requires is that a withdrawal can only be claimed by a specified address and that it takes a given action on main net to claim that actively. If those two are satisfied, then it's fine.
01:23:32.700 - 01:25:01.894, Speaker A: It can be pretty easily extended to cover that L2. Got it. I was going to say not to kind of put Stannie on the spot, but kind of ask for the thing you just kind of recommend in the previous group with respect to the layer two settlement, I guess the settlement operator issue. Do you think there are any other approaches to kind of helping address that or sort of compared to that in Liquid L2? Where does that sort of lie in your understanding of how credit markets can be used for this? Yeah, I think it was the liquid L2 solution is pretty interesting because kind of like you practically have the depository or the liquidity in layer one. And practically it seems that you could actually hop from, let's say from one layer two back to layer one, but also probably I don't know, was the plan also to kind of like hop from one layer two to another layer two and become kind of like a layer three in some sense. How does it work, let's say because if you have the liquidity, let's say in Mainnet but let's say if you want to go to another layer you have to kind of go first l one and then another l two and do this kind of like a detour probably. Yeah.
01:25:01.894 - 01:26:37.590, Speaker A: Going from one layer two to another layer two isn't as nice because you do need to kind of bounce through layer one. Either we would need to kind of give the lenders or like some relay network a kind of assigned transaction that authorizes them to kind of take funds from a given vault and then kind of automatically draw that loan and then send it to another layer two. Yeah. So there could be some scope for kind of some standardized format of the user kind of announcing, okay, I am doing a withdrawal, and this is what I want to do with the funds once they arrive. And then kind of that action being performed, like, possibly through something like Gelato finance once the credit limit is high enough. Got it. One thing I was actually interested in a lot when I was kind of like also looking at this is that you have to run a node right of each of the layer two or you don't have to the fraud proofness of the exit.
01:26:37.590 - 01:28:28.358, Speaker A: So currently we have a subgraph that runs on the matic chain so a lender can kind of watch for any withdrawals on that and then they can kind of check against the ethereum mainnet, see if they've been claimed already. If it's in the subgraph and you trust that that subgraph is going to be truthful and you have a main net connection you should be kind of relatively safe as a lender. But there does need to be that kind of aspect of watching both chains. You can't just sit on mainnet and kind of do this automatically. This is true for matic. It would probably be relaxed for something like optimistic roll ups because for matic the first time that something arrives on main net is once you're actually claiming those funds when there's something with like a challenge period where you could possibly kind of see whether a withdrawal is in progress on Mainnet. For optimistic roll up you could kind of possibly build that into the protocol so that when you kind of create a loan you are going off and checking that this thing exists which would kind of reduce the kind of risks of being a lender and possibly allow some sort of pooled kind of lending kind of funds.
01:28:28.358 - 01:29:17.642, Speaker A: Because currently the minute a lender, if they aren't paying attention they could kind of make bad loans very easily. Yeah. But I kind of see this interesting when there will be more liquidity in other layers, let's say if you have a uniswap swap or something like that that you could actually use this to pull liquidity into that swap from, let's say, three different layers on, let's say, less liquid token and so forth. It probably opens pretty interesting use cases in the future. Yeah, awesome. So we are running a little bit behind schedule, so I may have to kind of cut this off now. But for any other questions, we'll just redirect you the question direct to the team.
01:29:17.642 - 01:29:59.494, Speaker A: So I want to thank both Tom and Perunt team for presenting. And with that, we are ready to move on to our next section. What I'm going to do now is sort of just going to give her judges a small break and we'll do that by doing something else in parallel. And that is there's a lot of sponsors that are also giving out prizes for the best use of their protocols. And we asked a handful of them to make a video for them to announce the prize. So you'll be kind of finding out who won what prize from each of these companies. And while these videos play for the next seven minutes, I'll give that time for our judges to get some coffee or relax or just take a quick break.
01:29:59.494 - 01:30:38.718, Speaker A: So we'll have Ave protocol apps USDC, Uma, Teller Economy, 1inchh and Vega. Come on and just announce their winners over video. And we'll just kick off that video right now. So let's jump in. Oh, ETH Global, we're really happy to announce the winners of the Ave prize. And before we announce the actual winners, we just like to say that some honorable mentions to the following that didn't win prizes, but we really love the idea. The first honorable mention was stake legends.
01:30:38.718 - 01:31:08.762, Speaker A: We really liked what that team was building. Then also ethereum yield curve. We really like what you're building as well. Okay, so for the prizes for third prize of 1500 Adai is Whirlpool. So congratulations to Whirlpool. For the second prize, which is 2500 Adai, it's Osmosis. And for the first prize of 4000 adai, it's liquid.
01:31:08.762 - 01:31:35.430, Speaker A: L two. So thanks once again to everyone that hacked on the Ave Protocol and submitted entries. We really loved them and would really recommend everyone, including the prize winners and the honorable mentions, to apply for an Ave grant because we'd love to support just these sorts of projects that everyone was building in the hackathon. So, yeah, thanks once again and we look forward to seeing how these projects evolve.
01:31:38.170 - 01:32:04.058, Speaker B: Hello everyone. I'm Molly McKinley from Protocol Labs, and I'm here to announce the winners of the three Protocol Labs prizes for ETH online. Huge thank you to everyone who submitted projects. There were some really amazing ones and big thanks to Eva and Mike for their help judging on this. Okay, so first to our third place prize. At 500 die each. We had four winners signchain Hay, Chasm, Astral, Dow and ipdb.
01:32:04.058 - 01:32:49.930, Speaker B: So congratulations to these four teams. We're super excited about the work that you're building on top of filecoin. The work with groups like Slate and Fleek and Ceramic, working with Drand and building cool ways to bring Drand to ETH smart contracts. Awesome use of DIDs, NFTs and Geodata and making Lapida P and textile threads useful and even more context through databases. So we're psyched about the work you're doing and congratulations. Next, for our runner up prize at two K Die, our winner is Audit Protocol, which is a really streamlined accounting and audit cycle. We really were impressed by the slick UI and retrieval UX flow, the use of powergate, and just how useful this looks to many, many different groups in the ecosystem.
01:32:49.930 - 01:33:20.354, Speaker B: Very approachable. We're psyched about what you're doing. And finally, our first place prize at 4K Die. The winner is Mayel an Enhanced Retrieval Payment Experience on filecoin. We think this hits a really clear need in the filecoin retrieval process, and we're really excited for the improvement for miners so that they can kind of leverage the filecoin that they have in payment channel Vouchers so that they can keep growing and onboarding new storage. So thanks for the awesome enhancement to the ecosystem. Huge congrats to these winners.
01:33:20.354 - 01:33:28.780, Speaker B: Thank you so much for all of the work you've done over the past month in ETH Online. We're jazzed to be a part of this and helping sponsor. Thanks.
01:33:37.980 - 01:34:15.344, Speaker A: Hi. This is Pete from USDC. We have three prizes. 4000 USDC for the Best Tech, 2500 USDC for the runner up, and 1500 USDC for the third place. And the best tech prize goes to tonic, refreshing Money by Tony. And the second place is Liquid l Two by Tom in for the third place, Tides Guest Fever by Flavio. Thanks everyone for participating.
01:34:15.344 - 01:34:48.752, Speaker A: There were lots of great projects and honestly, we're really impressed by almost every project. Have a great Halloween everyone, and see you next time. Hi, I'm Clayton. I'm the head of community at Uma. I'm excited to announce that Yield Scam has taken first prize for Uma in the hackathon and will win $3,000 worth of Uma tokens. Excited to see this product continue to be built. It is an AMM that specifically services expiring tokens on Uma.
01:34:48.752 - 01:35:15.988, Speaker A: So congratulations, guys. Thanks. Hi, guys. It's Mike Zemros of Teller. I'm here to happily announce the winners of our hackathon prizes at ETH Online. The categories we had were best implementation of Teller, most creative use of Teller and best original project using Teller. So the winner for best implementation goes to xliquidity.
01:35:15.988 - 01:35:59.080, Speaker A: Xliquidity is a liquidity protocol where users can deposit their assets and then they get to share in the profits from arbitrage. It uses Teller to check for accurate arbitrage opportunities. The winner for most creative use goes to samaj. SAMAGE is a social networking app that demonstrates a cool UX feature which is to allow users to interact with the DAP and pay gas fees using any ERC 20 token. Really convenient. And it uses Teller to fetch the price of those ERC 20 tokens. And finally the best original project using Teller goes to BlocksAt.
01:35:59.080 - 01:36:39.088, Speaker A: BlocksAt is creating Oracle for NASA satellite data and it's using Teller to provide the price of financial assets at the time of an event recorded via satellite. Things like wildfires and solar flares and maybe aliens. So really cool stuff. And that's it for our prizes. On behalf of the Teller team I'd like to say congratulations to you guys who won and thank you so much for all the other projects that made submissions. Cheers. Hey everyone, this is aniket here from team Biconomy.
01:36:39.088 - 01:37:23.030, Speaker A: Over the last couple of weeks we have seen so many awesome hacks built on Biconomy and honestly it was really hard to pick the best ones. The two hacks we picked met all the criteria that we listed for the hackathon and more importantly we do see these projects moving forward post hackathon. The first hackathon that we picked and we are awarding thousand dollar as Patua that is making a decentralized wallet for Indian users. Another second hack that we are picking and again awarding thousand dollar as United Community that is building a social token distribution platform and using Biconomy to make the experience. I mean we wish all the projects best of luck and also want to thank ETH Global for organizing such an awesome event. Thank you.
01:37:27.000 - 01:37:53.688, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. I'm Jess, and I work on 1inchh and 1inchh. Had a really incredible time judging all you ETH online hackers. So much so that we ended up with a three way tie for second place of 1000 die each. As well as a very deserving first place hack of 2000 die. So of the three way tie, first we have Tenderize by Nico Adam hey hey. Marco and Kevin.
01:37:53.688 - 01:38:50.850, Speaker B: They created a project that combines staking and protocols such as Live Peer Keep the Graph news cipher with automated market making to create a liquid staking solution. Next we have Yeti Roll by Amadeo and Luke who created a decentralized payrolling platform that integrates one inch to pay employees in whatever asset they so choose. And last of the three way tie we have Dpay by Sebastian who created an all in one crypto payment processor that utilizes mooney swap, liquidity pools. And of course in first place of 2000 die we have ERC Graph by Pablo. ERC graph is a real time and historic, very beautiful graph showing ERC 20 transfers across the ethereum network. And of course 1inchh is a baby of an ETH Global hackathon just over a year ago. So we're super stoked on what all you guys have to keep doing.
01:38:55.550 - 01:39:27.426, Speaker A: Hi it's Barney here from Vega. Super excited to announce the winners of our ETH Online hackathon prizes. Just to recap, we were looking for creative and interesting uses for the rich data feeds that come from the Vega testnet and I'm happy to say this community really didn't disappoint. We've had tons of engagement over on Discord and already worked lots of the feedback we've received into our plans. But now it's time to pick some winners. We have three prizes for teams that built on vega, a grand prize of $3,000 for the overall best submission, 1500 for the runner up, and 500 for third place. In third place is the blockhead team.
01:39:27.426 - 01:40:10.094, Speaker A: With their wallet trading front end and vega trading visualization, the team loved the idea behind bringing all of these things together and are excited to see this project get developed further to support more of the Vega protocol. Second place goes to the wonderfully, creative and, I have to be honest, slightly ominous sounding darth Vega. This had hands down the best name of any submission and some of the ideas the team had to develop it further. Sound awesome. I'll definitely be watching this one. And last but definitely not least, first prize goes to the incredibly resourceful Bitcoin Bill, who's managed to extract a wealth of interesting data from the Vega blockchain and make it super accessible. The Whale View and Winners and Losers pages are great, but what clinches it for me and really impressed the team was the graph showing the amount of liquidations that would happen at every price level, something you just can't do on a centralized exchange.
01:40:10.094 - 01:40:35.514, Speaker A: And that's it. I want to thank everyone for participating and making ETH online awesome. And encourage everyone to keep hacking. See you all on the Vega Discord server. Awesome. Well, that was some of our amazing sponsors sharing who won some of their prizes. We also have a whole list of other sponsors that are going to be disclosing their winners just after the demos end.
01:40:35.514 - 01:41:11.378, Speaker A: And I'll kind of be walking through who those projects are. And as a quick note for all the teams, if you heard your name, as one of the prize winners, we'll just connect you directly with each of the companies after the event, over email and discord. So just stay a little bit more patient and we'll get you your prizes ASAP. So with that, we are ready to move on to our second half of the remaining six projects for the demos. And the next category we have is our favorite DeFi. We have three protocols here that will be presenting their projects. So first we have stop loss finance, then we have flashbank.
01:41:11.378 - 01:41:56.364, Speaker A: And then we have protect protocol. So all three projects will be coming on and showing their demo, and then we'll kind of do the same round of Q A and feedback with our judges. So without further ado, I'd like to welcome Stoploss and I'll have them kick off with their so there we go. Yeah. Hi. This is Adrian from stopplots. I'm so excited to present for the finally, the team is Nathan and myself.
01:41:56.364 - 01:42:14.756, Speaker A: I built the product and Nathan helped me with design and project management. So I've been involved in Ethereum for quite a. Long time. I built a DeFi product that was called Variable and Unconstituted derivative exchange. That's where I met Nathan and after two years in infra and DevOps, I am back building on Ethereum. It has been so much fun. The tools are so great.
01:42:14.756 - 01:43:07.392, Speaker A: So we've seen this past year and even more seeing centralized services are starting to being replaced by protocols. Whether it's exchange, lending, insurance, derivatives, every primitive from the traditional finance is being implemented as protocols, as decentralized protocols. It's so exciting and we are trying to do that with stop loss. We want to bring take profit orders and stop loss orders to decentralized finance for the hack. For Ether Nine we build stop loss orders on top of uniswap that acts as insurance against impermanent loss. So impermanent loss really quickly is the fact that when you provide liquidity to uniswap you can have trading against the market and you can suffer some loss. So with stop loss you set a maximum amount of impermanent loss you're ready to take when provided liquidity.
01:43:07.392 - 01:43:46.656, Speaker A: And if your liquidity position is too close to this threshold, you get liquidated by liquidators that are incentivized to do that. So really quickly we have a factory that creates stop loss pools that are linked to unitswap, pairs and the pool stores the LP tokens of users as well as their stop loss orders. So now let's get to the demo. We are on coven. We have access to four liquidity pools dai, USDC, USDT and WBTC with ETH. So I'm going to connect as Alice, that is the user. You can see that she has some USDC.
01:43:46.656 - 01:44:19.100, Speaker A: For instance, we can go onto the Uniswap pool. Here we see that it is live. I just could swap some USDC for fake Ether. All these tokens are deployed for uncovan, right? So here she won't make a swap. She will provide liquidity to the USDC fake ether pool through stop loss and create a stop order at the same time. So here, let's say she wants to provide 600 USDC as liquidity in the pool, but not lost everything. So let's say for instance, set a 530 guarantee.
01:44:19.100 - 01:44:57.224, Speaker A: She does just that. And so here what happens is that she sends 600 USDC to the stop loss contract that transform that into LP and at the same time store the stop loss orders. So we'll just wait for the transaction to be mined. We'll see that she has a guarantee of 530 USDC. Of course, the demo day, it won't work otherwise no fun. Okay, that's really the case. Okay, I'm really sorry.
01:44:57.224 - 01:45:32.384, Speaker A: It's a new user. So one more transaction we need to approve the token. I'm really sorry about that, but let's do the exact same stuff. So yeah, again, what we are doing here is that we are providing liquidity to the uniswap pair and at the same time we set a 530 guarantee. So now let's go to the managed section. It will appear at some point. But the fact is that at the beginning, you provide here, it was an old order, you provide some tokens and you get LP tokens in exchange.
01:45:32.384 - 01:46:03.000, Speaker A: So here, let's see that she provided 600 USDC. It corresponds to LP tokens. In the uniswap pair, she has a Gua warranty. And for now, the health ratio is greater than one. Because the current value is 600 USDC, it doesn't need to be liquidated. But now let's connect as a whale on Uniswap and we'll try to change the price of fake ether. So here, let's make a swap of, let's say, ten K fake ether to USDC.
01:46:03.000 - 01:46:31.290, Speaker A: By doing that, we'll change the price by 10%, and this will create impermanent loss for Alice. So basically, what it will do, we'll take again the view of Alice. So let's connect again for Alice. What happens, we'll see that the value of her position, she still has the same LP is now close to 530. The has ratio went on the one. So she can get liquidated by liquidators. Let's do that.
01:46:31.290 - 01:46:57.264, Speaker A: So now I'm connected as a liquidator. I can check using the Graph API NFC position. I see here the position of Alice. So I can liquidate it since the health factor is under one. So I'm going to do that. So the liquidator liquidates the NFC position. What happens really is that the current value is 543.
01:46:57.264 - 01:47:37.784, Speaker A: It's more than 530. So the liquidator will use this value to reimburse of the guaranteed amount to Alice, and he will receive the rest as incentivization. So here we see that he received some fake ether over time, not on time. So now let's just quickly get back to Alice view to summarize that now we see that, okay, now she has in her wallet the 530 USDC that she was promised to be guaranteed. So that's it for the demo. Our goals for the next phase is to of course, ship that on Mainet. As a product, we need two packages as a legal work on SDK and tokenization of orders.
01:47:37.784 - 01:48:00.784, Speaker A: And for the more long term, we are making a call for contributors. We want to take time to beat this and be smart thinking about layer two or the books and stuff like that. So that's it for the demo. Thank you so much. That's a super cool stop loss using Uniswap. Sure, there'll be a lot more questions, so let's kind of move on to our next demo. And that is Project Flashbank.
01:48:00.784 - 01:48:25.776, Speaker A: So, Vaibhav, whenever you're ready, feel free to share your demo. Hey, everyone. I'm Vabhav. And here I'm presenting Flashbank. We are a team from India. A bunch of guys. Everyone worked on front end, backend and smart contracts.
01:48:25.776 - 01:49:28.600, Speaker A: And we basically built something on top of compound. Compound is one of the biggest DeFi protocols. It has around a billion dollar worth of assets locked, but it does have a missing component, and that is it does not have flash loan capabilities. Flashloan is this amazing tool built first by Aave that kind of ensures that DeFi systems stay in place. It allows easy access to funds for doing liquidations arbitraging between different exchanges, hacking, harvest, finance, passing proposals on MakerDAO. So we thought, why not expose a billion dollar worth of these assets that are logged in compound to this extra yield that's available on compound. So we just built sort of really light wrapper contracts on top of compound that allow users of compound to open up their assets to Flash loans.
01:49:28.600 - 01:50:05.652, Speaker A: It's time for a field trip. So I've basically deposited five die on compound. This is on coven. It's earning a good 19.25. I'm almost a DJ, so as I deposited die, I got 210 CRI. I'll just deposit maybe let's deposit 20 of these, we'll send our transaction. So we have fixed the Flash loan fees to 0.3
01:50:05.652 - 01:50:40.940, Speaker A: for now, but that can be changed later, obviously. And this is the APY at the moment. Depending on the amount of assets logged, our transaction is confirmed as soon as our assets are into the contracts. You can see that I have some LP shares for this specific pool. I can also directly deposit Dai, and these set of contracts will internally deposit them to compound and make me the liquidity provider over here. Let me do a quick example. Flash Zone.
01:50:40.940 - 01:51:09.000, Speaker A: So it just borrows a bunch of money and gives us some fees. At the moment, the earnings are zero point $21. As soon as the transaction goes through, we'll see this number increase. Now we just have to wait for the transaction to go through. And yeah, here we go. Sweet. And now our users of Flashbank have more money than before, all the while being logged into compound.
01:51:09.000 - 01:51:51.270, Speaker A: What we plan on doing next is obviously launch on Mainet. We are also getting up for a proposal on compound to add the stuff natively so that it's less gas costs for the people. We also want to explore flash mints. There is one bullet missing here that we also intend to create, a sort of generic Flash loan lib. It will internally borrow assets from Aave Dydox later compound and give it to the user so they don't have to integrate specific protocols. Yeah, that's about it. Thank you so much.
01:51:51.270 - 01:52:20.530, Speaker A: Looking forward to questions. Amazing. Thank you so much. It's just amazing to see that in three weeks, people have extended existing protocols, let alone unlock a billion dollars in a creative way. So I'll leave my comments for the Q A part. And with that, we have our last demo for the DeFi category, and that is Corbin with Protect Protocol. So whenever Corbin you're ready, feel free to share.
01:52:20.530 - 01:53:01.470, Speaker A: Hi guys. So I'm Corbin calling in here from the US. And I built protect protocol as part of the ETH online hackathon. So Protect Protocol is a new insurance protocol for DeFi that focuses on being open and composable. So just as on Uniswap, you can create a spot market for any token, anybody can do this for any token. With Protect, you can create a liability market on top of any DeFi protocol or any smart contract. So that could be the amount of Dai and compound, that could be a multi SIG wallet, any type of smart contract that holds value, you can create a liability market on top of it.
01:53:01.470 - 01:53:50.344, Speaker A: In my day job, I work with a lot of institutional traders that are looking at deploying more capital into the DeFi ecosystem. But their biggest restraint right now is just the risk of underlying smart contract bugs or admin keys getting compromised, right? They hear about the Harvest Finance hack, they hear about the BZX hack, they hear about Black Thursday, and they're nervous to deploy even more capital into the space. And so I think protect solves that. In the US. We have the FDIC that ensures all deposits on bank account. And I think DeFi needs a protocol, peer to peer protocol to do something equivalent to that ensure deposits into these awesome new financial projects. Protect's kind of designed as a generic version of the Aave safety module or the maker backstop.
01:53:50.344 - 01:54:27.428, Speaker A: It differs from existing solutions in that it's completely open. So anybody can create a liability market on top of any capital pool. Cover is never bought. You basically wrap any kind of pooled asset and fees are extracted block by block from that wrapped asset. The way DeFi should work on the other side of the market, you have shield miners or stakers that deposit capital and assume the liability of the underlying smart contract. And then lastly, Protect has a configurable claims process. So today most insurance products in DeFi are governed by a Dao.
01:54:27.428 - 01:55:08.560, Speaker A: But with Protect, it can be covered by a Dao or it can be covered by automated smart contract rules that query the underlying capital pool and see if kind of any kind of hack or any type of exploit has taken place. So it differs from anything that's on the market today. So this is protect. Quick note, I forked the Urine Finance so you can probably recognize some of the design. I have an example of three different Protect contracts sitting on top of compound, on top of Uniswap, on top of Aave. You can see how fees are extracted for each market. You can see the staked asset that backs each one of these capital pools.
01:55:08.560 - 01:55:43.376, Speaker A: And when you drill into it, we want to explain exactly what you're getting coverage for, how claims work. This is a type of it's almost like a legal contract. So there's more to this than just entering in one of the sides. We want to really explain what you're getting, but you can get protection right here if you're an insurance seeker. And then you can stake and start earning rewards if you're a Shield miner. The way this works is if you want to set it up, you can create a protect contract here in the upper right hand corner. So I'm going to show you a little bit of how this works on the back end.
01:55:43.376 - 01:56:44.628, Speaker A: And the smart contracts that I created, I'm going to go ahead and start deploying them too to a local network. So if you contact Protect protocol and you want to set one up, the way this works is we have kind of like a two sided token model where anybody that's buying coverage mints what we call a P token. In this case, you would be wrapping CDI from Compound and minting PCDI. PCDI has all the same properties as CDI, except it's now covered if the underlying capital pool on Compound was hacked. And by doing that, you are giving up some of your comp rewards to the stakers for that protection. On the other side of the market, you have the shield token where folks can stake ETH or they can stake a stablecoin like Dai or USDC and they're assuming the liability of this underlying market for anyone that has a P token. One of the really interesting things about this protocol is the fee model.
01:56:44.628 - 01:57:36.260, Speaker A: So how you extract fees from those that are buying coverage is configurable and so is the claims process. So like I mentioned before, the claims process can be governed by a Dow or can be governed just by smart contract rules. All that's done through deploying scripts I have over here. So you can see, you can customize the claims manager the fees, and then lastly, the capital that's sitting in the staking pool can be invested in any kind of other DeFi strategy. Right? So these folks are staking ETH that can be reinvested in another lending protocol or put into a market maker and start earning fees. So you can see I have this all running locally and we're starting to reach out to different DeFi protocols and different other capital pools to see who wants to get coverage. So thanks so much for your time and appreciate any feedback.
01:57:36.260 - 01:58:03.276, Speaker A: Amazing. Thanks, Corbin. I'll at this point ask all three teams to sort of turn your cameras on and we'll kind of jump into A-Q-A flash. Loans, stop loss orders, insurance. I think we're going to have a lot of stuff to talk about. So I will leave myself out of this whole equation and I'll let everybody else chime in. This is awesome.
01:58:03.276 - 01:58:50.904, Speaker A: I really loved all three of these projects. I have a question for Corbin. So these liquidity pools, these sort of like the collateral that is backing these contracts, how are you going to bootstrap that? What's the incentive for people to dive in, to be like a first mover? Yeah, that's a great question. So if you look at the way it works today, ave just released their safety module. If you look at what makers had on the market forever, built into some of these protocols, you basically have a pool of the protocol token that if there is some kind of hacker exploit, that pool is on the hook for the capital. Right. What I've done with Protect is basically taken that model and spread it across any type of DeFi protocol that wants to get covered.
01:58:50.904 - 01:59:33.364, Speaker A: So the way I'm bootstrapping both sides of those markets is partnering with a DeFi protocol, like, let's say it's the newest lending product that launched today, going to them and be like, hey, can you commit stakers for some X amount of capital and then start marketing this to your users to actually buy coverage? Maybe they add protocol rewards and yield farming type rewards on top of that, but get them to kind of start these different markets. And that's actually who I'm reaching out to now to see who actually wants to get covered. But it comes from the protocols themselves. What?
01:59:33.502 - 01:59:52.240, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. Also, for Protect, do you have some sort of like minimum ratio between the funds provided by kind of Shielders and the P tokens that are issued to make sure that you never run out of protection?
01:59:53.320 - 02:00:26.440, Speaker A: Yep. So, Camilla, that's a great question. And that's actually why the fee model contract. So it has the same interface for every Protect protocol or Protect contract, but the implementation can differ widely. One of my prior projects was something called DeFi Score, which is a risk appraisal and different DeFi protocols. And so not all capital pools on Ethereum are created equally. Right? Like Maker has been out there forever and so might have a lower fee and might provide coverage for a lower amount of staked capital.
02:00:26.440 - 02:00:50.436, Speaker A: Whereas the newest food token, you're going to have to have like a one to one ratio because you don't want to assume that extra liability. So based on the DeFi protocol, that fee model is configurable. And we have risks coming from DeFi score from a couple other places that actually get the fee model for the underlying lending protocol or market maker. So it's configurable by protocol. Got it.
02:00:50.458 - 02:01:15.740, Speaker B: That's smart. Thanks. I had a question for Flashbank. I actually had two questions. So the first question was just around the front end. Did you guys build all of that out yourself or did you borrow something from other places?
02:01:17.040 - 02:01:31.744, Speaker A: Yeah, we did actually build all of that during, I think, 24 hours, actually, first time for the first time ever, we had a front end guy in the team, so he did all of that goodness for us.
02:01:31.942 - 02:01:48.010, Speaker B: Well, you guys absolutely crushed it. It looks really slick, so nice job. And then I'm also curious, I saw you guys use Pocket Network, no specific question, but just kind of curious. What was your experience? Using Pocket Network? What do you like about it?
02:01:48.780 - 02:02:09.276, Speaker A: I think trailock would come in better. Yeah. So we used Pocket Network to get the stats from the smart contract and display it on the front end so it was not that hard to integrate pocket network. So it was an easy process. So there was nothing much. It was same like infuriate. Cool.
02:02:09.378 - 02:02:19.090, Speaker B: Awesome work guys. This looks really nice. I'm excited to see a real compound proposal come out of this. That'd be great. Just what we all need is more flash loans, right?
02:02:20.740 - 02:03:10.876, Speaker A: Definitely, we are on it. Thanks. I have a question for the well the stop loss. I mean it's really fascinating what you guys did with the stop loss polls and especially the managing of the positions, having the manager. That's pretty nice. Could you actually even add some sort of like a margin functionality to those kind of like positions that you have as well? What you mean by marching I didn't really understand. So basically can you add also leverage on those positions as well? Now you basically have spot orders, spot stop loss orders.
02:03:10.876 - 02:04:45.936, Speaker A: But basically that you can wrap your position that is already like pre leveraged because you already have the liquidation mechanism. So that's exactly the vision for the project. What we are focused on is stop loss and take profit and of course it comes in association with a risky bet and so for this Ethanline, the bet is liquidity providing on uniswap but it could be another strategy, it could be margin trading, it could be like leverage position and stuff like that. I think the mechanism and if there are the protocols the goal is to make liquidators and users coordinated by a protocol but we aim to do that on AMMS but on other stuff it's uniswap. Pretty simple. That's pretty cool because I could see that you could borrow that liquidity and create those kind of margin positions and it's quite interesting and about the actual kind of stop loss and I've been wondering for a while basically when order books and such why could those positions could be tokenized in that sense? So you still get a LP token right when you create the stop loss. So kind of you could create limit orders and bunch of other type of orders in tokenized form then you could actually create a place or actually even like a uniswap pool where they could be traded against.
02:04:45.936 - 02:05:34.480, Speaker A: So people could trade different kinds of positions in different whatever they have took exposure and whatever order type and they could basically trade those in between exchange exposures and that's quite fascinating. Yeah, that's actually exactly what we are thinking. First step is creating the protocol to replace what was done centralized but then the DeFi is great because you can do that. And we are working on what is the token we give to a user. It's between an option, it's a specific LP token that we are working on to really understand how it can be used but would be fun to see what it would create for the space. Yeah, exactly. And I think you guys had experience from the past.
02:05:34.480 - 02:06:12.460, Speaker A: When I remember variable one of the first projects I followed like the very early DeFi stuff. So I kind of see here the options as well because when you have the LP token you can sell it kind of like you can get rid of the exposure and trade it. So that's pretty fascinating. One thing is when you go to the main net, I really recommend to have audits and do it kind of like properly, especially if you have a good product. So it's always risky to go without any audits and so forth. Definitely, yeah, especially the Oracle and Flash loans and stuff like that. It's really risky, I think.
02:06:12.460 - 02:08:00.844, Speaker A: Yeah. And speaking of Flash, speaking of Flash loans, the flashback, I'm super happy that you guys did into the compound because I think practically now we have more liquidity to Flash borrow and do all kinds of interesting stuff. I think one interesting decision you made is that you actually made the Flashmones practically that there is fee associated, which is interesting because in Ave also we have a fee but there is protocols where you don't have a fee in Flash loans. And this is kind of something that we have had a discussion in early year, kind of like should there be a fee or should not and what's your rationale on putting this kind of like economic decision here on having fees there? So at the moment the thinking was since these contracts are not a part of compound's native contracts, so the people using these set of contracts should have some incentive to put up money over here. And if the fees is not there, I doubt that people will put up money in these pools for Flash loans. I sort of feel once these funds, once Flash loans are natively into compound, the fees should be very low or depending on compound's governance, like what we talk about on the forum, nothing at all like dYdX or something. Yeah, we haven't decided how things will work when this functionality is in compound natively.
02:08:00.844 - 02:08:03.170, Speaker A: But yeah, for now this is it.
02:08:03.620 - 02:08:12.640, Speaker B: So you're not using compound liquidity. I thought you have to have separate liquidity pools for people using these Flash loans. Specifically.
02:08:14.840 - 02:08:38.860, Speaker A: Compound users have to deposit the CDI to us or deposit to compound via us so that we can open up these assets for Flash loans to other people. Once we go through the governance protocol of compound then this functionality will be available natively and then we'll have full access to the liquidity.
02:08:39.200 - 02:08:48.168, Speaker B: And so the incentive for people to deposit their CDI in your pools would be this fee when people take out Flash loans.
02:08:48.264 - 02:09:15.764, Speaker A: Okay. Also yeah, I don't think there are a lot of other places at the moment where people can use their C tokens. So this is also one of those places. Awesome. I know it feels like it's not enough time, but that went by really fast. So if there are any other questions, we'll connect you with everybody here and we'll have the opportunity to ask you more. But congrats to all three of the DeFi teams here.
02:09:15.764 - 02:10:04.180, Speaker A: And just as a note before we leave, it is always best to not test in Prod. So make sure that if you're going to go on mainnet, you go through proper audits and we hope to kind of use your protocols ourselves, hopefully very soon. So congrats again. And with that we are ready for the last category and the last three demos for today. And this is a particular category I'm super excited about because we are clearly seeing this is an amazing pattern that our ecosystem is aiming to prioritize, building and maintaining communities. And that is the last theme that we saw within our twelve teams. So community is the next theme, and this includes any category that helps developers, projects.
02:10:04.180 - 02:10:37.570, Speaker A: Creators really sort of hone in on being able to talk and chat with who their audience is, and also, in general, make it more. Interactive for an existing protocol or an existing service that we already know to just make it more fun and invite a lot more people in through a different lateral angle. So we have three projects. Syndicate, Unite, and Space DX And I'll have all three of them kind of come in. So I believe Syndicate is ready to showcase what we've done. And I'll have Bill kind of show us the Syndicate demo. So Bill, whenever you're ready.
02:10:37.570 - 02:11:22.080, Speaker A: Hi. This is Bill and I'm from San Francisco. And this is my project syndicate. So what is syndicate? The aim for? Syndicate is to become a platform for Web Three communities. And the opportunity here is that almost all crypto native communities currently live on web two chat platforms such as Discord or Telegram. And it's a bit surprising since the users themselves are actually quite familiar with Web Three tools. So what did I built for this hackathon? What I made is essentially a web3 enabled discord.
02:11:22.080 - 02:12:31.240, Speaker A: So let's jump into the demo note here that Syndicate is actually live already and if you want to access it, just simply go to this URL. So here I'm at the site and if I press Enter here, I'm going to be prompted to sign my wallet address and I'll sign here and then as soon as you join, you should be faced with something fairly familiar. If you ever use Discord or Slack, the interface is somewhat borrowed from there. So as you can see, this is essentially a chat room and you can chat here. There are different servers or different channels rather, and then you can directly message people as well. Cool. So what makes this a little bit different from Discord? For example, for one, the user identities are actually their Web Three wallet identities.
02:12:31.240 - 02:13:45.196, Speaker A: So I do not own or have really any control over their profiles other than keeping their metadata and their unique Web Three features that are only possible when you cool chance coming in. A lot of features are only possible when you build this platform natively from Web Three. So for example, one such possibility is creating a permission chat. So here I have a chat I created called the Ave governance server. What the permission server is, is that every user that wish to join the server must hold at least one ave to join. So currently I do not meet such requirements, and when I click join server, it's not going to allow me to do so. So if I were to switch to a wallet where I do meet the requirements, so let me go to my main wallet here, it's going to automatically refresh the page, I will have to sign my signature, and voila, I'm inside the server.
02:13:45.196 - 02:14:21.070, Speaker A: And once again, this is a server where only people who hold Ava can join. And if I go back, you'll see the direct message that was sent to me earlier. And one last thing I wanted to show off is anyone can right now create a server if they wish really quickly, and then you just set the token requirements. If you want to have it, you don't need to and then just create server. There you go. Sweet. And that's kind of like a very basic demo of what I made.
02:14:21.070 - 02:15:15.016, Speaker A: So how did I build this for the web app? Basically I use Firebase for real time messaging. MongoDB currently holds the metastore data. Hopefully I plan to decentralize this data further either on the layer one or layer two blockchain front end, I use React Node, and for Web Three interactions, I just use the Web Three JS. What is next? Once again, I want to reiterate the opportunity here. Almost all communities, and we're kind of used to this, currently live on Web Two chat platforms. And I think in the future it just makes a lot more sense for us to adopt a Web Three community platform. And there are just a lot of possibilities that we don't really even think about when we're in the Web Two mindframe.
02:15:15.016 - 02:15:52.360, Speaker A: So, for example, Snapshot, something that recently became adopted, and I think it's very cool. So I hope to implement like pseudo lightweight off chain governance features into syndicate in the future as well. Yeah, there's just a lot of cool possibilities. So I think there's been a lot of great feedback already, but if you want to get in touch with me, simply go to Ethunders Glitch on Twitter. And I'm definitely looking for people to kind of work together with, namely marketing and desap people. Thank you. Awesome.
02:15:52.360 - 02:16:33.660, Speaker A: Thanks, Bill. Super cool project. Especially nice to hear that it's already live. So we'll wait a few more minutes for some Q A, but with that, let's move on to our second demo for this category, and that is the Unite community. So Alex, whenever you're ready, feel free. Show us your demote. And we met at the start of the hackathon four weeks ago.
02:16:33.660 - 02:17:35.520, Speaker A: But really it feels like we've known each other forever. Social tokens have been blowing up lately and Brian Flyn, who has his own social token, recently posed a list of questions, a big one being what are the best ways to do a social token distribution? Our team was thinking about the space, so I jumped in with the idea of giving away tokens in exchange for social media engagement. And Alex Mesmez, who tokenized himself, replied saying that he thinks it's an amazing idea. The next day, he tried my suggestion with a tweet saying that he's giving away $5 in Alex tokens to the first hundred people who retweet. He got the retweets and in 17 minutes grew the number of token holders by 25%. He added that the Twitter algo stopped him from sending DMs to the winners and he had to manually do the distribution in phases. Which brings us to Unite, a tool to automatically distribute tokens to your community and essentially automate the slow and manual process that Alex Mesmej had to go through to distribute his tokens.
02:17:35.520 - 02:18:32.680, Speaker A: It works like this first you connect your wallet and log in with MetaMask. Then you need to verify your account by signing a public tweet. We complete verification and log in. Now we're on our homepage where Alex Merced would create his first campaign. We want to offer many campaign types, including retrospective airdrops to all Twitter followers and other combinations. But now we're going to demo rewards for retweets. So we click Create Campaign and begin filling in our campaign details.
02:18:32.680 - 02:19:03.428, Speaker A: Because this is a live demo, we're going to call it Test in Prod. And then we enter the ERC 20 token address that we want to distribute. This can be any ERC 20 token as long as you have it in your wallet. Then we need to enter a Tweet URL. So we're going to create a tweet to basically match the experiment that Alex Mesmez did. So we tweet, grab the Tweet URL, paste that in, decide how many people to reward, we'll just go with ten. The number of tokens per reward will go with 100.
02:19:03.428 - 02:19:46.360, Speaker A: Then we begin two step process to send these tokens to the reward pool. First we need to allow permission to spend these tokens, these thousand Alex tokens for the campaign. We wait for that transaction to be confirmed, then we do another MetaMask transaction. And here's where we're actually creating the campaign and sending those thousand tokens to our Unite Reward Pool smart contract. So wait for that to confirm and boom, the campaign's been created. So a few moments later, Alice is on Twitter and sees Alex's tweet. She decides to retweet and get some of those sweet, sweet Alex tokens.
02:19:46.360 - 02:20:25.520, Speaker A: She then clicks the Visit Unite community link to claim her tokens. Like Alex, she has to connect her wallet and log in with MetaMask. She has to verify her Twitter account by signing a public tweet. She then completes verification and lands on our homepage in the background. Our Twitter bot has seen that she's earned the tokens because she retweeted. And boom, she sees them on the home page, those hundred Alex tokens that she got for retweeting his tweet. These are now on our smart contract in an array mapping her wallet to the number of tokens she's earned.
02:20:25.520 - 02:21:08.160, Speaker A: But she can withdraw these by clicking Withdraw, which opens up a MetaMask transaction to execute that withdrawal into her own Ethereum wallet. And we wait for that to confirm and boom. The Alex tokens are now in her wallet. Those hundred Alex tokens that she just earned for spending her social capital and participating in his campaign. She then visits his website and sees that she can join a private telegram group because she holds Alex tokens. And so she goes through this process of interacting with a bot on Telegram that opens up MetaMask and checks that she has Alex tokens. And she instantly gets access to a private telegram group for Alex token holders.
02:21:08.160 - 02:22:12.896, Speaker A: Meanwhile, Alex can see the campaign progress and see that Alice has claimed her tokens and monitor the campaign as it develops. So we were testing out our DAP and something interesting happened. People saw our verification tweets and started to try Unite for themselves, including Coin artist who has her own social token and 37,000 Twitter followers. We've already had almost 200 people sign up, many of whom have their own social tokens and are very excited to use Unite to automatically distribute tokens to their community. We're currently running on the COVID testnet, but we'll be launching on main net within the next week or so. We're focused on Twitter distribution for now, but plan on adding other platforms and also want to add functionality to let people issue and use tokens on Unite. We already showed you what it looks like to access a private telegram group by holding a token, but you could also access a token gated newsletter, or maybe get early access to concert tickets or other content by holding tokens or even exchange tokens for video calls or shout outs.
02:22:12.896 - 02:22:37.600, Speaker A: But rarely, the possibilities are endless. Thank you for your attention. We look forward to your questions and hope that you will use Unite to distribute tokens to your community. Awesome. Well, that concludes the Unite demo. And we have one last demo for the day, and that is our team number twelve. And without further ado, I'd like to welcome Space DX.
02:22:37.600 - 02:23:24.660, Speaker A: So James, take it away. Hi guys. My name is James Dawson. I am from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I've recently quit my job to pursue becoming a solidity developer, and this is my first fully completed solidity DAP. And I'd just like to say before I start, yesterday at rehearsals, I found out about a project called Dark Forest. And I'd just like to say I checked out the project and it is so cool and totally awesome and that this is my own kind of interpretation and implementation of a space economy again and hopefully you can see how they are similar and how they differ.
02:23:24.660 - 02:24:02.876, Speaker A: Without further ado, this is Spacedx. Spacedx is a high risk token economic warfare game. It is built in solidity and utilize Matic for a fast paced gaming experience. Users must travel across the galaxy exploring star systems and earning rewards or receiving punishments. Users will have to build a starfleet to protect themselves or to attack others. The game itself is currently comprised of three separate tokens solar and ERC 20 is the main currency of the galaxy. Solar is used not only to buy goods in the economy, but is used as fuel itself to travel throughout the galaxy.
02:24:02.876 - 02:24:53.644, Speaker A: Solar is mined from the cores of planets, which leads us on to our next token planets. Planets are ERC 720 ones and represent the ownership of the planet. Each planet has randomly generated traits, the most important being its yield. The yield is essentially the interest that you'll be paid for staking solar against your planet. Our last token is an ERC 1155 called Ships and Technology or SATS for short. SATS essentially make up your space fleet as space is a very dangerous place and you'll need to protect yourself and more importantly, protect your planets. Users who stake solar against planets should also deposit SATS to protect the planets from attackers, as the planets mine them profit, as any other user can attack the planet.
02:24:53.644 - 02:25:28.940, Speaker A: And if they are successful, they will have access to the planet's profits, taking your hard earned solar. And that is essentially how the game's economy works in its current state. The last thing I'd like to cover is exploration. Users can explore the galaxy to discover planets, SATS and whatever else they can find. The user will have to spend solar to warp the new star locations. Burning supply. The galaxy is currently made up of 640,000 systems that can be explored with the hope in the future to make the expansion of the game decentralized and run by governance.
02:25:28.940 - 02:26:02.040, Speaker A: When a user arrives at a star system location, they will trigger a random event which will be tokenized. The token is then burned by the user to receive the reward or punishment and users will grow the cosmos as they explore it. That will take us onto the demo. So I'll just quickly show you. This is the front end and the current implementation that I've done so far. This is the star map. You can choose your quadrant that you want to move to your sector district and then you pick a star.
02:26:02.040 - 02:26:38.032, Speaker A: So this is an undiscovered star location. So we will explore this together. Oh no user in the way. And as you can see, we're connected to the Matic Mumbai network here, so we'll just do this together. So this will move my address and all of my ships to the well, it sets my ships and my address to this star location. And I'll set that there has been a new planet discovered at this star location. So if we go over to our dashboard here, we'll go down and see our new planet and we'll have to deploy this planet.
02:26:38.032 - 02:27:15.456, Speaker A: So we will do that together. So each planet has its own contract that can have solar and SATS or ships and technology deposited to it. And the owner of the ERC 721 token can have access to withdraw the tokens themselves. Hopefully that goes through Ha. And here we have where you would deposit SATS. You can see that the planet's yield is 12%. It has a minimum stake period of 14 days.
02:27:15.456 - 02:27:50.250, Speaker A: We'll just quickly invest some solar here into the planet and I'll finish with that. Attacking is the last element of the game, which unfortunately has not been developed within this month. But I'll be working on the game in the future to incorporate a chess like strategy game, which with each sat having a unique ability on this kind of grid board. That's how I'm envisioning it right now and I think it is entirely possible using matic. And that has just went through. Yeah. So thank you very much.
02:27:50.250 - 02:28:18.580, Speaker A: Incredible. Thanks for that. Amazing demo, James. I'd like to kind of just ask all three projects to kind of turn their cameras on and we'll kind of do a short Q and A here. One thing that kind of amazed me was when yesterday I found out that this was James's first time just working in Web Three and not only did he make an amazing game, but he was able to sort of get all of us excited. So congrats. Cheers.
02:28:18.580 - 02:28:54.930, Speaker A: I'm just going to dive in because this is probably selfishly the most relevant category to me. It's kind of amazing. I feel like I would just use all of these projects for myself and I would definitely push them into my broader category of social tokens or community tokens. I just have a couple of thoughts and maybe a couple of questions. Syndicate amazing. It's so easy. Obviously I love discord and collab land and all that, but it's still kind of a clunky experience.
02:28:54.930 - 02:29:48.690, Speaker A: You have to go to this website and connect. The thing I love about Web Three is just connect wallet and you're good to go. But with that said, you're going up against a fairly large competitor that is pretty well developed and well funded and all that. I assume you have plans to add more rich media photos, et cetera. How do you plan to tackle that? Is it more kind of just the open source come and join me kind of approach or are you building a company around this? What's that like? Yeah, a very good question. Like you said, I think going adopting Web Three into communities, currently there's kind of like the two approaches, which is one is you build your own platform. One is you kind of use extensions onto existing platforms and I think they both have pros and cons.
02:29:48.690 - 02:31:33.744, Speaker A: Obviously on top of existing platforms, you kind of leverage what they already have and then I kind of see the future for Web three adoption moving towards something, eventually having their own platforms. So to me this is more of like a longer term ambition and I think as the features kind of add on, it can hopefully kind of snowball into features that build on top of each other onto like it's an independent platform. But that's a really good point. I think the initial adoption will probably come from extensions onto existing platforms and then as people kind of as certain things are just harder doing it through extensions, for example. I think Snapshot is one of the innovators in creating their own platform where the community actually lives on that instead of Web Two platforms, simply because something like that is really hard to build into as an extension. And that could definitely be something I also incorporate into syndicate as kind of an early way to adopt users. But yeah, my ambition is definitely longer term thinking, maybe build up a team of people who want to work on this together and just still very early on in my eyes, it's very cool.
02:31:33.744 - 02:32:38.076, Speaker A: I just have another question for Unite specifically. It's funny because this has actually got somebody sent me this link yesterday and I've been looking at it because we've been looking at different ways to basically get more users. For my own token, I'm still unsure of the right model for it. Maybe Retweets isn't the right model for me, but it sounds like you're thinking of different ways to sort of reward people for social engagement. I see four of those. But I'm kind of wondering, I don't know if you've had time to think about this a couple of years in advance, but what's sort of the craziest idea of how to reward users that you've had kind of just diving into this? Yeah, that's a great question. So right now we've been focused on Twitter and there's crypto, you know, that makes sense for now, but I think these sorts of tokens will go mainstream.
02:32:38.076 - 02:33:32.844, Speaker A: And one crazy idea that plays into some of our longer term thinking is you could have a sports team issue a token and do something like when people go to a game, maybe the first game you go to, you get 100 tokens, the second you get 200 tokens. And then you build a streak. You lose that streak when you stop going to games or participating. You get tokens when you participate in their social media. But you could do something like reward tokens for people who post selfies wearing the jersey, for example, where that would be difficult to verify using a bot like we are currently. But you could potentially have a system where there are human validators who are validating these sorts of actions and it becomes tricky to validate subjective things. Like is a GitHub pull request good, but you can have consensus with humans.
02:33:32.844 - 02:34:14.180, Speaker A: It's difficult for bots to do that. But yeah, I think there's some interesting far out campaigns where you couldn't do them with bots. But getting consensus among humans who are aligned economically, to be honest, is really interesting. I mean, for your particular use case, it could be yeah, people posting remixes of your songs that people are voting on and then get social tokens in exchange for them, or wearing your t shirt or post a selfie with a rack tape, that kind of thing. Yeah, absolutely. And to your point, I totally see what you're saying about if we're only giving tokens away to the top ten or something like that, that's like pretty low lift for a human to tackle. It's not like some I mean, unless you get just like this crazy amount of engagement.
02:34:14.180 - 02:34:28.904, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems a lot more manageable than just some than try to automate every single aspect of it. That's very cool. I'll leave some space for other people to come. Thanks.
02:34:29.102 - 02:34:39.950, Speaker B: I have a question for syndicate. You mentioned plans to further decentralize metadata storage. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're thinking on that?
02:34:42.320 - 02:35:39.104, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question as well. So Stanley actually got me thinking about this more. Initially I did build the metadata mainly on MongoDB just because it was fast and easy for me. But moving forward, for example, metadata is around the servers and their requirements. I can see those things being lightweight enough to be stored on the blockchain and things that people who create servers can opt into whether they want to kind of have that information live somewhere decentralized. Perhaps layer one, layer two solutions there that I will still have to dig into more. I definitely think there's possibilities there, but I will have to kind of learn more and see what makes sense the most.
02:35:39.104 - 02:35:39.712, Speaker A: Cool.
02:35:39.766 - 02:35:48.980, Speaker B: And I had sorry, one more question, if I can just sneak in here with one more but how do you plan to manage identity across different servers?
02:35:51.880 - 02:36:57.930, Speaker A: So currently your identity is your web3 wallet, basically there's been a lot of good feedback and suggestion to incorporate like ENS. So that would be a very quick way to kind of assign people names and such. Right now you can add profile images and names to your profile and that will carry over similar to Discord where it'll just carry over to different servers. But as the platform developed more, I can imagine servers having their own people having their own kind of profile per server. And definitely there's just a lot of cool possibilities. Like for example, servers can distribute NFTs as membership badges or status for the community maps. I think that already happens through extensions, but definitely would be a lot easier natively on the native Web Three platform.
02:36:58.620 - 02:37:04.364, Speaker B: This app is awesome. I love it. I'm going to start using it. I already signed up, so this is great. Really good work.
02:37:04.402 - 02:37:05.230, Speaker A: Thank you.
02:37:06.240 - 02:37:45.640, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm also super excited about these projects and potentially using them myself. So yeah, great job. First thing I'm wondering for both syndicate and Unite is how to bridge the Web Three user with the non Web Three user. So something like having your ETH address be your identity might feel pretty alienating for most people. Same with people retweeting and wanting to get tokens, but not necessarily having a MetaMask wallet on Unite. So how do you make that connection?
02:37:49.980 - 02:38:33.652, Speaker A: So, I mean, my view is that the Internet itself used to be really awkward. I remember using a dial up modem and needing to phone a number and listen to this weird song that came out of the phone and it was really awkward. And now my grandparents use the Internet, so I think people will get used to it. It seems awkward because it's not normal for us, but I think it'll be a gradual process. I don't have any great ideas on how to abstract away a MetaMask wallet. I mean, I know other teams are working on those projects and we just build on top of whatever they build. But yeah, my view is that it'll grow from early adopters who are excited about having to use something new to it, becoming normal, that adoption cycle.
02:38:33.652 - 02:39:25.290, Speaker A: And ultimately I think it'll be as normal as using two FA to log into your Gmail. And maybe not everyone does that, but I think enough people will do it to justify us spending a lot of time trying to turn this into a thing. Yeah, I think that's a really good point. I think as adoption grow, people will kind of get familiar with the toolings. But also I think there are several good on ramp tools. I think formatic is one thing that comes to mind where essentially you just put in your email and then it's kind of like semi custodial wallet that they generate for you, but for people who are just like onboarding this, not necessarily even for financial reasons, but for community reasons. Like I said, the initial on ramp, I think that's totally okay.
02:39:25.290 - 02:40:00.976, Speaker A: Can I add one more thing quickly? So we almost got Biconomy working for frictionless withdrawals. So one of the problems is someone sees this tweet, they know nothing about crypto and they see, oh, I can earn free things, that's cool. But they don't have an ethereum wallet, so we can solve that problem. You're going to get free stuff. You'll go through a hoop to install the Chrome extension and create a wallet, that's fine. But then to withdraw the tokens, you need ETH right, to execute that transaction to get them out of our smart contract. But we can use Biconomy, for example, or gas station network to subsidize those withdrawals.
02:40:00.976 - 02:40:50.132, Speaker A: So then all you need to do is create an account and people create accounts all the time. That can look almost like creating a new Slack account or creating a Discord account. It's awkward the first time you do it, but I think especially in our case, the incentives are there to do it and we can remove the friction by subsidizing the withdrawals and that would just be like a customer acquisition cost that the issuer would bear to create their campaign. That's pretty cool. I need to ask one interesting thing because James about the Space DX, what I've seen it's pretty extensive game. This is practically your first experience with Web Three. Yeah, just kind of teetering with little things.
02:40:50.132 - 02:41:55.896, Speaker A: I was a software engineer before but I've just recently taken the transition into Solidity and stuff, basically. How did you find was it difficult to get on boarded and understand everything? I mean with the couple of weeks? No. Well I've been tinkering with different projects I was tinkering with didex before this and different exchanges and stuff and I just wasn't really satisfying the kind of what I wanted to do, I don't know. So and then I just decided I wasn't really very interested in the games on blockchain at the time I found them just wasn't very interesting. And then I just started messing with ERC 720 Ones and then all of the Staking for NFTs came about and I got quite interested in that and then that kind of triggered this idea that this economy based game so it was just been tinkering with little things. But this is like the first complete front end to smart contract kind of application that I've made. Awesome.
02:41:55.896 - 02:42:07.340, Speaker A: So we are running out of time, so I want to keep the show going. Maybe if there's any last questions, I'll kind of open that up and we'll just make sure that the answers are hopefully short and quick.
02:42:07.490 - 02:42:24.850, Speaker B: I had one I just wanted to ask everybody and first of all, just thank you guys, all these have been fantastic. But I just wanted to ask everybody kind of like what was your favorite thing about the hackathon? It sounds like some people made a lot of friends along the way. Maybe you learned something but just love to hear about what you guys liked about.
02:42:27.640 - 02:43:03.242, Speaker A: It. Yeah, well, I enjoyed having the kind of deadline and pushing myself to work and having people to talk to and who are in the same boat as me. I thought that was great and really motivated myself to really get something finished and out the door. Yeah. Also just having a schedule is super helpful. Especially it can be challenging if people are not in the street full time. Having some sort of accountability is great.
02:43:03.242 - 02:43:44.230, Speaker A: And also just bringing the community together. I think it can be sometimes hard to everyone's kind of scattered everywhere and just like a great opportunity to kind of have everyone together. Sure, yeah, I'd say we made a lot of friends, at least for myself, I made a lot of friends. I didn't know these guys three and a half weeks ago and now they feel like real friends, even though we've never met in real life. And not just the guys on our team, but a whole lot of really interesting people who we met through the discord and through people reaching out. And it's been amazing. Amazing.
02:43:44.230 - 02:44:39.110, Speaker A: That's a wonderful note to sort of end today's twelve demos. So I want to thank all three of you, all three projects for kind of showing us everything, especially live. The best thing about all twelve of these things is that they are almost ready and most of them already are available on main net. So this kind of just brings it and makes it a lot easy for us to sort of see that the bridge from ideation to using in production is very small and it keeps on improving and getting shorter. So this is something that I personally get super excited about. So with that said, not just the team, I also want to thank our four judges and I want to be extremely respectful of their time and sort of all of their comments and feedback they've given. They've sort of made it a lot more possible for all of us to sort of enjoy and propagate the space to a lot more people outside of the developer ecosystem.
02:44:39.110 - 02:45:07.426, Speaker A: And this is something that I want to make sure that I thank all of you here directly. So thank you so much to all twelve teams. Thank you so much to Ashley, Stannie, Camila and Andre. We really appreciate this. And to all of the hackers, everybody who participated, congrats on demoing and submitting and showing what everybody else what you've done. So I do want to wrap this up. I need like two more minutes for all of this thing.
02:45:07.426 - 02:45:40.590, Speaker A: And what I'll do is I'll kind of just run through everything I want to say. This was a massive event from our side. We had $125,000 in prizes just given up for the event and there were so many teams sort of eligible for these projects. So we kind of showed you about seven and eight videos earlier today from some of our sponsors. But we have a lot more of the sponsors who are announcing their prizes for the first time. I will quickly just scroll through these slides. But what we will be doing is we'll be tweeting this out and connecting you with all the companies directly and all the team members.
02:45:40.590 - 02:46:22.358, Speaker A: You'll find out what prizes you've won. So with that, here are the Zero, X and audience winners. We have Balancer and Bloom winners here, so you should be able to pause. It would help me move on super quickly here. Ceramic and chainlink winners are the teams here and Compound and ENS winners are listed here. Then we have Gnosis and keep then Matic and Marlin then Mstable and near opengsn and open pocket network and pull together winners there's a lot of projects on this category. Then we have Portis and Raiden API winners.
02:46:22.358 - 02:46:58.774, Speaker A: We have reach and teller winners. Textile and the Graph. Uma and urine finance. And that's all of our sponsors. So before we kind of wrap this up and sort of go jump into our Impact Summit, I want to just take a few minutes and just really thank everybody who made this possible. This has been a massive production, and it's not just the 700 hackers or the 2600 attendees that have watched the Summits, but it's also the judges, the speakers, all the sponsors, the mentors, and the volunteers that have made this possible. And there's way too many people to thank here.
02:46:58.774 - 02:48:01.210, Speaker A: So I just want to show that these are all the people that were behind the scenes helped out in making this event an amazing success. So, first of all are our judges, and then we had all these speakers who contributed to a lot of the talks over the past five summits. And I want to just recognize all of them for giving us their time and being available to not just talk with anybody who had questions for them, but also really help make this easy for others to sort of feel comfortable and get into this ecosystem. Then I want to thank all of our sponsors who not only just helped make this event success from being there as an API provider, but also for lending out their teams to help all of our attendees and developers really sort of get unblocked in any problems that they may have had. And lastly, some of our mentors who are officially there to help address technical issues, run some workshops, and make everybody to understand what they can do and cannot do and give ideas to projects. So I want to thank all of them. And then lastly, a handful of our volunteers that helped us out with our judging process.
02:48:01.210 - 02:48:44.226, Speaker A: And we're super thankful for their support because we did paralyze a lot of things and we did a lot of things that we hadn't done before as a team. And this is kind of how all of that was pulled off. And last but not least, I want to thank the ETH Global team. There's eight of us that make the ETH Global team that kind of help with all these events. So I want to, first of all, thank Trent for owning all of our marketing and social media and sort of being the face on, being the first point of contact and really kind of making sure that everything we want to do at Eight Global reaches the audience we care about. The next up is Emily. She has been, I'm sure, in touch with all of you as hackers and participants.
02:48:44.226 - 02:49:36.082, Speaker A: She manages all of the. Attendee and hacker experience for our online events and she's been extremely crucial to our team's success. And I want to give a big round of applause to Emily and Trent there. Andrew, everything you've seen on the Zoom and the productions that we've pulled off in our speakers and our workshops, andrew has been behind all of that and we would not get the quality that we have at these events and the production value that we would without Andrew's help and support. Next up, a lot of you already know Jacob from being the liaison for all of our partnerships and our companies, and Jacob's really kind of the one ensuring that every hacker has a great experience and every sponsor and every mentor is plugged into all of our attendees. And I want to thank Jacob for all of that. Next up, we have Josh.
02:49:36.082 - 02:51:00.066, Speaker A: Josh really kind of keeps all of us in check and I want to really kind of give him a special shout out for really making sure that all these events down to planning on all the summits, he was a big key player in getting all of that figured out for us and executing with that plan. And Josh, we thank you for everything you've done there. Next up, we have Liam, who has kind of helped ensure that all of our systems are up and running down to everything you've done on the charging pages, to how we did applications, how we manage all of our communications. Liam's support in kind of making all of this work super smoothly and helping out with automations and just really high level planning on what we need to do as a team has just been a big piece in getting all of this together, put together. And lastly, Heather, who sort of is in charge of all of the experience for our attendees and events. Everything you've kind of seen anywhere from the little touches to how we can keep everybody in check and the constant messages I get to make sure everything happens on time, kind of the work and the effort and the attention detail that goes into all of this thing is all thanks to Heather. So I want to thank Heather and everybody else on our team for making all of that possible for you to experience a really smooth online experience and hopefully offline very soon.
02:51:00.066 - 02:51:58.214, Speaker A: So we had twelve teams present to all of us and we kind of call them finalists. But if you've been to any global event before, one thing that we kind of like to highlight is that these events are not structured as competitions. We really want them to be a place for everybody to experiment and sort of not be in a competitive environment, to be able to game things or not try out what they wanted to do and really focus on learning. So when we kind of call somebody a finalist, that actually is our way of saying that everybody is in that capacity a winner that is equivalent to the first place for us. And what we're doing, other than any teams that are eligible for any sponsor prizes, is that everybody who presented today will be receiving one ETH per team member and that is the reward for all of our finalists. So this is a few thousand dollars for every team. And this is kind of our way of helping you just sort of recognize all the work that you've put in.
02:51:58.214 - 02:53:01.498, Speaker A: And we really hope that you kind of continue building what you are starting and what you were able to accomplish in three weeks and just extending that a lot more. So all that said, I do want to wrap up and thank everybody for being here. We are going to start rolling into our Impact Summit, which I'll go over in a quick minute, but this would not be any global event if we kind of don't tell you about what's next. So a lot of things are still being worked out and we do have 2021 plans and a lot of them are in. Works for us to kind of publicly announce them, but we do feel comfortable really hinting that we are ready to kind of aim for ETH bogota, which will be our in person event for next year, scheduled for August 6 to Eigth. And we're super excited to do this thing in tandem with Ethereum's DevCon in Bogota. So hopefully we'll see all of you in person in Colombia in about ten months and keep an eye out on a lot of the other online events we're going to do in the next few months.
02:53:01.498 - 02:53:44.002, Speaker A: So thank you all of you for being with us, giving us your time and being up at OD times throughout the world to watch this. And with that, I am ready to sort of kick off with our Impact Summit. So we are already kind of in this whole show here. So what we're doing is we're going to talk about a lot of things that have helped make Ethereum span and propagate to other industries in this ecosystem. So we have a lot of amazing talks prepared for today. We have a capstone panel on the impact on the enterprise for Ethereum. Then we have a talk on Radical, which is helping make code collaboration easier.
02:53:44.002 - 02:54:39.570, Speaker A: We're going to talk about how we actually have been able to contribute to identity and decentralized fashion. And then we're going to move into a talk by Ronil on how crypto and blockchain are merging into the music industry and then give a really big overview of what's now actually possible with Web Three for developers. And lastly, and then we're going to bring on the UNICEF team and they're going to talk about how they're reimagining systems at a global scale with the UNICEF Impact Fund. And we're going to end today with our last talk, which is going to be a fireside chat between Vitalik Buterin and Tyler Cowan, and they're going to be talking about all things Ethereum, crypto and economics. So, without further ado, we are ready to kick off our very first talk. And it's going to be a capstone Ethereum panel. And we have Dan Shaw, Paul Brody, Karen Scarborough and Jim McCann, who are going to be talking about the industry impact in the enterprise world.
02:54:39.570 - 02:54:57.326, Speaker A: So they're all here. And with that, I'd like to welcome all of you to turn your cameras on and I will kick off with our first talk for the Impact Summit. Welcome. Hi, Kardec. Thank you very much. I'm Paul Brody. Can you hear me all right? Yes, we can.
02:54:57.326 - 02:55:15.574, Speaker A: I think we're waiting on I'm Paul Brody, I'm the global blockchain leader at EY. I'm actually going to give for the Capstone Summit. I think I'm going to start by giving a short talk and then we're going to go into the panel discussion. Sounds perfect. Anyway, yeah. So I'm Paul Brody. I'm the global blockchain leader at EY.
02:55:15.574 - 02:55:52.640, Speaker A: And I'm really delighted to be here. I have been a huge Ethereum fan for many, many years. In fact, quite a few years ago, I was the very first person to build a blockchain at IBM and we built it on the Alpha version of Ethereum. And so I have been since, I think, 2014 or so, working in and around the Ethereum space. It's been incredibly exciting. But all of that time, I have been in that capacity as a representative and a participant in a large enterprise environment. And as you can see, I've worn my best soul crushing large enterprise blue suit today.
02:55:52.640 - 02:56:47.442, Speaker A: First, I was at IBM, and then shortly after that, I went over to EY Ernst Young, which is one of the world's big audit firms and professional services firms. But I have never lost my passion for Ethereum. I've never lost my passion for blockchain. In fact, the paper I wrote at IBM was called Device Democracy because I wanted to bring the decentralized vision, the democratized vision of technology from blockchain into the world of IoT as well. And I have never kind of lost that desire to kind of properly decentralize and industrialize this technology. What I want to talk to all of you today about is why this incredibly vibrant, incredibly capable Ethereum community should invest some time and energy in not just tolerating the participation of large enterprises, but really welcoming them. And I know it's an incredibly vibrant community.
02:56:47.442 - 02:57:21.886, Speaker A: I've been watching the finalists in this hackathon all afternoon and it's been incredible. But enterprises have a lot to contribute as well. And I will argue, and I would like to argue, that it's not just that enterprises have a lot to contribute, it's that in working with enterprises, we will help to make together Ethereum to be the world's most dominant public blockchain. And that that is in and of itself a genuine public good. So let me get into the thing. I mean, I'm a corporate person. We would not be corporate people if we did not have slides to share with you.
02:57:21.886 - 02:58:16.110, Speaker A: And so let me share with you some slides because that's what we do. So let me talk about embracing Ethereum and the enterprise in order to make Ethereum and the enterprises more successful together, the Internet has created a winner take all economy. Now, I feel like I've been around forever in the world of Internet, but this is the kind of the world that we live in. The Internet has rewarded scale and network effect and the result has been a really substantial centralization of the digital world, right? Centralized intermediaries have used the economics of software, which is that another copy costs nothing. They've used the power of network effects, right. The more participants in your network, the more valuable your network becomes. And they've used those two together, along with proprietary technology, to create vendor lock in and market dominance.
02:58:16.110 - 02:58:54.454, Speaker A: This isn't just a theory and it's not just something that's happening in Search or a couple of other industries almost across the board in heavy duty research that's been done by economists. What we found is over the last 30 years, the global economy has become more centralized, right? It has become more dominated by a smaller number of companies. Those companies are immensely profitable and they're also immensely powerful. And what I would argue is that it does not have to be that way. Software and technology does not have to lead to monopoly or oligopoly. Quite the contrary. I believe blockchains offer us a different path.
02:58:54.454 - 02:59:35.382, Speaker A: We still have the economics of software, zero marginal cost. We still have network effects. But on public blockchains, instead of vendor lock in from proprietary technology, we have genuine open access. And that should lead to a substantially more level playing field and real competition. And that's good for all companies in a global digital ecosystem, not just a few really big ones, right? Digital intermediaries are the kind that we've been dealing with for 30 years. They have really come to dominate so many different industries. And if you look at these digital intermediaries, they are centrally controlled marketplaces that manage the flow of information.
02:59:35.382 - 03:00:41.274, Speaker A: And that flow is often asymmetrical, right? The party at the center knows more about what's going on than any other participant. And it doesn't matter whether we're talking about sneakers or car rental or apartment rental. It's not an accident that the central participant in this flow of information often becomes more valuable than all of the participants at the edge, sometimes combined. In a blockchain environment, we can do all the things that centralized digital environments can do but put everybody on a level playing field, right? And this means same work as centralized systems, but with a truly level playing field and no risk of a central market orchestrator becoming a central market monopolist. Now, fear of digital intermediaries isn't just a theory. It has had a huge impact on how enterprises run their businesses. And what I mean by this is if you look inside the average large company, what you'll see over the last 30 years is ever increasing.
03:00:41.274 - 03:01:38.634, Speaker A: Sophistication inside the enterprise so they've got digital shop floors, they've got ERP systems that keep track of every order that's been placed and every contract that's been signed and every person that's been hired. There are now planning and scheduling systems that take orders and they do algorithms to determine optimal manufacturing, their analytical tools, their machine learning tools. There's a ton of stuff that goes on inside the enterprise. But the fear of being stuck in some kind of all powerful digital marketplace means that enterprises haven't extended that to integrate with these central market environments. Instead, they stick to very low risk systems. And what that means is when two companies want to communicate, they may have all this incredible sophistication internally. And when they go to communicate with somebody else or do a deal with somebody else, it all gets reduced to sending somebody a PDF file by email or maybe a spreadsheet if we're lucky.
03:01:38.634 - 03:02:17.174, Speaker A: They use something called EDI Electronic Data Interchange, which is basically business to business text messaging. That has not changed since the early 1970s. Right? So it takes all this incredible sophistication, shared process, shared facts, shared tools, and boils it down to a little PDF sheet, right? But that's not what enterprises really need. They need sophisticated, smart digital interactions that have multiple parties involved. They have shared facts and they have shared business logic. Now, some of you who have been participants in this finalist discussion just now, you are thinking to yourself, well, yeah, we know how to do that. That's easy.
03:02:17.174 - 03:03:04.774, Speaker A: You're right. It absolutely is right. We believe at EY that public blockchains will do for business ecosystems what ERP Enterprise Resource Planning, the software that companies use to manage themselves internally did within side the enterprise, that those systems joined up the left hand and the right hand. They made sure that if you bought the last widget off the shelf in the store in Omaha, it triggered an order to replace it in California. ERP connected the enterprise blockchains will do that for connecting between enterprises. Now, the business benefits that we have seen for our clients are gargantuan. And I just want to pick off one, which is one of my favorite examples.
03:03:04.774 - 03:03:35.954, Speaker A: EY is building in cooperation with Microsoft, a blockchain system on Ethereum. In this case, it's a private Ethereum version. Although we'd like to get to public one day, we are building on Ethereum, the next generation royalty engine for Microsoft. So when Microsoft buys software, they need to pay for it. They need to sell it. They sell it on the Xbox video game system, they need to pay for it. And it's a complicated system, 3000 different suppliers, everyone with a unique contract.
03:03:35.954 - 03:04:09.938, Speaker A: As we move those contracts from paper, from PDF files to blockchain based ethereum based smart contracts. We're getting enormous, enormous performance increases. 99% less cycle time, right? That's a fancy way of saying way faster. Literally 45 days. Takes 45 days after the end of the month to calculate. And now we're down to like four minutes, right? Not only is it way faster, but it is also substantially cheaper. Almost half the price of the existing system.
03:04:09.938 - 03:04:49.686, Speaker A: And that includes all the cost to translate the paper contracts into digital contracts and much more trustworthy because the participants can see business transactions as they're happening. They can inspect the logic, oh, that's that deal. Here's how much I get. I understand this. This looks like the agreement we negotiated, right? So that's just speeding up the process. And we haven't even gotten to anything all that really sophisticated. Where we can get really sophisticated is the kind of stuff that consumers are doing today with DeFi, right? So for consumers, DeFi kind of feels old hat.
03:04:49.686 - 03:05:28.170, Speaker A: The first generation of smart contracts weren't actually that smart. And I hope I'm not going to offend anybody here, but the truth is they kind of kept track of assets. They kept track of the registry of who had those assets and some of the properties of those assets. But when we get into DeFi, we're starting to get into properly smart, smart contracts where you can hold assets, you can move them around, you can insure them, you can pay for them, you can transfer them, you can lease them, you can do all kinds of stuff. This is classic stuff that enterprises need to do. Now, DeFi today isn't suitable for enterprises. It's too early stage.
03:05:28.170 - 03:05:48.286, Speaker A: There are too many bugs in it, right. Programmability, which is the value proposition, also brings a risk. But also, more importantly, there's no privacy in DeFi. But this is what enterprises want. This is what enterprises do today. They do all these things today. They just do them in a very slow, paper based, expensive process.
03:05:48.286 - 03:06:18.694, Speaker A: I shouldn't say paper anymore. It's just PDF files, but it's the same thing. The future of business operations is more than just DeFi, though. DeFi is clever because it takes financial assets which are already entirely digital and kind of acts upon them. But we can do more than that. So if you think about kind of a classic business model of manufacturing, right? I buy raw materials, I manufacture into product, I move the product out to warehouses. I store them in warehouses and I sell them in stores.
03:06:18.694 - 03:06:49.474, Speaker A: DeFi can deliver decentralized financial services all across that process. We don't need to stop with DeFi. We should go on to Dsys decentralized systems, right? It's not just that we want to manage finance. We need to manage business operations. No company runs entirely by itself. If you have a fancy new phone that you might have received in the mail this week, that new phone was not made by the company whose name is on the phone. They designed it.
03:06:49.474 - 03:07:32.702, Speaker A: They arranged everything. But it was done by other companies. Right? And the systems that manage that are very complex. And finally, not just the systems, but the operations themselves. 3d printing, warehousing, air freight, they can all be tokenized and sold and managed on a blockchain in a way that is completely standardized. And it's not an accident that I'm using Lego blocks to pick this, because ultimately, if you pick up the right set of Lego blocks, you can put together a whole company from different decentralized architectures and run an entire business with a very small number of people and an extraordinary degree of automation and integration. All of this is great vision of the future.
03:07:32.702 - 03:08:02.486, Speaker A: But there is one thing that is missing. And if Ethereum, the Ethereum community and enterprises are going to meet together, there is one thing that we must embrace together, and it is privacy. Right? We want the maximum level of privacy possible. Maybe not always for the same reasons that some Ethereum users do. But enterprises do not want their competition to know what they're buying, how much they're spending, where it's going. They don't want them to go to know any of that. And privacy should not be confused with anonymity.
03:08:02.486 - 03:08:32.370, Speaker A: It's not about evading regulations. It's not about defining the law. It's about keeping your competition from knowing what you're doing. And that means private asset management, buy, sell, transfer, pay in privacy, private business logic. Nobody should be able to read the terms and conditions of the contracts that we have together. Right? I strongly believe in the value proposition of proving what we say is truthful. But that does not mean that everybody should be able to see what we agree upon.
03:08:32.370 - 03:09:17.874, Speaker A: Verifiable business identity. So much of what's been talked about in the recent path with regard to identity is incredibly important. But it's mostly focused on individuals. I also need to know not just that you are you, but also that enterprises I transact with are who they say they are. And then finally, private data synchronization, right? So rules like GDPR and other things mean that we should never leave sensitive personal information or sensitive business information on chain. But we do need to be able to use the chain to transfer data, to identify partners, to prove what we did, what we said we did, right? So these are all things that enterprises and individuals need. And we want to see those things get embraced and built about.
03:09:17.874 - 03:09:46.886, Speaker A: And if there's one thing that's frustrating and challenging, it's building for privacy. There's no question it is much harder than building systems without privacy. And I can tell you this because that's all we do. I have probably more. Most of my developers are struggling with the challenges of architecting and building solutions that support privacy on public blockchains. But it's essential. Now, at EY, we're investing very very heavily in public Ethereum.
03:09:46.886 - 03:10:21.042, Speaker A: It is the number one investment priority for us. We have been investing in some really important technologies. Probably the most prominent one that we've been working on is a solution called Nightfall that's been around for now three years. We actually launched the first version, the prototype version of Nightfall in Prague at DevCon a few years ago. And it's a zero knowledge proof based tool for enabling private, secure, regulatory compliant transactions on the public Ethereum main net. But don't call it EY. Nightfall.
03:10:21.042 - 03:10:53.182, Speaker A: It's Nightfall because we put it into the public domain. Right? It is free. It's in the public domain. We gave up all ownership of it to it. We have donated it to the Ethereum community, although we continue to work on developing and expanding it. We did that again with Baseline. So Baseline, we worked with Microsoft and we worked with Consensus, and we've added a bunch of protocols for completing from going from private transfers and payments to private transfers and payments and shared business logic and again donated into the public domain.
03:10:53.182 - 03:11:30.800, Speaker A: This one being managed by the Oasis Foundation. Now, these are huge investments by EY, millions of dollars in research that we are donating the public domain. I don't want you to get the wrong idea. We're not a nonprofit. We still have a business to run and we have been building out our own products in this environment. The two ones that you probably have heard about are OpsChain, which is for doing business transactions on blockchains, like procurement, traceability, contract, and then blockchain Analyzer, which is blockchain analytics, financial statement, audit, security testing and review. And those actually you can try out at blockchain Ey.com.
03:11:30.800 - 03:12:06.330, Speaker A: Now, an Ethereum ecosystem that has a lot of enterprise participation, I believe. It's not just a bigger ecosystem, it will be a better ecosystem for all the participants. And I feel very strongly about this. Right? I am here to persuade you, I hope that enterprises are going to be helpful in building out this ecosystem to start with. It's going to be a more secure ecosystem. Enterprises have trillions of dollars at stake, so the entire value chain is worth money. It gets a huge amount of focus on security.
03:12:06.330 - 03:13:02.438, Speaker A: There are tons of enterprise researchers who want to work on blockchain security. It will be more decentralized, right? Ethereum is already highly decentralized. But what happens when the world's top 2000 companies decide that they all want to set up their own Ethereum node, that they want to do some staking because they can transact on the Ethereum environment? That means a lot more genuine decentralization by companies who care about a just verifiable and properly decentralized system. More scalable. Again, huge amounts of research and energy being invested to maintain reasonable transaction processing times, investment in kind of algorithms and scalability. It's a big deal and it costs a lot of money. And then finally more private, right? Keeping data secure, keeping it private is a major enterprise priority.
03:13:02.438 - 03:14:10.042, Speaker A: And thanks to laws like GDPR, it's not just an enterprise priority. The risk of violating those rules, of losing track of your data comes with significant financial penalties. So enterprises are prepared to spend real money on research and technology and tools that secure the privacy of your data and do it in a genuinely decentralized blockchain environment. Now, I think in particular, one of the things I want to talk about, and one of the things that I think is underappreciated, is that there's an important role for trusted third parties in making blockchains better ecosystems. We talk a lot about kind of trust free environments, but the truth is, yes, some parts of the blockchain environment are genuinely kind of no trust needed because everything that happens on chain is verifiable on chain. But that's not always true for the things that happen off chain. And the future of Ethereum is about interacting with and connecting to systems that have instantiations assets, tools that are off chain.
03:14:10.042 - 03:15:07.502, Speaker A: Now, a big part of that can be served with things like Oracles. And Oracles are brilliant and invaluable because they provide redundancy and they provide a kind of form of crowdsourcing of certain data. But there are also some areas where there is only one data provider, and there can only be one data provider. If you want to know whether a particular shipping company delivered your product, the only person who can tell you if that shipping company delivered that product is that shipping company. So how do you know if they're telling the truth? How do you know if they're being accurate? How do you know if their systems are reliable, if their timestamps are correct? The answer is something that has been going on in the audit business for decades. It's called Attestation or SoC reports, which are called system of control reports. This is a routine business for audit firms, and it should be a part of the future of blockchain.
03:15:07.502 - 03:15:48.782, Speaker A: Right. Independent Attestation doesn't mean, by the way, an end to fraud. It doesn't mean an end to dishonesty. But if you have third parties who are inspecting business process who are required to put their name on the line, the odds of kind of widespread fraud, I think, potentially go down. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. This kind of technology, these capabilities exist in the market today together already. And very importantly, it's really important to remember that there's a difference between a trusted third party of which you have a choice of many different service providers and a centralized intermediary that has a veto or control over the system.
03:15:48.782 - 03:16:22.410, Speaker A: Right? One of these is a useful addition to the environment, I believe. The other is something that I don't want to sign up for. Right. I don't want to be the only party that does this, but I want to have a framework and a set of tools that we accept that in some cases, it's useful to have external attestation about something. Now, some of you, your eyes are glazing over your sock reports. What are these things? And honestly, I have to tell you, I've been at EY for five years. I tried so hard to ignore as much of this as possible for as long as possible.
03:16:22.410 - 03:17:46.450, Speaker A: But the reality is that the ins and outs of regulatory compliance, audits, SoC reports are important. And I encourage you to think about these things, not because they're interesting in and of themselves to everybody, but because the stakes are really high, right? The stakes are very high. If a public blockchain, if Ethereum or some other equally good, genuinely decentralized, truly open system doesn't triumph, the results for the world will be bad. And the reason I say that is because we haven't repealed the economics of software, right? Blockchains are still subject to economics of the software. That means zero marginal cost and network effects, right? And so what we see over and over again in this world is that time and again, whether it's mainframe operating systems, desktop operating systems, mobile device operating systems, social networks, internet protocols, maybe blockchains as well, we tend to end up with just one and occasionally two dominant platforms. Not only do we tend to end up with only one or two dominant technology platforms, but dislodging them is almost impossible. Once you've picked a particular platform, whatever it is, there's very little chance to go back and change your mind.
03:17:46.450 - 03:19:15.410, Speaker A: There are people who've been trying to get us to use Linux on a desktop for decades. And as much as I love Linux and I love playing around with these technologies, the truth is it's never really gotten any traction. And so what I would ask you to do is if you think about does it matter if enterprises join the Ethereum blockchain? I would say it does, because if they don't join the Ethereum blockchain, they will join a blockchain. And if that blockchain is not open and genuinely decentralized, it will become a very different environment. So to quote a famous movie, do you feel lucky? Because I don't want to leave things to luck, right? The Internet, for all of its shortcomings, and there are many, the Internet is like Ethereum, a public and permissionless network. It allows this very orderly world of enterprise commerce to exist alongside an entire spectrum of stuff, right? Some of it very, very good and some of it maybe not very good, right? And what we know is that although 80 or 90% of the money, following the classic 80 20 rule, most of the money is in this nice, orderly, well maintained enterprise garden. But most of the innovation, most of the transformation is outside of it, right? Disruptive, innovators, they don't come from inside the walled garden.
03:19:15.410 - 03:19:49.142, Speaker A: Dual use technologies, they don't come from inside the walled garden. The dark web certainly doesn't. And over time, many of these things, like. Ethereum and Bitcoin are slowly making their way towards the kind of well behaved enterprise walled garden. But they were allowed to exist on the internet because the Internet is public and it's permissionless. They didn't have to get permission from somebody, say, hey, I have this idea for a blockchain. It allows people to transact pseudonymously in a potential currency.
03:19:49.142 - 03:20:26.090, Speaker A: No one said to them, let me form a committee and let's invite the lawyers to discuss and we'll let you know if you can join. But that's what it will be like in a permissioned ecosystem. And if I have one final thought for all of you, it's very simple and it's very clear. There is no such thing as permissioned innovation, right? If you have to ask permission, the answer. If your product is sufficiently clever, sufficiently brilliant and sufficiently disruptive, if you have to ask permission to offer it, the answer will always be no. So that's it for me. I'm looking forward.
03:20:26.090 - 03:21:09.970, Speaker A: We have an amazing panel and I'm going to hand it over to Dan to get us going on. Oh, thank you, Dan. I love that. That was awesome. Paul what is the sound of just one audience? I get the rest of the audio track in to get the big clap. That was great, Paul. All right, so that was a fantastic introduction to the enterprise story and the enterprise community that bringing here to this panel.
03:21:09.970 - 03:21:32.510, Speaker A: I'm Dan Shaw. I'm an advisor to the Ethereum Foundation on the enterprise ecosystem. Today you met Paul and we'll introduce a couple of the rest of our panelists here. So, Karen, do you want to introduce yourself? And then we'll hand it off to Joe.
03:21:33.090 - 03:21:50.340, Speaker B: Sounds good. Hi, everyone, and congratulations to the finalists today and for everything you've built and been working on. My name is Karen Scarborough, I work for BP and our Innovation Group, and I'm excited to talk about an enterprise and Ethereum today.
03:21:54.150 - 03:22:36.290, Speaker A: Tim hey, everybody. I'm Joe McCann. I'm currently a strategist in the developer division of Cloud and AI at Microsoft. And prior to joining Microsoft, I joined about a year ago. I actually was actively involved with Dan Shaw in the Node JS community and we co founded a business together called Node Source, which was the Node JS company. And so we have quite a bit of experience working with open source technologies and bringing them to enterprise and understanding that kind of positive feedback loop. So, really excited to be able to share my experience and then also talk about how I think the Ethereum community could benefit from a lot of what Paul laid out in his keynote.
03:22:36.290 - 03:23:26.850, Speaker A: Well, insert the Paul Rudd Jeff of like, who would have expected you to be? So, you know, we have some high profile community members here and representing your organization, and a lot of what you get tasked with and asked to do is translating all of what's going on outside into your local community. So Karen, maybe you could kick us off. Where do you find folks getting hung up with misconceptions that you are constantly having to redirect them toward?
03:23:28.230 - 03:24:50.320, Speaker B: Well, with the the first use cases that really stood out to enterprise were around tracking and tracing for blockchain and Supply chain. And when you're explaining that to the audience in Supply Chain, in which I used to work in that arena with ERP systems, as Paul mentioned, when you say distributed database or distributed ledger, people think of putting their data on that and they think of using blockchain as a vessel to actually share the data itself. And the past three, four years of proof of concepts and enterprise, there's been an aim to be able to use blockchain to do that instead of what it's fundamentally meant to do around verification of transactions and being able to compose multiple applications one on top of another. So I think there's some reeducation that needs to happen around where and when to appropriately use blockchain and where to look at the innovation of it as well. I think we've hit a lot of upper peaks and what we've seen private blockchains able to accomplish. So looking more to where the real innovation is in the public space is where to look next, really.
03:24:51.330 - 03:25:38.060, Speaker A: Right on. Joe, do you want to jump? Sure. I mean, so from my perspective, I try to harness the view of the developer and map a lot of that to how the enterprise thinks about new technologies. And so I think one of the things is that there's been a significant amount of work done around the tooling and infrastructure required for developers to actually build applications, period. And I think there's still a lot to be done there. I know Microsoft is actively involved across many teams, across other divisions, outside of the developer division that I work in, but within developer know we are responsible for things like Visual Studio vs. Code, GitHub, Azure Services.
03:25:38.060 - 03:26:42.170, Speaker A: And so looking at having kind of the primitives, if you will, fully baked and then moving those towards kind of what are the best practices or standards. And I know Microsoft working with Paul on baseline protocol is helping shape a lot of that for specific enterprise applications. There's still that kind of hurdle mentally or sort of passionately to move traditional, say, Java or net developers to something like Solidity or to just the idea of smart contract programming. So I think there's still a lot of work that needs to be done from the communications level. How do we message, how do we build an architecture around messaging with respect to building smart contract applications? And once developers get more comfortable with that and we start to see a bit more tangibly the power of these types of applications, I think you'll start to see a lot more flywheel effect of the tools and services that will start to stem from that to support the continued growth. Nice meeting developers where they are, not expecting them to make the journey. That's awesome.
03:26:42.170 - 03:27:18.830, Speaker A: That's exactly right. Paul the developer tools are the single most important thing. Unfortunately, we're still fairly immature in the world of tools for privacy. So Nightfall was an effort on our part to make things simpler. It's far from simple overall and the toughest thing we've seen, and we spent a lot of time kind of building applications. It's hard for some people to wrap their heads around this idea of a properly decentralized application. They keep trying to write the same centralized application, but now it's in solidity instead of Java.
03:27:18.830 - 03:27:46.694, Speaker A: And I keep having these discussions like, think like a blockchain native inputs are tokens, outputs are tokens. We're doing transactions. It's a hard mindset to shift. Enterprises are struggling with that. But I think they will get there, and they get it when you start to talk to them about the business process and the inputs and outputs of things like purchase orders and invoices. Right on. So that sounds something interesting.
03:27:46.694 - 03:28:39.126, Speaker A: Where open source becomes this sort of essential conduit for interactions, open source is already hard for the enterprise. How does the addition of working in public blockchain especially change that landscape? Good. Paul for us, it's actually quite the opposite. Open source is easier than closed source. And especially we made, I think, a particularly important decision, which was to go fully public domain. So one of the rules that affects companies that do auditing is you should not evaluate your own work, because predictably, that leads to I did that, and I think it was a brilliant problem. Right.
03:28:39.126 - 03:29:14.978, Speaker A: So imagine that if we kept control of all of this code and other companies used it, and some of those companies were audited by us, we would be in a situation where we might be called upon to evaluate that code by going full public domain relinquishing ownership. There's a bunch of advantages. Number one, it's not ours. Right? And other people have taken it, they've edited, they've changed it. So it's not just that it's not ours anymore, but it's changed from what we originally did. Right. Secondly, there's no financial incentive for us.
03:29:14.978 - 03:29:49.710, Speaker A: There's no complications. And then, thirdly, for enterprises, one of the problems with open source, which is also a problem for any form of software, is the license agreement. Right? That thing you click on, okay, to that thing is 60,000 words. Right? Ours is like six words, which is, do what you want with this, it's not ours anymore. And that actually removes friction. So in this case, I think open source and especially the public domain flavor of open source was powerful for us. Nice.
03:29:49.710 - 03:31:05.714, Speaker A: Joe. I know we had to deal with a lot of folks with WTFPL and helping folks do that. Anything that you want to add or Karen? Yeah, I mean, I'll just chime in quickly before karen one of the things that we learned with kind of growing. The global node JS community is on the one hand, we had kind of like this really early in the beginning, these kind of almost anarchic style open source zealots and developers, right, that were just writing tons of code and releasing tons of modules. And there is an open source license called WTFPL that is as plain as day, you can do whatever you want with this, except enterprise legal departments don't approve that license. And so what we recognized was that even something as simple as no, I seriously don't care, you can do whatever you want with it, restricts the ability for enterprise developers or developers that work within an enterprise to contribute to a project. And so I think there are some things that can be done and I clearly don't know the spectrum of this within the broader ETH community because there's so many different projects available, but there are little things like that that add up to friction.
03:31:05.714 - 03:31:55.006, Speaker A: And I think to Paul's point, removing that friction can help accelerate a lot of the innovation. I think the second piece is that 20 years ago open source was not welcomed by most large companies, let alone certainly tech companies. And we've seen a complete about face with that. In fact, even at Microsoft, we are incredibly passionate and welcoming to the open source community and open source lots and lots of code. We do a lot of products in the open. This is just a complete sea change event that happened with software development. I think the next iteration of this is recognizing the value of a public chain and moving a lot of this stuff to public chain and seeing what is the value that we can actually all start to build, still retaining.
03:31:55.006 - 03:32:25.040, Speaker A: It's just the same thing with a lot of companies today. They open source a lot of stuff, they provide stuff in the open, but they still have their secret sauce or they still have something that actually they can derive value from to serve their shareholders or their business. I think the same thing is ultimately going to be happening with respect to public blockchain is they can treat it almost like how they've thought about open source initially 20 years ago, and recognizing now open source is actually the biggest value driver for software development today.
03:32:26.610 - 03:33:09.850, Speaker B: Ron for me, it makes me think of a conversation I recently had in the organization. We were talking about open sourcing and blockchain and public blockchain and why that would be valuable. And I pointed to a particular project in the DeFi space and one of our leaders looked at it and said, well, there's only just a few pull requests on this. I don't see how open sourcing it contributes to contributions. And we actually had a conversation around, I showed him the activity and the total value locked in this project, how other projects had built on top of it. And when he looked at it again. He said, okay, so it's more of the open API.
03:33:09.850 - 03:33:39.080, Speaker B: And I know solidity people will correct me and say it's an mean just that transition in language and understanding. That really was a light bulb moment for the both of us in understanding the value that we were trying to communicate and really where open source is different now potentially in public blockchains than it was in the past.
03:33:42.410 - 03:34:46.838, Speaker A: So, as we're looking forward, we have all the consortium chains and a lot of the effort that we've put into that. But I keep hearing everyone really looking toward main net and toward our collaboration there. One of the key components that I see in terms of aligning enterprise expectation is simplifying their cognitive load with things like baseline protocol. Paul, maybe you could kick off the discussion around baseline. And I know that it's a big contribution from you all, but now getting folks from this exists to we're going to go out into the sun and operate there. How's that going and how can we sort of help folks on that journey? So it's going pretty well overall. We've gotten a pretty good reception.
03:34:46.838 - 03:35:10.398, Speaker A: We've tried very hard to switch the conversation with our clients from this is Blockchain. And let us talk about what blockchain can do for you to this is option network procurement. It's a procurement system. It guarantees that you get your negotiated volume discount. When we switch that conversation, blockchain tends to sort of be further back in this and it's much more about the value that can be created. Right. Eventually we get to it's.
03:35:10.398 - 03:35:50.580, Speaker A: Built on the baseline protocol, we use zero knowledge proofs in order to protect your privacy. So my message, relentless message inside of EY and to our teams is let's talk about the product, let's talk about what the product does, and then if the technical people want to get into baseline, we're happy to do that. So that's the conversation we're trying to shift towards when we talk to external clients and decision makers. Now, Karen is a good example of somebody who is quite savvy about the underlying technology, right? And Karen, you probably talk to a ton of your own business users inside of BP every day.
03:35:52.950 - 03:36:43.860, Speaker B: And I was in supply chain prior to jumping into Blockchain. So understanding. Having used an ERP system, like I can say from my experience as a buyer and as a customer service rep way early in my career, I would have loved just one portal and base system to where all my customers connected. Because what happened, although things would be digitally automated, if I had to log into one customer portal for customer A, another one for customer B and C then it really didn't achieve the value that people originally perceived it doing because you were actually increasing the workload. So if you're able to connect all that in a better way, it's a much better environment to work in.
03:36:46.950 - 03:37:26.330, Speaker A: Joe anything else you want to add to that or we'll move into my sort of ender question. Cool. All right. I want to say one thing about Microsoft. So the toughest thing that we just I want to tell this story because it's both good story and thoroughly humiliating and there's nothing I like more than humiliating myself. So early on in my time at EY, we had this amazing procurement contract from a really big company and we built a whole procurement system for them and we were in the final review meeting and the client's like, this is amazing, it's fantastic. It's going to save us hundreds of millions of dollars and we're not going to implement.
03:37:26.330 - 03:38:10.982, Speaker A: And I was like, what? I was writing the press release in my head and my brain caught up with it and we're not going to implement part. And the answer was blockchain news. Scary, right? Change is good. You call us when somebody else has done this first. And that is so many of our sales cycles ended in that discussion. And if there's one thing that I'm really grateful to for Microsoft, the Xbox royalty system that we are doing together, we found a client who was courageous enough to go first. And that is something that is as rare and valuable as possible to get because once they do it, the world follows.
03:38:10.982 - 03:39:57.440, Speaker A: But you just got to get that client and no matter how many times you tell somebody we're using it, they don't see that as nearly as valuable as having an actual external client that's using this solution and can report business value, then that helps to unlock the floodgates and it's one in every industry. And in the case of Microsoft, we could not ask for a better partner and client because of their courage to go forward and to be first. Well, on behalf of all of Microsoft, I will thank yeah, we saw this in know there was a point where D Shaw is going to talk about Netflix and Netflix PayPal, Walmart, that was just a stick in Node JS. So looking into the future, let's go into the next big push. Joe, do you want to kick us off? Where are things going? Yeah, so just to give folks a little bit more about my background, I've been in technology for 20 years plus, but I've also worked on Wall Street and actually just before I joined Microsoft, I ran a Quant trading desk at an institutional hedge fund in San Francisco but for cryptocurrencies. And so what was really fascinating about that is you can imagine how disjoint and kind of broken these markets are. There's incredible opportunities, but from a developer or a technologist perspective, I was really fascinated what was happening with DeFi and I saw a number of the hackathon submissions that are mind blowingly, incredibly brilliant and amazing.
03:39:57.440 - 03:41:11.174, Speaker A: But for me there's something very unique about the concept of DeFi in general and it's because for the first time, I believe we now have the ability to have money or value that is programmatically accessible. And that unleashes innovation at a level in finance that I think has never been seen before. And so as I try to, as best I can, keep up with the DeFi community, I take a step back and look more broadly at kind of the ethereum community of developers and say there's kind of like two types of developers. And I'm clearly generalizing, so don't beat me up, Internet, please. But we recognize this in other open source projects. You have some folks that are really good at scalability and performance and just getting in and fiddling bits, right? I almost call them like the mad scientist kind of academic type programmers that just want to work on the core open source project or set of projects. And then you have these, what I call product engineers, where they see these primitives, these Legos, if you will, and they're like, oh, I see all the Legos, let me build a thing with it.
03:41:11.174 - 03:42:05.874, Speaker A: And for me, that is best personified in what's happening with DeFi. So what's really exciting from a developer's perspective and I think where we're going to see a lot more kind of innovative growth in the ethereum community is the explosive amount of innovation in DeFi. And I'll give one example, and I know this canonical example has been used probably a hundred times today, but there's a concept of flash loans or collateralist loans. This concept of being able to have a parallel set of instructions to arbitrage something or enable lending without someone actually having collateral is next to impossible in the traditional financial world. Yet when you take technologists that have this new platform and set of primitives that are available to them, we've come up with this as a community or someone came up with this concept. Right. And now it's kind of a caught wildfire.
03:42:05.874 - 03:42:44.710, Speaker A: We saw over the summer this concept of yield farming. And I won't go into whether it was bad or good. It's just the idea that we continue to see more and more innovation around the ethereum community via the DeFi vehicle. And so that, to me, is one of the most exciting things is we have an opportunity here to kind of rewrite how we think about value exchange and literally write it programmatically, which is one of the areas that myself and my team are really keeping a pulse on is to kind of monitor that group to see how can we best support them, to continue innovating in the space. Nice. Karen, what's your next big push?
03:42:45.770 - 03:43:40.082, Speaker B: Well, it's been a really big year for BP in multiple ways. So in February we announced that we're aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. Well, I should say we will be carbon neutral by 2050, and that's really exciting for us. So even absent of COVID and the major economic changes, we were going to change in a big way this year. And what's happened around the world has only accelerated that with where oil and gas is right now. So we are changing tremendously as a company internally, as opposed to where our focuses are, where our new business models are going. So right now we're in a major push of validating demand for our new initiatives and projects and adapting to innovating behind having discovered that demand.
03:43:40.082 - 03:44:12.740, Speaker B: So the biggest pushes for us is to stay innovative while validating demand. And obviously we're here because public blockchains are in consideration of that, but there are so many other technologies that are contributing to that. But we're really transitioning just much of what we're focusing on in climate action to better serve and better prepare for a more sustainable world ahead.
03:44:13.670 - 03:44:45.670, Speaker A: Awesome. That's exciting. Paul, next big push. So maybe sort of one big push and one prediction. So the big push for us really is the industrialization of public blockchain. So over the last six months, and over the next six months, we're finishing this process of moving all of our EY blockchain products from being kind of behind the firewall implementations to SaaS applications that run at blockchain ey.com. So we're taking away all the complexity.
03:44:45.670 - 03:45:54.942, Speaker A: So if you're not a low level developer, you can go to blockchain ey.com, you can set up procurement, you can do Block Explorer, you can do smart contract testing, things like that. So we're migrating all of our product into this environment and we are maturing it to the point where we think we want to be able to run almost any enterprise business process. So my hypothesis is fundamentally the way the companies interact is it's all variations of I have money, you've got stuff, products or services, and we are exchanging them under the rules of some kind of an agreement. Well, the money and the stuff can be accurately represented as tokens of some kind and the exchange is represented as a smart contract. So if I get really good at representing tokens and I get really good at implementing smart contracts, I have everything I need to model and implement any kind of business process. So that's kind of my number one push is to get to the point where you bring me any process insurance, car sales, manufacturing, output, freight, logistics.
03:45:54.942 - 03:46:45.330, Speaker A: I can model that, implement it, and run it for you as a network level solution. That's job one, job two. So that's my big push. Strategic goal or prediction that I would make is I believe that by 2030, more than 50% of all new business contracts will be done on the public ethereum main net. Now, how do I get to that number? Do I just magically make it up? No, I nearly magically make it up based on what happened with cloud. So in 2006, Amazon brought us AWS and especially the kind of elastic storage. It was a storage environment right at that time, if you had gone to a corporate CIO and said, hey, you're going to use the public cloud, they'd be like, the what? Right.
03:46:45.330 - 03:47:32.002, Speaker A: Or maybe if they knew what it was, they'd be like, not ready, not mature in 2017. Eleven years later, more than 50% of all new ERP implementations, all new enterprise application implementations were done on the public cloud. So we went from what's that to of course I'm doing on the public cloud in about a decade. I think that sort of in 2020, with the maturing of privacy based technology and the shift towards public blockchains, this is the starting gun for Enterprise Usability. And so a decade, in the course of a decade, we're going to go from, that sounds interesting, but I don't think I can do this to of course we want to execute this contract on the Ethereum main net. So that's my prediction. Enterprises take time.
03:47:32.002 - 03:48:19.582, Speaker A: A decade is not an unreasonable transition. Time. That's a great way to end. All right, so that does it for our panel. I want to make sure that we open things up to some questions. I'm getting some questions from chat from folks. All right, how will enterprise adoption look different in different countries with different kinds of economies? Will there be a leapfrog dynamic like what we see with it rollout in developing countries? Anyone want to jump on that? I can take a stab at it, but I'll preface this with that.
03:48:19.582 - 03:49:07.562, Speaker A: It's probably wrong. It's just a theory. So what this makes me think of is this question, the way it's framed of how will enterprise adoption look different in different countries with different kind of economies? Reminds me of the explosion of mobile payments in Africa. So for decades, the majority of folks in Africa were underbanked and they just simply did not have a bank nearby or were unable to get a bank account, but instead they all had mobile phones. And so the mobile phone actually enabled them to more or less have a bank account. They used this thing called M Pesa, which was, I believe it was a combination of a number of companies that came together to enable payments. Kenya mobile.
03:49:07.562 - 03:50:05.598, Speaker A: There you. So so for them, they had this kind know, leapfrog moment of we went from being completely underbanked to being one of the leaders in digital banking and mobile banking right, in terms of the experience for their consumers and users. And so I don't know what that analogy looks like today with, say, enterprise adoption of smart contract programming or blockchain based applications. But it makes me think that that would be a clue for what that would actually look like is what are some areas know, somebody doesn't have the ability to, I don't know, have access to certain systems or there's so much fragmentation, or there's something disjoint with the experience today that they just can't download something from GitHub and get it up and running that enables them to actually jump forward. Similar to what happened with folks in Africa with Mpesa. Paul. Karen.
03:50:05.598 - 03:50:39.342, Speaker A: Anything else? I got another question coming in. Let's go to the next question. All right, this is an interesting one. So why do you all think that privacy hasn't been much of the focus of enterprise blockchain work? So I want to dive on that one. Yeah, do it. Privacy has been the focus of enterprise blockchain work, but the way that it's been focused on has been different. So privacy on a public network is really hard.
03:50:39.342 - 03:51:14.054, Speaker A: I mean, we have six nuclear physicists, mathematician, PhDs working on this and have been working on this for three or four years, and nobody remembers this, but when we debuted our prototype at DevCon of Nightfall, the gas consumption to complete a single ZKP transaction cost over $100. Right. This was not a viable solution, and it was incredibly difficult. It was obscure. It was expensive. Not many people thought it was possible, but there was an easier way of doing privacy. It was called put a private blockchain together.
03:51:14.054 - 03:51:55.226, Speaker A: And so that's what everybody did. And private blockchains have their own immense problems, which is why they've largely fallen flat, because signing up for some kind of proprietary private network that's really expensive is a deal killer. And I'll be honest with you. I spent years inside of EY dealing with the intense skeptics who thought we were wasting money on all this ZKP stuff. They're like, you got to get with the program and start selling more private blockchain stuff. And the fact is that technically, private blockchains are much easier. But it's a dangerous short term answer because nobody really wants to be on your proprietary private network.
03:51:55.226 - 03:52:04.280, Speaker A: So privacy is the be all and end all of enterprise blockchains. It's just that the way that they chose to do it wasn't really scalable in the long run.
03:52:07.390 - 03:52:51.400, Speaker B: I think Paul said it really well, and I think what I'd have to add is that the standing up of so much private blockchains over the past two, three years within enterprise, if anything, it's a benefit because we've learned and learned the shortcomings there. So, like you said, we have focused on privacy. It's just looked different behind private walls. But we've seen the challenges in getting people on the same consortium on actually building multiple systems on top of a blockchain versus having separate blockchains for all these different proof of concepts. So it's definitely helped us learn what we really need out of a blockchain system.
03:52:52.570 - 03:53:51.100, Speaker A: So I've got a quick jab here, paul, thanks for all the fish, but where's the identity solution for the enterprise that is open public domain? So I think that's one of the areas where I'm hoping that others will step in. Right. We've thought really hard about what is the thing that we can contribute that's the most used, and we decided to zero in on privacy. It's interesting. That there isn't yet a good enterprise identity solution because about 18 months ago I thought, wow, there's so many of these consumer identity programs going on, we should not do something there because it'll become too crowded for enterprises. And maybe I was wrong, although I do know Microsoft is working quite a bit on enterprise identity. So I think our impact can be bigger when we choose to do a small number of things really well and I'm hoping that others will choose to pick identity and make that their success case.
03:53:51.100 - 03:54:52.240, Speaker A: I think Joe's nodding, I don't work on that team. I am familiar with certainly Microsoft has probably the largest identity system today for enterprise with Active Directory and other forms of traditional It identity. I do know that there is a team that's also working on a decentralized version of identity, which I know basically nothing about except that team exists. Welcome to Microsoft, a massive company, but it's exciting to actually hear that, or it's reassuring to hear that. I do agree with you, Paul, that there are certain aspects of it's like these are things that we want to focus on, these are things we want to be really good at. And Microsoft has decades of software development and technology resources available to them that enable them to actually put effort across myriad opportunities with respect to technology innovations. Something like decentralized identity being one of them.
03:54:52.240 - 03:56:24.010, Speaker A: Great. I got one last question here, and this is actually near and dear to my heart in bringing together folks from the enterprise perspective and inviting folks to join. There's one area that I didn't quite get onto this stage and the question is how do we get governments and public industry involved in blockchain? And that was actually one of my stretch goals for these sessions, to get some of the folks that I met at East Denver and the Governor's office there begin connecting the dots with those folks. So it's happening at a certain level, but the enterprise tends to be reticent and private and according to off at its first attempt, public industry and government is even worse. I started my career off in defense and the technology that we were using that was approved was ten to 15 years old, just because that had been what had vetted. So there's innovation happening. I don't know if anyone has any other comments that they want to add specifically to that, but it's beginning to percolate.
03:56:24.010 - 03:57:27.326, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually think that the timing certainly, and I'm going to speak from a US centric point of view because I'm familiar with my country's political and economic standing right now. I actually think if you look at what has happened over the past decade with the decriminalization and legalization of marijuana, it was not because people realized that pot isn't that dangerous of a drug or whatever. It's that there was money involved and a lot of these states were having budget shortfalls and deficits that they saw an opportunity to actually generate additional revenue from taxing marijuana. And hey, why not? Let's decriminalize it. This could also potentially free up resources from the criminal justice system, et, et cetera, cetera, et cetera. Now, if we map that to something like blockchain, look at Paul's case study with Microsoft and Xbox. I mean, we're talking about a 99% reduction in the amount of time that it took to pay out these royalties, 40% just overhead administrative cost.
03:57:27.326 - 03:58:26.020, Speaker A: So I think especially given the COVID environment and how a lot of state and local businesses, governments, are struggling to kind of maintain their balance sheets, this presents an opportunity, I would say, for developers, savvy product people to approach folks at the local level and say, hey, have you thought about adapting this type of technology solution that could save you x amount of dollars? And I think that is the type of thing that could be the kind of Trojan horse, if you will, for lack of a better phrase, to get the idea of utilizing a public chain and understanding how blockchain based applications can be levered inside of the government. That's great. That's a great product development story. All right, well, I'm going to wrap it up with that. Paul, Karen and Joe, thank you so much. This was fantastic discussion. Really appreciate your time.
03:58:26.020 - 03:58:27.810, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
03:58:27.880 - 03:58:28.740, Speaker B: Thank you.
03:58:29.750 - 03:58:56.890, Speaker A: Thank you all for giving us your time today and for an amazing conversation. So, with that, we are ready to move on to our next talk. And I'm super excited to welcome Abby, who's going to be talking about Radical. And for those of you who don't know, she works at Radical and she will be covering a history of kind of how code collaboration has evolved and what a decentralized version of that feature would look like. So without further ado, please welcome Abby.
03:58:58.770 - 03:59:23.490, Speaker B: Thanks so much for the introduction. Excited to be here. Share my screen. Cool. Yeah. So, again, hey, everybody, thank you for having me here. Today I'm going to be talking about Radical and how we're building towards a vision of decentralized code collaboration.
03:59:23.490 - 04:00:12.642, Speaker B: So first, my name is Abby. I work on all things community at Radical. So I've been around the Ethereum community and space for a bit. So I'm really excited to finally start talking to the community about Radical and all the exciting things that we're building. So I think we'll have some time for questions at the end, but if you have any during the presentation, my colleague La is actually in the chat, so feel free to just ping him and get any questions answered because we're going to be covering a lot of ground. So today we're talking about Ethereum's impact. If we start off with why I think Ethereum is impactful, I think it's impactful because Ethereum is a platform for the decentralized Internet and it's also become a really big part of this thing that we call Web Three.
04:00:12.642 - 04:00:57.874, Speaker B: You could call Web Three a framework, a concept, a religion, whatever you want to call it. But in my opinion, I think Web Three represents the transition from an internet controlled by centralized platforms to an Internet powered by decentralized protocols. Now, in the journey towards Web Three, things are still early, but we've been building and have built a lot. We have really strong infrastructure, developer tooling, financial primitives and user interfaces. I mean, looking back to my first DevCon to where we are now, it's wild to see how far the space has come. Sure, there's always room for improvement, but I think we should all give ourselves a pat on the back. The vision of Web Three is something that's very real that we are building today.
04:00:57.874 - 04:02:15.610, Speaker B: But I think that the thing that I find most powerful and exciting about this space is that it's an industry that is entirely online, values total decentralization and is completely open source like at its core we're building software in a decentralized way, in an open source way that is also going to power the decentralized internet. It's a really interesting paradigm and I think it's really cool. However, with this in mind, I think that there is this really big elephant in the room and I think that elephant is code collaboration. The hosting, sharing, collaboration and distribution of the software that we're all building to bring around the Web Three vision and that makes up Web Three's existence is very centralized. So before we tackle that elephant, I think maybe you're wondering what is the problem with centralized code collaboration? To answer that, I want to give a very brief history on the evolution of code collaboration. And I've done a talk that took an hour to talk through all of this, so we'll just get the highlights. But so everything in regards to code collaboration actually starts with version control, right? And the evolution of version control is really quite an interesting story.
04:02:15.610 - 04:03:55.180, Speaker B: Over the years we've seen version control evolve actually from proprietary systems to open source systems, but we've also seen them evolve away from these more local systems to more centralized client server models. But of course everything changed when Git was created by Linus and made free and open source distributed, aka decentralized version control the thing and it just took off from there. And with the rise of Git, of course, came the creation of GitHub, which is created as a web based Git repository. Hosting know GitHub made collaborating on Git just better, right? Workflows around code collaboration evolved from these mailing lists. This is from the Linux kernel mailing list, which are, ifores so hard to understand, to rich web interfaces with all of these new features and workflows that made building software together just a better experience. So I feel like I have to say it before I get into everything that we're doing with Radical, but GitHub is really great and everybody on our team believes this GitHub has played such a big role in all of our lives, and for a good reason, right? I mean, it's like a global social network of developers working on this rich platform that's defined the way that we collaborate on code and is built by nerds who care about open source. And that's always kind of been at the core of the, you know, which is the main centralized hosting platform right now.
04:03:55.180 - 04:05:07.780, Speaker B: But at the end of the day, it's still owned by Microsoft, a huge US corporation. So that means that GitHub is a walled garden built on open soil, very similar to all the other platforms we Web three pioneers are trying to dismantle and divest away from. And so we're starting to see the side effects of these bald gardens. As of recent, we've seen the corporate influence of Microsoft start creeping into the public eye, into our everyday news. Whether it's from entirely banning developers from US sanctioned countries buckling under government pressure to shut down, disruptive or challenging. Software like a protest application or most recently, straight up censoring repositories due to, for example, the Recording Industry Association of America's most recent attack on the open source software repository, YouTube downloader would highly recommend everybody go check out the hacker news thread regarding this. But we're seeing a lot of censorship and a lot of the corporate influence that Microsoft has on a platform like GitHub starts showing itself.
04:05:07.780 - 04:06:20.630, Speaker B: Despite all of these examples, which are important in themselves. I think that the call to decentralized code collaboration isn't just based on Web three values like the decentralized everything ethos, because again, GitHub works for a lot of people and proposing an alternative based purely off of an ideology alone, disregards the reason that these platforms like GitHub became so important in the first place. Again, they just made it easier and better to collaborate on some open protocols. But there are real problems with centralized hosting platforms that we need to be including in the conversation. First, there's an inherent platform risk with any corporate owned platform because they're vulnerable to censorship and usually will be continuously subjected to and usually overtaken by capitalist means, which specifically in the co collaboration sense, these capitalist ends are often totally misaligned with the goals of free and open source communities. Second, there's a real security risk. Central platforms, as we know, are single points of failure and provide many real attack vectors.
04:06:20.630 - 04:07:13.500, Speaker B: When people look at GitHub, you could hack the UI of GitHub. There's tons of different ways that someone could compromise repositories on GitHub. Finally, vendor lock in is kind of this important problem that I think is more of like a latent thing that bubbles under the surface is that it's vendor lock in. All non Git native features on code collaboration platforms like Issues, comments, reviews, PRS are entirely hosted on GitHub. Yeah, of course they're based in code, but the workflows have been defined and are unique to the platform that they are on. So everybody says, well, Git is decentralized, so that's my backup. But what do you do if you lost all of your issues, your PRS, your conversations? Most of the collaboration layer would be stripped away, leaving only the change history of the code.
04:07:13.500 - 04:08:01.370, Speaker B: And also the social network on GitHub is entirely unique to and hosted by GitHub as well. This is the same with other social know. Our developer identity, our stars, our contribution graphs is defined by the social connection through us and other GitHub profiles. It's not sovereign to us. All of our social relationships exist solely within these platforms. So these issues are real and they're bubbling under the surface. And as we see software development continue growing at the rapid pace that it is today and the nature of the digital ecosystem shifting and turning as it eats the world, I think we're going to see these problems become even more critical points of failure if not solved and addressed.
04:08:01.370 - 04:08:47.900, Speaker B: So in a world this is kind of the thesis, right? I think that defines our journey towards decentralized code collaboration. That in a world where nearly all software relies on open source code and our space, our vision of web3 relies on open source code. Maintaining the resilience and the health of the free and open source ecosystem is more important than ever. The issues with hosted platforms cannot be ignored. And so I believe that our dependence on centrally hosted platforms and corporations for the distribution of critical open source infrastructure is inherently unsustainable. And there needs to be like a shift in narrative to prioritize the adoption of decentralized alternatives that abide by the principles of free and open source software. And web3.
04:08:47.900 - 04:09:21.962, Speaker B: Foss and Web Three need resilient infrastructure because we're going to be building challenging systems that people will try to take down. So this is where Radical comes in. If anybody doesn't know what Radical is, it's kind of like the first start of a plant. We say tis the root. So Radical is a completely open garden. It's a peer to peer network for code collaboration that's built on open protocols. And it all starts with Radicallink, which is a peer to peer gossip protocol built on top of Git.
04:09:21.962 - 04:10:17.750, Speaker B: So Radicallink basically extends Git with peer to peer network discovery. Participants in the network share and spread data that they're interested in by keeping local copies and sharing the changes of that data with peers that they track. So with Radical, we replicate the data across repositories. So connected repositories according to kind of like a social graph of contributors and maintainers who checks out and works and contributes to projects. So this enables source code and change sets to be disseminated according to the use and the value of the repository. So it means that more peers who are interested in a certain project or who are working on a certain project, the more available that this project is made throughout the network. And so this gives us the baseline of having a way to share and host code without relying on any intermediary since we're gossiping it through peers.
04:10:17.750 - 04:11:20.406, Speaker B: So with these protocols, our team developed a truly decentralized desktop client for code collaboration that we call upstream. We believe that building functional, usable and beautiful experiences for developers is really essential and is one of the main pain points, I think, in the Web three space. How do we build great experiences that help people get it? And when challenging the status quo, I think that that's just even more important. So while we envision this application to be the main way that users interact with the Radical network, it will not be the only way upstream. As with the Radical protocols, whether it be Git, our Ethereum integration or Radical link will be completely open source and forkable, giving anybody the space to develop in their own code collaboration experience. So what does this app mean for us as developers? Well, Radical gives people the ability to collaborate in the way that they do. Now GitHub completely peer to peer.
04:11:20.406 - 04:12:11.740, Speaker B: So this means that there's no central servers, there's no corporations, nobody owns Radical and no censorship. It'll be a truly free and open network. So in comparison to other decentralized code collab alternatives like self hosted GitLab instances or something, there also will be no hassle setting up these isolated instances that aren't connected to each other because everything will be based on this one peer to peer network. This collaborating peer to peer also means we'll be able to work securely offline. So with Radical, everything will be local. First, this means that all the non Git native artifacts like Issues, Comments and PRS that I said were locked into these centralized platforms will always be available on your machine. You'll be able to use them and work on them offline and have control over them.
04:12:11.740 - 04:12:55.194, Speaker B: Secondly, everything is built on public key cryptography. So this means that in addition to peer identities which will be linked to your device, your code will be backed by cryptographic signatures. So adding another layer of security more than just commit signatures onto your day to day code collaboration interactions, finally you can own your own infrastructure. Radical, as I said, will be free and completely open source forever. It will be technically, politically and economically resilient. And it will be that resilient network for code collaboration that is available everywhere for anybody, no matter where you are. And since it's open source, it's forkable customizable, people can build on it, people can extend it.
04:12:55.194 - 04:13:59.222, Speaker B: Which means that down the line you'll be able to extend Radical to fit your needs instead of being locked into another corporate agenda. But where does Ethereum come in? Because this is Ethereum online and this is really fun to talk about. So I think I want to take this section to kind of talk about what our Ethereum integration is doing for radical and how we're enhancing decentralized code collaboration with this decentralized platform, this platform for the decentralized Internet. So it kind of all starts with this idea that we want to start transitioning from DeFi to devfi. So we want to design radical for sustainability because we believe that sustainability goes beyond just technical resilience as in a peer to peer network. We think that to truly free developers from centralized code collaboration we need to build better solutions for empowering the financial freedom of open source maintainers and developers. And so when we look at Ethereum we see DeFi and we see how powerful DeFi really is.
04:13:59.222 - 04:15:25.458, Speaker B: So DeFi is building an entire alternative financial system in the form of these very hyper specific primitives that we all play games with and watch people play games with. And so when we're building and when we started building with Ethereum, we asked ourselves how can we harness the power of DeFi and use it to empower its own maintainers and developers? So by building an opt in integration layer with Ethereum, we can start moving DeFi to DeFi or decentralized finance that supports sustainable and regenerative funding of open source software. So DeFi kind of applies itself to any financial primitives that empower developers to control the production and distribution of their code. And it's very broad, but it's kind of trying to open up the conversation of what is open source and how can we truly create sustainable infrastructure that is resilient as we keep developing towards the Web Three vision? So let's walk through some of the things that we're going to be able to build with our Ethereum integration. And so the start is being able to have global names and access stations within our peer to peer network. So the Ethereum integration gives us a global consensus layer that kind of makes peer to peer just work. Peer to peer has issues with maintaining a global identity, a seamlessness layer that connects the network to one another because you are working from, again, peer to peer.
04:15:25.458 - 04:16:37.306, Speaker B: So by integrating with ENS we're going to be able to empower users to claim global names and use them to be identified and discovered on the radical peer to peer network. So this gives us the ability to connect identities through separate networks, Ethereum and radical. And it will empower us to be able to attach wallets and Ethereum addresses to our radical profiles, whether it be users or projects. So radical will be able to access the global network effects that are so easily come by by centralized platforms when you just create a profile and you're added to another server yet without the platform risk. And it also empowers some really cool things when you're able to add the power of digital money through wallets and Ethereum addresses and bake that into the code collaboration experience. Secondly, we'll be able to experiment with orgs and teams radical when paired with ethereum will create the space for sovereign digital collectives which are basically DAOs. But with Radical you'll be able to create on chain.
04:16:37.306 - 04:17:54.326, Speaker B: Orgs on Ethereum that can be linked and connected to sets of repositories. On Radical, this will give developers the ability to experiment with decentralized admin control and collectively govern code bases. And it also will give them the opportunity to maintain an audible transparent history of project state on chain through a process that we call checkpointing. So this is basically, instead of just saying, this is the view of the project, trust the UI, we're adding another layer of security into what it means to actually securely collaborate on a very high value project by giving people a way to see who's contributed, what is the history and how this all lines up and have that be validated on chain. So with orgs through Radical and Ethereum, we actually think that DAOs can access a new superpower where everything membership, admin control, governance, canonical project states, source code and just the day to day code collaboration is truly decentralized. And finally we have Radical funding which is our kind of catch all term for how we're experimenting with devfi. So Radical funding will actually be these open source generalized smart contracts for experiences that empower developers to control the production and distribution of their work.
04:17:54.326 - 04:19:00.510, Speaker B: And this can span so far. We have a bunch of different things that we're building that fall under this umbrella that we're excited to test and ship to the ecosystem. But this can go from creating and distributing a monthly free and open source support fund to projects and users that you're interested in that you want to support. Pooling money behind issues to pre fund work that you want maintainers to do so. Giving maintainers the ability to understand what their community members want them to work on, subscribing to projects and users, treating them like creators. Giving them the freedom that platforms like Patreon do over what they can offer through their code base or even creating software licenses and know. The Ethereum integration kind of opens up this whole space for again, how we can bake in value networks into the code collaboration experience, ultimately giving radical users access to recurring and sustainable revenue streams without a reliance on intermediaries with platforms who currently gatekeep access and do so actively.
04:19:00.510 - 04:20:01.280, Speaker B: This is a very important part of this sustainability value proposition is how can we empower the financial sustainability of developers with Radical and with Ethereum and this radical funding features that we think we'll be able to. So that's kind of the big picture for radical and what comes next as we wrap up this talk is that we're actually pushing out our beta very soon and we really want to get people using it. So if you are running a project, working on a project or just want to try the product, really, really reach out to me on Twitter because I'm going to be onboarding folks, throughout the next couple of weeks as we start to push something public. But if know, stay tuned because I think that decentralized code collaboration is definitely here and ready and we're really excited to put this out into the world and specifically into the ethereum ecosystem. Cool, thank you.
04:20:03.430 - 04:21:00.180, Speaker A: Thank you so much Abby, for that amazing talk. We got a lot of comments on how well put together everything was on the presentation side, so definitely want to relay that to you. We have a 32nd delay between people hearing this on YouTube versus me saying this now. So for anybody who's going to hear this in a few seconds, let me know if there's any questions and I'll relay them to this call. I have a couple of questions that we had in mind just from kind of hearing everything. And what I kind of want to understand is you mentioned that the beta is coming soon. Is there any sort of problems that still need to be figured out or is it more about just kind of focusing on the protocol level and then the UI and the desktop app? But are there any open challenges? Is this an extension of Git entirely and you're trying to move the data and kind of separate those out to be a bit more decentralized? Or is it more about there's still some open problems that will prevent this from kind of being true and they're being worked out kind of where do things tack on that level?
04:21:00.550 - 04:21:57.960, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely tons of things to figure out. I think that the beta is the first step towards getting to the vision of a decentralized code collaboration experience that could replace a centralized experience. And so it will be a progressive journey. Our beta will be the bare bones of sharing and hosting and creating identities, but will give us a space to start stress testing the protocol and the network with real data and real users and start having their input inform where our roadmap goes next. And so we plan on doing sequential releases post beta that start introducing more of those collaboration features and using the feedback that we're getting from that initial usage with these early adopters to inform that. But definitely tons of stuff. We talk about this a lot, is that radical link is very much so a research project.
04:21:57.960 - 04:22:19.402, Speaker B: We're building this amazing, beautiful experience, but behind it is like a very intense research project that is going to take a lot of maintenance and a lot of work to become the resilient network that we envision it to be. And so everything is a journey towards that.
04:22:19.536 - 04:23:10.878, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think it's one of those things where the effects of all that initial work compounds really efficiently and really well. So you're going to have to figure that out just once and then you can reap the benefits in perpetuity. That's amazing. I guess the other kind of question I have is as you are building the protocol, the desktop app and sort of talking about the risks of the current models that we have in this space, I'm curious what the reaction has been from the people you've talked to who would be ideal users here. And just generally, at kind of what point do they prefer convenience over other principles and kind of how do you think about trade offs on that or how that can be extended? It's a very open ending question. I can ask some specifics there too, but would love to just kind of start the conversation there.
04:23:11.044 - 04:23:56.202, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So there's, I think, two answers that I have to that question. First is that in our conversations and in our approach in general to Radical, I think the point isn't to replace, it is to enhance, it is to provide an alternative. And so I think that whenever we have conversations, although we do frame in contrast to centralized platforms, it's all about how we can build a great experience in the space that we're given. Right. GitHub, for example, as a platform, is a huge company, a huge brand. I don't think that a direct competitive approach to Radical versus GitHub will be productive for our users and for us.
04:23:56.202 - 04:25:43.670, Speaker B: So our goal is to tap into who understands this problem, who experiences this problem, and start building an experience for them and start understanding where does decentralized code collaboration lack right now and how can we be solving those problems? Because ultimately, if we do that, we will be creating an alternative to centralized code collaboration, but in a more directed way. So I think directing our energy towards that instead of pitching it again. Exactly. And then the second answer that I have about how people react, I think it's been really interesting to see how the sentiment around the centralization of co collaboration has been developing throughout even since I started at Radical. Honestly, the more news that comes out, the more you start to see people waking up and recognizing the reality of the situation. And specifically just recently with this YouTube downloader attack, it's wild because it starts getting people who didn't think about it before saying why is the RIA allowed to do that? Why is this direct attack on source code able to happen? And why is GitHub standing by it? And so I think we're just going to be seeing more of these situations that start getting people you don't really care until something happens to you. So I think that now in these conversations, it's been interesting to see how people have been evolving who maybe I talked to before and just brush it off, who are now kind of starting to understand it and who are interested in exploring alternatives.
04:25:43.830 - 04:26:14.326, Speaker A: No, absolutely. And it's also one of those things where if you work towards you a model where they don't have to think about what's happening in the background and from the screenshot. It does seem like they will not have to think about what's happening behind the scenes. They won't notice and they still get the benefit. So seems like everything seems to be on the right track. We had one more question from the chat, and that is, has Radical considered making a Dapnode package for an easy deployment of the platform so that others can also do this thing? Although it feels like an advertising, I.
04:26:14.348 - 04:26:39.230, Speaker B: Like it always advertise Dapnode. Whoever asked that should reach out to me and we can talk about it. We haven't explicitly thought about it, but could be super cool to explore that. I think that getting people using it, but then also getting people in the ecosystem, building on it, is number one, definitely on things that I want to do. So open call, reach out to me. DM me. We also have a discourse which is Radical Community.
04:26:39.230 - 04:26:43.280, Speaker B: Feel free to chime in, know we can talk through it.
04:26:43.650 - 04:27:01.094, Speaker A: We'll tell Jeff to definitely do that. And I think the last question I had for you, which I feel like he's sort of already addressed, but how can people sort of get involved? What are some of the things you need help with or anywhere from data testers to feedback to contributors, how can they kind of find you and the project?
04:27:01.292 - 04:27:24.430, Speaker B: Yeah, so you can follow us at Radical. I think it's underscore XYZ. Yeah, it's definitely at radical. It's in my profile and my handles on the presentation at Abby underscore Tickome. Reach out on Twitter, follow us, our beta. When it comes out, try it and let us know what you think. This will definitely be something that's a collective journey, that a shift in a narrative, something that we all need to build together.
04:27:24.430 - 04:27:30.586, Speaker B: So we're going to be looking for as much feedback and as much users as we can. As we start going into our release.
04:27:30.618 - 04:27:41.298, Speaker A: Timeline, there's already excitement on the chat that people want to use this thing immediately. So with that, I want to thank you for the presentation and we hope to use Radical soon.
04:27:41.464 - 04:27:42.770, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
04:27:42.920 - 04:28:36.310, Speaker A: Next up, I'd like to invite our next speaker and we'll have Isaac talk about the evolution of decentralized identity and just sort of how it's ready to make a big impact in our economy. So, without further ado, please welcome Isaac. Yeah, thank you very much. I'm very excited to be here and share this with you all today. So I'm just going to share my presentation and dive right in. So, yeah, as Kartik was saying today, what we're discussing is really the evolution of a decentralized identity over the last couple of years and the way that this community, that ethereum hackathon community, has really already started to see global impact and where we can go from here. So, first thing I want to call attention to is that there really has been a bit of a divergence since the 2017 crypto Community at the start of some of these ETH global events.
04:28:36.310 - 04:29:31.430, Speaker A: In the beginning we started out building everything as a smart contract. Making decentralized identities were just registries of account IDs, of ethereum addresses on the blockchain. And at the same time, a lot of other crypto projects were just starting out, like all the lending and banking. Since then, both spaces have matured, but pretty much independently. And I think that's because we're solving very different problems in the decentralized identity space, we're solving the problems of identifying everyone even where data is lacking. So the hundreds of millions of people around the globe that are excluded from traditional identity systems need an alternative way to identify themselves and just pull in all sorts of information that they can use to gain access to services. Traditional institutions like banks see these people as very high risk and expensive to onboard.
04:29:31.430 - 04:30:16.226, Speaker A: Typically with communities like this, there's very high rates of fraud. The fraud is very unique. There's entire industries built around fraud in these markets and as such, bureaus are not equipped to handle these individuals. Some of the examples are just like the introduction of the Sarasa credit scoring system in Brazil. There's certain dynamics that just don't work there, that did work in the US. There's families that will pool a credit profile and everybody shares the same credit profile. There's also the issues of Sarasa only storing negative data about people, so there's no way for people to pull in any positive environmental data about them and their activities to strengthen their identities.
04:30:16.226 - 04:31:19.226, Speaker A: So this problem is not necessarily solved by putting identity on chain. We have some problems which can be solved by blockchain solutions like uniquely identifying individual people or individual families. Of course, public key infrastructure is a great fit for that. But when it comes to sourcing data to strengthen these individual identities, it's not like there's a load of data that we can pull from contracts to say this person is a real person or anything about them. So after we onboard people to a public key infrastructure for identity, we still have a significant challenge of sourcing data through traditional means to strengthen their profiles. And third, as far as complying with legal privacy frameworks like Lgbd is the law in Brazil, CCPA in the US. GDPR in Europe, it's very challenging to approach storing any of this data with a smart contract system.
04:31:19.226 - 04:32:06.930, Speaker A: So I'd argue that they don't really need on chain identities yet. And in addition to that, we started out like I was saying is putting all of these identities on chain as like smart contracts and end user addresses. But it was very expensive and we weren't seeing a whole lot of value out of it. So I've pulled this graph from Google BigQuery. So this was Bloom's account registry contract in mid 2019. So every single person that signed up and downloaded the app, as soon as they signed up, we added a queue to broadcast a transaction that says, okay, we have a new user. This didn't really end up helping anything because these people weren't transacting on chain.
04:32:06.930 - 04:33:01.494, Speaker A: They didn't need to have their identity registered as part of a smart contract. All they really needed was a public private key pair to prove who they were. So you can see exactly when we realized, hey, we don't need to be spending this much every day registering every single new user on chain. That's not to say that identity is completely independent from the blockchain, it's off chain, but it really is adjacent to the entire ecosystem. Everything in the decentralized identity space is being built using the same blockchain fundamentals as many other projects. So under the hood, a decentralized Identifier is typically just a wrapped ethereum wallet or bitcoin wallet. And it's using the exact same message signing capabilities that are used for sending transactions, but it's only used for signing messages and doing things like updating keys and other did operations.
04:33:01.494 - 04:33:49.654, Speaker A: So I pulled the trust wallet in here because the same Trustwallet libraries that you can use to make a fund holding account, you can use to make an identity wallet, and indeed many identity wallets do use this under the hood. The space has matured a lot, as I was saying, since 2017. It's not just a collection of smart contracts and account registries like it was in the beginning. There is quite a bit of maturity here. So the W three C decentralized Identity Foundation, trust over IP Foundation within the Linux Foundation and more. We've all started really aligning on what the terms are for referring to not just individual, but also enterprise identity. There's the concept of an issuer which issues a credential to a user or a holder.
04:33:49.654 - 04:35:10.146, Speaker A: A holder can register a did or a decentralized Identifier. All the data that they get associated with their public key is stored in a data vault or a hub and then that can be accessed by applications when the user consents to share. So the concepts here we heard from EY about the concept of attestations and indeed when we started out we were referring to everything as attestations. But now, just to get you all familiar with the terminology, we're talking about DIDs for individuals, verifiable credentials for data that we're associating with DIDs and Verifiable presentations. When users are sharing data with third party applications, these are the important terms that you'll see coming up over and over again throughout the decentralized identity space. Now, how does it actually look to have data routed through a user's wallet? So this is just an example of on the left I have an identity wallet, on the right I have an application that is requesting data from me. So inside of the QR is encoded information saying who is requesting data from you and exactly what are they requesting? So in this case, this website on the right is requesting information about my watch list status and my ID document verification and my email.
04:35:10.146 - 04:36:28.906, Speaker A: So this information, as you can imagine back on the previous diagram, the data comes out of the data vault. It gets packaged and it gets shared as a presentation to the third party. All data gets routed through users and all recipients can verify that it came from the issuing party as the space is becoming standardized enough so that big tech is even getting involved. So Verifiable credentials aren't just something you can do in the crypto space, but even on the Azure platform now you can pull in an OIDC Credential that you would use for a traditional authentication and you can turn it into a Credential and associate it with a bitcoin based did. So we heard a Bit two presentations ago about Microsoft's involvement in the space and indeed they have adopted and are supporting a lot of the standards here. Big tech involvement is not always a huge plus in the decentralization space, but it is great for at least pulling in massive amounts of data that we'll need if we really want to see adoption here. I wanted to talk now about some places that we're already seeing impact from decentralized identity in the global space around the world.
04:36:28.906 - 04:37:21.062, Speaker A: So, Good Worker is a company that is just launching, that they launched earlier this year and they're a job and skills marketplace based out of India. In the short term, their goal is very simple. There is a ton of inefficiencies in the seasonal worker blue collar marketplace for Indian workers. Say that you're an individual with experience in the textile space and you need a job for the next six months or so. Right now that market is full of a lot of inefficient brokers and just overall challenges and high costs. So in the near term, what this platform is doing is using DIDs and Verifiable credentials to give people reusable Verifiable data about their identity, where they live, what their skills are and what their income is. In the near term, this will allow them to find better jobs, but in the long term, it allows them to get instant access to any adjacent service using the same data.
04:37:21.062 - 04:38:30.194, Speaker A: You can use the same data that you would use to get a job, to get a loan, or to get a home. So this is an example of how decentralized identity is already having an impact on the ground for seasonal workers in India who they don't have ETH or crypto or anything, but what they do have is DIDs and Verifiable credentials. On the enterprise side, we're also seeing adoption. So Tristana is a company based out of Southeast Asia, offices in China and Singapore where they're building a cross border trade network. So here it's not data that is being associated with individuals, but when buyers and suppliers transact on this platform, they're actually building up a rich decentralized identity profile containing information about what they're qualified to trade, who they're trading with, their volume of trade. And they can use, again, all of this same reusable Verifiable rich data to get access to adjacent services. So a shipper might or a supplier might want to get access to financing on their invoices even before their goods arrive in the next port.
04:38:30.194 - 04:39:47.760, Speaker A: All of this is possible if we have this decentralized rich data ecosystem. A third place that we're already seeing a lot of global impact is in the health field. So again, in Southeast Asia, we're seeing a lot of travel restricted for workers that are trying to travel across borders or get into job sites. So governments and labs are already working together to see how can we use decentralized identities and Verifiable credentials to give people the ability to cross borders, get onto job sites, and open up borders that are currently closed due to risks of infection. So this is something that is of course very helpful right now. But what's more interesting to me is imagine now that we have these doctors offices that are equipped to give you portable Verifiable health information about yourself that you take custody of, what are the possibilities that you could do with that type of information? To me, anything involving the research space where I can actually consent to give my data for different medical studies or just making it so that I can move between doctors offices quicker. Making this data reusable has a lot more implications than just the near term benefit of improving cross border travel.
04:39:47.760 - 04:40:35.258, Speaker A: As I was saying that this is all really possible due to the ETH hackathon community. I've been working with people in this space primarily that I've met through hackathons back a few years ago when I quit my normal job to become a solidity developer. It was after I joined the f dev subreddit hackathon. Soon after that I was at the ETH San Francisco hackathon, where I met all the people that I ended up working with for the rest for my career until now. Same with ETH Berlin and DevCon and ETH Denver and ETH New York. So there's many more ETH events than just the ones on the screen. These are just all the ones that I have specific memories and partnerships that have grown out of this ethereum hackathon community.
04:40:35.258 - 04:41:27.482, Speaker A: To me, it's absolutely the most important thing in my career and also in this space. It's also true that the Decentralized Identity Foundation companies, many of the people that are working there and that you'll find in the Decentralized Identity Foundation slack met each other through this community as well. So a lot of the companies that are listed here on the right, these people started out in the straight ethereum space, but have now branched off into building decentralized identity technology. And this really brings me back to my original point of this divergence. So we have the 2020 crypto community, which is incredibly mature, tons of value locked in it. And we have the 2020 Decentralized Identity community, which similarly is onboarding tons and tons of individuals. But these two aren't really talking to each other.
04:41:27.482 - 04:42:23.726, Speaker A: DFI doesn't have necessarily a big need for identity yet. It's more of a nice to have, but it's not essential to how these protocols are functioning. What I want to understand is what can we build together? So we have all these people that we're onboarding, the unbanked, the underemployed, the people that can't travel, and on the other side, we have all of these DeFi products that people are locking value into. What can we do if we can bring these two concepts together by bridging the decentralized identity and the decentralized finance spaces? I want to call out two of the project submissions we actually got from this hackathon, which were particularly exciting to me. So the first one is Trafficuard. They call themselves an inclusive supply chain trade finance tool. This, you'll notice, is directly analogous to that Trustana use case that I mentioned a few slides ago.
04:42:23.726 - 04:43:25.970, Speaker A: The goal of this is to make it so somebody can take their verified identity through a decentralized identity platform. In this case, they were using the Bloom application to prove the person's credit worthiness on the platform. So first, an individual can say that there's a seller that has goods that are on their way to a buyer's location, but they want to unlock some funds before the goods have actually been delivered. They can provide all of the verified documents to this platform to say, I have this credit score, I am this person. And these are some verified documents showing that I have goods on the rate of the destination. They can actually then lock up funds in a compound contract and borrow against it at a variable rate depending on their credit worthiness. So this is really only possible if we can bring together the data from the industries and the data from the individual people at the companies together with the DeFi protocols to allow for this type of dynamic lending.
04:43:25.970 - 04:44:24.742, Speaker A: One other submission that we got during this hackathon that I'm really excited about is called Molecule. So this protocol is making it so that people can prove their KYC status in a privacy preserving way, again using decentralized identity. What they get in return is an NFT representing their KYC status. What you can do then is bake into certain exchanges or DeFi platforms, things that will only transact with you if you are holding a certain NFT. Very simple concept in theory. But like, the idea that we could bridge all of the data from the Decentralized Identity ecosystem into something that mints NFTs and then restricts people's ability to interact with certain platforms based on those NFTs to me seems incredibly powerful. What other things can we build together? This is really a question I have for this audience in particular.
04:44:24.742 - 04:46:29.680, Speaker A: I've spent a lot of ETH online understanding how can we actually compose all of the building blocks from DeFi with all the building blocks from decentralized identity? Can we provide even more widespread access to stable crypto assets for individuals that live in very unstable markets? Maybe there's exchanges that want to work with these individuals, but there is no traditional way to gather the data to do business with them. Are there other sophisticated DeFi products that could use this type of decentralized identity and just decentralized data in general to make decisions? What can we build using this type of data? And third, some sort of safer DeFi on ramp for CFI users? There's all sorts of people that have seen a lot of the hype around DeFi over the summer and want exposure to these systems, but they would prefer to have a platform with training wheels. Is there some sort of KYC platform opportunity that can pull in the best of the decentralized identity community to make DeFi a bit more approachable? Some of the specific things that I was exploring even today is the concept of ave's delegated credit vaults. So this is something that I would love to see built. Where can a delegated credit vault holder who has deposited money into it, can they be doing their proprietary risk assessments off chain and only whitelist borrowers to draw from a line of credit on chain? So just a very simple thing where you take the decentralized identity on ramp with a delegated credit vault and then you actually have an unsecured fully integrated lending product. Many more ideas like this, but this is what I want to hear from you. So if you want to build something at the intersection of identity and crypto, please reach out and we'd love to hear from you.
04:46:29.680 - 04:47:37.300, Speaker A: Thank you so much. That was an awesome talk. I actually did not know that that everything started in San Francisco for you. So this is amazing to hear and I want to thank you for giving back to the community. Bloom has been a big part of passive global events, so this is really awesome to hear. We have a few questions coming in from the chat, but one question I have for you is just in general, you sort of touched on this thing, but I guess I'm just curious to hear more thoughts on how do you kind of think about introducing a decentralized identity, or rather on the blockchain side of it for Geographies, where there isn't sort of a government issued identity system and a lot of countries are in that position? How do you think about that transition happening? Do you think that the government needs to sort of standardize that process for all the citizens first and then we move it to online? Or do you think peer to peer approach will just work at scale? There's certainly both those approaches, right? Because there's a lot of countries that are a lot more sophisticated with digital identity solutions. Which can plug right in.
04:47:37.300 - 04:48:55.258, Speaker A: Aadhaar has its faults with data quality, but it's actually very simple to transition an Aadhaar ID to a did with Verifiable credentials. Or similarly in Singapore, you have like, SingPass, where you can have all this verified data about you. So in those cases, I've actually been surprised to learn that there is fairly sophisticated digital ID solutions that we can turn into decentralized identity on ramps in many countries. The alternative to that. The approach that I would love to see is how can in my day to day life, when I'm transacting, say, I go to the same shop every single day and I'm buying the same groceries from the same person every week, can we in some way enable a point of sale type solution at that vendor? To say, I'm giving you a credential that says you clearly have stable enough income that you're buying from me groceries every day for the last five years. Why isn't that good enough to form the basis of an identity? So it's not just peer to peer staking, but it's like enabling the people at the edges to be issuing these types of credentials to each other. And so, just to clarify, is there a difference in this being called identity versus calling it issuing the credit? I guess my question makes sense.
04:48:55.258 - 04:49:34.840, Speaker A: It's more about like, if you look in this scenario, it's like, oh, can I just pay you back later? And you get sort of that assurance. But does that help with the identity piece as well? Yes. When you would really want to extend credit to somebody, right. If you're pretty sure that they're a real person that has a steady income flow. So to me, these credentials form the identity that would make it so that you would actually want to extend credit to this person. And then having just a very generic on ramp where this is somebody that I feel comfortable doing business with, then perhaps I can whitelist them on my delegated credit vault and they can take loans for me. Got it.
04:49:34.840 - 04:50:20.840, Speaker A: And I guess the last question I have for you is what have been sort of surprising things as you've tried to make this work for Bloom and kind of what have things you found out that work, I guess, across the world, but not in the US. And vice versa, and just sort of some interesting tidbits from there. Oh, sure. So some of the early surprises were, let's see, I'll go back to an experience I had at ETH Denver, which is the shirt I'm wearing on purpose. It's when we arrived at ETH Denver as a sponsor, we had to register at the sponsor table with the app. And I was thinking like, oh, that's interesting. I can get my credential from Uport and I can sign in and I can go to all the East Denver parties by using the Uport app.
04:50:20.840 - 04:51:21.066, Speaker A: For some reason, that experience sticks out in my mind as like interoperability being very important. Up until that point, I thought, okay, we'll just make the Bloom account smart contract and people can interact within the Bloom ecosystem. But then we're not really benefiting from the fact that the folks like Ucord and all of the 60 plus other companies in the space are out there working with governments, working with solutions. If we position ourselves as more of an interoperable solution, then anyone could just use the Bloom identity wallet in any case where they could use another one. So one of the early surprises was know, I didn't pay enough attention to interoperability perhaps in the first six months, but after that, you can really benefit from the wider industry. And then I guess the other surprise doing this stuff abroad, like in Asia or in Latin America is in Asia. I think a big thing is just how robust the government infrastructure is for some of this stuff.
04:51:21.066 - 04:52:05.238, Speaker A: The willingness and ability to adopt technology and identify all of their citizens with digital technology seems much more advanced than we have in the US. And then in markets like Brazil, seeing just all the ways that fraud is an entire industry. So seeing the way that people understand how to game systems. It's a very similar idea to how you have to design smart contracts. Because when you design smart contracts, it's almost adversarial where you're thinking, like, what are all the ways somebody could try to exploit this? It's the same way that you actually have to design a banking or identity solution on the ground for real people in a country like Brazil. No, that's awesome. I think that's a really good point.
04:52:05.238 - 04:52:34.014, Speaker A: Until you point that out. It was not obvious to me either. But you don't want to set up where everybody's competing for the same audience in a zero sum game if everybody's come up with their own identity solution and interoperability is a key differentiator here. Awesome. Well, with that, I want to thank you for giving us your time today and an amazing talk. We are running a little bit ahead of schedule, which is great. So what we'll do is we'll just kind of do a quick five minute break for everybody on the chat.
04:52:34.014 - 04:59:02.502, Speaker A: And for those of you who are watching this on live, I hope you get to enjoy some quick D Five Beats or Lo Fi Beats. So enjoy the radio and we'll be back in five minutes. You all right? I hope all of you took a quick break and I enjoyed some of our Lo fi beats. We are ready to move on to our next talk. And this is a talk I'm particularly excited about. And our next talk is going to be Ronil, who's going to be talking about the future of streaming and audience. So it's been a pretty interesting week for him and audience.
04:59:02.502 - 04:59:34.038, Speaker A: And there's a lot of things that have happened this week in the world of entertainment. And without further ado, I'll let Ronil kick off and tell us about what's welcome, Ronil. Hey, hey. Thanks so much for having me. Karthik and everyone watching, thanks so much for taking the time. I'm excited to share a little bit more about what we've been up to lately. And then more broadly, I think kind of keep the focus here on what's been happening in our community with community ownership in general.
04:59:34.038 - 05:00:42.122, Speaker A: It's been, I think, just a really exciting kind of undercurrent of use cases that are emerging around how we can build the next generation of platforms in a way that actually enfranchises the users of those platforms with control of the underlying protocol and community. To kick us off, though, actually I did want to take a minute to recognize we've had some really cool folks submit stuff under the audience. Prizes in the hackathon and catalog, ended up being the winner. Dbeats and Eero were the two runner ups that we selected. All really cool projects. I would suggest you try them out and play around. I think it's a really cool way to kind of show how we can kind of help artists start to engage with some of the concepts that us as the ETH community have been developing for so long.
05:00:42.122 - 05:01:43.920, Speaker A: So yeah, just wanted to take a moment to recognize those just as a quick background, like what is Audius? For many of you all, this might be the first time you're hearing about us. We're a digital streaming service that connects fans directly with artists and exclusive new music. That direct is the key piece though, so audience is fully decentralized. It's been operated by the community for the last year or so since we launched. And just last week actually, there was the protocol crossed over into being mainnet, basically the actual token powering, the protocol being live, actual value, being able to change hands in the system. So we're really excited about that. And yeah, this is just an example of an artist's profile on Audius so they can upload tracks, share this profile out with folks, folks can come, discover, consume it.
05:01:43.920 - 05:03:14.234, Speaker A: The big question this probably raises is like, why do we care about decentralized music or community owned music distribution? Just put very simply, the way that the music industry is structured from kind of a revenue perspective is, I think, reflective of the more systemic issues there around the number of middlemen and the amount of control that is exerted by folks who are not actually the ones creating music and creating the stuff that is actually driving all of this interesting behavior. Right, so artists only capture 12% of music revenue today and that's really what audience exists to change, to allow artists to own their own means of digital distribution. So, yeah, as I mentioned, we launched publicly in September 2019 and really excited to share. Today actually, or yesterday officially was when we first. For the first time crossed over a million monthly listeners on Audience. So that means in the last 30 days, over a million people came to Audience and listened to music. Here we've had 150,000 tracks shared by 40,000 artists and we see over 40 million requests to the Audience API to pull content, pull metadata, pull whatever every month right now.
05:03:14.234 - 05:05:11.250, Speaker A: So all of our stats are public because all of the nodes that run on the network are public. And you can actually just go to the dashboard audience link there and see in real time what's happening, what tracks are trending, who's sharing stuff. And it's been just really cool, I think, to see a lot of kind of household names in music actually getting really excited about decentralization and the web3 tech that our whole community has been working on together for so long. So to get into this kind of the actual meat of what I'm excited to talk about here is what we tried to build with this initial launch of the Audience token that happened last Friday was a means to more scalably and equitably distribute ownership among the users of a platform over time, right? And we're not the first ones to do this. There are a lot of experiments that have happened in our community and I think Uniswaps recently was one of the most successful, right, where they actually were able to kind of look at retroactive usage of Uniswap and kind of basically kind of reward that behavior proportionally in Audience. We kind of tried to adapt that way of thinking to what are the kind of top users of a music service, right? In our case, there was basically a formula that determined kind of a score or relative score to other users based on tracks, shared, number of followers, number of times you've engaged with other content on Audience, and a number of other things. And it was just really cool to see all of these artists and creators on our network actually starting to learn about and engage with crypto for the first time in this way.
05:05:11.250 - 05:07:31.182, Speaker A: So audience has been decentralized since our launch in September 2019, but a lot of that detail I think we were able to abstract away from the end user quite effectively, using things like metatransactions and other flows such that all of those interactions were actually making their way on chain, oftentimes to this kind of ethereum side chain called POA Network that many of you all are likely familiar with. But in this case, we were actually able to use that metatransaction flow to kind of let people see, oh, I have audio tokens to claim, they could click claim and claim those into their wallet, which is a noncustodial wallet that every user of Audius has had since creating an account. So, yeah, it ended up being just, I think, a really neat moment for our community and I think sets the stage going forward solidifying the expected uses of the token, which the three are kind of governance. So voting on changes to the protocol, securing the protocol, so staking on those nodes that I mentioned that are hosting content and hosting metadata and feature access, so artists can actually stake these tokens to access additional features within audience over time. So I guess going forward, I'm really excited to see how both our community, the audience community, as well as other projects within our broader ETH and crypto community, start to think about distributing ownership in ways that actually sort of enfranchise users in the growth of the tools that they're helping to build value in. Right? And yeah, I think we are among the first, I think, to be doing this for a more end user consumery product. The level of education that had to happen, sorry, among our user base was quite a bit higher than I think it was for a lot of DeFi projects, for example, that have done similar things.
05:07:31.182 - 05:08:47.080, Speaker A: But yeah, I think the thing I just really want to call out here is I think audience is a small part of this, but more broadly in our community, we're at this kind of inflection point where the ethos and idea of community ownership is one that we all have the tools now to put actual effort towards realizing these things. Right. In the case of Audience, the way that made the most sense to execute this was via Issuance over time. So there are 70 to 100 million new audio tokens minted every year by the network and those get distributed to the community via staking and via other mechanics that the community has the opportunity to vote on and vote into place over time. That's about it. I wanted to keep some time here for questions, so I'll kind of kick things back over there. But thank you all for listening, thank you all for stopping through and excited to be here and be part of this whole community.
05:08:47.080 - 05:09:18.814, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Ronil, this is super exciting to hear. I feel like you're downplaying this a little bit, but it's a huge milestone for you and the team. A million users is nothing small, of amazing and incredible. So congrats on reaching that by far absolutely the biggest DAP that there is in the web3 ecosystem. So congrats. Thank you so much.
05:09:18.814 - 05:10:21.846, Speaker A: Karthik so we do have a couple of questions coming in. The first one I have is who are some of these artists that you'd really love to adopt kind of audience and just a decentralized platform in general as kind of their first choice and sort of how do you go about pitching it to them as a platform? Yeah, it's a great question. I think we really serving a broad spectrum of users. Everyone from kind of the bedroom producer, DJ, rapper, who's just making music for the first time and wants to have someplace to share it and have an equal opportunity to build a following in the same way that platforms in the past had allowed before, changing rules on folks and things like this, right. All the way up to kind know, we do have a number of larger artists that I highlighted there, like Skrillex Russ, for example, just uploaded some content to Audius for the first time. R. L.
05:10:21.846 - 05:11:31.898, Speaker A: Grimes Halloween mix that he puts out every year is out on Audius right now. If anyone's into that, definitely go check it out. So we really want audience to serve as this tool to build and own a following and then monetize that following how you see fit as an artist. Right. And I think that need is one that spans all sizes of artists, right. At the small end of the spectrum, the need is really to find your audience and find your footing on what are the types of things that you enjoy making that you're able to start to find an audience that also enjoys listening to. And then at the bigger end of things, the sort of lines of questioning and thinking from artists starts to move more towards, like, how does owning my audience actually help me be better from a business perspective? How does this help me actually have a better business? Right? And I think that is fulfilling that side of things is the challenge for our community going forward.
05:11:31.898 - 05:12:28.160, Speaker A: But I think this drop that happened last Friday was a really important first step there. Like, we heard so much great feedback from artists across the spectrum saying things like this gave them the confidence to continue working on music full time when they were getting ready to give it up, for example. Or there were just so many things that I think for artists to get to see their work rewarded in a really meaningful way right. When oftentimes artists just have been so, I guess mistreated generally by platforms of the past. That's what makes them so excited about just having a seat at the table, right. That's like all they want. And it's heartbreaking to hear the stories of what would have happened elsewhere, but we feel really fortunate to have this opportunity.
05:12:28.160 - 05:13:37.438, Speaker A: No, that's really amazing to hear. I think it is very much about finding a platform and people that believe in you, and you kind of made that case really obvious for everybody. We do have a couple more questions, so I'll just kind of ask them in order and we'll see, kind of based on time, how many more we can go into. But there's clearly a lot of new advantages now in the Web three world, especially as audience uses the best of both and kind of how do you think about audience and just in general, the more decentralized, streaming platform? Sort of integrating and innovating on top of things like NFTs and kind of introducing visual arts on top of just music and entertainment and curious to see if you've ever explored any of those things before or what may or may not be possible. Yeah, so the coolest part about audience, and I think about decentralized web platforms more generally, is that anyone can build anything they want on these things, right. There is no kind of audience private API as such. Like, when you think about how SoundCloud, for example, there are features that are available within the SoundCloud app that are not in their API.
05:13:37.438 - 05:14:09.806, Speaker A: The API that the first party client, the open source first party client consumes is the same one that everyone else gets, right? All of that is there. So as a natural next step from that, we've already had a bunch of folks start to experiment with things like Audio NFTs that are hosted on Audius, so you can upload tracks privately to Audius and actually use sort of the decentralized hosting part of this protocol to host an Audio NFT, with that being the first step. What was that?
05:14:09.828 - 05:14:10.110, Speaker B: Sorry.
05:14:10.180 - 05:15:08.794, Speaker A: That's a super cool idea. I just I don't think yeah, and then the step beyond that is actually like with the Audius kind of content permissioning primitives, you could start to have Audio NFTs that are only playbackable by the person holding the NFT, for example, or maybe whoever they designate. So I guess the broader or the more precise answer to your question is we see audience as this kind of platform building block that can serve the use case of streaming really well. But our community's ambition is not to go do everything for everyone. I think there are a ton of folks in our community who've already stepped up to say, like, this is something I want to build and I'm just going to go do it. And that's the coolest thing to see, right? Because we can't do it. All our team working on this and even our own community, which is the tens of thousands of artists and a few thousand folks in Discord and elsewhere.
05:15:08.794 - 05:15:44.406, Speaker A: There's just too much to do for us, right? Yeah. That's incredible. Well, we are running out of time, so I will have to move on to the next talk. But Ronil, I wish you all the best with scaling audience even more. And we hope to hear the 2 million monthly active user announcements soon and I really hope we can get Kanye to message you shortly. Well, you all will hear about the 2 million user, mark first, Karthik and everyone at E Global, thanks so much for having me. Thank you so much and all the best with everything else going on this week for audience.
05:15:44.406 - 05:16:23.480, Speaker A: So thanks again. And with that, we are ready to move on to our next talk. And this is one I'm super excited about. This will be a conversation between Austin and Kale and they'll be talking about sort of what actually gets enabled and unlocked by developers in the world of Ethereum and Austin and Kale have been in this community for quite some time and they have a lot of amazing insights. So I'll just sort of let them kind of come on stage and get the conversation started. So with that, please welcome Austin and Kale. How's it going guys? Hello.
05:16:23.480 - 05:17:09.062, Speaker A: This really is just going to be a right like our plan was. Let's not plan anything, let's not put a bullet point list. Let's just go back and forth and wrap about building on ethereum and I like what that unlocks too. I think earlier I heard someone mention something about like we keep building the same web two thing over and over on web3 and that's really not the answer here. So it'll be cool to talk about what things are also unique to web3 and then I think Kale in particular you like to dive into and you have some great perspective here on kind of public versus private and also enterprise versus public. Maybe you want to jump in on that first and start driving the boat and we'll see where we go from there also. Yeah, thanks for having us.
05:17:09.062 - 05:18:07.660, Speaker A: ETH global. Yeah, thanks everyone for having us on here and talked to Austin quite a bit and a bunch of others in the community around this. But being from Microsoft, I spend quite a bit of time on the enterprise side. But over time and I've always been a big believer that public main net is something that is going to be embraced by enterprises and that's happening, it's already happened, but we're seeing more of it, right, with things like baseline and some other projects that are spinning. So in the back of my mind, as we've been building stuff at Microsoft for this as part of the community and whatnot, it's always been a thing to make sure our tools are compatible. When we talk about DevTools between both, we don't try to make something that's just going to work for private networks. It may have some features that are kind of centered around that, but the core is always to be open, right? To be able to have that reach into the public side too.
05:18:07.660 - 05:19:25.246, Speaker A: The open source nature of the ecosystem is so cool, just like judging hackathon projects every once in a while and I am guilty of it myself. When I try to build something, you get this really big ambitious pitch of what we want to build and when you get in and you start building something, there are some holes along the way, right? You find these missing pieces and you end up having to focus on building that tooling, but then you kind of provide that back to the open source ecosystem and that becomes a building block for the next folks that come along that want to build there. I know that you guys have some extensions and stuff. What kind of stuff are you like, what in the private world gets built and then pushed back up to the open source level where other people can tinker around with it. Yeah, it's a great thing and I agree 100% and I've been in those hackathons myself in the same seat. It's like, great, we're going to build this decentralized X, right? And we started building it and next thing you know it's like we're in wallets and that's where we live for the next three days. And it's like after seeing that a few times and also working with customers on that, they do hit the same things, right? Everybody's hitting those same kind of bumps.
05:19:25.246 - 05:20:04.926, Speaker A: So one of the things we were trying to do with some of our Vs code work and some of the SDKs that we built is kind of lower that bar to entry. So the idea is enable people to do stuff fast so it's not like a black box, like they don't know what's going on, but if they want to be kind of oblivious when they first get started and say, hey, I just want to build something. I want to write some solidity code, I want to get this thing up onto maybe a dev network or something even bigger, like something in Azure or something. We want to make that right click, right? Just right click. Deploy that thing out there and get going. But we also don't want to restrict it, right. And say that's the only way you can do it.
05:20:04.926 - 05:20:37.754, Speaker A: And pay no attention to the man behind the curtain that was doing all that stuff for you. For the advanced users, I want them to be able to go, that's cool, but I already know how that works and I want to tweak something and I want to get in there so then they can get in there and do that and we're not getting in their way. So that's I feel like that's like the magic, right, to making some of these tools is like make it easy for guys who are like novices who don't know what they're doing. And like you said, remove some of those stumbling blocks that's going to block them, but then don't lock the other guys down. Right. We got to make sure that it works great for advanced user, the champions. Yeah, it's hard to know.
05:20:37.754 - 05:21:28.986, Speaker A: One just really specific thing is my inferior key. When I distribute Scaffold ETH, I want to take care of as much for you as I can and I want you to get in there and start poking around right away and really start making queries on main net, which means I need that infrastructure. But with my infuria key I just plug it into my repo and send it out to people. And so all these other people are using my infuria key and infuria is like, what the heck is going on here? So it's funny, they just put me on the Rickmoo plan, which is the ethers JS. It must be how it's distributed or something like that. But the infuria key will come with Scaffold ETH and it will work for a little bit, but then it'll shut down on your IP address pretty quickly. And so that's just another piece of that infrastructure that I keep talking about.
05:21:28.986 - 05:22:32.682, Speaker A: Our tooling is sort of I've been saying this for probably six months, so maybe it has already happened. But we really are at this changing point in terms of our tooling where the tools aren't just built to get the job done anymore, they're built to get the job done well and also be a delightful experience for the developer. And I think the ethereum space in particular is finally hitting that stride where we have tools like Biddler cross out Hard Hat, where you can compile and deploy your contracts and get console logs and get a lot more information into the EVM and a lot more just like exposure to what the heck is going on within your solidity. And I think that is a sign of a lot of other tools. I think they're even working on a Vs code extension. I don't know if they've reached out to you yet, but I bet the Nomic Labs guys will be hitting you up for that. Yeah, the other thing, it's a little bit of a plug for Austin, but I'm going to go ahead and do it anyway because I got a plug chilling and chilling.
05:22:32.682 - 05:23:30.974, Speaker A: Owalkie would be proud of us. Yeah, the videos that Austin's put time in on ETH build, if people haven't seen that and again, this is not like I'm not trying to pimp something or anything like that. I'm just saying if you're somebody who can basically break down how a wallet works, how a transaction works, how some of these core primitives that you need when you're doing a know, you need to understand these things. Austin's amazing at that, right? Which means he really understands the ecosystem really well because the only people who can really explain it very simply and have those tools to do it is someone like Austin. So hats off to that stuff and I highly recommend that for people who are just getting started with Web three, go check it out because you need to understand some of these primitives. What are these keys and how do they work? Now to kind of parlay that into enterprise side, one thing we've worked on for a while has been things like HSMs, which are hardware security modules inside the cloud. Those things are really hard for you to do on Prem, right.
05:23:30.974 - 05:23:58.874, Speaker A: You have to have a lot of money first off to buy one of these things and they're like a crazy programming language, so there's quite a bit of stuff there to run and we make that dead simple, like in the cloud. And that's one thing I feel like really crosses that bridge between public and private. Right? We build private networks utilizing that stuff. They could also be used on public ones. Right? You need a good place to store your key. You need a good place to mint your key so it never leaves the HSM. We got that there, right? So little plug for Azure there.
05:23:58.874 - 05:24:46.374, Speaker A: But I think that's some of the areas where we work on to try to bridge that gap. The other side is a little bit like kind of what Austin works on a lot, which I will call like low code kind of deployments. We have know things if you're familiar with Azure functions or even in Amazon if you understand lambda, where we have these serverless pieces of code that can run. We build a lot of connectors over there for Ethereum as well, which work public, private, doesn't really matter. You just need an RPC endpoint and some counts to use. And you can essentially deploy smart contracts, call them, and very little code to write, right? You can use some tooling to basically generate the Abis, like compile them and things like that. You bring it up to this tool, it plugs everything in, it can interrogate that and tell you what methods you got and you can start calling methods on them.
05:24:46.374 - 05:25:33.894, Speaker A: And you don't have to write a lot of infrastructure code. I think I saw you do a demo of this one time. Maybe you and I were on a zoom and it was kind of like form feeling like you were orchestrating this infrastructure but in a very Web two kind of wiring things up way. It was very cool. And it's funny how that infrastructure, when we're trying to provide it for a developer going back kind of rewinding to the infuria thing and what we provide for them and what we don't provide for them and we're thinking about a docker container for Scaffold ETH right now. And I've been asking developers like, is a docker container too much? And I would say about 25% of them are just like a hard no on installing that docker container. And we're thinking once we dockerize one thing, we can have all sorts of things.
05:25:33.894 - 05:26:12.562, Speaker A: Like you could have a local Block Explorer, you could have a local Node running on whatever network you want to have, right? Like once you have one docker container, you could really do a lot there. But then you got to convince them to download that extra infrastructure to run the docker container and stuff like that. I guess I don't really have a question there. It's just kind of like that's one thing that we're working on is like if we took that container, we could deploy it and we could give them a web experience at first and then maybe they transition to a local dev environment. And you see that on Ethereum.org too. That would be a good plug right now, if you're a developer thinking about getting into Ethereum, of course Ethereum.org
05:26:12.562 - 05:27:35.866, Speaker A: Developers is a great portal for that and there's a lot of great resources there to get started. We were trying to kind of do in public and private blockchain. I was thinking we could talk about so the tooling going between the two kind of is agnostic, right? It's going to work either way. What about like security or attacks? We've talked a lot today, we've heard it a lot, the flash loans, right? When someone figures out because that to me, I think I just learned about it at ETH Denver, like what the heck a flash loan even is. And then once you understand it's like, whoa, what else can we do with this? And when a new paradigm like that enters the scene and they do so quickly because things are moving so fast in Ethereum, how does that look on the private side? How does that look like on the enterprise side? Are they thinking, well, are they going to flash loan this or is it even a concern? Yeah, I think there's always interest there, right. So a lot of enterprise, when they hear about these things that are happening in the news, typically when they say like, oh, this DeFi thing is blowing up and things like that to be like, so should we be doing that? It's like, okay, we should probably talk about what it actually means. Are you building tokenized assets and things like that that could use some of those technologies.
05:27:35.866 - 05:28:51.958, Speaker A: But I think one big thing, especially from a security standpoint, when people start building apps, especially if they're really serious about it, it's not just some sort of like POC or proof of concept or something is using things that people have built standing on the shoulder of giants, like open Zeppelin type stuff, right? So when we have these nuggets of really goodness out here for smart contracts, a lot of people, especially when you first get started, they don't know where that stuff is and they tend to have to build that themselves and then they're going through a lot of pain, right, to kind of get that through. So that's one thing we try to plug into our tooling as well. And there's others, open Zeppelin is just one of them. But having audited snippets or full contracts that people can use and take advantage of and have a strong versioning thing around, that's awesome, right? And that's going to help people not trip over themselves as they're trying to do transfers and they don't understand what that means and how do they protect against some of these type of attacks. Because the reality is at first people were like, well, doesn't really matter because it's a private network, so we're all among friends here, there's not going to be a problem. But as soon as we start talking about public main net like, oh, we got to be careful here. Now if these contracts are actually going to go out on main net now we do have to consider those things.
05:28:51.958 - 05:29:26.322, Speaker A: So we've kind of been pushing quite a bit for saying, hey, just do it from the start, right? Just pretend that you're on public main net because you're probably going to be there at some point. And I think, yeah, Paul Brody actually, he kind of alluded to that. It's basically like it's going to end up on it's so fun to hear. It warms my heart so much to hear all these enterprise guys say it's going to be on Ethereum like 50%. Did he say that? 50% in the next ten years? Something like that. But he's saying basically you're going to be on a private network or public network. Private technology is growing though, right? There's a lot of interesting things going on.
05:29:26.322 - 05:30:18.226, Speaker A: So public network, but with a lot of privacy tech maybe involved with that also. But yeah, with the attacks, that could be really interesting. The Open Zeppelin thing really reminds me of kind of I do a lot of mentorship with developers and when we're just writing solidity and kind of getting going, I show them the ownership pattern. But when you can just carve all that code out and that's just a little bit of code, when you can carve all that code out and just put in like, oh, this is ownable now. And you get that audited code from OpenZeppelin. You get that right out of the box and you see that it works, then it's like, oh, what other tools do I have? And it's just like you said, you can just go through the Open Zeppelin repo and find all the different tokens and find all the different access models that have been poured over by many developers and researchers in the space that have really audited these contracts. Maybe auditing is even a good thing to talk about.
05:30:18.226 - 05:31:14.600, Speaker A: Auditing is really tough right now. You can hear a lot of the hackathon hackers talk about how they're hoping to raise money to get audited and it's like, oh man, they should be raising money for their developers to be building stuff. Auditing should not be so hard. But audits are still really tough in our ecosystem. Is it different between public and private or enterprise and not no, it's a big deal, right? Especially when it's something even if it's not public yet, like on public main net, if you're working with something like a financial institution on some of these apps, it's heavily audited, right? They have to basically go over all that stuff and make sure there's no loopholes and it's heavily poured over and they will spend quite a bit of money to have those things audited by third parties. So, yeah, there's a good business model there for those who are building this, right? That's why it's so hard. All these auditors are charging so much.
05:31:14.600 - 05:31:45.134, Speaker A: We need more competition. It's something that I talk about in my sessions. It's actually thanks to this change in tooling, it's actually really. Easy to get started. It's pretty darn simple to actually build a proof of concept decentralized app in 30 minutes to an hour. You can sit down in a session and really build a DAP. But building a very secure one and building one that can handle all the bad guys attacking it is a completely different game.
05:31:45.134 - 05:32:23.174, Speaker A: And being able to think adversarially is like, I didn't even understand this. I have like an engineering background and when I got into Ethereum, there's so much more to it, right there's economics. I've learned so many and even in the last six months, impermanent loss. I'm googling all day long. What are these things? What are these new tools? So there's a lot of neat things going on. I really wish audits were cheaper though. I don't know where I'm going exactly with this, but I wish we could figure out some way to have a much easier spot check auditing system for just everybody in the ecosystem.
05:32:23.174 - 05:33:27.486, Speaker A: And I don't know how that would work or scale or anything. I mean, to talk about the open source side there a little bit, there are a few partners out there or people building things that are more I won't say they're like static testing. So when I mentioned static testing, saying, hey, there's a fingerprint of something here and we check to see if your code is doing something like that and then we tell you if you're doing something bad versus something that's more like a learning type platform where it's much more dynamic about how it's looking at your contracts. Fuzz testing, if you understand what Fuzz testing is, of trying a bunch of different parameters that go into your program to see if the predictable outcome comes out or if something else comes. So like I know Microsoft Research has built, they actually have a plugin that they've been talking to me about like, hey, should we put that out as part of Vs code or integrate it with some of your stuff that allows people to do like Fuz testing and things like that on their smart contracts. I know like Trailbits and a few other guys out there have been doing similar things, right? They have really cool tools for that. I will say that some of them are free, right.
05:33:27.486 - 05:34:10.986, Speaker A: You can just use them, but there's a lot of sharp edges there and that's not a negative thing. I just mean you really kind of have to understand how those tools work. So I think there's definitely an opportunity there for us to make that a little more smoother, like onboarding process for people to use them. But definitely something you're right and then when you do get to the point where you're going to have a billion dollars in your application, then it probably makes sense to go pay those guys for the big audit. Yeah, for sure. On top of the open Zeppelin contracts that have been audited, on top of Bidler and hard hat and these great tools. Now there's all of these other components in the ecosystem that are just becoming more and more mature.
05:34:10.986 - 05:35:01.998, Speaker A: And we have these new building blocks and each of these building blocks themselves are audited in some form, whether it's now there's 40 million total value locked, so it must be audited in some way or you get a formal audit. But one thing just during the hackathon and seeing the tools that everybody is using, it's crazy to see the jumps and we say it every hackathon, the jump from the last hackathon because of this composability, because of open source, because of just the nature of how the ecosystem works. It's so exciting to see each new piece just come into the world and let us be able to use it again. Open conversation. Don't know exactly where I'm going, but I just love the composability of the space and open source. Really kind of nudges that along a lot. Yeah.
05:35:01.998 - 05:36:05.346, Speaker A: And some of the components we've talked about before, we'll call them Lego blocks, right, of not just the smart contract, but the client application. When you're using web3, JS or Ethers or something like that, having these composable pieces, kind of like if people came from the web3 component world or the web component world of web two, having these little components that allow you to easily kind of plug that in. I think Austin's done great work there as well. I want to keep building on that ecosystem, keep building more of those reusable components that people can use. So not only can they go fast at the hackathon, but if we get a lot of people using those things, then again, they become hardened. They become something that you can really rely on to build production scale app. One of my theories for open things that needs to be worked on, what I'm doing in the scaffold Ethereum is it seems like when I build a decentralized app now with all the tools ready to go, I end up spending way too much time centering DIVS and getting the product to look right.
05:36:05.346 - 05:36:47.354, Speaker A: And I feel like that's still somewhere where we could do better. That's not exactly ethereum. The Ethereum stuff is coming in there, but being able to handle I put out like an Allow list the other day where it's just like here is an Allow list that is connected to another contract. You can add and remove addresses to the Allow. Super simple primitive, right? But it's something that's like you don't have it packaged up with the UI. You don't have those things packaged up with the UI. So I keep trying to what can I build that's kind of missing tooling wise, but also provide the UI on top of it and just give you out of the box a bunch of components that a good example that we don't have yet that we need is just like an exchange.
05:36:47.354 - 05:37:29.006, Speaker A: You need to be able, know, deploy two tokens and set up an exchange and just plop that little component right into your react and just have the exchange. Right. And I'll bet you in three months that's available if it's not already. I know you could just fork uniswap and get it going. But I'm talking about meant to be built like rapid application development. Like can I just grab an exchange out of the block? Can I just grab a bridge? Can I grab some kind of like lending mechanism and just throw that in there? So I'm as excited as I am about the composability and the new stuff is it's like if we see these big jumps from hackathon to hackathon, I can't wait for the next hackathon, right? 2021. What's the next big hackathon? I'm ready for it.
05:37:29.006 - 05:38:16.334, Speaker A: I want to see what kind of tools and other composability Lego blocks get built there too. Yeah. The other thing that is something that maybe not on the surface seems like a big deal between public and private has been gas. So anybody working in the public space obviously understands what gas is because they're probably paying a lot for it sometimes. So what that means is from a developer perspective is though we want to make the most smallest amount of code or smallest amount of execution that we need to do there to keep our transactions as small as possible, pay the least amount of gas, those kind of things. So optimizing for that beyond just like security implications. But on the private side for a while it's been like, hey, we can spit up these private chains, we'll basically negate gas it's there but we're not really doing anything with it.
05:38:16.334 - 05:39:05.580, Speaker A: And it's a little bit of like, hey, I don't know. That's going to lead us to a great place because ultimately the EVM in the current Ethereum does have limitations around how much we can execute in one transaction that we're going to do. And I've seen enterprises build code that's ridiculously big and they're like, oh yeah, we have to jack this up because we can't execute it. I'm like there's going to be some downstream effects of you having something that heavy running every time you do this thing and also this future world that's not going to be feasible. So maybe we should look at your code there and see if we could break that up or do something more simple or things like that. So I feel like that's an area too where enterprises are learning, hey, maybe we should think about things a little bit more like the public guys do, at least from a gas perspective. The mental model there is good.
05:39:05.580 - 05:39:47.590, Speaker A: When I was building my games, I didn't want to think about gas at all. Like you're saying I was in my private world. I wanted to make the game a really fun experience and I wanted to build it on Ethereum and use Ethereum cool things. But when it came to deploy it to Ethereum, there was no way that game was going to operate on public main net. And I found XDI eventually a side chain that was cheaper and it was like, less security, whatever. But I was able to deploy my fun games over here and it made a lot more sense. But I still Bridging like, you're talking about bridging this idea of building it exactly the way you wanted it to versus building it the way that it works better on a gas intensive network.
05:39:47.590 - 05:40:50.814, Speaker A: One example would be like the proxy pattern, where when I go to Etherscan and I go to inspect some smart Contracts code, I don't want to land and go look and find out it's a proxy. I want to get in there and see what the guts of the thing are. But that's the way it works for Gas, right? You deploy the logic once and then you redeploy little versions that are proxies, but if someone wants to get in and inspect that, they're going to find the proxy, not the contract. And so it's kind of like you add these small layers of abstraction along the way for Gas purposes to make the deployment cheaper, but then for the Noob that comes along that wants to learn more, you've just made it a little bit harder for them to kind of get that exposure and get into that too. So it's a double edged sword for sure. Yeah, I think it's the same. This is not a new problem, right? So it's funny you mentioned games, but building video games when you're doing stuff like that, sometimes in some critical code section, you'll basically write some assembly code to do it because you're running on an Xbox or you're running on a PS Four or something like that.
05:40:50.814 - 05:41:21.046, Speaker A: And you only have limited amount of resources there, right? So you'll do that, but then when you do that, it's hard for people to read or like, what is this? Why we have this thing? We have this nice object oriented programming and now we're over here in C world. Like, what happened? Or assembly. I feel like that's the same thing. So I don't think there's like a magic bullet there. I feel like, build what you want, right? Let's build it right now. But we should keep these kind of things in mind of like, hey, be aware. Like, if we're going to move over to public main net, let's not make such gargantuan code over there.
05:41:21.046 - 05:41:45.434, Speaker A: Let's kind of break it up a little bit. So there's a balance for sure. You hinted at it earlier you stop thinking about deploying it into the perfect world. You're not going to have your little private blockchain. Like you need to be thinking about main net Ethereum and thinking about how you even back to that using some other l Two solution or something else. The mental model definitely. I think it is shifting.
05:41:45.434 - 05:42:27.338, Speaker A: Hearing these Enterprise guys, like I said earlier with that, it's so much fun to hear the big guys say that they're going to start backing to Ethereum and less private chains, where you get to control the rules, and then when you want to change something, you're like, well, we just need to make the rules a little bit different over here. Like you said, that's not going to work. So it's cool to see things moving toward the main net, but also the main net also filled up earlier. Right. We had gas prices get crazy with DeFi, which maybe kind of could be we could be plugging for developers. We're seeing a lot of great adoption on Ethereum. Right.
05:42:27.338 - 05:43:06.102, Speaker A: This is a cool problem to have because we're seeing so many new users come in and they're financially incentivized in some way and they want to play around and they want to use new tools and use new products. So there's a huge opportunity for great developers to get on the platform and build something cool. Yeah, for sure. And I think, as you said, the goal here for us is, at least from me, my background. Like what I'm working on is I want to make that as easy as possible for the novices not getting away of the advanced guys. And so working with different guys. We've worked with the Truffle guys for a long time, still do open Zeppelin.
05:43:06.102 - 05:43:29.938, Speaker A: We're very close with them. The Biddler guys have come along. Just a bunch of different people building hardware stuff or platforms like infuria you mentioned Alchemy's got some stuff out there too. It's been really cool to see again, I see them all as like big Lego blocks. It's like, okay, I need to do something on public. I can just plug infuria in here really quickly and I'm off to the races. Like, I can start doing that thing.
05:43:29.938 - 05:44:02.362, Speaker A: That's amazing because you talk about years ago when you had to stand up your own node, it was like, oh my God, stone Age. Yeah. To participate in the network, you would download something and then wait hours, if not days, for it to be synced up just so you could talk, so you could start participating. Yeah, for sure. That's good. But on the enterprise side, again, not to plug Baseline, but that's been a great group of guys. For those who don't know, baseline is a project that's basically bringing that world.
05:44:02.362 - 05:44:54.186, Speaker A: I think Paul Brody was on here talking probably earlier about it, and there might be others, but it's bringing the enterprise and the public together to say, hey, how are we going to bridge that world? How are we going to make it work? For one of the big things I've been kind of driving over there and working on is identities. Right? We have identity systems that exist today in the web. Two world, like Azure ad and a bunch of other things like OAuth and things like that. But what happens in this future world? Because we still do, even if you're building a private network. So let's say we're building a private consortium, which is like a group of people who are going to do B to B type scenarios together, business to business, then how do we introduce them? How do we make sure that we can connect them in the network? And we've done a lot of work around there, like tried a bunch of different things. Some of them failed, some of them good. As we did that, it was like we should be thinking about this from the public side.
05:44:54.186 - 05:45:48.960, Speaker A: So whenever we're out here in the public main net, how do we discover people? How do we have an electronic introduction? There something that's reliable too. And we can stand behind not just saying, oh, it's a hacker. How do we guard against things like phishing attacks and things that happen when you start using things like decentralized IDs. So for those who are interested, definitely there's so many technical working groups that have spun up over there and we're hard at work on that stuff, so feel free to join. There's so much you can learn from a lot of my mentor sessions when we're trying to get the mental model of what the heck the EVM is and what's going on, learning from attacks, like being able to talk about Reentrance, you almost have to talk about Reentrance to talk about the atomicity of a contract of execution. And that leads to flash loans and other things too. But the attacks, I think, are just so educational in a lot of ways.
05:45:48.960 - 05:46:19.206, Speaker A: Have you ever played like, Ethernot or any of the games that show you the attacks? Have you gone through any of those? I haven't used those. I did the was it crypto? Zombies. Cryptozombies is another one, right? Yeah. Both of these are on Ethereum.org developers getting started. I mean, there's a ton of resources there, but they kind of take you through in a very gamified way, like writing solidity, getting your storage set up, getting your functions going. But then I would plug on top of that.
05:46:19.206 - 05:46:50.414, Speaker A: The Ethernot series is really good. I remember I was working my day job and I had just gotten home. I was kind of like the man. And I sat down, I started playing the Ethernot and I got to the Reentrance and I knew what Reentrance sort of was, but I'd never gotten my head around it. And I remember the moment in the console log when I drained the contract and you get a big congratulations. That feeling, it was so great. It was better than any paycheck.
05:46:50.414 - 05:47:30.430, Speaker A: And I feel like that's one of the things that really got me into Ethereum more was that excitement and that drive that comes from just although you are attacking a contract, you are kind of being a bad guy. You're learning kind of how the EVM works at a lower level and you're learning kind of some of the gotchas and how it all works. And I think that it's a fun way to learn. Let me see if I can pull up any other resources for good tutorials to get through. I like the idea of the crypto zombies and I guess there's a lot right on the website too, but I'm going to try to find some other ones. Ethernet. Oh, viper fun was the other one if you're a python person, not JavaScript.
05:47:30.430 - 05:47:49.650, Speaker A: Or I guess viper versus solidity. Right. There's kind of both sides of all of these things that you'll find. And again, just Ethereum.org developers is a great resource to land on. And of course ETH build and Scaffold ETH. Yeah, these are awesome.
05:47:49.650 - 05:48:11.510, Speaker A: Yes, I'm just seeing those ones. Those are the ones that are on here. It was the Viper and Ethernotes and crypto zombies. You should go play all of those if you're a new developer getting into it. What else? Maybe like things that Ethereum is particularly good at versus things that Ethereum is particularly bad at. Right. Like storage is going to be very expensive.
05:48:11.510 - 05:49:05.738, Speaker A: You've got 15 2nd block times in terms of not reinventing another web two thing. What things have we seen in web3 that were very unique to web3 that kind of help a developer get a mental model for what they could be building? Yeah, from a composability standpoint to pick on storage for a second, I mean, the first time I saw IPFS years ago, I was like, well, this is interesting. So basically I can just throw some data out here and I can have this thing essentially replicate on this P to P network. That's pretty freaking awesome. So that was a building block we used quite a bit. When you think about the web two world of clouds and things like that that have storage, they're all great, but they always have these entry points, like these single entry points. It can be attacked, manipulated, throttled, all kinds of things and you end up with the results of stuff that happened with that.
05:49:05.738 - 05:49:47.974, Speaker A: But thinking about things a little differently around and I think what's really cool is the clouds in some ways have changed. Right. Because we have gateways and things right now to get into IPFS from traditional clouds, which is pretty cool. So I feel like from that perspective, the storage thing was pretty interesting for a decentralized a new way to kind of think about how that works. Definitely in our sessions we deploy to a live network and I talk about not even we can stop this thing now, this thing that we've created. There's nothing we can it's out there for good now and there's no stopping it. And it's an interesting mental model to get over for a developer.
05:49:47.974 - 05:50:33.126, Speaker A: Like, oh wow. It's not like when you think of I've got my database and I stand up my database and a bunch of people go talk to it and it falls down and I stand up another one and someone attacks it. You stand up a smart contract and it's there, buddy, it's there for good. Yeah, that's super cool. I think something that people kind of fall into a trap a little bit is again, it's hard to kind of like especially when you first start with Web Three, think about it in a different way than you did Web Two and you start to fall back on things that you did in Web Two. So I just say people keep an open mind. I'm always looking around for different components that can help me more Web Three if I what I'm doing, or more decentralized in that way.
05:50:33.126 - 05:51:17.494, Speaker A: But there's certainly things like on the enterprise side where there might be some things that are semi centralized or something like that. And I don't think that's end of the world at least, right? I think, I think we need some time there to kind of adapt some of those systems to come over and we're seeing a lot of I think ENS's work has been super cool. Sorry, might have been me. Might have been me. No, go ahead. I think I cut in there, sorry. No, I was just saying I think ENS has been one of those bridges too, right? Where if we think about traditional DNS and naming systems and then looking at how ENS has changed, certainly big enterprises are like looking at that now to say, hey, we need to be part of that.
05:51:17.494 - 05:51:57.940, Speaker A: How can we be a part of that from a registers perspective, things like that. So that's been awesome as well. Awesome? I don't know. Let me think of let's see what else I'm trying to think of other gotchas that we I mean, like numbers and JavaScript, but that's not when you're tracking numbers as a gotcha. As a new developer, you know that these numbers are going to be so big that you're going to have to use some library to track your numbers. And you don't basically display it as a float until it gets right to the user. Those are kind of gotchas that we have along the way that aren't probably as interesting.
05:51:57.940 - 05:52:51.458, Speaker A: The off chain stuff that you're talking about is really cool about how you just need a signature sometimes. A lot of these you don't have to do everything on chain. Some things can just be signature based and you can pull these voting mechanisms now that it cost one dollars per vote on chain. Let's pull these voting mechanisms off. Let's have everybody just sign things using their keys and then have one transaction that puts those signatures on chain. There's a lot of technology around that and it warms my heart to see the user experience along with the developer experience, getting better and better and someone can just come in and sign a thing and just participate, which is really exciting for me. Yeah, I think that's really powerful and it kind of ties into a little bit like DIDs and things like that, having these on chain anchored things that we can prove and always point back to.
05:52:51.458 - 05:53:19.630, Speaker A: But then we have some of the assets even like living off chain super cool, right? And it makes a lot of sense right now. Maybe it'll evolve somewhere from there. But I think for now, I think it's a super cool solution. It helps scalability quite a bit. As you mentioned, people building apps and things like that. I'm trying to think I mean, the other one that I think has evolved quite a bit, that was kind of a gotcha that we used to run into a lot and it's not as much anymore. Thanks to folks like MetaMask and such, has been wallets.
05:53:19.630 - 05:54:09.566, Speaker A: We talk about understanding what key pairs are and how to sign a transaction and things like that. But then when you start talking about hierarchical wallets and things like that, people are like, whoa, what is this thing? An account versus a wallet? Yes, exactly. And there's been like a drive and I'm interested to see where this goes. But on the public side, at least for a while, driven from Mainnet has always been kind of, hey, we'll have a wallet concept and then we'll basically have your app that's doing something. Right. So a lot of times they would be separate, right? And you would say, well, we could have many apps use this wallet and in theory that sounds good, right? But in practice it's a little bit like I think especially from the enterprise side, they're like, what the heck is this? And they feel like they're being attacked or something. They're like, what is this other thing I have to download? Why do I need that thing? It should just be part of my app.
05:54:09.566 - 05:54:52.474, Speaker A: So seeing some of the evolution of even what MetaMask is doing now, where you can kind of blend those through together, make your app just be part of it, that's awesome. I think that's going to make it the on ramp for people using it. Not just developers, but people who use the app. They don't have to download a bunch of different components, they just have this one thing. Yeah, I think it's kind of a TLDR of our talk today is like tools are getting better, products are getting better, everything is sort of becoming more and more composable. Every hackathon that is put on, we see new building blocks come out, we see new paradigms invented, we see new attacks. So I'm just very excited about all this.
05:54:52.474 - 05:55:21.560, Speaker A: And big thanks to the ETH online team for having us and letting us rap about doing what we love to do best. Sure. I don't know if there's any questions or anything, we got a few minutes here, but if there's any questions. So thank you so much for that amazing conversation. I was going to say some of the same things, austin, you were going to talk about, but you kind of front run me on that one. Analogies. There you go.
05:55:21.560 - 05:56:28.906, Speaker A: No, this is exactly sort of our way to measure progress, the ease of initial setup being minimized every time we do an event or anytime somebody has to get started. And that being as small and frictionless as possible is sort of the indicator from our side that the developer ecosystem is growing and it's actually ready to be even bigger. So we don't have a lot of time for questions. We are going to take a quick break before our next talk, but I do want to kind of point out that anybody who's listening to this thing, and also to Austin and Kale, york did a great job at kind of supplementing a lot of resources on the chat with a lot of links that are super useful. So we do have a lot of sort of additional context into people being able to try and play with some of these tools and that's been an amazing addition to this amazing annotation to this conversation. So I want to kind of thank both of you for giving us your Friday afternoon and thanks again for this conversation and we hope to kind of see you help out a lot more developers for the next ETH Global event. Thanks, everyone.
05:56:28.906 - 05:56:39.406, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you, Kartik. Thanks to the ETH Global team. Thanks for York creeping in the chat with giving us links. So thank you, everybody. Thank you for this. Let's build some more stuff.
05:56:39.406 - 06:00:56.528, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks again. And we're going to take a quick two minute break before our next talk and we'll enjoy the radio in the meantime. All right, I hope you've enjoyed a quick two minute break in the process and this is just the right time for us to get ready for our next talk. So I'm super excited for this talk. We are going to be bringing on three amazing people in this space. We have Cecilia, Christina and Chewie, and they're going to be talking about how UNICEF Innovate has been able to sort of manage and help increase the impact of the ethereum ecosystem throughout their efforts and kind of how they've seen ethereum being used by startups all around the world. So we have the team here on the call and I'd like to welcome all of them here and kick us off with their chat.
06:00:56.528 - 06:00:58.790, Speaker A: So please welcome Christina and team.
06:01:03.640 - 06:01:15.512, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for having us today. I'm just going to start sharing my screen and can someone confirm they can see it? We can see it.
06:01:15.646 - 06:01:16.088, Speaker A: Perfect.
06:01:16.174 - 06:02:06.792, Speaker B: Over to you, Cece. Hi, everyone. So my name is Cecilia, and together with Christina and Chui, we will today talk about systems that have been reimagined with blockchain, or more specifically, about how. Can blockchain help us reimagine systems for the future we want to live in. And I think it's just a good timing to have these discussions in the context of the many big challenges that we're facing today, starting with displacement. So, just for you to know, there are today 80 million people around the world that have been forced out of their homes. This is people that may not be able to go to school, may not be able to see or be with their extended families or even their immediate families and may not even have, of course, food as a given.
06:02:06.792 - 06:03:54.300, Speaker B: 40% of these people are children. And questions that we have are how do we secure safe and healthy a safe and healthy environment for the displaced children? And how can we enable medical records for them to be transferable across borders? Or what kind of education credentials can be universally accepted? Another challenge is about the training for tomorrow. So did you know that actually 65% of the children entering primary schools today will ultimately work in new job types and functions that today do not exist? This is just crazy in terms of how slowly is the education system picking up on many of the leads of what's the future of education? So how can we do this? How can we design appropriate curriculums to give children a chance to have opportunities in the future? And of course, emergencies. We are today living in an unreal situation. COVID-19 happened and it was a catastrophe globally in different industries like healthcare, for education, for the delivery of food, so amongst many, many sectors and put the world in some sort of test. So not only we need the processes and mechanisms to now react into what is left out of COVID but also how can we respond to these emergencies that will keep coming to the world? So UNICEF. But UNICEF Innovation.
06:03:54.300 - 06:04:58.940, Speaker B: A lot of you here probably know what we do at UNICEF. And you know that we are an agency within the United Nations that works towards the care and the development of the children in the places with the highest needs. Probably not. A lot of you know that there's a team within UNICEF called UNICEF Innovation that works on doing things new and differently to add value towards our mission. So what do we do specifically? So, number one, we identify emerging frontier technologies and we try to collaborate with private sector tools to find shared value towards our mission. We also invest in early stage startups to learn with them and work together to explore how can we provide more impact towards the growth of children. And third, we internally work on prototypes using these emerging technologies to see how can we further our objectives and UNICEF.
06:04:58.940 - 06:06:00.436, Speaker B: So I'll start by talking about the first part of the investment component and Christina later will talk more about how and what kind of prototypes we're working on internally. And last, today chui will speak about one of the use cases of the work that we've been doing together with his startup, starting with the Frontier tech areas. So we're going to talk a lot about this over the discussion today, but just for you to know. So UNICEF Innovation, we work with emerging technologies. So what we define as technologies that lie in 100 billion dollar markets and also support more than a billion people's needs. So basically we work in the technologies that intersect these two worlds. But basically what that means is technologies that lie in financially sustainable markets and have the potential to influence and positively impact a lot of people.
06:06:00.436 - 06:07:35.616, Speaker B: And we invest and work with many of the technologies that you see there on the screen like machine learning, data science, virtual and augmented reality. But surely today we're also going to talk and dig in more a little bit about what we do around Blockchain, which is one of the key technologies we focus on. So the UNICEF Innovation Fund or the UNICEF Venture Fund, we call it both ways, but the Venture Fund is basically a 30 million pooled funding vehicle that we use within the UN to invest in early stage open source technologies that have the potential to positively impact the lives of children. This was the first venture capital vehicle within the United Nations that was funded four years ago and since then a lot has happened. So the purpose of what we do within the fund is try to engage and collaborate with early stage startups. So the kinds of startups that have a prototype of technology that they have a vision that they can use to positively impact the world. And what we do is we provide little sums of money that go up to $100,000 to these startups in developing emerging countries so that they can further test iterate their products and eventually scale as digital public goods what kind of projects are part of our portfolio.
06:07:35.616 - 06:09:05.804, Speaker B: So the kinds of projects that are registered as private companies and this is purely because we want to support private sector entities. So the kinds of entities that will build a financially sustainable business model and eventually can stand up without the kind of support that comes from the UN. We only purely invest in open source technology solutions that have an existing prototype and there's a link for which they can make an argument that their solution that they're building is making a positive impact globally. So the kinds of solutions we invest in and how do we assess them really is we really look for solutions that have identified a very, very strong problem and have developed a solution towards it. I think what we see a lot in the hundreds and now actually thousands of applications around Blockchain is that we see that many times we get applications that say they want to use blockchain for something that is not particularly needed. So this is one thing that we address? Can blockchain in fact be used for that specific problem? Is that the best technology that they can use and does it go accordingly to what they want to address? We very much explore the team. We invest in local teams, building local solutions for local problems that have a global impact.
06:09:05.804 - 06:10:21.848, Speaker B: So building a company is more than the idea. A lot goes into the execution of that idea and having the context, knowledge, understanding what are the players that are part of that ecosystem is a key component for succeeding in that solution. So if you're interested in this kind of engagement with us, just be sure that you have all these components in place together with the technical viability and the business model that you envisioned will help get your solution as a financially sustainable company. A little bit about the portfolio experience. So after we decide to invest in the companies, the company is going to our what we call the portfolio of the units of Venture Fund. And this portfolio is particularly active in the first year of the investment. In this first year of the investment is that we work a lot on advising on how to strengthen the product development, on what kind of strategic support do the companies need to strengthen their business model.
06:10:21.848 - 06:11:55.764, Speaker B: So many times what we see is that they need to strengthen, for example, their user experience. How can basically a user go into the platform but also return, which is a problem with many startup. Also, you know, what are the programmatic expertise that we can support from UNICEF like Wash, Health, Disabilities or Education to help these solutions grow and the minimum viable product to be solidified for further funding? One key thing to mention is that the investments after the year of the investment period don't just leave or stop engaging with us. We continue our support even further and especially after the year of the investment period when we see that the products have been solidified. We work a lot with external partners and are positioning within the United Nations to foster these collaborations and facilitate the kind of engagements that will help the companies grow even further. All of this to say that today we have made more than 100 investments in more than 50 countries. And just to give you a sense of one of the blockchain solutions that we've invested in so their name is Stadwig, they're based in India and they use a platform that is enabled through Blockchain and IoT to track the delivery of food and vaccines to the people that need it.
06:11:55.764 - 06:13:13.836, Speaker B: And what's key about this solution know, especially today, in times of COVID they are now working with the government of India on a prototype to track the delivery of food to low income areas where the supply chain is compromised. And understanding if the food is in fact delivered and is delivered in good shape is key. I'm going to stop on the examples right here, just because later, after, Christina also gives a little bit more about the context and the kind of internal prototypes we do around blockchain. Inside UNICEF, we'll have Chui, who is one of our portfolio companies, talk a little bit more about the kind of engagement that we've had together and the kind of solution he's been working on and the kind of support we've been giving him. But before I finish, I wanted to also talk about this other part. So after the one year of the investment period, so after that one year portfolio experience that the companies have with us, we work on scaling these digital public goods. And what that means in particular is after the companies have been solidifying their product on their own, how can we facilitate and foster engagements between the solutions, between the startups and their countries? Through our UNICEF country offices.
06:13:13.836 - 06:14:54.284, Speaker B: So we have a presence with UNICEF field offices in more than 150 countries, and that's a very vast geographic expansion to not only help them work, especially with public sector organizations, but also for them to expand into new countries. So 25% of our portfolio has been engaging with this network of global offices that allows this solidifying their presence in the market. Follow on funding. As I said before, this is something we put a lot of emphasis in. So after our engagement period, after the work we do together with the startups, how do we foster new relationships with funders from other venture funds or other similar funding vehicles that would be interested in the solutions that lie within our portfolio, that are vetted and are doing amazing humanitarian work? And one last thing I wanted to very much highlight is the building up of two financial vehicles that have been the recent ones within the UN system and within UniSAs. So one is the growth fund. So the Growth Fund is basically the pool funding vehicle also that we have set up to provide larger funding size amounts to the startups that graduate from our portfolio, but also startups that are working in the market and are also ready for the kind of scale up funding opportunities.
06:14:54.284 - 06:15:44.210, Speaker B: So these funding possibilities go from $200 to $400,000. And then we have the crypto fund. So the Crypto Fund has been the latest, latest innovation that we've done inside of the UN regarding the funding possibilities for startups. And we set it up a year ago in 2019, October 2019. And it basically follows the same rules as I was telling you about, about the Venture Fund, except that it provides investment in crypto denominated assets. So so far we've done twelve investments. Jesus also at the end will also talk a little bit about this as he has also received investment from the Crypto Fund.
06:15:44.210 - 06:17:22.868, Speaker B: But there are eight other countries that are also involved and have recipients of this kind of funding. And it's been a remarkable experience for us in terms of tracking the kind of investment that we provided to the startups tracking the kind of investments that the startups are doing internally to deploy this funding and make a better use of it and the kind of efficiencies that we've done internally in the investment process to secure faster and more efficient funding to the beneficiaries that we want to serve with that and that snapshot of what we do. Christina, the floor is all yours to talk about the internal prototypes that we do with blockchain and crypto, awesome, and thanks so much. I think one of the important things that you mentioned was the Crypto Fund, particularly at the end, and that's really UNICEF redesigning our own systems to essentially adapt to this new world. So I'm going to build a little bit on the Crypto Fund and then talk about particularly Ethereum prototypes that we have been building over the last couple of years within our team. But people are always curious about where does blockchain and crypto play a role as it pertains to UNICEF? And Cecilia, you give great examples about early stage investments that we're making, but why are we making these investments and what are we looking for as we do this? So, from a UNICEF perspective, there's really three big buckets that I don't think these come as a surprise to anyone in the blockchain space that we're looking to leverage new innovative financing models. So this is things like the Crypto Fund looking to increase efficiency and transparency in internal processes.
06:17:22.868 - 06:17:56.612, Speaker B: So really challenging ourselves to reimagine internal processes as well and see if we can leverage blockchain in that case. And then how do we incentivize the creation of open source digital public goods? And we've done a few pilots on that. Our work, particularly within our blockchain team, focuses around three buckets. The first you've already heard about is the Innovation Fund and the Crypto Fund. The second is really around internal prototypes. And UNICEF works in over 190 different countries. And so there's countries who are interested in using blockchain, and our team would support those countries in those explorations.
06:17:56.612 - 06:18:44.356, Speaker B: And I'm going to give you some examples. And lastly, learning I heard the talk just before us about how to get started in the space. I think that's still a big challenge for a lot of the folks that we interact with, too, of how do we reduce the barrier to access to not just crypto, but also more generally, blockchain applications that can be beneficial. So we do a lot on that side, getting UN folks together and doing prototypes together, or learning sessions together as well. We have been looking at blockchain since actually since 2015, five years at least. Now, Cecilia mentioned that the Crypto Fund was launched last year. For those of you that would have been at DevCon, that's where we made the announcement.
06:18:44.356 - 06:19:55.084, Speaker B: And we're super happy to be with the Ethereum community there and launch that with the ethereum foundation. But I have to mention all of the milestones that actually went into actually launching the crypto funds. And it was a long journey of two years to get to the point where UNICEF could reimagine how it worked with digital assets and actually be able to accept crypto. And so some of the highlights would be, for example, UNICEF France in early 2018 actually allowed mining using your gaming console, and anything that was mined went towards UNICEF and that supported the Syrian refugee Cris at that point. Now funds that are committed to the crypto fund go to supporting early stage startups that are working on these variety of solutions, particularly related to the crypto fund. I thought it would be interesting to highlight two internal products that we've been building. So being the first UN entity to use crypto as crypto, there was a gap for us, particularly for public sector tools specifically to help us in how we tell our story, in how we're using blockchain and crypto and how we internally support our processes.
06:19:55.084 - 06:20:47.330, Speaker B: So our team has been working on Juniper, which is a tool set to really enable public sector organizations. The first is a visualization tool, which is kind of like a simplified block explorer is probably the best way to put it, and you're more than welcome to go check it out. But the whole idea is for us to be as transparent as possible in terms of how many funds we have, how much funds we've disbursed, who's received those disbursements. And the next version of the visualization tool will even go a level deeper and we'll show you. For example, Chewy, who's going to talk, has received some crypto. What did he decide to spend it on? So he'll label it as he spent it on salaries, or he spent it on bounties or whatever he decided to do with that crypto. And so we're making the process all the way from donation through to use of the crypto by the investment companies as transparent as possible.
06:20:47.330 - 06:21:36.508, Speaker B: And secondly, a portfolio tool. This is like a really customized block explorer with also a valuation tool. And I'll give you a sense of what that looks like. So the crypto fund website itself, three categories you have how are the funds coming in, what are the investments that we're making. And then if you really want to dive into the actual block confirmations or transaction confirmations, you can actually click on the track section and you can see all of that fun stuff going on, particularly in the investment section. Though, if you want to learn about projects that we've supported, and Cecilia pointed to a few of those, you can go into the invest section and you'll see we've tried to use some plain language as much as possible, describe what the project's doing, give you a quick snapshot, and then you can click on it. And that's where you'll actually see the verification of those transfers.
06:21:36.508 - 06:22:20.220, Speaker B: That have taken place. Our transfers to date have been in the amount of either our very first was in Ten Ether, so wanted to just make sure that the Piping was working. And then our most recent transfers were in the amount of 125 E. So slowly but surely building up our own muscle memory in terms of how we deal with digital assets. And then the portfolio tool that I mentioned, and essentially being a customized block explorer, this is for us to be able to keep track of how much transaction fees have we paid for overall disbursement. So, in the last year, those twelve investments that Cecilia mentioned were about half a million dollars worth. So less than 2% in transaction fees that we've paid.
06:22:20.220 - 06:23:14.988, Speaker B: Even though it's been a crazy year for transaction fees, it's still for us been fairly manageable. And then the valuation part, which I don't have a screenshot of right now, but we have an algorithm, essentially, that we use across multiple exchanges to take an average, and we're able to track that all within this portal to make it really easy for our accounting team and the rest of our colleagues at UNICEF. So that's one of the internal projects that we've been working on. But the second one that I wanted to highlight to you, I think is particularly relevant in the context of COVID And this is a project that we were working on even before COVID hit. And this is around bringing universal connectivities to schools and school communities. Having access to information, sorry, to the Internet gives us access to information. It provides us additional opportunities.
06:23:14.988 - 06:24:17.984, Speaker B: So we have access to microwork, or we have access to online learning, access to health information. And if you don't have access to the Internet, then you're blocked from all of these opportunities. And so we have been working on a variety of solutions to help bring universal connectivities to school and school communities. But particularly we've been looking at how blockchain can play a role in that. So there is a product called Project Connect that our team has been working on for several years that actually helps map the schools in each country. And in this case, you can see Colombia here and the Internet connectivity speed of every single school. The reason that it's important and helpful for us to know the Internet connectivity speed is we can then look at this map and see how do we teach in certain regions, can we provide online education or not? Or if it has good connectivity speed, we know that those communities might have the most recent information about COVID for example, and maybe other communities that aren't as connected.
06:24:17.984 - 06:25:16.564, Speaker B: We need to focus on getting information out in a variety of different ways in those communities. So that was step one. No blockchain in that piece at all. But what we have been working on now is getting real time connectivity information and writing that on chain. So the old way that each of these schools would report their connectivity speed is that a principal every month would fill out a form and they would mail that into us. There's obviously a couple inefficiencies in that process and we also want to make sure we're getting the most accurate information and that the information actually matches what the schools are paying for particularly and then starting to look at. Okay, so if we know the rules of engagement with an Internet service provider, can we actually use smart contracts to manage some of that relationship rather than having a lot of hands on and manual intervention? So the first step of this process was really understanding where the schools are.
06:25:16.564 - 06:26:20.412, Speaker B: Like I mentioned, no blockchain part in that element. Right away though, we are looking now at using Bounties to essentially help people crowdsource locations of schools. So that would be one element. But what we have done is we're using various methods to collect real time internet speed. So for example, either through a probe in the school or through Chrome extensions, there's a variety of different methods we're using in different countries to get this real time connectivity speed and to have a marker that we're able to say that this information hasn't been tampered with by any party. And so to have that on chain, to be able to have that once we've done that, then we're starting to think through what the smart contract structure would look like. We have even had early conversations in terms of if we look at a school as an economic hub, for example, how could we leverage different DeFi protocols to actually enable that community in a variety of different ways.
06:26:20.412 - 06:27:47.620, Speaker B: Those are still pretty early ideas, but just to point out that those are conversations that our team are having to see how we can best leverage blockchain and specifically Ethereum in this case for these school communities. So with the whole intention of being going from a map that's mostly red to going to a map that's mostly green, so that then we have a community of people who have access to the Internet, but not just the Internet. But to be able to join, for example, the Ethereum community and have access to microwork or be able to join various projects, that's incredibly powerful. So the Giga Project in and of itself has four different pillars. And to date I've mentioned some of these prototypes that we've done, but we have four or five various prototypes that we have done that we're now looking to consolidate into one essentially larger platform, the Project Connect platform. So mapping the data and getting that in real time, using smart contracts to essentially monitor whether the internet speed is essentially in the band of what's supposed to be delivered. We're looking at various ways that we can capture internet service providers bidding on connectivity in countries and how we can do that in a fair and transparent way online and then a whole variety of things around empowering the community once they have connectivity.
06:27:47.620 - 06:28:32.420, Speaker B: So we've done things like once you have connectivity, looking at certificates on chain, which is, I think, a super easy example of helping someone build a digital CV, but also microwork and bounties and things like that. I think that's been a big part of our work as well. So with that, I'm going to leave you just with some links to our website in case you're interested. So unicefinnovationfund.org or cryptofund? UNICEF IO, but we thought it would be particularly interesting for you to hear from one of the companies who's actually received funding from us and is working in these countries that we've been talking about. So, Chui, thank you for joining us on a Friday evening and over to you for the rest of the presentation.
06:28:33.480 - 06:29:19.392, Speaker A: Thank you, Christina. Thank you Ceci, it's a pleasure. It's an honor to be here. So I'm going to share my screen, so just let me know. I guess you can see my presentation there, right? So does it say CryptoKitties? Is this the right one? No, it's government as a platform. This session is called Reimagining Systems and perhaps this is where we found our best alignment with UNICEF innovation with Tessie and Christina, because we were trying to reimagine the public sector and as it says, in an approach shifting towards efficiency and trust. Christina was referring about how important is being efficient, being trustworthy, being transparent.
06:29:19.392 - 06:30:19.000, Speaker A: And this is something that governments and I want to start this presentation with just this foot for thought. Do you trust in your government? Can you think about that question a little bit? When was the last time that you interacted with your government? How much money did they ask you to pay in taxes? What services that you're receiving from them? What else can you ask them to give or to do for you? How can we tap on that? Do you actually trust them? Well, don't feel bad either if you trust or not. There is a 50% population that trusts or distrust the government. But what is worst is that this is growing because nine out of every ten public servants, they say that they just don't have the tools to cope with the size of the cities, with the amount of problems that are emerging. They don't know how to do, they don't have the technologies, they don't have the tools, they don't have the proceeders. They are operating almost like 200 years ago. And this creates a bigger problem.
06:30:19.000 - 06:31:02.100, Speaker A: According to McKinsey, an average of 20% of annual budget of every government in the world goes missing. This sums up to 5 trillion in the state where I live in Ovulian, Mexico. This is a billion dollars every single year. What can you do with a billion dollars? What can you do with this money to improve your government or to or to build this trust that we are thinking or to reimagine the system. So this is a lot of money that goes missing, a lot of distrust, a lot of inefficiency, and a lot of people saying that they don't have the tools to do anything about it. So we thought we need to reimagine that. And ASESI was showing, UNICEF taught us how to jump in the middle of those technologies, top technologies and most pressing problems.
06:31:02.100 - 06:31:51.444, Speaker A: And this is a company that I've co founded, OECT, jumped into the middle of these pressing problems and is helping governments to create solutions using technologies such as blockchain. And we are doing it together with UNICEF or the Ethereum Foundation among other partners that you can see there to bridge a gap. And I myself, I have a background as a mechatronics engineer. So what am I doing working in government? I did a PhD in artificial intelligence. Why am I working with the public sector? Well, because I believe that I know this secret sauce that we technologies know as the Moore slot in technology. If you see the right of this slide, we assume that every year things cost less and do more. But when I saw what government is doing and how they operate, they assume that every year things will cost more and do less.
06:31:51.444 - 06:32:46.724, Speaker A: So how can we overlap those worlds in this industry known as Goptech and pour these technologies and leverage this financial support either in regular finance or in crypto? From UNICEF to build the better world, to reimagine governments. And this is from the infinite Machine book government. Every government goes inefficient once they cross a certain size threshold and every city is growing. So we need to know how can we provide these technologies to create an opportunity for governments to grow their services, to grow their opportunity to serve, to grow the capacity to deliver solutions as their cities is growing, as the cities and or the population is growing. And the best that we can think about this is to build government as platforms. Think about ethereum. Think about this phrase quote from Tim O'Reilly.
06:32:46.724 - 06:34:07.340, Speaker A: He said to Jeff Bezos once that a platform beats an application every single time. And this is what we are trying to build, an ecosystem of solutions that bets into less duplicated efforts, rapid adoptions and better services. Imagine governments as platforms tapping into two essential principles trust and efficiency. I'm going to tap into efficiency very fast because we see efficiency as artificial intelligence and this time we need to focus on blockchain. But I want to talk about this because actually we're using blockchain cryptocurrency from the crypto fund that the UNICEF gave us as not only as a financial support, but also as a batch of trust for the government of the city of Buenos Aires to believe in us and to collaborate with another startup to mine all those public reviews on Google Places and social media about the public spaces in Buenos. Aires and grab the sentiment and grab the best or most relevant tags for the government to understand how the citizens are reacting to the public policies and the public spaces. We are doing this with the city right now and we are tapping into image recognition for faster actioning, potholes damage, parks, public lightning and also situations.
06:34:07.340 - 06:34:45.832, Speaker A: This is in Spanish, but you can see there that the best guess is the street light turned off. We can detect situations now with these algorithms sponsored by UNICEF for the Crypto Fund and by the Theorem Foundation. We want to do with the artificial intelligence and with the efficient approach of platforms, actions faster. And that's it. That I'm going to talk about artificial intelligence. I want to focus on trust, because here is where blockchain came in. And also I need to step back a couple of years ago, 2018, when UNICEF first trusted in us with the Innovation Fund, we were part of the First Blockchain Cohort to build a platform to deliver digital certificates.
06:34:45.832 - 06:35:22.632, Speaker A: We wanted to make everyone blockchain savvy or not, to be able to tap into the foundational attributes of blockchain immutability, transparency, decentralization, to leverage the power of the blockchain, even if you don't even understand what blockchain means. We wanted that. We wanted a simple WordPress plugin where anyone can issue certificate. And we created that with the first Innovation fund. And now with the Crypto Fund we created self sovereign identity. And we are combining those worlds. As you can see in this video, we created a very simple self sovereign identity with a blockchain ID.
06:35:22.632 - 06:35:50.780, Speaker A: Using metmask where you can sign in your credentials, you demonstrate that you own a wallet, an Ethereum wallet, and we use this wallet as your document holder. And then you fill in any form. Imagine you are asking for a construction permit and you click there send. And then an administrator. This is an administrator logging in. It comes in regular day working at the government. It sees recent request for construction permits.
06:35:50.780 - 06:36:30.344, Speaker A: It sees my data there, already paid the permit, all certified or to certify on the blockchain. And then I click, okay, everything is well here. And then I issue the certificate. Public servant, they don't have an idea of what happened in the back end, but they created a QR. They create a license that looks like this, and then it's openly verifiable by anyone, tampering, expiration, revocation and authenticity. Construction permit COVID passes, reopening tourism, responsibly, you name it. It's a blockchain asset linked to a wallet that is seen as document holder or a self sovereign identity for governments to serve everything.
06:36:30.344 - 06:37:18.520, Speaker A: If we look at the image on the top left, we're thinking about birth certificates, handicap certificates, construction permits, commercial permits, your university diplomas, everything on your document holder, on your Ethereum wallet. And once you want to, for example, take a look at the right, at the right image. If you want to ask for a construction permit to build an extra room in your house. Um, you click on the permit and it says, hey, your government wants to access your birth blockchain certificate and your home ownership certificate. And you click accept. They got the information, you make the payment, or if it requires a payment, and they send you back another blockchain digital asset with your construction permit, with all the foundational attributes of the blockchain. Who knows about blockchain? The citizen, the public servant.
06:37:18.520 - 06:37:59.556, Speaker A: We know about blockchain and we know that this brings back trust. And we are building this with the Ethereum 2.3.1 Library in Python, writing everything openly verifiable with the block source open standard for anyone to be able to verify so that decentralization is happening at this best, and with MetaMask, so that anyone with any browser can access or can sign this information. These kind of certificates, we have done it in very different flavors. This is one example. We are tracing subsidies, delivery certificates of money given to artists in the municipality of Bayablanca. We are putting it on blockchain transparency, on energy pricings in the national government of Chile.
06:37:59.556 - 06:38:59.708, Speaker A: We are doing that tamper proof records on energy pricings, university diplomas. This is on the Federal Argentinian blockchain, which is also based on Ethereum, deposited in the same wallet that you use to interact with your presidency or with your local government skills at different schools on the blockchain. Origin of wine derivatives and artisans products, for example. Also honey products from very vulnerable communities in the north of Argentina and the south of Mexico. Commitments to sustainability or sustainable actions with the Sustainability Development Center in Spain, commercial licenses in Costa Rica, in the municipality of Capos and Grecia, all as a digital asset linked to a self sovereign identity of a person. Winners of public lotteries. We are creating a model around blockchain on how an intelligent public lottery should look like with tamper proof records and assuring that there is no corruption of manipulation of information.
06:38:59.708 - 06:39:42.012, Speaker A: And the winners there licore licenses, inspector licenses. This has been very interesting for us because maybe it doesn't happen around the world, but in Latin America there is a lot of distrust in police officers. So imagine there is a police officer approaching you and you can take out your phone and scan a QR and see its blockchain certificate and confirm that there's a police officer, that it's supposed to be there, that the time is correct, that the region is correct. So Todris brings back control to the government authorities and to the citizen. Again, it decentralizes, this sense of trust. This is an example of construction permits being built in the city of Sanicolas. And I can keep on talking about these.
06:39:42.012 - 06:40:30.196, Speaker A: I love these tweets from Asia and Chris Fabian, where last July we closed a moment saying like, we have issued tens of thousands of these different flavors of blockchain digital assets impacting over half a billion citizens in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico and more countries in the region. All these world about trust is about documents and trustworthy. But what if we couple both worlds? The Crypto Fund for AI, the Crypto Fund for Blockchain, and everything that we're building as a platform. Think about governments. They work as we can see. On the left here, they couple pieces, non interoperable silos of data, and on the right, Lego pieces. As a platform, we can couple them together.
06:40:30.196 - 06:41:16.724, Speaker A: See this platform that we have built right now with the help of UNICEF and the Crypto Fund, along with Ethereum Foundation. So any government can have a deployment of this platform. Go to the menu, go to the setup, go to service models. Turn on artificial intelligence for monitoring public spaces or making actions faster, detecting a pothole. Turn on transparency services, turn on public construction services, turn on the blockchain certificates and then start tapping into these portable document holders, these ethereum wallets where we can deposit blockchain or trustable digital assets. No paper, but more than no paper, it's Blockchain behind. This is what we are loving.
06:41:16.724 - 06:41:54.550, Speaker A: And as you can see here on the configuration, we just change the name of the city, change the colors, change the different images, turn on the different models, click Save, and then we have this World Open Source as an operating system for the future of governance. This is how we are imagining systems. Think about this. We can detect a public need, maybe it's an unemployment benefit or another government procedure or service. But think about this simple public need, a broken streetlight. We can detect that from artificial intelligence with an image. And we have the list of issued certificates of providers of the government that can repair that broken street light.
06:41:54.550 - 06:42:57.992, Speaker A: We can match that. And this is where we are stepping right now, beyond identity and do smart contracting with that provider to repair that lamp. And once that happens, we can ask the citizens for a decentralized audit thing where the citizens said, yes, the lamp is working right now, and with a certain amount of citizens confirming that the service has been delivered, we can make the payment. How can you lose $5 trillion with this? Christina just showed us how the pilot of Juniper and Cryptofund, UNICEF IO can track the money that UNICEF is investing in startups like us. Imagine doing that with government. Will you trust a government like this? What we are trying to replicate, it's the App store or the Play store, but for governments, it's the gov store. These pieces of software, these Lego pieces within an open source ecosystem and an open source community to build Lego masterpieces to create this future of government, to reimagine systems with this opportunity that Blockchain is bringing back.
06:42:57.992 - 06:43:36.230, Speaker A: Blockchain gives trust. Government lacks trust. It's easy. We can do that. And this is what Fayasking says is a potential game changer from OECD. And we have been able to build that because of the help of UNICEF and Ethereum Foundation. And what we are aiming is to leverage this concept of the Ethereum ecosystem as the infinite machine, where we are actually tapping not only into the Ethereum network, but also into the Ethereum developer talent to create different solutions that can fix government, because fixing government, fix the places where we live, fix our daily lives.
06:43:36.230 - 06:43:56.140, Speaker A: And I just want to end this presentation saying that this is the time to think about the possibilities of the infinite machine, to transform the public sector, to reimagine the system, but mostly, and very importantly, to reinvent the public sector. So thank you very much Ceci, Christina and the Turin Foundation for inviting us to this presentation.
06:43:57.440 - 06:45:01.490, Speaker B: Thanks, Tree. So we still have a couple of minutes left and I know Christina and I have several questions to you and we could have some fun with those. So starting with a know, I very well know your work and I think it's so interesting. But there's so many words that could be a little bit tricky to come in to a governmental official and start with a presentation of that sort. So I guess my question to you, if you had to think about what do you tell someone that is also looking into blockchain in the public sector? What would you tell them are the one or two biggest barriers in terms of starting these conversations? Like selling a governmental official that never worked with blockchain and may never have heard about what blockchain is, where do you start? And if there's any challenge that you want to show or explain, how do you tackle that?
06:45:02.740 - 06:45:39.150, Speaker A: Thank you, Ceci. Goodbye. I need to leave. I'm just kidding. So you remind me of this panel when the moderator asked me, so are you selling anti corruption technology tools to corrupt people? And I was like, well, at least I'm offering an opportunity to upgrade or modernize their processes, even if they are corrupt. So I guess if you need to start explaining blockchain to a public servant, then you already lost the deal. What you need to explain them is that the Internet came to do something better.
06:45:39.150 - 06:46:47.348, Speaker A: The same way that there is a new technology that is actually made or built to fix their world, the government world as a whole. And as fun as it sounds, most of our current customers, they always wanted to be like the pioneer politician that uses blockchain in the region. So once you see that, once you have the first case, because there is one that has heard the power of blockchain on the public sector, and he or she has been the first one on the headlines of the best newspaper, once that happened, those barriers lower a lot because more of them come. And this, for example, I have very tangible example. This is happening with the lotteries in Argentina when it happened with the university and with the government of presidency. Then the Lottery of Rio Negro, they came to us and they say, can we do this with the Lottery? Can we bring back trust to the Lottery? We said yes, of course. And when we did that, the President of the Lottery called to the Lottery of Neil Ken and to the Lottery of here and there.
06:46:47.348 - 06:47:35.504, Speaker A: And they started sharing. So barriers for us are actually being lowered by word of mouth. There is a first case that understood the power of blockchain and understood the mediatic, the communicational benefits that they have because of using this bet towards transparency and decentralization. Once that happens and more of them start coming. And to explain blockchain, for us, it has been as simple as saying, like, hey, you use electronic signatures, digital signatures. This is just better, it's cooler, it sounds better, it's a QR. And then you start tapping in and you show these 1 minute videos that I shared on the presentation and they start like, literally, can I issue that? And that document is tamper proof? Yes, it's tamper proof.
06:47:35.504 - 06:48:01.624, Speaker A: And is it unique? Yeah, it is unique. And can anyone verify? Yeah. And this starts changing things. And most, for example, think about restaurants. You are based in New York. How many times have you stepped into a restaurant not on Quarantine before. And you step into a restaurant and they have a lot of papers on permits and hygiene and everything that they need to have to be a regulated restaurant.
06:48:01.624 - 06:48:37.184, Speaker A: So now imagine three or four QRS that you can scan as a citizen or as a city inspector, and you click Verify, and that checks in for you as an inspector to confirm to your bosses that you are doing your job. Or as a citizen, you can actually outdit your city. These simple examples, these very tangible examples, seem so futuristic to them that they want them. And this is where we are trying to tap and this is where we are trying to get. And perhaps the biggest challenge is still on, hey, we're going to know where every single cent of your budget is going. Perhaps this is a challenge, but we are still working and walking around.
06:48:37.242 - 06:49:08.528, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. I think the word of mouth is something sometimes we forget about. But I think that's why these platforms that allow this exchange of conversations is so key. Christina, do you want to go next with a question for Choi? Yeah, I think we probably have time for one more question. So I'm happy that I get to get one in Chui. Thank you. Because I think every time we talk, we get to see new examples of how you're actually using blockchain with real people.
06:49:08.528 - 06:49:58.736, Speaker B: And for me, that's always super exciting. I don't know if you know this, but I actually worked in the public sector before joining UNICEF and then worked with governments helping them. So it's always so excited to see all of the use cases that you've listed. Some would say that the public sector tends to be risk averse and I think we've alluded to that a little bit today. But I've also seen I tend to use the public sector as a benchmark in terms of adoption. And when we talk about blockchain applications, obviously Attestations are super important, not as sexy as the DeFi stuff going on for comparison, but it's showing that there's more mainstream adoption. So I guess my question to you is you've talked about Attestations and a whole bunch of use of those and I think that that's amazing.
06:49:58.736 - 06:50:18.570, Speaker B: You hinted at the idea of a digital ID kind of what's coming next. Because I think that that helps me and maybe the general public kind of better understand wider adoption for these types of technologies. So kind of what's the twelve month adoption that you're seeing.
06:50:19.340 - 06:51:00.900, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you Christina. And yes, I remember your dark past. So on the risk averse, first, this is something that perhaps it's most a message for the audience that an answer to you. But this is something that happened to us by working with UNICEF. UNICEF investing in us not only money, but also crypto fund is not only financial support, it's a trust batch. So if we go to the city of Buenos Aires and try to sell an AI service, they say a startup under 20s, under thirty s a Mexican in Argentina.
06:51:00.900 - 06:51:37.056, Speaker A: But when it is no, it's UNICEF coming, bringing someone, things change, risk eradicates vanishes. So this has helped us a lot. And this is a small caps, but also big. Thank you to UNICEF because you have helped us to bridge this gap with the risk of our politicians. That's the first step. And on the roadmap this is really hard because particularly selling to governments during a pandemic has been really hard for us. Really hard for us.
06:51:37.056 - 06:52:34.290, Speaker A: Governments not knowing what they are going to do with their budget, improvising everything, knowing more than ever there is a customer here in Mexico that says Chu. How do you feel that we all know more than ever that we need something that Oscd is offering to us, but we have no money to purchase. So it is like I feel like I'm right, but this sense of I'm wrong in the inside. What we are looking for in the next three months, I cannot think of twelve, I'm honest. But for the next three months is to see blockchain digital IDs used by Argentinian citizens with real government procedures and also because we already have and this is something that we planned strategically and this is why we have so many flavors. It's like having tens of product, but it's just one product. Using differently is to convince or persuade the presidency that we can make the university jump in and lottery jump in.
06:52:34.290 - 06:52:58.590, Speaker A: And so the same citizen with the same ID they can have a government procedure and the university diploma and everything. And these in the next three months will give a sense of the real game changer potential that Fayas was saying with that tweet. Hopefully we can demonstrate before 2020 ends. But at most, my birthday is February 5, so I'm going to give that to me.
06:52:59.680 - 06:53:20.048, Speaker B: Awesome. I'll mark my calendar too, for your birthday, so I send you a message. I think that's super interesting, especially since obviously so many of the folks from the Ethereum community are also in Argentina. So I think that that would also be just really exciting generally to see that move forward. So sending you all of the good vibes for that.
06:53:20.214 - 06:53:22.032, Speaker A: Can I add something on that?
06:53:22.166 - 06:53:23.216, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
06:53:23.398 - 06:54:10.850, Speaker A: Particularly, and this is about the crypto fund, particularly if you live in Argentina and you're expecting a salary in Argentina and Pesos, you love a salary in cryptocurrency. Right? And this has helped us a lot, literally a lot, because having money in Argentina and Pesos, with the economical crisis they are living during this pandemic. And this is me feeling sorry, but at the same time feeling hopeful and seeing Argentina as an opportunity. Having the money in crypto is not only Transparent and Traceable and all the benefits that we have already spoken, but it's about acquisition power. It is the valuation free, it is the politicized. And this is a huge benefit that I didn't spoke and that you just tapped in because of the Argentinian community and the team that we have there.
06:54:11.460 - 06:54:27.160, Speaker B: Yeah, I think those are all super valid points. Okay. With that, I think we have to call it a wrap for this. So thank you to the ETH Global team for having us. Thank you, Chewy. Thank you, Cece. And I'll hand it back over to Kartik.
06:54:27.580 - 06:59:35.644, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Christina, Cecilia and Chewie, amazing talk and really good to get an insight into how you're making a difference in those communities. So really appreciate you giving us your time and hope to see you and what UNICEF does more over the next few months. Thanks, everybody. So we are on our last talk for today and we're going to just take a quick short four minute break before we get there, and after that, we are going to kick us off with our last talk for today and it's going to be a conversation with Vitalik and Tyler. So enjoy the radio for the next couple of minutes and we'll resume in four minutes. All right, we are just about to resume, so given our lag, I'll just wait five more seconds before everybody gets set up on the live stream. Welcome, Tyler.
06:59:35.644 - 07:00:14.720, Speaker A: Welcome, Vitalik, to all of our audiences. Thank you so much for being with us for the full day here. This is our last talk and this is a talk I'm super excited about on my end. And we are super thrilled to be joined tonight. By Tyler and vitalik. Tyler is a professor of economics at George Mason University and the author of a popular blog called Marginal Revolution, and he's also the host of the podcast Conversations with Tyler. He has described his personal windshot as using the Internet to ferment proud enlightenment, and we hope that tonight's talk will aid in that goal in a small manner.
07:00:14.720 - 07:00:55.212, Speaker A: And Vitalik, who should not need a big introduction to our community, he is the inventor of Bitcoin magazine, and now he spends his time as a chief scientist of the Ethereum Foundation. So in 2018, Vitalik joined Tyler for an episode of his podcast Conversations with Tyler. And we want to think of this conversation as a spiritual successor to that episode, but with a slight difference, where the tables will be turned around a little bit. And this time it'll be Vitalik doing the interviewing. So without further ado, I'd like to welcome Tyler and Vitalik on stage, and I'll let them take off with their conversation. Welcome. Thank you very much.
07:00:55.212 - 07:02:11.792, Speaker A: It's good to be here. So 2020 has been such a fascinating year. And I think it's also been fascinating in part just as a culmination of a lot of trends that have been happening for the last 15 years, 20 years we've been seeing with Trump and other political things happening the last four years, just comparing it to the financial cris that we had twelve years ago. Some of the technopolitics that we've had looking at Snowden back in 2013, the copyright wars that were all of the rage in the so I wanted to start by taking a look back at what I call techno idealism more broadly. Right. I think many people view what the crypto space is doing as a kind of continuation of this project of techno idealism. And there's different kinds of techno idealism, right? There's a techno libertarianism with John Peribaro's Declaration in 1996 and trying to establish the Internet as a separate space away from government intervention.
07:02:11.792 - 07:03:13.384, Speaker A: There's technoegalitarianism and nobody knows that. If you're a dog techno world peace, can we just make everybody more connected? Techno efficient markets with your and Alex's post from 2015 on the end of Asymmetric information. And there's been all of the ways in which the world has responded to these ideas and people trying to implement these ideas. So taking a look back at roughly the 25 years since the Declaration of Cyberspace Independence and ask the question, where do you see techno idealism in general? And I guess focused on infotech, particularly as having succeeded, and where do you see it as having failed? Well, if we look at the last eight or nine months, I think we've seen a validation of what you might call, well, capitalized, big tech in the United States, most prominently Amazon. People now trust those companies. They've way outperformed their competitors. It's good for tech.
07:03:13.384 - 07:03:48.816, Speaker A: It may or may not be good for crypto. Right. I think we have also seen a validation of using electronic media, including Twitter, but much more broadly having scientists communicate with each other. That's a very old story. You hear that at the beginning of the techno revolution that this is going to happen, this is the year where it really mattered. We've seen a great deal of progress in understanding COVID-19 and that has been because of tech would not have happened in any other era. So in the last nine months, those are the techno utopian trends that look much better.
07:03:48.816 - 07:04:31.776, Speaker A: If you're asking me about last 25 years, I think what has been underpredicted is just the resulting increase in disorientation and how poorly we as human beings deal with the world where so many things are transparent. Everything is said about everyone, every rumor is out there and we just don't sort it very well. And in the meantime we blame it on companies. That maybe is the biggest trend over the longer time period. So here's a question. Peter Thiel said a couple of years ago that AI is communist and crypto is libertarian. What do you think of that statement? I don't think we know yet.
07:04:31.776 - 07:05:03.192, Speaker A: So we don't know what role crypto will play in the world's future. Crypto looks libertarian now, I'm happy about that. But the story is far from over. AI is in some ways totalitarian. So surveillance seems to be here to stay. Very few citizenries are opposing surveillance. But oddly enough, having more surveillance, while I oppose it, it may in some ways give governments room to open up other liberties for people.
07:05:03.192 - 07:06:10.908, Speaker A: In part China feels as free as it does because there's surveillance. There's not a policeman on every street corner. It's not going to be the case as in the old days behind the Iron Curtain you had to worry about someone coming up to you and grabbing you by the collar and hauling you away. So surveillance has some aspects that make autocratic societies freer. The end of imperfect information in another way, I guess. So one of the interesting things that's been happening, I think both in the crypto space and in the world at large, is there's a conversation about governance. So within the crypto space, for example, we've been seeing things like some of these discussions kind of in Zcash for example, where they as a community have decided to extend the 20% portion of their block reward that goes to fund protocol development.
07:06:10.908 - 07:07:24.168, Speaker A: Bitcoin Cash has been trying to create a developer fund but it's much ended up being a much more acrimonious and unsuccessful process with a lot of opposition in the Ethereum community. We've been having these Gitcoin grants, experiments with quadratic funding. Sometimes the governance has even blown up. So there was this fun incident a few months ago where Justin's Son tried to pull off a kind of hostile takeover of the Steam network and its governance mechanism. And the community reacted to this by making a fork of steam called hive, where they actually deleted the money of Justin Sun and everyone else who participated in the attack. So these things are all happening in crypto. And meanwhile, in the real world, especially over the last month or so, we've been seeing a lot of drama around Twitter, a lot of drama around social media platforms, how those platforms should moderate the challenges that those platforms have in basically trying to be what I call credibly neutral and not just being fair, but actually succeeding in convincing the large mass of people that they're fair.
07:07:24.168 - 07:08:34.744, Speaker A: So I guess the first question is just directly twitter focused, which is, if you were Jack, or in the case of Facebook, if you were Mark, what would you do? How would you govern? Moderation, I guess. And the broader question is, might there be potentially common trends between the things that the crypto space is figuring out and the things that the larger space is figuring out, and might they end up interacting with each other? Many different questions are in there. Let me take it in a slightly different order. Sure. If I think of crypto governance right now, I think there's a great virtue and a great problem, and they stem from the same factor. There's a massive subsidization of resources moving into crypto because these successful assets have portfolio values that were not foreseen initially. So just an incredible flow of wealth into the crypto space that attracts smart people and a lot of experimentations because of those portfolio values, which doesn't at this point require that much creativity from crypto.
07:08:34.744 - 07:09:13.164, Speaker A: You can just hold some bitcoin. If a bunch of companies put 1% of their portfolio in bitcoin, my goodness, the value can go up a lot more. Same with ether. That subsidization also means you don't have discipline on your governance experiments, so people can try all sorts of things. It's hard to tell what really works because there's just this flood or wave of wealth coming your way. So might in a sense be better for crypto in some ways not to have that wave of wealth washing over it. So I don't think we'll know for a long time which of the mechanisms do well.
07:09:13.164 - 07:09:42.688, Speaker A: There's not like a competitive market discipline. It would be like if companies did venture capital, and it just so happened every year billions of dollars of mana reigned on them from heaven. They would get very sloppy. They would take some more chances. Some of those would work. Now, you asked about facebook and twitter, and I think always of the lodge when these topics come up. My historical perspective is that media have always been unfair in every society.
07:09:42.688 - 07:10:15.564, Speaker A: The most part, they've gotten away with it. They don't foresee a near term future where, say, there's a truly decentralized crypto run version of Twitter. I think hardly anyone cares other than people like us. I do myself care. I think twitter will continue more or. Less as is and it will make whatever political finesses are needed. And if Joseph Biden is elected, I think the Democrats will set up a new regulatory agency to cover Facebook and Twitter.
07:10:15.564 - 07:11:05.392, Speaker A: It will somewhat cartelize sector or cement them in as incumbents left higher transactions costs, they'll be more labor intensive, less innovative. We'll ultimately get a version of them a bit like what we have now, except they'll be more risk averse and it will be bad. But I think it's more or less a stable outcome. Just ordinary, say American users. I don't see them leaping to an alternative because there's some complex argument about how it's more balanced or freedom of speech or no one can take this away from you. There's nothing in the previous history of media leads me to think an outcome like that or even the current status quo is unstable. I think some version of it will continue, of course it will change and evolve, but I don't see crypto per se having a major role in the evolution there.
07:11:05.392 - 07:11:49.736, Speaker A: Not soon. I think just sorting out internally which governance experiments are working will be the main task of crypto. Like answering is it just a portfolio instrument? Which is fine, I'm all for that. Is there something you can do with it transactionally that will truly be transformative and the two possibilities are somewhat at war with each other transactionally. You want it to have at least a predictable value but probably also a stable value for your portfolio. You want it to behave in ways not so well correlated with other assets and that means a certain kind of instability or unpredictability. Like here's the weird asset whose beta you don't really understand and that's why it's a great edge.
07:11:49.736 - 07:12:42.472, Speaker A: So there are these two forces tugging on crypto. I don't know which will win. I'm convinced the portfolio demand is real and enduring, but I'm not at all sure which of the governance and transactional experiments are going to work out. No. This just makes me wonder if it is the case that in the real world, there's just not that many people, except for a few idealists, that care about basically the big platforms, being neutral in any sense. Then does that create some kind of pressure for based crypto projects as well, to also end up abandoning those values in the long run? If there is an opportunity to abandon them for competitive advantage, Again, that's a tough question. So I'm not convinced.
07:12:42.472 - 07:13:44.176, Speaker A: Long run future of crypto is libertarian. There's always a way to co opt crypto and the key question will be when crypto truly tries to interact with the banking system, not just at arm's length, how will regulators respond? Will they let banking and commerce in some way merge a long standing dispute in the United States? Or will crypto be forced to play by the regulatory rules of the game, which I suppose I think is somewhat more likely and then crypto will solve a bunch of internal problems. Maybe you use it to send remittances to Mexico. That will become tamed and a kind of conservative thing just on the Twitter question like you and I right now, we could go to Mastodon and say what we want to each other. We don't do that, right? We read each other on Twitter and we're worried about this problem. So I think the rest of the world is somehow going to react and make a fair. I mean, one counterpoint is that there has been this move from Twitter to substack that's really accelerated this past half year.
07:13:44.176 - 07:14:27.820, Speaker A: So it does seem possible for, I guess, new things to start or what's your take on why Sapstack has been getting popular? I think it's people trust the media less, typically for good reason. There's a sense of censorship, but I don't think most of it is from Twitter. I think most of it is from mainstream media and just people learning as they have with crypto assets like, hey, I can make a lot of money this way, which was not focal to them before. So I think there'll be a lot of proliferation and Twitter will be less central than it is right now. There'll be a lot more alternatives. Simple things like WhatsApp? But improved version of WhatsApp will displace a lot of Twitter attention. Clubhouse will displace a bit of Twitter attention.
07:14:27.820 - 07:15:29.680, Speaker A: So I'm an optimist about more diversity, more choice. It will limit the ability of Twitter to censor and that will in turn keep Twitter as more or less a going viable concern rather than some stranger centralized version of it where it's not really run by anyone. I mean, even in the space you work in, it seems to me there's somewhat more governance than there was two years ago. And I asked you this two years ago, I said, as ethereum services become more popular, will there be more or less governance? I think my sense from a distance is things like upgradability matter more and there's more direct involvement and discussion and the kind of dogmatic it's just what the algorithm spits out that seems weaker than it did a few years ago. When you have the bitcoin purists and it has to be bitcoin cash and so on. I think governance and institutions are winning in what is a necessary and probably healthy way. And you're a part of that, congratulations.
07:15:29.680 - 07:16:59.840, Speaker A: But I think it's a little different than your original vision. This is true. I think a few years ago, back when I was first starting on my kind of journey of researching crypto economics and back when I guess I knew less and we knew less, I definitely had more hope that to the extent that governance is necessary. There is some closed formula that could just deliver something close to a good result in a very robust way. The same way that, say, we seem to have for decentralized consensus with proof of work and proof of stake and all of these academic algorithms that are provably robust up to one third fault or whatever that we've had for 25 years. But as I've just studied the issue and studied the economics of the issue, over time it definitely has become clear that there's this kind of fundamental instability in governance that especially happens once your models start admitting the possibility that the different actors in the game are colluding with each other. And so basically something robust that you almost can't even be passive, it has to be active to some extent, like with the example I gave where the attack on Steve by Justin Sangada got responded to with the community rising up and forking.
07:16:59.840 - 07:17:43.752, Speaker A: And Ethereum 2.0, it's fundamentally an act of governance and institutional creation. In some ways it's like the American Constitutional Convention and not very algorithmic. So I think maybe the future for crypto is you have a bunch of very good institutions evolve, often focused around individuals, just like Jimmy Wales is still important for Wikipedia. No matter how much he does or does not do on a given day. He's like a certifier of trust. And then in the nooks and crannies of those systems, you will have micro parts that do, say, all internet transactions with no oracle problem, simply on the strict terms of the original vision.
07:17:43.752 - 07:18:27.144, Speaker A: But whenever you have to interact more with the so called real world, it'll get back more to governance and trust. People will trust, say, you and the foundation and Ether more than they'll trust a lot of other institutions. Again, not everyone. A lot of people just will never understand what you're doing. But I think we're in that world already and we're just going to see this ongoing proliferation of trusted kind of micro institutions. But they have a very long reach in terms of what they enable people to do. No, this is definitely a kind of future that I see as being quite possible a present, you could argue.
07:18:27.144 - 07:18:54.336, Speaker A: Right. I know Ethereum 2.0 is not here in the literal sense, but it's on the drawing board. Pieces are in place, right? It's literally on a testnet. Yeah. When I read your FAQs, like on Sharding and on everything you're doing to make it work better, proof of stake just feels to me like this is an institution. How it works is not being reduced to a small number of dimensions.
07:18:54.336 - 07:20:15.772, Speaker A: That, to me is what is striking. Yes. So one other thing that's just interesting about both crypto and of centralized tech is the somewhat differing relationship between, I guess, non governmental projects, including corporations and including non corporate things and governments that we've seen. Of course, governments being the kind of sole and primary top dog is definitely not the 10,000 year historical norm. And historically we've seen lots of things have intersecting authority, including various kinds of religions and plenty of other things as well. But one thing that strikes me as interesting is that if you look at the discourse, even just going back to Twitter for a bit briefly, there is still a mentality that kind of public and governmental are the same thing. And because Twitter is a kind of, quote, public concern and Twitter affects lots of people, therefore it should be the government, meaning the US government as an expression of the will of the people, actually meaning the US.
07:20:15.772 - 07:20:52.628, Speaker A: People that should have kind of somehow have a say on the whole thing. And I'm, of course, not from the US. I haven't spent more than half a year in any single country since 2013. And even the crypto community is just very naturally global. Like in any non pandemic year, you have people seeing each other in random countries every two months. And I've referred to Twitter before as the world water cooler. So you have people from all sorts of places just kind of seem like they're standing all 2 meters away from each other, just talking to each other in this big cacophony.
07:20:52.628 - 07:21:38.440, Speaker A: And you have people from the US. You got the wonderful diplomats from China. You have all sorts of people from India. There was that beautiful moment a couple of years ago where the government of Iran tweeted out this trenchet message saying, israel is a malignant cancerous tumor in the West Asian region that has to be removed and eradicated. And an Israeli embassy replied back with a meme from Mean Girls asking, why are you so obsessed with me? No, that moment was just great. But just thinking about who uses Twitter, it seems clearly that just from a institution design perspective, the US. As a country is the wrong actor to be kind of having ultimate control of the thing.
07:21:38.440 - 07:22:38.430, Speaker A: And I guess this is why for me, given the kind of imperfect world we live in, I actually think jack calling the shots is less bad than a lot of other people think. But the broader thing, right, is that you do have these centralized platforms that are serving a global audience, but at the same time they are based in a particular country. On the other hand, you have crypto projects that are serving a global audience, and in a lot of cases, they actually are global. In a lot of cases, you can argue in the case of Bitcoin, like 60% of the miners are in China, but then most of the developers are in the US. And some in Europe. How do you see this tension proceeding in the future? I think the two big winners from the Internet are the United States and China. The Internet means a significant increase in one kind of America's soft power.
07:22:38.430 - 07:23:22.008, Speaker A: Some of our leaders have destroyed some versions of our soft power just globally. People debate American ideas. So a big movement in Iran now, I read, is Me too. Where did that come from? Right throughout Africa how people react to Black Lives Matter with a lot of diversity, but that's a major issue. So I think once the immediate moment, the United States will see Twitter and the Internet for a major source of soft power. They cement in English people who are active in the United States intellectual community far greater global reach than, say, Germans do. And that's been a relative shift compared to 15 or 20 years ago.
07:23:22.008 - 07:23:43.728, Speaker A: US. Will accept that. I think other nations already have accepted it. We won't admit it. It seems to me we're already there. We just need to let our mental models catch up to a world we're already living in. Who exactly is defect? So if you're a German public intellectual, your relative status is much lower.
07:23:43.728 - 07:24:12.120, Speaker A: Actually, you probably won't admit it. You don't have the power to do a significant defect from the broader system. In fact, you'll probably be more likely to play by its rules of the game. And to you, Matt, Iglesius will be a big deal, even though in 1968, he never would have been. He would have only been a big deal to other Americans or maybe Canadians. Yeah. So bology has talked about the difference between physical America and digital America.
07:24:12.120 - 07:25:19.088, Speaker A: For example, I personally, I've spent once again, in normal years, less than one 6th of my time in physical America. But would you consider me part of digital America? Yes, absolutely. You can talk about any American issue with great facility, and obviously you've totally perfect, fluent English. That's all you. So I guess this is interesting, right? Because this gets to this kind of philosophical discussion about what America even is, if it's not just the company and the jurisdiction. And it includes these tech platforms, and it includes people who just kind of understand this particular bundle of cultural issues that are affecting this particular kind of bundle of mean. What is America and what is any country? And is the answer different for different countries? It's different for every country.
07:25:19.088 - 07:25:55.548, Speaker A: Keep in mind, America is going to get a big boost once COVID is over, because work from a distance is now much more feasible, even if it's not all the time or every day. So real rents for a large number of people are going to plummet whether you stay behind. Rents in San Francisco are down 31%, or whether you move to Austin, Miami, Nashville, wherever. So that's this big boost to standard of living. It'll make people happier. It'll be a big shot in the arm to the country, and then American soft power is stronger at the same time. We'll be more of a mess.
07:25:55.548 - 07:26:46.824, Speaker A: But I don't see what there is about globalization that overturns that. And then if you think that US. And China will continue to evolve, separate Internets, china remains a bit removed from that equation, and that actually cements the relative status of the US. In some ways. And China will take Cambodia, Laos and some other nations with it. But if you're say Singapore, New Zealand, you're going to play in that big network and basically accept its rules. This is true, I guess if I'm a Singaporean or New Zealand or whatever intellectual, and I interact with this cloud as part of these internet, I mean, I guess you could say that I'm part of Digital America.
07:26:46.824 - 07:28:03.670, Speaker A: But the question would then be that, I guess, to what extent is it legitimate to call it Digital America as opposed to, say, the digital Anglosphere even? To what extent does a physical America or any kind of core end up actually becoming disproportionately the center of the network? I think it's fine to call it Anglosphere, but still so much of it will be American. The emphasis on entertainment is more American than British. If you look at important internet writers, say from Britain, andrew Sullivan moved to America a long time ago. The kind of independent number of truly British kiwi Australian voices. I mean, in absolute terms, it's a lot of people in terms of the gravity of influence, as you would measure in a network model, it's striking to me how American it stayed and what the incentives are to move to either American centers or London or possibly Singapore. There'll still be strong incentives for intellectuals to cluster, and there aren't that many places they can do it. I think London also is a big winner from this.
07:28:03.670 - 07:29:05.210, Speaker A: This is true. The London becoming a kind of cultural outpost of something of digital America is definitely a fun historical irony to some extent. And you see London picking up on American wokeism and political correctness to a considerable degree, and you don't see that on very much of the European continent. And that division, as outlined by Bruno Mashais on Twitter, I might add a Portuguese fellow who writes in English on Twitter. I think that's a big deal. Brexit was a more significant event than we realized. In addition to the obvious changes, the UK or at least England deciding it will be part of the Anglosphere and continental Europe deciding it won't, and on all sorts of other issues like attitudes towards Islam, there's going to be this split, which I think is here already.
07:29:05.210 - 07:30:35.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I made a comment on Twitter at least once, maybe multiple times, where I said that I think in the 21st century people will be divided not less by geography and more by language and gender also. It's a separate point, but I think those are the divisions that will matter. So I guess back to kind of crypto discussions a little bit. So I think a lot of people, especially those who are somewhat far away from the crypto space, see it as being primarily a financial thing. You have bitcoin as an asset, you have ether as an asset. You have both of those systems as a system that you can use to pay people. You have stablecoins there's also a potential for blockchains and other kind of what we call crypto technologies zero knowledge proofs being a really big one as being a base for other non financial applications for example, do you see any potential for non financial applications that use blockchains to get anywhere? And if so, are there any particular categories that you see as being more promising? Keep in mind, as an economist, to me financial things are real things automatically anyway, but I think just enabling new classes of transactions.
07:30:35.780 - 07:31:25.764, Speaker A: So if you're going to run micro prediction markets, and I'm not convinced they will take off, but they might plausibly you would want to do that on a global basis and you would do that using crypto. And crypto will be well geared to support that kind of market that I could well imagine happening, not this year, but reasonably soon as virtual reality develops. There are semiautonomous worlds within virtual reality. If that happens. I'm not an expert on that topic, but again, imagine it happens. You could very readily imagine Crypto being very well suited in its current evolution to enable this very new class of transactions. So those, to me, could be big deals and they're not quite next month things, but we will live to see that happen.
07:31:25.764 - 07:32:03.836, Speaker A: So I think there's a lot of promise but again, we're in this weird governance mix, I don't think anyone has a very clear sense of which of them will work and even simple questions like putting aside crypto why don't we have more prediction markets? You can argue that till you're blue in the face. I don't think there are good answers. I've never met a person who really understands that question. Right. No, it definitely is a puzzle. And especially given how the amount of trading that happens on a regular financial market, as I understand, is much higher than all of the no trade theorems would end up predicting. Then you have all these other markets.
07:32:03.836 - 07:32:20.848, Speaker A: You would think it's obvious they would exist. Oh, a futures market in GDP, in unemployment. They're not there. In the 1980s, they tried a futures market in the CPI. Everyone was convinced that would be a big hit. Went poof. Now, these days, we have lower inflation.
07:32:20.848 - 07:32:55.560, Speaker A: We don't need it. We do. A question of missing markets, one of the central questions of economics. We don't understand it well as economists at all. So a lot of the future of crypto, I think, is tied up with what are your micro foundations for why these markets are missing? It could be it's something so fundamental, crypto won't overcome it. That's a more bearish scenario for Crypto. That could just be they need the right nudge, they need some oil and grease in the wheels, ways of avoiding certain regulations, ways of globalizing more easily.
07:32:55.560 - 07:33:31.470, Speaker A: And then Crypto Will give us this huge takeoff. That's definitely true. And we've been seeing this kind of small but growing explosion in prediction markets on Ethereum in the last couple of months, and I made a bet on the Trump market. I won't say which side, but I'm contrarian, but not super contrarian. So you can probably guess which side that is. You bet on Hillary Clinton to be next president. She is in those markets still.
07:33:31.470 - 07:34:17.816, Speaker A: I bet zuckerberg. Come on. They're definitely getting ease of use has, I think, been one of the kind of drawbacks for crypto historically, right? You have to interact with this blockchain. You have to send one transaction and then you wait 14 seconds for it to get included and sometimes it's four minutes and then you send another transaction. Ironically enough, the time I made a trade on the prediction market, it was a time of very high congestion on the Ethereum network and I paid a transaction fee of $17.76, which is fun. But at the same time we're working on scalability.
07:34:17.816 - 07:35:07.630, Speaker A: We are working on a lot of kind of efficiency things, which there's Sharding roll ups, ZK roll ups, optimistic, all of these buzwords. And if they succeed, the math says that they'll decrease all of those costs by a factor of somewhere between 100 to 10,000. So I guess that might be when the experiment will be. And if it fails, then, then we can really say that it failed because there's no micro foundations. And if it succeeds, then user experience really was the barrier and it'll be very bullish on all the tech stuff you're doing. But let me tell you my worry. If you go back and you look at hyperinflations in history, like look at Israel in the 1970s, there were no practical barriers to denominating your contracts in terms of US dollars.
07:35:07.630 - 07:36:10.288, Speaker A: People wouldn't do so until the rate of price inflation hit about 40%. Now, 40 is pretty high. You might think at eight or 9% they would start thinking about redoing the contract, but they waited until 40. It seemed there were these mental transactions costs that were very high. It's what we see in nominal wage stickiness, which is in virtually all societies, if those are very fundamental and can't be overcome by crypto, overcome by sharding, overcome by greater speed, you're in the more bearish scenario for crypto more generally, and it stays a portfolio hedge asset, but doesn't open up this broad class of new transactions. That, to me is possible too. Does crypto need to become a unit of accounts to open up a broad class of new transactions? I don't think it needs to become a widely used unit of account, but simply to think things through in terms of this other system, this other medium, you might need for dollars and other currencies to be much worse than they are.
07:36:10.288 - 07:36:46.760, Speaker A: And maybe that day will come, right? That's possible too, but it doesn't seem to be now. And just how sharp that substitutability is. That's always the variable I'm mentally trying to estimate, informing my own forecasts for crypto? I'm quite sure. I don't know. No, this is also an interesting question, right? Because there is such a thing as crypto dollars, right? There's stablecoins. There's the algorithmic stablecoins like Dai. There is the kind of asset backed ones like USDC and USDT and so forth.
07:36:46.760 - 07:37:36.908, Speaker A: And a lot of them have very terrible trust properties. Right. Dai is fairly reasonable historically, but USDT is held in some bank in the Bahamas, and I think the terms of service say that the entire $15 billion belongs to them. Something like this. I don't remember the details, but people are still willing to use it and hold it and just use it as the base medium for a lot of crypto trading. So it almost seems like in the short term, I guess the dollar is winning as a base unit of account inside crypto, which is interesting, I guess, in the long run. Will it flip over to BTC or Ether? Both or something else? I don't know.
07:37:36.908 - 07:38:20.260, Speaker A: But there has been this interesting trend right now rise of these stable coins. Heather makes me more bearish on crypto for the reasons implicit in what you're saying. Keep in mind also in world history, exchange rate pegs fixes, they have never, ever held, not in millennia. Breton woods lasted. I mean, it's debated how long it lasted, maybe eleven years. And that was a system backed by all the world's major free countries and a lot of nuclear weapons, and that lasts eleven years. And how long am I supposed to think the stablecoins will last? I'm all for those as experiments, I just think become more floating exchange rates, which I'm fine with.
07:38:20.260 - 07:39:01.672, Speaker A: I wrote a whole book defending that idea when I was starting my career. I don't think stable coins are stable ever. That's fair. Yes, something fat tail risks. Very possible. So going into kind of the macro foundation, the cultural macro foundations for crypto, one of the big ones that a lot of people talk about is distrust in governments. That Bitcoin people, for example, talk about Bitcoin being this trust, this thing that people will gravitate to because they just see how the US.
07:39:01.672 - 07:39:46.420, Speaker A: Dollar is going. As the Meme says, money printer go burr. And they see Bitcoin as having this kind of sounder foundation. Even Bruno made this tweet a couple of years back, using the crypto drama as an example for why people would see the value in more decentralized solutions. And in general, it has this idea that decentralized technology could thrive because governments, as this historically dominant root of trust, are losing. The trust has been fairly large, right? And 2020 has been an interesting year for people's trust in governments. In a lot of places, it's decreasing.
07:39:46.420 - 07:40:44.804, Speaker A: In East Asia. People's trust in their own governments is at a high point, but people's trust in each other's governments is definitely decreasing as well. So I guess how do you see the future of just trust in governments general, in general as being is this something that even can be kind of broken down? Like is financial trust and geopolitical trust different? Are they ultimately the same? To what extent is this a driver for crypto? And I guess where will this go? Well, for thinking about crypto, I would distinguish between trust in government and trust in the Fed. People trust Congress less or Trump less or the other party less. That's very obvious. And it's a big deal socially. But in terms of institutions, fed has had a twelve year run of a totally amazing positive performance in my opinion.
07:40:44.804 - 07:41:11.904, Speaker A: And people trust it a lot more. It's the first place Congress goes, treasury goes there. You need a problem solved, you have the Fed do it. They did okay enough in 2008. This time around they did phenomenally well. It's like Fed and the NBA are our two well functioning institutions. So when the Fed does well, that holds back crypto because it tapers over problems in American banks, banking system and people as well.
07:41:11.904 - 07:41:45.740, Speaker A: I'll use banks because the Fed stands behind those. And the Fed's been doing well, like the NBA does, fit tests well. Now there's two ways of looking at it. One is just Fed is really credible and that will keep crypto at pay for a long time. An alternative view is, well, the Fed has done a great job, but they only have so much credibility and they've spent it down maybe in an optimal way, but they can only pull so much water from the well. And we're getting closer to the Fed not being able to paper over those problems in the banking system. And this is like medium term, very bullish for crypto.
07:41:45.740 - 07:42:25.176, Speaker A: The idea of it takes three days to clear, who gives a damn? I know the Fed stands behind this. All people maybe won't say that 17 years from now and they'll be thinking about safer, more transparent alternatives and that would be a big boon for crypto. And again, there's two very different paths, I'm quite sure. I don't know which is true, but I think a lot for crypto depends on which you find to be the plausible scenario. Yeah, okay, moving on a bit to radical markets. I think last time we talked, we talked a bit about quadratic funding. And back then quadratic funding was mostly just an idea.
07:42:25.176 - 07:43:18.680, Speaker A: It was this paper from myself and Glenn. But since then, in the ethereum ecosystem, I don't know how much you've been following, but we've done these experiments with it, with Gitcoin grants. We have distributed about $2 million with quadratic funding and people seem mostly happy with the results. There have been experiments with downtown stimulus trying to use it in Colorado to fund guess how have your views on quadratic funding and quadratic other things changed? And where do you see the long term future of those ideas being I think they can work. It's been shown they can work. There'll be a greater diversity of many, many things, including those ideas. But when I think about collective choice in general, to me the key input is the quality of voter preferences.
07:43:18.680 - 07:43:58.104, Speaker A: And if you're getting bad outcomes, it's not like, oh, we need a new electoral system. We need to change how the Senate works or move to proportional representation. Those may or may not be good ideas. I don't think they're fundamental. It's the quality of the inputs. What do people want? What does your culture tell people is or should be important? So I'm not sure any of those mechanisms will make a big difference for our largest problems. But I think especially with very well educated communities as are connected to ethereum, there's kind of a lot of things you can take care of more effectively within the model.
07:43:58.104 - 07:44:40.928, Speaker A: The efficiency properties of those methods are clear, and you can use them. Right? Yeah, this is true. Quality of inputs is definitely one of those things that you just can't get around just needing to have if he wants to have good outcomes. So I guess before the audience questions, I wanted to finish off with a overrated versus underrated sector. Oh, of course, yes. Central bank issued digital currencies. I'm worried we will try them and they will suck the life out of our private banks.
07:44:40.928 - 07:45:14.430, Speaker A: I think probably China can do this because its private banks at state are so closely intertwined. It's, in broad terms, one big system. But other countries doing it will either be a minor add on, which I'm fine with, but if it becomes really popular, you end up with your central banks as the intermediaries, your private banks as starved for deposits. Being broadly libertarian, I see that as a bad thing. I think they're overrated, but I'm not even sure they're rated that much at all. Right, but I'm worried about the idea. Okay.
07:45:14.430 - 07:45:49.432, Speaker A: The idea that remote work is making it more viable to move between different countries, and so the market for which country people are residing in will become more competitive. I think remote work is making it much, much more viable to move around within a country. But the costs of moving to a different country, I don't think have fallen very much. A lot of those costs are your personal network. So you could move from Seattle to Vancouver. That still makes a big difference. I don't think new viability of remote work changes that calculus very much so.
07:45:49.432 - 07:46:32.644, Speaker A: Moving across nations will change less than people are saying. Moving within nations is changing more than people are saying. Okay, charter cities and building new cities. In general, people mean different things by the phrase charter city. If by charter city, you mean there'll be some big newspaper article that says this board of, like, eight people, six of whom are white guys, will run a part of Africa, I don't think that will ever happen. At least by charter cities, you mean governance becomes more complex and more diverse. And you have things arise almost like shopping malls today, which clearly have their own governance.
07:46:32.644 - 07:47:11.372, Speaker A: It's just embedded within a broader structure. But they're actual problems they tend to solve on their own, including, of course, security and often adjudication things like trade complexes, shopping malls, enterprise zones will become more significant and sovereign in an actual practical way, and they will be like the vision of charter cities. I think that's very definitely underrated kind of old fashioned. Here's my charter city, let's all vote know. Letting these people run roatan, I would predict that won't ever happen. Okay. Online to offline communities.
07:47:11.372 - 07:48:04.356, Speaker A: So this idea that Balaji has been talking about of communities forming offline and then intentionally coming together in someplace, what is it exactly you mean by that? Like we all move to Austin and eat barbecue together or potentially just people agreed to move to a particular place for a longer period of time. I don't know. Overall, moving in the United States, as you probably know, has gone down every decade since the early 1980s. People move less, they find one place they really like, and they stay there. I think work from a distance will shift one place you find rather than Boston, maybe it's Chattanooga, cheaper, better weather. Over time, it suits just as good as Boston. But I still think your tendency to move only once won't change so much.
07:48:04.356 - 07:48:40.320, Speaker A: But we'll have different one time moves to very different places, and that will matter a lot. I don't think we'll see that much hopscotch unless, you know, the very wealthy who kind of fly around and in some ways don't quite live anywhere. Okay. Virtual reality. It makes me dizzy, and I think I'm enough of an arbitrary subjectivist that I'm not convinced. So I'm not ready to press the button on predicting that one. I'll say overrated, but I could easily, easily be wrong.
07:48:40.320 - 07:49:10.436, Speaker A: My main complaint so brutish and biological and simple and stupid. My argument is so unsophisticated. My argument is either totally correct or totally wrong. And it's probably totally wrong, but I don't quite see the people want to do it. Okay. Small countries as a category, I think they will do fine, but they will attach themselves to larger units. They will have to make choices.
07:49:10.436 - 07:49:40.640, Speaker A: Countries such as Singapore that play a complex game between China and the United States. They will be put in increasingly stressful and difficult positions. But at the end of the day, a lot of them are well run. They have to be well run to stay competitive. And I think we're going to do great. New Zealand now, obviously, with COVID-19, Taiwan, you're seeing a lot of successes that will be replicated as future crises come along. And we had this long stretch of decades with few major crises.
07:49:40.640 - 07:50:11.710, Speaker A: The stupidities of large Bungling countries such as mine in Brazil got away with it, and all of a sudden now they're not getting away with it. Canada is looking mean. It's big physically, but it's like a small country in some ways, especially non Quebec. Canada and Quebec has done the worst. Yep. The United Nations. Well, it's certainly vastly overrated by normal humans who went to public school and were told it was great.
07:50:11.710 - 07:50:43.690, Speaker A: But when I look at actual econometric papers, like, does the UN. Modestly reduce the scope of conflict in the world in those papers? It seems it does. Does the UN. On a regular, very totally regular basis, put out messages that completely offend me? It does. So I don't like it, but at the end of the day, it's still a modest positive, declining all the time in many, many issues. It's just not a player. And again, the public school rhetoric is so over the top, I have to say.
07:50:43.690 - 07:51:20.624, Speaker A: I mean, that's definitely fair. I participated in a model he won in high school, and it definitely decreased my perception of the real thing to some degree. Mars. I'm a skeptic about space travel. I'm not a skeptic about Mars per se any more than any other location. It seems to me the journey is perilous. The experimentation for reentry for normal humans in an age of litigation, complacency and risk aversion is a lot to swallow.
07:51:20.624 - 07:51:58.770, Speaker A: And I sometimes know when Nevada is full, I'll start to think about Mars. So I don't see what's there of value. Unless you have a kind of utopian, libertarian, heiminesque governance scenario, we're going to go there and do things all over again. It just seems the costs and problems and radiation are so daunting and you end up dependent on the government. Seer anyway for getting back and forth, but to me it seems way overrated by those who are enthusiasts. But I'm not sure the normal American is wrong about it. Probably they expect nothing from Mars, and I think that's about right.
07:51:58.770 - 07:52:48.776, Speaker A: So what do you think is going to take the place of peoples and need for some kind of frontier over the next century? Well, we may be frustrated and unhappy from not having a frontier, which arguably is the case now, but I see a lot of advance in biomedicine. It may not feel like a frontier to people, but it could make the world very strange and different, and people will talk about that much more than Mars. Okay, that ends the list of things that I have. So I guess we can have some questions from the audience. Amazing. Well, Metallic, Tyler, thank you so much for that conversation. What we're going to do is just kind of anybody listening, feel free to start posting your questions.
07:52:48.776 - 07:54:29.312, Speaker A: We've had a handful of them already come in, so as we kind of get them, we'll kind of ask them out. I kind of want to start off by sort of more of an open ended question for both of you in this case, Tyler, you kind of talked about some of your opposing views on the use of blockchains and just in general kind of the need for the feature it offers. I guess I'm curious on hearing that from the vitalik side, what are kind of some of the things that you would probably disagree on the most from that argument? I feel like we only heard one side of that argument, but I'm curious to see if there's something what argument do you want me to disagree? So Taller kind of talked about that people largely may not care when we were kind of talking about mastodon and just social media, just the benefits that you would get on censorship, resistance or having control over your information. What do you there's definitely an effect that does happen a lot of the time where people don't care until something personally affects them. But eventually things if it's a bad system, then eventually it will personally affect you. Right? So historically people start using VPNs when something that they personally wants to access starts getting censored. And I guess people will use crypto based solutions when it is the case that there is some specific issue that they personally care about that the existing platforms are not serving them well on.
07:54:29.312 - 07:56:05.970, Speaker A: So I guess it is possible that just big centralized platforms are going to miscalculate massively. It is also possible that even just for lower grade kind of public relations reasons, the existing platforms are going to kind of evolve somewhat in a kind of not fully crypto, but somewhat more decentralized direction. And so one of the reasons why I think this is I wrote this postc a year ago on control as a liability, this idea that if you do put yourself into a position where you have control over a lot of things, that can easily come back to bite you. Now, of course, reducing control, it could mean crypto, but it doesn't have to mean kind of going all out on decentralization. It could even just mean something as simple as establishing some kind of independent governing council as Mark has done and just making that more transparent and letting it have a final say over decisions in some way. It could also mean jack recently retweeted this approach in favor of this approach where he says that people should be free to choose what moderation algorithms they want to use for their Tweet, which is also interesting. So some degree of experimentation of those kinds of things I can see happening.
07:56:05.970 - 07:57:25.076, Speaker A: Fully decentralized things I expect will continue as a niche in the short term. And what they will be in the long term depends on one is if they find a use case. Two is if the mainstream systems just completely break and three, as if we can figure it out technologically when you find it striking how few Chinese use VPN or that TV network news in the US has always been terrible even with cable and satellite. Those would be my comparator points, right? This is true. Well, I guess it depends on what your definition of few versus many is. The number of VPN users is definitely in the tens of millions and those tens of millions may even be the tens of millions that kind of matter more in terms of just their long term impact on global culture. It also, I think, is the case that even if these technologies do not get widely adopted, the credible threat of them getting widely adopted is enough to push centralized actors to be more reasonable.
07:57:25.076 - 07:58:06.470, Speaker A: I guess the go to example of this is the argument that the possibility of people pirating everything in terms of just like movies and music really pushed the recording labels to become more reasonable and start creating things like Spotify and Netflix, which people use now. But arguably if the ability to just illegally torrent things that did not exist as a backstop, the terms would be considerably less favorable to consumers. I was going to see if Tyler was going to respond. No. Next question. Yeah, great. A question for Tyler.
07:58:06.470 - 07:58:55.320, Speaker A: I think it's wrong to think of Vitalik and I as disagreeing. I would say we have different stances. I'm a very detached, distant observer, he is a doer. That's a difference in perspective is more important and our stances might differ. I would admit on all these issues he knows more than I do, would be inclined to bend toward him, just epistemically on that basis. But still, his different role as doer and mine as distant observer will make us feel like we have somewhat different views when maybe we really and it's also it's the time interval that you're kind of debating this on also that matters and shifts that perspective. So I've kind of seen that happen and you've kind of brought up different timelines where this may be important or not important.
07:58:55.320 - 07:59:28.820, Speaker A: A question for Tyler is if you were trying to convince some bright economic students that ethereum was an interesting thing to study, how would you pitch it to them? I'm not sure the pitch matters. I think we need to see that a paper on ethereum and related services can get in a top journal. There are some papers on crypto in top journals there might be on ethereum. Vitalik would know. I don't recall seeing one. And it's all proof. By showing they don't give a damn what you say, they want to see it.
07:59:28.820 - 08:00:34.150, Speaker A: It's probably unfortunate it shows too much conformism and status quo bias. But I think it's how it's working right now. Yeah, and there's definitely been quite a bit of academic publishing on ethereum within the cryptography mean within the economic space. Well, there's those papers that Eric Buddhish has done and there's definitely a few things here and there. Well, there's Tim Roughgarden's upcoming analysis on our fee market reform proposal, the AP 1559, which it's not an academic paper in the standard sense, but it is something that could just end up showing that this is an area that has interesting economics problems that are worth looking at. Got it. Another question for Tyler, and this is more around the audience trying to understand if you have looked at or have followed what's been happening recently in the world of decentralized finance or DeFi.
08:00:34.150 - 08:01:29.080, Speaker A: And if so, kind of what? Do you think about that? As sort of a new enablement in kind of what's possible now, especially using cryptocurrencies and kind of how do you think about that? If you have kind of paid attention to that sector? I read about it a fair amount, but I'm quite sure I don't understand it and I'm not a participant. I suspect it's one of those areas to understand you need to actually try to do it. I would repeat my broader point. Flow of wealth into crypto has meant all these incredible experiments and the creation, literally, of new worlds, new vocabularies. To me, that's just phenomenal and exciting at the same time. It has so weakened the market tests for these things. The normal metrics I would use look at, say, the market for thumbtacks, like which thumbtacks are going to work? Well, I'm not a thumbtack profit, but I sort of know how to figure that out.
08:01:29.080 - 08:02:17.560, Speaker A: I can't do that in these areas. So I read, I listen to podcasts, like also on Gitcoin. At the end of it all, I'm basically confused and I don't see that my mental models have let me narrow it down to questions, reducible to a few dimensions. That's my impression. That's my answer. Totally acceptable answer. A question for Vitalik is for a new developer in this ecosystem, what would you recommend that they start reading to get involved in developing the code base? And I think this is more the way I understand it, towards contributing to the development of ethereum instead of building on top of it, but happy to accept any answers that will.
08:02:17.560 - 08:03:29.182, Speaker A: I mean, I think just going through the process of developing a simple application on top of Ethereum, like even just a simple wallet DAP, or even just a DAP that points to a smart contract and lets you click. A button that sends a transaction that adds one to some number and just kind of walk through that entire process and see what all of the different steps are is a valuable exercise for any new developer to go through. Myself as a learner, I've felt like this just doing and kind of getting into the nuts and bolts of things is generally definitely a better technique than reading for just giving yourself a better understanding of what the heck is going on in different parts, then branching out from there. I think it really depends on what it is that you want to focus on. If you want to focus on building and developing applications, then you might want to look at existing ones. If you're looking at the protocol, then we're talking about ETH one. Are we talking about? ETH two.
08:03:29.182 - 08:04:32.686, Speaker A: Are we talking about layer two protocols? It's definitely just importance to kind of get away of the land in terms of what the space is and what all of these different components are. Ethereum is this big ecosystem and there's a growing number of these just kind of baseline things that you do needs to learn about and keep track of. And then from there, it depends on a specific thing. Once again, if you want to become an E Two developer just poking around the spec, trying to even build a chain or doing the same with ETH one, it's a challenge. But if you want to be a core dev, it's the sort of thing that you do have to just be able to do in principle and then just go from there. Awesome. Next, we have actually a clarification and more of an insight that we would love from Tyler.
08:04:32.686 - 08:05:44.620, Speaker A: You kind of talked about when you were commenting on the US dominance through the media power it has. And the question is, what about the rise of non American Anglo soft power in kind of specifically the world of entertainment? So as kind of the Indian, Nigerian and a handful of other film industries sort of begin to really scale and take off to a lot bigger audiences, do you think that the US. Will still retain that soft power of having control over media content? Or did you mean something else from that point or just kind of what's your reaction to that statement? Well, I think US soft power in movies has always been weaker than people have charged. That was formerly a major trade dispute, that soft power was super strong in Canada and a few other places. But of course, as you mentioned, never in India, the Middle East or many other parts of the world future. US soft power is through the Internet and social media. And that, I think, is still accelerating the extent to which, say, the two of us, by having this conversation in what is North American English, are reaching the whole world.
08:05:44.620 - 08:06:26.086, Speaker A: People haven't grasped the import of that yet. And it's not Hollywood. Hollywood is decaying, not going to have that soft power or carry it being much worse, of course, with COVID but that was already the trend. So I think it's all about social media. Korean movies are better than Hollywood movies. It's not sorry, is that comments on the quality or the reach or the propagation of how many people end up viewing them or sort of is there a specific metric where you measure this against I think there's been an act of self destruction that goes on in Hollywood precisely by trying to reach a more global market. It thumbs down.
08:06:26.086 - 08:07:01.362, Speaker A: The product dialogue is less clever, more things blow up and say, korean cinema, a more extreme example, iranian cinema being directed to much smaller audiences. It's back to this collective choice mechanism. What really makes for good results is a quality audience, and that's the truly scarce variable here. And Hollywood deliberately aims at a not so quality audience. So it becomes crud. It's my subjective judgment, but I think it's true. So here's actually an interesting question.
08:07:01.362 - 08:07:49.726, Speaker A: What do you think about the possibility that AI and Good recent developments with the GPTs and so forth is going to massively decrease the cost of making a movie to the point that a less than institutional actor and even an individual will be able to do it? I think that's already true even without all of those developments. But what's special about movies is people want to see the same movie as what other people are seeing. That means you end up with a pretty high degree centralization no matter what. Just like Michael Jordan, LeBron, they're the best players, yes, but you want to talk to other people about them. So I'm not sure how much it will matter. We'll get this blossoming. It'll mean that the big players will pull from a bigger tent of talent.
08:07:49.726 - 08:08:32.522, Speaker A: That has to be a good thing. Great. But still there'll be the centralization at the top, right? There will be centralization, but the mechanisms that we have for pushing things into kind of massive heights of popularity to the point where they get that kind of position as the thing that you have to watch them because everyone else watches them. Historically, it's been very kind of institutionally driven. And Hollywood makes the movies and they market their movies to hell. But this seems like a process that social media potentially could end up getting into disrupting at some point soon. As you well know, YouTube stars, Instagram stars, are typically bigger than movie stars.
08:08:32.522 - 08:09:28.100, Speaker A: There may be a few older movie stars, everyone knows them because they became famous in this earlier world. But movie stars today, they're not that important. Again, YouTube and Instagram, much more powerful producers of celebrity already. And that's typically not without complex AI or GPT-3. We want to just ask a couple more questions before we wrap today, and we are a little bit over. So I want to thank you for kind of going over it with us. The question is kind of how do you kind of think crypto will shape the regulatory framework around how finance is structured right now? Do you think it'll be in a positive way? Do you think it'll be because we'll force it to sort of meant to allow some of these applications to work? Is that even a valid question to you? How do you react to the regulatory aspect of cryptocurrencies? Obviously, it depends on the country.
08:09:28.100 - 08:10:14.062, Speaker A: The United States, the SEC has been very light on crypto. I would not at all assume that will last. And if Biden is elected, which, as we speak seems more likely. It's almost certainly not going to last. And then there's this longer term issue as banks move into tech and fintech moves into services closer to banking, how will the regulators react when banking and commerce start to mix in the United States? That will have major implications for crypto. I wouldn't say I have a particular prediction, but I think if you want to think through the future of crypto, just the regulatory side, don't assume the light hand is going to last. I would bet against that at least five to one and we'll see what comes.
08:10:14.062 - 08:11:15.938, Speaker A: I don't know. So we'll just do two more questions and it will be for both of you. So the second last question I have is if all we end up with is a really efficient replacement for the existing financial infrastructure and that's kind of the primary and the most exciting use case for blockchains. Is that a win in any count from each of you, as you kind of pointed out? If clearing time becomes 3 seconds instead of three days, is that still a net positive for us or not? For me, I would say that doesn't excite me. But again, there are these options on things like prediction markets, economies, either in virtual reality or in some other future thing that wants to behave in a seamless way that fiat currencies and financial regulation won't allow. I see a reasonably high chance all that can be significant. I'm not ready to predict it.
08:11:15.938 - 08:11:40.170, Speaker A: The exciting side lies in these future dimensions that current institutions have just not evolved to handle and they will be slow and sluggish and trying to do so. And crypto is going to whip their ass if that comes to pass. So that's the exciting scenario. We'll see. We will see, indeed. Great. I'm excited.
08:11:40.170 - 08:12:34.270, Speaker A: That's awesome. So the last question I want to ask, and we want to wrap this up based on this question is it's been two years since your last conversation, at least on air, and we want to see if we can end today's chat with making a prediction on what you think the future of ethereum will be two years from now. I'll kind of take predictions from both side and we'll call it what is it? Two years from now? I didn't hear you. A prediction on the future of ethereum two years from now. What do you think ethereum specifically will be down the road? Whether that's a political answer or a technological answer or a user adoption answer, what do you kind of predict for the development of the ethereum ecosystem? Vitalik deserves the last word, so let me go first. It will be more of an august mainstream institution known to more people. Vitalik will be more of an elder statesman.
08:12:34.270 - 08:13:37.986, Speaker A: It will all feel like more grave and serious, but it will be doing more things. That's my prediction. I think we are going to see just first of all, a continued steady growth. And I'm very hopeful that all of the things that we're doing with technology, including Sharding roll ups, proof of stake, zero knowledge proofs, and all of these things will be continue progressing extremely quickly, the same way that ZK snarks have been progressing extremely quickly in the last year. And this will be as kind of necessary bedrock to enable a lot more applications to happen. And I think we will continue to see, as we have seen historically, people attempt to try to break out and make crypto things that just kind of go viral independently and try to reach larger numbers of people. So two years ago, we've seen CryptoKitties as one example.
08:13:37.986 - 08:14:21.758, Speaker A: I think there are going to be more examples and I think these examples are each going to be more interesting and meaningful than the previous. And once the tech is actually there to handle it, that just when the thing gets big, the transaction fees don't just immediately force it to come screeching to a stop. Like, once that stops being a factor, I think the results may well be amazing. Amazing. Tyler Vitalik, thank you so much for being with us today and sharing your thoughts. I'm sure there'll be a lot more follow ups on Twitter and other platforms and we'll be sure to relay some of those future questions to you. Thank you.
08:14:21.758 - 08:15:00.022, Speaker A: Thank you, kartik thank you. Vitalik a real pleasure and honor. Thank you everyone for listening. Thanks. And with that, I am proud to sort of say that we are at the end of our ETH Online Summit in the month of October. We kind of did some of this summary at the beginning of this morning for the Summits, but this has been an incredible month for us. For ETH Global and ETH Online, we had 710 developers spend the last three weeks working on amazing projects and now we saw twelve of our favorites as our finalists present with their live demos.
08:15:00.022 - 08:15:59.102, Speaker A: And together we contribute 175 projects just in the last three weeks, spanning anywhere from DFI to Scalability, in Ethereum to experiments with governance. And just to summarize how this year has been for us, we've been able to onboard and host 1713 developers over the course of this year by running online and in person events. And together they've contributed to over 470 projects into the Ethereum ecosystem. As I kind of said this earlier today, some of these projects have gone to become well funded companies from just this year. Some of them have been just fun experiments. And the thing that's consistent with all of them is that 100% of these projects have been made because the people wanted to build it for themselves and they really cared about sort of bringing that on and trying that out and just working on it directly and sharing it with all of us. So with that said, I would like to thank all of you for.
08:15:59.102 - 08:16:36.040, Speaker A: Spending the last four weeks with us. And everybody was here on the chat and our speakers today. And last but not least, even though we're going to announce some of our future events soon, we are going to hint about and announce that we will be doing Eat Bogota or our next hackathon that will be in person on August 6 to Eigth in Bogota, Columbia, in tandem with Defcon. So kind of do keep an eye out on this announcement. And I want to thank all of you here for being with us. So thanks again and hope you have a great afternoon and evening and night and goodbye. Good.
