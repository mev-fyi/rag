00:00:00.250 - 00:00:30.920, Speaker A: Kartik, we should be I'm just going to double check the streams and then we should be good to go. Yeah, I see. Yeah, it looks good on my end, so I will leave it to Kartik to start it. And then Kartik, when you're done, you can just turn off your video and it should hide your view.
00:00:31.770 - 00:00:32.918, Speaker B: Sounds perfect.
00:00:33.084 - 00:00:34.120, Speaker A: Take it away.
00:00:34.890 - 00:01:21.318, Speaker B: So welcome everybody, our panelists and all of our attendees and also the general audience that had the ability to kind of just sign up and tune into this panel. So I'm Kartik, one of the co founders of Beef Global, and I wanted to just kind of give everybody a quick update on Hack Money and what's going on with that. So before we kind of get to the actual good stuff, which is why you're here, I'm going to bore you with some infomercial spam. So Hack Money is our first ever online hackathon that's focused on DeFi. Eve Global has been doing this thing for two and a half weeks now. So this is week three of our four week event. And as a quick update, things are going amazing.
00:01:21.318 - 00:02:04.782, Speaker B: We have some of our amazing DFI sponsors. A lot of them are on this call and they're all working towards having over 350 hackers build really cool D Five projects. We are just in the process of sort of collecting and guessing, or rather sorry, estimating the number of projects we're going to see as submissions and sort of what they're going to be building. And so far that number is going to be just a little bit over 100. And it's just crazy because in two weeks from now, we're going to have about 100 new D Five projects in the space. And I'm perfectly comfortable saying that this actually doubles the number of D Five projects that exist very immediately. With that.
00:02:04.782 - 00:03:25.610, Speaker B: As a quick update on everything that's happened with ETH Global and Hack Money, this event is two more weeks from finishing for participants that are on the Zoom chat, we'll be kind of covering over what happens with judging for your hacks. In the coming few days, the 100 plus projects will get to submit and talk about what they built on another live stream like this thing in general. And on top of all of that we have our amazing kind of mentors and sponsors that have been sort of on our discord channels kind of helping out and anything from technical to just general mentorship. Just making sure that everybody who is trying to work from 15 different time zones is getting the help and support that they need. So as part of one of these events sorry, as part of the Hack Money, we're doing a panel like this to kind of have a lot of you get the opportunity to ask and learn a bit more about some of the projects in this space. So I won't go into the individual introductions. But I do want to introduce Camila Russo, who works at and is the co founder of The Defiant, and she will be interviewing our panelists and asking them questions about some of the cool things that they're working on and sort of what's next for their projects and what's DeFi in DeFi.
00:03:25.610 - 00:03:29.870, Speaker B: So with that, please welcome Camila to take the stage.
00:03:30.530 - 00:03:59.142, Speaker C: Great. Hi Kartik, thank you so much. Thanks for having me here at Hack Money. Very cool to have a DeFi focused hackathon. So I'll quickly introduce our amazing panelists and then we'll get to it. There's a lot to so okay, so we have Hayden Adams, he's the founder of Uniswap, a Decentralized Exchange automated market maker. Stani Kulichov, founder at Ave.
00:03:59.142 - 00:04:24.406, Speaker C: A decentralized lending protocol. Johan eid or eid. Okay, sorry about that. Jonathan Eid, he's a product manager at Decentralized Oracle provider chainlink. Harriet Lambert. He's co founder at Buma decentralized Synthetic Exchange and Issuing platform. And Calvin Leo.
00:04:24.406 - 00:05:09.280, Speaker C: Strategy lead at decentralized lending protocol compound finance. So lots of decentralized in the project descriptions here. So I wanted to start with asking this question to everyone in the panel specifically about what you're expecting to see at Hack Money. So what do you think is the big thing that's missing in DeFi that would make the sector more attractive for users to increase adoption? What do you hope to see come out of the hackathon if you want to start?
00:05:12.550 - 00:05:55.434, Speaker A: Sure. I mean the youngest first, right? Yeah, but I would like to see a lot of DeFi is pretty much focused now. A lot. For example, we have different kinds of, for example, stable coins or interest bearings for example, like Adai CDI and so forth. And everything's focused a lot on kind of like the US audience. And I think what could be very cool to see is that kind of like the DeFi accessibility should be more global. So kind of like people who participate in DeFi, they have kind of like equal chances.
00:05:55.434 - 00:07:06.120, Speaker A: For example, from Europe, for example, if you're earning in Euro currencies or pounds and you kind of don't have the foreign exchange currency fluctuation risks involved, so it's more easier. And of course a bit of adoption through DeFi and benefits of the DeFi seen in other parts of the globe. Actually, speaking of the globe, this is the coolest thing ever I found. I haven't seen these things for a long time, but I think this represents very well the kind of like the hackathon, because people are participating here in many different countries and that's very democratic thing because you don't have to travel to this hackathon and it's virtual. And that's like what I'm expecting from this particular hackathon, that we'll see more use cases where other parts of the world could actually benefit and also that some of the hacks actually help different parts of the globe. So that's like something very big I'm looking into now.
00:07:07.050 - 00:07:13.080, Speaker C: Nice. Definitely. That definitely goes with the purpose of DeFi. Right. Hart, want to go?
00:07:15.690 - 00:08:47.430, Speaker D: Sure. I mean, I think Cammy, the way I look at this, I like to think of almost a competitive way. How does win, like, what does DeFi do and what is the aspects, what does DeFi enable that nobody else can compete at? What's its unfair advantage? And so I think it's actually really interesting to think of this in comparison to centralized finance, to CFI, which also you could say is traditional finance, like Binance and BitMEX and Coinbase, they can do ETH trading, they can do stablecoins, they can probably do some synthetic assets. What is the stuff that DeFi can do that Binance, Coinbase, BitMEX just really can't do? And what is the stuff that's going to actually suck new people or new energy into the decentralized finance ecosystem? Because I don't think we all believe, we're all believers, that decentralization is the right ethos, but I personally want to not rest on that as the thing that's going to have this space win. What is the stuff that we can do and then to make it more concrete, the personal tokens, some of this really new innovative financial products. I think that's where DeFi has the opportunity to innovate. And these hackathons are examples of where people can innovate at a speed and in kind of the advantage of the permissionlessness that we all have, can innovate in a way that other more centralized options just can't compete.
00:08:47.770 - 00:08:59.734, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, I agree. Projects that just can't be done in centralized finance and traditional finance are my favorite things about DeFi. For sure. Hayden, how about no, I mean, I.
00:08:59.772 - 00:09:40.840, Speaker E: Completely agree with Hart. I want to see more things that can be done outside of DeFi. I want to see more highly experimental things. I want to see really weird things that you just are like, wait, really? That's weird. But a good example of things that I hadn't really thought about, right? Like flash loans. Those are stuff that I hadn't really thought about what you could do with that sort of thing until DeFi or some of these kind of experimental something kind of exciting in the uniswap area is these rare physical goods that people are issuing limited edition stuff and selling. So yeah, I definitely want to see more experimentation on that front.
00:09:40.840 - 00:10:13.406, Speaker E: Something that I also am pretty interested in for this hackathon because it's like a longer form hackathon. Usually it's like two to three days and so you end up having these really janky UXs, but with a kind of a cool idea behind it. I would be very interested in seeing higher quality UX behind the projects because I think that UX is one of the biggest things holding the space back. And so seeing real UX experimentation and kind of new ideas on that front would be super cool.
00:10:13.588 - 00:10:25.650, Speaker C: That's a great point. Yeah, it is a longer hackathon. So the bar has been raised to just deliver like a more finished product. Johan, how about you? What are you expecting?
00:10:26.150 - 00:10:56.238, Speaker F: Yeah, sure. I mean, on my side, I do feel like DeFi in its current form, already offers some great alternatives to the people in the traditional world right now. A lot of these people, I feel like, don't know the option that DeFi is. Basically, to me, DeFi is a great option. It's not the end goal. It's an option for everyone to be able to switch off from the traditional system that they know today, and to have something better, to have something where they have ownership of their assets, to have something where they don't trust the central custodian. Right.
00:10:56.238 - 00:11:29.578, Speaker F: But I'm starting to realize that a lot of these people are completely oblivious to DeFi. Right. Even more than for bitcoin. Like in the early days of Bitcoin, at least in Venezuela, you would hear of people buying some bitcoin because the government was inflating the money supply. And same for a lot of countries similar to this. Right. I feel like DeFi currently should probably aim, and I think I can join what Stani was saying here, to speak to demographies which aren't the same demographies in the Western countries, like Europe, like the US.
00:11:29.578 - 00:12:17.142, Speaker F: But try to onboard people who really need this stuff right now, today, like in South America, in Africa, I think that would really be the goal. And in this case, it's also having great, UX, great products which can allow people to easily transfer fiat, to have access to local currencies also, which are not only the dollar, but maybe the pesos, maybe the one, maybe a bunch of other currencies. Currently everything is indexed on the US dollar, right, like is indexed on USD. And I think it would be great to see some more openings there and being able to speak to people who are more from the traditional world. Because today I feel like DeFi is really addressed to the people who are already in the ecosystem. Right. To the people who've been in Ethereum for two, three years.
00:12:17.142 - 00:12:34.334, Speaker F: I've never seen anyone who just joined Ethereum and went to DeFi directly. That's something I haven't seen yet. And I really hope it does happen soon because I think the world really needs it. When you look at the situation today, I think the world will really need it, basically.
00:12:34.532 - 00:13:03.606, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Yes. Opening up D Five for both traditional finance and traditional web, or Web Two, and also from people from maybe emerging economies who haven't participated as heavily as people from developed countries in building all this stuff. Last but not least in this panel, calvin, what do you know?
00:13:03.628 - 00:13:29.822, Speaker G: I agree with everything that's been said. I think I got into crypto. A lot of people got into crypto because here, I think, got into crypto because it's a little bit of an outsider perspective. So we like weirder stranger things. We want to see a lot of experimentation. A hackathon is sort of a perfect breeding ground for experimentation without a lot of constraints. I also agree that basically broadening the audience of DFI is really important.
00:13:29.822 - 00:14:23.798, Speaker G: I think would be really interesting. There is as you just kind of alluded to more bridges between web3 and web two. Especially like stable coins are a pretty straightforward or clear bridge between dollars and DFI. So continuing to build out those connections but also give three really specific ideas just because they're really top of mind. For me at Compound I have a big focus sort of understanding what might bridge the gap between large financial institutions or funds who use centralized interest rate markets like BlockFi or Celsius or Genesis and products like Compound or Aave. And I think there's really three main problems. One is basically credit extension.
00:14:23.798 - 00:15:11.866, Speaker G: So no matter how trustless or not trustless, this is the ability for somebody on Aave or Compound to take their unused borrowing power and give it to somebody else. Liquidation alerting. So right now you basically get instantly liquidated if you are margin called and that's basically untenable for a lot of institutions. They need to have a day to respond and then also liquidation insurance which is really related to the same idea. These institutions have the collateral available but they have it but they just don't want to be severely over collateralized because it's an inefficient use of assets. So credit and liquidation are two big problems that I think can really increase the usefulness of interest rate markets in DeFi.
00:15:12.058 - 00:16:38.486, Speaker C: Right? No great points and great to have concrete examples of how DeFi can be better used by maybe larger users companies or just like larger whales because lending is the main use case right now. So yeah, it'll be good to see these ways to just make it better and more usable. Okay, so I want to go over to talk about composability. This is kind of one of the main features of decentralized finance. I mean the way that all these DAPs and protocols can work together and combine to farm new products and just enabling so much innovation which has been great, but it's also opened up the space, some would argue to vulnerabilities and attacks. And so to address this I'd want to go to Hayden and Stani to get us started on this topic. I mean, unisoft's price feeds and flash loans have been kind of two Lego pieces that have been used by attackers to exploit these systems.
00:16:38.486 - 00:16:49.070, Speaker C: So what do you mean maybe, Hayden, you can start how can developers and builders stop composability from becoming a curse?
00:16:49.410 - 00:17:55.678, Speaker E: Yeah, so I'm going to start by saying that I have never in my entire life said that uniswap v one should or could be used as a price feed safely by an external system. And so that kind of maybe is my so I think what I would say here is that if you have a permissionless, decentralized system. On some level, you have to accept that people are going to do stupid things with it and do things that aren't safe with it. I think it's important if you're building a project to very clearly message what your project can and can't do. And maybe you can improve on things so that it can do some of the things people want to do with it, but that's kind of a separate thing which is like really, you want to clearly message this is what you can safely do, this is how you can safely do it. You want to clearly warn people of the risks. And then anyone participating in DeFi should say, is this something I want to put my money in? Is this something I want to use? Because I think that these protocols like Uniswap and Compound, they're becoming these building blocks for these other more complex systems.
00:17:55.678 - 00:18:33.460, Speaker E: But people have to be careful with saying, oh well, just because something uses Uniswap or something uses compound doesn't mean that system is safe, even if Uniswap and Compound are safe. So it's just something that where it's really like. You should exercise caution when using any project that's composing other projects. And that's not to say that those projects can't be safe, in fact they can be safe and they can be great and there's all sorts of ones that I love, but I just think it's about exercising caution. But I don't think that we should stop innovation and stop pushing the bar forward. So I'll touch on the flash swapped as well. I'm a flash accelerationist myself.
00:18:33.460 - 00:19:46.280, Speaker E: I think that if a project can be completely broken by flash swaps, then it can be completely broken without flash swaps. If you have a bunch of ETH the same way that you could flash swap some ETH, and then you could use that to push some price on Uniswap and then that breaks an external system that's using that price unsafely. If you have a lot of ETH, you could just do that directly, or if you need another token, you could just put it in compound and borrow it directly. And with enough ETH, you can push the price on anything on Uniswap a large amount and you don't need flash swaps to do that. And so it does lower the barrier of entry to kind of messing around with things, flash swaps potentially, but anything that would be completely broken by them is inherently broken in my mind. And I think that flash loans and we've been experimenting with something we call flash swaps at Uniswap, I think that they actually are a real important use case. There are many transactions where the upfront cost is a lot higher than the net cost.
00:19:46.280 - 00:20:22.322, Speaker E: So for example, if you see you can sell some ETH for Dai on Uniswap and you could maybe sell that Dai for ETH on another trading protocol, potentially the net cost of that transaction could be zero or even negative. So it doesn't actually cost anything. But there's like this initial upfront capital requirement and so stuff like flash loans and flash swaps, they really lower the upfront capital requirements, which I think is something that is decentralizing in nature, where it allows more people to participate in stuff like Arbitrage rather than just whales. And so I'm a big fan of it.
00:20:22.456 - 00:20:56.640, Speaker C: Right, okay. So I guess what you're saying is innovations like flash loans and flash swaps actually drive the DeFi and just finance forward because they make it more efficient. And so just because they're being used by an attacker doesn't mean that that mechanism is flawed itself, just that the system that is able to break because of a flash loan was poorly designed in the first place.
00:20:58.450 - 00:21:30.810, Speaker E: Yeah. And I will say that if people are using your product, if people are using a protocol in a very unsafe way, it does probably point to things, an opening for improvements and an opening for something. Like if people are using something that's unsafe, then that means that they want a safer version of it probably it just might not exist. So that's something we're doing with Uniswap V Two, we created sort of a more robust framework for decentralized price Oracles on top of Uniswap that is more manipulation resistant. Although.
00:21:34.190 - 00:21:35.660, Speaker C: Stanny, what do you.
00:21:37.630 - 00:22:51.806, Speaker A: Honestly, definitely what this national definitely showed that what you're capable to do, basically being a developer or a nerd, sitting in your mom's basement and drafting a piece of scripts and just basically doing these very amazing things for good and bad. So I think as Hayden said, that flash loans aren't basically something new. I mean flash loans are just kind of like lowering the threshold of capital required upfront to do different kinds of transactions in terms of composability. So in terms of like when we look previously what kind of attacks we had during this years with flash loans, what we can see basically that those particular attacks could be done just by having that well like capital. And I think it's just about building systems that are resilient to different kinds of attacks. And that's why basically we have different kinds of Oracle systems in place. For example, if you're using Chain link and also the unispot version two and so forth, so these kind of things are pretty much like improvements.
00:22:51.806 - 00:23:55.702, Speaker A: But in terms of composability, it really is a fascinating feature because if you look at the flash loans that for example Aave has, one of the interesting things that it provides is basically more liquidity and kind of like spreads the liquidity inside the whole DeFi ecosystem. For example, there was interesting brainstorming I had with Mariano Conte from Megadao and basically I wanted to swap a CDP vault from one collateral without under one without actually returning the loan. And that wasn't possible. And we came up with kind of like a conclusion that you could actually use flash loans to do that. And then I just tweeted about it that, hey, actually this is pretty cool. Is someone interested in building this? And I would just use it from the day. And David in Twitter basically came and said that, hey, I will try to build something out of in four days.
00:23:55.702 - 00:25:08.094, Speaker A: He basically created collateral swap with the use of the flash loans. And the cool part is that basically you can swap your CDP collateral from one to another. And the compatibility here is pretty awesome because you basically flash borrow from abe die and you close your CDP let's say if it's VAT collateral, which you're long sell it, for example in kyber or uniswap for ETH and the collateral and open a new CDP, get the dai and return it to Aave. And also you can do even more core things. This is just like start you could basically actually refinance the whole loan so instead of doing just collateral swap you could add more transactions in between the borrowing and returning the loan you could actually refinance the whole loan into compound. For example if you find that there is even lower rate loan in USDC. So what you're actually doing, you're basically doing collateral swap, interest rate swap and currency swap and to make it even more interesting you can put just like an automated bot running this for you and make it as a service and also running liquidation service on top that uses flash loans like DeFi Saver does.
00:25:08.094 - 00:25:49.450, Speaker A: So you can go like so many layers on this compatibility and I think what's the key here is that actually you're taking liquidity from one place to another and just kind of like using the whole space for you and building this kind of products and cool part is that it's also like human compatibility. So let's say David builded the collateral swap and basically he's a developer, this is a developer tool and then end users start to use it. So you're actually building completely new products without actually having that upfront capital and I think it's a huge difference that actually is very important especially like hackers in this hackathon.
00:25:49.970 - 00:27:10.182, Speaker C: Yeah, no completely agree. I mean the number of things that can be built because of this composability feature in DeFi is absolutely mind blowing and I think it's definitely one of the things that makes DeFi more likely to win because it is a competitive advantage with other systems that don't have it. But you mentioned this idea of layers and it's something that I want to talk about because beyond attacks the question of whether all this composability and DApps working together, whether this raises systemic risk in DeFi the possibility of Maker being such a big part of it that if it breaks, it takes so many other different applications down with it. Or just as an example, let's go to Calvin for this one. What do you think about know potentially that composability increases systemic risk in DeFi and how to prevent it.
00:27:10.316 - 00:27:11.000, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:12.890 - 00:28:11.750, Speaker G: I think that it does increase systemic risk. I think that composability sort of interconnectedness is part of the goal here. If we're trying to build like a fully robust functional system of sort of financial alternatives to what exists in traditional finance, they're going to have to be connected. I don't think that when there are issues that happen because of composability like exploits or people lose money, people like to say, oh, DeFi is just learning the lessons that traditional finance has learned in the past, like these overly complex systems that nobody understands that fail. It's going to get complex. It's complex, and it's going to get much more complex. I think sort of the hope is that there are two really main differences in these DeFi projects that hopefully kind of cure for the issues that come with complexity that aren't true in traditional finance.
00:28:11.750 - 00:29:01.420, Speaker G: One is basically radical transparency, like the fact that everything can be tracked on. And then two is really community ownership or community stakeholders, whether through tokens of protocols or whatever different other methods. So these are two things where in traditional finance you have some bank, which is an entirely black box, completely non transparent and owned by some set of centralized entities instead of the users. Those two things are radically different in DeFi. And I think the hope is over time it will lead to an entirely sort of different, safer approach to composability. We're still really early. Complexity is dangerous or can be dangerous, and I think obviously it has been and it probably will be going forward.
00:29:02.830 - 00:29:11.306, Speaker C: No, but great point about transparency, maybe mitigating those risks. Johan, what do you I mean, I.
00:29:11.328 - 00:29:54.118, Speaker F: Agree that there are risks, risk composability, right? I mean, on our side, at even, it's even another facade which is basically connecting on chain and off chain, like connecting with the real world, right? And that's also interconnectivity composability, like being composable with real world legacy systems. Basically having DeFi be able to discuss and to speak with these systems on my side. Of course I do think there are risks. But it's like with everything. If you build a product and you always have in mind end to end security and you apply the principles, which are basically the principles on which Ethereum was built on. Right. Transparency, decentralization, good enough incentive systems.
00:29:54.118 - 00:30:50.826, Speaker F: I do think that you can provide a layer of infrastructure which is good enough for projects to build on, right? And again, I think DeFi and everything we're doing here is just about options, right? As a user, I have the option to use this protocol, and as this protocol, I have the option to plug into another protocol and to plug into something else, right? So since I have this option, I can always check how secure is this protocol, what does it do, what are the risks here? Right? And am I putting my users at risk whenever I'm going to plug into something new or into a new source. Right. So I think it applies for oracle. Do I think this Oracle system is safe? Do I think I can use it to get real world data? Do I think I can use it to check the price of Dai right now? If it's safe, then I should use it, and protocols can plug safely into me, right into what I'm doing. Otherwise I shouldn't choose it. Right. So I do think there is risk.
00:30:50.826 - 00:31:25.720, Speaker F: Of course there is always risk. The traditional financial system isn't exempt of it, actually, I think because there are no options in the traditional world, since everything relies on the dollars. Once the dollar falls, what happens to the traditional world? I do think it's a huge strength for us to have this composability, and I would think that if it's done well, there are risks, but the benefits are ten times higher than your risk if you look at what you have at the other option.
00:31:26.170 - 00:31:45.930, Speaker C: Sure. And Hart, I wanted to ask you, you come from traditional finance, right? So how does systemic risk there compare to systemic risk in DeFi? In what ways? Is it maybe riskier or less or not as risky?
00:31:46.090 - 00:32:22.298, Speaker D: Yeah, no, Cammy, that leads in perfectly to what I was going to say, which really underlies a lot of what Calvin said. I would reframe your question. Composability exists in traditional finance. It just exists without transparency. Like hedge funds literally just move money from one place to another and put on these complex trades. And I actually think you even have some examples. There was something called the futures basis trade that cost a bunch of hedge funds probably a couple of billion dollars just last month that blew up when the markets did some crazy things.
00:32:22.298 - 00:33:12.650, Speaker D: And that's an example of a particular hedge fund arbitrage strategy that completely relied on composability in traditional finance. This is trading futures versus cash bonds and doing all this stuff, except there was absolutely no transparency into who had those positions, what was going on, what the risks were. And so I really know Calvin's point, the radical transparency. This is just a different set of trade offs. Composability here, or the money Legos thing does definitely create risks, but it's completely a different framing. Given the transparency and given the ability for like Stanny said, some dude in his mom's basement can kind of be the guy to figure out some of these risks. And there's this community centric approach to security that I think is really powerful.
00:33:12.650 - 00:33:15.100, Speaker D: So I think it's just a different trade off.
00:33:15.710 - 00:34:18.986, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting. I think maybe when we're so deep into DeFi, we kind of forget that this happens in traditional finance too, that everything is connected, but just in a more opaque way. And when things break, it's even more catastrophic than when things break in DeFi. Okay. And. Then I want to now talk about governance, another kind of huge topic in this ecosystem and starting out with the protocols represented here that have governance tokens and a more kind of active community led decision making system. So it's been kind of a really interesting trend to see lots of platforms introducing governance tokens to allow this transition of a more community led system and increase decentralization.
00:34:18.986 - 00:35:16.740, Speaker C: But at the same time, the example we have so far, or I guess the biggest example we have so far is MakerDAO system and voting in MakerDAO has its pros and cons. But one of the things that is hard to oversee is how little participation it has. So how do you kind of balance that like handing over governance to a community, but then have it be so concentrated that it doesn't actually achieve the goal that it set out to do of being more decentralized? I want to get opinions from Calvin Harden, Stani As, Compound, Aven, Uma, all are introducing tokens in some ways within their system. So Stani, why don't you start?
00:35:17.910 - 00:36:41.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the interesting parts is that when I look at the governance system is first, what are they governing? Usually pretty much you're either governing monetary policies, whether there are parameters in the software or the software itself. And I think what the governance allows basically the community to do is to kind of create a product that they want to support. And one of the things that I'm mostly afraid of, I think basically we kind of know what are important things and what are not in terms of governance. But I think what I'm kind of scared is that the governance models that we have will pretty much we have entities governing the protocols and the software that are actually there is less power for the actual users to govern. And this is kind of like something that we are trying to figure out that how do we keep a governance where basically we don't have whales or big players deciding or venture funds. I mean, venture capital is very tied into the ecosystem. It's basically an ecosystem where kind of like venture capitalists see that there is a lot of potential here.
00:36:41.790 - 00:37:30.530, Speaker A: They want to invest in the space and they want profit. No one is in this space basically to make only good things. I mean, definitely they are, but they are also here to basically get monetary benefit. And my biggest fear is that that goes beyond basically what the actual user or the community needs. And that's why I think that's very important that we're able to have protections in the governance systems that actually users have lot of say on the product that they're using on a daily basis. And basically that's very difficult to achieve in a token based governance. There are mechanisms to do, of course that and another thing in terms of monetary policies is what's important is the open sourceness.
00:37:30.530 - 00:37:50.660, Speaker A: That pretty much that the Token based governance that they govern open source protocols. Because the issue with proprietary code is that you are kind of governing something that might be someone else's property and there might be claims or those conditions that you are governing might not.
00:37:52.390 - 00:37:52.850, Speaker B: Basically.
00:37:52.920 - 00:39:03.786, Speaker A: Have legal kind of oversight in what you're governing. So I'm trying to figure out how to make the open source work in the token based governance. And that's something that I'm really into that and I think one model that works very well is that there is protocol based governance, basically the maximum things that the protocol can do and minimum things. And there could be kind of like a macro level governance in terms of in the actual usage. For example, in August case, what we're doing now, we're going to announce a governance protocol where we have two folded governance. So we have so called macroeconomics where the whole protocol is governed in terms of parameters and monetary policies, but also each and every money market that we are launching. And the next one is basically using uniswap liquidity LP tokens as a collateral and also everyone who is participating in that particular market have power to actually participate and decide what kind of parameters there are in this particular market.
00:39:03.786 - 00:39:15.886, Speaker A: So it's kind of like a balance between the macroeconomics and microeconomics and that's something that we are trying to figure out now at Aave no interesting, I.
00:39:15.908 - 00:39:59.530, Speaker C: Mean, it's a really untested space, so we'll be great to see how these experiments turn out. Calvin, at Compound, I mean, you recently started issued the Comp Token and I think just had two new proposals within the system. So how are you trying to make governance actually achieve this goal of being more decentralized? I mean, for now, tokens is only used by shareholders of Compound, right? It's not even distributed widely within users. So how do you get to that path?
00:39:59.870 - 00:41:25.494, Speaker G: Yeah, I think I can sort of talk to my personal perspective. Governance is very complicated. I think everyone on the Compound team probably has a slightly different perspective. But I first got into just for a little bit of context, I first got into crypto and really bitcoin because I thought it sort of merged these strong interests I had in technology, economics, philosophy and really how do you design systems that are useful and good for large groups of people? They manage incentives, right? And somehow huge groups of people are able to sort of work together, collaborate or achieve amazing things in these really complex systems in society and the traditional economy. And now I think in DeFi you're finally starting to see a ton of experimentation that's a little bit more along this sort of economics and philosophy really like how do you organize a community of people line of thought and you see a lot of mostly technologists now moving into this world of political theory. Basically vitalik is someone who has been brilliant at this. A lot of people are, but it's a very different beast than solving technical problems.
00:41:25.494 - 00:42:09.282, Speaker G: I think when you talk about governance, you're talking about human problems. I think you look at governance in just the world, in political systems, and it's an unsolved problem. It's a problem that probably has a different answer in society every couple of years. So I don't think there's going to be any hard and fast rule to what is a good governance system. I don't think any DeFi governance well, first of all, all DeFi governance systems are super young except for maker. And even there's just like a constant process of experimentation. But I don't even think we have really great definitions of what is the ideal amount of decentralization.
00:42:09.282 - 00:42:15.800, Speaker G: We don't even have a great definition of what decentralization is. All that said is just.
00:42:19.550 - 00:42:20.074, Speaker F: We think.
00:42:20.112 - 00:43:01.206, Speaker G: Novel and experimental token distribution plan that's coming for tokens to be basically distributed to users of the compound protocol, it'll be another experiment. DFI itself will probably need 100 more experiments to get to a point where there's a really robust governance system in any project. Governance is really kind of months old. Avid's token, kyber, they're all these synthetics. There are all these new sort of governance aspects that are being added tokens that are just months old. So it's really early, but I'm excited to see what comes next, obviously.
00:43:01.388 - 00:43:38.690, Speaker C: Yeah, it's hugely ambitious. Like you said, all these protocols are trying to solve technical problems that have been untested, but also like societal problems with solutions that have also been untested. So it's an incredible undertaking. And I want to, with this question, go to out of I think everyone here, uniswap is the only protocol with no token and really minimal governance. So why did you decide to go with this path?
00:43:41.510 - 00:44:13.642, Speaker E: Sorry, I had to unmute. Yeah, I'm a big fan of community participation. Community stakeholders. I wouldn't say that I'm anti token or that I'm anti governance. I think that it's very important to be very careful with governance. I think it's a tool to be wielded with caution because it gets to the fundamental security properties of the system that you're building. So with Uniswap, my approach has always been automation.
00:44:13.642 - 00:45:06.460, Speaker E: First, automate everything that can be automated. And then if there's anything that can't be automated, then maybe that's an area to look at putting in governance. And obviously there is like an efficiency component where will governance make it more efficient but less automated? And that's sort of its own trade off space. But I worry about kind of broad governance over things that don't necessarily need to have voting or governance on. Or if a group of people can vote to break something, then that's just something to be aware of. And maybe it's impossible to create that thing without that. But if it is, then if you can automate it, then people can rely on the system you've built to work more.
00:45:06.460 - 00:45:48.470, Speaker E: They can rely on it to kind of continue to function for as long as the smart contractor, as long as ethereum works. And I think that's like a very powerful thing. And it's just I'm hesitant to break that fundamental property where people know that they can always rely on it for sort of experimental governance. And I'm a huge fan of all the governance experiments, and I will say that of all the protocols in this call, uniswap is the one that's probably most suited towards automation. Like the Use case behind it. I think trading is more suited towards automation than something like a pooled lending thing. Where pooled lending, you have this broader systemic shared risk.
00:45:48.470 - 00:46:22.120, Speaker E: And for something like Uniswap, you have these separate liquidity pools and they all have their kind of their own risk to them, but it's not liquidity. Providers on one pair aren't going to share risk with ones on another pair. And so you have very clear stakeholders in each system that can almost make local decisions without needing this broader governance to it. So I will say that's not a shot at anything. I think that I love all the governance experiments going on, but I'm very cautious of governance in general and think people should be careful with it.
00:46:22.730 - 00:46:27.800, Speaker C: Would you ever consider issuing a Unisoft token? And you said you weren't opposed to.
00:46:31.630 - 00:46:41.326, Speaker E: Know, if I thought that it filled a role that could not be done with automation, then for sure.
00:46:41.428 - 00:46:54.126, Speaker C: Interesting. Okay, so I really want to leave time for questions and I really wanted to talk about uma, and chainlink tokens, but I think we're running out of time.
00:46:54.228 - 00:46:55.122, Speaker D: Go to questions.
00:46:55.256 - 00:47:59.720, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we should go to questions. Oh my God, we had so many more topics that we didn't discuss, but we'll have to do another panel. So let's see what are some of the questions people in the audience, virtual audience, had? And okay, how would you weigh an account by believability so related to governance? I think people were talking about maybe alternative governance systems where know, people could vote according to maybe the reputation, rather know the amount of tokens they hold. I think okay, they were directing this question at Stani, so maybe Stani can start and if anyone wants to add to his answer, go ahead.
00:48:00.570 - 00:48:44.834, Speaker A: Yeah. Alternative to tokens or different model? I think the governance really it depends what you're governing. I mean, if you don't need a token to govern, I definitely agree. I rather rely on math if I could. Basically Hayden said and also I think what Calvin said about kind of like organizing societies better, that's also very key part. You're probably not always governing different kinds of monetary policies, but you might actually want to just organize things better. And I think what Dows are doing very well.
00:48:44.834 - 00:49:49.820, Speaker A: I mean, they are organizations and kind of like you're able to create a global organization and just basically organize and basically community in a more efficient way or more like a transparent way. So I think in terms of alternatives, many of the kind of differences I see is how companies are governed. For example, I think the difference between, let's say, a token based governance or how DCs are governing their investments, there isn't that many difference. Every kind of like investment, whether it's social capital investment, monetary investment, or just basically work investment, there's always governance in place. It just happens in different ways. And I think it really depends on what you are particularly governing. I think, as we heard here, everything is so early, it's very difficult to say anything.
00:49:49.820 - 00:50:17.890, Speaker A: What will be the exact correct model to DeFi protocols? And I think what's the coolest part? Like, everyone is having their own kind of flavor of governance. And it's kind of like everyone is having their own experimentation and basically time will tell what will fit everything. And I think that's also kind of like the same thing with Yuma and their future governance model. I mean, everything has a flavor.
00:50:18.310 - 00:51:21.106, Speaker D: Yes, Danny, I actually wanted to hop in there and kind of riff on that idea for a second and talk about governance in traditional corporations too, because you're right, governance exists. So, traditional corporation, we have shareholders who elect a board of directors, who elect a CEO to make all these decisions in this company. And if you think about something like Jeff Bezos at Amazon, right, you can't ask the shareholders to make all the decisions Jeff is making running this giant trillion dollar company. But it wouldn't even be conceptually possible or technologically possible to put to a shareholder vote every decision Jeff is making. But what's so cool and interesting about this space we're in is that we're designing more simple protocols. So sort of Hayden's point, automating a bunch of things and then having a relatively limited set of decisions that we actually don't need to entrust to a CEO to make. We actually have a technological system to ask token holders to make those decisions.
00:51:21.106 - 00:51:39.820, Speaker D: So it's almost like designing a company where you don't have a board of directors, you don't have a CEO, you have the shareholders directly making the decisions of the company or the now protocol for you. And I think that's just a really cool concept, a really cool thing to experiment with. That's kind of fun.
00:51:40.370 - 00:51:57.140, Speaker C: Yeah. No, super interesting. Okay, so another question people have is how realistic is it to use Flash loan bots for average users? So, Hayden, since Uniswap has been pushing this forward, what do you think?
00:51:58.230 - 00:53:07.640, Speaker E: It kind of depends on what you mean by average user. I think of the biggest users of Uniswap are the most important users as like the developers building on top of it. And in that sense, I think definitely most solidity developers kind of capable of creating smart contracts and capable of building on top of these protocols and creating composable applications should be capable of using flash loans and flash swaps and the like to use all these kind of use cases like the ones that Stani was mentioning earlier. If they're talking about running an off chain Arbitrage bot that uses flash loans to lower its capital requirements and not require any upfront capital, I do think know that is going to require some level of technical sophistication but less capital. So you will still need to run kind of like off chain botting systems. You always need to be kind of somewhat technological, but at least there will be like a lower you won't necessarily need to hold all the tokens that you would otherwise need to hold to participate in the Arbitrage, but yeah.
00:53:09.870 - 00:53:10.234, Speaker F: One.
00:53:10.272 - 00:53:36.980, Speaker A: Shield for project called Photocombo. So they basically try to create no code DeFi building blocks for basically users that aren't developers. Really interesting to see what happens. You can basically combine taking a flash loan and making Arbitrage, but it's of course interesting to see where this thing goes. But I'm very excited about all no code stuff.
00:53:38.550 - 00:54:02.890, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm excited about the no code movement since I can't code and I really like DeFi. All right. Okay, so let's see. Oh, there's one more question and then we'll have to wrap up. Someone is asking, can I create a token on, uma, using chainlink random number oracle and trade it on Uniswap? So who can answer that one?
00:54:03.040 - 00:54:23.274, Speaker D: I mean, I'd have to ask what that exactly would be if the idea here is that you create a token that at some expiry date in the future has some random value. So it's like a bet on some randomness. That's kind of crazy, but could you do that? Yeah. Can you trade it on uniswap?
00:54:23.322 - 00:54:23.582, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:54:23.636 - 00:54:31.550, Speaker D: I have no idea how anyone would price a token today that has some random value at some point in the future. That's weird.
00:54:31.630 - 00:54:34.370, Speaker E: Probably at the average value of the random number generator.
00:54:35.110 - 00:54:42.118, Speaker F: Maybe some kind of gaming based NFT something like this, like a card or something like this. I can't think.
00:54:42.284 - 00:54:52.860, Speaker D: Yeah, but I guess the meta answer here is like, hey, this is a hackathon, you guys can build whatever you want. And it's pretty wild what you can dream up.
00:54:53.390 - 00:55:54.430, Speaker C: Okay, so that maybe goes in the category of really weird things that maybe we'll see come out of this. So I don't know, buying this token would be like betting on chance, I guess, like randomness, which is pretty cool. All right. Okay, so we have a couple more minutes. I don't know if I'm pushing it, but there's one question that I really wanted to talk about and there aren't any audience questions. So just to ask you quickly about the connection between traditional finance and DeFi, I'm just really interested to hear how you guys think. What will happen in the future if DeFi and TradFi will work together if DeFi set out to replace it, if traditional finance has a chance at building competing protocols.
00:55:54.430 - 00:56:06.240, Speaker C: Who wants to answer this one? And I don't think we have time for everyone to go for it, but who really wants to go?
00:56:08.290 - 00:56:09.710, Speaker E: Traditional finance.
00:56:13.110 - 00:57:06.638, Speaker F: Thank you very much. Very quickly on my side, I still think that here it's really, again, an example of options, right? And I do think that it's very probable that the two systems will work fine in parallel for a long time still, because, again, people won't be forced to adopt either, right? It will be about options. I think a lot of people are very comfy being in this traditional financial system that they have today, and that basically the alternative will talk to a lot more people as we start going towards the path where you have negative interest rates, you have basically a lot of stuff which will attract investors to the DeFi world. And, yeah, I do think that's also a point for Oracles where basically, since you have these parallel systems running for still a very long time, you'll still always need a bridge between these two kind of words to communicate with each other. Thank you.
00:57:06.744 - 00:57:33.534, Speaker C: Yeah. Also think DeFi for now can definitely provide a good option, a good alternative for those dissolutions with traditional finance, or just not getting enough yield on their savings. All right, I think we'll have to wrap it up, unfortunately. This has been such a great talk. I have so many more questions to ask you all. But, yeah, we'll have to leave it for the next time. Thank you so much.
00:57:33.534 - 00:57:36.800, Speaker C: And thank you, Hag Money, for putting this together.
00:57:39.170 - 00:57:40.350, Speaker A: Thanks, Cammy.
00:57:43.330 - 00:58:24.686, Speaker B: And just in terms of quick closing, we had over 50 people join from a little bit over 20 countries attending this past hour. So thank you so much for everybody who took out the time during their mornings or late nights to hear everybody chat. And with that, just quick notes on to all the hackers that we still have your check ins for this week, they'll start today. So if you haven't gone back to us on Discord, please do. And for everybody who's looking to get feedback on their project for this week, that feedback session will happen exactly 24 hours from now. So 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.
00:58:24.686 - 00:58:44.890, Speaker B: So that's 21 hours from now. I am in a different time zone. And you get to chat with some of our mentors and our sponsors and also some of our judges and panelists to get feedback on what you're working on. So thanks again and we'll see you all on Discord. Bye.
