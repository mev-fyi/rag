00:00:00.810 - 00:00:37.218, Speaker A: All right, so we're dodge. It means interest in Klingonian. That's beside the point. Basically it's a time warping machine that allows you to get future money right now. So what I mean by that is that if you want your dai, for example, to earn interest, there's a lot of Star Trek memes in here. If you want your die to an interest, you have to put it on avi or compound and you have to wait for that interest to accrue. And you actually don't know how much you're going to get because the interest rate is variable.
00:00:37.218 - 00:01:20.150, Speaker A: So dodge solves both of those problems. You know exactly how much you're going to get, but not only that, you're also going to get it up front. So you're basically getting your cake and eating it too. So the use cases for this hopefully are obvious. It's a good way to avoid the opportunity risk with a lot of popular activities. In web3, if you're staking or escrow deferred payments, say for example, Alice wants to set up a Gitcoin bounty for Bob, she has to lock up her dai. But obviously if she's locking up her dai, she can't earn interest on that dai, so she uses DAJ to get the interest upfront.
00:01:20.150 - 00:01:45.246, Speaker A: So kuba, you're going to show how it works. It's basically based on the new asset class, which are called future tokens. So future die, FDAI. The letter wasn't taken, so we took it. Nobody else can have it now, sorry. And maybe over to you.
00:01:45.348 - 00:02:38.894, Speaker B: Okay, so this part looks quite typical, like an uproar depression. So you can just select how much f you want to deposit, what's depositing period. You can see what are the current rates and you click on depositing. Where's the MetaMask? So right now we are waiting for the interest rate to be transferred from the future. What actually is happening behind the curtains? We take your deposit, we look for the best available option on the liquidity pools, we diversify the risk and we recalculate the interest rate and send it back to the user. So what you receive is a future token, in this case future s that is locked until a maturity date expressed here. Actually it's kind of a multi token, ERC, 1155.
00:02:38.894 - 00:03:32.510, Speaker B: And what can you do with that token? You can transfer it in space and in time. So what do you mean by transferring in time? You can decide to, let's say, okay, take part of your deposit and push it farther to the future and earn more interest or push it closer to the present. So we repay the interest that you already taken upfront. Let us try that and maybe let's show also how to transfer that in space because it's like a fully fungible token within the categories that we define. So you can send it to your friend, you can put it on stake on the different protocols, you can mix with other DeFi app and you can even swap future apps for future Dai if you are brave enough. So have you got MetaMask? Can you just copy?
00:03:56.170 - 00:04:15.430, Speaker A: So here for example, alice can put her FDAI or her F ETH in Gitcoin, and when Bob delivers the bounty, he'll get his FDAI and then can convert that for actual Dai at the maturity period. So if it's June, die. He gets it in June.
00:04:15.590 - 00:04:33.950, Speaker B: Okay, let me refresh, because you switch to a new account, welcome MetaMask, saving transferring space to another account.
00:04:34.400 - 00:05:01.090, Speaker A: And while that's going on, we're working on this as an actual product. So we've been developing also a nice user friendly front end that explains it. That you can get your future money up front with like nicer sliders that are hopefully going to win the UX People prize, we don't know. And that's it. Thank you.
