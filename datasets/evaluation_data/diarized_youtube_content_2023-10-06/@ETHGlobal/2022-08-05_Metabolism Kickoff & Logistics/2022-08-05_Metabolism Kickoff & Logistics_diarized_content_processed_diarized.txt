00:00:06.890 - 00:00:18.960, Speaker A: Hi there. It's me, no. Have you missed us? There's so many more of us now. And we have missed you. Where have you been?
00:00:19.490 - 00:00:39.162, Speaker B: So much has changed since the last time we saw each other. So many new things, so many new opportunities, so many ways to be. It's exciting, but also a little bit frightening because you are here. We're together. We want to play a game with you.
00:00:39.216 - 00:00:51.190, Speaker A: It'll be fun. Promised. Bring your friends. We invited all of ours. They are really looking forward to meet you. It's a very easy game. There's only one rule.
00:00:51.190 - 00:00:54.926, Speaker A: You do what you want, what you always dreamt of.
00:00:55.108 - 00:01:15.910, Speaker B: Do what hasn't been done before. Create what is missing. The best thing is that you get to do it with your friends, old ones and all the friends you might make while playing the game. No fear. Even if you feel you've already won the game because you played it. The only missing move is not to play. Are you excited?
00:01:16.250 - 00:01:21.880, Speaker A: We are so excited. Not only to play with you, but to see what you will come up with.
00:01:22.410 - 00:01:25.240, Speaker B: Let me create together.
00:01:28.410 - 00:01:28.822, Speaker C: Morning.
00:01:28.876 - 00:01:50.094, Speaker D: Good afternoon. Good evening, everybody. My name is Karthik, one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to metabolism. I want to quickly thank Yuri for that amazing piano performance. We just took so many requests from the audience. I just had a really amazing intro into getting started with what the next week is going to look like. So thank you so much, Yuri, for doing this thing.
00:01:50.094 - 00:02:20.278, Speaker D: We hope to bring you back. All right, so to everybody that's joining us for the first time, we're doing all of this today on Eatglobal TV. This is the platform we'll be using for the rest of this summit as well as this hackathon. So for all the talks that are going to happen for the rest of today, you can ask any questions in the chat. You can sign in and talk to everybody, including us and the speakers and anything that you want to know. We can relay those questions and comments back to everybody on the live stream.
00:02:20.374 - 00:02:23.066, Speaker C: Also, for everybody that signs in, we.
00:02:23.088 - 00:02:49.620, Speaker D: Will be giving NFT COAPS to you for participation. So thank you so much and excited to get this going. So this event is brought to you by ETH Global. And for those of you who don't know, ETH Global is an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the web three ecosystem. And we do this primarily by running hackathons and summits. And this week is no different.
00:02:50.070 - 00:02:52.930, Speaker C: So want to first quickly talk about.
00:02:53.000 - 00:03:15.766, Speaker D: What we have planned for the next six days in terms of summits. There's going to be two summits. Today is the Zora Technical summit. We're going to be talking about a lot of things around what's happening in the Zora ecosystem. As well as how you can enhance all of your NFT experiences. And then we have a creative Summit on Tuesday. So next Tuesday, five days from now, and we'll be talking about all the amazing things that are happening in the rest of this broader ecosystem.
00:03:15.766 - 00:03:50.402, Speaker D: So stay tuned for all of that shortly after this. But first, the next 25 minutes are about what is happening with the metabolism hackathon. So the hackathon is off to an amazing start. We have over 380 hackers from 61 different countries participating in this event and they're spanning over 16 time zones. So we're going to be talking and interacting with so many people from so many parts of the world. We kind of put everybody on a map to see where they're all joining from. And it's still incredible to see so many countries, continents and regions represented.
00:03:50.402 - 00:03:51.926, Speaker D: And we can't wait to welcome and.
00:03:51.948 - 00:03:53.254, Speaker C: Talk to all of you.
00:03:53.452 - 00:04:33.378, Speaker D: Not only that, we also have 28 ecosystem partners and 55 ecosystem mentors that are going to be here on Discord. All on the summits, on the chats, and doing workshops, talks, answering questions, and helping you succeed in accomplishing your projects for this Sunday deadline. And all in all, we have over $100,000 in prizes that are going to be given away as part of this hackathon. So I'm going to cover what all of that is about. But before that, I want to quickly thank some of our amazing partners that without their support, this event would not be possible. So of course, Zora is an amazing partner we've been working with. And I want to thank Zora for.
00:04:33.464 - 00:04:36.470, Speaker C: Making this event come to life.
00:04:36.620 - 00:05:18.082, Speaker D: On top of that, I want to thank live Here NFT Storage Polygon and Lit Protocol and then Spin Amp Artiva juicebox Refraction make Fun African NFT community sound obsessed developer dow and Noom. I also want to thank Zines Boars, epass mutual love felt sign heat tech. She said. So friends with benefits and Star union and Mochi float alta anchor and artpeggy labs. So thank you so much to our amazing partners and we can't wait for all of you to see what comes out of this and have so many incredible projects use all of the work that you've been doing and building upon. So I want to cover a lot.
00:05:18.136 - 00:05:21.554, Speaker C: About what this weekend and the next.
00:05:21.592 - 00:05:23.300, Speaker D: Few days are going to be about.
00:05:24.470 - 00:05:26.286, Speaker C: The goal here is to talk about logistics.
00:05:26.318 - 00:05:34.930, Speaker D: I want to talk about anywhere from team formation, how you can get help, all the prizes, all the talks and workshops, judging and submission, how that's going to work, and of course, we're going to then jump right into the summit.
00:05:35.010 - 00:05:38.534, Speaker C: Which should be beginning right after this in 20 minutes.
00:05:38.732 - 00:05:44.330, Speaker D: So the first and the most important piece here is communication. Everything that we're going to be doing.
00:05:44.400 - 00:05:54.266, Speaker C: As part of this hackathon is going to be on Discord for all of you that have been confirmed as a hacker.
00:05:54.298 - 00:06:20.422, Speaker D: From your dashboard you will be able to connect your discord and you'll be seeing this discord metabolism header on your sidebar. So please make sure that you're able to see all these channels that are in the screenshot because that is controlled by our internal dashboard that gives you access based on what your role is at the event, whether you're a sponsor or a hacker or a mentor or any of the partners. So everything that we're doing is only open to the hackathon participants, which means.
00:06:20.476 - 00:06:23.126, Speaker C: That only people who are in one.
00:06:23.148 - 00:06:42.240, Speaker D: Of those 380 to 400 group are going to be able to chat. So you can talk to everybody there, you can talk to all of our partners, you can learn more about any of the prizes and ask questions if you're stuck on using specific APIs and SDKs. And that's also where you can get direct help. So if you have any questions, you can ask any of the mentors in the mentorship and help channel.
00:06:43.970 - 00:06:45.914, Speaker C: On top of that, we're also sharing.
00:06:45.962 - 00:07:36.720, Speaker D: And sending out calendar invites for talks and workshops. So you can be informed of some key dates like submission deadline or one of some of the summits in the kickoff and the finale are starting, where we're going to be talking about everything that comes out of this event. On top of all that, everything that is going to happen over the course of this event is going to be published on the website, which means that anytime you go to the website, what you see there will be the source of truth. So all talks, times, workshops, speakers, everything that's going to be happening will be relayed on the event website and really want this thing to be asynchronous. There's 61 countries already participating at this event and we really understand that not everybody is available at the same time to do all these things. So everything is designed to be discord first and recorded. And for a quick reminder, the website is metabolism epglobal.com.
00:07:36.720 - 00:07:52.260, Speaker D: So let's get into how the hackathon itself works. So officially the hackathon begins now, which means you can start working on your projects now and you can work on your projects with up to five members in a team.
00:07:52.950 - 00:07:56.114, Speaker C: You have the next few days to hack.
00:07:56.162 - 00:08:25.130, Speaker D: So this gives you until Sunday and the submission deadline is 03:00 p.m. Eastern on August 7. So quick note on how everything is structured on the team. You can have up to five members, but it's not required for you to have a team. Which means that if you are interested in working on something on your own or you are just using this as an opportunity to get better at something that is totally okay, you are more than welcome to submit individually and participate.
00:08:25.210 - 00:08:26.430, Speaker C: At your own pace.
00:08:27.410 - 00:08:37.420, Speaker D: We'll also keep the rules and the criteria for the event simple. Everything that we're going to be doing.
00:08:37.950 - 00:08:41.238, Speaker C: From the submission standpoint and what you're.
00:08:41.254 - 00:09:13.400, Speaker D: Going to be working on as a project is and should be done from scratch. Which means you cannot build on a preexisting personal project and you cannot continue adding features to something you have done before or submit something that you did not start as of today. This is meant to be a place for us to keep everything fair and we want to really make sure that everybody that's participating in submitting something has been part of the exact same rules, which is starting today and ending on Sunday. On top of all of that.
00:09:15.690 - 00:09:16.150, Speaker C: Every.
00:09:16.220 - 00:09:51.114, Speaker D: Submission must use something in the Zora ecosystem or the APIs or the SDKs or the Craft API to be eligible to compete and win in the projects or win any prizes. So please make sure that you are meeting those two requirements. And on top of all of those things, only RSVP hackers are eligible to win the prizes. Which means that if you are working on a team and your team members are not listed under the team section on your dashboard and they are not confirmed an RSVP at submission time and you win a prize.
00:09:51.162 - 00:09:53.338, Speaker C: We will only be honoring the delivery.
00:09:53.354 - 00:10:03.234, Speaker D: Of prizes to the members that were listed on the team and not anybody else that was officially not registered. So if you still have a friend or team member that is outstanding or has an RSVP from their dashboard, please.
00:10:03.272 - 00:10:06.398, Speaker C: Make sure that they are confirmed and.
00:10:06.424 - 00:10:23.558, Speaker D: Ready to attend by end of today. Of course, this means there's also going to be a couple of edge cases and we're more than welcome to help out and answer any of those questions or clarify certain things. So if you have any questions, please reach out to us on discord or email and ping anyone on the Global Team and we'll be happy to clarify.
00:10:23.654 - 00:10:29.562, Speaker C: Anything that you have they'd like to know. Next up is judging.
00:10:29.626 - 00:11:00.054, Speaker D: So this is the most critical piece on how everything is structured. So judging begins after submissions end. Submissions are going to be due on Sunday at 03:00 P.m. Eastern. So Sunday, August 7. It gives you a few more days to kind of work on everything. And the way everything is structured is that at submission time, when you submit and finish filling out all the fields that you need to specify whether what you're building, screenshots, prizes and everything else, those submissions will be locked in.
00:11:00.054 - 00:11:30.498, Speaker D: And everything that you submit at that deadline will be used to evaluate everything from our partners and for any of the prizes. Then the next day is when judging officially begins. Starts on Monday, the Eigth and judging is going to be split into two streams. One of them is the main judging if you are trying to be a finalist for this hackathon. And then one of them is the Sponsor prize judging, which is going to be Asynchronous and Run. Also in parallel. For the main judging, it's going to.
00:11:30.504 - 00:11:34.626, Speaker C: Be a live call where you as.
00:11:34.648 - 00:11:50.934, Speaker D: A team are going to come on and present your projects to our judges and they're going to come on and ask questions and give feedback and do that directly synchronously on a zoom call in parallel. If you are trying to win a.
00:11:50.972 - 00:11:53.734, Speaker C: Prize from any of our partners, your.
00:11:53.772 - 00:11:57.014, Speaker D: Project will be given to them to look at and evaluate.
00:11:57.062 - 00:12:00.346, Speaker C: And they'll be going through all of.
00:12:00.368 - 00:12:20.382, Speaker D: Your details for the prize and whether it's your demo or your video or anything that you submit asynchronously and if and only if they have any questions, they'll be reaching out to you directly to clarify or answer and go deeper into anything they'd like to know. From there, they'll be announcing and picking who the winners are. And all of that comes together on.
00:12:20.436 - 00:12:23.338, Speaker C: Wednesday, which is the finale where we're.
00:12:23.354 - 00:12:42.760, Speaker D: Going to be talking about who won what prizes and in the middle of that is Tuesday, which is going to be our creative summit. So while we kind of compute everything, you get to enjoy some incredible speakers talking about everything that they're excited about. So the main judging is structured as follows you will have four minutes to demo what you built.
00:12:43.210 - 00:12:44.822, Speaker C: This will be up to four minutes.
00:12:44.876 - 00:13:26.146, Speaker D: Which is a max limit, but you can also obviously do something that's less than a four minute demo. And to simplify this process for everybody and make it really easy for us to review everything and make sure there are no technical difficulties. Every submission will be required to do a every team will be required to do a video submission, which means you're recording an up to four minute video of what you built, which is a live demo introduction to who you are, what you built, and why. And that's what you upload on Sunday. Having kind of gone through this thing a handful of times, we really recommend that you do not leave this thing till last minute because you will run into situations where you can't fit everything that you want to show off in four minutes. So please make sure you have at least 2 hours blocked to be able.
00:13:26.168 - 00:13:28.854, Speaker C: To work on the submission video as.
00:13:28.892 - 00:13:52.270, Speaker D: Well as all the fields that you to fill out on describing what you did and how it works. So please, only just the last minute and all that happens through your dashboard. Which means that right now you see the ability to create and update your project, but you'll then see a proper submission flow that lets you specify all these things and upload that video and talk about all the prizes that you would like to qualify for and all the details that are needed accordingly.
00:13:54.050 - 00:13:56.414, Speaker C: And of course, the next piece is.
00:13:56.452 - 00:13:59.102, Speaker D: What if I'm new to all of this? This is the most kind of common.
00:13:59.156 - 00:14:02.898, Speaker C: Question we've gotten and we want to.
00:14:02.904 - 00:14:09.874, Speaker D: Make sure that this event is beginner friendly. And the way we have structured this.
00:14:09.912 - 00:14:12.146, Speaker C: Is that we are making sure that.
00:14:12.168 - 00:14:45.326, Speaker D: We have content structured for every type of audience and skill set. So there's going to be a lot of work being done and content being ready for beginners, intermediate and experts. And obviously there's a lot of talks, panels and workshops and also interactive sessions so you can meet other members for the hackathon and go anywhere from form teams to share ideas. We're also obviously doing a summary right after this thing that goes deeper into how Zora Protocol works and all that information is also going to be listed on the Metabolism Info Center. But also if you can't attend all these things, don't worry, everything is recorded as well.
00:14:45.348 - 00:14:47.326, Speaker C: So as soon as it ends, it.
00:14:47.348 - 00:14:55.710, Speaker D: Will be immediately available on YouTube and you can find out all these things onglobal.
00:14:58.310 - 00:14:59.954, Speaker C: And to find out what's going on.
00:14:59.992 - 00:15:12.166, Speaker D: Whether it's the submission deadlines or the speakers or the talks or any workshops, you can head over to Metabolism eigthglobal.com to find the latest. And of course, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask them on the chat and I'd be more.
00:15:12.188 - 00:15:15.766, Speaker C: Than happy to answer them here live.
00:15:15.868 - 00:15:41.034, Speaker D: But of course, the second this live stream ends, you can watch this video again or if you are on Neatglobal TV right now, you can just hover over the video and drag it back and watch the replay on demand. All right, let's talk about prizes. So there's a lot of amazing prizes that are being given out and I want to spend most of the time on talking about all the things that you can win in the Zora ecosystem.
00:15:41.162 - 00:15:49.006, Speaker C: So Zora is going to be giving away five E in four of these categories.
00:15:49.118 - 00:16:01.554, Speaker D: So the first category is the best use of Zora Protocol and API. The second one is going to be on the best integrations of projects that look into on chain music ecosystems. There's also a lot of prizes to be won or a lot of ETH.
00:16:01.602 - 00:16:06.418, Speaker C: To be won for integrations and projects tackling dow tooling.
00:16:06.514 - 00:16:46.994, Speaker D: And we also want to make sure this attracts developers equally as well as creatives. And if you have interesting NFT experiments, you are also able to qualify for specifically winning a lot of ETH in that category. So these are the four places where you can qualify to win sort of prizes. On top of all that, we have of course a few ecosystem partners. So Polygon will be giving $10,000 in prizes for best integrations that also interact with the Polygon ecosystem and to make all of your lives simpler in terms of uploading and managing your NFTs. NFT Storage is also giving 7.5K in prizes to use the NFT storage platform and we have Lit Protocol live.
00:16:46.994 - 00:17:43.286, Speaker D: Peter, if you are interested in building things around permissioning and live streaming, you can also win five k each from them in prizes. And I won't go into the details of all of these things here, but to find out specifics about what these prizes are, the documentation to learn about links on what it means to use them, get sample code, all these things are available on metabolism, ethcopa.com, prizes. And of course, as we end this and run into or get ready for our summit, I want to make sure that you are pacing yourself as part of this event. I know four days is not a lot of time to kind of spend all the time working and building your projects, but we really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you. We really want you to have fun. This is very much about experimentation and learning and largely just being able to meet really incredible, passionate people who also are interested in the same things as you.
00:17:43.286 - 00:18:20.882, Speaker D: So please take your time and make sure that you are using this as an opportunity to really understand what's happening. Learn more about what Zora is doing, and you are meeting people with different ideas and interesting backgrounds and interesting stories and finding a way to collaborate with them to work on something that all of you can be excited about. So that concludes all of our logistics. Want to wish all of you happy hacking. We'll see all of you on Discord and of course if you have any questions, we can happily answer them here or on Discord. So thanks again to the hackers and with this we are ready to start our incredible summit. So the next few hours are jampacked with a lot of technical content.
00:18:20.882 - 00:18:25.346, Speaker D: So I'm going to quickly jump into what is going on with the rest of the day.
00:18:25.448 - 00:18:27.586, Speaker C: So before we introduce our first speaker.
00:18:27.618 - 00:19:00.746, Speaker D: I want to just quickly give an overview of the schedule. So we're going to have six amazing talks. We're going to kick off today with bringing on Jacob from Zora, talking about the Zora playbook and learning a little bit more about hyperstructures. We're going to have Max who's going to be talking about how you actually build with Zora directly as a developer. It will be more of an interactive and technical workshop. Then Ian is going to talk about Zora's create tools and how you can leverage all that work that they've been doing. Then we're going to have Jen talk about custom interface for ERC 721 drop extension and using that to build for hundred profit.
00:19:00.746 - 00:19:17.734, Speaker D: And then Isabella is going to be bringing talking about Zora's API. It's something that will simplify your life so much, especially as you are looking to explore the projects this week. And then Dan is going to talk about how do you actually build great user experiences and how you can leverage some of these best practices to really.
00:19:17.772 - 00:19:21.720, Speaker C: Make sure that your hack submission is perfect.
00:19:22.170 - 00:19:26.290, Speaker D: So, without further ado, I'd like to start a little bit early and bring on jacob.
