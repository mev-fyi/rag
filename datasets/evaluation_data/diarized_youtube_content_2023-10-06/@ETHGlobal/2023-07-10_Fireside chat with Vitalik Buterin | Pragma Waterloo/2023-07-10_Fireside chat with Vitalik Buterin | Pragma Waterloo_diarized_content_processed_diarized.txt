00:00:07.130 - 00:00:23.898, Speaker A: So for our very first keynote for Fireside Chat for today, I want to bring on Vitalik, the co founder of Ethereum and Bitcoin magazine, to tell you more. And we're going to have a lot of discussions around how things have changed and some things that have not changed.
00:00:23.994 - 00:00:26.438, Speaker B: So welcome. Blah, blah. Is it working?
00:00:26.524 - 00:00:27.142, Speaker A: I think so.
00:00:27.196 - 00:00:31.126, Speaker B: Okay, good. Mics often don't work. You have to check.
00:00:31.308 - 00:01:13.250, Speaker A: That is actually true. I don't know if people caught that, but that happened with me as soon as I started talking on stage. It's working. All right, well, there's a lot of things I want to talk to you today about and for the audience, we're going to shape this conversation in three parts. We're going to reflect on how things kind of started and summarize if things are meeting expectation, we're going to talk about what's next, which is a lot of how do we actually still solve some hard problems that we have in this space, especially around scaling. And then the third category is just various. There's a lot of things I'm curious about now I want to not always talk about ethereum and we'll kind of go into some of those things too.
00:01:13.250 - 00:01:23.720, Speaker A: And let's get started. So I'll keep it easy for the very first question and let's go talk about scaling directly. So what even is a roll up?
00:01:24.330 - 00:02:26.140, Speaker B: Okay, so Asia roll up is what we call a layer two protocol that sits on top of ethereum. And what it does is it basically creates this environment within which you can do all of the same things that you can do inside of ethereum, except all of the computation and most of the data is put off chain. But at the same time, the roll up benefits from being protected by the security of ethereum. So you have a system which uses ethereum only a small amount just as a space to put proofs and as a space to put a small portion of data that's actually needed to verify the proofs and that's needed to be able to join the roll up. But otherwise you basically have an ethereum like environment where everything else is being done off chain. And the benefit of this is that it can be much cheaper than what we call the ethereum layer one while being basically just as secure at the same time.
00:02:27.230 - 00:02:43.230, Speaker A: That was a good intro. Let's dig in a bit deeper. There's a lot of chatter around technicalities, around what defines a roll up. You said a lot of things are off chain and you kind of keep proofs there. So how do you personally define the integrity of what is considered valuable data?
00:02:43.380 - 00:03:41.442, Speaker B: Okay, so this is, I guess, a good time to go into kind of the taxonomy of everything that's not L, one that claims to be part of Ethereum land, whether for marketing reasons or otherwise. Okay, so first you have roll ups, right? The key property of a roll up is that even if all of the existing actors in the roll up disappear, any new actors can come in and join and they can basically keep going. Even if all of the existing actors, except for you as a user inside the roll up, become dishonest, you can still do something that basically, possibly with your action or possibly by default, they're not going to be able to win. They're not going to be able to steal your money. They're not going to be able to freeze your money. Basically, you can as an individual can force the roll up to still continue acting correctly and continue working the way that it's supposed to work.
00:03:41.496 - 00:03:44.174, Speaker A: And this statement applies for both ZK roll ups and optimistic.
00:03:44.222 - 00:04:24.530, Speaker B: And optimistic. Optimistic requires you, you as that one good user, to submit a fraud proof in a ZK roll up. They're not able to submit invalid stuff in the first place because they can't submit a valid proof. So roll ups and in order to do this, roll ups have to put not just the proofs, but also some amount of data on chain, some amount of data per transaction. And the reason they have to do this is so that if all of the existing actors disappear, a new actor who wants to join the roll up and start participating, they can actually kind of sync the state of the roll up. They can actually understand what happened before, what are the balances that people have so that they actually have the information to build things on top and keep going. So roll ups are the gold standard.
00:04:24.530 - 00:05:07.182, Speaker B: Now, within roll ups there is this stage classification between stage zero, stage one and stage two. And actually l two beat is like if you go to L twobeat.com, they have a classification for this. There are a couple of details that I'm still talking about them with. I personally think the threshold for the upgrade council should be or for the emergency council should be much higher than it currently is. But otherwise it's still a very good resource. The short definition of the three stages is that stage two is like a fully secured roll up that has all of the properties that I just said.
00:05:07.182 - 00:05:36.326, Speaker B: On the other side, a stage zero roll up is just a thing that is on the path to being a roll up and that has some very basic stuff. There is open source software that lets you follow along the chain and track what's going on. It calls itself a roll up. It has basic levels of censorship, resistance. It's like something that's on the path to being a full roll up. But there's still a lot of pieces that have not been developed, but some pieces that are do side chains fit that definition or side chains do not.
00:05:36.348 - 00:05:36.534, Speaker C: Right?
00:05:36.572 - 00:06:08.142, Speaker B: So for something to be a stage zero roll up, it has to have an intent to be a roll, but it has to already have the data on chain. Stage one is like this halfway house where basically you can think of it as the zero knowledge proof or the fraud proof system has half the votes and there is this Security Council that has the other half of the votes. And so if there's like a large supermajority on the Security Council, then they can overturn what the fraud proof system says. And the purpose of this is to be some training wheels in case the fraud proof system still has some bugs.
00:06:08.206 - 00:06:08.674, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:08.792 - 00:06:17.602, Speaker B: But otherwise it's basically functioning. It is a roll up. You just don't trust the fraud proof or zero knowledge group system quite enough yet.
00:06:17.656 - 00:06:18.066, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:18.168 - 00:06:41.262, Speaker B: And so the requirements are Security Council has to have a minimum of eight participants. I mean, my view is that the threshold should be at least three quarters. But this is one of those things that's being debated. The reason why 50% is not enough right, is because if you have 50%, then basically the majority of this council can just push the outcome whatever way it wants and there's no value in actually having a proof system.
00:06:41.316 - 00:06:41.534, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:41.572 - 00:07:46.980, Speaker B: So we're trying to sort of want supermajority in general, push significantly higher on that. And then, yeah, as I mentioned, LTB is doing a good job of kind of really organizing and making it available, which roll ups have which properties. So I personally don't have to go and yell that out and occasionally make mistakes. And occasionally get yelled at people for making mistakes. And then stage one, basically you can have a Security Council needs to have some very high thresholds, needs to include many participants from outside of the organization that's running the thing. And it's kind of this intermediate stage that actually Arbitrum is at according to the definitions that we've kind of clarified a lot over the last month or so. And polygon is almost there technologically they're there with practically they just have to flip some switches, turn off some censorship capabilities and override checks, right? Exactly.
00:07:46.980 - 00:08:03.654, Speaker B: We're already in a stage one roll up world. And then stage two basically says we get rid of this Security Council or the Security Council is allowed to exist, but it's only allowed to do things if the code disagrees with itself.
00:08:03.852 - 00:08:04.518, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:08:04.604 - 00:08:04.854, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:04.892 - 00:08:06.994, Speaker A: So the actual in case of emergency.
00:08:07.122 - 00:08:16.294, Speaker B: Exactly. So you do fully trust the code, but if you have two implementations of the code and they disagree with each other, then you know that there is a bug and you could have humans at Durbian.
00:08:16.342 - 00:08:16.794, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:16.912 - 00:08:26.880, Speaker B: But otherwise you actually get to something that involves fully trusting the code. And I think we're going to get to stage two slowly over the next couple of years.
00:08:27.570 - 00:08:29.306, Speaker A: Next couple of years slowly?
00:08:29.498 - 00:08:30.094, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:30.212 - 00:08:33.610, Speaker A: Is that a check on things being finally safe enough in Ga?
00:08:33.690 - 00:09:13.674, Speaker B: Exactly, it's a check where you're finally safe enough that you're willing to really throw out the keys and fully interest the code. Awesome. Yeah. So that's stage two. Now that's roll ups, right? Then there's validiums. A Validium is a system where you have Zka, you have Snarks for validation, you have all those properties, but the data is off chain, the data is somewhere else. And the properties that these systems have is that if the people holding the data turn out or if the people running the system in general turn out to be evil, they cannot steal your money because they cannot prove something, a state that did not actually happen because the ZK Stark stopped them from doing that.
00:09:13.674 - 00:09:46.262, Speaker B: But what they can do is they can freeze everyone's money, right? Because what they can do is they can just make a block and they can stop publishing stuff so they can freeze your money, they cannot steal your money. So that's this kind of like hybrid model that ZK Validiums provide. And I think polygon one or two days ago made this interesting announcement where they said that they want the current polygon chain. So they have two chains, right? They have polygon ZK EVM, which is a ZK rollup. And then they have the existing polygon where most of the existing applications are on. And they made an announcement they want to convert that into a Validium over time.
00:09:46.316 - 00:09:46.630, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:46.700 - 00:09:50.646, Speaker B: And as we've seen, they do have the technology to do that.
00:09:50.668 - 00:09:50.854, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:50.892 - 00:10:07.550, Speaker B: So that's exciting. And then above a voldium you have various kinds of side chains and things that are run by multisigs and all of that stuff and those are definitely much less secure and so I recommend them for very low valuable applications only, but they do exist.
00:10:08.530 - 00:10:47.260, Speaker A: Amazing. I think all of this actually ends up setting the stage for some of the scaling related conversations we're going to have later in this talk. Let's kind of zoom out and go back in time. Ethereum is nearing actually or maybe just hit ten years from the initial conception to where we are now, it seems, doesn't seem like ten years have passed. And my question, kind of to you is, walk us kind of down memory lane and tell us about the optimism you had back in the day when you kind of thought about this as a project and what you thought the hopes and dreams were. The world computer, kind of from ten years ago to where we are now. How did things turn out and what's kind of some of the reflections you've got?
00:10:48.590 - 00:12:02.546, Speaker B: Yeah, I think ten years ago we just didn't know a lot about what Ethereum could be useful for. And there were definitely some specific applications that I mentioned in the white paper that seemed like it made a lot of sense. Just tokens exchanging between tokens dow, stablecoins dows, privacy preserving stuff, smart contracts for insurance, like all of this fun stuff. And then a lot of people have tried those things and I think over the last ten years the thinking has really become a lot less abstract and a lot more concrete. Like there is a lot more focus on specific categories of applications where we know that there is something interesting and really trying to take those and trying to remove all of the annoyances today that make them either not usable or not actually decentralized or both and really try to make those applications work in the best way that we can. Tokens are obviously one of them. The whole kind of ENS identity, reputation ecosystem is another one.
00:12:02.546 - 00:13:11.334, Speaker B: All of the zero knowledge proof stuff continuing to fine tune and optimize dows the hybrid applications that have some centralized and some decentralized components which I think realistically generally end up using zero knowledge proofs. So having much more focused work on getting those kinds of things to a stage where they can actually work, where they regular people can actually use them. Remember ten years ago we had a lot of these movements and subcultures that were really trying to get cryptocurrency adopted for payments and that was kind of big. Even in 2013 I remember visiting this region called the Bitcoin Keats in Berlin. It's the name that they had, they basically renamed Kroitzburg and they convinced about ten shops there like restaurants and other shops to start accepting bitcoin for payments and there was this really nice subculture around that I remember. Yeah, but then it died off over time because I think one of the big reasons is just the transaction fees made bitcoin no longer good for payments anymore.
00:13:11.382 - 00:13:15.098, Speaker A: Well, the confirmation time, the fees and then the appreciation made him not make it.
00:13:15.184 - 00:13:48.114, Speaker B: Exactly all of that stuff. And I think we in Ethereum know that for any of this stuff to be practical it has to be on layer twos. But there aren't good layer two payment systems, right? Like I have a wallet, you might have a wallet, but what if we have coins on different roll ups, right? Then one of us has to go fumble around with hop protocol or some other weird thing and we have to figure out this complicated process of bridging stuff and that's not the way any of this should work, right?
00:13:48.232 - 00:13:50.018, Speaker A: Like waiting in line to pay for your copy.
00:13:50.034 - 00:14:58.138, Speaker B: Yeah, like paying people should be a one button experience that confirms in 12 seconds that's the one thing that we did fix, like EAP 1559 and the merge together, they massively reduced users experienced confirmation times. For me, they reduced it from this weird thing that's between two minutes and an hour to just reliably being able to get stuff confirmed in 12 seconds, right? And that's I think super amazing. But even still, once you're talking about cross roll up then you want one click to be able to do all of the different steps of the operation, right? And we're not quite at that and it would be really amazing if we do. And I think the nice thing is that that kind of project is a project that's very hackathon friendly because it really is just combining existing systems that exist. Right. All you want we need is like, a wallet where you have an account on multiple L two S, and where if I'm on one L two and you're accepting on a different L two, then the system notices that, and the system routes the payments through one of these payments relay, like cross roll up relaying protocols instead.
00:14:58.224 - 00:14:58.666, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:58.768 - 00:15:31.110, Speaker B: And you need to have some kind of standardized QR code system so that if basically whatever information the recipient has about how they want to be paid, all of that gets scanned by the sender. And then the sender sees not just their address, but where they want to be paid, what kind of currencies they want to be paid in. And everything actually combines the different components in the ecosystem. It can actually resolve that. And this is the sort of thing that's totally implemented. It just has to be done and standardized and put into the wallets that already exist.
00:15:32.410 - 00:16:14.180, Speaker A: And on the other side, for merchants to actually make them easy for them to actually accept it without. It's an interesting thing, because ten years ago, or even like seven years ago, we could have hypothesized, this is how we want it to be, but you didn't have the existing tools. But just in the last three years, just USDC itself has become so prevalent and so widespread that you can actually have a notion of, okay, this is a dollar anywhere else, but it seems like we're still not there yet in terms of seeing this to full fruition. So those were the initial thinkings on kind of, what, ten years ago, ethereum would have been. What kind of is the answer now for what you think ethereum is now?
00:16:16.950 - 00:16:32.630, Speaker B: I think it's interesting to see kind of both ethereum and cryptocurrency in general. It's succeeded in some ways and failed at other ways. One of the ways in which it succeed is that significant portions of the population are already using it in lots of countries.
00:16:32.710 - 00:16:33.340, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:33.870 - 00:16:36.506, Speaker B: When I go to Argentina using it.
00:16:36.528 - 00:16:39.658, Speaker A: Or have both, okay.
00:16:39.744 - 00:16:46.186, Speaker B: Like when I go to Argentina, the rate at which I get noticed down the street is greater than in San Francisco.
00:16:46.298 - 00:16:46.960, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:50.050 - 00:17:21.226, Speaker B: Lots of people, they hold cryptocurrencies. There is a lot of places that accept it. There's an entire actually working economy with it. And then in a lot of these other countries, I've been told Nigeria is very similar. I've been told Turkey is very similar. And I'll be visiting actually Turkey for defconnect later in the year. There's lots of places where there's lots of very real need for this kind of stuff.
00:17:21.226 - 00:17:41.754, Speaker B: But you notice one particular thing, which is that when you go there and you see people accepting Mino crypto, they take it through, look, people just have Binance wallets. And there's a reason for this, right. One is that Binance has zero fees and Binance accounts are instant.
00:17:41.802 - 00:17:42.062, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:42.116 - 00:17:46.578, Speaker B: Like, they just practically solve UX issues that are prohibitive for a lot of people.
00:17:46.664 - 00:17:47.298, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:47.464 - 00:18:40.670, Speaker B: So I remember my last experience using Ethereum to pay someone for food at a coffee shop or for coffee, which for me means green tea, at a coffee shop in Buenos Aires. And I made a point of using my proper Ethereum wallet, and he had a Binance account. And my experience was that I sent the transaction, and then it took a couple of minutes for it to confirm, because even though by this time EAP 1559 existed, the particular wallet that I used had not yet upgraded to support EAP One Five Nine. And now it has. Right. But the confirmation took a couple of minutes. And then the other thing was that the fee was like, I think, somewhere between one dollars to $4.
00:18:40.670 - 00:18:42.318, Speaker B: I forget the exact amount, but it.
00:18:42.324 - 00:18:43.920, Speaker A: Was like, how much was the tea?
00:18:44.370 - 00:19:34.098, Speaker B: Well, four, I was paying for a group of friends. And so I think what actually happened is that we were supposed to pay somewhere around $15, but then when the payments was not working, I sent another payment from a different wallet, just in case. And then eventually both payments went through, and I'm like, okay, the guy deserves 100% tip. That's fine. Yeah. Basically, the fees were like, I think, maybe a quarter of the total payment, which is still kind of prohibitive. So I totally understand these people's desire to use Binance, and I'm appreciative of Binance and these other wallets for just making crypto available to these people in some form.
00:19:34.098 - 00:19:52.970, Speaker B: Yeah. But at the same time, this space is about decentralization, and we have to move forward, and we have to make actually decentralized ways of participating in this ecosystem usable for people. And to do that, we have to actually solve these problems.
00:19:53.040 - 00:19:53.274, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:53.312 - 00:20:23.300, Speaker B: And there's been a lot of tech work, but the next step is to actually do this last mile of making L2 S usable. Making L2 is a default for people making payments on L2 work. Making payments across L2 s work making ENS on L2 with actual Merkel branch verification. The default, making just all of these different pieces actually work together, right?
00:20:25.190 - 00:20:45.340, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I think one of the things that I had questions on was actually what's missing here? So we'll kind of COVID that too. But I think one point that you made is kind of how do we actually contrast convenience with decentralization? Before going to that, I'm actually curious to hear what does decentralization mean to you and why do you think it's important?
00:20:47.070 - 00:20:54.266, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think basically building systems where you can't get rug pulled. Right. That's kind of the and the thing.
00:20:54.288 - 00:21:01.230, Speaker A: That you just talked about for all those countries, like the one common pattern in all three of these places is that exactly trust in the government currency is not high.
00:21:01.300 - 00:21:45.998, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean there's like many kinds of rug pulling, right? Your currency can get devalued by three x, your PayPal accounts could get locked and your money frozen for 180 days without interest. You could get deplatformed off Twitter and have no recourse. You could have your email account locked and basically have no way to get it back. Unless you're like a super privileged person who knows someone who's one hop away from a top level employee at one of these companies. This is actually another one of those weird things. People often make this argument that oh, centralized stuff has good accounts recovery and is good in practice if you screw up, but it's surprising to what extent that's not true. Right.
00:21:45.998 - 00:22:33.850, Speaker B: I've personally had to go and use my contacts and help unlock people's accounts at these weird Silicon Valley companies and it's okay, fine, a few thousand people around the world have that level of privilege, but what about everyone else, right? I honestly believe that social recovery, as I've been chilling for the last five years, is a better and more reliable form of recovery than anything that these centralized people offer. Right. But the problem is that we actually have to build it and go make it available for people. So that's one of the things that's.
00:22:34.430 - 00:22:52.110, Speaker A: One common point that usually comes up when at least I'm having some of these conversations is like, well, most people are not getting banned in deep platform and only applies to a very small chunk of the population. How do you kind of contrast that as an argument? And why is that still not a good defense for people saying nothing has to be decentralized?
00:22:52.190 - 00:23:07.938, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think one of the things is that there's definitely some communities where that happens very rarely and then there's other communities where that sort of stuff just happens all the time. And it's just a part of I.
00:23:07.964 - 00:23:19.354, Speaker A: Mean, if you're in crypto as a company and you're using a platform specifically like MailChimp for emails, you just get insta deplatform and you have no other option.
00:23:19.392 - 00:24:02.540, Speaker B: And that's a very exactly. That sort of stuff I think happens to me, I think more than once this year. It's totally a thing. And then the other thing is just even if you personally are not the one getting targeted, like just like a lot of the time, like you and the, and the values that you care about are being protected by other people who are being, who are very vulnerable to this sort of thing. I think having a credibly neutral infrastructure that can't be easily turned against particular people or particular groups of people is just really important.
00:24:03.310 - 00:24:06.006, Speaker A: And that applies to non financial applications.
00:24:06.038 - 00:24:20.160, Speaker B: Equally exactly, it applies to both non financial applications and financial applications. It applies across the entire world. I think even more than it applies to wealthy countries, but I think it applies to some extent in wealthy countries too.
00:24:21.330 - 00:24:29.970, Speaker A: So you talked about social recovery and that you've been talking about it in five years. Well, it's 2023. Why haven't we seen that in masses?
00:24:31.030 - 00:24:38.786, Speaker B: So, for social recovery wallets in particular, there's a lot of UX challenges to getting them properly rolled out. Right. This is like very subtle.
00:24:38.818 - 00:24:38.966, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:38.988 - 00:24:43.318, Speaker B: So first, the reason why ERC, four three seven needs to exist, right?
00:24:43.404 - 00:24:46.194, Speaker A: Basically, which is a construction for LP.
00:24:46.242 - 00:24:55.274, Speaker B: Exactly. So the type of wallet that most people use today, it's called an EOA, an externally owned account. It's a wallet that is controlled by one private key.
00:24:55.312 - 00:24:55.418, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:55.424 - 00:25:03.370, Speaker B: So you have one private key, 132 byte number, and copying your twelve secret words. Exactly.
00:25:03.440 - 00:25:03.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:03.648 - 00:25:12.806, Speaker B: And this is like one number that if you lose it, your account goes bye bye. If someone else sees it, then they grab your assets and your assets go bye bye.
00:25:12.858 - 00:25:13.266, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:13.368 - 00:25:32.806, Speaker B: And it's like actually not very good security. And then I think people for the last five years have been like the dog in the meme, basically, say, mentioning hardware wallets and saying, this is fine, but then we hear scandals involving hardware wallets once every couple of years and.
00:25:32.908 - 00:25:36.418, Speaker A: Unanimously, everybody's affected with a single point of failure.
00:25:36.514 - 00:25:51.902, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I basically think the only sensible future that makes sense, especially when we're talking about something as serious as holding someone's identity in their life savings, is some kind of multisig solution that involves stuff that's not just controlled by you.
00:25:51.956 - 00:25:52.560, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:54.450 - 00:26:05.406, Speaker B: I personally have most of my money in a multi SIG wallet, and I would not trust it any other way. I would literally not trust a system where I had all of the keys.
00:26:05.598 - 00:26:07.570, Speaker A: This is a $5 wrench attack.
00:26:07.720 - 00:26:10.446, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. All kinds of attacks.
00:26:10.478 - 00:26:11.060, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:13.030 - 00:26:49.722, Speaker B: Okay. So the problem with smart contract wallets is that an EOA is just something that you can use by yourself, right? If you want to have multiple keys, then you need to have a smart contract to actually implement those rules. Now, if you have a smart contract implementing those rules, then your funds have to be stored in a smart contract. But then there's a problem. Who pays for gas in an Ethereum? Everything with the current Ethereum rules, a transaction has to start from an EOA and that EOA has to pay gas. Therefore, if you use a smart contract wallet, you need to have your money in your smart contract wallet. You also need to have some amount of money in your EOA to be able to pay the gas.
00:26:49.722 - 00:27:52.130, Speaker B: You have to have logic for constantly refreshing that EOA. You have to pay an extra 21,000 gas to verify the part of the transaction that just is going into the EOA and then separately pay for the logic of verifying the smart contract. Over here, it just gets very complicated. You need all of this extra weird stuff happening. And ERC 4337 is like trying to basically streamline all of that, reduce the gas cost of that as much as possible and make the experience of having a smart contract wallet basically the same as the experience of an EOA. And theoretically, it works. There's this thing called ERC 1271, right? Basically a lot of applications that like DFI apps, a lot of other kinds of apps, they depend on users being able to make signatures, right? So you sign not just transactions, you also sign messages off chain, right? And signing messages off chain is often valuable.
00:27:52.130 - 00:28:41.842, Speaker B: Like, Cowswap uses it, lots of applications use it. But the problem is that just the kind of signing that they use is EOA only, right? And what EAP 1271 does is it defines a way for smart contract wallets to be able to sign not just user operations, but also the word for kind of the equivalent of transactions, but also off chain messages. The problem is lots of DApps don't support ERC 1271, right? Actually, in my opinion, lots and lots of DApps are just doing a terrible job of being standards compliant. Lots of DApps are metamaskulinly, like de facto. You try to use them from inside of Brave or the status world or anything else, they just break. Like, come on, guys, like Shame, right? Lots of DApps. Don't support ERC 1271.
00:28:41.842 - 00:29:19.930, Speaker B: More shame, right? Some DApps even use checking that the code of an account is empty. So checking that an account is an EOA as a proof that this is something that's allowed to use it, right? Triple shame. There's just so much stuff within the application ecosystem that is just like totally not realizing what the smart contract reality is going to be. And this is one of the reasons why I've told a lot of other people that the remaining challenges are not technical challenges, they're social coordination challenges.
00:29:20.010 - 00:29:20.640, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:21.490 - 00:29:37.750, Speaker B: Zero knowledge proofs exist. Smart contract wallets exist. Formal verification exists, right? Like Zkevms exist. The main challenge at this point is just like getting all of the pieces fit together in ways so that it actually makes sense for people and it's actually usable by people.
00:29:37.900 - 00:29:42.886, Speaker A: So it's not specifically communicating that. It's more about actually in this place, standard compliance, at least.
00:29:42.908 - 00:30:13.040, Speaker B: So that standards compliance. I think we need more people somehow kicking all of in the butts, like all of these developers of applications that are not even trying to be standards compliant. That's another hackathon project, an equivalent for L two Beat, but like a website that kind of say the same, like names and shames applications that are not standards can fly it. Yeah.
00:30:14.450 - 00:30:29.718, Speaker A: One other kind of question I have is, well, it seems like we're obviously moving to a MultiChain world, right? How do you make this more consistent? Now when people have anywhere from multiple wallets to the same address on multiple chains, what's kind of missing. Or what are the complications there, and what are some potential solutions for this?
00:30:29.804 - 00:30:47.990, Speaker B: Right? So these are the ideas that I was thinking about when I wrote that post on the three transitions a couple of weeks ago. Basically, that it's obvious to everyone that in order to have affordable transaction fees, we have to make things work on layer twos.
00:30:48.070 - 00:30:48.602, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:48.736 - 00:31:00.602, Speaker B: It's obvious to, I think, to increasingly everyone that EOAS are not acceptable. And we need to have smart contract wallets if we want to have wallet security, especially for not super technical users.
00:31:00.666 - 00:31:01.374, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:01.572 - 00:31:07.010, Speaker B: Who here would trust their grandma to safely hold $3 million at an EOA?
00:31:07.670 - 00:31:10.498, Speaker A: Want to point out that zero hands have been raised for the video?
00:31:10.584 - 00:31:10.930, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:11.000 - 00:31:12.260, Speaker C: Okay. Right.
00:31:13.270 - 00:31:42.982, Speaker B: Who here still uses an EOA some, right? For me, fortunately, the EOAS hold less than 3% of my money, but I want to improve on that, too. By the way, this is another thing, right? Even if you need to have a the Cold Wallet hot wallet separation is really useful, right? The money that you need to use, fine. Stick it in whatever is convenient. The money that easier. Life savings, stake it in a safe. Like a gnosis safe wallet.
00:31:43.046 - 00:31:43.370, Speaker C: Right?
00:31:43.440 - 00:31:46.190, Speaker B: Kohir uses Gnosis safe.
00:31:46.530 - 00:31:48.110, Speaker A: That's a lot of hands. That's great.
00:31:48.180 - 00:32:10.130, Speaker B: Perfect. This is good. Kuhir uses a Gnosis safe wallet that has more than three participants in it and that has a threshold of at least three. This is good. Yeah. See, this is very much improved compared to a few years ago, right? So this is amazing. We're making progress.
00:32:10.210 - 00:32:10.840, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:11.930 - 00:32:28.870, Speaker B: To me, I think fees and safety are roughly equally important, because if you just think about what is the total amount of money that people have lost to fees being way too high, it's like over a billion dollars. And then if you look at the amount of money that people have lost to all kinds of hacks, it's like, also over a billion dollars.
00:32:28.940 - 00:32:29.174, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:29.212 - 00:32:30.766, Speaker A: How significant can be more?
00:32:30.868 - 00:32:41.646, Speaker B: Right? Exactly. Both of these things are a big deal, right. And it's, I think, really important to solve both of them.
00:32:41.668 - 00:32:41.902, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:41.956 - 00:33:44.046, Speaker B: But the challenge is, like, if you try to do both together, right? So there is this concept called a counterfactual address, right? So when you receive your ETH for the first time, who here remembers when they received ETH for the first time? Right, buddy? When you received ETH for the first time, you received it to an Ethereum address. You were able to get your money into an Ethereum address without having already registered that Ethereum address on chain, right. Why? Well, because to register an address on chain, you needed to have already sent a transaction, which already required paying transaction fees, which required already having ETH, right. So the first ETH you receive has to go into an address that is generated off chain without some kind of on chain registration process, right. Get that? Okay. So then this is very easy for EOAS, right? Because for an EOA, the address is just a hash of the public key. Now, in a layer two world, you have many of these addresses.
00:33:44.046 - 00:34:26.286, Speaker B: You have an address on every one of these L two S, right? So who here has used polygon Zkevm so far? Okay? Some of you have probably received weird AirDrop tokens on polygon Zkevm without even having access to system right? Now, you are able to retrieve those tokens later if you want to. Why? Because the address is the same on every chain. And so you can use those same keys and you can go and access them later even if you have not interacted with polygon before. Now, here is a challenge with social recovery wallets. Let's say you have a social recovery.
00:34:26.318 - 00:34:31.586, Speaker A: Wallet which are not EOAS. Which are not EOAS right.
00:34:31.608 - 00:34:56.582, Speaker B: Which are not EOS. They have to be smart contracts. And then let's say you initialize your social recovery wallet on Ethereum Mainet, and you also initialize it on Zksync, right? Then what happens? Let's say months go by, years go by. At some point, you lose your key. You have to reset your key. Okay, fine. You reset it on Mainnet, you reset it on Zksync.
00:34:56.582 - 00:35:52.778, Speaker B: Then you realize, oh, wait, you received a really huge payment, but someone sent it to you on optimism. You go and see can you access it? Oh, wait, you have not yet initialized your account on optimism. And you can initialize your account with create two because of the address, but await the address depends on the initial key and not the current key. And so you don't have the initial key anymore, and so you're screwed, right? So the problem is basically these kinds of issues, they're intersectional, right? They only appear when you have scaling and you have smart contract wallets at the same time. Now, in my post, of my last two posts, I talk a lot about architectures that can try to solve this problem, architectures that can try to let you have your funds across many different L two s, but at the same time, make it practical for upgrading to happen. Make it practical for key changes to happen and to solve for this counterfactual address problem.
00:35:52.864 - 00:35:56.302, Speaker A: But it's like, still requires everybody to opt in.
00:35:56.356 - 00:36:47.022, Speaker B: Exactly. This stuff requires people to actually build the technology, right? And then if we talk about privacy, when I ask people, would you be comfortable holding most of your wealth on a multi SIG where your keys are owned by your friends, right, or family members? Look, when asked so far, the biggest answer for why not has been privacy, right? It's like, okay, maybe you trust your mom not to go and discover the four other people that you put on your multi SIG and manage to find them without tipping you off and work with them to steal your money. But do you necessarily trust your mom or do you necessarily want your mom to be able to snoop on all your transactions? Right? That's like a type of trust for your family members that a lot of people don't have.
00:36:47.076 - 00:36:47.680, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:51.810 - 00:37:02.914, Speaker B: It turns out that there are ways to use cryptography to do social recovery in such a way that your mom is guarding your account, but your mom does not have to see what all of your addresses are.
00:37:03.032 - 00:37:03.506, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:03.608 - 00:37:13.314, Speaker B: And this is doable. It requires fancier cryptography, but it's a knowledge, it has to be implemented.
00:37:13.362 - 00:37:13.622, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:13.676 - 00:37:22.250, Speaker B: And this is like, again, it's like intersection. All right? This is an issue that only comes up if you care about having privacy and you care about having social recovery at the same time.
00:37:22.320 - 00:37:22.746, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:22.848 - 00:37:48.100, Speaker B: And so we have to really think about all of these things as an ecosystem and think about these things holistically which is why I think what we need is not isolated teams working on individual parts of the problem is not enough. We need much higher amounts of coordination between different layers of the ecosystem to really try to solve all of these problems and work together and really make them work in an actually existing community.
00:37:49.510 - 00:38:31.406, Speaker A: Actually, I was going to do a follow up, but I think we should change topics. I want to talk about some other things that have been happening that are not related to scaling. Everybody who applied here, we kind of asked you a question on what is it that you want to see and why you're excited about this space. And lot of everybody filled out that answer. I read through all of them and there's a really interesting pattern because everybody who was not coming here from the hackathon side really kind of wanted to see and be at this event because they wanted to learn what they can use blockchains for and what are the applications. And this is an interesting theme because for the last six years, we've constantly been talking about these things, and we kind of tell people about this.
00:38:31.428 - 00:38:32.426, Speaker B: What you can do as a developer.
00:38:32.458 - 00:39:30.274, Speaker A: All the financial and interesting applications, whether it's Dows, NFTs, what have you, all those things are things that we see, but they don't apply to everybody day to day. And one kind of interesting thing that we noticed as, like, a side effect was that, effectively, the common theme in all those communities that we've seen, whether it's dows different NFT communities, ETH global hackathons, is that they are effectively bringing a small group of people together that share a certain interest and effectively using Web Three and cryptocurrencies to come together. And that is an application in my definition. I'm not sure if you agree that community forms around these interest groups. And that kind of was like, oh, this is interesting as an observation. And then it just occurred to me that you also, in a way tested this theory live with Zuzulu. So for those of you who don't know what this is, I'd love for you to tell people about what the experiment was and what the initial goals were and how did things turn out.
00:39:30.392 - 00:39:54.602, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically, Zuzulu was this social experiment in trying to basically see what is a kind of practical, actually implementable version of this whole crypto cities network state coordination kind of concept, actually is right. Of trying to bring people together in physical space.
00:39:54.736 - 00:39:56.582, Speaker A: So what is an hour state for the audience?
00:39:56.646 - 00:39:56.874, Speaker C: Right?
00:39:56.912 - 00:40:45.898, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think it's almost better to not answer that question because lots of people have different you have like a polarizing. Yeah. I think what the cluster of ideas is, is basically this cluster of, can we take existing online communities and bring people together in physical space and create offline communities that are able to be in physical space, benefit from just being in an environment where people can interact with other people who have similar interests and values benefit from some kind of network effects and ability to collectively organize around specific things that that community cares about collectively but that existing governments don't even think to provide because it's a niche interest.
00:40:45.984 - 00:40:46.620, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:47.070 - 00:40:51.900, Speaker A: It has to be tied into potentially having different rules and laws around.
00:40:53.890 - 00:41:08.814, Speaker B: Yeah. Or even simple things. Like if you have a community that cares about healthy food, you try really hard to collectively work to make healthy food very available with lots of varieties in a very small radius.
00:41:08.862 - 00:41:09.314, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:09.432 - 00:41:58.178, Speaker B: If we care about privacy, then actually go and basically make it a norm in the community that privacy preserving technology is the default. And sorry, if we catch you using Google Docs three times, you're kicked out forever. And really kind of create the network effects to kind of push for the technology and the knowledge around the technology to kind of work inside the community. Right, and so the idea here was to basically take 200 people, bring them into Montenegro, and basically it's a combination of the ethereum community, some longevity researchers, people who are just enthusiasts about the concept of communities and governance in general, and stay for two months and basically just be a pop up city.
00:41:58.264 - 00:41:58.898, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:59.064 - 00:42:25.414, Speaker B: So the idea here is people have met 200 people, person events have happened before, right. But they're called conferences. Conferences only last a week. Things lasting two months or even years have existed before. They're called hacker houses. But hacker houses only have college people. Right, but something with 200 people and the last two months, that's like a step in a kind of fundamental, like a different direction.
00:42:25.462 - 00:42:25.674, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:25.712 - 00:42:45.562, Speaker B: And obviously universities exist and cities and countries exist, but this is like taking creed, taking something new and putting it into that level. Right, and it's a significant step up enough that you actually learn things that you would not have learned from smaller formats, but it's still small enough that it's practical and manageable.
00:42:45.626 - 00:42:45.998, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:46.084 - 00:43:08.860, Speaker B: In some manok. We actually did this experiment and there were a lot of these different interesting subcomponents to it. So there was this very strong health culture. We basically worked with one of the restaurants and we basically got them to offer this healthy vegan breakfast menu that was inspired by the Brian Johnson menu. Who is this?
00:43:09.470 - 00:43:15.082, Speaker A: You've seen him on News by he's the guy who spends 2 million a year to keep his health.
00:43:15.216 - 00:43:35.234, Speaker B: Exactly. That's the guy. Right. Like one of these very deep gurus who basically reorganizes his life around being healthy. And one of the experiments here is, can we create a version of him and his beliefs and his ideas that don't require you to spend huge amounts of money and sink your entire life into it?
00:43:35.272 - 00:43:35.522, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:35.576 - 00:43:53.894, Speaker B: And we basically created this vegan breakfast buffet that was inspired by or basically that was as much of his menu as we could practically implement on a budget of $15 a day that was compatible with what could be realistically ships to Montenegro. And it worked pretty well and people actually liked it.
00:43:53.932 - 00:43:54.278, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:54.364 - 00:44:17.422, Speaker B: And then there were other things, like there was a lot of hiking and running happening. There were these daily cold plunges that a bunch of people participated in and that side of the culture actually worked. And then on the crypto side, there was this app that got developed. It was called Zoopass. I can actually show it right now. Hold on, sorry.
00:44:17.476 - 00:44:18.942, Speaker A: Just let the camera zoom in.
00:44:18.996 - 00:44:48.742, Speaker B: Yeah, well, just load it up. Yeah. So just switching to a different profile on my graphene OS here, then okay, click Zoopass and then it loads. And hopefully the Internet here works. So this is a QR code. This QR code contains a zero knowledge proof. So this is literally a snark that proves that I am a member of the Zuzulu resident group without revealing which of the members I am.
00:44:48.876 - 00:44:49.378, Speaker C: Right?
00:44:49.484 - 00:45:24.798, Speaker B: So one of the use cases of this that you can think about are like, if you think of GovTech. Governments are thinking a lot about how to digitize. And one of the challenges with this, with this whole digitization process is basically the way that it ends up being developed by default. It ends up being like a total disaster in terms of privacy at the same time, right? You have CBDCs and this desire by some basically international elites to try to push people into a cashless society.
00:45:24.894 - 00:45:29.014, Speaker A: Somehow it always boils down to seeing your face and having a camera recognize you.
00:45:29.052 - 00:45:58.602, Speaker B: You have your cameras everywhere basically move to this cachless approach that just completely removes a type of privacy that has been a basic part of human civilization for thousands of years. Right. If you look at all of these new uses of needing digital QR codes to access things in person, and there's just huge amounts of tracking that become enabled by that, right? And forms of privacy that have existed for thousands of years are just becoming gone within a decade.
00:45:58.666 - 00:45:59.278, Speaker C: Right.
00:45:59.444 - 00:46:28.530, Speaker B: And what you can do with this kind of technology is you can give people the kind of access control guarantees that people are looking for. So we use this QR code, for example, just to gate access to some of the events that were happening, especially when there were just like too many people and lots of people coming in from the outside and there were limited seats, and we did this without by using these QR codes. And so that ended up not actually compromising people's privacy.
00:46:28.610 - 00:46:29.094, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:29.212 - 00:46:44.366, Speaker B: There are also use cases of this online, right? So you can use your zoopass to log into things. And so there was a system called Zoopoll where you can log in with zoopass and so you can prove to the system that you are a Zuzulu resident without proving which resident you are. And you could go vote on things.
00:46:44.468 - 00:46:44.734, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:44.772 - 00:46:58.546, Speaker B: This was like an actual security digital voting system that preserved people's identities. Most voting people, or preserved the privacy of people's identities and at the same time preserved the property that you can.
00:46:58.568 - 00:46:59.458, Speaker A: Track who it is.
00:46:59.544 - 00:47:09.110, Speaker B: Well, no, you can't track who it is. You can track the facts that each resident only voted once, and you can track that the Kremlin did not vote 58,424 times.
00:47:09.260 - 00:47:11.638, Speaker A: Why are the polls 140% in favor?
00:47:11.724 - 00:47:49.822, Speaker B: Exactly, right, yeah. Unfortunately, the 146% are not welcome in these polls. Basically, we use Zuzzle as like a testing ground for this kind of technology. And it actually worked. Right. There were a huge amount of user experience hiccups, but over the course of a month of active usage within a community, we managed to actually solve all of those hiccups, made the user experience much more seamless. The zero knowledge proving became five times faster, everything became much better, and it turned into this technology that now realistically can be applied in all kinds of other events and conferences.
00:47:49.886 - 00:47:50.066, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:50.088 - 00:48:06.610, Speaker B: So I absolutely think that for future each global events, if you need access control, you could literally use zoopass QR code tech instead of requiring things that reveals much more about your identity.
00:48:06.690 - 00:48:07.320, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:08.090 - 00:48:41.874, Speaker B: And then there's this concept within Zoopool called stamps. So I can show this again, right? So if you scroll down, you see there's a bunch of these stamps, and I can click on these, and there's one thing called Team Cat, and see, there's a stamp verifying that I'm on Team Cat. And stamps are basically like pokes, except the difference is that you can prove that you have a stamp or you can prove any arbitrary function over those stamps without revealing which specific stamps you have, or even without revealing who you are.
00:48:41.912 - 00:48:42.306, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:42.408 - 00:48:51.222, Speaker B: So if you want to make your own local party that's only accessible to people from Team Cat, or you're trying.
00:48:51.276 - 00:48:55.734, Speaker A: To any sort of access control exactly.
00:48:55.932 - 00:49:33.166, Speaker B: You want to have your online forum where only people who actually participated in events of having to do with Zuzulu history can participate in. Because you don't want people from the rival I don't know what the dog lover, what's a good name for a rival tribe? I don't know, solana Village, whatever. You don't want people from Solana Village sneaking in, then you can do access controller and at the same time keep the thing private.
00:49:33.198 - 00:49:33.586, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:33.688 - 00:50:09.678, Speaker B: So I think the point is that you can actually try all of these things inside of a kind of community that's deeply dedicated to particular values and you can actually reinforce the values and reinforce the technology a lot of at the same time and just make a huge amount of progress. And at the same time. The other thing that I wanted to experiment on is just this fact that where the network effect is, just what physical location the network effect is. That's not something that we need to kind of surrender to as a fact of life. That's something that we can choose.
00:50:09.764 - 00:50:10.400, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:11.170 - 00:50:28.582, Speaker B: If all of the stuff is happening in New York, but as it turns out New York is part of the United States and the United States has an immigration policy that's not accessible to a huge number of people, then well, guess what? We can go choose as a community and we can go make a hub somewhere else.
00:50:28.636 - 00:50:30.310, Speaker A: And we did that all throughout COVID.
00:50:30.890 - 00:50:39.842, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think that's something that really is good for empowering communities and especially good for empowering communities that are global.
00:50:39.906 - 00:50:40.146, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:40.188 - 00:51:04.462, Speaker B: And that kind of coordination is something that I think itself was part of the experiment and it's something that I hope that we start seeing more versions of happening in the future. So one experiment of many, but generally I hope that we can do more cool things and scale this sort of stuff up and make it more valuable in the future.
00:51:04.596 - 00:51:29.930, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I think with just how connected everybody is and how we're making it seamless to transact to across borders, pop up cities are going to be a pretty big norm. So the last question I want to ask before we kind of end this is we kind of talked about the reflecting in the last ten years, but in terms of kind of what the next ten years look like, what kind of do you think are some active themes or things you want to see from the culture of this ethereum ecosystem? Embody?
00:51:32.270 - 00:52:28.938, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the things is I think it's important to just take culture and values more seriously. Right. So one of the stories that I think about is if you think about the history of Ubuntu, like the Linux distribution over the last 20 years right. Basically the theory there was that we had Linux and Linux was like this toy that it was very deep and very valuable tech. But from the outside point of view it was this toy that basically appealed to computer geeks, right? But then people tried to create Ubuntu and theory of Ubuntu is okay, we're going to be pragmatic and we're going to make some compromises. But at the same time, the upside of this is that we'll make something that's usable by average people. And we're going to try to push all of the open stuff into the background and just make it be an operating system.
00:52:28.938 - 00:52:43.998, Speaker B: And then we're going to make the best desktop and we're going to actually beat Windows and Mac. This ended up not happening and as a result, basically they had neither the values nor the mass adoption. And I think there's parts of the.
00:52:44.004 - 00:52:50.514, Speaker A: Crypto space that you went back to being more CLI default because that's when people just took convenience and took the GUI out, right?
00:52:50.552 - 00:53:26.062, Speaker B: And I often worry that within the crypto space we end up falling into a similar trap, right. It's like we mainstream crypto but then crypto is all done inside of centralized exchanges. We mainstream NFTs, but then NFTs are all being run inside of centralized platforms or there are these really high references stores and there's not that much actual openness happening. That's not the kind of crypto world that I actually want to see.
00:53:26.116 - 00:53:26.430, Speaker C: Right?
00:53:26.500 - 00:53:57.154, Speaker B: And the kind of crypto world that makes sense is one where we actually take decentralization seriously. We take seriously the idea that we're trying to build systems where you can't get rug pulled. We take seriously the idea that we're trying to build systems where if the original operators disappear, the code is open source. Not even shared source, open source and where it can actually be freely copied by other people. And those other people can go and they can start maintaining the system from there and they can pick up the slack.
00:53:57.202 - 00:53:57.846, Speaker C: Right?
00:53:58.028 - 00:54:46.162, Speaker B: And so you as a user, even if the original operators of the system disappear, you as a user are still fine, right? And you as a user can still continue. Take seriously the fact that we want to build systems where people do actually have privacy. And this inevitable transition to digitization that society is going through does not at the same time become a transition where we basically surrender all of our rights and control to a very small number of centralized organizations. Take seriously the fact that we're trying to build an ecosystem that values collaboration and openness and that values people working together with each other and building tools that work together instead of building empires that try to conquer everything and end up standing apart and fighting.
00:54:46.226 - 00:54:46.742, Speaker C: Right?
00:54:46.876 - 00:54:57.542, Speaker B: And I think keeping this whole spirit alive is something that's very important for the space to have meaning. But I think it's also very important for the space to be successful.
00:54:57.606 - 00:54:58.170, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:58.320 - 00:55:28.354, Speaker B: If we don't have collaboration and standardization for the three transitions that I talked about, then it's not going to happen and we're going to have like 14 incompatible standards, right. If we don't have collaboration on getting privacy systems adopted and figuring out what version of that can be legitimized, including by exchanges that have regulatory concerns, then we're going to have a system where that technology is going to be much less meaningful.
00:55:28.402 - 00:55:28.662, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:28.716 - 00:55:46.594, Speaker B: If we have a system where we keep working on a small number of applications but nothing ever actually gets that far because we never actually beat the network effect barrier, then we're not actually successful.
00:55:46.642 - 00:55:46.806, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:46.828 - 00:55:52.640, Speaker B: And so we need to actually work on making all of those things happen.
00:55:53.170 - 00:55:57.020, Speaker A: I think that's a wonderful note to end this on which Alec, thank you so much for being here today.
