00:00:02.250 - 00:01:03.070, Speaker A: Why aren't you changing your background? All I got is the police sirens in the background, straight out of Compton. All right, I think we're all set. I'm recording and the slides are incoming. All right, so welcome, everybody. Again, sorry for the delay, but this is Market Make judging session eight, and today we're going to be knocking out the last of the projects we haven't presented yet. So I'm going to start off with just a quick intro. For the hackathon, we had 490 hackers from 58 countries and 17 time zones, which is pretty incredible.
00:01:03.070 - 00:01:52.194, Speaker A: We had people from all over the world, and it was really a great experience to see just the variety of people we had attending this and building projects with us. In the end result, we had 120 projects from all of these teams. Again, a huge diversity in lending in D, five projects in NFT, all over the place. So we were really excited to see the number and the variety in the projects that came out of it. So the format for this session, if you're not aware, if you haven't come to an ETH Global event before, here's just a quick overview. Four minutes for the video demo, which is pre recorded. Some teams might speak over it or do a live voiceover, but typically they'll just be playing it.
00:01:52.194 - 00:02:50.114, Speaker A: And then we'll have four minutes for questions. We'll pop in short breaks every few projects just for the judges to chat to each other and catch up on their thoughts and entering their scores. And then we'll do a longer ten minute break, sometime about halfway, just to let people stretch their legs or get a drink. And then generally, just for hackers to be aware of. The criteria that we suggest to judges is technicality, originality, practicality, how people use it, which means the UI UX, and then the final wow factor, which can be up to their discretion, just something that pops out to them or something that they feel sets it apart from other projects. Generally, we want to remind people, both hackers and judges, that this is not necessarily a competition. While obviously some people bring a competitive mindset, that's totally fine.
00:02:50.114 - 00:03:20.938, Speaker A: But we find that a lot of our hackers are here to learn. They're trying to sometimes just get feedback. Some of our projects have gone on to become businesses, get investment, but not everybody is doing that. So we're just really proud of everybody who's been able to build something and present something at the end of this hackathon. And finally, before we start, I'll just give a quick intro to our judges. Today. We have Sergey from one inch, Evan, Venus from weekend ethereum and Pete Kim from Coinbase.
00:03:20.938 - 00:03:45.718, Speaker A: We're really thankful for all of them sharing their time and expertise to give feedback to our projects today. And with that, we're going to jump right into the first project. Unless judges need anything, we're going to jump right into it. Speak now forever. Hold your piece. Yep, let's do it. Cool.
00:03:45.718 - 00:04:30.990, Speaker A: The first project is orca protocol. I will let the team share their screen and give us their demo. I was just wondering if you could let Stephen Velaryon he was having some trouble joining. Yep. Thank you. Hi, we are Team Orca, and today we will be demoing the Orca Protocol, a flexible and adaptable Dao implementation. Our team members are John Sterlachi, Stephen Valeri, Will Kim, Daniel Thompson and myself, Julie Rosenberg.
00:04:30.990 - 00:05:31.010, Speaker A: It's no secret that existing DAOs have a usability problem. Most are either overly complicated or not robust enough. Current governance frameworks lack ways to meaningfully manage hierarchy and permissions which create voter apathy and misaligned voter incentives. A protocol which allows Dows to easily create flexible rules and manage permissions is critical in order for Onchain governance to reach its full potential. This is why we created Orca Protocol, a gas efficient, simple resistant Dow implementation using ERC 1155 equipped with a simple UI dashboard to manage Dow proposals and allow onchain voting for onChase assets, all secured using nosis safe. Orca is made up of Pods organizations which consist of a fixed number of member tokens, each representing a single vote. Each Pod is linked to a multi SIG vault to securely hold shared on chain assets.
00:05:31.010 - 00:06:24.260, Speaker A: Pods are flexible and built modularly to accommodate infinite use cases including project governance, pooled investing, community management and so much more. The Orca Protocol mints and distributes the Pod's ERC 1155 member tokens. In order to claim a membership, one must meet the Pod member requirements and rules. Pod members can create proposals and vote on whether to execute a proposal. Could be internal defining requirements to hold membership or external performing on chain actions such as deploying Pod funds. All proposals are executed on chain by a network of third party users called Shepherds in exchange for Orca tokens. These Shepherds and Share proposals are executed fairly and member requirements are being met.
00:06:24.260 - 00:06:57.578, Speaker A: Now that you understand the infrastructure, let's see how Jane would use the Orca Protocol interface. Jane opens her Orca Protocol iOS App on her dashboard. She can see her pods and any urgent Pod proposals. Market Bake Club has an active internal proposal requiring members hold sushi. She votes Yay to implement the proposal directly from her dashboard. Jane is going to try to join a new Pod Sofa Direct Club. This Pod has two internal rules.
00:06:57.578 - 00:07:35.050, Speaker A: One, pod members must hold 120 ave and Pod members must delegate their Ave to vote to the Pod. Jane only meets one of those requirements. She now goes to Ave to delegate her vote and comes back. Jane now complies with the Pod internal requirements and claims her membership. Jane wants to create a new external proposal. She selects the Aave rule library and proposes that the Pod use its delegated voting power to vote yes on Ave governance. Prop Seven the proposal is now available to other members to vote on.
00:07:35.050 - 00:08:18.150, Speaker A: If the proposal passes, it will automatically get executed by the Orca network, and that is the Orca Protocol. We are incredibly excited and plan to finish the Web app shortly, bring Orca to the mainnet, build out a comprehensive integration library and implement Pod hierarchy systems. We hope Orca Protocol will empower all types of organizations to lean into decentralized governance. Here's where you can find out more. And thank you so much for your time. So you said the web app was coming. I take it that means you did the phone app first.
00:08:18.150 - 00:09:26.560, Speaker A: Right now we just have clickable mocks. We have the basic set up for a create react app, but we're still working on finishing the last little bit of it. Cool. What made you decide to what was the inspiration? Just frustration with existing Dow frameworks? Yeah, I mean, sort of the frustration came around the ability for people to collaborate. And we think I don't know if you've ever joined a discord group and it starts out really cool with like ten or 15 people, but once it balloons into a couple of hundred, the productivity and the ability to do meaningful things kind of goes down. So we had the thought of what if we create governance around these pods which are fixed sizes, and it sort of creates these little action groups which can sort of self manage themselves but also collaborate with other action. Sorry, go ahead.
00:09:26.560 - 00:10:30.642, Speaker A: Sorry about that. I wanted to ask you about the Sherpa model that you mentioned. You mentioned that they execute proposals on behalf. So are you thinking is it kind of like meta submit transactions on Ethereum on behalf and in return they get tokens? Is that what you're thinking? Because the gas prices are too high. Yeah. So right now we just did like a naive implementation and the pods themselves store the transaction on chain and then if the voting thresholds are met, then the shepherds are free to execute them and the shepherds pay the gas in return for the fees. Future State we'd like to do something with the gas station network to see how we can sort of distribute that gas cost more evenly to either the entire Orca network or on a pod by pod basis.
00:10:30.642 - 00:11:16.980, Speaker A: But that's the setup for I see. Do the participants in the pod have to stake the tokens for Orca or new orcas get minted to reward those people that submit transactions for you? So we're still working on the tokenomics a little bit. We're going to have a pod that basically manages the token distributions on chain. So yeah, we're still trying to figure out whether we do a staking mechanism or we just mint new tokens, but that's something we're trying to work out currently. I see. By the way, really awesome UI. It looks really pretty.
00:11:16.980 - 00:11:53.840, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Also from my side, looks very well. I like that you just implemented an iOS device and yeah, looks great. What was your biggest challenge in the development of the application and the whole architecture? I could give this to Stephen real quick. Yeah. So it's probably around implementing the internal rules. So we set it up in a way where you can have really generic functions for claiming membership, but then you also want shepherds to be able to call those rules over time.
00:11:53.840 - 00:12:23.260, Speaker A: And the way you encode some of the parameters, like message sender, is not the message sender when a shepherd is calling the function. So just making things super generic for both the internal and external rules got pretty technically challenging just around managing all the call data and encoding things correctly. Okay, great. Thanks. Very cool, guys. Cool implementation. Good idea.
00:12:23.260 - 00:12:40.954, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Thank you. Yeah. Can't wait to see all launch this. It looks really great. Definitely great. It sounds like all of our judges have had a chance to respond.
00:12:40.954 - 00:13:11.140, Speaker A: So thank you orca for being the first project to present as part of this session. We're going to move on to the next team, which is Copy trader. If you haven't been promoted yet to panelists, please raise your hand in the chat and we'll get you up here. Looks like we've got Marcelo Emerik. Is there anybody else? Otherwise, they should be able to start whenever you're ready. Yeah, sure. I will share my screen.
00:13:11.140 - 00:13:57.776, Speaker A: Hello, welcome to our video for Marketmech Akaton. We are Mime protocol. We are a team of two people, marcelo Baris and I am Rick Segen. Our project is called Mime Protocol, and it enables users of Ethereum to copy transaction of each other. So how does it work? Let's start with an example. So, Alice follows Bob's address on Ethereum. Bob makes a transaction.
00:13:57.776 - 00:14:39.524, Speaker A: Mime Protocol notices it and will replicate the transaction on behalf of Alice. So our future work is going to be focused on adding more integrations with it ave, as you will see in the demo, and overall improve the UI in the UX, as well as doing some gas optimization in Solidity. So now let's go with the demo. We've got MetaMask connected to our site. First of all, we're going to create a contract which copies all transactions made by a different address. We're going to provide the address of the address we want to follow. Yeah.
00:14:39.524 - 00:15:00.730, Speaker A: And the second parameter is the strategy. I will explain that later. Yeah. We approved the transaction in MetaMask. Now that event should be catched by our server. You can see in the corner. Yeah, it was.
00:15:00.730 - 00:15:20.696, Speaker A: We see a new contract deployed. We can view that's. I hope you like the UI. It's really simple. We see our contract. First of all, we're going to deposit some eater and then some die. We have two different pools.
00:15:20.696 - 00:16:08.300, Speaker A: The first is operation Pools, and the second is Relay Pools. Now we're going to deposit to the relay pool. Okay. As always, we interact with MetaMask. We wait for the transaction to be confirmed. But in the meantime, we will switch to Ava because we'll copy a deposit on average. That's it.
00:16:08.300 - 00:16:48.628, Speaker A: First of all, we must give an approval. We deposit 25 die, we wait for the approval. And now this transaction should be catched by our server and should be triggered its relay. And the contract now should also approve, as we see. And in a few seconds, we should see a new transaction. So now we just see one transaction because basically we copied the approve and we also copied, you see, two transactions now. So maybe let's open the second one because the first is just the approval.
00:16:48.628 - 00:17:23.620, Speaker A: So, yeah, as you saw, we've got two columns. The first one is base transaction, which actually refers to these transactions that we copied. And the second one is the transaction that specifies how the other transaction was copied. So as you see, the sender is the relayer. Basically, that's us, that's the protocol. And the recipient is the contract that we deploy. And what happened through some internal transactions, we deposited on average just to make sure we'll open the locks emitted during this transaction.
00:17:23.620 - 00:18:07.900, Speaker A: Let's scroll down. And as you see, the last one is deposit and who deposits the smart contract. So basically yeah. Great, thanks. Any judges want to start us off? Yeah, looks great. I just have one question right now. You were showing there's this thing called strategy contract, and in your demo it was for ave deposits.
00:18:07.900 - 00:18:52.700, Speaker A: So for different types of protocols, would you have to provide the strategy contract? No, basically every user can select one. For now, we've got just one strategy. And what is the strategy? We didn't manage to explain that. In the demo, it's a set of manipulators because a transaction is basically to interact with a smart contract, you need to provide some data to this transaction. So, yeah, basically the manipulator is just the strategy is a set of manipulators which specify how you need to manipulate the row bytes of that data to execute the transaction on behalf of yourself. Got you. Okay.
00:18:52.700 - 00:20:00.144, Speaker A: And I'm pretty sure you're foreseeing that people will be creating those strategy contracts for different types of protocol. Yeah, for now, just ave, but we close to implement the uniswap interfaces. Very cool. It seems like an obvious thing that some of these on chain analytics companies like Nansen or whatever would be interested in buying, integrating, whatever. I'm curious, why did you just decide to build this? Because you were aping into transactions off of something you saw off Nansen and you thought, like, hey, we should build, oh, maybe the first inspiration was, like to maybe create something totally strange and crazy. But after all, we realized that we're building something really similar to Etoro. So we just focus on keep going that way.
00:20:00.144 - 00:20:37.144, Speaker A: So, yeah, we managed to do that. And the most crazy stuff was, like, to do very low level stuff on the EVM. So yeah, that was really nice. I have another question. So if I'm copying, say, xerox b one for example, I obviously won't be able to do it just because he owns so much more money than I do. So is it possible for you to adjust the amount? That's a very good question. So as I said before, the strategy has a set of manipulators and into that manipulator actually inject just the context.
00:20:37.144 - 00:21:39.152, Speaker A: And the context is basically the contract that is copying the transaction. So for now, our API map do not implement like dynamic changing of the parameters but we can easily do it. But for the hackathon we did not focus on that because it's just like to get the balance of the copied trader and the balance of the copy trading copy trader and just doing some math over it just about injecting context. Yeah, sure. Did you also plan to integrate a security layer? Because if someone knows that someone follows them so they can trick them out. That's the most important question. So for instance, if I'm aware that someone's copying me and I will decide just to move all of my funds to an external account to trigger the same to happen by a different account, that won't happen.
00:21:39.152 - 00:22:17.212, Speaker A: Why? Because as I said, we have strategies and for every strategy we define which kind of transaction can be copied and how they can be copied. So for instance, I can define that we will copy just the transactions which represent interaction with uniswap. And if you interact with uniswap, you can just copy swap tokens for exact tokens and within that swap tokens for exact tokens you can trade just on maybe a liquidity pool of dai and rapido. So yeah, that's it. That's how it works. Okay, great. Awesome work guys.
00:22:17.212 - 00:22:53.406, Speaker A: Very interesting. Yeah. I think that's time, unless there's any final comments, we're going to move on to the next team. All right, thank you, copy trader. Next up is Mantis. Mantis, I think you are already here, so I'll let you get started when you're ready. Hi, I'll be giving you a walkthrough of Mantis.
00:22:53.406 - 00:23:24.298, Speaker A: Mantis is a portal to leverage an Avi using one inch use cases leverage assets with a long position. Let's say you're long on ethereum, you expect the price to rise. You can use Mantis to leverage your position and increase your ETH exposure like say three times and earn higher profits. Second is leverage assets with favorable interest. Let's say Link has a much higher interest than Dai. We can leverage Link against Dai and get a higher net interest flow. The flow is as follows let's say a user wishes to increase his ETH exposure over Dai.
00:23:24.298 - 00:24:04.522, Speaker A: He'll first need to approve Dai to Mantis, approve delegation to borrow Dai on his behalf and call leverage Mantis. What happens then is that Mantis initiates a flash loan using Nave, receives Dai, swaps the Dai for wrapped ethereum using balinch deposits wrapped ethereum on lending pool and borrows Dai. And this Dai ultimately pays back the Flash loan. The leverage factor is calculated as follows. Mantis uses credit delegation to borrow on behalf of the user to pay back the Flash loan. This removes the need to use a proxy contract unlike other current platforms. So since there is no proxy involved, you can view your positions on the RV dashboard as so.
00:24:04.522 - 00:24:38.886, Speaker A: Let's try this out. Mantis is currently running on a hard hat mainnet folk. This is to enable anyone to seamlessly tie off the app without actually spending actual money. It can also be deployed to the main net. Let's copy this URL. This is a URL to my hosted hard app node chain ID is seven. There we go.
00:24:38.886 - 00:24:56.936, Speaker A: Let's go to the app. Let's go to the wallet and get some free tokens. You can choose any token you wish to see. Let's go to Dai. See, the balance has increased. Let's go to the home page. Now.
00:24:56.936 - 00:25:26.640, Speaker A: Choose the asset you wish to leverage. Let's take rapid Ethereum for now. Leverage against. Put in the amount, choose the interest mode and select the loan to value ratio. Let's keep this around 0.6. There is low liquidity ratio, low liquidity risk. Approved to Mantis delegate to Mantis approved delegation leverage.
00:25:26.640 - 00:25:50.810, Speaker A: The position has increased. This is a real time position on Ave. Basically, with just this amount of Ethereum, you have created a much more leveraged position in Abe. That is around 2.5 times. Thank you. Hi there.
00:25:50.810 - 00:26:32.592, Speaker A: Very cool. Can you compare the gas compared to some of the other things out there that do similar things? Especially after you've done three transactions compared to other platforms, right? Yeah. So more than gas cost. I would rather explain how this is different. Let's say DeFi saver, right? For DeFi saver and all, they use proxy contracts which are going to cost more as well. And at the top of that, you cannot see your positions on the RB dashboard. Since I'm using credit delegation, there is no proxy involved.
00:26:32.592 - 00:27:07.360, Speaker A: Right. So you can directly interact with the platform and see your positions on the Abbey dashboard as well. Yeah. So are you saying you haven't benchmarked the guess? Is that what you're saying? No, the thing is about one inch. I tried to benchmark the gas cost, but one inch gives me a different route based on two different assets. Right, based on the current best route. So it's a bit difficult to get the maximum gas cost right? Because it's dynamic.
00:27:07.360 - 00:27:27.284, Speaker A: Got it. I wish we had someone here who knew anything about one inch. Yeah. One question from our side. So you run your own mainnet fork, is it right? Yeah. Main net node on AWS. Yeah.
00:27:27.284 - 00:27:48.590, Speaker A: That's because I wanted people to try out the app. And one issue is currently not available on the testnet, right? Yeah. Because of all the 43 integrations they have. Yeah. That sounds great. And you were really able to create leverage position on the main network right? With using one h. That's great.
00:27:48.590 - 00:28:30.800, Speaker A: That's really interesting. We will get in touch with you after the hackathon for sure. Thank you. Great. I think that yeah, I don't really have a question right now but really interesting project, I'd love to check it out and try it once it becomes available on the main, it's hosted on Mitos net in anyone can check it out, you'll just have to connect a MetaMask instance to my RPC URL. Okay, very cool. Yeah, thank you, thank you.
00:28:30.800 - 00:29:56.370, Speaker A: Just a question for me, sometimes projects finish during the hackathon but sometimes they continue building on them. Do you have any plans to keep building on this afterwards? Yeah, I do because I wish to make it a complete DeFi portal right? Because I was working on other things as well to integrate into matters but I could not manage it in the time given right? But I'm planning on adding liquidation protection and other things like Avid Dashboard Two currently doesn't give liquidation options right to liquidate other users positions. So I'm planning to add that as well as well as protection liquidation protection bot which will monitor your position on off chain and protect you from liquidations. So I'm planning to make it a complete D five portal leverage is just starting with it. This is really great idea actually we built similar thing ath ten or last year with my team and yeah, this protection, this take profit and stop loss. This is really great thing. What do you think? What would you use as Oracles to protect people? Like you would like to use chainlink as similar what Ava is using? Or did you thought also about using on chain Oracles? Like uniswap oracles.
00:29:56.370 - 00:31:02.106, Speaker A: Maybe also one inch liquidity protocol Oracles? Yes. So two things about that. First, the monitoring will be off chain as in I'll be first monitoring off chain rates of prices like tokens as well and I've had some experience with chain link so I'll be integrating chain link as well and what else can be done is I'm trying to add other platforms as well so let's go with Maker. So Maker also has this on chain price feed, right? So I can fetch all of them, get an aggregate, have different algorithms working to protect anyone's position right? Before anyone else can liquidate so off chain on chain, both type of prices will be gathered by my bots. One last question from my side is the position tokenized position? Is the leveraged position tokenized? I didn't get that. Is it tokenized as in is it wrapped as a token? Like an ERC 20 token so that it can be transferred easily? Maybe as an NFT example as well? No, this does not include that. I don't think there's a need for that.
00:31:02.106 - 00:31:40.070, Speaker A: So what's happening is let's say I have 100 die and I wish to leverage ethereum right? So I have a current die. Let's say I can leverage four times, so I'll have 400 die worth of ethereum, right? So Avi generates Adai, so which can ultimately be sent to anyone without the need to wrapping it again. So let's say I leverage it, I'm getting Ada anyway, and I can send that to anyone else, right? Provided you do not borrow the entire thing out. If you have some safe margin, you can send that Ada to anyone else, so there's no need to wrap it again. All right, I think we're going to wrap there. Thanks, Krishna, for presenting. Really interesting project.
00:31:40.070 - 00:31:49.690, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Thanks, Krishna. Cool project. Thank you. Next up is not real. Oh. Jumping right into it.
00:31:49.690 - 00:32:34.420, Speaker A: If you're ready to go, go ahead. Hey, this is Notreal AI for the market make hackathon. And let me tell you about my project. So Notreal AI is an AI art market on ethereum. And the reason I'm building this is because I believe that the intersection of generative AI and Curation markets on Ethereum is going to be huge. Some of the problems with existing NFT markets is huge. Oversupply, lack of underlying value, foggy, price discovery, and of course, high fees.
00:32:34.420 - 00:33:19.690, Speaker A: So, let me show you what I built for the hackathon. This is the auction interface. So oh, cool. So you see, this is a 2D interpolator for the AI generated cats. And what we have here is a grid of NFTs that are being minted at a fixed rate. So there's a fixed supply and each one is available for only 24 hours. And I believe this structured method is a very good way of finding price discovery for these otherwise hard to price items.
00:33:19.690 - 00:33:55.050, Speaker A: So this is the interface. It's automatic, so for fast fees. Fast and cheap fees. And I'm also adding network agnostic transactions soon so that people won't even know that they're on layer two. That's the interface. And real quick, I just wanted to show you what some of the possibilities are. So these are Aigenerated paintings, these are AI generated cars.
00:33:55.050 - 00:34:33.590, Speaker A: And this next one is a custom model that I trained on various art that I found interesting on the internet. So those are some of the possibilities. To tell you a little bit more about it, it's built on Matic with network agnostic transactions. Going to be adding staking on. Aave. So that part of your purchase price is locked. And also, all the bids that are locked up are earning interest, which gives inherent value to the NFT.
00:34:33.590 - 00:35:24.970, Speaker A: And then also, the first purchaser of an NFT will get a 2% royalty on the item for life. Which means that the platform, it won't be taking fees, it will go to curators. So I just want to go with you down the rabbit hole for a second. What if NFTs become not just collectible items, but actual collectible storefronts? So when you collect an NFT, you also acquire a whole printing business. T shirt printing, poster printing. And imagine one day if generative AI is used to design a new 3D model for a chair, and that chair is printed for you and then shipped on demand. So that's the future, I imagine, marrying curation markets and price discovery with Generative AI.
00:35:24.970 - 00:36:13.978, Speaker A: So thank you very much. I post daily art on Twitter and Instagram, so make sure to follow me there. And thanks very much. Yeah, this is very interesting, especially the 50% of the proceeds being locked up and then staked on Ave. I'm not sure if I've seen anything like that before in NFT space. So that's really interesting because, like what you said, it gives some other inherent value to these NFTs other than just the art itself. And you mentioned that 2% royalty are all of the art.
00:36:13.978 - 00:37:36.002, Speaker A: Okay, I'm assuming all of the art or the Generative AI or AI generated images are created by you at the moment, but in the future, you're going to be allowing other artists to generate these images. And if so, are you going to provide the platform to make it easy for them to maybe train a model and then generate these images themselves? Or are you just assuming that people figure out how to do that on their own? If you're answering, you're muted. Sorry, can you hear me now? All right, so, yeah, one of the reasons I invested time in that 2D interpolator is one day I want this company to be building very easy tools for interacting with Generative AI and designing generative AI. So definitely building tools is one of the things I want to do. And turning it into a platform for other artists is also something I'd like to do. One day, shopify started off by just opening their own skiing snowboard store, and then they opened it as a platform. So I sort of see the path know, making it successful as a standalone store first and then making it into a cool.
00:37:36.002 - 00:38:27.720, Speaker A: Very cool. How did you build this? Did you clone a market place and fork a marketplace and use that? Yeah, so I forked known origin. So they had an MIT licensed marketplace with audited contracts and some front end. But everything that you saw on the front end there was custom, and then I had to do a lot of adjustments to it. So I'm very grateful for them as a base, but I added a lot to that. Yeah. I'm curious, what did you spend the most time on? Technically? So, during this hackathon, it was all the auction interface of that grid and then also basically hooking that up to the smart contracts and the various bid states and that sort of thing.
00:38:27.720 - 00:39:05.140, Speaker A: It would be interesting to take a look into AI files. But your repository is empty. Yeah, there's a lot of code involved, and I want to push it all up, but I have a whole bunch of. Kind of junk committed. I have to do a lot of cleaning in my Git repository, but yeah. Is there a particular part you'd like me to push up to view? Just push everything what you did so I can take a look. Okay.
00:39:05.140 - 00:40:06.640, Speaker A: Mmhmm. Any other questions? One thing you mentioned was that there's a limited number that are auctioned off per period. How did you come to that number? Auction? Yeah, it's kind of an arbitrary thing, but I know that CryptoKitties, when they were doing their initial sale, they were doing one every 15 minutes and I basically arbitrarily chose something a little bit less than that, like maybe one every 30 minutes or one every hour. And yeah, there isn't really a great way to decide on how much. I just didn't want it to be like, so much that it flooded the supply. Okay, yeah, I guess that makes sense. And you can tweak that later on, I'm guessing.
00:40:06.640 - 00:40:20.530, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Yeah, I think that's a pretty good overview of the project. Any other final comments? Awesome. Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it.
00:40:20.530 - 00:41:02.910, Speaker A: All right, so that was our fourth project and I think we had scheduled a break for judges if they want to. I'm going to just give it as an option. If you guys want to convene in that other Google meet just to chat about the last four projects. Do you want to do this? Yes or no? Judges may. All right, we can do one towards the halfway mark just so you guys can connect on projects and just share your thoughts. All right, next up is NF lend, and I think they're already promoted, so I'll let them get started right away. Hi.
00:41:02.910 - 00:41:34.490, Speaker A: Hey everybody. Hi guys. I am bright. Can't hear it, it's too quiet. Yeah, once you try that again with share the sound. Okay, sure. Also, I have a feeling that you're going to be hearing from the lawyers fairly quickly.
00:41:34.490 - 00:42:37.580, Speaker A: MMM, let me try like this. Lending. Hi everyone. I'm grateful to introduce you NLFL non fungible lending, which is our act with Peter, Zero, Dot and Adam. So what is NFL? Basically it's a market maker non custodial that allow borrowers to create borrow requests with their NFT as a collateral, which is our main innovation. And in the other part, lenders can lend and delegate part of their credit delegation to those borrower. So the advantage for the lender is that they can maintain exposure to their collateral benefit from additional yield paid by the borrower and they bear the risk on an NFC.
00:42:37.580 - 00:43:29.120, Speaker A: So we code and especially zero dots. So this is what we have done here. You have the main functions and for instance, NFT depositor will need to add the currency wants to borrow the amount. The Apr is ready to pay for that. And our design is quite efficient, we think. And to begin with, the lender that delegates the credit will need to pay the Apr on the Avery platform. So the RPR that is paid to him by the NFT, the borrower will need to be bigger than this Apr.
00:43:29.120 - 00:44:30.740, Speaker A: Let's move to the design part, which is one of our main focus to offer a decent user experience. So when you come on the dashboard, you can see what you need to pay the threshold also of your debt. For instance, to make sure you pay in high frequency, you can see what you have deposited so far. You can also just see the historic of what you have borrowed and for instance, yes, you can leverage also. So there you see the NFT you goat you got and the one you can use to get a loan. So for instance, I would like to loan this beautiful crypto kitty. So I estimate the value I want USDC I'm ready to pay like 15 Apr.
00:44:30.740 - 00:45:39.620, Speaker A: I know that also the lender will pay the Apr on Ave and I get my loan the threshold on the other part of the market you can see the NFT that are deposit and what are the proposal depth. So yes, you can see the summary and just select fixed RPR or variable, whatever you prefer. So as you can see, we move quick on the back, the front, but we still need to do the connection that we ASAP. It was an amazing project. We will continue working on it and we hope you like it and we'll use it. Thank you. Thank you.
00:45:39.620 - 00:46:10.384, Speaker A: How were you determining the estimated value for the NFT? So I'm going to take that question. So the estimated value for the NFT, this is actually a problem we ran into. Pretty big headache. Right. How do you get the appropriate price for an NFT? Right? Because that's something that's relatively illiquid. So we decided that instead of trying to tackle that problem, the actual amount that's input as estimated value is arbitrary, it's input by the borrower. However, the lender, it's on the lender to check the NFT to verify that it's a legitimate NFT.
00:46:10.384 - 00:46:54.832, Speaker A: You've got the address, you've got the openc, you've got everything. Yeah, that's what we meant when we said the lender does have to bear the risk of the NFT. I see. Gotcha. And how did you determine the differential between the Ave interest and the interest on the platform? Yeah, so we have actually gone through three designs of the smart contract. One of them actually built up, took the variable Apr from Ave because it was a bit more complicated to take the stable Apr because that's different for each person. But the variable is consistent and actually added a fixed coupon on top of that and that was cool.
00:46:54.832 - 00:47:24.072, Speaker A: But the problem is, well, other than being a little bit more gassy, it was a bit complicated for lenders or for borrowers because you wouldn't be able to know what your actual loan will be. Right. So we decided to take it simple for now. Obviously we can do that, but we decided to take it simple. The Apr is actually determined in the bar request. So it's on also the lender to check. Obviously you can choose to delegate stable if you want.
00:47:24.072 - 00:47:38.770, Speaker A: Right. We give that option. So that's essentially how we do it. It's not actually connected in this current iteration that we're working on. It's not connected to the Ave Apr, if that makes sense. Yeah, say that again. Sorry.
00:47:38.770 - 00:48:49.024, Speaker A: So essentially we're not taking into consideration the Apr on Ave, but lenders can delegate stable credit and get their own fixed Apr and make the difference between the borrower request Apr and the loan Apr or APY. One interesting thing might be like yield protocol have this thing where you could flash loan your thing into your maker CDP or Vault or whatever they call now into a yield thing. So potentially something to look at if you I do like Flash mean it might solve some of your problem there. Just like making it a stable thing. Actually not a bad idea. I think you mentioned as part of your closing slide that you still need to wire up the front and back ends. Anything besides that? Like what you want to pursue next? Well, on the back end side, at know there's a bunch of new projects in the NFT space, like Nftx for instance.
00:48:49.024 - 00:49:07.230, Speaker A: Right. And these are opening up a lot of new doors. Right. Because one of the biggest problems with this is it's more or less peer to peer, right? You have one borrower quest and one lender and DeFi likes pools of stuff. So we want to see if we can turn it into a pooled model eventually. Right. Longer term that might be really interesting.
00:49:07.230 - 00:49:42.088, Speaker A: Of course. Then there's the question of how do you determine the price? Oracle make sure it's not manipulatable, flash loans, whatever, everything but it's on the radar. Yeah, I mean that might be possible for semi fungible tokens like items in games or like Stone Jordan or something. And there's also assets that know currency backing them as well, like Abigailchis and stuff like that too. Right. There's a lot of options. Cool.
00:49:42.088 - 00:49:58.044, Speaker A: Good stuff guys. Thanks. Great stuff. Right on time. Thank you. Thanks guys. Next up we have the Watchful Eye and I think they're already here.
00:49:58.044 - 00:50:35.080, Speaker A: So they can start whenever they're ready. Everybody. Not sure I actually shared sound, so let me reshare. Just add a little bit, see how close you get. This is the Watchwell. I The Watchwell I allows Ave debt holders to set an automated stop loss based on the risk factors of their loans. The Watchwall I uses an Oracle that monitors the prices of the debt and collateral and compares it to the user defined stop loss.
00:50:35.080 - 00:51:39.020, Speaker A: Once the stop loss is reached, the Oracle calls upon the Watchy Eye to use an Ave Flash loan to repay the pre existing debt swap the collateral for the flash loaned asset on the one inch Dex and then repay the flash loan asset with the proceeds from the swap. To use a watchy, a user must first take out a loan on the Ave protocol. When the user comes to the dashboard, they can see their total debt in ETH, their total collateral in ETH, and their loan health factor or their Ave health factor, just for the viewer's sake. In our wallet, we have ten die, which we borrowed from Ave, and we have ten alink, which is our collateral on Ave. So first the user has to specify the details of the position that they hold on Ave. And as we showed a minute ago, the debt we have is in die. The collateral we have is a link, and we have ten die in debt.
00:51:39.020 - 00:52:40.540, Speaker A: And let's liquidate one a link if we cross our threshold, because that's worth about $25, and that'll cover the debt. And let's say our debt price limit for die is usually around one. Let's just put one and let's say that when the link goes below $28, which right now it is, we want to go ahead and liquidate. So let's configure the eye with the information that just adds that information to the watchful eye contract, confirm, then we have to approve of the eye's intervention, which just means that the smart contract can move around the collateral asset. So go ahead and confirm that transaction. So after we've approved and set up the watchful eye, we can actually go to the watchful eye contract and we can go and look at the watchful eye. Here's the watchful eye.
00:52:40.540 - 00:53:37.324, Speaker A: And it's not really human readable at the moment, but that's just the way that it comes back from the blockchain. So now that we see that the smart contract has the watchful eye that we created a second ago, we can check out the price Oracle. The price Oracle, as we said before, monitors the current price of the debt and asset and compares it to the watchful eyes set price limits. So let's go ahead and start that Oracle up. So we see that the Oracle pulled the watchful eye, saw that the price was below the limit, started to liquidate the position, and then successfully liquidated the position watched by the watchful eye. And now that the liquidation is finished, we can verify that that debt was paid off in our wallet. And would you look at that? We have one less alink and 25 more die.
00:53:37.324 - 00:54:24.604, Speaker A: So we paid off the initial debt and had a little bit of die left over. And aside from what we saw in the wallet, if you check the Aave user data as shown on the dashboard, we can see that that loan was in fact paid off. And this is the watchful eye. And the watchful eye is always watching. So you decided to build this to scratch your own itch. I'm guessing it was actually one of the one inch ideas. And both of us were brand new to doing any kind of development on Ethereum.
00:54:24.604 - 00:55:34.760, Speaker A: So it was kind of the lowest hanging fruit, I guess, 1 second from my side why you didn't use our API and used the old one split version. So we couldn't figure out how to make that because the Flash loan has to be finished in one transaction. Couldn't figure out how to and we asked around a little bit. Actually, at first we had a mock contract that acted like one inch to do the swap. But when we moved towards doing the actual swap on the forked main net, we couldn't figure out how to use the main API for one inch within our smart contract or how that would happen within one transaction. Okay, thanks. So in hindsight, this seems like a very obvious idea, using Flash loans to self liquidate.
00:55:34.760 - 00:56:12.414, Speaker A: Is there any instances of this actually happening right now in the network? Like people using Flash loans to self liquidate? I'm not sure of the name of the protocol, but I believe that there is a protocol that does it right now. I can't remember the name of it. Yeah. DeFi saver. Yeah. Thank you. You said you were new to ETH development.
00:56:12.414 - 00:56:50.722, Speaker A: Like, what were the challenges? What was surprising? Getting one inch API to work, of course. Yeah. Both of us are. We just started programming like a little over a year ago, two years ago. So we took what we've learned in the past two years, which is like building things incrementally. The hardest part was we had no clue how do we connect all of these different contracts or protocols together in our own contract. And that's why we started off incrementally building.
00:56:50.722 - 00:58:03.420, Speaker A: It not as if we built it first as we kind of set up a couple of mock contracts that would simulate the debt repayment and then the token swap. And then once we finished that, that was hard enough, as is figuring out how do we communicate with other contracts. Then we figured out how do we communicate with just one inch or how do we communicate with just ave? And we were able to do that in a modular kind of way because of how we built the code out initially. So it was just like going step by step and figuring out how do we swap out the mock contract that we made with the actual thing. And I would say that the hardest part of it was figuring out how to fork mainnet. And we had no clue that was a thing until last Wednesday. If you were to continue working on this, what are some of the features that you would have in the future? Well, first of all, right now the Oracle is just a script that we run.
00:58:03.420 - 00:59:05.894, Speaker A: It's just a centralized script. What we would like to do is take that Oracle and use chainlink to call a certain function every certain number of seconds. We haven't really thought about that that much. And given that certain field, given that we have a position that could be liquidated, then the Oracle will make that flash loan call, make that liquidation call. And also right now the Watchful Eye can only hold one person's or one user's information. And we'd like to extend that to allow as many people that want to use the application at once to use it. Yeah, I also like seeing every time somebody uses Scaffold ETH.
00:59:05.894 - 00:59:40.470, Speaker A: I'm sure Austin would be very appreciative. You should let him know your experience using it and any suggestions you might have because he's always looking for he loves hearing about people using it, especially during hackathons. Definitely reach out to him. I think that's it. We're going to wrap up with this team and move on to the next one. Thanks again, watchful Eye, great stuff. Your audio is a little shaky there, Evan.
00:59:40.470 - 01:00:12.820, Speaker A: All right, so next up we have, let's see Sonny. I'm not sure what the project name is, but I'm going to share the video. And then just after this project, we will take a ten minute break. This will be sort of our halfway mark for everybody. Sonny, just let me know if you are ready to go and I can share the video. Say hi Trent. I can hear you.
01:00:12.820 - 01:00:46.650, Speaker A: You can play the video. Yep, I can do that for you. Yeah. Evan, are you good? Looks like Evan is frozen. We'll wait a second for him to come back. Is my Internet still seem bad? Yeah, you could just turn off your video for now. Maybe that'll help a little bit.
01:00:46.650 - 01:01:19.124, Speaker A: All right, we're going to jump right into it. Hello. Hi, I'm Sunny. Radharia. So this is my market Mac Ether global submission. So I developed a calculator for the DeFi. So it measures the past historical performance of the DeFi platform.
01:01:19.124 - 01:02:03.264, Speaker A: So user can analyze the past data and so user can invest on the platform. So here, currently I used Graph protocol and using Thuggraph protocol, I used existing subgraph protocol of Shushi initially and then I will be integrate more protocols. So what happened in our project? So user can calculate the past historical data of any pair of any platform. Like for UNICEF, right. So currently here you can see three months back the data. So here you can see ROI chart in the percentage ROI chart in the dollars. So if user has invested $10,000.03
01:02:03.264 - 01:02:53.020, Speaker A: months back, so now he has 20,000. So if user has $10,000 back, so now he has 20,000. So total ROI would be 10 8%. And what is the asset change? So currently, initially user has invested here is something mistake. W should be here, USD should be upper side. So that was a minor mistake, but yeah, sorry. So what will the asset change? So currently user has invested ten e and the $5,000 worth of USDT, okay? Now, asset change was so now if you withdraw the LP position from the UNICEF, so now you will get six E 6.3
01:02:53.020 - 01:03:20.190, Speaker A: and the 10,000 worth of the amount of the USDT. So this is the asset change. So W ETH asset change goes minus and the USDT asset change goes plus and the total ROI goes plus. And what will be the total amount you will get 10,000 will be your profit. Okay, so this is the ROI chart in the percentage and dollars. Okay? That's it. And you can also add the date for any year.
01:03:20.190 - 01:03:31.516, Speaker A: Here. I add January. Okay? And submit. So now data will be changed. So as you can see, data is changed. Okay? Yeah. Here you can see chart is also changed.
01:03:31.516 - 01:04:34.396, Speaker A: So you can also do for the UNICEF. Okay, so now if you go the UNICEF platform, and if you do for like currently I add only two pairs each vidt each die. Okay? Now if you want to check for any other pair, so you have to paste over here pair address and currently have to set the date like one and that amount, whatever amount you want to invest, like 10,000 submit. So here it is saying like, if I invest $10,000 on 1st January 2021, then my profit would be like 15,000. Now, okay, I didn't invest it, but it just showed. So what will be the impermanent loss till now from the first January, what will be the SHN in WH percentage in the amount also? Currently, initially I invested six E. And yeah, here you can see the chart and the popular eight pair.
01:04:34.396 - 01:05:05.564, Speaker A: I have already calculated over here each USDT for $10,000 and three months back. And if you want to change over here so you can change from here also for ETH USDT. Okay. And for the Sushi swap also. Yeah. So platform basic motto is to if your user wants to analyze the past historical data and now from the past historical data if he wants to invest, so he can invest by analyzing the data. So that's it.
01:05:05.564 - 01:06:43.390, Speaker A: Thank you. Hi, Sonny. So the ROI does not include impermanent loss, right? I'm assuming because in the example that you gave, if the user held on to ETH and USD instead of supplying to uniswap, they would be making $5,000 more just because the price of ETH balloons so much versus supplying liquidity and you would be making basically 10,000 versus 15,000. Is that surfaced in the dashboard? Because I think they'll be what a lot of people are thinking about when they're thinking about supplying liquidity to AMMS. So is that surfaced? And if so, if not, then is there a way to see it on your platform? Sorry, ParisKim, I didn't get your question, but sorry, the question was okay, so because of impermanent loss in the example they gave about supplying Ethn USDT into uniswap in June, if you just held onto ETH and USDT, you would have $5,000 more of gains just because the price of ETH balloons so much. Right. Is that included in the ROI calculation today? If not, is there a way to see it in your website today? Yeah, currently it is showing the data.
01:06:43.390 - 01:07:26.148, Speaker A: I also show the impermanent loss. Like if you held the data, if you hold the $10,000 other than invest. So it is also showing the impermanent loss. If you go to the uniswap tab I already implemented, it is showing impermanent loss. But in meanwhile, I will also able to implement that. If I didn't invest it, then this much amount of I see. Okay.
01:07:26.148 - 01:08:20.910, Speaker A: So the input is always in USD. So the input is always in USD. And you can't specify maybe 50% USD, 50% ETH as a starting point? Yes. Currently input given USD, so it will automatically break the percentage 50 50. Okay. I have one question. Do you take into account the amount which you entered in the demo? Because if I put like 10 million in 5 million liquidity pool, so the APY is getting lower.
01:08:20.910 - 01:08:58.520, Speaker A: So are you taking into account this case? Yeah. You are saying if I add the more value other than $10,000, then the API may get. When I add the while testing, I'm going to add the more value instead $10,000. So it's showing me very weird. So now I didn't know that. Sorry. My English.
01:08:58.520 - 01:09:33.600, Speaker A: That okay. I got it. I guess you didn't take it into account, but it makes sense to do that. I guess we did. 2019, similar thing with calculating the APYs or Apr. It drops if you put more money into the pool because it performs maybe with the same performance. But there are more people who would like to get the money from the earnings.
01:09:33.600 - 01:09:52.890, Speaker A: But the idea is great. I like this. I would like to get in touch with you. If you like, just ping me on Telegram. Yeah, sure. I will try to connect you. I'll definitely try to connect you.
01:09:52.890 - 01:10:17.010, Speaker A: Awesome. Any final comments, questions? Yeah, awesome. Yeah, with a few more tweaks, I think this could be an incredibly useful tool to a lot of people. So thank you. I'm sorry my internet is not good and my English is not that good. So I was not able to explain better. Sorry for that.
01:10:17.010 - 01:10:38.680, Speaker A: No worries, man. No, we got it. You can see the potential of the project and what you submitted. So good job and looking forward to see if you keep working on it. Thank you. Yeah, sure. All right, we're going to move on to the next project.
01:10:38.680 - 01:22:43.160, Speaker A: Actually, I'm sorry. This is when we were going to take a quick ten minute break. Sorry for rug pulling, everybody, but we're going to take a quick break. Ten minutes just to reset and then back after the break, we will have Governor Alpha vote splitter, start us off. So ten minute break and then we will restart. All right, looks like we've got two or three judges left. Sergey, if you're here, just drop it in the chat or turn on your video and then we can get started.
01:22:43.160 - 01:23:04.202, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm here. I have some trouble with the camera. No, that's fine. That's all right. All right, so we're going to jump back into it. We're a little bit more than halfway through all the projects, so thank you to everybody who's presented so far. And we're just going to keep going with the next project, which is Governor Alpha vote.
01:23:04.202 - 01:24:23.192, Speaker A: And I think Monet supply is going to start us off here. All right, well, thanks for having us. I'm going to be presenting on behalf of the Tally Team. Let me just share my screen real quick. Sorry, bear with me one momentum. It sorry about this. Do you have any issues I can share? Hello, everyone.
01:24:23.192 - 01:25:13.952, Speaker A: My name is Denison Burke. This is Team Tally and we are presenting to you today our teammates, raph, Nate, Natasha and myself, and our Project Vote Splitting. So the impetus behind the project compound and ave governance use checkpoints to apportion voting power based on the tokens you hold at the time the proposal is started. But this prevents users from transferring or selling votes. Mid proposal and passive users also have no way of buying votes if they're not interested in voting in the protocol themselves. So our hackathon project is a mechanism to allow vote transfers during proposals, as well as selling non voting interests in governance tokens. Here's a diagram of how it works.
01:25:13.952 - 01:26:24.280, Speaker A: So the vote splitter contract at left side takes a governance token like comp from the top right and creates a Vault, which is the blue box in the middle. The user who created a vault locks their comp and they get back two things non fungible Vault token and as many fungible wrapped comp tokens as they put in comp tokens. The Vault has the power to vote and delegate on the underlying governance until it eventually expires. And the wrapped comp is used to close out the Vault to get back the underlying token. Now, I will share how you will use it. For example, let's say we have some comb and we will need to deposit, let's say, one for it to create a bolt. And then we will have the access to the Vault before they expire to vote with them using this NFT that we can sell in OpenSea or trade on other platforms.
01:26:24.280 - 01:27:30.574, Speaker A: Then what you're going to do is after it expires, after you decide to close it, you will have to send your approved to send back the wrap token to the Vault so you can get back your comp. So this has been our presentation. If you have any questions, our GitHub for both the front end and our protocol that we built on the back end is available and you can ask us any further information in our GitHub. Thank you. All right, any questions? Happy to go over with you guys. What inspired it? Anything in specific or sorry, you muted yourself. Yeah.
01:27:30.574 - 01:28:02.540, Speaker A: You're muted Monet. I have something going on in the background. Yeah. When you share your video, it autoplays the next video. It happens to me all the time for these sessions. Were you able to fix that? You're muted again, maybe purposely, maybe not. I don't know.
01:28:02.540 - 01:28:42.146, Speaker A: Okay. Really sorry about that. So, yeah, I got the sound to turn off now. I can hear you guys. Cool. So I think Evan's question was, what was the inspiration? I think the inspiration was just basically that a lot of holders prefer to kind of take a passive interest in these protocols. So if you're having a small amount of comp, you might not actually even have it be economical for you to vote.
01:28:42.146 - 01:29:47.942, Speaker A: It costs too much. And this gives passive users kind of a way to have economic interest in the protocol without having voting interest. Basically, when you put in comp and you get the NFT that votes, and then you get the wrapped comp that doesn't vote, the theory is that the wrapped comp, you'd be able to buy it at a discount as, like, a passive user, and then after the expiry date, you can turn it in for real comp. So it's like a way to earn yield on your comp rather than voting. How is this different from delegating to somebody in the compound system? I mean, I understand it's clearly different that you have a different architecture, but can't smaller users just delegate to larger proxies? They could. That's not incentivized per se. So they'd have to pay gas to delegate, and then their ten comp, or whatever it is, is just going to continue to be ten comp in perpetuity.
01:29:47.942 - 01:30:53.230, Speaker A: But theoretically, instead, they could buy the non voting comp from somebody that they support who's going to hold onto those votes, but for less than the price of the amount of wrapped comp they buy. So it's probably more for people who, you know, maybe even aren't interested in delegating. You know, they just purely want economic exposure. Um, yeah. Could you could you explain me again how people are incentivized to participate in the system? Yeah. So if you want to get more voting power, basically you would be minting an NFT and then selling the T comp off to somebody else so you can kind of get, like, leverage on your voting power. Presumably, the price people will be willing to pay for the non voting comp will be less.
01:30:53.230 - 01:32:05.560, Speaker A: So you end up having a premium that you're paying to get that extra voting power, and then that's the incentive for other people to purchase the non voting shares that if you buy wrapped comp that can't vote for a year for $0.90 on the dollar, then you just made, like, a 10% yield. It might be an interesting warning signal. Of an attack too. Right? Because you say you expect there to be a discount, but if there is not a discount, then there's a sign that people are all of a sudden valuing it more it could be, I think that it will make maybe governance rethink their strategies a little bit about preventing attacks. Because I think part of the security of comp based governance is that you can't move votes around after a proposal starts, but if it's in a transferable NFT that has a voting power, you could list it on OpenSea if there's like a contentious proposal and somebody could swoop them all up. So, yeah, I think it definitely raises some interesting questions.
01:32:05.560 - 01:32:45.314, Speaker A: Makes me think of renting hash power on nice hash. You can see spikes whenever there's a 51% attack or something. How much is the gas? I assume that's a decent bit of gas if I'm going to buy a bunch of voting power using an NFT. Yeah, I'm not certain what the gas is, but I'm sure it's considerable. It'd probably only be worthwhile for somebody to do it with like, 10,000 or more. Everything is considerable these days. Well, yeah.
01:32:45.314 - 01:33:19.950, Speaker A: Sorry for the AV issues earlier, though, and thanks for having us. No worries. Any final comments, Sergey? Yeah, it sounds great, the idea. So it could be maybe an additional market for the DeFi space and yeah, also a solution maybe to create attacks on governance. Thanks. Yeah. Combining this with flash loans may have some interesting outcomes.
01:33:19.950 - 01:34:04.430, Speaker A: All right, I think that's it for this team. Thank you guys for presenting. It's always nice to see a simple project that it's simple on the surface, but the implications are a little bit larger. So good job there. It'll be interesting to see what happens in the future, how people take this, or hopefully not too many attacks, but we'll see that's the way the crypto space goes. Yeah. We're going to move on to the next project that would be ENS Analytics with Sarvesh.
01:34:04.430 - 01:34:21.678, Speaker A: Yes. Hello, everyone. I'll just share my screen. Great. Is it visible? Yes. Hello everyone. I have built this ENS analytics dashboard.
01:34:21.678 - 01:35:00.474, Speaker A: So this dashboard does is it audible also? I think I stopped no, it was going okay. And help us drive the lifecycle of an ENS domain. So, going to the technical diagram. So I have these three main components for this project. I'm getting the data from ENS subgraph from the graph. I'm storing the data into postgres SQL, and I'm running complex SQL queries to build to generate the data set that I require for the charts. And at the end, I have the dashboard, which runs on this postgres SQL database dashboard to quickly go to the dashboard feature.
01:35:00.474 - 01:35:25.666, Speaker A: So I have four main features on the dashboard. The top level is aggregation metrics. So at the top, I have total number of ans domains available in the ethereum. Then I have two monthly trend charts. So this shows number of new ans domain registered compared to the last one. Similarly, number of domains getting expired this month compared to the last one. This is aggregation metrics.
01:35:25.666 - 01:36:00.180, Speaker A: The second chart is about funnel chart. This is interesting because this chart help us understand what is the dominance of owner in terms of domain ownership. So, let's say I as an owner in the ENS system, how many domains I own. So, funnel chart explains the percentage of owners actually dominate the ownership of ENS domains. Similarly, I have the chart for domain lifecycle of any ENS domain. And we can also filter the dashboard based on domain name and owner's name. Let's quickly go through the dashboard and see a quick demo on that.
01:36:00.180 - 01:36:23.254, Speaker A: So, here is the dashboard. So it's hosted on the web. And we have loading. We have a couple of charts here. So starting from the left side, we have this ETH total number. We have a chart which states number of domains exist from the ethereum blockchain. Then we have this trend charts.
01:36:23.254 - 01:36:51.780, Speaker A: It tells last month we have five one private new domain registration, this month 2576. That's a 50% decline from last month. Similarly, we have another trend chart which says that last month a domain expiry was 2262. This month it's 1846. Yeah, the second chart is funnel analytics. So it tells the number of domains owned by the owners. So, total 18,613 owners own two plus domains in the system.
01:36:51.780 - 01:37:28.574, Speaker A: Now, out of this 47%, which is 88, five owns the four plus domains. So on the rightmost side of the chart, these are the big whales in the system. So these are like 784 such owners who own 64 plus domains. So this chart help us see the domain distribution among them, things like that. So here we have Pagination, so we can see all the domains available. Now we also have this filter where we can search any of the domain that we want. I know one domain that I can search.
01:37:28.574 - 01:38:03.900, Speaker A: So I have this depth period ETH domain. I added a filter on that. I can see the depth period ETH domain was registered at this block number and it was again reduced at this block number. So similarly, we can do filter on the owner's address, so we can do zero X any address. It's also not a complete. So here it shows all the addresses we can actually select and add. So, this address has this domain, it has this event.
01:38:03.900 - 01:38:49.830, Speaker A: We also have this GitHub repository where we have documented everything. So all the charts that we have, and also the Fish subgraph entities we are taking data from, and the postgres tables we are storing data and the SQL queries around the same. Yeah, that's it for the demo set. Very cool. I'm curious if you had a chance to talk with ENS at all. Yes, actually, I built this dashboard by discussing with them, so they already had some sort of initial dashboard that they were using, but they do not have something which can tell them that. What is the dominance of any owner in the uns system.
01:38:49.830 - 01:39:37.814, Speaker A: So identifying the big wells and the small wells in the system, things like that. And also they wanted to track the ENS lifecycle. They didn't have that feature yet, so that's why I built that. Maybe I might just but do you support subdomains? Do you have any thoughts about doing that? Yeah, so currently current dashboard just supports the top level domain, but I have all the data set that is required, so I need to put them into the charts. That's next steps. What would you say is the number one interesting thing that you learned about building this? Yeah, what I learned majorly here is I was looking into multiple projects. One inch was one of them.
01:39:37.814 - 01:40:37.500, Speaker A: Aave was there, ENS was there. So I was looking into those analytics metrics that I can see, and those are common to all of this DeFi and all the DApps across the ethereum. And is there something I can build? A sort of framework or platform which could be used for all of these platforms and see these funnel charts or maybe, let's say for our it's a user retention chart, right? So how many users are coming and taking Flash loan every month or every year, every quarter, things like that? With this project, I got that kind of ideas and that kind of learning from my side. I can say it's great to have such tools. Also, for ans for discovery, it's like Explorer, right? And a more external dashboard. Yeah, I like this idea. Thank you.
01:40:37.500 - 01:41:03.810, Speaker A: All right, any comments from Pete? Otherwise, we can wrap up. Thanks for presenting, Sarvesh. Yeah, I already made a comment, but yeah. Oh, sorry. I must have missed it. Cool. Congrats, Nikash.
01:41:03.810 - 01:41:39.890, Speaker A: Thank you. Good job. Yeah, thanks. All right, the next project is APY In, and they can start whenever they're ready. Hi. Hello and welcome to this APY in Presentation. What is APY in you're asking? Basically, it is a formal machine.
01:41:39.890 - 01:42:46.150, Speaker A: You come to the site, you connect your wallet, we scan it for should I be hearing audio? I can't hear the sound either. How about now? Why don't you try to reshare but with the sound again? Yes. It's a little checkbox in the bottom left. Pretty sure I did that, but Zoom is acting weird today. Let me try it again. Now I can't if you're having issues, I can share it for you. Let me try this.
01:42:46.150 - 01:43:14.220, Speaker A: So now I can't see. I can't get it back. Okay. There we go. Can you hear it now? Hello and welcome to this APY in Presentation. Is that fine? It's pretty quiet. What is APY? Is that good? Yeah, that's fine.
01:43:14.220 - 01:44:26.980, Speaker A: Okay. Hello and welcome to this APY in Presentation. What is APY in you're asking? Basically, it is a formal machine. You come to the site, you connect your wallet, we scan it for idle assets, and we calculate and display how much US dollar you would have earned if this asset was sitting in an Ava lending pool instead of just sitting on your wallet. Why did we choose to do that? So while the other site is really nice and easy to use, the amount of historical data for how the different pools have performed in the past is limited. So you see here there is a 30 day average that I think was recently added, and you have some data for the present day over here, but that's it. So we knew that we wanted to do something with historical APY and we decided to cater to the DeFi newcomers as a DeFi noob, you are overwhelmed with all this new terminology and different ways to make or lose money.
01:44:26.980 - 01:45:09.220, Speaker A: So we thought that a good first step would be to see some hard numbers that were calculated based on your wallet data. And then based on that, you can decide if you want to ape in or chicken out. Let's see what that looks like. Over here, we got the different assets that have been idle in your wallet. Here we have the APY that you would have enjoyed if these assets were on Ava. And here we have the return in USD based on these numbers. Then you can click on this link and you get redirected to the Ava lending pool.
01:45:09.220 - 01:46:49.030, Speaker A: Now, if you click on this plus sign, you will see this chart that shows the USD with Ava for this certain asset and USD without Ava. You will notice that unless you've been holding a big amount of token for a long time, this chart doesn't look that impressive. So in the end, they turned out to be a product for Wales, but that's also fine. The bottom line is we had a lot of fun developing that, gathered a lot of experience on how to get the data and calculate the historical APY, and we will definitely use that experience in new projects. Thank you for your time and your attention. Have a great day. So, yeah, we can just move to judge questions, and the obvious one is what inspired it? What made you decide to do this? Yeah, so as I said, the video was just a good way to show people how much money they would have made to try to lure them in, basically into getting into the DeFi world.
01:46:49.030 - 01:47:17.208, Speaker A: Like, you had a friend that you wanted to convince, so you figured, like, hey, I'll make a site for them. Exactly. That's a plan. Yeah. That's a cool use case, actually. Thanks. It'd be interesting if you also displayed how much it costs in gas to ape into these lending pools.
01:47:17.208 - 01:48:30.310, Speaker A: And also, what was the hardest thing that you encountered? What was the most difficult task when you're building this? It was actually getting the data from the graph because the subgraph that we chose to use there were some inconsistencies. So I think in March to USD price was changed to USD to ETH or the other way around. So that was figured it out but it was kind of tricky to figure out and yeah, otherwise went pretty smoothly. One question from my side. So you write here that you sent notifications via SMS and email. Did you implement SMS? No, I don't think you is that the right project? Um, I guess yes. Sure.
01:48:30.310 - 01:49:09.360, Speaker A: Okay. Maybe a feature for the future SMS notifications. Okay, we'll get on that. Actually. Yeah, you're right, I opened the wrong yeah, all good. So actually another feature that takes into account the gas prices would be the break even. So in how much time you would break even depending on today's gas prices.
01:49:09.360 - 01:49:33.748, Speaker A: But again with today's gas prices, unless you're a whale, this is going to take a long time. So yeah, cool. Neat project. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for presenting.
01:49:33.748 - 01:50:28.372, Speaker A: We're going to move on to the next project and that would be Yaka and you can start whenever you are ready to go. Hello there. Hey David. Yeah, here it I don't think you shared your sound properly. Sorry. Why don't you retry it and share your sound now? Yeah. In the bottom left there's a checkbox.
01:50:28.372 - 01:51:20.692, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay now thank you for your time. First of all, let me introduce to you our small team that has been working together for the past weeks. David, myself as a financial product manager, alex, our lovely smart contract developer and Nico as our DeFi innovation advisor. We have been building an MVP of what we call interest as a service platform and what we think is the first product we can offer aiming to help the masses to start using. Finally ave from an easy to use app where we call no lost investing. So our product can be simplified in three easy steps.
01:51:20.692 - 01:52:17.660, Speaker A: So we have the user depositing into the Yaka finance platform and picks a strategy from lower to higher yields and risk of course then from the interest generated our smart contract allocates the service the user had chosen. So for example, the strategies can be keep compounding the interest. That's an easy one. But we'll keep going until the user decides reinvesting the interest into indexes like DPI for example or Nftx or whatever. But in this case using a dollar cost average strategy. So we keep buying every week for the user or even that could be very interesting. We could actually be a getaway of paying subscription services from the interest generated from abe.
01:52:17.660 - 01:52:51.136, Speaker A: Well, despite of the lack of time we've been able to deploy a small part of what we aim to build. Let me show you. Actually Alex going to show you how it works. Here we have our simple front end. First of all we created an ERC 20 token called yakadai. This token value will be equal to a die. So if the user deposits ten dies, we will give him back ten yakadais.
01:52:51.136 - 01:53:48.036, Speaker A: As you can see here, we have two boxes. The first one in which we can deposit our dai in the system, and in return we will receive the same amount in yakadais. The second box is used to deposit the yakadais in order to retrieve the die. The yakadais will be minted when the user deposits the dice and will be burned when the user deposits the yakadais into our platform. And here you can see that we have 19 dies and 110 yakadais into our wallet. To do this presentation, we will use the MetaMask and well, we will provide the system with ten dice. First of all, we need to confirm the approval and then the transaction to the smart contract.
01:53:48.036 - 01:54:38.548, Speaker A: As you can see here, the amount of our wallet refreshed. And now we have 80 dies and 120 yakadais. And the system has ten dies. These dies that the system has will be sent every day to Ave in order to earn an APY. This part is not working yet because we had some troubles with the deployment of the Ave in our testnet. Just to finish, like everyone is saying, well, the hardest thing to find in DeFi is to find an easy user experience, right? To capture the newcomers, the masses. So we aim to keep building this product believing this is the tool for this newcomers and to finally get them to the crypto ecosystem.
01:54:38.548 - 01:55:19.700, Speaker A: So thank you for your time. We are ready for your questions. Thank you. So I hate to be that guy, but PayPal and credit cards on there. How are you going to deal with chargebacks? Actually, yeah, that's a good question. Right? If you want the adoption, it's actually taken from so and if we think that, of course, are they going to have the banking license and they can be actually on ramp, so why not, right? I mean, the adoption has to be from this side. I guess it's taken from Taurus.
01:55:19.700 - 01:56:02.980, Speaker A: The answer is you're separating your concerns. You're not actually doing onboarding or on ramping, right? No. Leaving that to Taurus. Okay, that makes sense. Of course, we know that we started pretty late and the beginning, of course we will keep building it, but the idea is actually this, right? So we learned that there's a lot of innovation around here. We think that the adoption have to be the other side and we want to focus from here. Got you from my side.
01:56:02.980 - 01:56:47.490, Speaker A: I can say the idea is great. Once we implemented all the lending and the interest, what we got we used for paying for gas costs, for transfers of the GDI token. You have kind of built a framework where you can just put everything behind that, right? Yeah, we said that actually. Like the RDI model, right? We can just send that to wherever we want. Even we can actually use it for payments, I guess. So if we focus that, we have deposit the 1000 and with that we get enough to pay next week. So it goes there.
01:56:47.490 - 01:57:34.812, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. So in the deck, you mentioned that the users can pick a strategy more risky or less risky. But in the actual demo, I think I saw just like a way to convert Dai to Yakadai. So how are people choosing their strategy? Yeah, that would be of course in the front after depositing, but yeah, it should be you choose one strategy, so it's strategy and then later you choose where you want to allocate that. Right. So it's one deposited.
01:57:34.812 - 01:58:28.050, Speaker A: You decide in which smart contract is going to be actually sent at Jagadai to Adai or CDAI or wherever. Makes sense. Okay, I see. Okay. I thought the echodite like the value of Ecadai changes based on the strategy, changes based traits that are placed as part of the ecosystem. Well, that would be just the certification that you have deposited back to is that Jakada is going to be compared to Adai or Sedai or Dai or UDC or wherever that's going to get the interest related to the strategy. Okay, thank you.
01:58:28.050 - 01:58:49.592, Speaker A: All right, I think that's time for this project. Thanks for presenting, David. Thank you so much for your time, guys. Thank you. Thank you. All right, so we have two projects left, and I know Sergey has something which may prevent him from seeing the last project. But that's okay.
01:58:49.592 - 02:00:30.760, Speaker A: If he drops early, we'll just do the last project separately. But next up is Jerome. Jerome, you can start whenever you're ready. You're muted Jerome, by the way. So this project, it's a bit continuous. What I was doing from the last ethereum Icato up the volume a little, was to develop a library from scratch that is able to interact with the blockchain in C using kind of international programming language that makes a possibility after to have more simple interface for the end user to write C programming. The goal is to be able to make low level programs that will insert in high security device hardware security module or HSM key as well key with secure element to be sure that the data and the processing that is linked to the blockchain cannot be act by anybody.
02:00:30.760 - 02:01:33.020, Speaker A: So last time I stopped sending transaction, I was not able to sign correctly the transaction. So now see that I work on this. So now transactions are working and I work also on smart contract call. So the idea was to be able to get the right data to be able to call smart contracts. It has taken more time than expected, but make it work with AAV smart contract. So to show that's my code, you can see it's more like drag and drop blocks, code style. When you make create a program, it compiles a program with the safe code and when you execute it runs the program.
02:01:33.020 - 02:03:24.580, Speaker A: So in this case it is running two smart contracts called from AAV. So one is deposit and another one is withdrawal. So here's the day of the transaction and if we go to this transaction we see that calls the deposit method with the right parameters. So it kind of seems trivial with JavaScript application that's more secret that can be embedded in Lululevel computer if I go to AAV data. So the ID store user antifa is quite simple, it's still a bit complicated but more time to simplify it. For example, you get two smart contract calls. One you get the address of the smart contract, the gas, maximum amount of gas that you want to spend, the function that you are calling, the amount of ethereum that you are sending and the different value that you have called that will be your wallet and the one is not used and same for the withdrawal, same address withdraw and different parameter for the wallet.
02:03:24.580 - 02:04:06.016, Speaker A: Yeah, I didn't have all the time to finish what I wanted, but I think I will need another cat on to make something really useful for the end user for this. Thank you. You said you didn't have time to finish everything you wanted. What's next? I assume you're going to keep working on it at the next ETH global hackathon or at East Denver or something like that. What's next? Yeah, we'll try to advance a bit on East Denver. The idea is to generate automatically the block from the smart contract abi. So I have already the processing and after I will make the block.
02:04:06.016 - 02:05:35.760, Speaker A: So you just put different values that correspond to the smart contract call but that make in a more automatic way for developer to unbold the tools quite quickly. So can you also make transactions or can you only do ETH calls? And also another question that I have is you mentioned it could be useful in embedded devices and things like that. What are some of the use cases what are some of the interesting use cases you've thought of that could take advantage of this? Okay, so yes, I can do anything like transaction or contract call the things that I want to do it's to be able to have the full program running inside the secure element. For example, you have a ledger key and you just design your code, put the code in your leisure key and everything will be run inside the ledger. So there is no interaction with the computer and there is no act possible between and same for the server. I'm working this more long time for my company using HSM so hardware security module, the servers that are used by banks but they are quite low level and the idea is to use them to embedded some ethereum code that be able to process batches without the intervention of the user or anything external. I have one question.
02:05:35.760 - 02:06:46.820, Speaker A: So what I asked that you wrote everything from scratch in C, right? Yeah, I use OpenSSL library from C and I add some function to match with Ethereum because there is a bit of different crypto that the standard ones crypto function use and that was at the last academy, but last Ethereum academy. I didn't finish this because I have some problem signing and my signature was not good all the time. So now it's stable and I added the ability to call smart contract. Cool. Can you push your code maybe so it's possible to read it on GitHub? Because there's nothing pushed. I can put the end user code, but the wool code it's thousand and thousand lines of code so I don't really know which part of the code you want to have. What you wrote on hackathon? Yeah.
02:06:46.820 - 02:07:19.040, Speaker A: Okay. It's kind of XML and the editor is not released publicly. Or maybe I can give you access to my editor that make more sense for you, so you can have a look to it. Just share what you can share. Would like to take a look? Sounds great. Ideas like have also implementation for HSMs so it runs more secure. Yeah, cool.
02:07:19.040 - 02:07:57.340, Speaker A: Okay, sorry. So can I push how I do it? I push to use the URL or how can we push you set a repository here? GitHub? Yeah, just push what you can push like C code maybe, I don't know, so it won't be too friendly to read. But yeah, I can push it. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I do it right. Cool, thank you. Very cool.
02:07:57.340 - 02:08:24.190, Speaker A: Okay, thanks. Sergey, are you going to drop or do you want to just push through this last project? I have still six minutes, it's not enough. We can just at least do the presentation. Morgan, if you want to just start. Yeah, cool drum. Thanks. See you next.
02:08:24.190 - 02:09:20.760, Speaker A: Bye. It, can you hear me now? I hear you. Okay, great. Take back attention contribute to a future homestead with others. The goal is to optimize wellbeing in new city developments. The problem is to prevent crypto attention depletion and DeFi by building a credit network for builders with land developments and users with biofeedback data to align incentives towards positive nature utilization. The solution is planetary government software for building new land development institutions via globally pooled credit.
02:09:20.760 - 02:10:07.430, Speaker A: Ethereum holds a unique balance between attention or spirit and matter in the traditional world, creating a type of dark matter potential that can confer new rapid development in projects to unlock and redistribute. Focus on embedding context back from the intention in living into growing land and reconnecting with nature under economic stasis like the COVID Pandemic. Possible planetary redistribution begets a possibility for people to shift to local scopes. Gov ten has an embedded biofeedback put option as an intention takeback mechanism to facilitate the Gov. Ten NFT warrant over a period of time. A portion of escrow funds can be used to purchase an NFT representing biofeedback data, also called spectrum demand option. By attempting to create a new medium neuroeconomies might form whereby biographic coupons represent future cognitive value for institutions and researchers.
02:10:07.430 - 02:11:07.160, Speaker A: It becomes possible to form new land metrics and bioregionalism projects by focusing on a cross nation alternate funding model. To put another way, you can consider it like staking memories in a place before you've arrived. By embedding the context of biowellbeing data in a Gov ten loan repayment, positive incentives become aligned in new ways so that we might explore a new geopolitical rotation possibility the Gov Ten UI uses three JS to be used as an inhome hologram. Possible risks include illicit data, unpaid loans, single project takeover which has possible prevention mechanisms using gov ten. You can either go to a place as a user or build as a builder. You can build for certain pools decided by the user's biofeedback. You can then create an offchain listing by allowing ave the approval of the credit amount, uploading files related to the project, and choosing the location for such project.
02:11:07.160 - 02:12:25.380, Speaker A: You are then given the option to have a portion of the repayment done via spectrum demand option which represents future cognitive biofeedback data. After signing the transaction, payment of the portion of the funds are escrowed in the contract. As a user or delegator, you can first choose a biopool that appeals to you from your profile. You can then go and choose a project you want to deposit funds into and delegate credit to it. As a final step, you can review the loan and sign your data key saved on chain for the biofeedback data and at this .2 NFTs would be minted to you biodata and another warrant for the project access. Once your pool in place has been decided, you can then participate in data sharing rituals in virtual mindfulness rooms by revealing your swarm to the developer pool and your biofeedback data.
02:12:25.380 - 02:13:51.088, Speaker A: After this point, the borrowers or the developers can deem the key from the blockchain and plug into the swarm pool stream. They can have the data sold to research institutions and possibly those that are building such projects. Participants can be comfortably included by using a headset fitted to a pair of glasses or used during any other activity. Hi. Yeah, maybe, I don't know, I'm dumb or something, but I was hearing lots of terminologies that I'm not familiar with, like cognitive biofeedback data or like swarm revealing or biological well being. Could you give an elevator pitch that summarizes what it is? Can you explain like on five, please? Sure. So you can think of it like if you're moving to a place where a land developer is building a house for you, you can repay that person in the option of using biofeedback data.
02:13:51.088 - 02:15:05.546, Speaker A: Or you can think of it like if you're extracting data from part of your, let's say, medical bills or something like that, you can contribute. That data to be sold to the developers that are building the place that you want to be living into. Okay, go ahead. What does biofeedback data mean? Yeah, so it represents the data that you get from taking measurements from, let's say, your body or some type of portion of your biology. So like my Aura ring or my Fitbit or my Apple Watch or I'm sticking it in the yeah, right now I'm just using Dat project, but in the future I would probably use IPFS. Right now it's just stored locally on the computer. And the purpose that I think that a way to on ramp users is to be more mindful of the community and thinking about the data being shared is a portion of you being a contributor to that data.
02:15:05.546 - 02:16:29.042, Speaker A: So it's not just stored globally, but the only way to access that data is to be a portion of someone else's pool. Okay, so in the developer thing example, I buy a house. Part of the agreement is that they get access to my data pooled with everybody else in the development for a couple of years. It could be a couple of years, could be just a window that could be set up as the portion of what's agreed upon at the start of the time. And is the idea that the developer can then sell my data and that's the remunerative part, or is it that they understand how I'm using it? Yeah, the idea is that the developer is more of like an institution builder or some type of research focused developer, and they would be buying that at sort of a chain linked Oracle price of the NFT representation. So it would be less traditional developers and more people focusing on new types of communities or new types of institutions in certain areas. I don't want to say charter city because that's not necessarily the focus.
02:16:29.042 - 02:17:31.062, Speaker A: The focus is on something a little bit in between, something that optimizes for well being. Okay, so it's sort of like analytics for the developers. Sure. Like in developing the community sorry, what was the last question? Yeah, it's analytics to measure how well they did in terms of providing well being to the residents of a development in the time in which they're not living in the place. So if they haven't moved there yet, the developers want to make sure that the people moving to this place have positive well being or are, let's say, trying to focus on that, and they can provide metrics to represent that as a coupon for purchase at a later point. I see. Okay, cool.
02:17:31.062 - 02:18:28.662, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super futuristic. Yeah. My only comment is it seems like you're overlapping or you're bringing together a lot of different domains. So I'm curious how you got engaged with all these different areas and what inspired you to bring these all together, like some personal experience or past job experience? I would say that a lot of the hackathons along the way from East Global has been pretty useful. Then with this project, I started thinking about how Aave loans can be incorporated into new type of local economies with types of stable currency. And then I couldn't solve the problem without using some type of advanced reputation system to align the incentives between the borrows and the unclateralized loans of the lenders. So I thought that it would be an interesting thing to try to tie that back into a positive feedback loop.
02:18:28.662 - 02:19:03.880, Speaker A: Thinking about the wellness of people moving to a place. Yeah, it was definitely projects along the way. And then a project that's close to me is trying to match sort of like a futuristic side with a natural well being side. Got you. Cool. That's good to know that you've engaged with the hackathons and that was part of your process getting to this point, so I'm happy to have played a part in that. Thank you very much.
02:19:03.880 - 02:19:15.394, Speaker A: I think we can wrap there. Thank you, Morgan, for presenting. Thank you. Cheers. Morgan. So, yeah, that's it. I want to thank everybody who's presented.
02:19:15.394 - 02:20:04.018, Speaker A: It looks like we don't really have anybody who stuck around besides the people who just presented, but thanks to Pete, Evan, and Sergey, sergey had to drop for this last project, but I'm sure he'll be looking into the project profile and he'll reach out with any questions. So, yeah, this was session eight. Bunch of good projects. I want to remind everybody that the finale will be Thursday from twelve to 230 Eastern. So we'll be reviewing all of the projects collectively, all the judging scores, and then reach out to any of the projects that ranked in the top tier, and then you'll present again to the finalist panel. That's all I've got. Thanks again to the judges and everybody who helped put the hackathon together, all our sponsors.
02:20:04.018 - 02:20:19.700, Speaker A: It's been a really great month of hacking building, stuff like that, and that's it. We'll see you in the discord or at the finale if you're joining us there. See you guys. Bye.
