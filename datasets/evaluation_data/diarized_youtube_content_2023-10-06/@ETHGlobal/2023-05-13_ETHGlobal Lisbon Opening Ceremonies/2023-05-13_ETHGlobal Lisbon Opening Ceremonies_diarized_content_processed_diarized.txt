00:09:25.080 - 00:09:47.008, Speaker A: Good evening, everybody. How are you all doing? Good. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETHGlobal and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to ETHGlobal. Lisbon can't wait to get started. This is not a conference. If you've been to an ETH Global hackathon, well, if you've been to an E Global event, you'll know that this is a hackathon.
00:09:47.008 - 00:10:26.096, Speaker A: And what makes us different is our focus on a couple of key things. Our goal and our mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem. And we do this by running a lot of amazing developer focused hackathons. What makes these events unique are these three things. Our focus is on builders and builders only. These are opportunities for you to learn, get help and grow as individuals. Whether you want to learn how to be a better developer, whether it's front end, back end, full stack, solidity, anything, you name it, we want to be there to help you get there and give you the resources you need to be successful.
00:10:26.096 - 00:11:19.412, Speaker A: And we really believe that showing is way more important than telling, which means anything that you do today will be focused on a demo and not a PowerPoint, because that's the code we want to see, not just something we want to hear you talk about, on what you think is interesting. And this is something we've been doing for the last five years. We've been to all different continents, whether it's Argentina, Africa, North America, Asia, waterloo, where we all started. This was London just before COVID We got back last year with Amsterdam, Mexico and South America. San Francisco in India last fall and just a month ago in Tokyo. And I'm super excited to be bringing ETH Global hackathons here in Lisbon. This is our first event in Portugal and we were absolutely blown away by the excitement and the interest that we got from everybody here.
00:11:19.412 - 00:12:11.536, Speaker A: There are over 975 attendees in this building this weekend, and that's amazing. From that, 650 of these are hackers who are coming in from 51 different countries and about 30% of them are brand new to Web Three. How do we define what's new to Web Three? We define this as existing developers who are interested in trying what they can do in web3 for the first time coming in from web two. So these are already existing designers, engineers who are currently thinking about what they should be looking at in web3. So I can't wait for all of them to feel welcome and get a sense of our community. We put everybody on a map to see where people are coming in from and we have people from six different continents here, just here this weekend, and so many from Europe and UK. On top of all of those hackers, we have 176 ecosystem builders.
00:12:11.536 - 00:12:40.512, Speaker A: These are amazing partners. And the engineers and designers and product managers from all of the protocols you've heard of and 23 technical mentors who are here. Twenty four seven to help you get the help you need to get your project to the finish line. On top of that, all of that already happened a few hours ago. We're doing 17 workshops which are on different protocols. And because this is not a hackathon conference, this is a hackathon or only five talks which happened earlier today. So focus is very much on building.
00:12:40.512 - 00:13:21.816, Speaker A: Want to give you all the time you need to make something that you're excited about happen and come to life by Sunday. And on top of all of that, over $275,000 in prizes. And we're going to be talking about all those prizes and everything you can win just in a few minutes. And 24 incredible partners who are here making this event what it is and there to help you succeed. So I want to give a quick shout out to all of these companies. So please join me in thanking with a massive round of applause to one inch WorldCoin optimism. Polygon gnosis chain airstack apecoin Zkbob fuel Labs safe ethereum foundation cartesi uma MetaMask filecoin.
00:13:21.816 - 00:14:02.680, Speaker A: Virtual machine lens protocol. Uniswap foundation. The graph ave Grant style mantle chainlink sysmo scroll and neon foundation. All these companies are giving amazing prizes and they're here to help you really understand what you can do to save yourself a lot of time in building what you're going to be building, and just learn about cool projects that are up and coming in the space. So I'm going to keep this very small in terms of focusing on a few things that we want to get across for all of you about this weekend. So I want to talk about what the venue and everything looks like we have planned for you this weekend, how you can get all the help, all the prizes, workshops and talks, anything about team formations. A lot of you are still looking for ideas and how judging is going to work on Sunday.
00:14:02.680 - 00:14:46.724, Speaker A: So first things first, do not use WiFi hotspots. We're trying to make sure that the internet is going to work in this middle part. That's where most of the signal noise comes from because it's a massive area and you see a lot of bouncing and echo. And the way all the routers work is they interfere with each other and they're automatically set to fight each other on the waves, trying to increase their band frequency. Which means the second you turn on your WiFi because you think the Internet is slow, you make it worse, because now the internet has to compensate for other frequency in there. I can talk to you about all the technical stuff, too, but just don't turn your WiFi hotspots on because you end up making it worse for everybody in that nearby radius. We're going to be keeping everything consistent.
00:14:46.724 - 00:15:11.328, Speaker A: I did a speed check just five minutes before this thing. It was 300 down. So please be assured that we're taking WiFi very seriously. Now let's talk about security. Everyone must have their wristband and their badges on them at all times. If you lose your wristband, we will not be issuing another one to you. It's fine if you misplace your badge, that's all right, we can print another one.
00:15:11.328 - 00:15:42.712, Speaker A: But if you miss that, if you cut this off tonight or some other thing happens and you can't find it, that does mean that you will not be allowed back into the building. Want to make sure that everybody feels safe. Their stuff is safe here, and everybody's following the same rules. So please make sure that you don't lose your wristband on top of all that. Don't leave your belongings unattended. This event in this venue is open 24/7. We are going to not be responsible if you lose anything or if you misplace anything.
00:15:42.712 - 00:16:08.076, Speaker A: There will be a lost and found in case things come up, but please make sure that you keep all of your valuables with you at all times. Now let's quickly talk about all the stuff that we have planned and what this venue looks like. There are two floors here, the ground floor where you are sitting right now. This is where we're going to be talking today and on Sunday for all the closing ceremonies. All the hacking stuff is here. At the back of this room is where the food and the catering is. On the sides of all the walls.
00:16:08.076 - 00:16:31.012, Speaker A: That's where our partners are. And if you want to relax, there's a really nice lounge in there by cartesi. You can check that out in that corner, which is to my left and your right. And that brings us to the second floor. There's more hacking spots on the second floor as well. And that's where also the workshop rooms are. Nothing changes for the whole weekend with the exception of one small thing on Sunday.
00:16:31.012 - 00:16:56.352, Speaker A: On Sunday, where the workshop rooms were is where judging will happen. So nothing else for hackers. But on Sunday you'll be all going upstairs and that's where you'll be presenting your projects to our judges. And I'll talk about that more in a second. We also have a lot of late night snacks, so we just did dinner, but in about 3 hours we're going to be serving more food. So that's going to happen at midnight today and tomorrow. There's a massive photo booth here.
00:16:56.352 - 00:17:14.240, Speaker A: You can take a digital photo and get a selfie. Make sure you get a photo with your team and get that email to yourself. We're also going to be doing a couple of yoga sessions tomorrow and all of that is also on the schedule. You can check that out tomorrow afternoon. And that's all the activities in the venue. Related things in terms of communication. Want to keep things very streamlined.
00:17:14.240 - 00:17:47.952, Speaker A: Everything we're going to talk about, about this event on logistics will be on Discord, and you can go there to see everything that everybody's talking about. This includes talking to our partners, our mentors, and any official announcements from the ETHGlobal team. And that's all on Ethglobal.com. Slash discord. This also means that everything that may change will also be communicated to all of you on Discord. But whatever you see on the website is the source of truth. If something is running late or something changes or we swap a room, we're going to make sure the website is updated first.
00:17:47.952 - 00:18:10.404, Speaker A: And whatever the website says is what's happening. A lot of the workshops are over, so that example is not the best situation to talk about right now. But in case something changes for judging, you want to check the website at all times, and that's where everything is going to be. And in case you want to know what the website is, it's just Ethglobal.com slash Lisbon. And of course, remember, you're in person. This is not an online event anymore.
00:18:10.404 - 00:18:40.432, Speaker A: Just talk to each other. If you want to try to find somebody, you want to find a partner, and you want to know how some protocol works, you can just walk up to that table and ask them. Or if you're curious about what the team next to you is working on, ask around. If you're really stuck on this react bug that you can't figure out, just shout. Who knows? React and maybe you'll get some help. This actually does work, but let's talk about how the hackathon itself is set up. A lot of you are here for the first time, and I want to give you a quick brief intro on how everything is laid out.
00:18:40.432 - 00:19:01.124, Speaker A: Hacking has officially begun as a 06:00 P.m., which means you can all start working on your projects. You can work on a project on your own or with a team. If you are working with a team, you can have up to five members on your team, and you have the next 36 hours to hack. 36.5 hours to hack. And this is the time you can use to get more ideas.
00:19:01.124 - 00:19:44.788, Speaker A: Talk to a lot of partners to see what you can not repeat from scratch, and just use and leverage some existing protocols or talk to other peers and see if you want to meet somebody who has a skill that you're particularly excited about. And after all of that, on Sunday at 09:00 A.m., that's when submissions are going to be due. The way everything is set up is that everything you're going to be doing this weekend should be done from scratch, which means you cannot build on an existing personal project. What you are doing should be started today as a program and a git repo or a code or a design, and you have only today till Sunday to work on it. We're going to obviously verify everything that you submit. Everything you do must be open source and publicly inspectable by us.
00:19:44.788 - 00:20:18.044, Speaker A: And on top of that, only RSVP hackers are eligible to win. Which means that if somebody was supposed to be on your team and something changed for them and they couldn't come in person and they want to hack online, that would not be allowed. They will automatically be removed from your dashboard later tonight. Everybody must be in person, and if they are not checked in, they will also be automatically removed. If you have any questions or if any edge cases you were worried about, just come find anybody on the Youth Global team. We'll be happy to kind of look at any questions that you have. And of course, we have a lot of things for beginners and experts and anybody with all skill sets.
00:20:18.044 - 00:21:00.664, Speaker A: The workshops accounted for first timers to people who've been in the sequences for years. All that information is also on your dashboards in the Info Center. And everything that we did today was live streamed and recorded, which means that if you missed a workshop, you can just go to ETHGlobal TV right now and just replay any of those talks and watch them on demand and pause wherever you need to pause. And on top of that, you can just find those speakers there in this room and ask them questions. You're in person. And if a few of you who are still looking to meet teammates right after I stop talking in an hour, it's going to be an hour talking. We are going to be hosting a workshop on team matching and team formation.
00:21:00.664 - 00:21:40.220, Speaker A: There's a lot of people who are still looking for teams. There are a lot of people who want to join other teams who bring in specific skill sets, like a solidity developer or front end developer. And if you are still in that position, you can head over to Workshop room one at 930 and you can meet others who are also looking to join a different team. And these are also people with ideas who want certain members who can help them make those ideas happen. And on your dashboard, there's also a Find a Team feature, which means that if you select it, I'm looking for teammates or I want to be contacted by somebody. You can search people who have specific skills who are also looking to join a team. All that shows up on the team tab on your ETH Global Lisbon dashboard.
00:21:40.220 - 00:22:07.456, Speaker A: And remember, 36 hours. 36.5 hours Sunday is when submissions are due. And what that means is we're going to split up a few ways to do judging, and I'll talk about judging in just a second, but there's a lot of help here that we want to provide all of you. So if you're stuck, we have a lot of mentors who are here to help. How do you know who is a mentor? Find people with this jacket. They're very easy to spot.
00:22:07.456 - 00:22:24.600, Speaker A: I can see already ten of them in front of me. And if you see anybody like this, they are not here doing construction. They're actually here to help you with your code. So these are all of our mentors. They're going to be here 24/7. They're taking different ships. There'll be somebody here at all times ready to answer any questions so you can find them in person.
00:22:24.600 - 00:23:03.284, Speaker A: You can also ask them in the mentorship channel on Discord and you just add channel there and any mentor will be here to pick up that question and come find you or help you debug all those things directly on Discord. Now, let's talk about judging. There are two tracks for judging. Once you submit a project, you'll have the option to specify if you want to go through the main judging or just the partner judging. Now, this gets a little bit confusing, so bear with me for a second. Partner judging is if you want any of the prizes from the partners. If you also want to be one of the top ten teams, that's what the main judging is for.
00:23:03.284 - 00:23:36.460, Speaker A: It's not a choice of either or. It just means that if you're going to do the main judging, you get to do both. But if you don't want to do main judging, you still have to do partner judging. I'll clarify that more. But what this means is after you submit your project in both situations, you will have four minutes to demo your project to the judges. We recommend that you also record a video of your demo in case something goes wrong live. But live demos are preferred because we really want to see and make sure that what you did actually works and it's not hard coded.
00:23:36.460 - 00:24:05.204, Speaker A: Also, submission will take you a bit of time. It'll take you at least 45 minutes, if not 1 hour, to fill out the form to submit your project because you have to write a lot of information about what you did. How are you using different APIs, how are you using different protocols? And show us the actual line in the code base, which means that you have to prep for it. Submission is going to be available on your dashboards tomorrow. So you get you to look at what the form is asking for and prepare accordingly. But make sure you give yourself a little bit more time. Really don't do this last minute.
00:24:05.204 - 00:24:43.456, Speaker A: All that is going to happen on your dashboard. Everything is going to be visible in multiple steps. You get to check out all of that quite easily. And in that process you get to specify, these are all the prizes I want to apply for. That means you pick all the companies that you want to go for and the ones you select will be the prizes. And your project will be made notified to the other company and they will know that they're going to expect you to judge your project for that prize. And after you submit your project, you will then have to go to main judging if you checked in the main judging and also the partner judging.
00:24:43.456 - 00:25:33.092, Speaker A: But if you don't want to go to the main judging, you only have to go to the partner's boots. So if you want three prizes from three different companies, you will go to each of those boots and do your four minute demo three times. So that's three four minute demos, and you have to make sure you have enough time for all of that. So don't pick 20 things because you will have to demo 20 times. If you also do main judging, that means you have three plus one, because you have to go to the main judging on the second floor and then individual three sponsors. I don't think I'm helping clarify anything, so I'll just repeat that again later. But make sure that you account for a lot of time for judging if you are applying for multiple prizes and this can be out of order, which means that if you know that you want to present to these three companies, you can go to any one of them at any time.
00:25:33.092 - 00:25:57.192, Speaker A: Or if you also are going to do the main judging, you can go there first or come down here first and do anything out of order. None of that's going to be different. But just keep in mind that everybody has to see your demo to win and see any prizes. That was a lot. Let's wrap up. Code of conduct. This still is an in person event and as part of that, you must follow and adhere to our Community Guidelines and our Code of Conduct.
00:25:57.192 - 00:26:58.140, Speaker A: All the rules in terms of IP, what is allowed, media policy, how to do any of these things, all that is defined on Ethglobal.com rules, but the gist of it is that please be respectful for each other and harassment or abuse in any form will not be tolerated. We will kick you out if we hear something or if you're seen doing something that is not appropriate. And if you need any help, please contact anybody on the Global team or report anything that you feel like makes like a violation of our Code of Conduct policy and we'll take action immediately. So that's everything on the logistics that will help you get ready for everything we're going to do the next 36 hours. Let's go into some other pieces that we want to talk about and that is bringing on some amazing partners who are here to help you succeed this weekend. And they're going to come on one by one and they're going to talk about who they are, what they do and why they're excited to be part of this event and what you can do and what you can win if you build on some of their SDKs.
00:26:58.140 - 00:27:04.020, Speaker A: So, first up, I'd like to invite Maddie from Optimism. So without further ado, please give Maddie a big round of applause.
00:27:10.280 - 00:27:13.444, Speaker B: Hello. Let's get this here.
00:27:13.482 - 00:27:13.988, Speaker A: All right.
00:27:14.074 - 00:27:37.768, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Maddie. I'm the head of developer relations for Op Labs. We're part of the optimism collective building optimism. And there's a couple of things you need to know about optimism. So optimism is a few things. It is an EVM equivalent layer. Two main thing you need to know about that is just if you can ship it on ETH mainnet, it is trivially easy for you to ship it on optimism.
00:27:37.768 - 00:28:14.692, Speaker B: And in fact, you should, because it is scalable, faster, cheaper, and it'll let you do different things, let you build different applications to increase that throughput. So it is also a modular tech stack. So we make the Op stack, which is our open source modular tech that powers everything behind optimism. And the important thing there is, because it is modular, if you have ever wanted to rip out a different piece of a roll up and do your own thing with it, now is your chance. And we have a bounty for that. So these are the three bounties that we have. And so the three of them are hack the op stack.
00:28:14.692 - 00:28:55.844, Speaker B: And that is where take the Op stack and bend it to your will. If you're doing anything with identity, if you're the kind of person that gets really excited about attestations or verified credentials or anything that identity can emerge out of on chain actions, we would like to see your project and we would like to see that on optimism. So come talk to me, come talk to the team. We're sitting right over that way and that gets us to the pool prize. So we have 4K for if you don't fit into either of these two categories and you deploy on optimism, then you qualify for this. And I'm looking for Kelvin. Kelvin, are you out there? Can you raise your hand? Kelvin is over that way.
00:28:55.844 - 00:29:14.156, Speaker B: So if you look over there so the optimism booth is over there. Look for the trees, look for the greenery. So go talk to Kelvin and we have some testnet ETH for you. So we'll give you some girly ETH to help you ship your project. We want to hear what you're building. Ultimately, we just want to help people build really cool stuff. And, yeah, we're here to help make it happen.
00:29:14.156 - 00:29:19.330, Speaker B: So that's it for me. Happy to pass it on to the next person. And thank you all for being here.
00:29:22.260 - 00:29:34.704, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you. Next up, Miguel from WorldCoin. Please give Miguel a big round of applause. Yeah.
00:29:34.742 - 00:30:05.980, Speaker C: I'm everyone. I'miguel Or Bondia, I guess, and I would usually start this presentation by talking about civil attacks and how it's important, but realistically. Over the last few months, we've seen the world change really, really fast. We got stable diffusion. We go up, we could see that not working, but we saw stable diffusion. Chat, GPT, all of these amazing AI tools. And being able to tell who is human on the Internet is becoming way more important than it ever was before, even outside of crypto.
00:30:05.980 - 00:31:13.110, Speaker C: So this raises a lot of really important questions, both about how do we fairly distribute the value that all this AI technology generates, and also how do we know what's real online, how do we know who is human? And to solve this issue, we've been working on something called Wallad, which is a protocol that lets you fully, anonymously verify that someone is a real human, and moreover, that they are performing an action only once. So, for example, receiving an AirDrop for the first time or claiming NFT or voting a governance proposal while still managing to keep the anonymity. This is super flexible. It can be used in a lot of really cool crypto ways like governance, like I mentioned, or even web. Two ways, like joining a discord or signing in to an application. And all of this is powered by the Orb, which makes sure that you're a real human and issues you a wallet ID in a completelyonymous way. If you want to get on board by the Orb, but you want to learn more about how it works, our booth is over there, and I'm sure my colleagues will be excited to explain how it works.
00:31:13.110 - 00:32:01.270, Speaker C: And we've made this really cool product that uses serial cryptography and all of the Orb magnets to be able to make it really easy to verify that someone is a human online. And we've made it this easy to integrate. This is all of the code that it takes on your front end to be able to get a zero h proof that then the user is a unique human that you can then verify on chain VR smart contract or off chain VR API. And yeah, like I said, Wallad, it's really, really easy to integrate. Works on and off chain and kind of solve resistant, which is something that we've been wanting to for a while. And so we have lots of use cases on our documentation. We also have an extended version of ideas that you may want to build with.
00:32:01.270 - 00:32:28.830, Speaker C: And we have 20K in prices for all of you, both for best overall creative use cases, governance applications, signing with Wallcoin, a lot of stuff to play with. And there's this link, wallcoin.org Lisbon 23, where you will be able to find all of these resources that I just mentioned. Starter kits, documentation, all that you may be able to think. So look that up if you have any questions. Our booth is over there. And let's get the building.
00:32:33.520 - 00:32:39.180, Speaker A: Thank you. Next, I want to bring on Tony from Polygon. Please give Tony a big round of applause.
00:32:40.080 - 00:32:59.140, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. Hey, everyone. GMGM. My name is Tony. I'm from Polygon, and I just came to tell you about some of the exciting prizes that we have. Polygon is a scaling solution for ethereum and we have a number of different offerings. And we also have a very cool identity solution called Polygon ID.
00:32:59.140 - 00:33:43.144, Speaker D: I will not take up a lot of your time, but I'm just keen to make sure that you guys understand some of the bounties that we have available. First of all, we have five K available for the best cross chain hacks. So using the brand new polygon ZK EVM, I'm not sure if some of you have actually heard of it or not, but it's the very first Mainet ZKE EVM that's on Mainet, Mainet Beta. And I'm hoping the scroll guys don't throw things on the stage at me at this point. Okay, cool. I survived saying that. And we want you to be able to actually build on top of the protocol and be able to send messages to and from the Zkevm.
00:33:43.144 - 00:34:22.908, Speaker D: We also have up for grabs the best use of Polygonid's verifiable credentials. And polygonid is our decentralized identity solution. And if you want to build on top of Polygonid, we have the core engineering team that's available here. So if you come to our booth over there and you have any questions and thoughts about how to build on Polygon ID, just feel free to reach out. We are here to support you. And if you do end up being successful, there's a total of five k available there. Second to last prize is the best public good with account abstraction or gasless transactions.
00:34:22.908 - 00:35:07.080, Speaker D: And so we want you to build public goods because public goods are good. And so we want you to actually use account abstraction and gasless transactions to be able to power the next wave of public goods, because gas fees are not exactly accessible for the Global South, and we recognize that, and we want to accelerate the development of more equitable public goods. And finally, we have the pool prize, which is anybody and everybody who deploys on Polygon. We just need you to tweet about it. And if you go to the website, we'll show you the criteria. So I really hope that everybody is excited about building on Polygon. You could build on Polygon ZKE VM if you're looking for a chain.
00:35:07.080 - 00:35:21.430, Speaker D: You could build on Polygon POS if you're looking to actually deploy to our side chain. Or you could build using Polygon ID and extra points if you use Polygon ID for me, because I'm really passionate about that particular project. But thank you very much.
00:35:25.320 - 00:35:32.020, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you, Tony. All right, next up is Sergey from 1inchh. Please welcome Sergey.
00:35:36.540 - 00:35:45.116, Speaker E: So, hi, everyone. It's pleasure for me to stay here because and, of course, hi, everyone.
00:35:45.218 - 00:35:45.580, Speaker A: Like.
00:35:45.650 - 00:36:12.310, Speaker E: Hello, lisbon. And it's pleasure for me to stay here because we were born on Hackathon exactly four years ago, 19th May 2019. We were participating on ETH New York on Ethereum Global Hackathon. And that's me. Not this guy on the air mattress. That's me here with the blanket. Second sleepless night.
00:36:12.310 - 00:36:48.568, Speaker E: My body stopped to warm up anymore, so I had to find a solution. And all the Red Bull drinks are not mine, actually from these guys here who were also on the table. So from just in four years, we grew to a huge project. We have built a lot of products. The first product, what we have built on a hackathon over two sleepless nights. I personally didn't sleep 56 hours over this weekend. We have built aggregation protocol.
00:36:48.568 - 00:37:35.420, Speaker E: We invented the aggregation for digitalized exchanges. We came to the idea with my co founder Anton that it makes sense to aggregate and exchange multiple liquidity sources in one single atomic transaction to improve the user experience and the execution, the rate for the user. Since then, we have built a lot things like liquidity protocol, limit order protocol, order book protocol, our fusion self custody wallet. We are working on own hardware wallet, which will be the first open source hardware wallet in the world. So everyone can participate and contribute and benefit. Of course, we are working on kind of institutional products as well to open the market for web3, also for institutionals, 70 percentages of market share of aggregation protocol. 80 percentages of limit orders protocol.
00:37:35.420 - 00:38:18.472, Speaker E: Four and a half million of unique wallets. One out 80 core contributors around the globe who are participating in software engineers, experts, marketing people, business people, working on one each network and overall we raise one at $90 million. This is kind of a good example maybe for everyone here. You can build your own unicorn by just continue to build. If you fail, just stand up and try it again and you will get it, I'm pretty sure. And if you need any help, you can come to us. We have grants, we have Bounties here for this special hackathon.
00:38:18.472 - 00:38:49.972, Speaker E: We have $20,000 of Bounties back into 2019. I won just $350 bonus from ENS with one inch and we were able to pay my airplane ticket back to Stutgart to Germany. So here you have the chance to just get 20K in total. So build things. You can just come with a new innovation. We don't care if it's about one inch or not. If you solve a problem, come to us and you get good amount of money.
00:38:49.972 - 00:39:08.604, Speaker E: And you have also a chance to get a grant from our Dow, for example. So we have our fusion where you can build on top of it and on top of our delegation and staking system. You can also get a grant. So just come to our booth. We will help you. So that's it. Thank you very much.
00:39:08.604 - 00:39:12.990, Speaker E: It was once again pleasure also for the organizers. Really pleasure to stay here.
00:39:13.440 - 00:39:30.352, Speaker A: Thank you. Sergey. It's amazing hackers like you that kind of achieve something amazing and bring and share back to the community. So excited to have one and support us too. Well, next I want to bring on Ale to talk about gnosis chain. Please give Ale a big round of applause. Thank you.
00:39:30.486 - 00:39:59.020, Speaker F: I'm the last one, guys, so I'll be very brief. There is only one slide. As you may know, Gnosis is a community run chain, proof of stake and fully secured by collection or a set of validators with 127 plus K validators securing the network it's EVM. So all the tool sets it's supported if we go I lied. There are two slides.
00:39:59.440 - 00:40:00.476, Speaker A: This is the one.
00:40:00.578 - 00:40:49.580, Speaker F: So if you scan this QR code, you will get access to the documentation site where you will find all the protocol specifications, how to run or how to use an RPC node, get some funding. So please don't start pushing too much. The Faucet, we can help you there. We have a booth and also set up and configure all the DevTools. There are twenty K dollars in prices for innovative DApps using AI hashi. There is an underlying technology for bridging and account abstraction using the Safe SDK. We have a booth over there, so come and get help and please, please enjoy your time hacking and enjoy the weekend.
00:40:53.680 - 00:41:32.564, Speaker A: Thank you. Well, those are some of our amazing partners. There's a lot more prizes that we're giving out and we'll talk about them in just a few minutes. But before we get to the prizes and kind of let all of you get back to hacking, we want to do a quick conversation about how this ecosystem has evolved and specifically a lot of themes that we've seen the last few years. Want to reflect on that and understand kind of how things are moving ahead. And what I want to specifically talk about is how DeFi has changed and what we have learned in the last few years and what we're excited about in the future. And for this, I want to bring on Stani, co founder of Ave and Lens, to share a few of his insights over the last few years.
00:41:32.564 - 00:41:48.530, Speaker A: So, without further ado, please join me in welcome coming, Stani, on stage. All right.
00:41:49.220 - 00:41:54.640, Speaker G: Bob Dion, GM BD.
00:41:56.500 - 00:42:28.350, Speaker A: Well, Stani, I am super excited to welcome you here because you've almost been to every single ETH global hackathon ever. And that's one amazing because you've been part of this whole ecosystem from its initial foundings. Not just ETH global, just ethereum itself. And what I want to spend the next 1015 minutes on is talking about how things have changed. Let's start all the way at the beginning. How did you get the idea of Ave and how was Ave started or ETH Len, as I used to know it?
00:42:28.800 - 00:42:44.720, Speaker G: Yeah, been quite a long journey and it's actually very fascinating to be here now after a few years and seeing the community grow. These hackathons used to be very small. It was just basically me and Kartik.
00:42:46.580 - 00:42:53.972, Speaker A: I remember a few years ago we did the world's biggest ethereum event as a hackathon, and it was only 400 people. Yeah.
00:42:54.026 - 00:44:09.096, Speaker G: So it's grown quite substantially. So it's super exciting to see how Ethereum or even beyond Web Three community has been growing, specifically the developer community and very early. What was fascinating for me is that if you think about Blockchain and what we're trying to solve, I personally tried to solve kind of like a smaller challenge of being able to use a crypto asset as a collateral to unlock liquidity as a use case. But what I noticed, what got my interest is that Blockchain and Web Three is something where you can solve challenges globally. So you solve something for someone, but it can be applied to everyone. It's basically a way to create democratic software borderless that doesn't take into account the background. So you can create like a very neutral software that can handle people across globally.
00:44:09.096 - 00:44:36.580, Speaker G: And that was something very appealing to me. And I think crypto in general had this kind of like perception as well and got me in the first place to build something interesting. And finance, I've been always a finance geek and seeing programmable smart contracts was something that got me excited to actually build the very predecessor Ethland before Aave.
00:44:37.400 - 00:44:39.510, Speaker A: What was DeFi like five years ago?
00:44:40.280 - 00:45:03.896, Speaker G: Well, back then there wasn't DeFi, so there was one decentralized exchange and the kind of like idea of what if you could actually trade against smart contracts and they have specific rules and you can create orders without giving custody of your funds.
00:45:04.088 - 00:45:07.016, Speaker A: Talking about Ether Delta in case somebody remembers.
00:45:07.128 - 00:45:17.810, Speaker G: Yeah, there was probably Ether Delta and something else, kyber radar Relay. Radar Relay. We met someone from Radar Relay today, which was very strange because.
00:45:19.620 - 00:45:20.096, Speaker A: There is.
00:45:20.118 - 00:46:05.970, Speaker G: A lot of projects and people in the space, even these projects, they change and evolve, but you see people staying in the space, which is quite amazing at the same time, but it was very small. So over the years now, I've seen decentralized finance grow substantially, even peaked. I think at some point over 200 billion worth of value. Looked across different smart contract infrastructures, I think Ave peaked at 28 billion or something. So substantially grown quite a lot. It's still small compared to finance in general, but for us, a bunch of kids building future of finance that was quite amazing.
00:46:07.780 - 00:46:18.260, Speaker A: From what you initially wanted Ave to be and what it is now. Do you feel like you accomplished a mission? How has it changed, how does it differ from your original vision?
00:46:19.080 - 00:47:13.560, Speaker G: Well, the original vision was just democratizing finance, providing everyone access and mainly the same equal opportunities. So that has been always the vision of what we want to do, increasing financial and also social participation. And looking back now, I think we've been able to achieve some sort of kind of like success in our community. I think kind of like the game isn't over yet because I just feel that DeFi has so much potential for me when I talk about DeFi. I usually think about DeFi as just finance. It's just better, faster, stronger finance. And I think that's the mindset you have to think about it if you want to build beyond our community.
00:47:13.560 - 00:47:42.240, Speaker G: So I think the path has been right for the Ave protocol, especially because it's now decentralized, it's governed by the community. So anyone from here can become a delegator platform and become a kind of like a protocol politician or you can as a developer contribute directly to the protocol and improve it. And I think that's big part of decentralization. So I think we're in the right path.
00:47:42.900 - 00:48:00.870, Speaker A: That's kind of interesting because I feel like we've seen DeFi go from nothing to something. I mean, forget different primitives, we didn't have stablecoins until a few years ago. We remember this space before stablecoins existed and you kind of saw everything through the peak of DeFi summer and then a lot of things.
00:48:02.860 - 00:48:04.660, Speaker G: I missed those yields.
00:48:04.820 - 00:48:12.010, Speaker A: Well, let's not forget COVID in that same window. But do you feel like interest in DeFi has gone down.
00:48:14.140 - 00:49:05.264, Speaker G: In terms of the sentiment? I would say not necessarily, no. I think I meet more people that are interested in decentralized finance. Something that has changed, especially over the past maybe a couple of years and especially the past year, is that DFI is no longer the entry point to web Three. That basically means that we onboard more developers and more users into the space. That doesn't necessarily come from the D Five perspective. That might be the creator economy, that might be through Dow participation, that might be through web Three social. But that's actually a good thing because you might onboard from one particular area but you might then gain interest in DeFi.
00:49:05.264 - 00:49:56.860, Speaker G: And I've seen this happen also in the space and I would say that building DFI has changed a lot. So there is not any more kind of like a gap filling. So especially like few years now we've been filling different kinds of gaps in web3. We're looking what kind of transactioning we have in traditional finance and try to kind of create similar, maybe a bit more improved ecosystem or improved protocol. Maybe it's like swapping or lending and have it in DeFi. And I think now it's just kind of like a different time to build, where you have to build in a way where you have to figure out what is the thing that actually suck in traditional finance.
00:49:57.440 - 00:49:58.604, Speaker A: It's a big list.
00:49:58.722 - 00:50:48.110, Speaker G: Yeah, it's a big list, but it's also a challenging list because whatever isn't working and you have to figure out that how you can actually use blockchain technology, smart contracts, everything that we have and actually improve those challenges. And I think the traditional finance has a lot of things that can be solved with the blockchain, with the transparency, the accountability and also the immutability and everything can be programmable. So I just think that it requires a bit more effort, which is a good thing because whatever you're going to build, if it's going to move the needle, it's going to move a lot and that will bring new users into the space. So times are just a bit different now.
00:50:57.240 - 00:51:46.276, Speaker A: Some fans here well, that's what I love about hackathons. You get to keep things just real and sometimes a little bit interruptive. But that's an interesting point because I think a few years ago, kind of the narrative but also just what we saw was DeFi is the killer app for Ethereum and we saw programmability to finance but now there's so many other entry points DAOs exist. We have NFTs as a massive thriving ecosystem. You talked about social gaming. All of these things are bringing different kind of audiences in and of course that creates a lot of distractions for even developers because they have too many choices. But one thing I'm kind of curious about is all kind of the common complaints we heard about DeFi back years ago.
00:51:46.276 - 00:52:01.340, Speaker A: We thought it would be fixed when l two show up fast transactions, no gas or cheap gas or you cancel everything without a penalty, all these things. But we still see a massive spike in DeFi. Why do you think that is or what's missing?
00:52:01.680 - 00:52:48.856, Speaker G: I think also that layer two is exciting innovation, both optimistic and ZKE EVMs. It's about scaling Ethereum and especially with today's Ethereum prices and the more users we're going to onboard we're going to have more challenges with scalability. The idea of being able to transact outside of Ethereum and periodically settle and use Ethereum as a finality layer is going to bring a lot of space to build. And I think it's quite early still because even optimistic roll ups, they've been around for I guess like a year, maybe a year and a half in.
00:52:48.878 - 00:52:51.192, Speaker A: Total at least on main net and even longer.
00:52:51.246 - 00:53:42.780, Speaker G: Yeah, I know. One year in DeFi is like five years, but it's still very early and I think it's the first time we actually are starting. Because when people say that there might not be things to build in DeFi, I actually see more and more people coming to me and talk about DeFi. And it creates this kind of like, excitement around what could be the next things to build. And I usually talk about payment more about those. Yeah, I talk about payments quite a lot because Bitcoin in its infinity was supposed to solve peer to peer transactioning. Ethereum came and you essentially had a virtual computer on a blockchain and you can make programmable finance, which is amazing.
00:53:42.780 - 00:55:17.112, Speaker G: We build exciting things and scalable protocols and now with layer two we can actually go and tangibly solve the payments infrastructure because you could actually transact in scale and maybe it even requires like a layer three or some sort of additional solution. Exactly. But that's like a very important problem to solve because we're all crypto users and everyone has a wallet here, everyone has an NFT and even I'm pretty sure everyone has Pepe coins as well. But no one actually is able to pay ongoing basis with crypto and that's a big problem because we're the builders and we're the developers and the very first thing that we tried to solve with blockchain we really haven't been able to do so. But now we actually have a tangible choice. So whoever actually goes and starts to think about those use cases and also beyond that, not just building applications but figuring how we bring businesses on chain and actually use decentralized finance is going to be valuable. And I think that goes back to my experience when I was 1516 building websites and at that age when you have some server cost you want to offset them some way you either add Google ads or then you add payment methods like credit card payments for something.
00:55:17.112 - 00:56:14.060, Speaker G: And stripe was very popular then and it allowed it create this kind of like a certainty that you can actually trust the internet payments. And effectively what happened is that any business, any part of the world could well not any part of the but most of the parts of the world could actually have a global distribution end user client network and that was huge. That basically brought all the businesses and a financial layer into the internet and PayPal did before that even incredible job as well. And I really love the $20 liquidity mining that they had as well. So it just showcases how early we are and if we are able to solve the payment parts, the payment infrastructure, that is something where it brings not just end users but businesses into web3 on chain economy.
00:56:15.440 - 00:56:48.630, Speaker A: I think that payment obviously is an excellent point. 13 plus years later after Bitcoin with the title of peer to peer exchange, we haven't been able to make that commonplace. But what I took away from what you just said is seems like we have now all the primitives we need but we haven't seen those primitives being used in ways that find meaning to end consumers. Is that a fair assessment or do you feel like we still need a few more primitives that exist in traditional finance or maybe more in DeFi that are preventing us from building more useful things?
00:56:49.020 - 00:57:52.364, Speaker G: I think we have everything we need. We just basically need to kind of move from kind of like building back end DeFi to build front end DeFi. Meaning that we're using these amazing protocols that we have and starting to think actually what the experience and the flow looks like on the end user side and how we bring closer webtree for everyday users or maybe settlements between businesses. So I think that definitely exists. And another thing that is very exciting and valuable is that we built interesting credit system on chain but it's based always on digital collateralization and in most cases over collateralization. So something that we could actually move also forward with is trying to figure out how to build a credit network or network of credits. Yeah, I think that was the idea.
00:57:52.364 - 00:58:18.864, Speaker G: So what it means is that you could actually use blockchain in terms of registering different kinds of payment, data repayments, credit scoring and evolve a bit from the layer of overclock and start building trust networks. And some of them will fail, but it's totally fine because most of the things in life and businesses and startups fail anyways.
00:58:18.912 - 00:58:20.096, Speaker A: A lot of trial and error.
00:58:20.208 - 00:58:20.870, Speaker G: Exactly.
00:58:21.640 - 00:58:37.604, Speaker A: So we want to see more useful payments, we want to see a better way of thinking about credit systems. I guess I'm curious on with all the excitement we're seeing on account abstraction, zero knowledge proofs, do you feel like there's an obvious thing that we can do to integrate those types of things in DeFi applications?
00:58:37.732 - 00:59:57.692, Speaker G: Yeah, and I think that's where if you're able to prove different kinds of different sort of information about yourself, when you can actually use your identity, your knowledge, your experience, and produce data and prove that as well. On chain without exposing the exact data as well, you can actually start building interesting use cases around validation of, let's say trustworthiness credit scoring as well. So those things are very valuable for the economy because most of the people they do start with a very low kind of like equity which means that if you want to empower and use blockchain for empowerment and especially with DeFi, you have to go beyond the collateralization because that infrastructure works pretty well. It's fine but you will have to find components. How do you empower? By getting and providing more access to credit. And to be honest, you could actually build a pretty damn good credit scoring and credit network on chain. Because even if you move today from one country to another, your credit scoring doesn't passport.
00:59:57.692 - 01:00:08.550, Speaker G: So it just showcase how clunky the existing system is and it isn't borderless and global and I think there's a lot of ways to fix that.
01:00:09.160 - 01:00:20.880, Speaker A: With DFI you can add elements of privacy too there because that helps a lot more integrations with web two or just traditional finance and DFI and I feel like that's also a bit underexplored.
01:00:21.060 - 01:00:57.300, Speaker G: Yeah, especially because I think even the privacy itself could bring more people. I think it's very valuable that DeFi started as more like a public infrastructure. So not just the markets are public, but also the addresses and balances. And that kind of like created a lot of credibility auditability as well. And that creates a bit better equitable finance. But down the line you will have to add more privacy to DeFi, and solving that aspect is super valuable.
01:00:57.720 - 01:01:10.730, Speaker A: I absolutely agree. I want to come back to the primitives again. You are building a stablecoin which has some unique features and I guess I'm curious about what Go is, why did you decide to build it and how does it work?
01:01:11.420 - 01:02:08.140, Speaker G: Yeah, Go is an overcolosed asset where effectively it's based on a model where we've used already on it land on the overcolorization. We use the same model at Ave and where any reductions of the collateralization value will get rebalanced by liquidation. So it's a proven model. And what's interesting about Go is obviously you can mint it against your assets that you are supplying into the Aave protocol, meaning you can also earn on your collaterals while you're minting and borrowing Go. But I think regardless of the technicalities, there's so much information there. And Jess from our team made a very exciting workshop today on the technical specifications. But I think one of the biggest things that differentiates Go from anything else is the vision.
01:02:08.140 - 01:03:22.612, Speaker G: And I think Go probably will be very accessible asset in the DeFi ecosystem. But the idea is to actually get Go into more payment layers and figure out those different kinds of applications and use cases where Go could actually empower and become a payment layer for intranet. And I think down the line as Go gets adoption and there's more scalability. Also I believe in this concept of having choice as a user. So I frequently talk about being a liquid citizen on chain. So where you have a lot of choices, you can move your funds from one protocol to another and there is really minimal risk of doing that because everything is based on very proven infrastructure. So as an end user, you kind of have the choice of selecting not just consumer applications but also like infrastructures, payment trails, stablecoins communities essentially that represent your values and are backing the things that you appreciate in life.
01:03:22.612 - 01:04:20.020, Speaker G: And I call it kind of like going beyond the face value. So if all these stablecoins are pegged into the same tracker value, going beyond that means that actually you could track, because of the traceability and the transparency, which of these stablecoins are contributing more to reduce, for example, global warming or funding young entrepreneurs because it's on chain and basically selecting that kind of a payment currency on your day to day activities. And by your choice you can kind of like as a bigger group of community move the needle more. So I think that the vision part of getting into payment rails and helping Go is effectively a tool. It's you the builders that can actually build something tangible where more people have access to Go and have value in these use cases.
01:04:21.820 - 01:04:33.708, Speaker A: That's a really good way to think about that. I think people are already choosing different front ends or protocols based on what they like and communities. But extending that to money is something that you just didn't think you could do before.
01:04:33.794 - 01:04:47.648, Speaker G: I actually had an idea once that we should do at over like 15 different front ends and let the users just choose because that gives more optionality end of the day, I think social.
01:04:47.734 - 01:05:16.570, Speaker A: Kind of peers through everything eventually. Yeah, that's basic. Well, let's try to talk about something that's more practical for founders here or people thinking about going into DeFi. You kind of said that people are not coming to you more and more, which is interesting because from the surface it looks like we're not seeing too many DeFi launches or the things we're seeing is more version upgrades from things that are already out there. So I'm kind of curious on if somebody's thinking about building in DeFi, what should they not do?
01:05:17.740 - 01:06:19.884, Speaker G: I think they shouldn't rush for many reasons. One for sure is that if you're building DFI, it might be very mission critical software. So a good example is that if there's a rocket that doesn't make to the moon or let's say to the orbit, that might be 150,000,000 issue. If a substantially high D Five protocol gets exploited, that could cost billions. So some sort of kind of like generality of risk is important risk management. And also I will not go too fast because you have to take time to build things. But especially if you're going to think of becoming a founder, there's a lot of new things that you're going to learn and spending time and learning is probably the most valuable thing to do.
01:06:19.884 - 01:06:35.152, Speaker G: And I think in my early days, things were moving super fast and I kind of like regret that I didn't try to slow down and take more time in learning a lot of the things I'm doing now.
01:06:35.286 - 01:06:42.768, Speaker A: Do you have kind of frameworks for how you think about what idea to pick and how you should think about starting something now in 2023 in DFI.
01:06:42.944 - 01:07:34.310, Speaker G: A lot of people comment in terms of showing kind of like, proposing improvements into your existing infrastructure, so creating a slightly better AMM or slightly better lending protocol or slightly better stablecoin. But I really recommend to do something that is very contrarian and maybe even isn't really a marginal improvement on the existing DeFi ecosystem, but actually something that is very even risky. But if it works, it really proves something. It actually can actually prove some new use cases as well. And also Kudik's advice is that you should ship I would not say ship slowly, but shipping in a way that.
01:07:37.240 - 01:07:40.632, Speaker A: Helps you kind of frequently. The high python. Oh, I see.
01:07:40.686 - 01:07:47.960, Speaker G: Like frequently. But small updates will be the good idea. Small updates.
01:07:48.860 - 01:07:54.824, Speaker A: Small updates that's incremental. Incremental, incremental, incremental progress, but not incremental ideas.
01:07:54.872 - 01:08:18.988, Speaker G: I usually say that the best case is to ship every week, something out, even something small. Like you want to leave Friday night, your computer, by getting something out and probably by Wednesday. By Saturday it's already broken, but who cares? You're doing it also for fun. And if your app isn't breaking I'll.
01:08:19.004 - 01:08:41.620, Speaker A: Keep this very quick. I'll keep this very quick. I'll wrap this up in the next two to five minutes. I don't know how fast I'm going to talk. We have over $275,000 in prizes and I want to just summarize some of the big ones. 1inchh is our first one, so 1inchh is giving $20,000. So the best use of Fusion API will get 4000 for first place, 3000 for second place and 2000 for the third place winner.
