00:00:10.490 - 00:00:11.438, Speaker A: My name is Kart Taken, one of.
00:00:11.444 - 00:00:15.450, Speaker B: The co founders of Eve Global and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to Pragma.
00:00:15.530 - 00:00:20.734, Speaker C: These conferences are fantastic opportunities to just connect with a lot of diverse people in the entire space.
00:00:20.852 - 00:00:34.098, Speaker D: The evolution of the zero knowledge proof space and the future of scaling using their knowledge proofs and the really interesting properties that ZK rollups ZK proofs in general can give you four blockchains.
00:00:34.194 - 00:00:48.102, Speaker A: We want to have a louder voice and no, no, look, this is really important, this is working. People having access to microcredit or they're getting paid, they're able to work in the digital economy. To me that is sort of what's going to define the future of Ethereum.
00:00:48.166 - 00:00:56.554, Speaker E: I think we're finally at the point where we're hitting the scale that we need to really support really big useful applications. So I think that's very exciting.
00:00:56.602 - 00:01:04.900, Speaker D: For me, the space have been incredibly inviting and welcoming and it's been a really interesting journey. I met a lot of very smart, engaged people.
00:01:10.310 - 00:01:27.174, Speaker F: Ethereum is going to serve as the foundation of the world's onchain economy which is just starting to be built. But over the next few years we'll go from less than 10 million people who are transacting that economy to billions of people who are transacting the economy and Ethereum is going to be sitting at the bottom of all of it.
00:01:27.212 - 00:01:35.194, Speaker G: To me, the future of Ethereum is first and foremost scaling with validity proof in particular, I think Starks are going to be the way.
00:01:35.392 - 00:01:44.206, Speaker A: I think the power of the technology stack is that it is global and so even sort of what may seem like a small idea can turn into a massive public good or business.
00:01:44.308 - 00:01:54.880, Speaker B: What we're trying to do with Suave to ensure that the future of Ethereum and crypto more broadly is decentralized, is allow the centralized infrastructure to be turned into smart contracts on a decentralized platform.
00:01:55.250 - 00:02:04.962, Speaker H: We are always pushing to get improved Ethereum with a single goal that's to bring this technology to the humanity, to solve real problems of the people and to make a better world.
00:02:05.016 - 00:02:15.922, Speaker G: So now Polygon 20 and this highly scalable interconnected web free infrastructure built on top of Ethereum, we can really explore very interesting new use cases and tackle important upcoming challenges.
00:02:15.986 - 00:02:21.842, Speaker I: The mission has been very clear mission has been for me also. It's very, very clear that we want to take web three mainstream.
00:02:21.906 - 00:02:27.190, Speaker C: It's really important that we're collectively as a community really thinking about this and really building from the ground up.
00:02:27.260 - 00:02:38.030, Speaker F: The moment is now for creating the application nations that will bring the next billion users on chain because the infrastructure is ready, the technology is ready, the platform's ready, Ethereum's ready.
00:02:38.100 - 00:02:42.266, Speaker D: We keep working, keep pushing the boundaries of the space forward together and it's.
00:02:42.298 - 00:02:43.980, Speaker F: Going to take all of us to make it happen.
