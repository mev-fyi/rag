00:00:07.050 - 00:00:27.350, Speaker A: All right, cool. Let's start. Welcome everyone. Happy Monday or Tuesday, depending on where you are in the world. Hope you guys are all having a great day so far. We have Eric from Livepeer here to do an amazing workshop on video NFTs Beyond Collectibles. And with that being said, I'll pass the mic off to Eric for his presentation.
00:00:28.090 - 00:00:50.478, Speaker B: Thank you, Anna. Hello, everybody. I am Eric. I'm the co founder and CTO at Livebeer. Really excited to be doing this workshop with you all today. I want to talk about video NFTs Beyond Collectibles, just to kind of set the ground the context a little bit. Right.
00:00:50.478 - 00:02:19.000, Speaker B: I think today we all very much know NFTs as this form of collectibles. So you can buy NFTs, you can trade them different NFTs, have different values and collectible values. And I think that's a really great way for the mainstream to be exposed to the NFT movement and also to blockchains in general, right? And that has had huge value for our whole ecosystem and this whole blockchain industry in that it just introduced so many more people to blockchain concepts. But being a technologist, I'm also really excited to start thinking about what's available beyond Collectibles, especially for something like video, where this media format is so rich, has potential to be interactive, has the potential to do really engaging and deep storytelling and be used as tools for all kinds of interesting purposes. So I want to start sharing some of these ideas and start sharing how you can potentially use Live Peer to bring some of these ideas into reality. Okay, so to dive into my presentation a little bit. So to introduce Live Peer live Peer is the video streaming layer for Web Three.
00:02:19.000 - 00:03:24.906, Speaker B: And the reason we built Live Peer is because we have kind of the video storage layer for Web Three, like Filecoin. We have the smart contract layer for Web Three, like Ethereum. But in order for the Web Three ecosystem to really become mainstream, there needs to be a video streaming layer. And that's because video is about 80% of all the traffic on the Internet today. Right? And missing that important layer is really going to kind of stall the adoption for the blockchain and Web Three ecosystem as a whole. If you have built any kind of video streaming applications in depth, you realize that having infrastructure for streaming video is really crucial in order for video streaming experiences to work well. So, for example, YouTube, which is owned by Google, is by far the largest infrastructure consumer inside the Google ecosystem.
00:03:24.906 - 00:04:28.510, Speaker B: And that's precisely because there is this large need for infrastructure to serve video applications well. And this is what lifepeer is building, right? Live here is building the video streaming layer for Web Three. So what does that really mean? We're looking at the Live streaming use case here. It means that a broadcaster can send a video into the Livepeer network and the network will do all the infrastructural work so that these videos can be streamed to the end users devices, whether it's a computer in the browser or it's a mobile phone or it's a smart TV, wherever they are. And this network essentially replaces the centralized infrastructure that's needed today in order to build a video application. So a little bit about Livepeer. You can go to the Explorer to check it out.
00:04:28.510 - 00:05:09.242, Speaker B: Live here is formed of many nodes. We call these nodes orchestrators. They bring capacity onto the network. At the top here, you see the number of minutes per week that's being streamed on the Lifeyer network. Here we see about 2.2 million minutes of video being streamed into the Lifeyer network per week. Right now let's jump and talk a little bit about the video NFT use case today as collectible, right? So what does that mean? It means video NFTs are created using the ERC 2721 standards.
00:05:09.242 - 00:06:41.402, Speaker B: And how it works is that there is a token URL that you can specify in your smart contract that points to an external location that specifies the metadata for this video NFT. Right? So for example, if we go here, which is a nifty gateway NFT, you will see that this is the video and the NFT itself, you can see that it is an MP4 file that is being streamed over here and the MP4 file kind of lives here, right? That is part of the specification in the ERC 721 standard. So that's basically how it works. Right? You create an ERC 21 token, you specify this token URL to point to an MP4 file that can live on IPFS, for example. And then any application that wants to show that NFT will just go there and load the video. And then people can trade that video around and it's public by default. So what about video use cases that are beyond collectibles? So let's first take a look at video in Web Three and how that's transforming.
00:06:41.402 - 00:07:55.278, Speaker B: Right, what we see here is there's a big trend that's happening, which is the creator economy is migrating to Web Three. So the creator economy is this ecosystem that any creator can create video and post them on these existing video platforms and make revenue from that. So if you are a YouTube creator, you post videos on YouTube, twitch, Streamers, Instagram, all of these different large social applications are being built this way. What we see today is that a lot of these creators are kind of getting fed up by these big platforms taking the lion's share of the profit and that they're starting to move to Web Three ecosystems in order to get better opportunities. Right? So we're seeing these new platforms popping up like the native NFT, trading platforms like OpenSea, Zora. But we also see interesting consumer applications like Glass XYZ or Audience. And all of these applications are built on top of Web Three infrastructure filecoin Rweave, the Graph Lifepeer are all some examples of that.
00:07:55.278 - 00:08:58.858, Speaker B: And in this web3 world creators own the content, they own the audience, they're simple and transparent payment methods and they're built on web3 infrastructure. In the long term they're going to be a lot more scalable than web Two applications simply because they're not built on centralized infrastructures and anybody from the world can participate in this economic gain. This is kind of the overall ecosystem. Let's go in and think about how does NFT fit in this way? What do NFTs actually represent? Well here are some examples. One NFT can represent tickets. So instead of a collectible item you can mint an NFT that represents a ticket for an event. So here we have actually the ticket for the NFT NYC event which just happened a couple weeks ago.
00:08:58.858 - 00:10:16.234, Speaker B: So you can buy an NFT and use that to gain access to a physical event or to a virtual event. Another thing NFTs can represent memberships. What we see here is one of the most popular NFT communities out there the Board Ape Yacht Club. So if you own a board ape, not only do you gain access into the different events that the board ape community is hosting, the important thing is that if you own a board ape, you belong to this community. You're a member of the board ape community and all kinds of experiences can be built around the board ape community in order to serve the board ape community members. And finally, NFTs can represent royalties, right? So here is a railroad interface when we're minting an NFT and here I can specify royalty of 30% when I mint the NFT. Which means anytime the NFT is traded the ownership transacts 30% of that transaction value is going to go towards the original creator of the NFT.
00:10:16.234 - 00:11:53.902, Speaker B: Right? And that's a really powerful concept because today in the entertainment industry, in the creators world it's close to impossible to track all of the royalties that happen in all the transactions here the smart contract just encodes that and it becomes reinforced forever. Now with some of these concepts, let's think about what can we build with video NFTs. One simple example you can build token gated live streaming applications. So what does that mean? It means you can either use ERC 20 tokens or ERC 721 NFTs or ERC 721 tokens or 1151 whatever standard you want to use to represent access to a specific live stream. And this is basically saying that if you own a token or if you own above a certain amount of a token then you can watch the live stream. Otherwise you cannot watch the live stream. Why is this interesting and why is this powerful? Well imagine you can start to create live streams that are specific for an audience that the audience need access to, right? For example as the organizer of a dow you can create a live stream that's only specifically to the Dao and only Dow members can access that Live stream.
00:11:53.902 - 00:13:11.770, Speaker B: Or as a member of Board Apes, you can watch a special concert that's put on by an artist that only if you own the Board Ape can you watch that. This becomes a really interesting enabler to create value on top of NFT ownership. Another interesting thing we're seeing is the metaverse is emerging, right? Not only the meta at Facebook, but also decentralized metaverses. We're seeing decentraland, we're seeing Sandbox, we're seeing Crypto Voxels, we're seeing lots of new metaverses emerging in this decentralized world. And video streaming becomes a really interesting tool for us to tie the virtual world with the physical world. We're starting to see concerts happening inside these virtual environments where people are streaming those concerts from the virtual environments out into the physical environments onto the big screens and vice versa. People are streaming DJ sets from the real world into the big screens in the metaverse.
00:13:11.770 - 00:14:33.860, Speaker B: So just tying together the two worlds start to create really interesting experiences. And of course, video streaming in and out of the Metaverse, you need infrastructure to do that. And Livepeer is here as a tool for you to do. And finally, here's something that we haven't talked about as much, another hack idea which is really around machine learning capabilities. So something that we don't talk a lot about at Lifegear, but it's a really interesting capability, is that Lifeview actually not only enables video streaming and transcoding, it also enables machine learning tasks that gets done on top of the video. So for example, when you're streaming video through the Lifeyear network, the network can actually also do things like content detection to help you figure out what kind of video is being streamed. Imagine if you're building a live streaming platform that's decentralized, you want to make sure that certain questionable content are not streamed on your platform if you want to, right? And so having these types of mechanisms can really help the application developers to figure that stuff out.
00:14:33.860 - 00:15:35.702, Speaker B: Content recognition is just one type of machine learning capability that you can do on Live here. And since Live Here is an open source platform, there's actually lots of different possibilities in terms of the type of machine learning tasks that can be done. And we're looking to work with developers to add things like object detection at things like face swapping, at things like creating synthetic objects inside the video, making video super interactive. So all of that is a super interesting area that I'd love to see hackers working on. I want to briefly introduce the prizes for Life peer this time. At Web Three gem, there's a total price pool of $8,000 split across three different places. The first place is 4002nd, place is 2000, and the third place is 1000.
00:15:35.702 - 00:16:55.426, Speaker B: And there's a price pool that everybody can share. For anyone who has implemented a Life Pure integration, that's a complete end to end integration in a working demo. There are lots of tools and resources for hackers. So we have an example, Token Gated live streaming application that I'm going to walk you through in a little bit. There is an in browser broadcasting SDK that one of our engineers built so that you can have a user open up a browser, use their webcam to do a broadcasting session without needing to download, like, a piece of special software for broadcasting the content. There is a web based example built in Next JS that just illustrates how to interact with the hosted Life Pure gateway, how to build kind of a video streaming experience from that. And there's a mobile demo application built using React native that can be compiled into iOS and Android that kind of shows off the same similar capability where you can broadcast from a phone and you can also watch a broadcast from a phone.
00:16:55.426 - 00:17:27.446, Speaker B: So I definitely recommend you to check them out. They're all in the Lifepeare GitHub. And of course, there is the Getting Started Guide@lifeyear.com, which is the hosted Lifepear gateway into the Life network. You should definitely go check it out. Any web3 gem hackers can get some free credits on the gateway. So you just sign up for a free account, let us know, and you can start using that gateway for free and build your hacks.
00:17:27.446 - 00:18:04.998, Speaker B: And finally, we'll have lots of support for you. We'll be hanging out in the ETH Online Discord Life Here channel, and our engineers will be there. I will be there. We'll be there to help you answer any technical questions about Lifepeer, but also to talk to you about your hack. If you have any feedback, anything like that, we're happy to have those chats. All right, so we have about ten minutes left. How are we doing on questions? Is there any questions?
00:18:05.164 - 00:18:33.630, Speaker C: We do have a question in the chat, Eric. Okay, so the question is, if I have a video hosted in IPFS, is there a way to pass that CID through live Peer to output for the through live peer to output for the transcoding capabilities? Our video is not live streamed, thus not an RTMP input. Correct. You might have already mentioned it, but another pass would be much appreciated.
00:18:34.770 - 00:19:22.478, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So it's really about kind of if you have a video file already and you want to transcode that video file, can you do that with Live Peer? Absolutely you can. And we're making that easier and we're building tools to do that. Currently, what you can do is you can actually just stream that video into Live Peer and turn on the recording feature and the transcoding will be recorded and you will get kind of a transcoded version out and then you can stream that. Cool. Okay, so let me give a quick demo for the Token Gated live streaming example. Here was the last thing.
00:19:22.478 - 00:19:58.650, Speaker B: Here's what this looks like, right? It's a very simple application. And what this is saying is we're looking at a NFT that actually I purchased a couple of days ago. And we're saying that if you have the NFT, then you can access a live stream that I'm doing. And if you don't have an NFT, then you cannot access it. So we can even take a look at what this NFT looks like on OpenSea. It happens to be NFT of this really interesting new live streaming kind of TV show that's coming out. I think that's called Mad world.
00:19:58.650 - 00:20:45.642, Speaker B: I'm really excited about this. Mad Realities. Yeah, really excited about this. Anyways, so going back here and I have this wallet that I used to purchase that NFT, I'm going to switch to a different wallet where the wallet does not hold this asset, right? So when I click on Login, MetaMask is going to ask me to sign a transaction. And I try to sign it and it says, hey, you don't have the NFT. I said, okay, now I'm going to switch to the wallet that I actually have the NFT and I'm going to log in. MetaMask is going to ask me to sign another message.
00:20:45.642 - 00:21:21.480, Speaker B: And now I see this is the live stream that I've been doing and we have access to this live stream. And it's a pretty simple example, but it illustrates this token gating type of concept, right? So let's take a quick look at how this is built. It's actually really quite simple. So here we have a very simple JavaScript application with a back end and a front end. So let's go into the back end. We'll see that there are a couple of endpoints. This info endpoint is not that important.
00:21:21.480 - 00:22:43.834, Speaker B: This check endpoint is the thing that basically checks the incoming signature that I signed with MetaMask. So the front end is going to send that signature into the back end with the post request. And here we're just doing checking the signature to make sure that the signature is in here. We're also checking whether the address actually owns the NFT, right? So here we're checking, does the address own this NFT in this specific contract? And if it does, then we return true, if it doesn't, we return false. And in the front end we can simply decide to show or hide the player depending on the ownership of the NFT. And the other thing that's interesting is that this is actually a proxy for the video itself. Because one of the things that some people have point out in the past is that hey, after getting the access to the stream, you can just open up the developer console and copy the URL of the video and then share it with somebody else and they'd be able to watch it.
00:22:43.834 - 00:23:26.080, Speaker B: But here we're actually running the video through a proxy, but only running the playlist through the proxy. The playlist is a very small file, so it doesn't take that much bandwidth to be able to proxy it and deliver it around. And here for every request we can actually validate. Okay. Is this video request coming from a browser? That's coming from the browser session for a specific public key. Right. And here we can basically prevent that type of stealing of the content and say only if the signature is valid will we return the video.
00:23:26.080 - 00:24:00.770, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's my demo and that's my workshop. I'm going to go back to my presentation. Want to check again? Does anybody have any questions for the last five minutes? All right. If not, I look forward to seeing everybody at the hackathon. Good luck, and I'll be in Discord talking to y'all about your hacks.
00:24:02.230 - 00:24:33.600, Speaker A: All right, thank you so much, Eric, for your wonderful workshop. I'm sure everyone learned a lot and it was super interesting. As Eric said, he can be reached on Discord in the Live Peer Sponsor channel and otherwise, this workshop will also be posted onto the YouTube, the East Global YouTube, so feel free to reference that. And with that being said, once again, thank you so much, Eric, for taking your time to present this workshop. And thank you to the rest of you for joining us today. Have a good.
00:24:35.330 - 00:24:38.420, Speaker D: Is it too late to ask Eric a question?
00:24:38.870 - 00:24:40.660, Speaker B: Please ask away.
00:24:41.830 - 00:25:10.300, Speaker D: Oh, my God, dude. That's dope. Hey, I love your presentation, dude. So I feel like you had this NFT presentation. How are you making NFTs cheap? How can I interact with your protocol without burning tons of money? Are you guys on polygon or these other chains right now?
00:25:11.070 - 00:25:58.220, Speaker B: Great question. The streaming experience on Live Peer is actually blockchain agnostic, right? And what that means is you can build this NFT gating experience using any layer, one using any blockchain, and still be able to kind of utilize the hosted gateway. So you actually don't need to do any minting from lifetime's perspective. All you have to do is to figure out how to mint your NFTs however you mint it, right, polygon or near or wherever it is, and then you can kind of build that authentication process with the specific chain that you're using. Does that make sense?
00:25:58.910 - 00:27:27.720, Speaker D: Yeah, no, that totally does. Quick heads up. I just want to let the Ethan Line person heads up. Just cut me off whenever. But yeah, I'm wondering, so I launched a protocol called Share State, and what we do is let people deposit their E or E validator shit, right? So for you as well, you allow people to deposit tokens to have a protocol that lets people handle media, in essence. Right? So I'm just wondering, is there a way you can scale up from that? Right? Because right now, as somebody that has a protocol that has media, you handle all the profits. How do you scale up from that? How do you let other people handle the media, handle the infrastructure for hosting that media?
00:27:30.570 - 00:27:43.270, Speaker B: Great question. I'm guessing the question is about kind of how value flows in the Life peer network.
00:27:43.430 - 00:28:05.380, Speaker D: How do you scale up from there? Right? Because you have a great protocol, but how do you expand out from there? Because at the end of the day, you can make a lot of money doing what you're doing, but I think you can make more money, like letting other people be infrastructure providers, if that makes sense.
00:28:06.550 - 00:28:43.242, Speaker B: Yeah. Lifepeer is a decentralized protocol and is a decentralized network. Right. And in fact, if you go to the Live Here Explorer, you will see that there's already 100 participants nodes that are running Live Here nodes. And if you go there, you can actually see the amount of monies that they're making. So if we just go to Explorer Lifepeer.org right now, you will see that last week the transcoders made over $10,000 on the network.
00:28:43.242 - 00:29:26.750, Speaker B: Right. And this is one of the highest networks in terms of kind of Web Three infrastructure revenue that's being paid. So it's already decentralized and it's already sharing the profit out to the participants who are providing infrastructure. And the other thing that I would say is that through a staking protocol, that staking is a way to share profits and share ownership of the network to all the participants. Right. So inflation happens every day in the Lifeyear network. And all of that inflation is shared proportionally to participants in the Lifeyear network based on their stake.
00:29:26.750 - 00:29:51.800, Speaker B: And these are kind of node operators, and the node operators are sharing those rewards to the people who stake towards them. So this is how we make sure that the rewards of the Lifeyer network is shared amongst all the participants, all that who participate in the Lifeview network from day one.
00:29:57.110 - 00:30:07.540, Speaker D: So you're open to other protocols, like DeFi protocols, kind of like jumping in and participating in Life, right?
00:30:08.970 - 00:30:48.690, Speaker B: Yeah. That's really interesting. In fact, there's a really cool project called Tenderize that's like liquid staking for Lifepeer, right? So what they do is they have a protocol that allows you to stake your lifepeer token through Tenderize. And Tenderize would issue a Tlpt token to you while helping you stake on the Life Here network. And with that Tlpt, you can kind of participate in D Five protocols. It's very similar to kind of what Lido does for kind of ETH Two Staking.
00:30:49.430 - 00:30:58.626, Speaker D: Would you mind just dropping that in the chat? I would love to help out build a contract for that.
00:30:58.808 - 00:31:05.000, Speaker B: Yeah. Here is Tenderize, and there's a really cool team working on that project.
00:31:09.690 - 00:31:33.310, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. So it looks like that's all the time that we have for the workshop today. Great questions. And thank you, Eric, for being so awesome with the questions and the workshop and everything. So yeah. All right, have a great day, everyone, and enjoy the rest of Web Three jam.
00:31:33.310 - 00:31:35.050, Speaker A: Bye.
