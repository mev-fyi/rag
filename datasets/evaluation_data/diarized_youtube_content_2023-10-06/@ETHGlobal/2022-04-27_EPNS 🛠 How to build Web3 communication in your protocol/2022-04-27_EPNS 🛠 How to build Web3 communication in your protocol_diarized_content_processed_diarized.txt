00:00:18.280 - 00:00:53.432, Speaker A: Hi, guys. Welcome. My name is Fabio. I am a developer in Today. The goal of this talk, one of our workshop, right? The day is to see us talk about how you can integrate protocol, how you can send off chain application, how you can monitor on chain events, how you can integrate from end to retrieve notification and to display notification to your users, right, from your tab, right? Okay. So communication happens all over the place, right? We know that communication happens on discord, on Twitter, on discourse. They're everywhere.
00:00:53.432 - 00:01:39.044, Speaker A: And it's funny because in web three, what happens is protocols expect users to go directly to their desk or to protocol information, right? And funny enough, that's not how we do in web two, right? For example, let's say I have a meeting, ten minutes. It's not like Google Calendar pressing F five or monitoring only event. Google Calendar sending an event like a reminder ten minutes before. Like, hey, you have a meeting, ten minutes, prepare. Or the same thing for WhatsApp? Whenever I receive a call on WhatsApp, there is a push notification. So will the service send a push notification to the user with two actions that I can answer the call or I can just a call. So in web three, so let's say an example, let's say I'm on Aze and I'm about to get into data on Avid.
00:01:39.044 - 00:02:38.168, Speaker A: How do I know I'm about to get into data, Ronald? Well, I have to keep monitoring my position constantly. Or how about when my ENS domain is about to expire? Well, let's constantly keep looking for it. So, like constant access for the user to keep monitoring their web three information, right? So what is the solution? So what you can ask building. You can ask building the communication layer for web three, right? So the communication is open, which means that any back end, any front end, any smart contract can send notifications to Wallet addresses. The communication is dynamic, which means you can say anything you want. You can send the YouTube video wallet addresses, you can say the proposal, you can send notification whenever someone updates you on OpenSea, you can say the song. So basically, we don't impose any restrictions for this type of notification.
00:02:38.168 - 00:03:09.648, Speaker A: Central wallet addresses. The communication layer we are building at Apnx is multi chain. But even though the E for Apnx stands for Ethereum, we are going to be multi chain. As of now, we are in Ethereum. We're going to be on Polygon soon, later on binance smart chain harmony across all year. Twos are same STARnet and also all three of ones, they're not EVM compatible. So EVM and non EVM chains, the notifications are gasless.
00:03:09.648 - 00:03:48.610, Speaker A: I can't do gasless. So you simply sign the transaction using IB seven one two to send notifications. And the last part is the notifications are platform agnostic, which means that any crypto front end can fetch information from our protocol. It's not like you need to use our mobile app or our Chrome extension or adapt to fetch the notifications. Any crypto front end can get those notifications and display to their users on their DAP. And we're going to do a demo. This explain this, how this platform agnostic works, how it can display notifications to users in any DAP, actually.
00:03:48.610 - 00:05:01.832, Speaker A: So what are the applications for KNS? Right? One pretty useful is for DAOs. I think a lot of people here are part of multiple DAOs and we can get lost on discord and discourse on Twitter whenever there's a new proposed poll, right? So what can happen for a Dow, let's say uniswap Dow or other Dow, they can send a push notification to Wallet addresses, say, hey, there's a new proposal expired in seven days, please read the proposal and vote accordingly. And that's something we're working on is right from the push verification, you can read the proposal. You're going to have three actions whether you can vote on the proposal for, against or abstain on the proposal right from the verification. So the goal is to increase user engagement on Dows, to increase quality of votes so people, they get to all the proposals beforehand, the quality of those, we hope to improve it firstify. A lot of the cases, right, whether about catrica, they don't have it. I mean, it's good to know before you farmers out there when you want to design whether the API protocol gets interested.
00:05:01.832 - 00:06:18.452, Speaker A: When you start putting your funds on DeFi protocols for NFTs, let's say someone place a bid on your NFT, someone wants to buy your NFT, well, get a notification like, hey, someone interested in NFT. When you're part of someone, you're part of an NFT auction and someone outbids you. Well, if you really want this NFT, it would be nice for you to get notifications so you can outbeat the person possible for metaverse, let's say you're playing a game and there are two users and two users in web three means ID wallet addresses so you can chat back and forth using Eknas communication here. That will be so sending back and forth messages between wallet addresses. So we're very fortunate to have a lot of people, we call them friends with KNS. They have given to us constant feedback so we can improve the protocol and build this chain agnostic open provisionless communication layer. Since we're in hackathon, just like you guys know, we have Bounties, we have four K dollars Bounties for anyone who is building on top of PNS.
00:06:18.452 - 00:06:34.684, Speaker A: We have back end SDKs. Front SDKs. If you integrate eternity in your project, just apply for a bounty. Or if you're interested in applying using Ethernet in instance in your project, but have no idea, please chat with us. We're here literally 24 hours. If you can't talk at 02:00 A.m., 03:00 A.m.,
00:06:34.684 - 00:06:47.456, Speaker A: 11:00 A.m. Doesn't matter. There's always going to be someone here to help, like people. The team here was like 05:00 A.m. And people were talking to hackers at 05:00 A.m.. So please talk to us. And in question about it, about the protocol, please reach out to us.
00:06:47.456 - 00:08:01.664, Speaker A: And also, just a side note, we released our Push Grants program. So we have $1 million for anyone who builds on top of can ask, want to do tutorials or blogs, please open the proposal. It's open and the committee is going to approve. Or the grant program is transparent. That means that they so I have a video just for people to see how the differences actually are. So just want to talk about something about video. But the idea of this video is show how notification are.
00:08:01.664 - 00:08:47.548, Speaker A: But by any means you need to use our mobile app to get this notification, right? So any crypto front end can set those notifications. We just showed our mobile app because it's an example, having this actually mobile app for doing what received post notifications. You can use our mobile app, but notifications are not tied to any EPNS front end. Just making this sure. So how does protocol work in the second level? So the protocol is made of three main components, right? So the first component is what we call EPNS four. So is a smart contract that is on Ethereum. Whenever you want to send notifications to wallet addresses, you must do something called you must create a new channel, which means activate yourself in the protocol.
00:08:47.548 - 00:09:25.736, Speaker A: And the analogy I always use is if you're on YouTube, right? So if you're on YouTube, you create a YouTube channel and users want to send your protocol on your YouTube channel, they subscribe to your YouTube channel to receive notifications. That's the same analogy. So if you want users to receive notifications for your Dow, for your DeFi app or NDC marketplace platform, you create a channel and users opt into the standoff and the opt in for the standalone. I mean, users don't pay fees at all. So gasless no money wasted. Not wasted, but no money evolved for user received application. This is on ethereum.
00:09:25.736 - 00:10:08.648, Speaker A: So this market contract is responsible for activating channels that is on Ethereum. The last part, the second part is our UPNS Communicator layer. And the UPNS communicator layer is made of two parts. So the first part is the Communicator SDK So, which allows sending off chain notifications. Gaslessly. And the second part for Ethernet Communicator are our set of smart contracts that are going to be everywhere, every chain EVM, non EVM chain that is going to allow any smart contract fall or Communicator smart contract to send notifications. And third but not least, you have a peer to peer network of those there are validators.
00:10:08.648 - 00:10:46.466, Speaker A: They're going to monitor communications emitted from the Apnx Communicator layers, whether they're off chain or on chain notifications. And they're going to index those notifications. So any crypto content can simply fetch those notifications and display those notifications in any way they want to. Let's read the channel. Let us stay here. So I'm on the staking app. So I created a wallet here.
00:10:46.466 - 00:11:06.810, Speaker A: I refunded it. So basically, builder the channel. I mean, let's see, staking. We can go to production channels that we have. So let's say I'm a user. I'm looking at this as a perspective. So let's say I want to get swap notifications for uniswap feature opting send transaction.
00:11:06.810 - 00:11:29.300, Speaker A: I'm going to receive notifications for you. Swap alpha homework. Let's say that's how Yam I mean, defines Coindat snapshot uniswap decentralized partnership. Can I ask a question? Sorry? Can I ask a question?
00:11:31.670 - 00:11:40.386, Speaker B: Where does the signature go? Is it a centralized registry somewhere? Or it goes to the nodes. When I say when I subscribe, when I've been in one of these channels.
00:11:40.498 - 00:11:53.340, Speaker A: Yes, it goes for future network of nodes. So they're commissioners. We're working on decentralizing those nodes on this network. Yeah. Thank you, network. Yeah. We have some good news.
00:11:53.340 - 00:12:13.010, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's create a channel. So developer, go here and create a channel. Let's just minimize this. Let's come here. I need an image for my channel. So I got to see this image.
00:12:13.010 - 00:12:32.234, Speaker A: I need to state 50 die to activate myself as a channel. Continue. Let's create a channel this. Now we don't need to fill it because this we don't need fill when you go with all you chain. But I don't know.
00:12:32.352 - 00:12:33.050, Speaker C: But soon.
00:12:33.120 - 00:13:37.970, Speaker A: Yes, let's create this is a channel for East Amsterdam communication contraction link is on our channel list here. We see that a lot of channels. So call to action for our channel is if your users want to get more information about our channel, you can put your website here or your protocol or east. Answer them. Let's confirm transfer my feet to Die approved. I just signed it to approve myself in the channel on this webchain open communication layer. Oh, yes, good.
00:13:37.970 - 00:14:10.610, Speaker A: Okay, so I have a channel created. That's it. But let's do something now. So I activated myself in protocol. So whoever subscribes to this channel are going to receive those notifications. So let's send notifications to whoever is subscribed to this channel. I have a preloaded channel here that I have our mother's wallet that directs subscribe to this channel.
00:14:10.610 - 00:14:45.514, Speaker A: This one here can. So let's send notification. So as a creator of a channel, that's the web page. Okay, let's send notification to whoever is subscribed to this channel. So we have three types of notifications. So the first one is a broadcast notification notification, which means that anyone who is subscribing to this channel, they're going to receive the notification. The second one is a target notification.
00:14:45.514 - 00:15:16.650, Speaker A: That is, you can specify a particular like, say, send a notification to this wallet address. The third one is a subset of notifications. We've got an array of wallet addresses, and the notifications are designed to those addresses. So in this example, we're going to do this broadcast notification header notification. It says hello. Hey there. And as I said, the notifications can be anything.
00:15:16.650 - 00:15:54.460, Speaker A: So I can come here. That's our song here, put the link notification, assign the transaction, that's it. Notification was sent. So if I come here to my inbox, since I'm subscribed to my own channel, I received the notifications. That notification I received, that's not here, but the data, if you click here, going to go to the Call to Action link. And the Call to Action link can be, for example, a proposal. So user receive a notification.
00:15:54.460 - 00:16:45.446, Speaker A: If you click on the notification, you are redirected to the snapshot or Uniswap governance right from there. Or if you want to click on the notification to go directly to the Avi or compound or whatever to put in more collateral. Let's go to our second demo, which is the front end SDK. So this one part is very important, which is the set before, I'm just reinforced any crypto front end and Facebook notifications. So the demo that I have here, so I have four to uniswap front end, and we have a front end SDK. So the front end SDK, we have a react component that is listed, right? So it says that I have six notifications here. They click here, that's notification, same here.
00:16:45.446 - 00:17:30.294, Speaker A: When it's blue here, it means there are Call to Action. So all the notifications that this wallet has ever seen is going to be right on June swap or whatever app you want to. And we also have one feature that I didn't have time, but in here is the users don't need to go to our EPNS DAP to subscribe to channels. We have another react component that's like, hey, you want to reply Maggie for uniswap? Or I don't know, I'm using Uniswap or whatever in this app, right from your dad, hey, want to get notified? For any events on this protocol, the user click opt in, send a transaction. That's it. The user never, ever leaves her zap to receive notifications or to opt in to receive notification. I think that's powerful, actually.
00:17:30.294 - 00:18:06.046, Speaker A: So it makes it translate everything very seamlessly. Last but not least, just a back end SDK. As I said before, the notifications, they can be sent by any logic. We don't impose any restrictions by how send notifications or how notification is sent. So just be like a very simple node, like chrome job, basically, what it's doing. My private key here. Everything's hard coded here.
00:18:06.046 - 00:19:13.700, Speaker A: But yeah, I'm just doing like a pretty simple bot that is calling coin worker cap to get the bitcoin price and creating summaries like single sication, like, hey, that's the summary of the movement of bitcoin last 24 hours last week or last month. So different SDK. One, I mean, this is probably my pocket key, my channel address to all my funds, my SDK. We just need two parameters, which is the private key the wallet who created the channel and the channel that you're going to receive as soon as you activate yourself in purple after taking and last but not least, can be anything. Message can be anything. I'm descending from just spamming the just spamming the network. But I'm sending send three notifications here.
00:19:13.700 - 00:19:50.974, Speaker A: Go back to the Uswap tab. If I refresh here, I should see three things here for notifications, which are here. So you see like the back end application network, the push nodes, they got the notifications. They can ask communicator layer, got the event. They index the communication in a way that any person, any crap can tap into this peer to peer network network of pushing those to get notification. Of this example, you spot and they see notifications that I sent. See, those are things from the dev.
00:19:50.974 - 00:20:15.134, Speaker A: And these are the notifications I sent using the DAX. Yeah, that's it. What I have for today. One thing I want to note to say, we are very active on Discord. The team is here. So we have office hours on Discord, like every week. If you want to talk to us, reach out to us, give us feedback.
00:20:15.134 - 00:20:50.490, Speaker A: Please feel free to reach out to us. Great things come here. If you want to ask questions, feel free to ask questions. If you want to meet us on stairs, drink a coffee or whatever, feel free to do so. When we're sending a notification where the data is stored on chain, so on the node, on IPFS, so all the data is it encrypted? We can send encrypted notification as well. Okay.
00:20:59.920 - 00:21:02.044, Speaker C: And it's encrypted with the private key.
00:21:02.082 - 00:21:02.830, Speaker A: You said.
00:21:04.720 - 00:21:06.812, Speaker D: The public. Yeah.
00:21:06.866 - 00:21:13.840, Speaker A: Okay. Asymmetry so anyone can decrypt it? No encrypted with the public key.
00:21:13.990 - 00:21:16.640, Speaker D: Anyone who has the private key can decrypt.
00:21:22.900 - 00:21:23.650, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:21:25.960 - 00:21:43.610, Speaker C: And my other question is can we build peer to peer message messaging app on top of EPNS or would you have limitation in term of storage? If I want to rebuild WhatsApp on EPNS, what are the limitation today to do so.
00:21:45.520 - 00:22:10.058, Speaker A: Anything on top of it? So what we do, we're literally an infrastructure project. We are building it. We're monitoring notifications on chain or off chain. We're indexing it. And what you're doing, the notifications is all up to you. Selected graph. We have we're going to have a peer to network of nodes.
00:22:10.058 - 00:22:17.460, Speaker A: That's what we're working on. That's going to index notifications. And if you want to build anything on top of it, you're more than welcome.
00:22:22.010 - 00:22:30.246, Speaker B: I have another question about privacy. And are the least of the subscribers of a given channel public or private?
00:22:30.438 - 00:22:33.180, Speaker A: That's a good question. Do you know her? I mean, of course, you know.
00:22:36.190 - 00:23:11.174, Speaker D: These are like the wallet address. All right, I love this Q and A. These are the wallet addresses that are giving their opt in or intent. So of course, that's something which is public that you do know that this wallet address has opted into this channel. One of the reason is that let's say if you're a smart contract, then you need to send a notification out, so you have to check if the user is subscribed or not. That's how we prevent spam. But yeah, they are public.
00:23:11.372 - 00:23:37.646, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Network with notification service. Sorry, go ahead. How do you integrate with sending notifications on Apple devices tomorrow? Yeah, so we have a component on the push notes. On the push notes. What does exactly? Communication. So we have a component, we have this, but we're trying to refactor the code.
00:23:37.646 - 00:24:28.142, Speaker A: So it's modular, it's not a part. But the thing is, you can use Firebase send notifications. So when you run a push mode, you can do it yourself as well. So you can just tap into the network and like, oh, there's a new network, there's a new communication for particular address that I'm interested in. So I can just push this to Firebase or anything you want to to send notification to the Wallet app? Yeah, I have a mobile app here for I can have some stating. So the other notification that I sent on this demo, they're being pushed they're being pushed to my app. This is part of push notes you're bridging? Essentially, yeah.
00:24:28.142 - 00:24:43.640, Speaker A: You know the bridge from battery to web two. But I mean, we don't need to but from a twitch on my mobile app, that's what you place.
00:24:46.650 - 00:24:52.854, Speaker C: Is it feasible to send push notifications based on events that happen in the smart contract?
00:24:52.982 - 00:25:33.206, Speaker A: Yes, of course. Someone place you can create your own bots. The demo that I did here, I was getting information from marketcat, but you can monitor on chain events and send notifications based on on chain events and then also select which users to notify. Yes. So we have three types of notification. The first one is a broadcast notification, so it's saying to everyone. The second one is Target, which means you have to want to send notification just for this Wallet address.
00:25:33.206 - 00:25:42.502, Speaker A: And the third one is our subset of notifications. So we have all three flavors to everyone to one wallet or subset of wallets.
00:25:42.566 - 00:25:43.420, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:25:46.160 - 00:25:50.188, Speaker A: Please. Thank you.
00:25:50.274 - 00:25:59.008, Speaker B: I want to know about the price for the service. I know maybe arrived just a minute after, so maybe I missed that. I saw that we need to stake like 50 die, and stake means that.
00:25:59.014 - 00:26:00.016, Speaker A: We also get that back.
00:26:00.118 - 00:26:04.160, Speaker B: How does it work? And is there a price push notification?
00:26:04.740 - 00:26:10.564, Speaker A: Yeah, I have for this, but I would love to for Horse to answer this because it has a clear vision for this.
00:26:10.682 - 00:26:58.764, Speaker D: I think you and I will just talk. So the price which you saw, that's like the activation price, a part of it, like in 50 die goes to a fee pool, but the rest of it you can of course return back. So the idea is to punish the user or channel just a little bit but not the entire die and to keep that die in stake so that in case they do something wrong we are able to penalize them as and when the time comes. But yeah, you can basically get back the die. So that was your first question. The second question was what is the charge for the service? So right now, of course it's completely free. Our plan is to keep it free for like a year or two years or till whatever time it takes to get the network effect.
00:26:58.764 - 00:27:30.716, Speaker D: But once that happens there will be a fee that will be charged, that will be a monthly or a yearly fee and again it will happen through the protocol, it will flow through the protocol. So it's like a circular economy which we'll have at that point dive will be replaced by push tokens. But yeah, it's something that will come later on once Naitai network effect is there and of course it will be around $5200 is what we are going to propose to the community. But eventually they decide have you thought.
00:27:30.738 - 00:27:40.304, Speaker A: About putting the stake die into an interest bearing like sustainable? Yes.
00:27:40.342 - 00:28:13.770, Speaker D: So the version zero which was just for ethereum, the plan was that this is state die, it will not even be 50, it can be any number and the state tie goes into our way, it starts generating interest and the people who opt in they are able to get their interest out. But when we went multi chain we had to basically balance that out because we will not be able to do that on polygon or anyone anywhere else. So yeah, that was the initial plan. Awesome idea too.
00:28:15.040 - 00:28:22.900, Speaker A: Thank you. Please go ahead.
00:28:23.430 - 00:28:40.926, Speaker C: Just one last question about the node. What are the requirements to run the node? If next week I want to run a push node, is it possible or what would be the requirement in term of hardware and what's the plan on decentralizing the push node?
00:28:40.978 - 00:29:26.466, Speaker A: So as of now we have one node that is run by us. We have a lot of people working on decentralization of this. Probably I can give you a better answer in a couple of months, but yeah, the nodes are going to be distributed and we're working on the tokenomics for make people incentive, create incentives for people to run this communication layer for web three. The idea is for you're going to be getting incentivized to run this webtree communication layer to help distribute this communication layer that is across chain open chain agnostic. But we are working on tokenomics and entire engineering team working on decentralization of these push nodes.
00:29:26.658 - 00:29:27.302, Speaker C: That's cool.
00:29:27.356 - 00:29:52.960, Speaker A: Thank you. So yeah guys if we're downstairs 24 hours a day please reach out to us, ask any questions you want. Thank you so much. Thank you. It's.
