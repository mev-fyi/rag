00:00:02.410 - 00:00:41.820, Speaker A: But before that, I want to have a quick interview with a person who needs no introduction. So without further ado, let's welcome Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Bitcoin magazine on stage. Hello. It all right. So we were thinking about the stuff we wanted to cover today and it's all over the place when I talk about the future of the past, personal stuff. But let's get right into it at this point. What could stop the merch from happening?
00:00:42.510 - 00:01:23.202, Speaker B: Did you hear the announcement? We delayed it until 2027. No, I think realistically, what could slow down the merge? Definitely unexpected security books. If you wake up in some crazy high month of this year and you discover that the merge hasn't happened yet, some security bugs in the clients is probably going to be the reason things that cannot stop the merge. Any kind of weird minor malfeasance. Like if miners try to do some last minute thing to break the merge, that'll just mean there's going to be some kind of manual fork and it'll happen faster.
00:01:23.266 - 00:01:29.958, Speaker A: What are the possible scenarios of that? And also could you talk about the difficulty bond?
00:01:30.054 - 00:02:22.534, Speaker B: I mean, what could miners do? In principle, miners could 51% attack around the same time as the merge. But with the way the merge is designed, it's basically designed so that the beacon chain fork choice just picks one of the forks and so we're fine. Miners could, if they were really coordinated, kind of stage a protest and just all quit. And if they do that, then we set a particular terminal to whole difficulty and so it could just make it take a really long time until we get there. But if they do something like that and it's really serious, then once again people will just make an update that just either changes the TTD or just sets a particular hash. Right? So there's always a recovery. Mean, what else can they do? They can make fight about centralization on Twitter.
00:02:22.534 - 00:03:07.222, Speaker B: I don't know. I think honestly at this point, practically speaking, I do feel like miners have generally realized that Ethereum is going to proof of stake. And a lot of them are not just miners, they're also stakers. And plenty of them are very happy to be participating in both parts of Ethereum's transition. So I'm actually not too worried. And lots of them, I'm sure they're going to want to start mining on Ethereum Classic or Zcash or any of these other systems. And so they as an industry do have a kind of common interest even going beyond Ethereum there.
00:03:07.222 - 00:03:22.970, Speaker B: So yeah, I guess not too worried about that. I don't know what else I feel like aside from the possibility of software bugs, which is exactly what we're in the process of testing to find out. It's pretty much a full speed ahead.
00:03:23.040 - 00:03:40.642, Speaker A: So I think this obviously kind of touches upon just the complexity that lies in the base layer and you've kind of talked and blogged a lot about just how the layer one should be as simple as possible. What's kind of the philosophy behind that? How does that kind of now reflect on the design for the merge? And let's go deeper into that.
00:03:40.776 - 00:04:34.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think in Ethereum we've been kind of moving toward this hybrid philosophy where layer one tries to be kind of very simple or at least as simple as it realistically can be while layer two kind of takes on the complexity burden of providing very high levels of scaling, providing privacy, providing a lot of the things that users want. Right. The changes that are all kind of going in the direction of layer one does improve somewhat, which is the proof of stake we add to Dank Sharding, which adds a lot of data that the chain gets consensus on the rollups can use and all of these things. But the goal is still to try to add a limited number of tools. That's a very general purpose. And then the layer two and the application layer kind of does the rest.
00:04:34.710 - 00:04:45.526, Speaker A: What's the design process of that? Do you actively refuse to think about adding changes to the base layer? Or is that more of like, you only get to realize this in retrospect? How do you kind of think about that as you're planning this?
00:04:45.708 - 00:05:19.182, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not my decision. Right. Sorry. Not you specifically, just as I know on one of the recent all core devs calls has just decided to kind of not really push hard on kind of non merger related EIPS for a while. In general, I think there's definitely been kind of more and more pushback on adding EIPS. Like even things like pre compiles that would have easily gotten in two or three years ago. They just have a harder time justifying themselves now, which I think is healthy.
00:05:19.182 - 00:07:24.266, Speaker B: I think it's good to kind of not keep on increasing complexity forever and kind of throwing the kitchen sink in and growing step back and think, what do we really need? So there's definitely an attitude of growing conservatism toward changing things. If I had to kind of change that formula a little bit, I would say what I would want to see is not just conservatism in terms of the size of the changes, but also conservatism in terms of the final results. Not just thinking about changing a little, but also, can we make changes toward an ethereum of tomorrow that's simpler than the ethereum of today? So banning self destruct is probably one of those examples, right? I do not want a world where your grandchildren wake up at some dark, rainy morning in 2072, take a look at the killer AI robots outside briefly, and then ask you, but Grandpa, why does Ethereum just have all of this extra two layer weird state tree structure? And why does it have half RLP and half SSZ? And why is creating my own node so hard and you have to answer well, because some people in 2022 kind of just basically gave up and prioritized backwards compatibility. Right? I think there is something to the virtue of kind of accepting some short term costs in order to achieve long term benefits and obviously it's important to prioritize and obviously you can't do everything at the same time. But having this kind of discussion around what are things that do incur short term costs but are going to actually make things better. Ethereum, a better system and a simpler system in the long, long term is like a discussion that I would definitely love to see more of.
00:07:24.368 - 00:07:33.760, Speaker A: So maybe this is a good time to understand how that got applied to sharding and the design and the architecture. Could you tell us about the original design, what it is now, how that happened?
00:07:34.370 - 00:08:54.722, Speaker B: Well, in that case it's a bit of a different situation, right? Because sharding is something new and so the question of minimizing complexity of the change and minimizing complexity of the final outcome, they just end up being perfectly aligned with each other and the design really did evolve a lot in the direction of simplifying the base layer. Right? So at the beginning there was this really complicated quadratic and then eventually cubic sharding design and you had committees on top of committees and you had chains on top of chains and it got really crazy. And then eventually that simplified down to a beacon chain with a bunch of shards that had cross, that were chains, that had cross links. Eventually that simplified further. We got rid of the cross links, we got rid of the shards with an independent fork choice and now we don't even have shard blocks. Right? Like the Dank sharding design is actually very ultra minimal because it basically even has one proposer that just chooses all the contents for the entire block, like the entire 16 or 32 megabytes or whatever and it ends up being right. And that is it definitely is still complex.
00:08:54.722 - 00:09:24.430, Speaker B: Right? But at the same time it's vastly better than what we would have had to deal with had we actually tried to properly implement any of the designs from 2017 while at the same time also having these five other roadmaps of account abstraction and proof of stake and vertical trees and all of those things. Right. So I do think that the Ethereum kind of research community learned and has updated a lot in the direction of proposing things that are actually implementable.
00:09:25.730 - 00:09:51.290, Speaker A: So I think the interesting thing I've noticed is that this is a very recurring theme and it's like a great thing, which is we kind of have initial ideas, they get kind of iterated on, then they just become simpler or even better or just more efficient. Is that something that you think is because we're able to minimize the feedback loops or is that because we just have a lot more research that's kind of being applied faster than in other industries. Why is this repetitive in a good way, as a theme, from your perspective?
00:09:52.030 - 00:09:53.190, Speaker B: Why is what repetitive?
00:09:53.270 - 00:09:53.766, Speaker A: Not repetitive.
00:09:53.798 - 00:09:54.234, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:09:54.352 - 00:09:56.442, Speaker A: Why do we see this happen often.
00:09:56.576 - 00:10:01.002, Speaker B: That the designs get simplified, especially in.
00:10:01.056 - 00:10:02.054, Speaker A: How we think about scalability?
00:10:02.102 - 00:10:46.940, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think a big part of it is, first of all, just the quality of the research team improving. Second, I think the more kind of research thinks hard, the more it actually can build things that don't require developers to work as hard. And ultimately, development is like a bigger slog than research is. Right. So I think it's good when you can make those trade offs and just think a little harder and make something better. The other thing is also just the proposals keep improving because you have the benefit of understanding versions one to version N of the thing. When you build version N plus one of the thing, I think it's a combination of both of those two.
00:10:47.550 - 00:10:51.694, Speaker A: It's just impressive that we see that consistently happen on the research side.
00:10:51.812 - 00:11:00.814, Speaker B: And then three, obviously, is just this ongoing process of actually just learning to value real simplicity more.
00:11:01.012 - 00:11:21.346, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, speaking of simplification, I want to talk about two EIPS, and I think it'll be great to kind of have you talk about what they are first and then let's kind of go into should or should they not be included. Let's start with 48 44. What is it? And should that exist?
00:11:21.538 - 00:12:21.990, Speaker B: Sure. So EAP 48 44, aka proto dank sharding, I guess. Okay, to explain that, maybe we need to start going into Dank sharding in a bit more detail. Right? So Dank sharding is the sharding design that is kind of the result of this long chain of simplifying things and throwing things out after we started from crazy chains back inside of chains back in 2015. And the way Dank charting works is you still have one block per slot, it looks like basically just like a regular non charted chain, except validator nodes don't actually have to validate everything, right. Instead, validator nodes randomly select a few pieces of every block to verify. And because of erasure, coding, data availability, sampling a bunch of math magic, that's actually enough, right? It's actually enough for every validator to only verify a few randomly selected pieces of these big 16 megabytes Blobs or I guess blob lists.
00:12:21.990 - 00:13:30.958, Speaker B: Now, the problem with the eggsharding, though, is that it does require like eraser coding and all of this stuff to actually be implemented. And so what happens before then? Right, so before then we have proto Dank sharding, which is basically a kind of halfway house that can happen before full dank sharding can really be rolled out. And what happens there is it's kind of like you do Dank sharding without actually sharding the data, right? Basically you introduce all of the data formats exactly as they will exist in full Dank Sharding like you introduce this concept of blogs transactions with this extra really big piece of data that's much cheaper but that can't be accessed directly from the EVM. You introduce KZG commitments, you introduce all the math, you introduce all the ways that interaction between the execution and consensus layer will work. You basically do all of the kind of infrastructure work except you don't do this kind of like random sampler check. You still require everyone to just fully download all the Blobs and check them. Right? So in every slot everyone would actually have to download and check maybe about a megabyte of data.
00:13:30.958 - 00:13:42.180, Speaker B: So this amount of data is still a lot. It still provides a huge amount of space for roll ups. It still stands good chance of making roll ups way cheaper than they are today.
00:13:44.390 - 00:13:47.080, Speaker A: Does this have any long term effects on the state size?
00:13:47.850 - 00:14:37.122, Speaker B: Right, so on the state size, no, because these Blobs are not part of the state. But on the history side, EIP. Four four four is another important one. This is the history expiry EIP, basically making it so that clients don't have to store really old history anymore. And this is important both to keep the disk size of an Ethereum node small and also actually to allow Ethereum implementations to become simpler. Right, because you don't need one implementation to be able to process all past versions of the Ethereum protocol that ever existed. You needed to be able to just process maybe the last one or two hard forks and then if you really want to have a node that checks the entire history you can basically just download multiple versions of the client.
00:14:37.122 - 00:15:25.066, Speaker B: And then we'll have to serially verify. Yeah, serially verify. We'll have to implement some interchange format so you can run one of them, then export the post date, import that as a prestate to the second one, run a few more blocks, export the post date and put it into the third and all that. But that's all doable. And basically the idea is to try to allow the nodes responsible for a consensus allow the nodes responsible for the really critical thing of keeping the blockchain running today to kind of be as simple as possible. And there are going to be ways of doing all the other stuff. There are already plenty of ideas on how to create automated networks to kind of automatically start backing up all of the history and make that really robust.
00:15:25.066 - 00:16:12.978, Speaker B: So it's basically guaranteed with a one of interest model that the history will be saved and also actually be able to check and see what happened in the history. But that would be a kind of somewhat more specialized functionality and users who care about that will be able to do it. But users who only wants to run a node to verify what's going on today would not have to concern themselves with that and they'll be able to just process a narrower piece of the chain. So yeah, that's the AP four four four. What about 4337-4337 is the account abstraction. I believe it's going to have a presentation tomorrow. So I highly recommend people watch it.
00:16:12.978 - 00:17:01.374, Speaker B: But account abstraction, this is another one of those things that I've cared about for a long time. Basically it's like making smart contract wallets first class citizens, right? So today's there's two kinds of accounts in Ethereum. There's what we call EOAS, externally owned accounts, which are the accounts that most people have their coins and assets and everything in. And then there are smart contract wallets. Smart contract wallets use smart contract code to be able to impose arbitrary conditions on when the funds can be spent, right? So you can have a multi SIG wallet where you have say, five different keys that might even be controlled by different people and you need three of them to approve a transaction. You could have social recovery wallet where like a three of five can change the key that's needed to sign. You could replace ECDSA with a different signature scheme.
00:17:01.374 - 00:17:53.694, Speaker B: You could replace it with something quantum resistant. You could do a lot of things. But the problem is that smart contract wallets today, smart contract wallets cannot initiate transactions. And so actually using one requires you to have some money in an EOA and you basically just needlessly complicated. And that's a big part of why not many people use it. But then EOAS, they only support one form of authentication, which is one single private key, right? So what 4337 does is basically it's like an extra protocol, second layer way to make smart contract wallets basically be as convenient as EOA wallets are today. And so regular users, it will be much easier to actually have one of these more secure multi SEG or social recovery or whatever kinds of wallets.
00:17:53.694 - 00:18:07.670, Speaker B: And so you would actually be able to feel safe and comfortable using Ethereum without having to worry about what happens if someone hacks my computer and steals my private key or what if my private key gets lost.
00:18:12.030 - 00:18:14.858, Speaker A: Is it just in the implementation phase or kind of how do we think.
00:18:14.864 - 00:18:22.720, Speaker B: About that from just it's already on testnets, but we fear C 4337 is going to be released on the main net fairly soon.
00:18:23.570 - 00:18:47.698, Speaker A: That should change how most of the hackathon projects work. That's going to be awesome. You already touched upon the quality of researches that have kind of come on in the last few years to kind of improve the protocol. But let's kind of zoom out a little bit and go into how do you think the Ethereum Foundation's role has changed in that same window and just kind of from your perspective, what was the role now and how do you think the Role Foundation serves?
00:18:47.794 - 00:19:33.358, Speaker B: I think the Ethereum Foundation, first of all, it has really stepped up on kind of improving its quality, improving its organizational capacity. There's just a lot of things that the Ethereum Foundation was completely not capable of doing just because it did not have people. And there would be lots of people who would just say like, hey, can we do this? And I just unfortunately would not be able to point them to people who can actually do it. And now all of that stuff is just so much better. Right? There's excellent people in the foundation. Steven Gilbert, who has been doing a lot of Latin America work, some other things. Josh Stark has been great at just organizing a whole bunch of things in the foundation core.
00:19:33.358 - 00:20:12.782, Speaker B: And there's this I am a ghochian new executive director, has definitely been great, and both her work kind of organizing the foundation and a lot of the philosophy that she's introducing, I think have been excellent. So just a lot of really good people lately that I'm very happy about. So it's definitely a much more capable organization. It's definitely an organization more capable of starting to have breathing room to think about the long term. Big questions. In 2016 and 17, we barely had breathing room. In 2015, we barely had money.
00:20:12.782 - 00:20:26.574, Speaker B: And then because of barely having money, we barely had people. And then in 2016 and 17, we barely had enough people to do things. And finally, over the last four years, we've really managed to exit that kind of vicious cycle, which has been excellent.
00:20:26.622 - 00:20:39.080, Speaker A: We can actually observe it too, which is the great part. Just the last two years have been phenomenal and just seeing more transparency, the level of effort going into different geographies, just this event itself. Defconnect I absolutely agree.
00:20:39.610 - 00:20:42.470, Speaker B: Yay. Defconnect.
00:20:48.510 - 00:20:58.670, Speaker A: Do you think the Ethereum Foundation should just focus on making the protocol better, or do you think this expands into supporting or collaborating with other protocol?
00:21:00.450 - 00:21:57.326, Speaker B: I think there's definitely room for the Ethereum Foundation to get more involved at the application layer. And I also think that there's more room for everyone except the foundation to get more involved at the protocol layer. Right. To some extent this has happened already, right? But I think for the first couple of years we have had this kind of interesting, sort of like half decentralization, where, no, there's these five different layer two client teams, or way more like five different not layer twos consensus client teams. And there's a lot of layer two teams, there's a lot of execution layer teams, but a big part of a lot of their budgets would still come from the foundation, right? And so it sets up the structure. But the foundation still kind of has this kind of very strong, very central role. But we were already starting to see signs of that diversifying.
00:21:57.326 - 00:22:05.998, Speaker B: We're already seeing signs of actors outside of the foundation supporting all of these different teams, supporting all these different individual developers.
00:22:06.094 - 00:22:10.054, Speaker A: And you're referring to just kind of companies in this space that are companies is one.
00:22:10.172 - 00:22:39.360, Speaker B: Obviously there's consensus there's. The various different Dows, I think, like, Lido announced that they're supporting Protocol Guild, the whole Protocol Guild effort in general, I think the NFT for EIP 1559, and there's, I think, a lot of potential for this to go much further. I think we still need to remember that we are in a world where I believe is this still true? That the uniswap Dow has more capital than the foundation does?
00:22:40.130 - 00:22:48.580, Speaker A: I believe so too. Yeah, I guess. What about collaboration with other layer ones? Do you see a future where we can work with the Bitcoin community?
00:22:49.030 - 00:23:49.334, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. Yeah. Anything can happen. I think coming out of the COVID pandemic, new century, new challenges, it's possibly time to make new friends. Yeah, well, I think especially both the Bitcoin and the ethereum ecosystems are just kind of so different from what they were five years ago, and they're just clearly here do things that are somewhat similar and also somewhat different. And I think there's a queer sign that actually coexistence between these two ecosystems is possible. And I think the big thing that you need for people to feel comfortable cooperating is the feeling that there doesn't exist a kind of neither can live while the other survives a relationship between the two.
00:23:49.334 - 00:24:18.480, Speaker B: Right. Because once people are at their most evil, not out of greed, but out of fear. Right. When people perceive that if they don't fight for their interests and for their own interests, that they're going to lose to some existential threat. That's when people are going to be the most willing to sacrifice everything for their interests. And if the competitive part of the relationship is not an existential one, that already just reduces the temperature. So much technical collaboration is definitely possible.
00:24:18.480 - 00:24:41.270, Speaker B: There's definitely some happening already. The nerds generally, they're happy to kind of ignore the politics and just work on really fun and cool stuff and interpolate the polynomials together, which I think is great, and I think more and more of a very possible over time.
00:24:41.340 - 00:24:52.938, Speaker A: That's great. All right, so for the next section, I'm going to call that Underrated overrated. I'm going to give you a topic you comment on is if this is Underrated overrated, and then a short answer on why.
00:24:53.024 - 00:24:53.610, Speaker B: Sure.
00:24:53.760 - 00:25:00.410, Speaker A: So, 1st, 185 percent hot green tea, 15% red wine, underrated.
00:25:01.550 - 00:25:08.000, Speaker B: Only a few people have heard of it so far. We need to spread this. We need to make it the new thing, the current thing.
00:25:09.730 - 00:25:11.418, Speaker A: We'll try to serve that at midnight.
00:25:11.514 - 00:25:12.160, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:12.610 - 00:25:14.666, Speaker A: One coin, one vote.
00:25:14.858 - 00:25:34.178, Speaker B: I mean, one coin is a scam. I see. Like token voting governance, I think realistically, I think still overrated. I've yelled a lot at it, but I feel like the yelling hasn't really yet translated into people actually seriously experimenting with alternatives.
00:25:34.274 - 00:25:41.546, Speaker A: What's a good framework for thinking about how voting or governance should work overall? It's a very broad, deep question, but specifically for the vote, it is.
00:25:41.568 - 00:26:02.334, Speaker B: I mean, I don't think there's one framework. I think there's a few different frameworks. One of them is collusion resistance, basically, how to prevent concentrated interests from always beating out diffuse interests. Right. Because that's the big problem that always happens in the world. And plutocracy is actually not very good at that. Like, what other things can be.
00:26:02.334 - 00:26:34.018, Speaker B: The second is how to the first one, you can think about it in two ways. You can think about it in kind of like mild ways, where you have the concentrated interest as a fairly tame actor, like, I don't know, paradigm. Paradigm is tame. Right. And the diffuse interest as just, like, random community members. But then on the other end, there's the concentrated interest as, like, a hostile attacker that's like there was that $80 million DFI hack, right? Like someone tried to roll their own stablecoin.
00:26:34.114 - 00:26:35.510, Speaker A: Technically not a hack.
00:26:36.010 - 00:27:06.606, Speaker B: Right? Technically, it was a yellow was it was working as intent. It was a special cryptographic operation. Yeah. So basically what happened there was like there was this someone tried to roll their own stablecoin, and it had a governance token, and the governance token had something like an $80 million market cap. And this is, like, lower than the value of the assets it was protected.
00:27:06.638 - 00:27:08.100, Speaker A: That was the treasury, I believe.
00:27:08.710 - 00:27:17.062, Speaker B: Yeah, the governance tokens was lower than the value of the treasury. And so someone did a flash loan, and they just, like, borrowed 51% of the governance tokens. Right.
00:27:17.116 - 00:27:25.142, Speaker A: And they voted to transfer the money to them as a governance vote, and then they flash loaned it themselves, and it got approved.
00:27:25.286 - 00:27:30.620, Speaker B: Yeah. Right. You want to be resisted to attacks. Right.
00:27:33.310 - 00:27:35.374, Speaker A: Is delay the best way of thinking about that?
00:27:35.492 - 00:27:37.274, Speaker B: Well, I mean, delay is like civil.
00:27:37.322 - 00:27:38.894, Speaker A: Resistance in a different way.
00:27:38.932 - 00:28:07.298, Speaker B: Figure out civil resistance. I think the delay thing can kind of it could help in the short term. It's a Band Aid. In my article, I think it was like moving beyond coin voting governance or something like that. I talk about some longer term financial attacks that can still work no matter what the delays are. So I think it's still concerning. So that's one framework, right, of thinking about collusion and attack resistance.
00:28:07.298 - 00:28:42.820, Speaker B: Another framework is how to ensure that the decisions are high quality. Right. Like, basically, how do you ensure that the people with the governance power actually are people with expertise who actually deserve to have the governance power? And delegation is one of the answers, but delegation might not be the only answer because it's still subject to yeah, I mean, there's like, people who don't know and who know that they don't know, but then there's people who don't know that they don't know. Right. And if they're going to just delegate to peep the frog number 12437, then that's also not the best.
00:28:45.050 - 00:28:53.346, Speaker A: I think we should go on to the rest of the topics because there's a lot more there. PFP. NFTs PFP.
00:28:53.378 - 00:29:24.530, Speaker B: NFT is, I think, a bit overrated, just because the problem is you can clone them. And we don't really have good infrastructure for telling clones apart from not clones and even answering the philosophical question of when is a clone even an illegitimate clone in the first place? And when is it just like a Yodog? That's part of the game. Public goods funding still one of the most important problems in the world, so probably still underrated.
00:29:27.030 - 00:29:30.354, Speaker A: Actually, I have way more questions, so I won't dig into it.
00:29:30.552 - 00:29:36.050, Speaker B: RLP I mean, it's still part of the ethereum protocol, so it's overrated.
00:29:40.230 - 00:29:41.566, Speaker A: Play DOH earn.
00:29:41.758 - 00:29:46.120, Speaker B: Play DOH art like the oh play to earn. Oh, I see.
00:29:47.850 - 00:29:49.066, Speaker A: We can do that.
00:29:49.248 - 00:29:53.690, Speaker B: Art of the Greek philosopher. I definitely would want to see some more plato art.
00:29:53.760 - 00:29:54.380, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:55.390 - 00:30:14.234, Speaker B: Would you have Plato art as your PFP, maybe? Okay. Yeah. Plato earn. I think a bit. Probably a bit overrated. I think the problem that I see with it is that I haven't yet seen a credible story about who would actually be the one that's providing the capital that people end up earning by playing.
00:30:14.282 - 00:30:20.580, Speaker A: Is that an argument for just not having enough time passed or you just mean it's an economically it's just an economic thing.
00:30:21.110 - 00:30:25.410, Speaker B: If you have token outflow, you have to have token inflow. Who's going to pay for the inflow?
00:30:25.850 - 00:30:26.840, Speaker A: Got it.
00:30:28.170 - 00:30:32.994, Speaker B: L two centralization, like centralization of layer two protocols.
00:30:33.042 - 00:30:34.726, Speaker A: Winner take all effects in L two.
00:30:34.748 - 00:31:29.834, Speaker B: S. Well, I guess you have to be clear about what you mean, right? Because one of them is like, oh, what if Fuel gets 95% of the market share, but Fuel becomes super decentralized and then basically have this weird kind of awkward two layer ethereum distinction, but then the other one is like, well, what if there's like five different roll ups, but the sequencers are all run by one guy? The good news about layer two is even the worst outcomes are not as actually necessarily that bad, right. Because you still have trustlessness. As long as the L two S are designed correctly, you still have censorship, resistance. Probably the biggest risk is, like, governance capture. Like, what if the l Two has governance and it does a governance vote and there's too much network effects for people to actually be willing to exit if the governance turns it into something trusted? For example, are you worried about that.
00:31:29.872 - 00:31:32.934, Speaker A: Influencing layer one design in a way that you would not intend?
00:31:32.982 - 00:31:59.026, Speaker B: Or just l Two is influencing layer one design? I mean, possible. I definitely do think that application layers things. It's not necessarily governance. It's not just an L two problem. It's something that could happen in so many different ways. Right. There's going to be a lot of conflicts of interest between different kinds of applications on mean you could.
00:31:59.026 - 00:32:30.910, Speaker B: Go all the way dystopian and know is there going to be some major centralized stablecoin that starts lobbying for the base layer to have KYC. I feel like that one is a bit too blatant and I think too many people would just resist that one very quickly. But there's all kinds of things like that. So I think the answer isn't so much worrying about one specific interest as it is about making sure that the governance as a whole is secure against those kinds of social attacks from all possible concentrated interests.
00:32:32.770 - 00:32:36.682, Speaker A: Last one. Private keys. Underrated or overrated?
00:32:36.746 - 00:33:01.906, Speaker B: Oh, underrated. I mean, you use freaking trying to ban people from having their own personal wallets. Like, come on. Yeah, I think personal wallets where you actually control your private key or it's a social recovery or multi SIG wallet and your family controls some of the keys. That kind of cyber self sovereignty is, I think, like a really important bedrock of having a decentralized crypto ecosystem.
00:33:02.098 - 00:33:03.858, Speaker A: Even with account obstruction?
00:33:04.034 - 00:33:28.302, Speaker B: Even with account obstruction, yes. I think smart contract wallets are not about giving up control. They're about being able to actually choose who to trust, who you can recover. And these things don't even multisig wallets. And social recovery does not have to mean centralization. As I said, you can choose five different friends who don't know each other and have them be your recovery guardians. I actually recommend this.
00:33:28.302 - 00:33:44.340, Speaker B: Right. So there's a lot that you can do with that, but anything like that is far better than an ecosystem where almost all users just interact with the blockchain through a centralized provider where they don't actually control their own access.
00:33:44.970 - 00:33:53.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I think permissionless needs to be truly permissionless. How were the last two years for you? With COVID and.
00:33:57.790 - 00:34:51.260, Speaker B: Definitely the kind of mandatory break of my usual schedule was definitely kind of interesting and fascinating in that before COVID I was basically on a plane on average once every six days. I literally have tracking, and that was my life between about 2014 and 2019. And that obviously had to cut down completely. I was basically holed up in Singapore for about most of a year in the middle of that, and I ended up walking to every district in Singapore. It's a nice small city state, 700 and I think 18 or something square kilometers, I think. Was it somewhere around like 300 freedom units? A bit less, but yeah, Singapore is nice. You can actually do literal cross country running there.
00:34:51.260 - 00:35:20.546, Speaker B: It was also just a good opportunity to kind of think about things, just get quiet work done, but at the same time, also definitely a lot of inconveniences and a lot of serious stuff that I would have rather not had. There were definitely family members that I was just not able to see for a whole year, which I think was really unfortunate and definitely did you pick.
00:35:20.568 - 00:35:21.646, Speaker A: Up any new hobbies?
00:35:21.758 - 00:35:26.150, Speaker B: Did I pick up any new hobbies. I listened to a lot of podcasts.
00:35:28.090 - 00:35:30.790, Speaker A: Any favorites that you want to mean?
00:35:30.860 - 00:35:42.700, Speaker B: Hardcore History was a fun one. Lex Friedman's are a lot of them are very good. There's also Alex friedman's about history. And there's Alex Friedman with the guy who does Hardcore History.
00:35:44.830 - 00:35:45.798, Speaker A: In action.
00:35:45.974 - 00:36:05.134, Speaker B: You can go met on this quite a you know, since then it's like, I think definitely so nice to actually be able to also see people in person and see all of the old friends again that I missed for such a long time.
00:36:05.172 - 00:36:29.430, Speaker A: I think that's one of the really interesting pieces for us today too. There's hundreds of people that have participated at these global events for the last two years which we've never met. And we're seeing so many of them come to us and say hi and us knowing that including some of the youth global employees and team members, we've never seen them until now. And it's awesome to see that. So I'm really glad to hear that. Today is the 22 April. How was your 420?
00:36:29.580 - 00:37:04.770, Speaker B: Oh, let's see. 420 is an important day because 420 is let me explain it. It's the smallest number which is divisible by all the integers from one to seven. It's also the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. So very meaningful number. But anyway, what did I do? I went to a mini internal Ethereum Foundation research workshop and listens to Mary Mallor do an excellent job explaining secrets. A single secret leader election.
00:37:05.770 - 00:37:22.186, Speaker A: Sounds awesome. We've talked enough about the past eats two, the merge. Let's talk about E. Three. What's coming? What are some interesting problems? And what's something exciting that we can share here?
00:37:22.208 - 00:38:07.320, Speaker B: Well, remember, there is no E two and there's definitely no E three. There is the merge, the surge, the verge, the purge, and the splurge. Right. So the Merge, we know, is completing the switch to proof of stake, the surge, massive increase in scaling because of layer twos. And Sharding. So we talked about Dank Sharding, a lot of progress on layer twos here and that's something that we've really seen kind of become alive over the last year or so, right? Like we've basically gone from StarkNet and optimism and arbitram and most of these kind of being theoretical to really being live. I mean, some of them have been around for much longer than a year, right? But it does really feel like the last year has been this amazing and huge tipping point.
00:38:07.320 - 00:39:03.594, Speaker B: So the surge, like really getting kind of the scalability vision kind of fully complete. It is progressing, right? I think very recently, optimism added in support for compression and that noticeably decreased transaction fees by, I think like another something like was it like somewhere between 25 and 40%? Almost half, yeah. So that's amazing. And there are going to be more and more of these, right? Eventually I can replace ECDSA with something else and that can add a lot more compression, eventually protodink sharding a lot more and then full dink sharding a lot more. So I think we're going to see transaction fees on roll ups continue taking steps further and further down over the next couple of years and that'll be amazing. The Verge this is the switch to verkeltrees. Vertical trees are important because they enable stateless clients, which basically means you can verify the chain basically without having anything in your hard drive.
00:39:03.594 - 00:40:00.950, Speaker B: Like you could just verify any random individual block you want without having preexisting information about what happened in the previous block. And that's really important, right? Basically because it makes it much easier to run a validator. It's very good for proof of stake decentralization. It also means that we don't have to worry about the size of the state for a long time. There's always these concerns about oh, are we going to implement state rents and do we have to do that? What happens when the state blows up to a terabyte? But if you have proposal builder separation so we can allow block building to become more specialized market while validators don't even have to run any state at all, they just verify staleless blocks. Then even the state being a terabyte in size is actually manageable, right? So virtue is going to do a lot of good things. Then there is the purge and the purge is basically eliminating cruft.
00:40:00.950 - 00:40:48.042, Speaker B: So we talked about EIP four four four nodes not having the store history anymore. There's like the very long term vision of eventually doing state expiry. So eventually we can also allow even builders to not store old state. Then there is just allowing and making it a norm for Ethereum clients to not have to process and be able to understand. Every single previous version of the protocol is also part of the purge simplifying the Ethereum protocol. So banning self destruct, maybe getting rid of interplacing the 2300 gas stipend, maybe getting rid of interplacing logs because do we really need in protocol bloom filters when basically no one uses that infrastructure and everyone is using the graph anyway, right?
00:40:48.176 - 00:40:49.866, Speaker A: Archive notes will exactly.
00:40:49.968 - 00:41:19.542, Speaker B: At some point, I think you do have to sort of ask that question. What other things are there? Just a lot of simplifications in the ethereum protocol that I think can be made and that I think should be made. And the purge is all of that. And then the splurge is basically all of the other cool stuff. Right. So account abstraction is really big importance, proposal builder separation is really important. And there's this adding VDFS to increase the security of node validator set is also really important.
00:41:19.542 - 00:41:55.326, Speaker B: So a lot of really nice things. And also there is I guess you could put this in the merge bucket because it's also proof of stake, but this longer term idea of moving to single SWOT finality so instead of blocks finalizing after two and a half epochs blocks finalize immediately in the next slot. And this has a bunch of important benefits. There's a bunch of technical reasons why actually it might be easier than we thought. And over the last year or so, we've discovered that there are a lot of just inherent complexities that are difficult to work around.
00:41:55.508 - 00:41:57.614, Speaker A: How do you think about reorgs in that world? I'm just curious.
00:41:57.662 - 00:42:24.858, Speaker B: Yeah. So the point is that reorgs would do not exist unless you're in the special case where a large portion of nodes are offline, and so you're not finalizing. If most of the nodes are online, then you're finalizing. So you can't have reorgs. That's, like, the big benefit. Right. So the thing that we realized over the last year is that there actually are a lot of unavoidable complexities and room for bugs in the way that we combine fork choice rules and finality today.
00:42:24.858 - 00:42:31.930, Speaker B: So moving to single salad just reduces the number of protocols from two to one, and it just makes things so much simpler, potentially.
00:42:32.010 - 00:42:33.470, Speaker A: That'd be huge. That's awesome.
00:42:33.620 - 00:42:38.014, Speaker B: Yeah. Sorry, are we I'm done there.
00:42:38.052 - 00:43:07.078, Speaker A: Okay, final question. We've been part of Ethereum for the last seven years, the bitcoin and just the cryptocurrency ecosystem is around for a little over a decade. How has that evolved from your perspective? The space, whether we're talking about the research or the community or just overall the blockchain space, give us what the last five to ten years have been and kind of how do you see this moving forward for the next five to ten years?
00:43:07.244 - 00:43:28.074, Speaker B: I think the crypto space today is just so different from what it was ten years ago or even five years ago. There's aspects of the old space that I really miss. I definitely miss how it was this kind of very small and niche thing that most people didn't really know about. And even people who did know about it kind of thought that it was a sideshow.
00:43:28.122 - 00:43:38.500, Speaker A: This is an anecdote. Our last event was ETH, London, two years ago. Two years and, like, a month ago. And we were struggling to make that a full house. And that capacity was 300 people.
00:43:39.510 - 00:44:25.300, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. There were definitely these kind of very mysterious and undiscovered aspects of it. Even visiting China and discovering this kind of dark forest of various 16 year olds who have actually been mining bitcoin for four years, ended up already being multimillionaires and quitting high school. There's just, like, a lot of libertarians and socialists peacefully arguing with each other on bitcoin talk and having actually fascinating highbrow conversations. Sometime around this time, I think, is like the 10th anniversary of either the Pirate at 40 hack or Bitcoinica, or maybe both. Like, I forget, who here remembers Pirate at 40? Wow.
00:44:25.300 - 00:44:30.130, Speaker B: Who here remembers Bitcoinica? Zotong.
00:44:32.550 - 00:44:34.222, Speaker A: Give us a little bit of background.
00:44:34.366 - 00:45:21.854, Speaker B: I think it was, like, the first bitcoin leverage trading platform. It ended up just getting hacked over and over again and eventually it just didn't have any money and lots of people got angry. And Pirate at 40 was an anonymous guy running basically like a fund which was like a way of investing in some bitcoin related stuff and getting I think it was like 7% weekly profits. The guy basically said like, hey, trust me. And a bunch of people did trust him. And you know what Mark what Mark Zuckerberg said 20 years ago about people who trust him? So this guy was anonymous. He basically just ended up just like, oh no, he actually did get caught and he did go to jail eventually.
00:45:21.854 - 00:45:33.094, Speaker B: But there's just such crazy stuff happened back then. I mean I guess these days we have different versions of that. We don't have that sort of stuff.
00:45:33.132 - 00:45:35.362, Speaker A: Severity has been slightly minimized.
00:45:35.426 - 00:46:41.586, Speaker B: Well I mean it's like the sizes, like the dollar amounts of crazy stuff that happens are I think about the same but as they have been all along. But as a percentage of the ecosystem it's definitely much smaller. And I definitely think that's good, right? So it's definitely good that the ecosystem has matured and it's definitely grown a lot. People understand a lot, like what actually can be done, what can't be done, what kinds of things make sense in terms of scalability, in terms of privacy, in terms of all of these issues. So I think over the next five to ten years we're going to see the continuation of that process and we're going to see a lot of crypto applications continue to turn into something that's really mainstream and I think there are going to be some costs to that. I think the aspect of the crypto space being this frontier, I don't think that's going to go away. I think crypto is just so hard to control that there's always going to be a frontier within crypto but it's not going to be the case that all of crypto is a frontier anymore.
00:46:41.586 - 00:46:49.438, Speaker B: Right, but at the same time it's hopefully going to be something that just the lots of people use as a.
00:46:49.444 - 00:46:57.694, Speaker A: Regular part of their lives and it's a good future. Before we end any predictions for what the next few years look like?
00:46:57.892 - 00:47:13.670, Speaker B: Oh, the ethereum price will be 12,000, but I won't tell you in what currency could be bolivars, Venezuelan, or it could be doge.
00:47:14.410 - 00:47:16.518, Speaker A: You won't tell us what currency or what base?
00:47:16.604 - 00:48:24.958, Speaker B: Exactly. Yes, and I will tell you if that's 1000 in base ten or base three. So what are the predictions? Basically I think scaling and zero knowledge and smart contract wallets and all that stuff are going to be mature and the ecosystem will then have to basically either succeed on its ability to actually deliver on the applications that people have been expecting for so long or it'll not do that or something in the middle. I do think that blockchains have already proven that they are here to stay and that they do have some value. But there is still this question of like well, in what places exactly? How much? Are we talking the new windows of finance or are we talking the Linux of finance and not just for finance? How does that end up playing out in every other industry? It's still a lot of things that remain open and undecided but I think all of the lovely hackers at the hackathon here and do a lot to try to kind of help make the more positive outcomes happen.
00:48:25.124 - 00:48:29.710, Speaker A: That's a perfect note to end this on. Thank you so much and let's give a big round of applause.
