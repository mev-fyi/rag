00:06:50.700 - 00:07:18.290, Speaker A: The interpretation Service will start. So in terms of the question I have is to Yamastasant from NTT Data. You mentioned in your introduction that you are offering trade vaults which is helping the trade and also manufacturing industry to seek its efficiency. So in terms of the demand that's coming from the market and expectation from the customer in the world of web three, what are your thoughts regarding web trade? Walts was the question.
00:07:20.660 - 00:07:51.560, Speaker B: Hi to Jokyoto still this network moksadi did it so shintoka shintai that's no my Toyota okatis dono yeah KaYOGA faith.
00:07:57.780 - 00:08:25.300, Speaker A: So well, thank you for the question. In terms of the situation surrounding our company, of course when you talk about blockchain, it's more or less a focus on the new technology, the innovation of its technology. But now, as we have seen these recent twelve months, there's a lot of sort of word web three available and familiar in the marketplace. And with that I think there is more stronger relevance to the business and people and expectation from the customers therefore.
00:08:25.380 - 00:08:36.030, Speaker B: Are increasingly point sugar so they are not.
00:08:38.960 - 00:08:49.760, Speaker A: So there's more dialogue and of course a conversation in that manner in the open market, but I think it still is first steps forward. So it's only the very first stage of its beginning.
00:08:50.340 - 00:09:04.400, Speaker C: Nasano ma nihonda to maboek soka says oh motomoto keko mamina sam kimajimani koriskai donuga.
00:09:07.960 - 00:09:23.640, Speaker A: And in terms of the trade and manufacturing which is really the backbone of the Japan economy and do you think that of course the expectation of utilization is increasing in this way of how this technology would be implemented?
00:09:24.620 - 00:09:38.880, Speaker B: Hi faith business Lord and up Denito.
00:09:41.220 - 00:09:47.810, Speaker A: Of course it's increasing but unfortunately has not penetrated fully to its marketplace yet it's gradually tricking into the market.
00:09:48.420 - 00:10:19.400, Speaker C: Hi Asamas tomato masano Mahoni nishonikumara the masano yuiru Pasoni is on shinai Nisho altoism the soretinoa ma tokuni psyching UI nank pasadora IPAN masuanasha mahijoniko Nakawo kitai imagiga animoscado mosano.
00:10:22.220 - 00:10:45.430, Speaker A: So we have a question to hitachi, if I may, in terms of the authentication that you are pursuing without utilizing password, in terms of depending on biometrics and the other. It has been said that Degenerative AI is easy to crack password within 1 minute. So with that I think there's a lot of expectation on Hitachi's technology going forward. So what is your stance right now is the question.
00:10:45.880 - 00:11:00.980, Speaker E: Ariadozamas Eto web Three tokabrokchen nikki user ninja moto kadayo okikuti Hiro Ito Mazda.
00:11:01.980 - 00:11:35.380, Speaker A: First of all, in the world of web three and also convergence of blockchain, when we talk about authentication, it's not just the authentication between the users, but I think it's a whole big realm of scope covering authentication and much deeper. And there are three, one is key management and the second is the authentic authenticating that very person and the third is the convenience of the wallet.
00:11:40.600 - 00:11:56.200, Speaker E: User toyuna koi kagimi so kagi or which natashun Kani eto identity mo shisamo masubitano eto sono Digital.
00:11:59.500 - 00:12:29.490, Speaker A: First of all, in terms of key management, of course in the world of web three, it's more or less depending on the so called the public key. So if you lose them, you will lose the total identity and your asset and everything because it's going to be transparent. And of course with the recently the discussion about DeFi, many of the customers pain points are right there.
00:12:32.460 - 00:12:48.040, Speaker E: Tos and Etokinucho kankashi maskedo and Honey kakuni oshi kariyari Bashimo.
00:12:50.640 - 00:13:19.200, Speaker A: And in terms of authentication, the truth of the authentication, of course there are a lot of regulatory requirements under the FSA and Financial Service Agency, the other authorities as well. This aspect is, of course, to legitimately have a strong authentication at the same time offer conveniences. And in terms of meeting these three areas of the convenience and also on the authentication of the public, it's said to be trilemma.
00:13:22.540 - 00:13:40.920, Speaker E: Desktop phrase no to candy Monday morning, hide the night inclusion Monday.
00:13:41.760 - 00:14:00.770, Speaker A: And in terms of the wallet, there's an issue with inclusion because the setup is quite complicated. You need to open an account and also you need to go through the past processes, which is quite complicated unless you are very much first with utilizing smartphone. So inclusivity is another area of issue with a wallet issue.
00:14:11.140 - 00:14:14.120, Speaker E: The more public bintric infrastructure.
00:14:27.200 - 00:14:43.570, Speaker A: And in order to solve this issue, we are trying to combine biometrics and password together in the notion of PBID, isn't it? PBI PBI public ID infrastructure biometric infrastructure biometric infrastructure excuse me. So therefore we'll be able to overcome all these pain points.
00:14:45.460 - 00:14:48.160, Speaker C: Dangerous Hi Arizonas.
00:14:51.940 - 00:14:54.850, Speaker E: Hi toshti and.
00:14:58.260 - 00:14:58.636, Speaker C: Pray.
00:14:58.668 - 00:14:59.680, Speaker E: As antichrist.
00:15:02.540 - 00:15:13.050, Speaker A: And as you have said, the convenience is a very large issue and it is very true. Many of the customer that we have contacted with, they are all concerned about the convenience of this technology.
00:15:14.060 - 00:15:41.360, Speaker C: The Masono Maui sono honey Nisho choosing to start some device ma mano suno idea mano Nandi.
00:15:43.560 - 00:16:08.060, Speaker A: And in terms of turning to Fujitsu, you're alluding to other area of solution set in overcoming this problem. In other words, the conversion gateway handling with multiple authentication technology. So I hear that you have a POC running with a university at the moment. So what is your EU feel in terms of the expectation of the market and the current situation overall?
00:16:08.720 - 00:16:24.000, Speaker D: Boom sangata Identity to yohanaiktirukanati image so image whatever A-K-O dai gakutiyata.
00:16:34.200 - 00:17:06.250, Speaker A: So there's a tremendous amount of hype around distributed ID, and that is one of the endeavors we have with Eko University running the POC at the moment. And we also have an early initiative with a Web so trusted Web demonstration or POC initiative. We also have some of the working relationship with that entity. So I would say that the market expectation is gradually increasing at the moment.
00:17:07.180 - 00:17:23.760, Speaker C: All um moriaga teru nakasaidanoa nambarisore candice terrierimo ano ma Nandisha bung sangatanista hoai brasso sono die from candidate.
00:17:25.780 - 00:17:32.320, Speaker D: Identity kihon identity of Jihungati kandi so eto katachika torah.
00:18:04.900 - 00:18:46.904, Speaker A: So I think the expectation is, as you have said, Sakamoto san, there's a lot of interest in the market. And why do you feel that way? And the answer from Sakamoto san is that in terms of the distributed notion, distributed management in itself is not that it's convenient, but rather I think it's something that is coming from the government initiative rather than the private sector because in the EU there is ID wallet and there's a lot of regulations associated with that. So that is with of course, the Trusted Web Three as well. So it's more of not a pull from the private company, but rather a push from the government side.
00:18:47.102 - 00:19:22.280, Speaker C: Quite nangai state omotano tori Tabamo tokujini ID Okandi through disco mita and amonomo Dondong soy nomokini Sorega jibundanokandi there nanka Koduka nakatam soyu nomo ate nagakobun sancha and satakai mono keikotino nakariona kiga shimasketomo.
00:19:25.740 - 00:20:27.050, Speaker A: My feeling is that in terms of what we see today. The distributed sort of a notion is that if you are to manage and also take control of the ID in a proprietary manner, we see a lot of personal information that is now abundant in the marketplace. And if you are to be compromised in any way, you are going to be held responsible and accountable rather than that, I think it's better to have a distributed approach, which may be much, much safer. So do you think that is the reason why there's a tremendous amount of interest in SSI and did and for the enterprises not to be held 100% accountable for the data that they manage and own?
00:20:27.780 - 00:20:41.572, Speaker E: Hi antara karakojinga jivuno jivuno de Kondoro is so you know someone?
00:20:41.626 - 00:21:21.520, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think the situation is now quite transient because it will not, therefore, unfortunately yet leave to the notion of self sovereignty. That is a little far. So we're in in between at the moment. So that's the problem area that we see, and of course a major trend where we are heading for is towards the distributed and also self sovereignty. But I think there are two drives.
00:21:23.540 - 00:21:24.560, Speaker E: Regulation.
00:21:25.860 - 00:21:30.080, Speaker A: And one is a Sakamoto sound from Fujitsu mentioned it's the regulation.
00:21:40.900 - 00:21:42.210, Speaker E: Identity no kind.
00:22:00.800 - 00:22:29.010, Speaker A: The other, of course, drive is the interest in reestablishing or restructuring a new business model. In other words, in terms of ID management, we will need to foresee how this frictionless management of ID will lead to a new monetization of the creation of the ecosystem. Many companies are struggling with this very issue, and if there could be a breakthrough, I think that is going to be a very big next step.
00:22:29.460 - 00:22:54.330, Speaker C: Hi asanas Masono masani sonos Santora Saturni Makiyoga Madhano Kandi of Tan to riskano sono Torik maritukai Demo masani sono discutino arukarako his own.
00:22:56.140 - 00:23:22.756, Speaker A: So as Sakamoto san from Pojitsu and Takai san from Hitachi have mentioned this very notion that the organization would be held responsible for the abundance of the personal information that is increasing in the market. There's a lot of tremendous amount of risk and a tremendous amount of burden. And I think Kawasaki san, who is also taking an important role within the Setagaya City Setagaya Ward, I think that's another issue that also concerns you, I would assume.
00:23:22.908 - 00:23:25.668, Speaker E: Hi Ariodoza masano Shartori and the skill.
00:23:25.684 - 00:24:01.036, Speaker B: Domo and Kanjiranoa Chihoji must say fuck so high shi sindoka and a paper minus naga Shinato Damiring so you rebiran?
00:24:01.068 - 00:24:01.216, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:01.238 - 00:24:03.520, Speaker B: Mataku and tasty night. You know the Mazda?
00:24:04.280 - 00:24:38.076, Speaker A: And of course I'm taking part in the Setagaya Award Setagaya City role in pursuing digital transformation. But it's far, far beyond from reaching the discussion of Web three. You may be surprised that many of course, the agenda for us is to not use facsimile fax anymore or try to achieve paperless working load. And even the PC within the city wall is not directly connected to the internet. This could be quite surprising for you. So we need additional procedures in order to do so. So we are far from behind in terms of talking about key management.
00:24:38.076 - 00:26:19.660, Speaker A: That's too sophisticated. But of course, the other hand, I'm worrying as an attorney and as a lawyer, many of the customers are indeed concerned with the risk associated with the increasing amount of personal information that needs to be managed by the corporation. And of course, that really is a pain point. So we do hear those issues from our clients. And I have a question, if I may, in terms of what Tatakaisa mentioned. Hitachi I completely agree about the two drivers and lever here in terms of the regulatory requirements, at the same time creating a new business model, of course, the most important thing is how we can create this new business model. But I think to that end, from NTT Data yamastasan at his introductory comment, he mentioned that already some of the solutions that from NTT Data is implemented overseas and having success stories.
00:26:19.660 - 00:26:22.930, Speaker A: So I would like to hear more from NTT Data.
00:26:26.210 - 00:26:44.110, Speaker B: Hi to matoto Quinn. Italian. I see a to business, Joan, known as Miyagati maturi.
00:26:45.370 - 00:27:02.070, Speaker A: And of course there are several country examples, but not all of them are consistent. In case of Italy, the customers have lost a lot of efficiency and the cost of running the business accumulating too high, so they needed a solution set desperately.
00:27:09.010 - 00:27:21.950, Speaker B: The Saiyanaka Kodato, you know, it and Motika Ikini.
00:27:30.070 - 00:27:52.680, Speaker A: And also we have a case in Japan as well, but it's not that we have a clear sort of a set of a business model and we discern that from the very beginning. That's not how we work. It's quite kind of we establish a hypothesis and inference and then we try many things out and through the trial and error, we try to achieve the ideal state. So that's how we are working.
00:27:54.650 - 00:28:11.070, Speaker C: Mano kiwarisono nandisho mo and mokandiga mo SOMO so mo naka Shimita Masoma deko Imano Namaso.
00:28:14.630 - 00:28:28.310, Speaker A: So maybe is it that the management itself here in Japan have not been acknowledged as being too complicated or too difficult yet? So do you think that is the reason of the slow uptake of these technologies?
00:28:33.850 - 00:28:50.030, Speaker B: Hi so dude, NASCAR game second Dinash.
00:28:52.130 - 00:29:14.510, Speaker C: Hi dasaroki Masono minasani kanye nanka Kotoshi nankako koi nanka koi Gizzit Stoka mako nanika Mahori nanikani up there. Novisona novisona nang.
00:29:21.130 - 00:30:01.886, Speaker A: So, first of all, the answer from is that yes, I think that's very true. And they all have a legacy system that they have all developed through the long years of rulemaking and they do not feel this new transition of technology as being a must or mandatory yet. So that is the reason, and the question from Ishi san to the rest of the group is that in the next six months, do you think there is new technology or new regulatory requirements or some kind of trigger in order to create another stage of breakthrough for this technology? If you have anything, please share that with us. So this is a question to all.
00:30:01.908 - 00:30:09.346, Speaker C: The group off the yeah, those are just heighton.
00:30:09.378 - 00:31:13.830, Speaker D: Geo hanakatam Idon you know, IDA, you know the so the what do I identity of Moto to Skyrim? I cut on the what can you say to go back point to narrative internet identity? Ottawa eto cocai suroni suita is your mitana eto miskijo homita identity otkit kerotoka so identity otskete due to the internet due to Sasira identity hoping cut to your sariamo in Arun janaika whatever kingdom.
00:31:15.450 - 00:31:19.760, Speaker C: Fakes and.
00:31:21.650 - 00:31:28.670, Speaker D: So you know Kitaku Kyojuga identity.
00:31:32.610 - 00:32:26.160, Speaker A: So this is answer from Sakamoto san? Yes. At the moment, business wise, I think the discussion is only closed within the ID management within a certain wall of organization or entity. So what we need to do in terms of making identity more useful in the bigger sort of a landscape is that what we are at the laboratory doing right now. In other words, the data on the internet need to be tagged with a certain ID or translated into an ID and then made public. What I mean by that is a lot of news source that are running on the internet, if you can authenticate them that they are not the fake news, I think that is going to be highly trustworthy and convenient. So if they can say that this news is originating from a university professor then we would be able to authenticate that this news is not a fake. So that could be one of the trigger point.
00:32:33.650 - 00:34:26.230, Speaker E: So Desna maywade but Nftoniko shinda IO do and okoyoshiko Kamita JCBI and Kamo ectomasi JC whatever the JC mo et so technology no container technology of doka tattoo bar so this name to yaku no disney. You know, top percentage. But still hagar isn't born with naruto destination. That the tokoro motoko digital technology chanto. Show me the Guinness name. Tashkai honinga. And a science degree.
00:34:26.230 - 00:35:00.080, Speaker E: Casseca de Kira. And south by south. Vesto naka demo so Teson josh diktadiko hanno jojo Nakana so. Itato karadesna Tarashi. She jokes. Good TikTok no? And so in her work with.
00:35:03.930 - 00:36:21.130, Speaker A: Think there are many opportunities moving forward. And in terms of the NFT, of course there are a lot of issues with NFTs under the limelight at the moment. Sometimes NFTs are fake or maybe broken and of course with a rampant sort of a technological digitalization of the economy, it was a hype maybe to last year, but I think that the hype itself is diminishing because of there are a lot of faults and failure. So I think what's important is how we would be able to attach trust to its architecture and I think this initiative is also undertaken by the JCBI in terms of how you are going to create the flow of the trust attached to these information. But I think if we can do that, I think there will be a tremendous opportunity for a higher uptake of this technology overall. Another thing that is important is not technical but rather creation of the community center around the so called fan, the royal fans and that also links up to our initiative of the Biometric, the PBI technology of how identity could be managed as well. And if we can apply this technology maybe in terms of let's say the professional baseball player Otani has signed or autographed on his ball are going to be exchanged on the NFT site.
00:36:21.130 - 00:36:43.920, Speaker A: But if we can authenticate the fact that it's truly being signed by Otani, maybe his face or fingers or some kind of a biometric element that could be reflected in the E certificate, then I think we'll bring about a lot of trustworthiness within NFT. So we also at Hitachi have exhibited at the south by Southwest exhibition the other day and there was a tremendous amount of interest.
00:36:44.490 - 00:36:45.240, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:51.610 - 00:37:01.110, Speaker B: Backend and holiday to Safdik took you know yeah he didn't know think mamba jotai, Hoga, Kaiji, Sarah and so Hoga due to the Kiris.
00:37:03.210 - 00:37:04.440, Speaker C: Privacy control.
00:37:09.010 - 00:37:10.510, Speaker B: Maimato NFD.
00:37:21.090 - 00:37:45.800, Speaker A: So I think it's sort of a back end side. I think we need to make sure that there is not going to be a trough or the cliff in terms of the information that is being linked together between Company and also in terms of the second aspect is a wallet that we although call it a wallet. Maybe this notion of wallet will go away and it's going to be blended into our actual daily lifestyle. So that I think will be a big driver and opportunity for us in the next six months.
00:37:46.330 - 00:37:48.070, Speaker C: Hi etodoa.
00:37:51.530 - 00:37:54.440, Speaker A: Since this time like to conclude this session. Thank you.
00:37:58.410 - 00:38:04.640, Speaker C: If you have any question, we have the network party after the twelve, so yeah, please ask.
00:38:05.010 - 00:38:09.520, Speaker A: They will be available at the reception so if you have any question, please grab hold of them. Thank you.
00:38:11.090 - 00:38:14.906, Speaker B: Hi, Ariatoja. Hakshu.
00:38:15.018 - 00:38:17.150, Speaker D: Hi, Krasite.
