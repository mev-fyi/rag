00:00:26.840 - 00:03:27.384, Speaker A: Ram sam. Sam. Always Sam. Saturday afternoon.
00:03:27.432 - 00:04:01.952, Speaker B: Good evening, everybody. My name is Kartik, one of the co founders of Ethg Global, and I'm super excited to welcome all of you to the Super Hack finale. Let's get started. You're all watching this thing on ETHGlobal TV. This is what we're going to be using for today to talk to all of you and share any comments. And also, anybody who signs in and kind of interacts with the rest of the live stream will also be getting a PO app for participating at this event. It so, SuperHack was hosted by ETH Global, and our goal and our mission is to onboard thousands of developers into the broader Web Three ecosystem.
00:04:01.952 - 00:04:33.020, Speaker B: And we do this by running hackathons and summits, both in person and Async. And for SuperHack. For the last two weeks, we did just exactly that. This was an Async event for us. We hosted an incredible summit telling you all the things that are happening in the world of Op stack and super chains. We got to learn from what's happening with optimism, sello mode, base and uniswap to kind of just get some insights into how they're thinking about a MultiChain l Two world. But the next hour and a half is about the hackathon.
00:04:33.020 - 00:05:32.450, Speaker B: So let's tell you all that's happened in the last week. This has been a massive and incredible event for us. We've had over 1150 hackers from 87 different countries participating, and they worked and came from 26 different unique time zones just to see where everybody was on. From a map, we kind of saw representations from six different continents, and it's incredible to see all the amazing things that everybody was excited about and all the things that you built. Submissions were due on Sunday, and we're going to talk about all the things that came out of it. Not only just the hackers, we had 68 ecosystem partners who were the brightest and the best people in the Op l Two super chain world, and they were there to help and see what all of you can do. We also had six dedicated ecosystem mentors who were there twenty four seven to help answer all of your questions, whether it was feature requests, bug reports, or understanding how they can help you get unblocked for your project.
00:05:32.450 - 00:06:21.440, Speaker B: And what today is all about is showing you all the things that came out of it and giving away $175,000 in prizes. So we're going to talk about all the things that everybody's going to win and has won, and especially through all of our amazing partners. So before we get into all of these things, I want to give a quick shout out to all of our 14 incredible partners. We have optimism, WorldCoin, Zora, base, hyperlain layer, zero mode, chain link, safe, the, graph, ether, scan, EAS, conduit and Covalent. So 1155 hackers submitted and worked on 295 incredible projects. This was a huge number of things for us to see, review and look at and give feedback on. And I was personally super excited to see all the incredible things.
00:06:21.440 - 00:07:01.196, Speaker B: We looked at hundreds of these projects, saw hundreds of demos, and we're going to talk about everything that came out of it. So on Sunday, everybody submitted these. Monday and Tuesday, we did our judging. And from these 295 projects, we have ten finalists who are going to come here on this live stream and tell you about what they built and do a live demo of their projects. So we're going to bring them on one by one, and they're going to show you everything that they built over the course of this hackathon. And after that, we're going to go into all the prizes. So I want to quickly give a massive shout out to our ten amazing finalists.
00:07:01.196 - 00:07:56.032, Speaker B: I want to congratulate Shadow roll up shortcuts. Clingsafe a testament per capita globecraft dirt Star CCIP refer on chain review and super search. These ten teams are going to come on and demo everything and we're going to quickly get started. But before we show you the very first demo, I want to take a quick second to thank the 285 teams listed here for working on something absolutely incredible, submitting it, and getting people to give you feedback. Coming on a call to show this to our judges, answering questions, clarifying things on how you did it, why you built it, and what you're excited about, and why you got excited about all these things. Just because you were not one of those ten teams does not mean you were not good enough. We really want to make sure that you have an opportunity and a platform to better yourselves, learn interesting things, get better at coding, designing, anything that you're excited about, from research to applications in this space.
00:07:56.032 - 00:08:47.708, Speaker B: And you have an avenue to effectively continue to better yourself. So to any of you here, if you're still interested in continuing to build your project, you are more than welcome to paying us for additional feedback or introductions to anybody you want, whether it's some of our judges or some of our partners or some VCs or whatever you are looking for in this space. If there's something we can do as Ethcobal, we'd be more than happy to help. So please continue building after this event ends, because the goal here is to get more people to try out everything that's possible in Web Three. And for those of you who are watching this thing on the live stream, all of you can head over to Ethgoba.com showcase to see all 295 of these projects. You can see all the information about what they built, screenshots, some video demos, some live demos, URLs, and all the details around why they built it and how it works under the hood.
00:08:47.708 - 00:09:17.416, Speaker B: So be sure to check that out. And with that, let's get started. So all of you here who are hacking and hacked. Just before you kind of call this event finish, I want to take a quick second to remind all of you that we'd really appreciate it if you can take two minutes to click on that link on your dashboard and give us some feedback. There's a few questions there. Very simple yes no rating out of ten. Just helps us really understand what worked well, what didn't work well, so we can make the next event better for the next thousand people.
00:09:17.416 - 00:09:45.008, Speaker B: And this is the kind of feedback we're looking for to get better. And we want to make sure that we are able to help make this experience better for you and that everybody else who comes and participates in everything that we do moving forward. So please take the time to just do this thing. It'll take you a quick minute, and we really appreciate it. All right, enough of me talking. It's time for our very first demo. So without further ado, I'd like to bring on our very first finalist for today, and that is Team A Testament.
00:09:45.008 - 00:09:54.710, Speaker B: So with that, please welcome A testament on the live stream. Hello. Hello. Feel free to get started.
00:09:59.580 - 00:10:25.104, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. My name is Diane, and we're a testament. We're here to ensure that NFT funds are used responsibly. Rugs happen every day. Here's just one example of where the founder mysteriously died only two minutes after the collection sold out. Well, there goes that roadmap, along with all the money. In fact, rugs happen so often, it results in over $2.8
00:10:25.104 - 00:10:56.520, Speaker C: billion in losses. This makes it hard for even good creators to stand out. A testament comes from the word testament, which means tangible evidence. We've developed a smart vault where creators can fulfill their promises and token holders can attest to fund to unlock the funds. This allows creators to build trust and onchain credibility, while users can back projects with confidence. This is how it works. Creators verify their World ID and fill out the roadmap.
00:10:56.520 - 00:11:34.556, Speaker C: They deploy an NFT contract on Zora. Along with a vault, a user also verifies their World ID and can now mint the NFT. With an NFT in their wallet, the user can attest to the project's, completeness. When enough attestations are received, the funds are unlocked. Otherwise, the funds are frozen until a new milestone can be reached. Attestment scores are available publicly via the graph. The score acts like business credit, so companies like Inferra or Chainlink can actually offer discounts to trustworthy projects.
00:11:34.556 - 00:12:18.000, Speaker C: The score uses a weighted formula, and it's actually inspired by a charity rating agency. Now, let me show you a live demo. Here we have our dashboard. I'm going to start by connecting my MetaMask and World ID. This ensures that only unique individuals can mint NFTs and create projects. Below, you can see the collections that I currently hold and projects that I can mint to support. Now, let's say I want to raise money to save the planet.
00:12:18.000 - 00:13:10.940, Speaker C: I'm going to create a new project for my milestone. I promise to plant about 8000 trees by September 9. And to unlock the funds, I'll be required to reach at least 50% of the minted supply in Attestations. Now I'm going to upload a JPEG. And to keep things simple, we'll have two NFTs in this collection. Let's click finish sign and TADA. My NFT contract has been deployed.
00:13:10.940 - 00:14:50.200, Speaker C: Now let's go back to our dashboard and mint an NFT. It's reassuring knowing that the funds are going directly to a vault here and not to the creator's wallet. Okay, I'm going to refresh the page. Just give me 2 seconds. There we go. Okay, we can now attest to the project. You can currently see that there are zero Attestations, but once the milestone is reached, we can Attest.
00:14:50.200 - 00:16:01.430, Speaker C: Perfect. Now, going into the collection, you can now see that there's one Attestation and we can claim funds. Let's verify the Attestation a few seconds ago. Attestation complete. Okay. And finally, once a milestone has been completed, collections are also given an Attestment score, which acts like a credit score. In the future, Attesters will also get a positive score for Attesting to projects.
00:16:01.430 - 00:16:10.860, Speaker C: We're a testament. We ensure that NFT funds are used responsibly. Thanks for watching.
00:16:15.550 - 00:16:35.300, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for being our very first demo for the day. And it was a little bit risky, but it worked out. Everything was great. And it's one of those ethics where just the demo gods may not always be in your favor, but congratulations and hopefully we all get to see this thing live.
00:16:35.910 - 00:16:36.900, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:16:37.670 - 00:16:47.800, Speaker B: All right, we are ready for our second demo for the day. And for this, I'd like to bring on Shadow. Roll up. So, Paco, whenever you're ready.
00:16:51.130 - 00:17:50.140, Speaker D: Hello, I'm Paco Bytes, and I've been working on Shadow Rollup. So Shadow Rollup is an Op stack roll up that retrives another roll up from layer one. I will explain what that means later, but it does it with a different execution engine. And the way this execution engine is different is that it does everything normally, but it also tracks the gas usage of every smart contract and it stores it on chain. So a section of onchain storage is dedicated to having this index with how much gas every contract has used. And given that this is on chain and this is mostly a normal Opista colab, we should be able to do a fault proof for it, and then we can make this data trustlessly available in our chain of choice. So before getting into the demo and deeper into how this works, let's think about why this might be interesting.
00:17:50.140 - 00:18:41.178, Speaker D: So first, it's sort of a proof of concept for measuring on chain impact on chain. So let's say you are optimism or base, and you want to incentivize smart contract developers to build in your ecosystem so you can decide to give them a share of sequencer fees in proportion to how much their contracts are used. And by using something like shadowlab you could do that trustlessly. Next, you can even generalize this indexing to something that's general purpose. So something like the graph but on chain where you can do any sort of indexing you can put on chain without having to put it in your actual contract. You do the shadow roll up thing and then you fold proof everything. And then sort of putting both of these things together.
00:18:41.178 - 00:19:31.002, Speaker D: You can even do something like relatively neutral airdrops. So instead of having one centralized entity put together this merkel tree with the recipients of the AirDrop, you can come up with a sibling resistant algorithm, put it in a shadow roll up whether I one chain with it and then fold proof it. And then you decide the token distribution this way. So now into how it works. When I say we are deriving a roll up from layer one, what I mean is actually very simple. So with normal op stack roll ups, users can send transactions either directly to layer one or they can send them to a sequencer which is cheaper. Then the sequencer puts a bunch of transactions together and sends them to L one.
00:19:31.002 - 00:20:24.362, Speaker D: The takeaway from this is that everything ends up in layer one eventually. So my shadow roll up takes advantage of this to read all of the transactions that have gone through this roll up premium layer one and execute everything again, almost like a validator, but with this modified execution engine which keeps track of gas usage. Then for the proofs, it's very similar to the sort of thing you would do to withdraw tokens from, let's say optimism into mainnet. So first you need fault proofs for the state root. And once you have that, users can make storage proofs for specific pieces of data, which instead of being tokens in this case would be this gas usage metric for every contract. So now I'm going to show you a demo of this. I will be focusing only on the second part.
00:20:24.362 - 00:21:02.546, Speaker D: So we will assume that we have fault proof stone some other way. We will be running a layer two and we will be running the shadow roll up which indexes the gas usage in this layer two. And then we will be doing storage proofs from this indexer back into the original layer two. So let's jump into it. So you can see for this, this is actually an optimism redeploy contract. You can see how much gas it's been using according to the indexer. This is how much we have most recently proven and this is what we've actually tracked.
00:21:02.546 - 00:21:26.240, Speaker D: So I'm actually going to show another contract. You see it hasn't used much gas. Now I'm going to click update. This is going to generate storage proof and it's going to send it to layer one. So you can see here. Now the two values are the same. And actually if we wait a few seconds, we should see something move here.
00:21:26.240 - 00:21:56.700, Speaker D: Given that this contract we are sending the Torch proof to is the same contract we are seeing here, this might take a few seconds. Oh, here it is. So you can see the indexer has caught up to the normal roll up. And given that we sent a transaction to that roll up to make some proof, now that validating. That proof takes gas. So now we can see that reflected in the indexer. So you see these numbers are different again.
00:21:56.700 - 00:22:08.010, Speaker D: So this is my demo. If you are interested in learning more, you can go to The Real Bytes on Twitter. And that's it for me.
00:22:08.080 - 00:22:08.940, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:22:11.570 - 00:22:37.590, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for that amazing devtool. I think this just makes debugging and just actually simulating things a lot easier. So hopefully all of us also get to play with it and hopefully continue to build continue actually building this. Congrats. All right, we are now ready for our third finalist demo, and that is Project Clink Safe. So without further ado, let's welcome Penny on the stage.
00:22:39.130 - 00:22:54.714, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. This is Panith. Let me introduce Clink. Clink simplifies sharing crypto assets with just a link. Let's get started with a small story. Here I introduce Tim. Tim is planning to send a crypto gift to his best friend.
00:22:54.714 - 00:23:18.322, Speaker A: His best friend is none other than very famous Bruce. Sending a crypto gift is very easy. Only if Bruce had a wallet address. But Bruce is a newbie in the Web Three world, so he doesn't have a crypto wallet. So Tim asked Bruce to set up a new crypto wallet. Little did he realize this process can be very painful. Why? Because Bruce had so many questions.
00:23:18.322 - 00:23:57.882, Speaker A: What is this twelve words. What is private key? What is public address? What is chain? On and on. Tim became so frustrated with all these questions we all can imagine in Tim's situation. When we tried to onboard a new user into the Web Three, tim became so disappointed that he started wondering why it is so difficult to onboard a new user into the Web Three. He just wanted to send a crypto gift to his friend. If a single user like Bruce is facing so much of difficulty, then what about the next billion user we are planning for? But what can be done? Let's watch a demo. Here we can see link is already loaded.
00:23:57.882 - 00:24:22.840, Speaker A: We can see the chest image which symbolizes it can store crypto assets in it. Let's click on setup chest and create a gift card. Here we can see sign in with Google which actually helps anybody to sign up easily. Let's click on sign in with Google and select Tim's account. Here we can see the team account. We'll select it. Now we are trying to log in Tim.
00:24:22.840 - 00:24:46.270, Speaker A: Here we can see that Smart account is getting settled up. We can see the wallet got loaded. We can see some balance in his account. If you want to deposit more, we can just click here and connect an external wallet and deposit. Or we can send it directly to the public address. Important thing to notice here, this is not just another wallet. It's a smart contract deployed on chain.
00:24:46.270 - 00:25:19.738, Speaker A: If we go into the basecam, we can see it as a contract deployed on chain and we can verify the balance. Now let's create a crypto gift card worth of $100. Let's click on Create link here. The transaction has begun processing under the hood. We are trying to create a new wallet and trying to transfer the amount into the new gift card. Now the transaction is getting verified. So now we can see the chest got created and we can see the $100.
00:25:19.738 - 00:25:40.138, Speaker A: Now Tim can share this directly with Bruce. You can just click here and share it directly with any of this platform. Or you can just copy this and share it directly. Let's copy this link and head over to Telegram to share it with Bruce. We can see the Bruce account here. Now Tim will share this with Bruce. So the message is sent.
00:25:40.138 - 00:26:07.814, Speaker A: Now let's switch to the Bruce account here. We can see the Bruce account. Now Bruce will receive the link. He'll just open that link. Now Bruce sees $100 worth of gift card. Now he can decide to save this in the same gift card and keep it with him, or he can claim it whenever the Bruce is ready, he can click on Claim and connect an external valid and claim it. Or he can just directly send it to a public address.
00:26:07.814 - 00:26:31.086, Speaker A: Or if he wants to transfer to the bank, he can do that. Now let's see connecting an external valid, how we can claim it. Let's click on external valid. Now we can see the valid got connected. It was already connected. So the claim is also initiated. So here we are trying to create a smart contract wallet and we are trying to transfer the amount in the gift card to the Bruce address.
00:26:31.086 - 00:26:59.862, Speaker A: Now, if we see the Bruce current address here in the extension, it is having only $1. Now in the background, we can see the just got claimed. And if you go into the transaction hash, we can see the details. And if we come back, if we go to the specific account, we can see it as a contract. It got created and the amount got transferred. Now if Bruce sees the balance again, he can see the $100 which is claimed. Bruce is happy he got an under dollar.
00:26:59.862 - 00:27:30.270, Speaker A: Tim is also happy because he was able to facilitate this. Now let's get back to the presentation. So on the tech stack, we have built this on base. Without base, we wouldn't have the cheaper transaction and faster transactions. Account abstraction is done to the Safe Core SDK and everything is built on next. And we are using Gelato for relaying the transactions and we have used valid Core and Web three Auth as well. So what is next for Prink? So I have divided into two phases.
00:27:30.270 - 00:27:58.906, Speaker A: In the phase one I'm planning for the enhancements like security encryption of the wallets and UX improvement for community engagement rewards. And in the phase two I'm planning to have reward system and gas sponsorship and also expand the offerings in the platform like on and off Ram solution or more token supports or Dex integration. That is it. Thanks everyone. Thanks for the ETH Global team for making this happen. Thanks for the judges for their valuable feedback. If you want to use Clink, you can just scan this.
00:27:58.906 - 00:28:02.800, Speaker A: Or if you want to connect with me, just head over to Telegram. Thanks everyone.
00:28:05.090 - 00:28:27.960, Speaker B: Amazing. Thank you so much for that awesome demo and it's a great example to actually make things more consumer ready. So hopefully all of us get to try this and everybody watching on the live stream. Be sure to check it out. Congrats. All right, with this we are ready for our fourth finalist demo for today and that is Project Globe Grafter. So let's welcome them on screen.
00:28:30.810 - 00:28:57.390, Speaker F: Hello. Can I start? Hi everyone. My name is Damien. I'm presenting our project global grafter. Shout out to my partner Noah. I know you have been working your ass off to raise your family and still manage your time to participate this hackathon with me. Really appreciate it.
00:28:57.390 - 00:29:59.970, Speaker F: And what we built in past ten days is a Map generator for all Onchain games in Web three. In order to show how Global Grafter works, we have also built a roguelive game with this Onchain Map generator. We have deployed both our Map Generator and roguelike games contracts on Optimism mod base as well as Zora network and our Map Generator. Global Graft mainly consists of two important parts of the code. First part of the code is what we code to generate corridors and rooms. As you can see here, it's randomly generated ones and zeros which draws out the floor. Your role in the game can walk and the walls of the rooms.
00:29:59.970 - 00:30:56.850, Speaker F: Since the Verifiable random function from chainlink has not been supported by Op network, we wrote our own algorithm to generate random numbers to assure that all the routes are different in the map based on the number of rooms and the size of the map. If the Onchain gaming Map generator is too abstract, you can also try our ROG live game. It's pretty simple to test the game. Basically, you type rogue and connect to your wallet. There's a hero randomly generated in the game. It's a play to die type of game and each hero has four main characters. On the up left part there's attack your health points, your experience and the goals.
00:30:56.850 - 00:31:38.050, Speaker F: The number of goals you can find it also shows the location of your hero. So while you exploring the gradually generated map, you will find more goats. You will also cross dwarfs. But if you don't have higher attacks, you will be killed by the monster that you encounter in the game. That's what happened in the Rock Live game. So after completing the game, after your hero dies, it requires you to sign and upload all the game data on Chain. You need to sign twice.
00:31:38.050 - 00:32:42.940, Speaker F: So basically all the gaming data is on Chain. You can find the data and your performance on the graph here. And we also utilize ZK snark. We also utilize ZK Snark to avoid any cheating happen in the game. So here is a code of the ZK Snark we utilized in this game. So if your experience in the game exceeds 5000 in our log like game, you will get a rare NFT generated on Zora network and all your gaming performance and your performance coding will be coded in this NFT. That's all about our global grafter and the gaming map generator.
00:32:42.940 - 00:32:45.230, Speaker F: That's all. Thank you.
00:32:47.280 - 00:33:02.320, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much for that demo. And it's a cool way to look at more practical gaming applications of Snarks. And this is even more creative when you kind of end up doing your own randomness algorithm. So this is really fun. And congrats to you and your team member.
00:33:02.480 - 00:33:03.892, Speaker F: Yeah, thank you so much.
00:33:04.026 - 00:33:16.330, Speaker B: All right, awesome. We are now ready for our fifth finalist demo for today and that is Team Per Capita. So we'll get them here and quickly start with the fifth demo. Welcome everybody.
00:33:18.380 - 00:33:43.612, Speaker G: Hello. So let's get started. I'm Mege from per capita team. And we are from Bilkin blockchain society. So you can see who we are. And we have Utgu, Khan, Metahan and me in our team. So what we built for SuperHack we built per capita And Per Capita is a decentralized initial NFT offering platform utilizing proof of personhood and random distribution systems.
00:33:43.612 - 00:34:16.360, Speaker G: And we are using WorldCoin Hyperlain, Zora and Chainlink. So let's get started with the demo. And as you can see, this is our homepage. And you can see our tech stack here. Per Capita main contract lives in the Zora testnet. And let's actually launch an INO for Create as a collection owner. You can enter the name, description, the image, giveaway time and NFT contract address and the NFT price that the participants will have to stake to join the offering.
00:34:16.360 - 00:34:54.116, Speaker G: So we created a special collection for the Superek final. So let's create this and it takes some time to upload the image to the IPFS. Okay, so let's create our offering. Let's launch our offering in Zora testnet. And as you can see, we are directed to the INO page and you can see the details here. Okay, so as an owner, I can actually approve the spending of the NFTs and then add the NFDS here. And as an owner, I will actually join.
00:34:54.116 - 00:35:04.040, Speaker G: So in order to make sure that our offerings are resistant to cyber attacks, we are utilizing WorldCoin.
00:35:05.120 - 00:35:05.532, Speaker E: Okay?
00:35:05.586 - 00:35:41.798, Speaker G: So let's actually copy the QR code here and paste it here in a manual input and it will take some time. And then we will verify with the World ID. Okay, so let's verify with the World ID. It's verified, as you can see, and it will show that it's a correct proof. And we will also prove this on the Smart contract. So we know that WorldCoin is not supported in Zora. So we are utilizing the hyperlane here.
00:35:41.798 - 00:36:14.702, Speaker G: We are sending our proofs to a girly testnet. We are verifying it there and the response is coming back to us on the Zora testnet. And we are using layer One cross domain messaging here for the Op Stack functions. Okay, so you can actually see our active inos here. And let's see executable inos when the deadline is over. And as you can see, you can see what happens when the deadlines are over. So the collection status is executable.
00:36:14.702 - 00:36:43.334, Speaker G: And you can see the owner here. And three unique participants are here. And there are actually four NFDS. And if we execute this one, you can see that we will earn this amount of ether. And this is because we are incentivizing people to execute the offerings. And we are going to execute. And as you can see, we have the cross chain events here.
00:36:43.334 - 00:37:07.562, Speaker G: We are requesting chaining VRF to produce a random seed for us, but it is not again supported in Zora. So we are utilizing hyperlain again here. We are requesting it with the messaging API and it's coming back to us with the layer one cross domain messaging. Again, we will not wait for this. It takes about three minutes. And you can see the status here. It's actually pending random seat.
00:37:07.562 - 00:37:30.162, Speaker G: And let's see our last part. And it is past inos. You can see that we have a page here, it's NFT Nova. We have three unique participants here. And you can see that we have two NFTs here. So this address actually won an NFT. And this one, and you can actually come up here and claim this NFT.
00:37:30.162 - 00:38:00.718, Speaker G: But let's switch to another address. Okay, so this address did not win. So you can see that we can claim the deposit. And so there is no winner here. So, yes, so let's continue. And for our future work, we are planning to support initial coin offerings and distribution of airdrops. And our first focus will be deploying this on Zora mainnet and improve on it.
00:38:00.718 - 00:38:22.840, Speaker G: And when Op Stack chains can communicate natively, we will wait for the migration of key protocols chaining and WorldCoin into Optimism mainnet. And then we will be doing super chain messaging. And thank you for listening. And I would like to thank It Global and all the amazing partners. It was an amazing journey for us. Thank you.
00:38:25.370 - 00:38:25.686, Speaker A: Thank.
00:38:25.708 - 00:38:52.800, Speaker B: You so much for that demo and super interesting use case to kind of do these things cross chain and rely on different messaging to actually make this whole thing work. So definitely a much more fair way of thinking about any sort of participation. So congrats. Thank you. All right, finalist number five done. Let's get on to demo number six. Without further ado, let's welcome refer Marvin, whenever you're ready.
00:38:53.490 - 00:39:37.610, Speaker H: Hi, my name is Marvin with team refer. And like you all, our goal is to be part of crypto reaching the next billion and what's more mainstream than McDonald's. So today we're going to show you how McDonald's could have used refer to promote its NFT drop by getting fans to refer their friends who get rewarded in USDC. But first, we need to clarify two terms. We'll be using a lot, campaign NFT and reward token. In this case, the campaign NFT is the McRib NFT, the thing that the business wants the public to interact with. And USDC will be our reward token, meaning that if somebody refers a friend who then mints the McRib NFT, they'll both be rewarded in USDC.
00:39:37.610 - 00:41:42.990, Speaker H: So let's jump into the demo, and we're going to start out as a McDonald's marketing manager that wants to create a referral campaign. They'll start off by defining the campaign NFT and the reward NFT. And we'll use these two test tokens, and they also need to define some thresholds and some payout amounts that we'll just kind of breeze through. This is using our on chain contract factory to spin up a new contract just for this campaign. And now we need to approve the newly created campaign to distribute rewards on our behalf as the McDonald's marketing manager. Now the campaign is fully set up and superfans can start engaging. So we'll switch to the wallet of a superfan and they'll validate first their humanness with WorldCoin and they'll send that on chain for final registration.
00:41:54.910 - 00:41:55.274, Speaker B: Great.
00:41:55.312 - 00:43:48.760, Speaker H: Now the superfan is registered and they have a link that they can share with friends. And so to finish up, we'll switch to a wallet for the friend of the superfan, and they want to claim this referral. But when we were setting up the campaign, we said that in order to claim, you needed to have some McRib. And for the sake of time earlier today or yesterday, we went ahead and sent some McRib to this friend. So they should be able to also validate their humanness register and be rewarded and will ultimately expect payout to both the superfan and their friend. And sending that on chain, the referral was successfully claimed, and we can see that the friend just received some USDC as a reward and the superfan did as well 19 seconds ago. So that's it for the demo.
00:43:48.760 - 00:44:44.360, Speaker H: And to close out talking about work in progress from the back end perspective, we got some cross chain functionality working so that you could validate ownership of a token on one chain and pay out on another or perform world coin validation from a chain without native support. There is a tutorial on our website for how to do this. We also got started with account abstraction so that the refer and referee, the Superfan and the friend wouldn't have to pay for transactions leveraging Safe and Pimlico. And as next steps, we would want to double down on our Sybil detection through Bespoke KYC Social Graph and on chain activity detection, as well as integrating with Oracles and Attestations to detect loyalty beyond NFTs and possibly even off chain. Thanks a lot. It's been a lot of fun.
00:44:46.810 - 00:45:15.630, Speaker B: Thanks, Marvin. This was a really cool demo. I think it's hard to kind of condense all the things that you're trying to do in just a short amount of time. But the fact that you get to do this super creatively and manage referrals from both sides is, I think, just a very unique way to do that on chain. So this was super cool. And looking at the chat comments, everybody wants the Mac rib now, including myself. Thanks for that and congrats.
00:45:16.930 - 00:45:17.342, Speaker H: Thanks.
00:45:17.396 - 00:45:23.940, Speaker B: All right, four more devs to go, so let's bring on number seven, SuperSearch. Welcome.
00:45:25.670 - 00:46:11.540, Speaker A: Hi, Karthik. Welcome. Hi, everybody. So I'm presenting to you SuperSearch. So before we dive into what my hack is, I would like to propose a question that is, what would you do after a transaction? So, when I make a transaction in my favorite app, it takes me to these screens. So I might need to click on the link that is the view on the Explorer and it will take me to the Explorer. But this might not give a great user experience because I'll need to leave the DAP and as soon as I enter the Explorer, the explorers are quite technical and overwhelming and it might not be that much easy for a new user to understand it.
00:46:11.540 - 00:47:11.990, Speaker A: And user might also need to refresh the page multiple times if he wants to see the updates. And suppose if he's making a bridge transaction, then he might need to see multiple Explorers so as to see the status of different transactions. So in DApps perspective, do the DApps have any other choice? What if they do? So, we are introducing you SuperSearch, which is empowering DApps with the features of an Explorer. Now let's look at the short demo of this. So here I have actually cloned my uniswap interface, which is one of my favorite swaps. So I've also integrated SuperSearch, as you could see. And now I'll try to make a simple swap from matic to a stable coin.
00:47:11.990 - 00:48:22.720, Speaker A: So as you can see, it's loading, fetching me and I'll confirm the swap which will take me to MetaMask. And I'll make sure that I'm giving gas fee size so that my transaction goes fast. And as you can see, transaction is getting submitted and the transaction as was picked by the DAP and it's currently loading. Cool. So my transaction got success and you could see all the details, the status has been successful and you could also see state block related data from where it was sent from the value of the transaction and the transaction fee, cash fees et cetera. So if I also like to verify whether I have received my swap tokens I could just click on my address. So it is currently loading my address.
00:48:22.720 - 00:49:10.410, Speaker A: Now it will actually fetch me the balances and also the recent transactions. So super cool. So now I've received my swap token also. So apart from this what all features that are there? So there's a feature where you can search for addresses, you can search for transaction and also the ENS domain. Now I'll make search for a simple ENS domain, let's say John Doe e and I'll select it and it is as simple as such. So as you could see it also loaded. So integrating in your DApps is pretty much easy.
00:49:10.410 - 00:50:05.934, Speaker A: So now I'll just close it and now I will show you how easy it is to integrate DApps. So you could integrate all of it with just a single line of code, you just need to insert it inside the header part of your tab and you're good to go. So this is a text tag that we have used. We have used webpack for bunking, then super fast covalent APS for the data, fetching and react for dwarf and going ahead we have a lot of features that we want to build. Currently we are in an MVP stage. Then we want to improve the user experience for a normal user and we would like to also give a proper reason for why the transaction might have failed and other features like gas tracker, NFT, sticky data et cetera. And we would like to add faucets for test tags and educating a user on the technical terms is also quite important.
00:50:05.934 - 00:50:32.920, Speaker A: We'd like to go ahead with that and we would also like to update the searches builders information. So with that I wrap up my presentation. So if you guys would like to check the SuperSearch you could just scan the QR code. I would like to thank it global the judges and the sponsors for letting me present this event and it was super fun to work for this. Thank you.
00:50:36.330 - 00:51:09.186, Speaker B: Elton. That was a really amazing slick demo, just a super easy and well needed real world utility. So congrats on shipping that and I'm sure this is now just a few days away from being a norm where everybody wants to have this small widget there to let everybody see what's actually happening on Chain. Congrats and hopefully all of us get to use this in the yes, thanks for cutting. Awesome. Moving on to more devtool related demos, let's welcome on Chain review whenever you're.
00:51:09.208 - 00:51:45.600, Speaker C: Ready GM I'm don and here is our diverse team on chain review. We are from sitestream. It's a tech company in Germany. On Chain Review is the missing tool to review and to attest deploy smart contracts for op stack developers. And why did we build it? First and foremost is to solve our own pain points of reviewing contracts. But we believe this can also solve other people's problems as well. Then let me skip this and show you the demo of the tool.
00:51:45.600 - 00:53:05.830, Speaker C: So first you select the chain. Here you can see all the chains that we are supporting currently and I would click the Ethereum and then you can type in the contract address that you want to review. First thing you see is the source code of the contract and the same contract. If you scroll down a bit, you can see this here we identified all addresses of this contract and this includes the hard coded address in the contract and the address defected from Ethereum blockchain state. And also if you scroll down a bit more you can see the variables that hold the address. And if you click one of this you can also see the source code of the contract that is deployed on this address. And another important functionality of the tool is the ability to attest the contract.
00:53:05.830 - 00:54:30.920, Speaker C: Here you can click the test after you finish your review. The important part is that we are not only attesting the address of the contract but also the hash of the code. So this helps to make the review attestation more reliable. And now we change it the state and also show the revoke button. And the third functionality which related to the vivia attestation is the ability to follow other trusted attestors. For example, you can follow your coworkers or you can follow the non auditors testations as well as the followers are stored on chain for transparency. Once you follow the user, you can see their attestation on the top part as well.
00:54:30.920 - 00:55:21.946, Speaker C: And also you can go on your profile page and then follow your old actions and see who you are following and also the followers that you have. And this was our demo. Here's our future plan with this project. Our next goal is to build this into a fully fledged suit for on chain reviews of deployed contracts. And the further goal is to include Nova solutions to incentivize and align a higher number of independent contract reviews. If you have any query regarding our project, you can reach out to us using this email. And thank you all for your attention.
00:55:21.946 - 00:55:24.400, Speaker C: This was team on chain review.
00:55:28.050 - 00:55:47.030, Speaker B: Amazing. Thank you so much for that really cool demo and such an awesome collaborative way to actually do reviews and actually make sure things are performing as expected on chain, especially the number of weirdness we've seen with sneaky code in there. So this is great. Hopefully all of us get to use it and congrats.
00:55:47.610 - 00:55:48.920, Speaker C: Thank you very much.
00:55:49.610 - 00:55:59.050, Speaker B: All right, we got two more demos to go. So let's bring on our second, last finalist for today Stardust CCIP. David, whenever you're ready. Hello.
00:55:59.120 - 00:56:44.530, Speaker E: Yes, my name is David and I'm really interested in making blockchain games that you can play outside a browser and that you can play across multiple chains. So for this hackathon, I made Stardust, which is a space commerce game that uses chainlink CCIP to send secret cargo between blockchains. And I built it using Godot, which is an open source game engine, and I used Godot Rust and Ethers Rs to handle private keys. So let's launch the ship pretty quick here. It's going to take some time to get it between blockchains, but first I'll put some cargo in the cargo hold and then we'll go to optimism. So you see there's some lag here as the game waits for a response from an RPC node. And you also see that there's no MetaMask, there's no web wallet required because Ether's Rs can handle the signing of transactions.
00:56:44.530 - 00:57:33.414, Speaker E: So a game like this, in the future, people download just straight from a games marketplace or an app store. So majority of gameplay right now is just about shipping three different kinds of cargo between blockchains. So you have Anodyne, which is free and has a small reward. You have Tech, which has a modest cost and a modest reward, and you have contraband, which is probably the most interesting of the three, and that it's the most expensive and confers the highest reward. But it also carries the risk that other players can basically try and catch you if you carry it between blockchains. So the way this works is other players can see when ships are coming between blockchains. And so if they suspect a ship is carrying contraband, they can put up a certain amount of currency in the certain amount of collateral in the form of game currency, and put a claim on the ship and so that when it lands, there are certain consequences for that action, which I'll talk about later.
00:57:33.414 - 00:58:20.710, Speaker E: But I want to talk first about how this system maintains privacy and the secrecy of information. Because in the game, you just put in the values in the cargo hold. You choose your destination, you press launch, but the smart contract is public. It's on a public blockchain. So how do you prevent people from just seeing the fact that you carry contraband in your cargo hold? So the way this works is when the player picks values for their cargo, the game will pad those values with some zeros and it will concatenate them with assault that's generated by Godot. And then Godot will then hash that string to create a Shaw 256 hash and put that hash on chain into the pilot struct. So at this point, the hash is a secret that only you know, because only you know the values that were used to make that hash.
00:58:20.710 - 00:59:09.106, Speaker E: But Godot handles all this for you. So you don't have to worry about managing the hash yourself and constructing it properly. The game client has encoded to make sure you can't submit bad values. But the smart contract is there to make sure that people can't slip past the incorrect values. So anyway, once you've committed the hash to the pilot struct, it is sent cross chain through CCIP and when it arrives you need to sell your cargo before you continue playing the game and save to prove that your hash was made correctly. So to do this you can supply the salt supply the values that you had on chain, then on chain they're padded and then they are hashed and that hash is then compared with the hash you committed to the chain previously on the previous chain. So the hashes should match and if they do the smart contract then validates to make sure that the values you supplied were valid.
00:59:09.106 - 01:00:09.030, Speaker E: So it makes sure that for example, you didn't provide more cargo than your ship could actually hold and it also makes sure that you have the money to pay for the cargo that you just sent because you're charged retroactively for the cargo that you sent along. The reason why we do this is because if the amount that you spend was public, someone watching the contract could infer what you had just purchased. So we want to keep that information secret until the moment that you actually have to reveal your cargo. And as I mentioned, there is this system in place where if someone suspects you're carrying contraband now they can't know it because they just see your ship and they just see the hash and the cargo hold but say that you have a large ship and they think it's worth the risk of trying to catch you. Or if they see your shipping history and they're like okay, this person ships contraband pretty frequently so I'm going to try and catch them so they can offer up that collateral deposit and they can make a claim against your ship and let's say you were carrying contraband and they catch you. So instead of getting a reward for selling your contraband, you would actually lose your cargo. You lose all the money that you have spent on the cargo and the person who made the claim against you, they get a small bounty as a reward.
01:00:09.030 - 01:00:44.646, Speaker E: However, if you were clean and you weren't carrying contraband, you receive their collateral as an extra reward on top of your cargo. What do you get for selling your cargo? And of course if you are successful in carrying contraband across and nobody put a claim on your ship, you get a really big payout. That's the risk and the reward that comes from taking contraband and taking that risk that no one's going to put a claim on your ship. So we have arrived now in optimism. So let's sell our cargo real quick and once this transaction clears, we put a claim on our own ship. So we should get penalized for this. Instead of getting money, we should actually lose some.
01:00:44.646 - 01:00:53.580, Speaker E: And yes, unfortunately, because we put the claim around ship, contraband was detected. So, yes, that's the majority of the gameplay for Stardust. And thanks for watching.
01:00:57.550 - 01:01:03.926, Speaker B: That was a really cool game demo and just really impressive that you're able to do this thing in a week. Congratulations.
01:01:04.038 - 01:01:05.190, Speaker E: Thank you very much.
01:01:05.360 - 01:01:25.540, Speaker B: Can't wait for on Chain Eve online version of this. That'll be the ultimate dream. This is amazing. All right, well, thank you so much. And with that, we are ready for our 10th finalist demo for today. And without further ado, let's welcome our last finalist team Shortcuts. Whenever you're ready.
01:01:25.540 - 01:01:29.198, Speaker B: Right. Hello everyone. My name is Alex.
01:01:29.294 - 01:01:30.446, Speaker I: My name is Sergey.
01:01:30.558 - 01:02:02.698, Speaker B: And we want to share with you what we've built during ZTH Global Hug project. Name shortcuts. Well love smart contracts, whether as devs or users. Openness implies transparency, and building on existing foundations is easier. Challenge arise in discovering and verifying of new DApps. Also, they often come with a unique user experience, which may not always be convenient for newcomers with shortcuts. Our way of tackling these problems making it super easy to mix and match smart contract actions and helping you find new stuff effortlessly presented in a user friendly UI.
01:02:02.698 - 01:02:04.320, Speaker B: Let's move on to the demo.
01:02:05.250 - 01:02:36.198, Speaker I: Yes, we start by getting to Shortcuts app, and then the first shortcuts we will create is Bridging to base. What it does is we select the chain first and then amounts that will be variable and required for every launch of the shortcut. And then we add actions. Actions is different. Smart contract calls. And then you select the contract. We fetch the abi of this contract and then specific parameters.
01:02:36.198 - 01:03:19.478, Speaker I: You can also use inputs that you defined before. And this is the Bridging contract the base uses. And then we publish that we can add more actions to make a multi step. This transaction is posting the shortcut to Ethereum attestation service on Optimism. As soon as it clears, we see that it's based bridge. Here we use GraphQL to fetch that from Es and then we can go ahead and just run it so you remember that it's on Ethereum on L One, so we can switch chain. And this is something that I want to bridge, but before that, I want to simulate to see if it's really something that I expect to happen.
01:03:19.478 - 01:03:53.074, Speaker I: And we use tenderly and then it loads that it is indeed L One bridge. Some coins will be transferred, this amount that I set, so all good. Before that, I can also go ahead and inspect that. When I inspect that, I can see that it's indeed an es optimism. Posted by Me this is the chain used the name and then the IPFS ID. So you'll be able to go ahead on IPFS and check that the shortcut is legit and this is basically the shortcut definition, something like that. It's from a different one.
01:03:53.074 - 01:04:35.466, Speaker I: And if you find with that to save your time, next time, you can save it to BOOKMARKS for later. And then we can basically go ahead and execute and you see that it's a main net transaction. I'm going to send this amount of ETH to the bridge. I'm sending it, and while it happens, it may take some time. So what we'll do is we will explore what else is there. We prepared some other shortcuts, and one of them is actually on our GitHub, where all the code is posted for this project. And this is a donation shortcut, so you'll be able to send us some op on the mainnet.
01:04:35.466 - 01:04:59.334, Speaker I: So for that, we have two different actions. It's two different smart contract calls. And as we know that wallets are not great on calling multiple contracts. It's going to be two different transactions. We'd like to use safe for that. So we use safe and integrated natively, so you don't need wallet connect or anything like that. So you can just select whatever safe you control, and then you can propose transaction right away.
01:04:59.334 - 01:05:45.170, Speaker I: If you are one of the signers and I do the sign and then transaction proposed, I can go to my safe now, which is here. And then in the queue, you'll be able to see that transaction is indeed here. Just posted two different actions. One is just I approve spending op, and then I do the donation. With this amount of ope, you can actually go ahead and explore what's there and you see it one op. I will just execute this transaction. I sign it, and then it goes wild and runs it's the time that we go and check what happened to the bridge.
01:05:45.170 - 01:06:18.160, Speaker I: Well, most likely it did it. Yes, because the bookmark is saved as well. And you can go ahead and explore this bookmark. To rerun the shortcut, you can also share the link. This link is basically you can post it anywhere on Twitter, GitHub, or anywhere else. I think we covered more or less all of it. And then in order to try that yourself, you can just go ahead on shortcuts WTF and give it a run.
01:06:18.160 - 01:06:19.520, Speaker I: Thank you.
01:06:23.650 - 01:06:41.714, Speaker B: Alexander Sergey. It was such a cool hack. The fact that it's live and everybody can use and you also got that really nice domain name is amazing. I think the perfect mix of a dev tool, but also a utility for everybody else and a good service for everybody to kind of just quickly get started with a lot of these block actions.
01:06:41.842 - 01:06:42.594, Speaker A: This is great.
01:06:42.652 - 01:06:43.638, Speaker B: Congratulations.
01:06:43.814 - 01:06:44.700, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:06:46.110 - 01:07:29.926, Speaker B: Well, this concludes all ten of our finalist demos. And I want to quickly also congratulate these ten teams again. So a massive shout out to shatter, roll up ClickSafe, per capita starter, CCIP on chain review shortcuts, a testament, globe Grafter refer and superserves.

01:15:28.548 - 01:16:11.082, Speaker B: A quick announcement around the prize delivery. So everything that we talked about is a tentative and not a final announcement of prizes. Which means that over the next couple of weeks, we'll be verifying everybody's code bases, making sure that we have all the information that we need to know to fully make sure that these things are finalized, which is everybody ensuring that everybody worked on the projects after the hackathon started. All the team members are there. We don't have any commits from somebody who was not registered as a team. All those things will kind of happen over the next two weeks and our deadline to kind of do all of that and finalize everything is September 1, and after that is when all the prizes and your stakes and everything else will be released. And there are a couple of KYC requirements from some partners, so you may be in that category.
01:16:11.082 - 01:16:55.546, Speaker B: So if you fall into that category as a recipient, you'll be getting a note separately around some compliance related things that you'll have to satisfy before your prizes can be given to you. So keep all of that on the look in your inbox. All this will be communicated to you over email, and that's kind of the final note on the prize delivery. So this is very much closer to the end of SuperHack and want to make sure that before we wrap things up, we kind of say some thank yous and talk about what's coming up. So I want to give a massive shout out to everybody that made this event possible. Obviously, there's a lot of roles that work behind the scenes to do all these things, but I want to start off with all of you amazing hackers. More than 150 of you took the time to work on amazing projects for ten days, and you put your heart and soul into it.
01:16:55.546 - 01:17:35.346, Speaker B: You made something you were proud of, you showed everything to everybody else out there, and you shared everything with the world. So congratulations to all of you for taking the time and participating at this event. This means a lot to us. I want to thank all of our amazing judges for talking to everybody on a live call from 80 different countries, learning about what they were excited about, how they built something, and giving them feedback and advice on how to take them further. So congratulations and thank you to all of our judges, all the amazing mentors and volunteers that made things work in the background, ensuring that you have the best experience no matter which part of the world or what time or what time zone you were on. Thank you to all these mentors and volunteers who made this possible. Amazing set of speakers.
01:17:35.346 - 01:18:18.450, Speaker B: We did workshops, talks, and everything that you can now watch on demand to learn about what's happening in this space and really stay up to date on all the latest tech and research. I want to thank all of our speakers for all of that and the amazing set of partners who have been here to help make this event super successful from all points of views.

So before we wrap things up, want to make sure that we kind of clarify one small thing. Ten teams came here. We called them our finalists, and they demoed what they built, and we kind of said, these are the products we're super excited about. But if this is the first time you've ever been to an EAP Global event. You may not know this thing, but we don't structure these as competitions.
01:18:48.470 - 01:19:40.590, Speaker B: So effectively, when we say somebody's a finalist, they came in first. And at the end of the day for SuperHack, those ten teams are our first place winners. And in addition to anything else they may have won from our partners, they'll be receiving 500 USDC per team member on behalf of the Eve Global Team and want to thank them and congratulate them for being a finalist. And really show the appreciation for all the amazing work they've done and just made their thing that they're excited about something real and shared it with the rest of the world. But that's not all. On top of everything else, they could have won and have won, I want to give everybody here a lot more. So every team member will also be getting ten sepulia ETH from eGlobal to test out and do things in testnets and not do them live in prod.
01:19:40.590 - 01:20:37.422, Speaker B: Every team member will also be getting an ENS domains from our side, a free Pragma entry to any of the upcoming pragmas that Ethcopa is doing in person.
