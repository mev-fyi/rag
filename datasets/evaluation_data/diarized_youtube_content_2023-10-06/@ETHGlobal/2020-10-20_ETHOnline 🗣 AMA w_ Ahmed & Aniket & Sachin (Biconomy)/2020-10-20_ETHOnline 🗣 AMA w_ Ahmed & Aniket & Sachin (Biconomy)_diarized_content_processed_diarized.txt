00:00:09.770 - 00:00:11.150, Speaker A: Awkward pause.
00:00:11.730 - 00:00:32.080, Speaker B: Glad Carl got here on time. I almost sent out a search party. 15 minutes late to the last one. There we go. My relic of what once was keyword. This will be worth something someday.
00:00:32.900 - 00:00:33.820, Speaker A: Someday.
00:00:33.980 - 00:00:36.480, Speaker B: Someday it'll be a collector's item.
00:00:37.300 - 00:00:42.550, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, we're good.
00:00:46.200 - 00:01:17.324, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, let's get started then. Cool. So thanks again to everybody for attending the AMA with the Biconomy team. Here we have Ahmed, we have Anikit, and we have Sachin from the Biconomy side. We're going to chat all about sort of how things got kicked off the history a little bit, of course, what is Biconomy and the technology that it enables, and basically everything in between. So, looking forward to this conversation and, of course, a big thank you to the team.
00:01:17.324 - 00:01:39.030, Speaker B: This is the first time we've had the opportunity to work so closely with them, and we're really appreciative of the support. We can't do this thing without our sponsors and everyone kind of bearing the cost on behalf of the attendees. So, big thank you for doing so and for coming to the event for the first time. I know it's a big jump and we're really thankful to have you on board.
00:01:40.040 - 00:01:48.010, Speaker A: Absolutely. No, we were really enjoying it, actually. So, yeah, really pumped to be a part of it.
00:01:48.620 - 00:01:49.464, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:01:49.662 - 00:01:50.120, Speaker A: Cool.
00:01:50.190 - 00:02:17.024, Speaker B: So let's maybe start I start these sort of a little bit early on in the process of the history, if you will. Love to kind of get a sense of sort of what everybody was working on before Biconomy and what you're working on now. I'd love to kind of know a little bit of the origin story, if you will, how we got to creating this. And yeah, a little bit, I guess, before times before we talk about the current times, if that makes sense.
00:02:17.142 - 00:02:48.804, Speaker A: Yeah, no, of course. Absolutely. I'll sort of start off so me and Inikip knew each other for a couple of years. He managed to sort of manage to get to know Sachin, which he introduced me to around the beginning of 2018. I was actually working for a Dubai based VC back at the end of 2018. They're very traditional ecommerce tech. They've done sort of plus billion dollar exits and they were just interested in blockchain.
00:02:48.804 - 00:03:19.696, Speaker A: So I was helping them with investing in blockchain and Tokens. And it was really at the end of 2018, when I was working there, that's when Me, Sachin and Nika came together. We wanted to do something in the space and we thought, you know what, staking is cool. Why not run Staking as a service? We invested in Tezos. We like the idea of proof of stake. We thought, let's go with it and see how it goes. And so three months of sort of being a baker and running nodes, we sort of realized that, hey, wait a minute.
00:03:19.696 - 00:03:25.800, Speaker A: All right, we've secure the network, but what's next? Right? Where are these applications.
00:03:26.700 - 00:03:27.160, Speaker C: Okay.
00:03:27.230 - 00:04:03.510, Speaker A: And now there are some applications we saw, where is actual adoption? Where are the users? And so we really asked ourselves the question, okay, why are there no users? And what are the main inhibitors affecting mainstream adoption? And so we sort of did a research, we spoke to a couple of developers, a couple of applications out there, and sort of realized that, hey, wait a minute. User experience. Not many people are dressing. Hello.
00:04:04.440 - 00:04:10.980, Speaker B: I think you're coming back now. Yeah, just a little bit, I think, when you're talking about the user experience.
00:04:11.130 - 00:05:34.080, Speaker A: Yeah, yes, exactly. So user experience and developer experience were sort of two really big issues that we saw. And so we saw many companies really replicating lots of infrastructure in house that they didn't need to, most of which we saw were a concept called metatransactions, whereby in very simple layman terms, where the end users are subsidized in terms of gas fees, the developers pay gas fees on behalf of the end users. And so we saw that multiple companies were building out this infrastructure in house to basically enable more adoption for their applications. And we thought, hey, this is actually a really interesting concept, but one which is still not yet optimized being made to a really clear, compelling infrastructure service. And so for us, we thought, hey, wait a minute, how about we actually build this piece of infrastructure out and sort of just give away as an API SDK? And really, since then, we thought, okay, this no thing was cool, but we thought this was a really bigger opportunity because not many people really tackling it at that time. And we were just sort of, I'd say, really head on with our vision of really bringing mainstream adoption.
00:05:35.460 - 00:05:36.210, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:05:36.740 - 00:05:38.210, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool.
00:05:38.980 - 00:05:44.260, Speaker B: Awesome. Anything to add to maybe your stories, Anikit and Sachin?
00:05:44.760 - 00:06:15.244, Speaker D: Yeah, I can also probably start prior to back on what was happening. I think Ahmed already discussed. I and Amadi studied together back in China, so I did work for companies like Binance at early on stages, like when they were doing an ICO. Kind of interesting experience to see the growth happening over there, then moved back to India. And India was focusing mainly on the investment side of things, so helping out startups from India to actually can you guys hear me?
00:06:15.442 - 00:06:16.684, Speaker B: Yeah, I can hear you. Okay.
00:06:16.722 - 00:06:23.452, Speaker A: Yeah, Carl said he can't hear you very well. Maybe if you just want to speak up. Any cut?
00:06:23.586 - 00:07:07.068, Speaker D: Yeah, so, yeah, I came back to India 2018, and I'm helping many projects from India, like in terms of investments, in terms of doing some BD stuff. And this is where I and Amad always used to talk about things we want to do in the space, and met such an in one of the events in India. Our vision sort of aligned regarding things he wanted to do in the space and things I wanted to do. So as ahmed said back in 2018, late, we all got together and we started by economy. And definitely the mission was to sort of drive the main adoption because we were working with different protocols, different investing in different teams, but we were not seeing any sort of adoption happening. And this is how it got started. And we wanted to see all these applications and more users to come on board.
00:07:07.068 - 00:07:14.112, Speaker D: And that was basically the entire sort of mission of starting my economy gotcha cool.
00:07:14.166 - 00:07:21.856, Speaker B: And then Sachin, I'll give you the last word on this question. There's anything that was left out or omitted, happy to turn over to you.
00:07:22.038 - 00:07:57.708, Speaker C: Yeah, I come from a technical background. I did my engineering in computer science in 2012, and back then I worked in companies like Samsung and make my Trip. That's one of the unicorns of India. So it's funny, I think it was 2013, I was trying to mine bitcoin. I saw a video, a cool video on YouTube about this bitcoin, and I tried to mine bitcoin. I tried to ran a software on my PC, but of course nothing happened. And then I gave it up.
00:07:57.708 - 00:08:57.330, Speaker C: And then again in 2017, again, because this blockchain technology was coming up in the space and being a developer, I started looking at from a technology point of view, and that's when I realized the full potential of this technology and I decided to quit my full time working job. And then I was fully into the space, exploring the space from a technology point of view. And yeah, as Emma said back then, we started off with tezos mining. At that point in time, everyone was experimenting around with some solutions in this space, but no one was actually building a proper solution for these Web three developers. So that's when it strike to us that why not build a solution that other people can use? That's how we started.
00:09:00.820 - 00:09:41.456, Speaker B: I mean, maybe we'll dive into a little bit about Biconomy and what you guys are. You, I think, Ahmed, you mentioned sort of the early days thinking a lot about user experience and developer experience, as well as being kind of critical drivers. Here a big piece behind your tech is kind of the idea of meta transactions, which I know you touched on a little bit as well. I guess maybe first question would be sort of like, how do metatransactions play into the kind of user experience, developer experience world? And what are some basically great example use cases that you can turn to to otherwise improve the Web three experience?
00:09:41.558 - 00:11:08.170, Speaker A: Basically, yeah, absolutely. I think really the core concept around I always like to use this analogy of whenever you watch a Netflix video, netflix doesn't really charge you their AWS bill, do they? Right, so why do these decentralized applications charge at every point? Sort of a gas fee, cell. Yeah, they don't go to the DApps themselves, but they still go they they go to sort of the miners, which are basically sort of maintaining the DAP, as it were, right? And so whenever you look at traditional web two applications, it's very seamless, it's very easy to use, there are no sort of headaches when you do any sort of transaction or any sort of interaction, the most you'd see is, do you confirm this? And then it's a yes or no and then just gone right with your life. So we've seen, and there's been a lot of research that sort of goes in to show that the more steps you sort of put in, the more distracted your end user becomes. And they drop off, I think it was during the height of CryptoKitties MetaMask or 99% drop off rate, was.
00:11:12.720 - 00:11:13.036, Speaker D: To.
00:11:13.058 - 00:12:23.504, Speaker A: Show the complexities that new people have to deal with when it comes to onboard. And so really, the idea behind meta transactions we really see is that, okay, what we'll probably be seeing in the future is, all right, developers will be paying these gas fees on behalf of end users, but it might happen in a number of different ways. A, they subsidize it just outright, b, it might just be priced in already, so there might be a service that would potentially offer and it's just priced in into whatever the customers are paying for. Or it could be sponsored by an ad, right? So you could see sort of Domino's Pizza as a GIF popping out saying they've sort of sponsored your transaction fee. And so we really see that these are sort of three main ways as to how we see transaction fees being played out in the long run. And so why is this important? Again, because if your end users are using your application, you'd want them to basically just have a very seamless experience, very frictionless experience. You don't want them to sort of confirm or approve a smart contract and then sort of pay gas again.
00:12:23.504 - 00:13:18.950, Speaker A: You just want them to sort of sign once and that's it and you're sort of good to go. And great use cases are basically any interaction you would want your users to have with, so it's essentially any contract. So we've basically helped to power applications like Curve Finance, Idle Finance as well, and it's allowed users to deposit and use those products basically very easily and sort of free, right? They didn't have to pay gas, it's just sort of one click experience and they managed to basically use the application very easily. And so that's what we envisioned, sort of a very easy to use and robust transaction experience for end users. We haven't even gone into sort of dealing with pending transactions and stuck transactions, but I guess we could go into that a bit later.
00:13:19.320 - 00:14:20.904, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we'll probably touch some of that for sure. Maybe even with this question. My next question, I think one of the interesting things is, like you said, the beginning of kind of the relationship here was built around sort of baking on tezos and sort of proof of stake on tezos which obviously is not Ethereum, right? And I think kind of one of the interesting things as well is that by economy the tech is built in such a way that it is chain Agnostic, right? So obviously this is a service that can be helpful on any major blockchain who has the issue of needing to submit transactions and do so on behalf of other people and that kind of thing. So I guess kind of long way of saying, I guess what was sort of the interest in making sure that you were staying kind of so agnostic from everywhere else. And are there any kind of trade offs that you found that are associated with doing so rather than say, pairing one to one on the Ethereum network? I don't know who's that chance.
00:14:20.942 - 00:14:22.330, Speaker A: Do you want to go ahead on this?
00:14:25.260 - 00:15:49.588, Speaker C: So initially we started on Ethereum when we were building out the solution and at that point in time gas fees were not that much high. It was around one gigaweet gas price at that point in time. But when apps like CryptoKitties apps like those got involved in the system then we got to know about how an app could crash the whole blockchain. And with the increase in demand, users are at that point in time, like crypto, users are willing to pay highest gas fees just to get their transaction involved. So on Ethereum, this gas price subsidizing this gas price is not actually a practical solution given the gas prices went really crazy in the last two, three months when you saw this T Five Wave. But we believe in the long term the gas prices would go down and at that point in time some L2 solutions, there were some talks about these L2 coming up in the future where they will reduce the gas cost and they will increase the block creation, decrease the block creation time. So that's when we realized it's not just this level.
00:15:49.588 - 00:16:59.784, Speaker C: We have to think into the future and we have to be a blockchain Agnostic right from day one because it's not just about Ethereum and in the future it's going to be mix of various chains with their advantage, their specific advantage and you never know where the whole community moves towards in the future. Right now the biggest advantage of Ethereum is it has the composability. Right now everything is on Ethereum. But of course in the future I think L2 would be a great thing given the gas prices we see on layer one. That's when we decided, okay, let's build this infrastructure blockchain agnostic so that when it comes to the whole community moving to a particular L2 or any other solution, we would be ready there. Also, speaking of trade offs, I didn't see any trade off when we were building the system. It's just, you know, how modular, how scalable, you know, the your architecture should be in order to support these, you know, multi blockchain.
00:16:59.784 - 00:18:03.650, Speaker C: I think that was the only challenge. I would not call it a trade off. In that sense being blockchain Agnostic is actually good for us also and I don't see any trade off in security also because our system is trustless. Actually you don't have to trust with your transaction data to us because you sign the transaction data we can't tamper with any of your data and if we try to do it, the transaction would not pass on the blockchain. So in terms of security, I would not say any trade off but only thing right now is the Biconomy is semicralized so some would say you could censor the transactions. I think that's the only thing right now. But we are on the path of making it a decentralized solution tomorrow but not right from day one.
00:18:03.650 - 00:18:07.330, Speaker C: So I think we can talk a bit more about that.
00:18:09.300 - 00:19:03.170, Speaker D: Just adding to what Sachin said regarding the use cases and also different chains that we are supporting, as Amad mentioned before that wherever the transaction is, we see Biconomy playing A. So like from the day one we made sure that our system works with any other blockchain as well. So currently we are live on Ethereum, MATTech Xi and we compatible with any other EVM change. And the best part about Biconomy is like to integrate with any chain and this takes like few hours of integration only. So we made the integration with Binance smart chain within a day. So the plan ahead is to support as many as EPM chain as possible and have as many transactions as possible happening via and this is how we see the space evolving and how economy can be playing a part in not only Ethereum but any other blockchain out there.
00:19:05.160 - 00:19:26.200, Speaker B: Awesome. And I mean, since that in a way you're blockchain agnostic and are sort of sitting apart, is it currently possible or is it maybe in the kind of future plans to be able to kind of relay transactions between these different chains in sort of like a more interrupt type way? Like, could I then pay for an XDI transaction with Ethereum or vice versa?
00:19:26.540 - 00:20:27.308, Speaker D: So this is something we are very excited about actually this is part of the root bum as well and we are actually working on it to have interoperability transactions between different lay twos or different lay ones as well. So definitely I think that the way we are thinking about is firstly integrate with as many lay twos and lay ones as possible. So the easiest way possible to go to market strategy is to integrate more lay two S and EVM based chains. So as I already said, Exa and Matic is already integrated and we are looking at other lay two solutions as well. Talking of layer one, Tezos is something we're working closely with and we are planning to support Artic on Tezos as well in the next couple of months. So once we have transactions being delayed on all these blockchains, then definitely the next step ahead is how we can have interoperable transactions and how we can sort of interact the two layers together. So this is something really excited about and already we have a couple of plans on how we want to do things.
00:20:27.474 - 00:21:41.750, Speaker A: Yeah, just to add on to that, we are sort of, I would say, doing a part of that already where we're sort of like for example, we're supporting this application on L2 which is running on XDI. But what's interesting is that if you're basically a user on MetaMask, you don't need to change sort of the RPC or anything to the Xdai chain and so you could just really sign from Ethereum and basically the transactions happen in the background via. So that's pretty cool. I'd say that is, let's say, a current way of how we're trying to sort know play about in this interoperability game before we sort of go on to do, let's say from Xdai to other chains or from Ethereum to other chains as well. But we'll see we're also speaking to other you have the Binance smart chain as well, which have their own sort of relayer concept as well, which is really interesting. So this is a very sort of nascent space which we're sort of continuously exploring and retroactively a part of.
00:21:42.120 - 00:22:10.370, Speaker B: I love it. It's like a really cool I think the future space I think is just a very interesting space. It's kind of like the idea of in a way kind of weaving fabric together. I think you guys get to be the piece of string that brings it all together, which I think would be very interesting. Yeah, awesome. Cool. So I want to just note for everybody else in the chat that if you do have any questions, feel free to either raise your hand or ask them directly in the chat and we'll be sure to bring them up.
00:22:10.370 - 00:22:43.130, Speaker B: I guess thinking about the tech that you've created so far, I guess basically big question that I normally ask people is if you were kind of at this event hacking as a creator, as a hacker, what would you probably be building right now? Maybe thinking about sort of the technology that you've built and what it enables. What would sort of be some of the exciting use cases that you would want to try out, I guess on your own tech, if that makes sense.
00:22:45.100 - 00:24:01.920, Speaker A: Yeah, that's actually a really good question. I would say what's interesting is because the way we built our tech is that it could basically support any general transaction, whatever the use case. So we haven't really built it for a particular type of, let's say, use case. But I would mainly say that what would be really interesting are for use cases which are very, let's say, customer centric, end user focused, where we'd see, I mean, whatever the use case, whether it's an NFT use case, whether it's a DeFi use case specifically for end users, where there's just sort of a very clean UX around the actual use case of the application, I would say. So something that's very smooth and slick and sort of just doesn't really annoy the end user with extra complicated steps is something that we'd like to see and basically this is what we think is going to be the norm right in the next couple of years. I'm sure you guys have other ideas.
00:24:02.740 - 00:24:39.970, Speaker D: If you look at the current market situation, I would definitely want to work something on the gaming aspect because as for the current market situation and being an application, maybe on some L2, I think a tech works perfectly over there. And already we have seen many of our clients in the gaming industry using us and what sort of value by economy can add to the user experience after integration. So gaming application where they see frequent interactions of users on chain and to remove the friction point, definitely my economy plays a very important part so I would have definitely built something over there.
00:24:42.420 - 00:25:24.990, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm also more inclined to seeing more cool games that have really a slick user experience that is something we enable because prior to bicormy, if you're building a game for the end user, for normal gamer who doesn't know what exactly ether is, what exactly a gas is, you can't see any adoption for these games on the blockchain. But right now, if you have a very cool idea, you could really build it out on blockchain without worrying about these complexities. And that's what we abstract away from the end user. That's what our solution does.
00:25:26.240 - 00:26:06.490, Speaker B: Awesome. I think I'm in the same vein. I'm still waiting for the amazing Diablo MMO type clone game that works perfectly NFTs as kind of a first class citizen. It's coming but I haven't seen it yet but yeah, I think I'd be hacking on the same thing. Awesome. And then I guess we talked about sort of the interoperability piece of maybe being one of the future projects or things that overlap with Biconomy. Anything else that you can tell us that is like in the pipeline that you're thinking about or projects that you're actively working on? I guess basically weird way of saying what's next?
00:26:09.900 - 00:27:06.750, Speaker D: There's something we're working on actively and we will be rolling out in a couple of weeks from now is the forwarder contract. So what it enables is it enables the end users to pay fees and ERC 20 tokens. So this is another something cool and very exciting product feature that we are planning to roll out because of course, let's say you're holding lot of synthetics or compound and not having Ethers you would want to pay fees and synth or compound while using the platform. So this is something also we can enable and something we do see, like a lot of demand in the market. And I think the initial sort of primary test has been done and we are very excited to probably launch it in a couple of weeks to make sure the end users we provide more convenience to the end users to pay transaction fees. Not only Ethereum, but maybe in some stable coins and some ERC 20 tokens. So yeah, this is another exciting product feature that will be rolling out soon.
00:27:08.080 - 00:27:24.290, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, that sounds great for people who either don't have ETH, either on purpose or by accident. It's certainly very frustrating to get to your wallet and realize you can't do anything. So yeah, I could totally see that being a really valuable use case.
00:27:25.700 - 00:28:05.570, Speaker C: One more thing, it's good for these DApps who does not want to subsidize these gas costs for their end user. It's really a good use case for those also so that the burden is not on the DAP developer. Also end user gets to pay the gas fees but at the same time he doesn't have to accrue all the ether, all the gas specific to that particular blockchain so everyone is happy. DAP developer don't have to subsidize the fees from his pocket and end user also gets to use the app by just paying in the token the user have.
00:28:06.980 - 00:28:27.370, Speaker B: Awesome. And then of course I can see this being even more powerful when paired with the feature of being able to have interrupts between different chains and that kind of thing. Of course it just kind of like end times ends the search space of things you can do basically. Yeah, that's really cool. Awesome. Great. Well, let's see if there's any audience questions.
00:28:27.370 - 00:28:36.410, Speaker B: There is one but I'm not sure if you're interested. I'm not sure if it's totally related to your project or not so maybe we can skip that one.
00:28:37.980 - 00:28:39.928, Speaker A: That is a billion dollar question.
00:28:40.094 - 00:28:41.770, Speaker B: It is a billion dollar question.
00:28:44.880 - 00:29:11.524, Speaker A: Companies working on this and many different answers to this. Actually it's funny because my first because I first started as a researcher in Blockchain see and hello? Yeah, you're back. Yeah, I'm back. I think I'm back now.
00:29:11.562 - 00:29:12.150, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:14.120 - 00:29:46.110, Speaker A: I was saying in 2016 was sort of when I got into the space and the first research topic I took up was actually identity and that has pretty much sort of I'd say at least it's pretty much evolved over these couple of years. You've got even newer companies, different people thinking about many different things in identity and to be honest, do you really need blockchain for identity is also a separate question. So there are more questions than answers when it comes to this.
00:29:47.200 - 00:30:02.868, Speaker B: Yeah, that's definitely a big topic which I think is outside of the scope of what you guys are working on. But yeah, like you said, there's a lot of people that are working on that problem right now, and there's like huge consortiums even, that are trying to tackle it. So it is literally a billion dollar question.
00:30:03.034 - 00:30:07.850, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's going to happen. It's definitely going to happen. Totally. We don't know when.
00:30:08.540 - 00:30:44.450, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, well, it looks like maybe we'll wrap up here. Thank you so much for taking the time, all three of you, to chat with us. Really. Again, thank you for taking part in the event, both here and both sponsoring as Biconomy, of course, for anyone who's looking to build with UX as a central pillar of your tech or really in kind of any way to make your app not a web3 app in Usability. Take a look at what they're building and take a look at using Biconomy in your hack. Of course, if it's a user facing thing, then you really owe it to your users to take a look.
