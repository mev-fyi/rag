00:00:06.170 - 00:00:17.040, Speaker A: Okay, up next we have Mark Dawson from Quicks, who is going to talk to us next. Hey, Mark, thanks for joining us.
00:00:17.570 - 00:00:19.440, Speaker B: Hey, Katie, great to be here.
00:00:20.370 - 00:00:26.760, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for being here. For sure. All right, I will hand it over to you. You can go ahead and get started.
00:00:27.770 - 00:00:28.774, Speaker C: Okay, great.
00:00:28.892 - 00:00:37.734, Speaker B: I will go ahead and do a screen share. Okay, great. Can you see that Katie going?
00:00:37.772 - 00:00:40.178, Speaker C: Okay, awesome.
00:00:40.284 - 00:00:41.660, Speaker A: We're good to go. Thanks.
00:00:42.270 - 00:00:48.250, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Hey, everybody. My name is Mark Dawson and I'm the co founder of Quicks.
00:00:49.870 - 00:00:51.226, Speaker C: And I'm going to talk about the.
00:00:51.248 - 00:00:53.162, Speaker B: Optimism NFT ecosystem today.
00:00:53.216 - 00:00:55.006, Speaker C: So that'll be a little bit of.
00:00:55.028 - 00:00:59.934, Speaker B: A change of pace from some of the more technical talks. This one will be a little more.
00:00:59.972 - 00:01:02.830, Speaker C: Fun and a little bit less technical.
00:01:04.630 - 00:01:31.420, Speaker B: So let me tell you a little bit about Quicks. We're the largest NFT marketplace on optimism. We're top five delegate in the Optimism NFT governance system. So you might have heard about the Token House and the Citizens House. We're top five delegate in the Token House, so we'll be voting on proposals for the governance fund.
00:01:32.110 - 00:01:35.686, Speaker C: If you're trading on Quicks, the average.
00:01:35.718 - 00:01:53.582, Speaker B: Gas fee is $0.14 compared to Openc or like ETH Mainnet, which will be today usually about 2-3-A few months ago, you might remember it was close to like $50. So we're probably ten x or 20.
00:01:53.636 - 00:01:57.634, Speaker C: X 30 x cheaper than Ethereum Main.
00:01:57.672 - 00:02:31.286, Speaker B: Net, and we've traded about 2500 ethan volume so far. We launched Quicks in December 2021, right around the time that optimism removed its whitelist for apps. So if you're an NFT creator, you probably have used one Ethereum, maybe Salana, maybe Polygon. The Optimism NFT ecosystem is much smaller today than the other ecosystems, but it's very exciting for a few reasons. So why would you be excited to use layer two NFTs? Layer twos are, of course, like faster.
00:02:31.318 - 00:02:36.286, Speaker C: And cheaper, and that sounds great, but.
00:02:36.308 - 00:02:41.838, Speaker B: It'S actually even more exciting because it's like ten x faster, maybe 100 x cheaper. So it means that you're going to.
00:02:41.844 - 00:02:44.478, Speaker C: Be doing totally different things.
00:02:44.644 - 00:03:17.434, Speaker B: The way I like to say it is that layer one, Ethereum is like you're driving a car. And layer two, optimism, means that you're going to be flying in a plane, so you're going to be taking trips that you didn't take before. So what kind of trips might those be? So the breakout use cases that I'll highlight so far creator own Smart Contracts mirror XYZ is one of the biggest web3 blogging platforms out there. And historically, they had one big smart contract on Ethereum Main net so that.
00:03:17.472 - 00:03:18.060, Speaker C: People.
00:03:20.690 - 00:03:24.478, Speaker B: Didn'T have to deploy a smart contract for every new blog post that.
00:03:24.484 - 00:03:27.818, Speaker C: They made that saves on gas.
00:03:27.914 - 00:03:51.298, Speaker B: But the problem is that your writing NFTs can be mixed with other people's blog posts, which creates kind of a confusing experience on OpenSea or Marketplace, and it can just make your work harder to find. So earlier this year, Mirror moved over to optimism. And now when you're creating a blog.
00:03:51.314 - 00:03:57.970, Speaker C: Post on Mirror, you can deploy your blog post as its own contract.
00:03:58.050 - 00:04:01.866, Speaker B: On optimism, it's going to cost only maybe like $5 compared to maybe like.
00:04:01.888 - 00:04:03.740, Speaker C: Fifty dollars to one hundred dollars on Main Net.
00:04:04.110 - 00:04:33.106, Speaker B: And on our marketplace you can trade the writing NFTs and they're all their own distinct collections and like on Ether scan they're all going to be their own contracts. So that's pretty exciting and pretty creator friendly. Another cool use case of layer two is reputation NFTs. So just about a month ago, Rabbit Hole, which is a big Web three education platform, launched some badges on our.
00:04:33.128 - 00:04:37.934, Speaker C: Platform so you can collect these NFTs.
00:04:37.982 - 00:04:56.518, Speaker B: To prove that maybe you learned a new skill set or that you completed some task. So maybe you learned about some DeFi protocol and now you want a reputation NFT. That doesn't really make that much sense to do on Ethereum Main net because you're probably not going to make a lot of money off of the badge NFT.
00:04:56.694 - 00:04:59.626, Speaker C: And so you don't want to be.
00:04:59.648 - 00:05:24.098, Speaker B: Paying like $5 to mint it. But on Optimism, you can mint it for like ten cents. And what's really exciting for me is these reputation NFTs today, they're mostly about collecting, but eventually they could be about unlocking maybe some special skill set. I think all these like if we put more things on chain, like if we give you more badges for all.
00:05:24.104 - 00:05:31.654, Speaker C: The stuff you're doing, that gives developers a richer set of data to build on top of.
00:05:31.692 - 00:05:35.926, Speaker B: So my hope is that if I've done a lot of DeFi activities, maybe when I visit a web3 site.
00:05:36.028 - 00:05:38.534, Speaker C: It'Ll kind of recommend to me D.
00:05:38.572 - 00:05:50.830, Speaker B: Five activities or something like that. So reputation NFTs are a great use case of layer two composable NFTs are another one that means NFTs that combine with each other. So Dope Wars is an NFT project.
00:05:50.900 - 00:05:54.400, Speaker C: That was released actually like.
00:05:56.290 - 00:05:57.854, Speaker B: Mid to late 2021.
00:05:57.892 - 00:06:03.042, Speaker C: So they were really early on it. They began on Ethereum and they wanted.
00:06:03.096 - 00:06:10.014, Speaker B: To have these characters that they could equip items to. So they have these characters called Hustlers.
00:06:10.062 - 00:06:12.610, Speaker C: And you want to give them some.
00:06:12.680 - 00:06:26.214, Speaker B: Sneakers and the sneakers are NFTs and the Hustler is an NFT and you want to combine them. The problem on Ethereum Main Net, once again, is that you're going to be looking at like a $5 gas fee for doing that.
00:06:26.332 - 00:06:30.294, Speaker C: And really as L One Ethereum gets.
00:06:30.332 - 00:06:39.146, Speaker B: More expensive, the only things that you're going to want to be doing on L One Ethereum are things that have direct financial benefits. So maybe you'll trade on L One Ethereum, but you're probably not going to.
00:06:39.168 - 00:06:41.786, Speaker C: Want to equip or interact with your.
00:06:41.808 - 00:06:42.810, Speaker B: NFTs.
00:06:45.470 - 00:06:46.602, Speaker C: On L One Ethereum.
00:06:46.666 - 00:06:52.950, Speaker B: So they built their own bridge, actually, which is pretty cool, and bridged their collection to optimism.
00:06:53.130 - 00:06:55.982, Speaker C: And that's just the beginning.
00:06:56.046 - 00:07:02.494, Speaker B: There's a lot more I'll say about Composable NFTs later. Another great use case is Dragonia.
00:07:02.542 - 00:07:05.346, Speaker C: They're an on chain gaming platform, I.
00:07:05.368 - 00:07:22.250, Speaker B: Think one of the first on chain games on optimism. So with these you buy these Dragon trainer NFTs and they can battle each other and it's like a little bit like Pokemon but much more simple. What's cool is that the battle interactions happen on chain.
00:07:23.310 - 00:07:25.754, Speaker C: Once again, as you're putting more stuff.
00:07:25.792 - 00:07:33.562, Speaker B: On chain and doing slightly less financial activity on chain. You can't be doing that on Ethereum Mainnet because it'll be too expensive.
00:07:33.626 - 00:07:37.630, Speaker C: So you're going to want a layer two like optimism.
00:07:38.370 - 00:08:17.606, Speaker B: These are all live projects today and there's a bunch that I didn't get to talk about. So let me go ahead and focus on the ecosystem. We have about 40,000 people trading today on optimism. 40,000 unique wallets, I should say, and a lot of those are in Thailand and East Asia, which is pretty cool. Many are pre existing NFT communities. So Crypto Testers, which is this guy with the Opie hat and he's green. The crypto testers is a community that's.
00:08:17.638 - 00:08:20.246, Speaker C: Existed for a couple of years and.
00:08:20.368 - 00:08:51.686, Speaker B: Their goal is to test out new crypto protocols. They issued their community membership NFTs on optimism, which we were really excited about. And those are trading on quits today. The other NFTs I'll point out here, a lot of them are pure art NFTs. So this top one is called Aptimism. That's from our community in Thailand. They have a very active community and some really strong developers over there.
00:08:51.686 - 00:08:57.830, Speaker B: A lot of them will review smart contracts that we put out and they've created their own launch pad.
00:08:58.330 - 00:09:02.266, Speaker C: This middle one that looks like you.
00:09:02.288 - 00:09:32.354, Speaker B: Can'T quite tell what it is, that's called Ganland and that's AI generated art by a project called Fractal Visions and that's based in Colorado, I believe, in the United States. We have town in the top right. This is like the animal looking ghost and that is a collection again from creators in Thailand. That one's really fun. The Bortown Animal Ghost Project has the honor, I think, of being the first.
00:09:32.392 - 00:09:38.226, Speaker C: Collection that was copied by a scammer.
00:09:38.258 - 00:09:39.234, Speaker B: And put on OpenSea.
00:09:39.282 - 00:09:44.006, Speaker C: So like a scammer copied all the.
00:09:44.028 - 00:09:47.320, Speaker B: Art and launched their collection on Ethereum Main net.
00:09:48.190 - 00:09:51.338, Speaker C: And I always take that as a.
00:09:51.344 - 00:09:57.942, Speaker B: Sign that you're doing something right when people want to copy your work and take it to other places.
00:09:58.086 - 00:10:00.934, Speaker C: Because early, when you're establishing an ecosystem.
00:10:00.982 - 00:10:06.414, Speaker B: Of course the first thing that's going to happen is people are going to sort of copy what happens on layer one. Ethereum and tried an optimism, but now.
00:10:06.452 - 00:10:09.866, Speaker C: People are copying what's happening on optimism.
00:10:09.898 - 00:10:14.638, Speaker B: And trying to put it on layer one. So that's pretty cool. This one of the person in the.
00:10:14.644 - 00:10:16.994, Speaker C: Helmet is called Motorheads and that is.
00:10:17.032 - 00:10:25.742, Speaker B: A collection by a designer actually at Op Labs named Jvmi. And this collection is kind of about video games and early 2000s nostalgia.
00:10:25.806 - 00:10:29.894, Speaker C: So there is this really cool Mint page that had a Game Boy on it.
00:10:30.092 - 00:10:44.698, Speaker B: And that one's a pure art project that's quickly developing its own community. And then this one that's kind of cut off a little bit. This is a duck called Usagi Duck and that's from an artist in Japan. And she made this collection of 2000.
00:10:44.864 - 00:10:47.930, Speaker C: Ducks that all look very funny and whimsical.
00:10:48.670 - 00:10:50.366, Speaker B: So this is a taste of some.
00:10:50.388 - 00:10:54.266, Speaker C: Of the communities and artwork on Quicks.
00:10:54.298 - 00:11:02.506, Speaker B: Today that I wanted to give a shout out to. And another cool thing is that many.
00:11:02.548 - 00:11:09.906, Speaker C: Of these communities launched using our Launchpad on Quicks. So I'll take a minute to talk about that.
00:11:10.008 - 00:11:14.046, Speaker B: Our Launchpad is a creator owned smart.
00:11:14.078 - 00:11:14.770, Speaker C: Contract.
00:11:16.550 - 00:11:20.166, Speaker B: Tool that you can use to deploy your collection and will also create.
00:11:20.188 - 00:11:21.686, Speaker C: A Mint page for you.
00:11:21.868 - 00:11:41.658, Speaker B: And you can have your own Allow list and you can also reserve some for your core team and do the drop directly on our website. If you're a little more sophisticated, you can of course make your own smart contracts and make your own Mint page.
00:11:41.824 - 00:11:44.846, Speaker C: And we'll also index and pull those.
00:11:44.868 - 00:11:57.294, Speaker B: Collections into the marketplace. So we're just a big secondary marketplace and we're going to pull all the NFTs to pull out an optimism into our marketplace. So out of these ones, Ganland Motorheads.
00:11:57.342 - 00:12:05.186, Speaker C: Boardtown and Usagi Duck all used our Launch pad and Aptimism created their own.
00:12:05.288 - 00:12:10.654, Speaker B: Website and I think Crypto Testers did as well. And Aptimism also created their own launch.
00:12:10.702 - 00:12:13.814, Speaker C: Pad, I think, which is pretty cool.
00:12:13.852 - 00:12:30.974, Speaker B: There's also a bunch of other launchpad tools and creator tools on optimism. So you can find them at Nifty Kit and Mintflex. And there might be another one. But yeah, more and more creator tools coming to optimism. I'll say it's still a very tightly knit and community.
00:12:31.092 - 00:12:34.094, Speaker C: So a lot of these collections will.
00:12:34.132 - 00:12:49.330, Speaker B: Work with each other. So like, the Motorheads will often cross promote with the board tone NFTs for example. So you might be asking what's next for optimism NFTs?
00:12:50.230 - 00:12:54.302, Speaker C: Because so far the ecosystem is collections.
00:12:54.366 - 00:13:13.994, Speaker B: That you might see on mainnet. So like the art ones, the Tradable community pieces, we expect that to continue to grow. But we have these really exciting things in the pipeline. So we have an NFT bridge coming up that allows you to take an NFT on layer one ethereum and bridge it over to optimism. I'm going to discuss that more at.
00:13:14.032 - 00:13:15.740, Speaker C: Length in a couple of minutes.
00:13:16.270 - 00:13:25.166, Speaker B: We're excited about these reputation NFTs, so that's something similar to what rabbit hole is doing. Sometimes we call them badges. The difference here is that these are.
00:13:25.188 - 00:13:30.394, Speaker C: Often earned rather than purchased.
00:13:30.522 - 00:14:13.758, Speaker B: And they're often not really good assets for trading because they mean that you did something right. So like, if you completed a quest on rabbit hole, there's no reason for me to purchase that. But it's still really interesting and I'll talk a bit more about reputation NFTs and then compose one of these. So that's what I was talking about with dope wars. There's a developer named Austin Griffith. He has a pretty big following on Twitter, so you might have heard of him. And he has proposed this ERC called ERC Four Eight Three, which is a specification for composable NFTs that can fit together.
00:14:13.758 - 00:14:28.674, Speaker B: He created a collection on optimism called Optimistic lubies, where you can have these little characters and you can equip items to them like bow ties or lipstick, and there's a specification for doing that. So we're excited to help people make.
00:14:28.712 - 00:14:31.554, Speaker C: Composable NFTs and we think that's really.
00:14:31.672 - 00:14:34.034, Speaker B: Something special that you're going to want to do on a layer two rather.
00:14:34.072 - 00:14:35.750, Speaker C: Than on main net ethereum.
00:14:36.410 - 00:14:38.406, Speaker B: So let me talk a bit about.
00:14:38.508 - 00:14:42.326, Speaker C: The NFT bridge that is slated for.
00:14:42.348 - 00:14:44.070, Speaker B: Launch in October 2022.
00:14:44.140 - 00:14:46.120, Speaker C: So that's very soon.
00:14:48.510 - 00:14:58.858, Speaker B: Development was led by a software engineer named Sam Goldman on the Quicks team, and he has contributed that to the.
00:14:58.864 - 00:15:02.414, Speaker C: Optimism code base, so that will be.
00:15:02.452 - 00:15:11.614, Speaker B: Maintained by Op Labs. When we were designing it, our goals were first and foremost to be credibly neutral, so, like, no fees or anything.
00:15:11.652 - 00:15:23.806, Speaker C: Like that, and then fast, easy and permissionless. We want the structure and semantics of the bridge and especially of the corresponding.
00:15:23.838 - 00:15:30.466, Speaker B: Smart contracts, to be very close to layer one. And I think you'll find that that's a theme of a lot of projects on optimism.
00:15:30.658 - 00:15:34.214, Speaker C: Because of the EVM equivalents, it makes.
00:15:34.252 - 00:15:43.162, Speaker B: It easy to be very similar to layer one smart contracts and projects. And we want all the tooling around.
00:15:43.216 - 00:15:47.274, Speaker C: NFTs that you have on layer one.
00:15:47.312 - 00:15:57.886, Speaker B: To also work great on layer two. So that means, for example, that every layer one collection that is a smart contract is going to have a mirrored smart contract on optimism. We're not going to try and make.
00:15:57.988 - 00:16:05.342, Speaker C: For example, one giant contract and deploy everything on that one contract.
00:16:05.406 - 00:16:09.294, Speaker B: And the reason for that is that a contract for NFTs is often synonymous.
00:16:09.342 - 00:16:11.698, Speaker C: With a collection and we want to.
00:16:11.704 - 00:16:19.880, Speaker B: Keep that boundary there. We're using the official optimism cross domain messenger, and what that means is that.
00:16:21.130 - 00:16:26.086, Speaker C: We'Re using the official optimism protocol to.
00:16:26.108 - 00:16:40.318, Speaker B: Handle cross layer communication. This is different than using an Oracle or a service like layer zero. Layer Zero labs created these fun omnichan NFTs earlier this year, starting with the.
00:16:40.324 - 00:16:45.360, Speaker C: Ghostly Ghost collection, and that was really fun. But.
00:16:47.730 - 00:16:55.570, Speaker B: They did use a Web two style oracle to handle the message passing, which is cool because you can send.
00:16:55.640 - 00:16:56.690, Speaker C: NFTs.
00:17:00.790 - 00:17:04.526, Speaker B: In minutes, but you might have security concerns.
00:17:04.558 - 00:17:09.346, Speaker C: So this is a highly secure bridge. The trade off there is that it.
00:17:09.368 - 00:17:24.454, Speaker B: Might be a little bit slower than using an Oracle. So if you're going from layer one to layer two, it's going to be about 15 minutes. I think after the Bedrock upgrade for optimism. It's going to be more like five minutes to go from layer two to layer one. It's going to take a week because it has to go through the challenge.
00:17:24.502 - 00:17:26.170, Speaker C: Period for the fault proofs.
00:17:26.590 - 00:17:35.838, Speaker B: So for this bridge, it's like highly secure and therefore a little bit slower. In the future, there might be a.
00:17:35.844 - 00:17:39.982, Speaker C: Fast bridge that uses an oracle like layer zero.
00:17:40.036 - 00:17:41.294, Speaker B: But for this bridge, for the very.
00:17:41.332 - 00:17:43.934, Speaker C: First bridge in the optimism NFT ecosystem.
00:17:43.982 - 00:17:46.050, Speaker B: And one of the first official bridges.
00:17:49.430 - 00:17:51.038, Speaker C: For one of the first official bridges.
00:17:51.134 - 00:17:55.010, Speaker B: In the layer two NFT world, generally.
00:17:56.410 - 00:17:59.426, Speaker C: We wanted it to be as secure.
00:17:59.458 - 00:18:09.526, Speaker B: As possible and then I'll just briefly discuss how it works a little bit. So it's an escrow system, so it.
00:18:09.548 - 00:18:14.554, Speaker C: Just locks your layer one NFT in a layer one smart contract and then.
00:18:14.592 - 00:18:32.378, Speaker B: Sends the message to layer two, and then mints a corresponding NFT on layer two. And then that NFT can be passed around, it can be traded around. And then whenever you want to leave optimism, you can burn that NFT and it will unlock the layer one asset and give it back to you.
00:18:32.484 - 00:18:40.238, Speaker C: So this is how ERC 20 bridges work often, and it's how the optimism.
00:18:40.334 - 00:18:45.846, Speaker B: ERC 20 bridge works. And this means that the asset is just as valuable on optimism as it.
00:18:45.868 - 00:18:50.774, Speaker C: Is on layer one, because owning the.
00:18:50.972 - 00:18:53.366, Speaker B: NFT on optimism means that you own.
00:18:53.468 - 00:18:55.080, Speaker C: The asset on layer one.
00:18:56.250 - 00:19:05.222, Speaker B: So that is a deep dive on the NFT bridge. I wanted to talk about how we plan to use the bridge in our marketplace.
00:19:05.366 - 00:19:12.814, Speaker C: So Bridging, there's a technical aspect to Bridging, which is what I talked about.
00:19:12.852 - 00:19:29.554, Speaker B: With the message passing and with the smart contracts. But what might be even more interesting is the social aspects to Bridging. So NFTs are a little bit different from ERC 20 tokens because they often.
00:19:29.592 - 00:19:35.666, Speaker C: Have artwork and a community associated with it. And the community is kind of all.
00:19:35.688 - 00:19:37.758, Speaker B: You have in a lot of cases.
00:19:37.934 - 00:19:40.854, Speaker C: And so it's going to be the.
00:19:40.892 - 00:19:54.646, Speaker B: NFT owners at the end of the day that have to decide to bridge to optimism to take advantage of the cheaper fees and new design possibilities. With the lower fees and faster transaction times. It's unlikely, for example, that the core.
00:19:54.678 - 00:20:04.878, Speaker C: Developers of a project can just tell everyone to bridge. And so for that reason, we want.
00:20:04.884 - 00:20:10.606, Speaker B: To make it really easy for owners to bridge to optimism and also we want to make it easy for them.
00:20:10.628 - 00:20:12.682, Speaker C: To list across layers.
00:20:12.746 - 00:20:14.530, Speaker B: So this was like the Bortom project.
00:20:14.680 - 00:20:18.466, Speaker C: And this is how a collection is.
00:20:18.488 - 00:20:24.130, Speaker B: Laid out on Quicks. Today you're going to see a bunch of the assets in a grid format.
00:20:24.550 - 00:20:26.006, Speaker C: And I just put this here to.
00:20:26.028 - 00:20:42.380, Speaker B: Show you what a unified collection looks like. And for layer one collections, we want them to still be unified, even if they're partly bridged. So someone might point out, for example.
00:20:43.390 - 00:20:50.526, Speaker C: That there is a polygon NFT bridge and that OpenSea currently supports ethereum and.
00:20:50.548 - 00:20:56.526, Speaker B: Polygon and polygon is much cheaper. So why isn't everyone just bridging their.
00:20:56.708 - 00:21:07.778, Speaker C: Ethereum NFTs to polygon and trading them on OpenSea, since there's technically support for that? And the answer is that the platform.
00:21:07.864 - 00:21:13.746, Speaker B: Is not designed to encourage bridging because once you bridge, let's say you have a board ape, if you bridge the.
00:21:13.768 - 00:21:16.098, Speaker C: Board ape to polygon, that's going to.
00:21:16.104 - 00:21:27.990, Speaker B: Show up as a completely different collection on OpenSea. And people might think it's a scam, it's going to be weird. All the activity is going to be segregated between the two collections.
00:21:32.190 - 00:21:33.338, Speaker C: You're probably not going to be able.
00:21:33.344 - 00:21:50.910, Speaker B: To get as high of a price for that reason, because people might think it's less credible. And so the way we're designing Quicks is we want it to be designed so that you bridge NFTs. So we're soon going to begin indexing and showing layer one NFTs in your profile in Quicks.
00:21:51.330 - 00:21:54.686, Speaker C: And we're doing that not because we're.
00:21:54.718 - 00:22:11.846, Speaker B: About to also have trading happen on layer one because we were an optimism NFT marketplace, but it's so that you can have the opportunity to bridge your L one assets and beginning trading them on optimism. So if you have a board ape, for example, on Quicks, what you'll be.
00:22:11.868 - 00:22:20.714, Speaker C: Able to do is let's say you list your board ape on Quicks, then you'll be able to see the board.
00:22:20.752 - 00:22:23.254, Speaker B: Ape and its attributes and its rarities.
00:22:23.302 - 00:22:25.898, Speaker C: And its activity in the same place.
00:22:25.984 - 00:22:30.334, Speaker B: As all the layer one NFTs. So there's still going to be 10,000.
00:22:30.372 - 00:22:33.566, Speaker C: Items in the collection if that's how.
00:22:33.588 - 00:22:37.038, Speaker B: Many are on layer one. And it'll show maybe like 100 of.
00:22:37.044 - 00:22:47.058, Speaker C: Them have been bridged and are for sale. But we'll still do our best to pull in all the activity and all.
00:22:47.064 - 00:22:51.698, Speaker B: The context from layer one that you want to see. And this is really important because when.
00:22:51.704 - 00:22:55.720, Speaker C: You'Re trading NFTs, getting context and.
00:22:57.690 - 00:23:06.182, Speaker B: Feeling like you're a part of the bigger community is really important. So that is kind of how at the social layer, we're encouraging people to.
00:23:06.236 - 00:23:09.470, Speaker C: List their NFTs on optimism to bridge.
00:23:09.490 - 00:23:14.938, Speaker B: To optimism and to use them on optimism. And if we do this correctly, then this is just going to be a.
00:23:14.944 - 00:23:19.242, Speaker C: Pure win for everyone because the lower.
00:23:19.296 - 00:23:21.694, Speaker B: Fees on optimism mean that you can.
00:23:21.732 - 00:23:24.618, Speaker C: Have lower price collections.
00:23:24.714 - 00:23:29.662, Speaker B: So on Ethereum today, if your floor price for your NFT collection falls below.
00:23:29.716 - 00:23:32.046, Speaker C: A certain threshold, the gas fees make.
00:23:32.068 - 00:23:38.658, Speaker B: It not worth trading anymore. And that can be really sad for the collection. So you might be able to breathe life into that collection by bridging it.
00:23:38.664 - 00:23:43.410, Speaker C: To optimism because it allows trading to.
00:23:43.480 - 00:23:46.310, Speaker B: Kind of continue even if it's only worth a few dollars.
00:23:46.380 - 00:23:47.846, Speaker C: And in fact, a lot of the.
00:23:47.868 - 00:24:25.278, Speaker B: Collections on optimism are only worth a few dollars. And we also allow creators to create a custom contract for the optimism collection. So what I mean by that is when you bridge an asset from Ethereum to optimism, we deploy a standard plain vanilla open Zeppelin NFT contract for you. That's great for trading and transferring and collecting. But let's say that you now want to add the ability to, I don't.
00:24:25.294 - 00:24:28.866, Speaker C: Know, have your I don't know, two.
00:24:28.888 - 00:24:56.330, Speaker B: NFTs have a baby, for example. I don't know, let's say these two board apes can have a little baby board ape. You're going to need to add some functionality in your smart contract to do that. So if you're looking to extend your layer one NFT collection yeah, CryptoKitties throwback. Thanks, Jacob. If you're looking to extend your NFT collection, you might want to combine that with Bridging.
00:24:57.470 - 00:24:59.002, Speaker C: Because the way the bridge works, remember.
00:24:59.056 - 00:25:02.810, Speaker B: Is you escrow the layer one asset and then you mint a new asset on optimism.
00:25:03.250 - 00:25:06.654, Speaker C: But you can be minting that in.
00:25:06.692 - 00:25:15.714, Speaker B: A standard ERC 721 contract, or you can be minting it in a custom one that adds some functionality. So the goal for Bridging, for us.
00:25:15.752 - 00:25:17.826, Speaker C: Is that you're opening up a new.
00:25:17.848 - 00:25:19.378, Speaker B: Design space, you're doing things that you.
00:25:19.384 - 00:25:22.558, Speaker C: Haven'T been doing before and that we're.
00:25:22.574 - 00:25:24.770, Speaker B: Helping your community scale.
00:25:27.290 - 00:25:28.040, Speaker C: And.
00:25:30.090 - 00:25:31.506, Speaker B: The other piece to that I'll.
00:25:31.538 - 00:25:34.834, Speaker C: Add is that we're looking to integrate.
00:25:34.882 - 00:25:52.058, Speaker B: Our bridge into our launch pad. So we're kind of in a weird purgatory period today with layer two adoption because layer one definitely works and layer twos, they work, but there hasn't been a social consensus about which layer twos.
00:25:52.074 - 00:25:53.600, Speaker C: To pick or.
00:25:57.410 - 00:26:03.646, Speaker B: Their security hasn't been as battle tested as layer one Ethereum, obviously. And so let's say you want to.
00:26:03.668 - 00:26:06.974, Speaker C: Launch a companion collection for your one.
00:26:07.012 - 00:26:13.730, Speaker B: Collection, or you want to launch a brand new collection and you're excited about optimism, but you want to give the community the ability to bridge back to layer one.
00:26:13.880 - 00:26:18.974, Speaker C: We're going to add into our launch pad the ability for you to launch.
00:26:19.022 - 00:26:24.840, Speaker B: A collection on optimism or on Ethereum with, like, Bridging kind of pre built in as part of the plan.
00:26:25.450 - 00:26:27.446, Speaker C: Now, you don't need to have that.
00:26:27.468 - 00:26:36.278, Speaker B: At launch, but we want to, once again give the design affordance to everyone to say, like, hey, think about scaling right now, because when the next bull.
00:26:36.294 - 00:26:39.738, Speaker C: Market kicks off, gas fees might crush your community.
00:26:39.824 - 00:26:51.466, Speaker B: So let's pick a place at launch for us all to move to. Or maybe even you mint the token originally on optimism, but if you don't want to be on optimism in the future, you can bridge back to layer.
00:26:51.498 - 00:26:55.026, Speaker C: One Ethereum, you can kind of plan that out.
00:26:55.048 - 00:26:58.446, Speaker B: So we're still in the design phases of what a cross layer launch pad.
00:26:58.478 - 00:27:05.366, Speaker C: Looks like, where you get the benefits of launching on optimism while still having.
00:27:05.388 - 00:27:10.342, Speaker B: The ability to exit to layer one if you want. That's like a really active area of.
00:27:10.396 - 00:27:13.960, Speaker C: Design and product research for us.
00:27:14.890 - 00:27:26.380, Speaker B: So that concludes the overview I have of the optimism NFT ecosystem. I have a couple of minutes left. So what I might do is just show you our platform.
00:27:29.150 - 00:27:34.990, Speaker C: So this is the Quicks website and.
00:27:35.060 - 00:27:37.470, Speaker B: You can see we're featuring our mirror writing NFTs.
00:27:38.130 - 00:27:43.330, Speaker C: We've recently been doing a OG NFT.
00:27:43.830 - 00:28:18.140, Speaker B: Drop so we gave this early optimist, we name him Tim or Timmy for Optimism. And we gave this to people who were trading on Know in the early days. And so it's really easy to get started. We're at QX App and we encourage anyone who's interested to join, especially one of the lower cost NFT communities and hop in the discord. And if you're a developer, consider checking out what you can build on layer two.
00:28:18.590 - 00:28:24.510, Speaker C: And that kind of wraps up my presentation.
00:28:26.210 - 00:28:32.240, Speaker B: Do I still have some time, Katie? Or should I like should I keep going or turn it back over to you all?
00:28:33.650 - 00:28:49.574, Speaker D: Hey, Mark, I'm going to jump in for Katie. Good to see you here. Yeah, I think we'll just double check if there's any questions or anything. But you're free to use a couple more minutes if you want some more stuff to chat about. Otherwise I'm just going to check if there's any questions.
00:28:49.772 - 00:28:56.352, Speaker C: So give me 1 second here. Cool.
00:28:56.406 - 00:28:58.924, Speaker B: Yeah, I can of course do ecosystem.
00:28:58.972 - 00:29:02.864, Speaker C: Spotlights all day long because we have so many cool.
00:29:02.902 - 00:29:33.880, Speaker B: I'll just keep spotlighting some groups in the ecosystem. So this is called Draconic Egg and it was fun because these were originally Egg NFTs and then they hatched at a specific day which is kind of like a reveal. These were actually generated with I forget which model, but it was like an AI that made all these, which is cool to me anyway. And we've actually seen a lot of Dragon themed collections. The other one I'll spotlight is Dragonia.
00:29:33.960 - 00:29:35.436, Speaker C: And this is like the Play to.
00:29:35.458 - 00:29:42.610, Speaker B: Earn game so these Dragon trainers can fight each other.
00:29:43.620 - 00:29:46.384, Speaker C: And that's a great layer two use.
00:29:46.422 - 00:29:50.108, Speaker B: Case because you don't want to be paying one gas fees when you're interacting.
00:29:50.124 - 00:29:51.540, Speaker C: With the game on chain.
00:29:53.800 - 00:30:03.450, Speaker B: And let me go to this Explore page. We're in the middle of the optimism quest if you haven't heard of that.
00:30:04.060 - 00:30:08.856, Speaker C: Definitely check it out. This is a way to explore the.
00:30:08.878 - 00:30:22.316, Speaker B: Ecosystem and earn these fun NFTs. And you can look at your NFTs on Quicks. So if you've traded on Uniswap, you get one. If you use Synthetix, you get one.
00:30:22.498 - 00:30:26.140, Speaker C: There's all sorts of velodrome is another.
00:30:26.210 - 00:30:53.590, Speaker B: Big decentralized exchange type protocol. If you're writing any article on Mirror that's going to deploy an optimism and show up on Quicks and it'll trade on Quicks. So a lot of fun announcements like this group called Syncswap announced their mission statement and did it on Mirror and they traded several thousand dollars worth of that blog post on Quicks and on optimism. Just pretty fun.
00:30:55.320 - 00:30:56.068, Speaker C: Very cool.
00:30:56.154 - 00:30:57.936, Speaker B: How am I doing on time, Jacob?
00:30:58.048 - 00:31:12.108, Speaker D: I mean, we're right on time. I mean we can wrap up. Really, really cool to have you here, Mark. I mean, Quicks was I guess at the time, quicksodic was probably the first meaningful transaction I did on optimism, otherwise, instead of just sending money to somebody. So it's really cool to have you.
00:31:12.114 - 00:31:12.990, Speaker C: Be a part of.
00:31:15.120 - 00:31:22.400, Speaker B: And yeah, I guess the Easter egg is we used to be called Quicksodic, but we got the feedback that that was really hard to say and hard to spell, so we shortened it to Quicks.
00:31:22.820 - 00:31:23.664, Speaker D: I like the name.
00:31:23.702 - 00:31:24.624, Speaker B: It's nice.
00:31:24.822 - 00:31:25.344, Speaker D: Very cool.
00:31:25.382 - 00:31:30.240, Speaker B: Thanks. Yeah, it's Quick to transact on optimism.
00:31:31.780 - 00:31:46.600, Speaker D: Love it. Awesome. Well, thank you so much. And I love the work that you're doing, especially around education and tying NFTs to getting people to learn more about and just incentivize exploring what's out there on the Optimism network. So it's been awesome to have you here. Thanks, Mark.
00:31:46.670 - 00:31:47.816, Speaker C: Appreciate you being here.
00:31:47.918 - 00:31:48.424, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:31:48.542 - 00:31:49.976, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been great to be here.
00:31:50.078 - 00:32:22.348, Speaker D: Okay, cool. Well, that about wraps it up on our end. So thank you, Mark. Again. And then yeah, on behalf of Katie and I, thank you so much for being a part of this event and for joining us to hear more about the optimism ecosystem, both from the people working on it and from some of the people that are deploying on top of it. So, yeah, we're really excited to be finishing this conversation up and thanks so much. If you're going to want to watch this later, it's available on our YouTube page at ethg global on YouTube.
00:32:22.348 - 00:32:28.620, Speaker D: But otherwise, thank you so much for joining us and we hope to see you at our next summit tomorrow.
