00:00:04.010 - 00:01:18.722, Speaker A: All right, well, welcome and thank you for coming out. As I was thinking about what I would say to introduce the event and panel, I thought about a quote from George Bernard Shaw and he said, a lot of people see things the way they they are and they say, Why? But I dream of things as they ought to be and say, Why not? Why not? So that's actually at the essence and the spirit of not just ETH Waterloo and ETH Global and hackathons and people dreaming up new ideas and things like that. It's also what makes Waterloo waterloo. And it's a line that the president of the university, dr. David Johnson, who was the Governor General of Canada, oftentimes would open up his speeches with that Bernard Shaw line. And so I thought to myself, yesterday we had opening ceremonies for Eastwaterloo and the principal message that VM Horn and Kartik Telwar said on stage was, dream big. Dream big.
00:01:18.722 - 00:02:07.798, Speaker A: And today we have a number of people who have not only dreamt quite big, but who have actually realized their dreams. And you're going to hear from them. We're really proud to present that. And so rewind the clock two and a half years ago, Kartik and theem, they approached me and said, hey, we want to throw the world's largest Ethereum hackathon in Waterloo. Would you be willing to help? And after I got over how lucky I was to be asked, I immediately jumped at the opportunity. And so I want to take a moment to describe what's transpired since then because they've assembled a team that's been absolutely remarkable. And those individuals deserve a lot of credit for what's going on here today.
00:02:07.798 - 00:03:37.010, Speaker A: Across the hall over here, as well as what's happened since in the two years that's transpired, they've taken this prototype of this Ethereum hackathon and they've gone global because all these communities around the world said, hey, we want our own ethuada. And so, 14 events later from San Francisco to New York, denver, Buenos Aires, Argentina, bangalore, India, Singapore, Berlin, Paris the list goes on and on. It's been absolutely remarkable seeing them take their vision and inspire communities around the world to basically hack on top of the Ethereum Platform. And so to quantify 14 events, there was over 10,000 developer applicants from all over the world that have applied for ETH global events from 75 different countries. And so that team that made that happen include the following individuals kartif Telwar, liam horn, josh stark heather campbell, andrew Dunscomb and Jacob Wilson. So if you could join me in a round of applause for those. I continue to be in awe of them and what they've been able to accomplish.
00:03:37.010 - 00:04:26.850, Speaker A: For those of you who are from out of town, you might be thinking, what the fuck is this building? Well, this used to be an old whiskey distillery, but now it's the home of Shopify in Waterloo. And shopify has been unbelievable. Partner in helping us put this event together. And I wanted to thank them. Specifically, I wanted to thank Paul Moretti, who's sitting right up there. Thank you, Paul Connolly, who's also been instrumental putting this together. Toby at Chopify said this could quite possibly be the nicest office space in all of Tech.
00:04:26.850 - 00:05:06.174, Speaker A: But then, of course, he said the King and Portland Center was probably the nicest office space in all of Tech in any you know, two years ago, when we also were looking for other partners to help us bring this event to you, two other parties that I wanted to recognize. They're sitting in the back of the room is Usman Sheikh and Sean Gomez from Gallons. Usman runs a blockchain practice at Gallons, and they jumped at the opportunity to back us early on when we had nothing but an idea. And so I wanted to thank you for backing us then, and I wanted to thank you for sponsoring and helping us out now.
00:05:06.212 - 00:05:06.960, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:05:13.810 - 00:06:05.138, Speaker A: And so Liam insisted on me mentioning that this is intended to be a conversation. This is not necessarily supposed to be lecture style. So if there's something that's not clear or if you want to interrupt, ask a question that's highly encouraged. This is meant to be a forum to share ideas, as I mentioned. And so please, by all means, raise a hand if you want to discuss something or if you want to ask a question about what's been mentioned, because we're going to be talking about three central topics today. It's going to be crypto economics, followed by panel on decentralized finance, DFI, followed by effectively web3 or Internet money, if you will. So that's coming up as well.
00:06:05.138 - 00:06:47.070, Speaker A: And with that said, I wanted to also just recognize special friends in the room. Dr. John English, who used to be the executive director of the center for International Governance Innovation in this building before shopify took it, and Dr. John English and CG, in fact, has been a huge partner. So right now, as we speak today, there's hundreds of hackers next door working on projects that will be presented tomorrow to the judges. Many of them are in the room here with us. And so CG deserves a lot of credit and recognition for helping us by giving us their gorgeous building.
00:06:47.070 - 00:07:22.650, Speaker A: So. Hi, John. For any other sponsor in the room, the Sponsor Party thank you. Party is this evening just down the street at the communitech data hub, and that's from seven to 09:00 p.m.. So we look forward to hosting all of you there. But without further ado, I would like to turn it over to the inventor, creator, and founder of Sirium, the one and only Vitalik Guitar. And thank you for coming back, Vitalik.
00:07:58.100 - 00:09:44.662, Speaker B: So, yeah, I guess today I'm going to talk about urban economics. Start off, let's go back about ten years to the original creation of Bitcoin. So before 2009, we were in the dark ages where all we had was money issued by different central authorities and different kinds of commodity money, things like gold and so forth. And in 2009, satoshi came along with bitcoin, which showed us anyway. But what exactly is so interesting about this? Right? Different people have different answers to this question, but what is interesting about bitcoin and things that came after it that kind of did? What is the thing that allowed it to exist in previous systems and previous so one common answer that people give is that general's problem here are sort of the visitor generals problem, okay? So their visit degenerate problem basically kind of has to do with the possibility of a distributed group of people kind of coming together and reading out a message, right? The original setup is basically you have a town and you have a group of armies around the town if they want to try to coordinate and attack against the town at the same time. But any messengers that the army send between each other could be treaters, could be intercepted. The channels between them have some error rates.
00:09:44.662 - 00:11:06.166, Speaker B: Can you still make sure that you a lot of people have this idea that visit general's problem was not solved until satoshi 17. But the reality is that the resident generals problem was solved by Leslie. So distributed consensus as a thing is more than 35 years old. The ability to have a network where you have multiple nodes, multiple nodes talk to each other, they transmit messages between each other, and they all agree on some kind of common module of transactions. This is actually stuff that has been possible to do for more than 35 years. So what did satoshi really advance, right? What did satoshi kind of come up with that these systems were distributed consensus that existed long before bitcoin was created did not happen? And my answer to this question is crypto economics. So first of all, what is crypto economics? Crypto economics is the combination of cryptography and economic incentives to try to create systems where you can have some kind of guarantee that these systems will work in the way that you say that they'll work.
00:11:06.166 - 00:11:37.054, Speaker B: Blockchains are an example of a flu economic growth for anyone who is kind of remotely familiar with how blockchains work. You have a chain of blocks and every block points to some previous block. And the intended functionality of the setup is that you have a block, someone creates a new block, that new block gets added to the chain, someone else creates a newer block, that newer block gets added to the chain, and the whole thing just kind of grows. One point, the thing you don't want.
00:11:37.092 - 00:11:38.490, Speaker C: To have happen is forks.
00:11:38.570 - 00:12:44.114, Speaker B: You don't want to have kind of two blocks over here that are conflicting with each other happen. Because what that means is that one of those two blocks has to get thrown out and some transactions get reverted. So Bitcoin and other proof of work, blockchain and other blockchains in general use crypto economic techniques to try to encourage participants to participate in the system directly and try to help make the chain grow instead of just going off and building blocks somewhere else. So the way that Bitcoin and Ethereum and other blockchains do this is the app block rewards, right? If you beat a block that is part of the chain, then you get a reward. If you beat a block that is not part of the chain, then you do not get a reward. So incentives, right? So basically it's one of the kind of key things that Bitcoin and other Satoshi platforms have is they use incentives.
00:12:44.162 - 00:12:45.558, Speaker C: In this particular way.
00:12:45.724 - 00:13:55.492, Speaker B: Now, another thing that they have is what I call economic weight assignments. So these decentralized consensus systems that existed in the 1980s and 1990s, bbsd and Paxos, all of these buzwords, all of these systems, they were able to get some number of nodes to talk to each other, right? You could get 15 computers together. Those 15 computers would exchange messages and the system would continue running as long as at least ten of those or at least eleven of those computers are functioning correctly. Any four of them could fail in some arbitrary way, but as long as not more than four of them fail, the system is fine. What's the problem here? Right? You go up from having one computer to having 15 computers, but you still have to agree on who these 15 computers are. So the thing that Satoshi was trying to do, basically creating a decentralized digital currency. Well, okay, so what we're trying to do here is we're trying to create digital gold.
00:13:55.492 - 00:14:48.176, Speaker B: We're basically trying to create this kind of store payment mechanism and store value. And we want this thing to be used by people around the world, and we want this to be used. How would people even agree on who these computers are, right? So the trust problem is somewhat mitigated, but it's not all mitigated. If you choose, we'll say, okay, well, let's take 15 companies. We'll do wheel trust, the same 15 companies. Are we going to say it's 15 countries, we'll do wheelchair. So even going from one computer to n computers doesn't kind of solve this problem of providing the neutrality that people are looking for that is kind of necessary to help to allow this kind of system to gain more widespread acceptance.
00:14:48.176 - 00:15:41.764, Speaker B: So economic way of having what do I mean by this? So things like Bitcoin and Ethereum are fully provisional systems, meaning anyone can participate at any layer of the step. Anyone can read the blockchain, anyone can send transactions on the blockchain, and anyone can participate in creating blockchain blockchain. Now, the problem here is that this is a fully provisional system. It's also anonymous system. The internet doesn't have some super reliable standard of identifying unique people and block production. It's kind of like a voting game, right? Block product. Producing these blocks is this mechanism where if an attacker is able to produce more blocks than the rest of the network put together then they can revert whatever transactions they want and they can basically break the system.
00:15:41.764 - 00:16:13.824, Speaker B: And so you have this problem called civil attacks, right? So a civil attack, basically is let's say we have a permissionless network and some group of computers are participating. And I am going to join the network. And in this network, I am going to spin up 2000 Virtual Machines. And I'm just going to pretend that each of these 2000 Virtual Machines is a network computer. And I'm going to claim, look guys, I'm 2000 people. I'm more than everyone else put together. You should listen to me.
00:16:13.824 - 00:17:32.988, Speaker B: So because applications on the internet are kind of fundamentally anonymous in this way it's not the sort of environment where just kind of counting self secret identities is secure. And so what we do instead is instead of trying to count self secured identities we're going to count economic resources. So the way that Bitcoin and Ethereum currently work is that producing one of these blocks is deliberately designed to take up a very large amount of computing. It's somewhere on the order of 1 billion trillion computations in order to have a block. And you have these extremely large mining parts everywhere, everywhere around the world that are constantly trying to crank out these developers. And the reason why we have this mechanism is so that if someone else joins the network then they try to kind of start a chain from somewhere behind in history and try to convince the network that their chain is the real chain. Instead of just having to have more identities than the rest of the networks combined they would have to have more economic resources than the other.
00:17:32.988 - 00:18:59.522, Speaker B: And this is something which is very difficult to fail. It's very difficult to come up with more economic resources than all of the resources that are being blocked on something like Bitcoin network or something like the Ethereum network. And proof of Stake also works in a kind of similar way except proof of Stake instead of counting economic resources by looking at computing power proof of stake counts economic resources by looking at points. So in either case this idea of using kind of economics for gatekeeping allows us to kind of balance two different goals in a way that was not possible before. It allows us to have both fully open permissionless, open access systems and at the same time have those systems not be exploitable or at least not be easily exploitable. So these two things together are crypto economic tools and they're the tools that make the Bitcoin blockchain work, that make the Ethereum blockchain work and that make any other blockchain work. So how does crypto economic mechanism design? So there's the crypto and there's the economics economics means that you're securing the system using economic limitations and incentives.
00:18:59.522 - 00:19:42.110, Speaker B: And the crypto means that you're kind of using cryptography as the broad building blocks that are the substrate that you are kind of building things on top of. Right? When we say every block points to a previous block, we mean every block contains hash of a previous block. And so you have this kind of a link between two objects that you can't forge. You use digital signatures to prove that someone read a sub message. You might use zero proofs to prove that the message has certain properties. So you have the crypto and the economics. Economics probably even though you need the crypto as the base building block, the economics takes more of a center stage when you try to actually analyze these systems.
00:19:42.110 - 00:21:31.694, Speaker B: So we're trying to incentivize great behavior and we're trying to we want to create systems where if you join these systems, we have no idea who you are. And so we have no idea whether or not you're kind of intrinsically aligned with the system's operation. And so we want to kind of provide some explicit incentives that say if you do things that help the system run well, then you get more of a reward. If you act in ways that cause the system to run poorly, you don't get a reward. And if you act in ways that cause the system to break poorly, then you should suffer a large penalty. So one kind of common critique of this that people often make is they ask, well, what about attackers that have a really large extra protocol incentive? So what about attackers who are not just trying to break a system to make money off it? What about attackers that just have some other rule that they have that makes them want to be a system break? So, for example, if you are, let's say, one of the core developers of some cryptocurrency and there's some other cryptocurrency which is a unit, if you're kind of people, you might want to pack that potentially sometimes people just go crazy. These kinds of actors exist in the world, right? And so if we focus on economic incentives and if we focus on things like cost of attacks, then you might ask, well, are we protecting against both of these threats at all? By the way, this is a QR code.
00:21:31.694 - 00:22:32.124, Speaker B: It's a possibility. I'm trying to have a kind of fair so here's why I replied to this, right? So first of all, there's definitely limits to the realism of economic modeling. There's limits to this idea that people are guided by incentives. And there definitely are people who are stupid. There's people who are just acting waste because they have people who have personal goals that fall outside of our model. And all of these things exist, right? But the alternative ways of modeling decentralized systems are generally, in my view, even more unrealistic, especially in a fully opened. For example, when you do non economic analysis of decentralized systems, we often assume that more than one half are honest and more than one half are outros to be honest.
00:22:32.124 - 00:23:42.420, Speaker B: So they're willing to be honest even when they haven't been incentive not to be honest. And there's this example that happened a couple of years ago that kind of proves how relying on altruistic honesty is not enough, right? So this was the Bitcoin SBD mining kind of situation. And what happened here was in order to save on costs, miners started validating or building blocks without verifying the other blocks they were building on top of. And this saved cost for verification. But what it meant is that at some point eventually someone accidentally created an impala block and six other blocks are built on top of it and all six of these blocks. So we actually see how if we do not kind of try hard to incentivize good behavior, that sometimes does not kind of like devil for evil behavior, but basic behavior can happen pretty easily. Sometimes kind of more subtle forms of defection can happen pretty easily.
00:23:42.420 - 00:24:42.400, Speaker B: So you want to have systems that try to be kind of secure in as many of these ways as possible. Second, there's limits to an attacker's ability to profit. So if he wants to attack a system, then I'm going to attack some Bitcoin, I'm going to attack Bitcoin SD and I'm going to try to before I do this, I'm going to short Bitcoin SD on financial markets. And the theory is like, step one, short the coin on financial market. Step two, attack the coin. Step three, profit price goes down. And the claim is, well, even if it's expensive to attack, then if you can profit more from an attack more than the attack costs, then is the system not insecure? And my answer is, well, this is exactly why kind of cost of attack analysis is important.
00:24:42.400 - 00:25:43.912, Speaker B: The more expensive you can make it to attack a system, the less likely it is that it will be possible to actually profit from an attack. Financial markets are not infinitely deemed. A competitor's interest in breaking a currency is not infinite. A government's interest in breaking incentives to do these things are not infinite. And so system we reduce the probability that there will be someone with enough of an incentive to break. And also even nonprofit motivated attackers have to consider questions. So a nonprofit motivated attacker is the example? Not always, but often if they're crazy, it's harder to get attackers that have kind of motives that we can't predict at all.
00:25:43.912 - 00:27:35.388, Speaker B: There's just limits to how much money they have and to how many times they're even capable of spending those resources to make them break, regardless of what they're going to and often for extrinsic resources, right? So like for example, if you're trying to attack a system, then often in the real world you care about deniably in the real world. You care about it not being known that you're the one who did the attack. And getting resources deniably tends to be harder than getting resources. So sometimes virtually decrease the ecosystem in a lot of ways and becomes less likely that so crypto economics are used to secure blockchains, right? And we've seen a lot of these principles in action. We've seen, for example, that there are blockchains that are maybe like Ethereum and Costa and they have been successfully attacked, right? If the cost of attacking a chain is somewhere between $5,000 then there's plenty of just a random 14 year old teenagers that earns $5,000 because they bought loss. If you can get the cost of attack up to the $1 million level, the number of people capable something like Ethereum not technically successful. Now, crypto economic techniques are useful for designing blockchains because the crypto economic kind of way of thinking assumes very little about the actors that are participating in the system.
00:27:35.388 - 00:29:08.424, Speaker B: It assumes very little about kind of their personal beliefs about whether or not the system is good or there just assumes resources are bounded. It's useful for blockchains because blockchains are this open permissionless environment where the protocol itself inherently has no idea about anything about who its participants are. It can also be useful in application layer contexts. So proof of stake for antispam this is one idea that I've come up with and some other people have come up with. And this is basically saying that in order to prevent spam and this could be email spam, this could be just spam, denial of service, attacks against websites, this could be lots of different things. Then we can try to limit these kinds of attacks by basically relying on having a system where you put down a deposit and putting down a deposit gives you the ability to send some number of messages and if those messages turn out to be kind of spam or unwanted or attacks, you using some balance. And this is something that we've been considering even such as using lower level protocols.
00:29:08.424 - 00:30:23.178, Speaker B: This is something that you can use in higher level applications. It's usable as a general principle in a lot of contexts and you can even kind of take this kind of principle and use traditional crypto context, right? So like for example, there was an internet forum if you got banned, we simply have to keep running again and this deed actually moderately success quality. So these kinds of incentives can sometimes be quite effective. Crypto Economic Life Alliance so the idea here is that within blockchain protocols can make it easier for applications to do things like searching through data. So one example of this is that even the Ethereum blockchain itself, there's a fairly large amount of data inside of it. There's about 200GB of data in it and many application. Most of that data is history.
00:30:23.178 - 00:31:51.320, Speaker B: Most of that data is things that happened before that most people don't care about now, but that some applications care about, like some applications care about kind of fetching events that happen in the history. And right now every kind of full node in the network is required to store all this information. But what we can do instead is we can have this protocol that says if some individual wants a piece of data, instead of asking some their own node and querying for all of it themselves, they can just kind of ask the network for the data and the network just nodes in the network can then reply back and they can say, here are the results in your search query. I certify that these are the results and that there are no other results. And if someone else comes up with a proof that there actually is another result then their original signed message and can be kind of published into a smart contract and they can have some deposits. So you can use economic policies to also create these kinds of decentralized search protocols just through databases like even for example, Blockchain's own history. And if you do this then this is kind of one of the major passports interactive computation.
00:31:51.320 - 00:33:31.262, Speaker B: This is another kind of fun example. So the idea here basically is suppose that you have some computation and you want an application on the blockchain to learn the result of the computation without having to do the entire doing a computation on a blockchain is fairly expensive because a blockchain is as complicated, maybe tens of thousands. But you can create this kind of layer two protocol that basically says well how about instead of doing the entire computation launches where each of those pieces can be done on chain if you want to. But at first we're not going to do so at first. Instead what we're going to do is we're just going to wait for someone to submit what they think the x's are. So I can run a computation, I can save a bunch of intermediate data that says here is the input, here is the input after I bought it for 1000 and I can submit a sequence of values to just say here are all of these intermediate checkpoints and I push them into some. Then there's a challenge period, right? So to illustrate this with an example, let's say, suppose that in reality calculating two to the power of sand is very easy.
00:33:31.262 - 00:34:08.170, Speaker B: But suppose that calculating two to the power of ten is very hard. Let's say that some smart contracts on Blockchain wants to learn what is two to the power of ten. And so what you do is you can submit a trace where the first trace is the first step is the input. Then every step is the previous step. Multiplied by two you have ten steps and the last step is the output. And let's suppose that you have some submitter who's bullish. Let's say you have some submitter that just is really, really tired about this stupid distinction between kilobytes with 1000 bytes and two bytes.
00:34:08.170 - 00:34:57.830, Speaker B: And the submitter wants to convince the world once and for all that two to the power of ten. So here is what they do. They submit a trace where they say one, 2418, 16, 326-412-8255, hundred, 1000. And they claim well, this is me and taking multiple multiplying it by two and doubling it ten times. Since here's what I get on the answer. Now, if you have this kind of trace, this trace is wrong, right? Who here thinks that two to the power of ten is not 1000? Pretty strong. So if the computation is wrong, there has to be some initial step at which the computation is wrong.
00:34:57.830 - 00:35:52.134, Speaker B: And it turns out that the initial step is over here. So there exists a challenge period, right? The blockchain does not accept the submission immediately. It accepts a submission and then it kind of waits for about a week. And during the challenge period anyone else can submit an index and they can say hey, I think that the computation starts being broad suffer over here. And they go and they points to this position and then only when they do the challenge the blockchain contract on the blockchain, they go and say okay, well, someone is claiming that the step between these two submissions fraud. I'm going to check it. And so they take 128 now on chain, multiply it by two and they see a weight, it's 256 and not 250.
00:35:52.134 - 00:37:15.900, Speaker B: And so this original submitter submitted something wrong and so they should be penalized. So the idea here is that in the normal case, people are going to be honest because they know that if they submitted something that is dishonest, someone else will catch them and they're not going to get the honest answer, they're not going to get the wrong answer through and they'll be penalized for it. But if they submit an honest, the system might wait about a week and after this they will report. So this is one example of a purpose economic technique that you can variants of this have been proposed to be something in the form of things like optimistic roll up to try to some mandatory caveats because you need either some selective altruistic actors or actors that kind of have other reasons to check the computation themselves. Because otherwise you have this kind of equal program where if nobody cheats, that nobody checks, and then somebody can cheat around that. And also you want to give it reveals software economics, right? So there's also kind of higher level analyst economics. So one of them is Oracles.
00:37:15.900 - 00:38:58.340, Speaker B: And the thing that these all have in common is they try to use economic techniques but they try to solve problems that are kind of higher levels and that really start to come closer to well, is this really crypto economics or is this just kind. Of doing mechanism design just using the blockchain as a substrate. So Oracle, the idea here is well, how can the blockchain get information about the real world? Like let's say the blockchain wants to learn what is the price of $100 or the blockchain wants to learn what is the temperature of Waterloo? Like any of these factors you cannot cryptographically are high. Then there's been this kind of branch of thought about well, how do we create systems that still give people incentive to try a kind of publish on chain the correct answer and there are some answers that kind of variants of this are used by there's also the kind of question of some subjectivity versus exploral economic mechanisms for other tasks. So in my panel yesterday, I mentioned public interest projects. So this is one of the alternatives I like. And the idea here basically is that instead of giving your money all at once, you kind of put your money in a contract and basically just the interest portfolio that you some project over time.
00:38:58.340 - 00:40:23.658, Speaker B: And so instead of a project getting all of its money immediately and then possibly running away with it, a project kind of gets its money more solely over time. And if people stop being satisfied with the project, then the project can then people have the ability to manage those app. Right? So we can also think about blockchain and specifically smart contracts can be a really kind of nice and convenient tool for doing those sorts of things and the dividing line between perfectly denoting here's another really fun example, this is Uniswap ninja. So what happens here is basically so uniswap is a decentralized exchange and one of the problems that uniswap has is that lots of people issue tokens and one thing that has happened to an ethereum a few times is that people have created fake tokens. So lots of people love, I don't know, MKR, and people want to buy and trade MKR. So someone else creates a new token, print so much of it themselves. And they also call their token FKR and they try to convince people that this token is FDR, they should buy it.
00:40:23.658 - 00:42:09.138, Speaker B: And they kind of steal money from people. So Uniswap Ng is the kind of alternative interface to uniswap, which is one decentralized exchange. And what it does is it uses Claros, which is one of these not quite an oracle platform, but it does understand more things to basically maintain a list in a decentralized way that basically says kind of which cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain is legitimate and which actually corresponds to which ticker symbol, which corresponds to which logo and which one does. And this can be this kind of self updating decentralized interface that helps people trade one token for another token but at the same time kind of protect from fake tokens that pretend to be something that they're not. So this is another kind of interesting example of crypto economics techniques being used to solve kind of software problems that are out there. So crypto economics, it's core to blockchain design, it's core to how things like proof of work and how proof of stake work. And Crypto Weekend, it allows us to create these systems that we can have some kind of high reliability, that these systems are going to function as expected and these systems are not going to break without having to rely on basically centralized distrust of third parties.
00:42:09.138 - 00:43:14.930, Speaker B: So you can create systems that kind of go across the entire world and where people, regardless of where they come from, they can look at the logic, they can look at they're likely to be more inclined to see it as a system that they can trust. Crypto economics can be used at the application layer in a lot of contexts. And there is that kind of a big spectrum here where sometimes the group you can use it to just help with computational tasks such as this interactive computation for example. And then there's also kind of softer things like trying to create these ways of getting information from the real world into the blockchain. And really there is this kind of spectrum of different techniques that I highly encourage people to learn about. And if you're going to be hacking this or future hackathons that, Beauty Chicks is already lined up with you.
00:43:19.860 - 00:43:40.204, Speaker A: We have time for five minutes of questions. If you have a question, please raise your hand and we'll run over a mic for you. Anybody with a question in the room for a question for people who are new to it.
00:43:40.322 - 00:43:42.190, Speaker D: I saw that you mentioned.
00:43:45.840 - 00:43:52.400, Speaker A: Is there almost like a shopify version of that where it would provide underlining?
00:43:55.450 - 00:44:14.650, Speaker B: I think Microsoft actually did exactly this a week ago these things. Hello. Hello.
00:44:15.500 - 00:44:23.548, Speaker A: So I actually asked you a question at Cryptochex last summer about what you thought the first application of AI would.
00:44:23.554 - 00:44:26.824, Speaker B: Be to blockchain and you cited Arbitrage.
00:44:26.872 - 00:44:29.468, Speaker E: Bots and also cited Uniswap.
00:44:29.644 - 00:44:32.604, Speaker A: So these tools are designed to improve.
00:44:32.652 - 00:44:34.684, Speaker E: Liquidity and reduce spread.
00:44:34.812 - 00:44:36.972, Speaker A: But do you think that while liquidity.
00:44:37.036 - 00:44:39.436, Speaker E: Is essential to the pricing of assets.
00:44:39.548 - 00:45:04.908, Speaker A: There are still dangers with it unrestrained liquidity? For instance, in traditional markets with high frequency trading we've seen things like flash crashes such that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has stuff like breakers to stop trading if it's getting out of hand. So the CME is obviously a centralized entity that can stop trading, but no such thing could exist in a decentralized manner. Do you see that as a potentially issue?
00:45:05.074 - 00:46:28.944, Speaker B: I think there's a large design space in decentralized markets that people haven't really kind of properly explored yet. One example of this that I've talked about a bunch of times is like frequent batch auctions. So this is this idea that basically instead of processing trades one by one, you kind of take in trades. You wait until the end of 1 second or 1 minute or some time interval and then you process some kind of easy order in which prices come. And the reason why we want to do this is because if you do this then high frequency trading kind of stops becoming a profitable thing to do. There's no benefit to having latency that's lower than some portion of whatever the high frequency trading or whatever the interval is, right? It's definitely the case that there's different kinds of markets and that market structure matters and there definitely isn't a possibility of creating market structures that have kind of some level of centralization to them. And one of the benefits of the crypto space is that it makes it kind of easy for different people to try out and implement different designs.
00:46:28.944 - 00:47:54.126, Speaker B: And I know people are trying to implement some of these designs in some ways. I think this is a problem that can't just be solved through newer and newer and better market mechanisms being built on top of Ethereum at the same over time. The one thing that's nothing to do though is that if you have an asset then you can't guarantee that it will you could, but it's less easy to guarantee that it will only be traded on one exchange. And so the mechanic that you do have here is that exchanges are less of a monopoly, and so you have to deal with different exchanges and how they interact with each other. And that's something that definitely exists in the traditional finance, but it's something that in the long term, I can see being more productive than the crypto space. I guess in general I think it's my view of kind of how to think of the crypto space is that it's a place that makes it easier to different kinds of systems. There are different ways to structure things like markets and so one of them is better.
00:47:54.126 - 00:48:18.840, Speaker B: It's something that could end up existing exchanges whereby decentralized exchanges need to look like something like Bitfinex or Polonia X three Uniswap for example. But I'm also not 100% buffet there because there is this possibility that will interact with each other.
00:48:26.530 - 00:48:33.130, Speaker E: In terms of node scalability. Right now it's untenable for a normal person to run a node and you.
00:48:33.140 - 00:48:35.438, Speaker D: Mentioned keeping only the last million blocks.
00:48:35.454 - 00:48:37.090, Speaker E: Or four months of transactions.
00:48:39.030 - 00:48:39.778, Speaker B: Instead.
00:48:39.944 - 00:48:41.886, Speaker E: What about an approach where you shard.
00:48:41.918 - 00:48:43.346, Speaker D: The history or there's some kind of.
00:48:43.368 - 00:48:48.434, Speaker E: Proof of reproducibility like different people promise.
00:48:48.482 - 00:48:50.262, Speaker D: To have different parts of the history.
00:48:50.396 - 00:49:17.124, Speaker B: That's basically what the idea behind things crypto economic life. That definitely is how it will happen. How do you feel about the growing.
00:49:17.172 - 00:49:27.234, Speaker D: DeFi space and whether apps could have if their dev team decides to make.
00:49:27.272 - 00:49:29.202, Speaker E: A DAP, not that they necessarily would.
00:49:29.256 - 00:49:32.020, Speaker D: But say dai disappears or goes on.
00:49:42.990 - 00:50:04.980, Speaker B: It will definitely be an interesting test. I definitely think that I guess first of all, I definitely think that if there is a team that some team that tries to do something like that for malicious reasons, then we should.
00:50:06.710 - 00:50:07.026, Speaker C: Have.
00:50:07.048 - 00:50:51.000, Speaker B: An agreement that we're just basically going to say, screw you, and we'll fork machine anyway, even if it caused a lot of damage. And not because causing a lot of damage is good, but because having that pre commitment is important to discourage that kind of behavior from happening in the workplace. But there are definitely going to be cases where there are kind of legitimate disagreements over technical issues. But historically, I think people generally, the ethereum community has been pretty good at handling those kinds of things well. There have been cases where kind of some people were favored, and generally.
00:50:53.500 - 00:50:53.960, Speaker E: People.
00:50:54.030 - 00:52:05.024, Speaker B: Have kind of gone along with whatever the winning decision ended up being. And at the same time, people have also avoided kind of proposing. Right now, I feel like we're in a position where we can't protocol development can still progress, kind of even if in the future things stop being that way and it does start going toward kind of partisanship and really just off into a floor, then you definitely see that kind of just slowing down the ethereum development in a lot of ways. That sort of thing would also have other kind of harmful effects on ethereum's culture, I think. So it's better we kind of try hard to make sure we avoid falling in.
00:52:05.222 - 00:53:09.360, Speaker A: Thank you. If you can join me, a round of applause for Michael Dunsworth Wire. If you could come up to the stage, as well as Joey Crew, Marcelo Cortez, Will you guys know me? Come on up to the stage, please. Just form of housekeeping. If anybody is interested in washroom, they're on the second floor. You can use the stairs in the back.
00:53:25.600 - 00:53:35.024, Speaker F: Hi, everyone. Thanks for having us. Vitalik. That's fantastic. Can we put a round of applause again for him? I think as a creator of all.
00:53:35.062 - 00:53:35.650, Speaker B: This.
00:53:40.740 - 00:54:06.904, Speaker F: It so quick and through, I guess, make an introduction. Joey Crew, co founder of Auger, which is actually the first one of the first ERC, 20 tokens on Ethereum. We've got Will Warren from Zero X, which is pretty much pioneering, like moving the needle on decentralized exchanges trading. And then Marcelo from, I believe, your local homegrown hero, right?
00:54:07.102 - 00:54:08.090, Speaker D: That's right.
00:54:08.860 - 00:54:37.750, Speaker F: So formerly in Cash app and now the founder at sorry, what's a little so I thought there might have been a French tweaked the name. Guys, great to have you and thanks for being here. I wanted to start it off with you. What problems are you seeing that are appealing? What's decentralized finance appealing to you? What's making it appealing to you?
00:54:38.440 - 00:54:39.750, Speaker A: Well, I mean, especially.
00:54:41.640 - 00:54:42.516, Speaker B: I worked for.
00:54:42.538 - 00:54:43.750, Speaker D: Four years at Square.
00:54:45.100 - 00:54:48.072, Speaker B: I started building the Cash app back in 2013.
00:54:48.126 - 00:55:12.544, Speaker D: And I experienced all the pain of dealing with a very legacy system of decentralized banking in the US. Specifically, but all over the world. And I don't really see a way for it to evolve at the speed that we needed to evolve to match what we need in 2020 advancements of.
00:55:12.582 - 00:55:14.290, Speaker B: Technology that we have had.
00:55:14.980 - 00:55:25.970, Speaker D: For me, it's really exciting to see what this guy is doing here and just imagining what would be possible when this becomes mainstream, really mainstream, that is.
00:55:27.960 - 00:55:32.950, Speaker F: Will, what do you think the biggest problem that you guys what does success look like for you guys?
00:55:33.820 - 00:55:34.664, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:34.862 - 00:56:14.560, Speaker E: So at Zero X, we have a mission to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. And for us, that means seeing that all forms of value end up tokenized on public blockchains that are globally accessible. So this could range from assets like fiat currencies, like gaming items, prediction markets, securities. And so we believe that if this value ends up tokenized on public blockchains, it'll democratize financial services in the same way the Internet democratize access to information. So that's what motivates.
00:56:18.580 - 00:56:29.960, Speaker F: August a beast. It's a long time coming. It's been very methodically built. Can you tell the audience a bit more about Auger? Because I feel like there's a lot of complexity to it and you'd be able to emphasize that really well, sure.
00:56:30.030 - 00:57:10.950, Speaker C: So put simply, Auger is designed to be the world's most accessible no limit editing platform. And we built a lot of infrastructure surrounding that, a lot of stuff surrounding decentralized Oracles. But from the end user facing standpoint, that's really what it is. The idea is that similar to how Bitcoin enables them to do kind of global no limit transactions from point A to point B, variable fees, auger is trying to do the same thing, but for any market, it's basically political markets will trudeau and reelection. The Auger market for that was actually bigger than the corresponding fair market. And then things like sports, finance, things like that.
00:57:11.800 - 00:58:15.144, Speaker F: So would it show a fan who used any decentralized finance products or DeFi products? Nice. Okay, so for those of you that don't know, banks typically are constructed of multiple products. Lending, borrowing, earnings, things like that. Now, when products come to market, like whether it's revolut or TransferWise or cash app, it's too difficult for them to do it all on their own. So what they do, they go to a bank that is going to permit it, they're going to white label all those services, or they're going to aggregate and cherry pick vesta for each service. So it becomes sort of this s by 1000 papercard, so to speak, in that I feel like one of the most important things about open finance is collaboration and trying to focus and be an expert in the area that you've picked up, that you're responsible for. I'd love to know how important is collaboration or is it more of a cooperation situation now?
00:58:15.182 - 00:58:38.550, Speaker D: Collaboration is definitely very important. One of the big reasons for us to create the cash app or one of the largest difficulties for us in the early days is in the US. Banks don't talk to each other, they don't elaborate. In Canada we have ways, email transfer, we can send money to each other. It's not the greatest solution, but you can send money from one bank to another.
00:58:39.000 - 00:58:40.368, Speaker F: Is that interact?
00:58:40.544 - 00:58:49.236, Speaker D: Well, it's built on top of interact, but in the US before the cash app, there is no way that you belong to a different bank.
00:58:49.268 - 00:58:50.584, Speaker B: You can't send money to the other.
00:58:50.622 - 00:59:37.130, Speaker D: Person without writing a check or doing something. Those systems are very old and legacy mainframes and it's not a thing that will change from day to night. That's why I believe if you rethink how that works and crypto obvious is building all these protocols that makes all of this possible in the world of today and you rethink all of that with collaboration, building things that will streamline the APIs for how these things should be done. How do you talk to any other financial institution? The same rules applies to everybody. You don't need to have contacts with another company in order to be able to use some of this technology, make these things happen. The world in my opinion is a much better place.
00:59:40.060 - 00:59:56.750, Speaker F: With the marketplace, right? You've got let's say artisanal goods going into boutique stores and matching so people that are looking to supply inventory, create inventory, would you ever see tokenization of those products onto something like zero X in the future?
00:59:58.640 - 01:00:02.750, Speaker D: That's a good question. Definitely yes.
01:00:03.120 - 01:00:05.108, Speaker B: It's very hard to see the path.
01:00:05.144 - 01:00:13.330, Speaker D: From where we are today to getting to that. We have to go one step at a time, but that would be a much better place to be for sure.
01:00:13.880 - 01:00:45.580, Speaker F: And just on top of that, one of the things I think that's really interesting about when you look at marketplaces and things like that is predictions, future insurance and being able to create specific outcomes or at least forecast for them. Guys, generally speaking, how important is predictability to controlling risk in the market? And if risk is going to hinder adoption and the uptake of these products, do you think that that's going to be necessary?
01:00:47.840 - 01:01:37.436, Speaker C: Yes, I'd say the thing on risk is there's probably a few big risks in the cryptocurrency space right now. One is like smart contract risk, so is the smart contract you're using actually secure? And that's actually really a hard risk price because the obvious thing is like well let's make a smart contract, bet on smart contract risk. That doesn't really work because you're basically just creating a person solution. So you haven't really gotten rid of the risk and you also haven't really even hedged against the risk. That's a tough one. Getting better tooling to make it easier to write since yours more contracts, that sort of thing helps fix it and then you also just have systemic risks that are hard to think about. Like a good example of this is MakerDAO and the collateral back end.
01:01:37.436 - 01:01:52.770, Speaker C: That's like a really novel system that nothing quite exactly like it has really existed before. So how do you think about pricing risk and measuring kind of like default risk and CDPs and that sort of stuff? People have some answers, but nobody really knows everything yet.
01:01:53.780 - 01:01:57.124, Speaker F: Even if you forget cryptocurrency, just think.
01:01:57.162 - 01:02:36.652, Speaker D: About for us as a marketplace, we just launched in Canada about five weeks ago. Just the fact now that we have to worry about the currency conversion from US to Canadian adds some stability or some uncertainty and risk just that is a big deal. Now you add all cryptocurrency risks and contracts and validation on top of something like that, that grows exponentially. But at the same time, if you don't properly reduce the risk as atomic, eventually we're going to get much better. You guys are competing.
01:02:36.816 - 01:03:04.690, Speaker F: DeFi is challenging the heavyweight champion in history, which is finance. It's got the deepest pockets. It's not going to roll over without any kind of fight. I feel like to me, the way that I look at the space is that timing is everything. Timing is the difference between executing and not executing. Do you guys think that the window is finite to this opportunity to sort of dethrone traditional finance and move into open?
01:03:08.120 - 01:03:57.750, Speaker E: Good question. I think the biggest factor in the timing for DeFi and adoption of DeFi is really just is the technology there? And it is, I feel like it is at least Ethereum 1.0 is giving us the tools we need to realize the potential of open finance. And it's amazing. The potential is insane. We still probably need a decade of R and D just to scale up blockchains and to allow open finance to serve billions of people. But it feels like now is the time because the technology is starting to get there.
01:04:00.300 - 01:04:33.860, Speaker D: I would say it's definitely finite from the point of view that it's going to happen. Somebody's going to build these standard tools and everybody and a lot of people are working on it. Whoever is working on this now makes it be the standards, whatever they are, zero X or some other protocol or all the tools. It is the future. I have no doubt that it's going to happen. And the reason why it's financed, because somebody's not bringing standards, it's going to happen. So whoever's working it has to make sure that they become those standards.
01:04:34.200 - 01:05:32.628, Speaker F: Yeah, there's sort of a fine line between standardizing things through collaboration and sort of aligning together and then also balancing that with systemic risk. And I know we were talking about risk before and so if we look at make it out, hands up for the audience, anyone familiar with make it out nice. So make it hours. For those on the stream that aren't familiar with it or anything like that, make it hours responsible for creating Dai dai, which is this stable coin. It's a decentralized stablecoin that is backed by, currently backed by ethereum. And that means if you put your ethereum down, you can draw down against that with a smart contract ensuring that you will make coal or be penalized otherwise. So megadao is constructed of many different parts and finance is always markets.
01:05:32.628 - 01:05:47.420, Speaker F: It's always going to be two sided lending, borrowing is this shift from single collateral die into multicolateral die. Does that keep anyone up at night specifically?
01:05:48.480 - 01:06:47.500, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's interesting because they're basically going to be adding more and more collateral types, and there's certain collateral types that it might actually be quite dangerous to add. And so I've seen people on Twitter, people who work at Maker talking about, talking seriously about the concept of like, well, you could use a mortgage, use your home as collateral. And it's like people have forgotten the past decade. Remember 2008? There are problems with doing those sorts of things. And it's kind of a classic tale of like the clarity of hedge funds prior to 20 08 20 06 20 07 there are these Argentinian farmland hedge funds, and they had monthly and quarterly subscriptions and redemptions. And after eight, the prices collapsed and these hedge funds didn't end up paying back their investors until like 6789 years later. And so there's this concept of, like, liquidity is not necessarily always there.
01:06:47.500 - 01:07:09.668, Speaker C: And just because the market is liquid today doesn't mean that same market is going to be liquid tomorrow. And so I think that's something that is really under talked about in the community and should be taken a lot more seriously. Because just because we've had a ten year long bull market so far doesn't mean that we're going to have one the next decade. And in fact, I would actually bet on the opposite. I bet we have a bear market.
01:07:09.754 - 01:07:17.208, Speaker F: In the next two years. What does a bear market do for DeFi in a traditional finance bear market?
01:07:17.374 - 01:07:50.450, Speaker C: I think it's good for DeFi because whenever people are dissatisfied with the traditional financial system, that's generally the thing that will lead more people, I think, to adopt DeFi. And we haven't really had that since Bitcoin was created during a financial bear market. And some argue it's impossible to know. Some argue that's kind of spark that led Satoshi to launch it. And if that happens again, well, it's bad for the average person, but I think it would lead to positive things with the adoption of this tech, and then maybe next time around things can be better.
01:07:50.980 - 01:08:06.170, Speaker F: Just sort of like a two steps back, five steps forward sort of thing. Just on top of that, who gets the most value out of DeFi? And do we target them today?
01:08:07.660 - 01:09:04.332, Speaker E: I mean, I think the people get the value out of DeFi are the end users of financial products that are just basically getting taken advantage of by oligopolies that can charge massive fees, that can nickel and dime them. And so I mean, it's like asking who benefits from the Internet democratizing access to information. It's like anyone that believes information and knowledge should be free benefits from it. If you want to prevent people from being knowledgeable and educated and informed, then it's not good for you. And I think if we were to use that same analogy, it's like, I know who DeFi is bad for and I don't really care that it's bad for them. It's like these oligopolies that have an entrenched interest in keeping things the way they are.
01:09:04.466 - 01:09:46.170, Speaker F: The heavyweights we talked about earlier. Yeah. What about accessing? The people that haven't even heard of financial products? Do we get there? Do we get there in time? So the other side of the world, people that for an understanding, argentina, Egypt, wherever we are in the world that got really high inflation rates, they're used to sort of 0% interest rate on their money. That's actually going to be a bonus because they're going to lose 14 or 15% over the course of the year through their current local currency. How do we get to them to really add tangible value as fast as possible, you think? And do we get there in time.
01:09:47.580 - 01:09:49.284, Speaker E: Specifically like these countries?
01:09:49.412 - 01:10:05.310, Speaker F: Yeah, I think we've got the resources here to build really powerful products. How do we get sort of the infrastructure in the hands of those people that are going to capture the most value? They don't have Robinhood cash app or any revolutions to choose from. How do we get it?
01:10:06.340 - 01:10:10.930, Speaker E: A decade plus of R D is scaling blockchain technology we need.
01:10:13.460 - 01:10:13.968, Speaker D: Today.
01:10:14.054 - 01:11:12.390, Speaker E: Like we're probably going to see traction in blockchains for basically like toy use cases. Like Chris Dixon talks about, the most impactful products and technologies usually start out looking like toys. I imagine that's kind of what is going to happen with blockchain technology and DeFi is that we're going to serve these use cases that are kind of appealing to people that are educated and informed and understand the promise of the technology and that is going to allow us to continue scaling the technology and improving it and eventually reach mass adoption. But we're not going to be able to get there immediately. I think that would be pretty challenging unless you're like libra. If you're Facebook and you have billions of users, you can skip the toy space directly to mass adoption. But there are obviously some serious trade offs around that as well.
01:11:13.960 - 01:12:03.764, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say, again, very naive view of this is that if you look at the cash app or all these other apps that are on Robinhood, and there are many others that are starting to provide access to stocks and investments that weren't available to the masses, to everybody, and there's a lot of traction. What can be built on top of cryptocurrency and all the new technology that's coming is that anybody in the world is going to be able to have access to it. I don't know what's needed to get there. You're going that direction. An app like the Cash App has a very hard time in today's world getting out of the United States. We've been trying to bring it to Canada for forever, since I was like we worked on it here in Canada, in Kitchener, actually.
01:12:03.882 - 01:12:05.588, Speaker B: And it's very hard to work on.
01:12:05.594 - 01:12:22.040, Speaker D: A product that you cannot actually use it day by day. The reason for that is banks, traditional banks, and how hard they make it for financial institutions to do whatever they need to do because it's all centralized, control over.
01:12:22.190 - 01:12:29.740, Speaker F: And is that the regulators breathing down the bank's neck or is that the banks breathing down the regulator's neck?
01:12:32.640 - 01:12:35.470, Speaker E: First of all, every bank is different.
01:12:38.400 - 01:13:23.260, Speaker D: There isn't like a common protocol that you talk between all of them. You go to a different country, you're going to have to negotiate contracts with each institution there and then implement all of their protocols. Becomes a massive nightmare to go anywhere else. For a company like Square in general, it's very hard to expand to a new country for those reasons. Now, if banking was completely decentralized and anybody could build something, you build an application like the Cash app on top of a decentralized network and from day zero it's available to everybody on the board. So it's a matter of time for again, this thing needs to become mainstream first. But right away, as soon as it's mainstream in the US.
01:13:23.260 - 01:13:25.468, Speaker D: Anywhere else, it's available to everybody in.
01:13:25.474 - 01:13:57.530, Speaker F: The world, which is a huge yeah, I think that's actually interesting. So recently, cash app. They brought in sort of stocks into the app. And I've always thought that one of the really most exciting things when I look at Zerox is the idea to sort of provide a trade market or like a very open market where everyone can kind of build a Robin Hood out of the box, almost with people supplying these tokens. And Zero providing the conversation between traders. How do you think about that?
01:13:58.300 - 01:14:46.570, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, that would be amazing. So it might not be like serving the entire global population, but I still think the fact that people in many parts of the world can't access publicly traded Canadian companies or US. Companies, and oftentimes these big companies that are the best and most attractive investments, it's people that it's immigrants that are building these companies and running them and their family can't even own the shares. It's ridiculous. I think creating tokenizing things like stocks and stuff like that, and opening it up to a global population, it is actually like a really impactful use case.
01:14:46.940 - 01:14:52.570, Speaker D: Yeah, I love that and I can't wait for that to be a reality as well.
01:14:53.500 - 01:14:53.912, Speaker B: Yes.
01:14:53.966 - 01:15:12.784, Speaker D: From a public company point of view, for sure. I have family back. I'm from Brazil originally. I have family, their friends, they cannot buy stock, socialized companies, even if. They would want to work, they can. It's a very hard process. Now that would be really cool even for private companies.
01:15:12.784 - 01:15:38.520, Speaker D: When you look at how hard it is to even run a round of investments and how much money we spend on lawyers, and how much work it takes to basically sell shares of your company to a few investors. I can't wait for a world where it's all again, decentralized and tokenized and smart contracts and anybody can do it without all this overhead.
01:15:38.940 - 01:15:39.256, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:15:39.278 - 01:15:50.270, Speaker F: And a lot of people think about who's used Robinhood or who trades stocks in one of these sort of digital bank looking apps. Robin Hood revolver, whatever. Great.
01:15:52.960 - 01:15:54.110, Speaker D: Another from.
01:15:56.720 - 01:16:15.392, Speaker F: One. Simple trade wealth. Simple Trade. Great. Okay. And other people on the stream out there as well. What's really interesting to think about is I don't know how many people okay, so people using well, Simple Trade, how many of you have got stocks in Apple? Yep.
01:16:15.392 - 01:16:52.240, Speaker F: Okay, cool. How many of you went to a shareholder meeting? Sure. Okay, so one person. So if you think about that, what's really interesting is there's a big conversation about regulation and regulatory guidance and how do you collateralize ownership of the stock. The purpose is it doesn't matter, really. The fact is people aren't flying to go, hey, Tim Cook, I've got a problem with the Q Three earnings report released about iPad sales in Southeast Asia. People are going to get exposure.
01:16:52.240 - 01:17:17.400, Speaker F: And I think that conversation is really interesting to me when I look at Zero X. Do you guys think about that? Do you factor that into execution as well? So giving this sort of idea of everyone can have a stock exposed, like exposure to a stock, versus how do we play towards the regulation to adopt sort of the alternative, which is owning the underlying stock certificate.
01:17:21.180 - 01:18:10.840, Speaker E: There'S definitely two different paths and they're both viable. So creating compliant tokenized securities and playing by the rules is like it might be slower, but it could be better for the ecosystem in the long run. I don't know. I imagine just shareholders in some ways can be like a community or they can be users. So if you're a user of a product and you want to own a stake in that company that develops it, that could be appealing. I don't know how things end up if it's compliant tokenized securities or if it's prediction markets for synthetic Apple stock.
01:18:11.900 - 01:18:32.316, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one thing is about on this kind of like global use case of people wanting to buy assets that they can't get access to. It's a really tough market to get into because one is UX for this stuff hasn't improved enough yet. That's like one prerequisite. Second is like the tech and scalability as well, I already mentioned. And then three is like you're selling a product that hasn't existed.
01:18:32.348 - 01:18:33.372, Speaker B: So it's blue ocean.
01:18:33.436 - 01:19:16.328, Speaker C: It's hard to pitch a product where people don't have the conception of it. One example is this company in two companies in China, one's called butoo and the other one's called Tiger Rose. One of them was actually started by George Soro's old partner in the these companies. Each of them are worth about combined they're worth about 2 billion, $2 billion, which is actually small. When you think of how large the China market is and how large potential market is for Chinese nationals who want to buy Apple stock or Tesla stock or whatever. So that shows that they have Chinese partners who are really well connected and that shows how hard it is to sell these sorts of products. But I do think it could happen eventually as awareness builds.
01:19:16.328 - 01:19:45.720, Speaker C: And I think synthetic assets are an interesting approach because you don't have to deal with the underlying asset. You don't have to deal with what happens if the underlying asset gets frozen or something. And most people today aren't buying stocks for the dividends anyway and also most people aren't putting shareholder meetings either. So if you just want exposure, the synthetic version actually could be like a cheaper, more efficient market on blockchain kickstarter than actually dealing with the real physical stock.
01:19:46.860 - 01:20:02.510, Speaker F: Do you see that going to the private funds picking? Joey's, also the CIO of Pantera Capital, which is one of the first bitcoin funds, sort of really early mover in the space. Do you see that creeping into that space as well?
01:20:04.400 - 01:20:55.692, Speaker C: Not as much, just because that market hasn't really developed funds like tokenizing private funds mostly because there aren't really liquid venues to trade them yet. And then also if you're a good private fund, you don't need to waive capital from retail investors. And so there's kind of like this mismatch where the products that do exist aren't actually the highest quality products. I think if the regulations surrounding this were like ten times easier and it was super easy to do from a logistical standpoint, then it might take off and you see this of larger investment banks going more and more retail. You can envision eventually that investment managers would eventually go more and more retail too. Like in the 90s, if you ask somebody, do you think Goldman is going to launch a retail focused bank? They would have said Heck no, but here we are. Goldman has done just that.
01:20:55.692 - 01:21:04.930, Speaker C: And so you could eventually envision the same thing happening for institutional asset managers too. But it's going to be a very long road and not something that I forecast anytime soon.
01:21:07.370 - 01:21:24.940, Speaker F: What's changed the most over this year, your opinion at the start of the year to now, what was the most surprising thing? We're at November already, this feels like it's just going like month to be in crypto for all of you guys. What do you think is the biggest surprise moment for the year so far?
01:21:28.560 - 01:21:29.532, Speaker D: I don't know.
01:21:29.666 - 01:21:33.150, Speaker F: Honestly, that was surprising. That's my answer.
01:21:33.600 - 01:21:40.190, Speaker D: I'm not really following everything closely there's so much happening I would love to know the answer.
01:21:42.500 - 01:22:35.440, Speaker C: I'm surprised that the progress on Scalability solutions has progressed as well as it has. I was relatively bullish on it at the beginning of the year but it was one of those things where I was only like you. Know, 30% confident in it. And at this point, I think there's a ton of scalability solutions that are actually written up. Software exists, they're being tested on test networks, things like that. And as much of them that intend to ship over the next six months whether that's things like blocks, route DK roll ups, optimistic roll ups, plasma variants and a half dozen other things. And so I'm super excited for the Scalability landscape because I think by the end of next year it'll be possible to have relatively high throughput transactions and that would be relatively feasible.
01:22:38.280 - 01:23:21.520, Speaker E: Yeah, I think I agree. Actually. Probably the most surprising thing over the last year has been the pace of development in zero knowledge proofs and that entire area of technology because these concepts have existed for like 30 years. People have been working on this stuff and there are people that are building scalable side chains and stuff and they're running on testnet ethereum like today, which is pretty insane.
01:23:25.720 - 01:23:27.270, Speaker F: Any audience questions?
01:23:31.400 - 01:23:34.128, Speaker B: Hi there I have two related questions.
01:23:34.314 - 01:23:37.160, Speaker D: The first is a major criticism of.
01:23:37.230 - 01:23:45.300, Speaker B: DeFi is regulatory and that banks and traditional systems are forced to obey these rules that are pushed down by lawminators.
01:23:45.380 - 01:23:50.892, Speaker D: But DeFi circler we pass and we're able to iterate. So how would you respond to that?
01:23:50.946 - 01:23:55.644, Speaker B: Do you think we're bypassing the system by not working with these regulators or.
01:23:55.682 - 01:23:57.752, Speaker C: Being able to iterate fast because we're.
01:23:57.816 - 01:24:06.352, Speaker B: Taking additional risk and on the topic of risk part of my question is what do you see as or who do you see has been responsible for when things go wrong?
01:24:06.406 - 01:24:08.320, Speaker D: Someone gets fished, someone lose their private key?
01:24:08.390 - 01:24:16.230, Speaker B: Do you see this as a user risk like your sol? Do you see this as being a platform risk? And if so, how do you do that without centralizing layer two?
01:24:18.280 - 01:25:27.740, Speaker E: Yeah good question. So regulator I think the question of is DeFi going around the system and kind of breaking rules and moving fast so is the question is that happening or should it happen? Should it happen? I think it depends on your view of the system you're bypassing. So sometimes the systems that end up kind of forming, they make sense when the system is formed. But today, as technology progresses, the regulations and the kind of lane that has been put in front of us doesn't really make sense anymore. And so you can either work with regulators to convince them that it should change or you can just burn it down or you can just go right through it. And sometimes you just need to do that, honestly, in my opinion. But there are also very good regulations.
01:25:27.740 - 01:26:27.564, Speaker E: I think the ICO craze really demonstrated why investor protections exist and stuff like that. So it's definitely not an easy answer, but I think regulators acknowledge that, and regulators will say, like, yeah, laws are important, regulations are important, but we also don't want to get in the way of innovation, at least in the US. Some of the regulators have that position when it comes to whose fault is it if a user gets hacked or they lose their private key. The philosophy behind cryptocurrency in general is like, don't trust, verify, take kind of personal responsibility. The power behind cryptocurrency is the fact that you can take ownership of your own assets and you don't have to.
01:26:27.602 - 01:26:28.556, Speaker F: Rely on anyone else.
01:26:28.578 - 01:26:37.840, Speaker E: So I feel like it's important that we keep that philosophy of personal responsibility and self custody.
01:26:41.060 - 01:26:42.800, Speaker A: Other questions from the audience.
01:26:53.510 - 01:26:59.602, Speaker B: My question is for Auger question is, I listened to an episode on Face.
01:26:59.656 - 01:27:05.340, Speaker F: Layer podcast about Veil built on top of Auger, but.
01:27:07.920 - 01:27:09.260, Speaker B: Curious to know what.
01:27:09.330 - 01:27:09.950, Speaker F: Your.
01:27:19.380 - 01:27:26.470, Speaker B: I'm also just curious as to what you sure?
01:27:26.620 - 01:28:07.938, Speaker C: Yes, I think Bill is super interesting. I think they ended up kind of like pivoting and making a core deboger, which didn't quite make a lot of sense to me because I think it was like some of the benefits, it was kind of like the worst of both worlds. Like got the negatives of centralized prediction markets and the negatives of decentralized ones. So you didn't have a huge product differentiator there. So I think to me, like decentralized prediction markets, the most important things are that they remain global. So globally accessible at Base Protocol Layer, no limits on transactions. The idea is that if you're a winning better or a good trader, you shouldn't be limited because of that.
01:28:07.938 - 01:28:29.034, Speaker C: In traditional betting markets, it's the opposite. You get limited pretty much everywhere. If you start winning, you're betting $1,000 a match, it'll get cut down to 100 next week, maybe it's $10. I've seen people who started with when I said 100,000, they get down to a dollar 50. That's a big problem. And then last piece is fees. Fees aren't that important, but they're a good piece.
01:28:29.034 - 01:29:07.862, Speaker C: You look at like betfair traders on Betfair who are in the top 1% traders, they're charged 20% fees. In some cases, you can get charged up with 40% of your winning if you're in the top .1%. Now, that sounds like, well, that's a small population, but in reality those people are driving 60% to 70% fanfare volumes. So it's actually big money to apply volume. That's kind of how I think about market as far as people building on top of things like Auger, it kind of relates to his question over there as far as where's responsibility lies. I think if you're building something on top of Auger, you might say, hey, we'll take a little responsibility. If something goes wrong, will they be paying back for it.
01:29:07.862 - 01:29:25.050, Speaker C: But in exchange of that, we're going to charge a fee on top of the base protocol. You can have systems like that where you can add value for those certain things you can do in a centralized way that still brings through the benefits of the decentralized layer. So to me, those benefits are no limits and globally accessible.
01:29:29.070 - 01:29:31.660, Speaker A: Time for one last question. If there is.
01:29:36.580 - 01:29:45.096, Speaker E: The other question, the group, you have a situation in which.
01:29:45.278 - 01:29:48.772, Speaker B: Major governments start releasing their own cryptocurrency.
01:29:48.916 - 01:31:11.420, Speaker E: What do you think the impact will be on ethereum? Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, it could be a Bad Thing for the Cryptocurrency Space in general, people that Might be interested in the Technology because it's their only alternative to government currency, and Then they really realize the benefits of decentralization and like a non government alternative. Maybe we don't get as many of those people coming into the space because they're satisfied with a government issued digital currency. But yeah, government issued digital currencies could be like a pretty scary, pretty scary, in my opinion. It allows governments to have a complete kind of view into everything everyone is doing with their money. And having financial privacy, I think is something that everyone appreciates, whether you don't have to be doing bad things to want to keep your spending habits and net worth private.
01:31:12.000 - 01:31:12.812, Speaker B: So, I don't know.
01:31:12.866 - 01:31:16.720, Speaker E: I think it's kind of a scary trend.
01:31:19.060 - 01:31:57.390, Speaker F: I'm just going to answer this one as well. I think it's really scary as well. But I actually think that this is the biggest layout we could get as an ecosystem. If you think about the difficulty of convincing, educating and onboarding someone who's only got paper notes in their wallet versus someone that's a cash app and trying to get them to move from cash app into, let's say, makerdown, something like that, the friction point, I'd say it's a globally crowdsourced onboarding procedure. So thanks for the 3 billion users kind of thing.
01:32:00.920 - 01:32:13.450, Speaker D: I think it would go against the decentralized property of cryptocurrency. It would be validation for sure, but it would not work. So it would be good and not work for the government.
01:32:16.640 - 01:32:37.410, Speaker E: If we're going to have a government issued digital currency, if the government can have transparency into the citizens spending habits and finances, hopefully citizens will have much, much more transparency to government spending habits. So maybe that could be a good outcome of it.
01:32:39.740 - 01:32:52.632, Speaker A: Right. Well. Joey will. Marcelo. Michael. Thank you very much. And next up we have Peter Kialtica.
01:32:52.632 - 01:33:16.180, Speaker A: If you could come on up to the stage. Peter is going to be leading an introduction to web3. And Peter was the co founder and CTO of New Air. He was also the co founder and CTO of Prestige, but today he's the co founder and CEO of Horizon Blockchain Gaming. Welcome, Peter.
01:33:17.640 - 01:33:18.628, Speaker B: Thanks a lot, man.
01:33:18.714 - 01:33:57.552, Speaker F: Great time. I understand if you guys want to take the wash. Yeah. So it's an honor to be here with you guys. I'm the CEO of a blockchain gaming company, but I'm still the lead developer, actually one of the lead developers and our main space to explore. And I remember coming to Eastwaterloo for the first time two years ago, the first one, and actually Liam Horn from Alport, the guy who checked me in, it's pretty sweet. And now he asked me to speak here with you guys after spending two years working on a video game, which we'll show you.
01:33:57.552 - 01:34:49.460, Speaker F: So my team and I, which we're 22 of us now, we're very excited about exploring video game experiences and incentives in the Web Three era. So I'm here to tell you about my perspective, what Web Three means from a product perspective. So first focusing on kind of Web 1.0 really, which is kind of the idea around the connectivity of information. So it kind of looks like this back in the day, if you guys remember starting with Netscape downloading it, it was just incredible. Like tapping into this endless sea of information that's hyperlink kind of starting it's kind of interesting where it comes from. Like starting from Http, a transport protocol and resource unifier and locator to connect information and HTML, a document standard, all open standards, really, protocols.
01:34:49.460 - 01:35:39.060, Speaker F: And the browser, which really represents this World Wide Web kind of the vision of open and connected information to allow anyone to access publish into this network is something really that started us to be here and it definitely changed my life and probably spent 100,000 hours or something like that on it. And so when we think about Web 2.0, it's about the connectivity of applications, networks and people. And that's where we are today. And so what kind of occurred? Obviously, browsers became incredibly powerful. JavaScript in the browser essentially converged to the capabilities of what a desktop could do. To the extent that companies like Firefox or Mozilla, via Firefox, Chrome, Google, their browsers are like operating systems.
01:35:39.060 - 01:36:34.448, Speaker F: And in fact, even today when we talk about WebAssembly as kind of essentially a universal machine level language, people are even putting WebAssembly in the Linux kernel, which is just wild and on blockchains, of course, soon. And this essentially deepened the experience and allowed anyone to instantly access applications and software from anywhere, from any device for free, without in a sandbox, in a kind of a secure environment. And interestingly, this right here is Spotify, which is actually a web application and a brow browser. This is actually Chrome. I'm not sure if you guys know this. And so of course, there's also an emergence of networks, of social networks. The connectivity, more people came online, obviously like ecommerce was kind of fulfilled by usability and the collaboration across ecosystems like Clouds and APIs.
01:36:34.448 - 01:37:21.060, Speaker F: This is web 2.0. We kind of came to the point of the connectivity and information and the kind of emergence of applications in the wide global connectivity of individuals and people as groups. And now what I think about Web 3.0 is really the internet of value. And so it's kind of looking back to turning these applications and networks into economies and this is again my view and that I'm extremely excited about. And so what makes it possible is to create and participate in open and secure digital economies. So, for example, the simplest thing would be as a user of an application, you can actually generate value just by being a user, a valuable user.
01:37:21.060 - 01:38:06.204, Speaker F: And just like we do on mining, just like how Bitcoin and Ethereum started, just like we can mine and stake by helping secure the network, you ultimately get to earn the native token of that network. In this case, by offering my compute power, I can earn Ethereum, which is pretty sweet. And so another great example of kind of offering in a lot of ways it's kind of like value sharing. You produce value, you get value. And so in the Brave browser, which offers made by the ex Mozilla CEO, they have their essentially it's a privacy driven browser where you have access to the control as to how advertisers or people actually view your fingerprints online. You can opt in to choose to do that, then advertisers and publishers can target you. But you will actually earn Bat token.
01:38:06.204 - 01:38:27.736, Speaker F: As a result of that. You technically can take that Bat token, convert it for various different pairs of the market, such as Ethereum or Dai or whatever, which is liquid stuff. Maybe you'll sell it back to advertisers who want to be targeting other users, which is pretty cool. So surfing the web, you're earning value. That's simple. So I'm working on a game called SkyWeaver. This is what we've been doing for two years.
01:38:27.736 - 01:38:59.184, Speaker F: Really excited, looks like this. It's actually a web game. WebGL game. We built our own engine. So it's a one versus one multiplayer turn based strategy game, similar to Magic The Gathering, Pokemon, Upo, Hearthstone and so forth. It's available on seven different platforms windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, Android. So the idea of our game as targeting the Ethereum ecosystem is that we have 400 different types of collectible cards.
01:38:59.184 - 01:39:50.724, Speaker F: These cards are, ERC 1155 tokens, but forget the number, not really that important. More to the extent is that they're type of cryptocurrency token that exists in your wallet. So you're able to own them and you're able to trade them with one another, which is really cool. And it's funny. In the digital card game space, what is it, $2 billion market? They're actually not you might hear the terms TCG or CCG. They're all CCGs because they're just collectible card games in the digital space, there's really no one, not even Magic the Gathering, that lets you trade with your friends, which is really interesting and funny and because it has great implications to the economics. But there's also a really cool incentive by having the opportunity to own these items but also being able to kind of gamify them in the idea of generating value and acquiring value.
01:39:50.724 - 01:40:30.768, Speaker F: So as a user, as you're leveling up and you're climbing the rank the production of our assets in our economy, which is our card, our economic asset is the actual game card itself on a weekly basis. This is how we mint our assets. So the top players, every single week we mint a bunch of silver cards at random and we distribute them to people's wallets and that's the only way they get produced. You win the card, you put it in your wallet. And this is real on ring to be and we have good number of users and it's only growing and getting people love the game. Actually the guy who worked on the game is the guy who used to work on Magic Gathering. You can play it everywhere obviously.
01:40:30.768 - 01:41:22.496, Speaker F: So there's a fully integrated wallet. You can see you have some ether, we have some Arcadium coin, it's essentially a stable coin, a wrap die metatransaction capability, but you can see the reward kind of leaderboard here. I can actually go to my wallet and decide to send it to my friend if I want to. I can hit send and there it goes. Or I can actually go to the marketplace and the cards that I've won through the leaderboard in a free video game, I can there sell it on the open market for of whatever the market is accepting at the time in a really seamless experience. And that's kind of the point as to what I think we're all kind of obviously heading in terms of all of sudden a these increase for protocol design but just to be able to productize it kind of an end to end experience, to be able to deliver what I think is about value sharing, economy design and kind of open economy scenarios and so forth. Like I was saying.
01:41:22.496 - 01:42:00.110, Speaker F: So yeah, SkyWeaver free to play, play to earn, go to SkyWeaver. Net and give it a go if you'd like it's on the rink of your network. And I think that's generally my presentation. But the message I would leave everyone is just the idea of creating value and having the ability to earn value. Kind of the perspective that I think is very novel of what these technologies allow and it's really just the beginning for web3. There's so many vectors and use cases for it in this open commerce platform and really exploring the space. So really excited and thank you very much.
01:42:05.380 - 01:42:25.700, Speaker A: So next up, can I call Peter, Dan, John and Sean to the stage as well as Kartik. So I'm going to turn it over to Kartik Talwar who is the co founder of Global as well as the general partner at A Capital San Francisco.
01:42:27.610 - 01:42:59.060, Speaker D: Thanks Navil. So this is an excellent presentation as a general overview of web3. And I'll be doing a quick panel with all of us, just kind of covering some of the questions around what it means to transition to that world we already kind of heard from here and what Horizon Games is doing. So maybe starting with Dan, we'd love to learn or have the audience know who you are, what you do, and just in general, Web Three means to you.
01:42:59.750 - 01:43:00.498, Speaker F: Sure.
01:43:00.664 - 01:44:07.752, Speaker D: So my name is Dan Litzer, I'm an investor at IDEO Colab Ventures, which is a crypto blockchain focused, early stage VC fund from IDEO, which is this global design firm. So we tend to come at this from a very user centric perspective. And one of the big questions around Web Three has been around usability. And I think that some of the folks on stage have really been leading the way in terms of making these financial interactions online in these kind of mini economies that are being created, making them feel a lot more Web Two like. So I spent a lot of time looking around, playing it. I love SkyWeaver, played it a bunch and yeah, just really excited by how quickly this space is evolving. Well, I'm the CEO of Gordomatic and basically we solve the usability problems in Web Three by solving key management problems.
01:44:07.752 - 01:44:32.210, Speaker D: So you can log into a Web Three app like Normal with email or phone in a noncustodial key management architecture and yeah, basically alternative to MetaMask so users don't have to kind of drop off during Onboarding. Before that, I was proud to lead a Docker credit docker desktop which is used by millions of developers every month.
01:44:34.580 - 01:44:53.448, Speaker E: And I am Samson, I'm with Brave Software. Glad that we got that little plug at the beginning. Thank you so much. Of course, Brave is a privacy oriented browser. We focus not on just preserving the user privacy, the user sovereignty, but also on the sustainability of the Web. We've seen since 2016 forward, more than 600 million devices are blocking eyes and.
01:44:53.454 - 01:44:54.616, Speaker A: Trackers across the Web.
01:44:54.718 - 01:45:36.804, Speaker E: This is spectacular for making a safer, more private web as those trackers tend to leak your information liberally to various third parties without your consent. But there's also a sustainability issue there because when you're blocking all of these ads, you're not just hurting big companies, you're hurting the small people. As I mentioned, the people who are running tutorials on Solidity, the people who are building awesome new games if they were to run advertisements in those games. And so what Brave has done is we've actually set out to create a utility token that would allow you to transfer value back into this individual's wallets. And it's been working considerably well for us for a few years now. So looking forward to where this industry goes forward and what we talk about today.
01:45:37.002 - 01:45:37.412, Speaker B: Thanks.
01:45:37.466 - 01:46:08.492, Speaker D: So a lot of interesting researchers touched upon what I want to kind of say is let's start a discussion on this one. Topic about data. An interesting sort of consequence of moving to the Web Three world is that now you're moving the cost of managing the data and the ownership of it to the user. There's a lot of side effects of that. There's a lot of the good and bad of it. From kind of your perspective, just maybe starting with do you think that's a.
01:46:08.546 - 01:46:11.536, Speaker B: Good move or should users be in.
01:46:11.558 - 01:47:03.216, Speaker D: Charge of their own data and do they want that? What do you think about that from the point of view of your product? The point of view where the general sentiment is, should the average users care? I'm happy to give a first pass. I don't think any user cares about managing their own data. In fact, they don't want to manage their own data. What they want is privacy and the ability to control how that data is used. And so I think tools like Brave are really good for that, for putting the user back in control. But one of the, I think, big questions that everyone here has grappled with is how do you give users control without putting them in a position where they're going to screw up and lose their data? Nobody wants to lose their data even more than they don't want somebody else.
01:47:03.238 - 01:47:09.828, Speaker E: To misuse their data. Yeah, I'll piggyback off of that. I was not with you at the.
01:47:09.834 - 01:47:11.190, Speaker D: Beginning, but then I was.
01:47:12.280 - 01:47:22.196, Speaker E: I do think it's important that we, as the individuals building the software, building the solutions that we face, the scary bits of it. Users should not have to think about.
01:47:22.298 - 01:47:24.036, Speaker D: The blockchain, they should not have to.
01:47:24.058 - 01:47:54.320, Speaker E: Think about breaches and that type of stuff. They download our apps, they use our apps. They do so with an implicit trust that you're going to be doing things the proper way. The great thing about Brave and many other modern applications today is that we never have your data, never leaves your device, and we can't abuse or lose what we don't have. And so I think it's to your point, the goal is to make it easy for the user so that this stuff just happens by default and the users don't have the concerns that they would have had in years prior.
01:47:55.700 - 01:49:26.704, Speaker D: Yeah, the way I see it is, I think in order to move users to the Webster world, it needs to be a more pragmatic path where we provide something that is a familiar user experience to users of the Web Two world. So I think by solving some of the key management challenges, for example, leverage with things like IPFS to store user data, then you can kind of achieve this kind of experience without introducing new concepts to regular users. And yeah, essentially, I think it's a progressive disclosure, and as users get more context of what they want, they can slowly evolve into products that fulfill their requirements. So actually one thing to circle back to your. Original question, who pays for this? I think that's a big challenge. One of the amazing things about the advertising driven model of Web as we know it today has been that it's enabled access to services to billions of people in the world, people who would not be able to pay if Facebook started charging they could not pay for Google services. And so there is this flattening effect from advertising that I think is really powerful and has enabled wonderful things in the world.
01:49:26.704 - 01:50:20.896, Speaker D: I think the issue is that we've almost tipped too far and now we're in a place where the level of surveillance and loss of control of our data is a problem. But I think one of the things that I really don't want us to lose as we make this web3 transition is the idea that services need to find a way to remain free and accessible to everyone in the world, or else we've all entered in here idealistically. But we're going to end up creating a worse version of what we have today. That's a very interesting topic. Maybe one comment from Peter as you kind of design a game that's mostly powered on Web Three, what kind of psychological behavior changes does that require? Like, do you think that it adds more complications or different mindset now that everybody can value this thing or does.
01:50:20.918 - 01:50:21.952, Speaker B: That get abstracted away?
01:50:22.006 - 01:50:33.350, Speaker D: All we're doing is offering these features as things like you don't have to worry about data loss or you have to worry about leakage or your information being stolen, but nothing else changes on the outside.
01:50:33.960 - 01:51:17.120, Speaker F: Yeah, it's a great question. That's what gaming is a cool thing to explore. Just because there's an existing market around virtual items, they can be typically low value, so it's easier to kind of explore the design space in terms of obviously usability and kind of data access. It should be essentially indistinguishable from what is Web Two. Obviously that's why we've taken the perspective of offering a fully integrated solution in terms of data and ownership. Of course, it's very important to take a noncustodial decentralized approach for multiple reasons. I mean, even as an application developer or someone offering service, you don't want to take on the risk of actually losing someone's core assets.
01:51:17.120 - 01:51:52.952, Speaker F: Data is a big word. So there's so many kinds of data and people value data differently, I think. So if it's your assets which actually are related to a market that's a bit different in terms of gaming and why I think it's really cool. What's the incentive? There's kind of multiple reasons. Typically there's already virtual. People like virtual items because they like the utility to be able to play with them. There is actually a $32 billion market of virtual items for free video games.
01:51:52.952 - 01:53:02.630, Speaker F: People buy them because they want to play with them, they want to show them off and they like just the pleasure of collecting them. And I think what's really cool about adding the kind of the blockchain layer is there is speculative kind of excitement around knowing that this could be converted to something else, perhaps and I could refund it. Like in the digital download era, if I download something on my PS Four kind of better off going to EB games, at least I could swap it for another game. I think it's cool when you explore the design space of competitive games because you can actually distribute rewards in kind of a profit sharing kind of a model. That what both net expands the number of people who are participating in this and ODS extra medigap capabilities. And I think even way cooler than that is people like the cycle of people creating and then contributing the players, contributing content or the developers to the players and creating this very interesting virtuous cycle. And hopefully that answers your question to some extent, but it should be indistinguishable and secure and that's really hard to do for many.
01:53:04.600 - 01:53:07.812, Speaker D: Dan touched on that and maybe I'll ask that same thing as well.
01:53:07.866 - 01:53:08.470, Speaker C: But.
01:53:10.200 - 01:53:42.032, Speaker D: Does moving to this Web Three let us kind of explore different types of business models. And as you kind of pointed out, a lot of this is based on subsidy that lets you kind of trade off distribution versus sort of revenue or product focus. How do you think about what changes in terms of business models or niches or just how people operate businesses? Yeah, that's a great question. So what we've seen in this world today, the crypto world, the Web Three world, has been there have been two.
01:53:42.086 - 01:53:44.080, Speaker E: Business models that have worked so far.
01:53:44.230 - 01:54:08.056, Speaker D: One is exchanges where people are buying and selling tokens and the exchanges made a lot of money and the other has been selling a token, issuing tokens. And those are not great generalizable models, right? It's wonderful that there are some big businesses built that way, some big infrastructure built that way, but we do need.
01:54:08.078 - 01:54:08.776, Speaker F: To get beyond that.
01:54:08.798 - 01:55:22.544, Speaker D: And so I love the experiment that we're seeing like Peterson Verizon, where I don't know if you originate this term or somebody else did, it was like play to earn and kind of giving a way to enter into an economy through participation. So I think that's an interesting model and I'd love to see that get prooped out a little more. We're seeing a lot of variations now where people are building this financial stack. So for everyone who watched the DeFi panel before, I think a lot of the projects represented did launch their own token early, before they had a broadly used product. It may have been functional, but it wasn't in that broader market fit yet. And now we're starting to see more protocols like Compound, which is this money market protocol, uniswap, which is this exchange protocol that are launching and they don't have a token as their business model, but they may evolve into it or they may build another type of business model on top of that. And so I wish I could be like, here's the new Web Three business model.
01:55:22.544 - 01:55:41.990, Speaker D: I don't think we have that yet. But I love the speed of experimentation and the fact that we seem to, at least for now, have gotten past the phase of we're going to sell a token and people are going to use it and the value is going to go up. It's getting a lot more nuanced and sophisticated than that.
01:55:42.920 - 01:56:25.152, Speaker E: One of the things I think Peter mentioned earlier was the value that's created by participants in the system, not just the individuals that are up at the very top of it in our industry would be like the content creators, not just the journalists and so forth. And I think also to Dan's point earlier about advertising and the role that played in the web. I mean, advertising has been there since the beginning, since 95. We had double click was there in 1995. Net gravity was born in the apartment of John Danner and Tom Shields visiting. And so what I love to see is that we're starting to understand that value is produced in some nontraditional ways. We start to see value produced by individuals on Reddit, individuals on Twitter.
01:56:25.152 - 01:56:42.180, Speaker E: And what Brave is doing is we're actually taking some of the value that's put into the system from advertisers these traditional endpoints. We're able to circulate that through to the people that have created a lot of the value that haven't been given the appreciation they deserve for many years.
01:56:42.270 - 01:56:43.324, Speaker F: And so I love that we're actually.
01:56:43.362 - 01:56:51.020, Speaker E: Able to create a way for people to actually transfer value in these nontraditional formats as well, these nontraditional platforms.
01:56:51.840 - 01:57:44.412, Speaker D: Goodine. Yeah, I do see that Webstering enables a lot of new ways to generate value and share value. I do also see that the lines are starting to blur between Web Three and Web Two. I come from infrastructure background. I like building tools for developers and I see a lot of great technology being created just in the space that could be useful as infrastructure in even the Web Two world. So partly of that is like key Mansion or secret management that could be really useful for this kind of new local first application movement which preserves privacy. So I see a lot of applications in the traditional world as well.
01:57:44.412 - 01:58:10.452, Speaker D: So I do see that's a potential direction for many Web Three companies as well. So I actually want to take a hypothetical scenario where just the extreme of the opposite of what you just said. Now that you get the ability to, in a way, price every transaction anywhere from a click to an interaction, do you think that kind of converges how we think about Internet or how information should be free or not free?
01:58:10.506 - 01:58:11.908, Speaker B: Or does that mean we're just going.
01:58:11.914 - 01:58:18.724, Speaker D: To see a world where you have to pay money for accessing everything. And also in general, does that force.
01:58:18.772 - 01:58:20.808, Speaker B: More finance related things on the web?
01:58:20.974 - 01:58:22.312, Speaker D: How much do you worry about that?
01:58:22.366 - 01:58:23.032, Speaker C: Does that matter?
01:58:23.086 - 01:58:27.710, Speaker D: Do you care about this? Is that even a real concern for each of you?
01:58:29.680 - 01:59:25.468, Speaker F: I'll start I actually don't think you could even enforce that if you wanted to. Information you can duplicate, right? So that's kind of what just be on BitTorrent or something. But let's see how does it change the interactions? I think what ends up happening is by incentivizing more people, you get deeper and ever expanded, like richer content. And that's kind of what's the point. That's why I talked about web One and Two in the fact what open standards do versus closed systems. Because you guys may remember for the Netscape thing, remember like AOL online, like how awesome it looked actually, and it had all these amazing things, but it wasn't an open system. And how could you build a business on such a closed ecosystem? Even like the idea of doing business together? I think it offers for example, in our game we use Dai and Arcadium Coin, which is actually a stable currency we use as our base.
01:59:25.468 - 02:00:04.810, Speaker F: Kind of like think of it like Epic V Bucks, but that are decentralized and work across ecosystems. But we don't have a commercial agreement with Dai or banker Dow. We know of each other, but we never talked about working together. I just leveraged their technology. So I think the permissionless ability to do business together creates the right incentives to allow you to build these platforms. That creates exponential output in production of more interesting things and creates new opportunities to actually make an income. And finally, I would just also just think about something like Twitter, which we all use and we really enjoy.
02:00:04.810 - 02:00:34.870, Speaker F: You guys may have remembered the stories of when they released their APIs and started kept changing their opinion as to the guidelines as to what you could or could not do in web Three ecosystem. That's not really problem anymore because it's part of similar to web One. And the whole ethos, it encourages interoperability and building on top of it adds benefit to the layer underneath it as well. Creates more utility, essentially, which creates more value. That's what I think.
02:00:37.420 - 02:01:24.276, Speaker D: I think even if we get to the point where every packet of data is essentially monetized, if you have to pay for it, for someone to store it, deliver it, that's still going to get bundled. Like most people are not going to be paying per packet. There will always be somebody who will come provide some other higher margin service on top and they'll be willing to eat that cost in order to have your business on their higher margin product. So I don't think that's going away. That's not going to happen. There's a great classic Nick Zabo post about mental accounting barriers to micro payments. And for people who aren't familiar micro payments generally are referring to sub $0.05
02:01:24.276 - 02:02:08.500, Speaker D: or sub $0.01 payments, which are just not possible with credit cards based on the fee models today. And so there are technologies that are being developed in the web, three space that allow for sub penny payments to actually be economically viable. And I think that will be used for certain infrastructure, but that generally won't get exposed at the consumer level. Yeah, top that. That would enable a lot of new ways for infrastructure to charge right. And something that's more fair that is based on actual usage of the infrastructure versus something like charging for active users a month you can now charge on activities.
02:02:08.500 - 02:03:00.680, Speaker D: But yeah, generally I think it's important for protocols to be open and really transparent to kind of build trust so that other companies can build on top of it. I do see potentially two models where the protocol layer can make money and then the application, the company, and the build on top of that makes money as well. In one case is Docker. Open source is really open. It's ran in a pretty transparent way, at least for the open source project. But as open source project, it has incentivization aligning issues. So I could potentially foresee that new open source models could adopt the blockchain in order to align incentives of all the participants.
02:03:01.580 - 02:03:02.040, Speaker F: Yeah.
02:03:02.110 - 02:03:58.490, Speaker E: With Brave, there is an invisible transfer value by default that the user is maybe not even aware of oftentimes. So the way the whole system works is advertiser. Dollars go in, they're converted into tokens, users browse the web, the browser keeps a private local summary of the sites you visit and how much time you spend on each one, including properties like YouTube channels, Twitter accounts, so forth. And then at the end of each month, there's value transferred out proportional to the amount of time you spent on those properties to those publishers themselves. And so I think there's going to be these emerging economies of just invisible value being transferred all the time. I'd hate to see stuff I think I mentioned before that content just being locked away, which behind Paywalls and more stuff where you have to manually and then forcefully exert the friction to get access to that. But so far I'm very optimistic that things will continue to be open.
02:03:58.490 - 02:04:02.988, Speaker E: If there is necessity for value to be transferred, it's going to continue to.
02:04:02.994 - 02:04:50.916, Speaker D: Do it in a friction free and pretty fool of. That why I mentioned the mental accounting barriers for micropayments. I think there's actually ways that we can use human psychology to enable new models. And so I love what Brave does in terms of letting you set your monthly budget that you're going to contribute to the websites you visit and then it automatically splits your payment proportionally across those sites. I think that's great, even when it's not mandatory, when you can get people to opt in. And I think of it as a very interesting parallel. There's a company in the energy space called Opower, and their big thing is they've created these amazing bills that customers receive.
02:04:50.916 - 02:05:40.868, Speaker D: The utility companies work with them, and it basically tells you how you're doing when conserving energy relative to your neighbors, relative to the low energy users in your neighborhood. And it kind of gets the sense of competition going or social obligation going. And it's been incredibly effective at getting people to use less energy. And I think similar tactics can be applied where, even if payment isn't mandatory, that people want to be good citizens, and we can kind of shape the experience and make a great default experience to encourage them to pay even when they strictly don't have. Right. We've seen different artists and filmmakers do these pay what you can models and make actually a lot of money off it. I think this will be something that we'll see more and more commonly.
02:05:40.964 - 02:05:49.276, Speaker E: I think one of the things we're realizing is that there has always been a demographic out there that has wanted to support content creators. They've wanted to pay, but to have.
02:05:49.298 - 02:05:50.476, Speaker F: To get your wallet out, to get.
02:05:50.498 - 02:06:21.880, Speaker E: Your credit card out, to put that into someone else's system, to not have any idea where or how it's being stored, and then to eventually find out someday in the future that you've been puned, no one wants to do that. It's not very popular. Plus you don't want to manage multiple different platforms. You got to have your patreon account and all the other competitors and stuff, depending on who the creator supports. And so I think we're seeing yeah, people just love the idea of supporting content creators. They want to they just need a lower friction barrier to entry.
02:06:22.780 - 02:06:47.650, Speaker D: That makes a lot of sense. And I guess kind of with that, apart from just the obvious UX and key management issues, what do you think the biggest barriers are, technical or otherwise, that prevents people or prevents web3 from going to Billy, to the users? Like anything you fear that could be a big hurdle. Other than those two things.
02:06:50.180 - 02:06:50.752, Speaker B: I think.
02:06:50.806 - 02:06:53.740, Speaker D: It'S definitely the divide.
02:06:53.820 - 02:06:54.064, Speaker B: Right?
02:06:54.102 - 02:07:28.540, Speaker D: So there's like this invisible line between web two and web3 that kind of inhibits us finding what actually bridges these two worlds. We did a user research for our interface, and we realized that a lot of mainstream users are familiar with Bitcoin, but in terms of east DeFi all these new concepts is very foreign to them.
02:07:28.610 - 02:07:29.230, Speaker B: And.
02:07:31.200 - 02:07:41.792, Speaker D: If we put BTC on the interface, people will understand it. If we put ETH, they're like, what is that like? Definitely.
02:07:41.926 - 02:07:42.770, Speaker B: I think.
02:07:44.740 - 02:08:54.376, Speaker D: We should be kind of consolidating digital currency as a whole, as a general concept, because taking out your credit card and all that is such a jarring experience. It would be great if you have a balance somewhere that goes around. But I think the consolidation of this cryptocurrency, especially maybe to Bitcoin, maybe something else would really benefit adoption because users are already familiar with digital currency concept because they use Venmo and Square and all. I'm seeing one thing, you mentioned digital currency and it's been coming up more and more recently. I started really hate the term because the dollar is digital today, largely speaking, right? And cryptocurrency is scary. People have really negative associations. A term that I've been playing around with kind of like is like internet native money, right? It's not native to any nation state, it's not native to any particular company.
02:08:54.376 - 02:09:12.376, Speaker D: It's just internet money or internet native money. I think maybe that captures the ethos that we're going for here and really divides it also from some of these potential national issued digital crypto style currencies.
02:09:12.568 - 02:09:14.616, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it was Mark Andreessen.
02:09:14.648 - 02:09:56.376, Speaker E: Who said it was one of the web's original sins that we didn't have some type of currency or value system built in. But then again, they faced many challenges in the 90s with exporting software, with stronger cryptography, so forth. But one of the other things that I think that is a barrier to better adoption is we have this far better model. I think Ethereum basically all these blockchain projects are so much better when it comes to trust. But the thing they don't really help with is user comfort. So if I lose, if I send 100 Ethereum to the wrong address, it's just gone. It's not retrievable.
02:09:56.376 - 02:10:23.510, Speaker E: However, if someone takes my Visa card from my wallet or gets my address or my number or something like that and they use it, then I can recover those funds. Usually the bank is there to help me with that. And so there are people that are starting to think about those types of problems as well because it's kept some people from wanting to get into this industry because there's not that trust in their side, that reliance that the system is going to protect them. And so I think that's going to help considerably as well when those problems begin to be solved more in the future.
02:10:24.520 - 02:11:30.804, Speaker F: Yeah, so I think the only thing separating us between realizing on web3 and now is just time. And honestly, I think in terms of usability in UX, we know it's all there. I think whether it's metatransactions or wallets, two factors, smart contract wallets that are being developed, handling kind of bank recovery systems and acting in that way. I think there's all the people, we just need more events, more East Global events, to be honest, to bring people together to educate developers and to more development tools to actually simplify and bring people onto the system and educating kind of the use cases that are novel, that really make sense. And like all things in technology, it's a bit of like pattern discovery and how do you apply these things through a common thread and then making them easy to use and then offering those benefits at scale. And what's cool about that's, what's great about open systems is you get the exponential scale because of the interoperability and even more so because of the lack of kind of risk in terms of collaboration. You actually can enable mass collaboration.
02:11:30.804 - 02:11:51.664, Speaker F: So I think we just need time, honestly. And it's not scalability. It's not a thing that's getting solved by a number of individuals. Not even ETH two, even one ETH one. It's not the wallet. There's like five great smart contract platforms. I think the one where we'll kind of land on, ultimately that will hold teeth back.
02:11:51.664 - 02:12:06.630, Speaker F: And I think there'll be great infrastructure companies that come out, of course, is security. Right? Managing these economies and managing these assets and regulatory issues is definitely a thing. Money laundering is a concern, all of these sort of things. But I don't think we're far away.
02:12:07.400 - 02:12:15.688, Speaker D: That'S great to wrap up. What is one fun or interesting Web Three thing you played with recently that.
02:12:15.694 - 02:12:17.690, Speaker B: You think the people in the audience should check out.
02:12:20.570 - 02:12:22.360, Speaker D: Other than your own game?
02:12:23.450 - 02:12:25.030, Speaker E: It's a brave browser.
02:12:28.410 - 02:13:01.620, Speaker F: I love ethers. JS of course, the Nomic Labs guys are doing beautiful work on development tools. I'm obviously a major fan of the roll up work that's happening in layer two. Obviously, the stational work that the stational team is doing is amazing and kind of bringing that together across a group of people. And I really think smart contract wallets are absolutely crucial. They offer a lot of important usability improvements with security. So that's me so far.
02:13:03.800 - 02:13:43.356, Speaker D: Yeah. On the technical side, I'm really excited about a lot of the metatransaction l Two stuff that's happening from a consumer perspective and I'm going to disclose do have a relationship here. So this is not entirely unbiased, but there's a really cool company protocol called Pool Together, where they've got this gamified savings. So you're depositing Dai, this kind of digital dollar, and it's going into compound, which is money market protocol. But every week all the interest is being collected together and one person randomly wins that. And anybody can withdraw their principal at any time. But it kind of gamifies savings.
02:13:43.356 - 02:14:13.352, Speaker D: And this has been done before. A number of different countries have done it. It's been different pilot programs. And what it generally tends to do is it gets people who are in almost like gambling or lottery playing mindset, and it converts that into a saving behavior. So their principle is protected and it starts to build new behaviors. And we can do this now at global scale. That's building off multiple primitives that have been created in this space.
02:14:13.406 - 02:14:13.576, Speaker B: Right.
02:14:13.598 - 02:14:59.032, Speaker D: It's building up the maker system, which enables Dai, the stablecoin, it's building off compound, which enables this borrowing and lending protocol. So I think it's really cool. It's been very compelling for people who haven't tried any kind of crypto or Web Three apps yet. Yeah, for me, I've been generally interested in DApps that helps users earn cryptocurrency. That's basically one of the best ways to get adoption is to just pay people with it. One DAP is called Sent. So essentially it's a decentralized social network and you can post all these nice posts and then you can seed or stake on the post.
02:14:59.032 - 02:15:38.790, Speaker D: And if the post actually takes off the original poster and the early seeders get to earn cryptocurrency and one of the users actually made enough to buy a bike for his daughter. And when I saw that, it was like, whoa. You're actually by earning crypto, you're impacting other people's lives. And on top of that, given all of this digital nomad like globalization, global workforce, self sovereign workers, trend, I'm really into a project called Opolis. So basically they would help.
02:15:40.600 - 02:15:41.344, Speaker B: These digital.
02:15:41.392 - 02:16:14.720, Speaker D: Nomads get paid in cryptocurrency and they'll make sure that it's really compliant. They do all the hard work to do that. And the last one I've been pretty obsessed with are kind of new token and funding models. One is called a Continuous organization. It's really cool way to use funding curves to guarantee liquidity and you can automatically market with a smart contract. It's very enticing potentially to investors.
02:16:15.060 - 02:16:15.376, Speaker B: Yeah.
02:16:15.398 - 02:16:22.896, Speaker E: I want to piggyback off what Sean said as well, the joy in seeing people earn their first tokens. It used to be the case, you'd have to mine it and that takes.
02:16:22.998 - 02:16:25.796, Speaker F: Considerable technical know how then people would.
02:16:25.818 - 02:16:38.672, Speaker E: Be able to buy them. But so many people are just earning their first tokens these days. It's super exciting. Especially Brave is obviously very biased, but this is also a genuine answer. It is one of the most exciting.
02:16:38.736 - 02:16:40.456, Speaker F: Applications of the technology that I've seen.
02:16:40.478 - 02:16:41.640, Speaker E: In such a long time.
02:16:41.790 - 02:16:42.936, Speaker F: I spend a lot of time on.
02:16:42.958 - 02:17:08.000, Speaker E: Twitter, part of my job, fortunately. And so I get to see people elated every month when they receive their payouts for participating in Raymads without having to divulge any of their private information to anybody whatsoever. It's so neat to see waves and waves of normal, everyday people coming into this industry in such a low friction manner. And so it has been an absolute joy.
02:17:10.340 - 02:17:11.008, Speaker A: Thank you.
02:17:11.094 - 02:17:11.440, Speaker B: Awesome.
02:17:11.510 - 02:17:49.004, Speaker A: If we can join a round of applause for the speakers. Lastly, just before giving you a chance to speak to the speakers, I have three short announcements.
