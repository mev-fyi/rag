00:00:00.490 - 00:00:04.160, Speaker A: Add your name to the bottom of the list if you haven't already. And your project.
00:00:05.490 - 00:00:06.480, Speaker B: What else?
00:00:11.030 - 00:00:28.060, Speaker A: I guess bold your name if it's already there. So we know you're here. Looks like we don't have a ton of people, so we're not super pressed for time, but still, we want to make sure that we get to everybody. How's it look, Andrew? We're good. Cool.
00:00:34.510 - 00:00:35.500, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:00:37.470 - 00:00:48.798, Speaker A: The only person I see here that's on this list is Tarun. Yeah.
00:00:48.964 - 00:00:49.438, Speaker B: Hi.
00:00:49.524 - 00:00:50.480, Speaker A: How's it going?
00:00:51.170 - 00:00:51.738, Speaker C: All good.
00:00:51.764 - 00:00:52.500, Speaker B: All good?
00:00:54.230 - 00:00:58.194, Speaker A: Yeah. Team Parcel? Yeah.
00:00:58.232 - 00:00:59.060, Speaker D: Hey, guys.
00:01:00.790 - 00:01:01.906, Speaker C: Can we go?
00:01:02.088 - 00:01:04.822, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Yeah.
00:01:04.876 - 00:02:31.706, Speaker C: So as we got the previous feedback regarding integrating aragon and seeing what components of aragon we could integrate, so we did have a look, and it's really great that we could possibly integrate a lot of components from there because they're essentially making Dows and they had multisig components as well. But the problem lies in the fact that it consumes a lot of gas, because I tried to deploy and play with aragon, and it cost 7 million gas for deploying a Dow or an organization. So I think that's a big concentration that we had to take. Apart from that, I think what they're doing is they're essentially storing a lot of information on smart contracts, and that's one thing that we want to avoid and store everything on IPFS and just make generic functions on smart contracts that could possibly save a lot of gas for the users and us. Yeah, so for that particular reason, we skipped aragon and tried to build our own contracts, and we have made the initial set of smart contracts already, so I think we're on the right path. So we finalized the architecture as well. So the architecture flow would look like this, where all the data is stored on IPFS, and we are creating a mapping of the index and the corresponding hash that we get from the IPFS.
00:02:31.706 - 00:03:15.546, Speaker C: So we're just storing when the user updates any kind of information on IPFS, we just update the mapping. And if you want to fetch the data, we fetch the data through that index. So we're creating, like, master files. So let's suppose if there's a file for pay slips, we don't store individual pay slips of employees. We just have a master file of pay slips and then have the nested data over there and store the index of that master file and then save it to the smart contract so that it's easier to manage all the information in one go. Yeah, so I think we're good with that. And we'll be building that during the weekend.
00:03:15.546 - 00:03:32.610, Speaker C: And also for the next week, we'll be integrating mass payouts so we're integrating the mass payout logic very soon. And also money streaming. Yeah, money streaming will also be integrating money streaming soon through Zapier. Just wanted to share the updates and get some feedback.
00:03:34.570 - 00:03:46.200, Speaker E: Very cool. Sounds like a really good direction. Do you have a demo that you can show us that's easy or no, totally fine. Nothing.
00:03:46.570 - 00:04:16.340, Speaker C: We just plan to showcase the demo today, but we just misunderstood. We thought the feedback is around 01:00 a.m. Night, so we just got to know in half an hour. We have the feedback by tonight. We made that deadline of bringing something. We're just making our milestones on this feedback call, so we're up for feedback at the right times, but I think we misunderstood the timings a little bit.
00:04:16.710 - 00:04:31.560, Speaker E: No worries at all. I was just curious if you happen because do you have any questions that we can help with? I mean, all of what you said sounds really good. All of that sounds like a good direction to me. Any questions that you have that we might be able to help with?
00:04:37.130 - 00:04:42.860, Speaker C: I think Fycon team already helped us a lot, like, deciding the architecture. So we are pretty much good.
00:04:44.510 - 00:04:45.260, Speaker A: Cool.
00:04:50.030 - 00:05:00.400, Speaker E: Sounds good. Yeah, sounds really promising. Looking forward to checking out the demo and playing around with it later.
00:05:01.330 - 00:05:36.300, Speaker A: Yeah, I think next week we're definitely going to be shifting into if you have a demo, please bring it and hopefully we communicate the feedback time a little bit better. If that was on our end, sorry. Yeah, we were just switching up the timing for people in different time zones. I know there's at least one other team that's trying to get in, so I'm just running around in the background trying to get them brahma. Did you want to share something about your project? Maybe demo a little bit? If you have a.
00:05:38.590 - 00:05:44.174, Speaker B: It? No, I don't have mean we have.
00:05:44.212 - 00:05:45.280, Speaker C: Something, but.
00:05:49.090 - 00:05:50.654, Speaker D: I can't demo that now.
00:05:50.772 - 00:05:56.174, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, if you're just here to listen, that's fine as well. I don't mean to put you on the spot.
00:05:56.302 - 00:05:57.074, Speaker B: That's okay.
00:05:57.192 - 00:06:05.810, Speaker A: It's all right. Looks like we had some new joiners. Yusef and James.
00:06:06.310 - 00:06:09.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Hey, guys, I'm Yusef.
00:06:09.610 - 00:06:11.782, Speaker A: Hey, how's it going, man? I'm good.
00:06:11.836 - 00:06:22.090, Speaker B: Thank you guys. Thank you so much for this opportunity and this amazing event. I love the hawk. FS, man. And you did some good job, man. Pretty neat.
00:06:22.990 - 00:06:25.306, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much.
00:06:25.488 - 00:06:35.520, Speaker B: Seeing you. Sorry I don't have a camera, but in this era, it's very good to see people and talking with other people and thank you so much.
00:06:36.050 - 00:06:41.342, Speaker A: Yeah, we're glad to be hosting the event as well. It's been amazing. So far, so good.
00:06:41.396 - 00:06:42.000, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:42.790 - 00:06:44.946, Speaker A: Do you want to share anything about what you're building?
00:06:45.128 - 00:07:28.606, Speaker B: So yeah, I'm working with two persons. One on their project, I joined their project, and another one I can't join because I can only join one project. So first one is we're trying different bounties from textile. So yesterday we did textile. We worked through all the Creeds and buckets. So we got main MVP, like car insurance app, which is a small car insurance app where you can put all the evidences and all the stuff there and we just got from Andrew access to Power Gauge. And that's good.
00:07:28.606 - 00:08:03.260, Speaker B: That's a good change. And next step, we'll try to do the installable domains, the chat app, which is a big bounty for the $4,000. That's a good one. Yeah, I think there is the other ones, like the tree box, she's a smaller, smaller one and other one I just don't remember. Click. Yeah. So we're trying to do three or four bounces, at least short time, but yeah, it's like crunch time.
00:08:03.260 - 00:08:27.506, Speaker B: It's like the deadline is very close. You can just keep going. But I'm loving textile. I'm telling you. I'm going to move from Firebase Firestore and use Textile because I think it's so good and it has the link with Filecoin and you have all of that. It's so smooth. And I think that's the future.
00:08:27.506 - 00:08:53.740, Speaker B: There is a good future for this. I love it. And for the other chains. So we are going to do the other ones ENS for sure, even a small one, Flick, which is pretty good, but I think they are going to split like $100.
00:08:54.830 - 00:09:01.420, Speaker A: Do you have any questions about trying to integrate all these things together? Yeah, just kind of heads down.
00:09:02.690 - 00:09:52.490, Speaker B: Sure. I have many questions for the Power gate, we just got access, but we want to leverage that and use it as much as we can use them. Like making some good features, even if we have a tight deadline. But that's good for the thing, I think, which is Protocol Lab bounties are pretty awesome. But I just literally have some questions because the top track prices there is like eight categories DeFi, Data Set, dev, choose, Video, and so on. So is it like something we have to make a small app for this bounty? Or do we make can we just make other apps for other bounties? And we have bounce.
00:09:55.170 - 00:10:10.770, Speaker E: We're going to consider the submissions kind of against the categories and we're going to pick the best that we see in each of those categories. In terms of you might be asking if you can submit multiple apps. I don't know about that, Trent.
00:10:11.190 - 00:10:48.586, Speaker F: I was going to respond. The way it's going to work for those categories is that when you go to submit your app in two weeks, you get to specify that you are eligible for one of these eight categories. Which means if you're working on an app that's about audio or large data sets or DeFi or video, you get to choose that. And if you do, then you'll be included as part of the list. And the Protocol Apps team will kind of get a list of all those categories and they'll pick the best project out of that. But it's not really a separate prize. It's just another thing you can win for being the best app or best submission for a given category.
00:10:48.778 - 00:11:05.880, Speaker B: Awesome. Sure. Yeah, sure. And for video, do you mean like we can make something like social video I don't know, social video app or something, or audio app using Filecoin or something like that.
00:11:07.850 - 00:11:33.082, Speaker F: It's very broadly defined, so the category is supposed to sort of imply that your submission or your hack is going to be dealing with that specific topic. So for video, like, you could have done, like, a video social network, or if you want to do a video streaming website, that also counts, if you wanted to do a website that processes large videos and you have a video editor that's also part of podcast, for example.
00:11:33.136 - 00:11:34.170, Speaker B: Podcasts.
00:11:35.170 - 00:11:50.210, Speaker F: Exactly. We can actually try to specify that and clarify that in the descriptions. But if you think that what your project is doing includes video processing or audio, then you're eligible for that category.
00:11:50.710 - 00:12:01.720, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. What about the 30K? Sorry? What's about the 30K? Wilder price.
00:12:04.170 - 00:12:15.798, Speaker F: So after judging happens for all the projects, the top teams will be sharing that price. So it's not a specific thing, it's just the best of all these submissions.
00:12:15.974 - 00:12:16.554, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:12:16.672 - 00:12:21.610, Speaker B: And what can we do to be, like, one of the top chosen?
00:12:23.090 - 00:12:51.014, Speaker F: The quick answer on that is you make a really awesome video that explains what you're doing and how it works with Filecoin or Ethereum or both and tell everybody why you decided to build this thing and how awesome your demo is. So RJ will be able to determine that, but it's really up to you to kind of make sure that the video you're going to submit for this really conveys the importance of this app and a really good demo that everybody can look at and understand what you're trying to do.
00:12:51.212 - 00:12:53.320, Speaker B: Awesome. Love it. Yeah.
00:12:54.570 - 00:12:55.880, Speaker E: Make the best project.
00:12:56.570 - 00:13:03.180, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I'm trying to amaze you here, so I'm just trying to get some tricks and tips here.
00:13:04.110 - 00:13:07.514, Speaker A: I think that's the best guidelines is make the best project.
00:13:07.712 - 00:13:27.890, Speaker B: Yeah. That's when you win everything that's very broad but quick. That's good. Awesome. Yeah. So I'll try to make something unique, and I'll try to do that. And for filecoin uploading, do we need to buy some filecoin tokens?
00:13:28.550 - 00:13:35.006, Speaker E: No, it's in the testnet. So you should be able to just it's just the testnet so you can get some Pycoin from the force.
00:13:35.118 - 00:13:35.780, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:37.050 - 00:13:37.462, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:13:37.516 - 00:13:45.110, Speaker F: So I think we got a few more people joining and submitted the form to feedback.
00:13:46.730 - 00:14:01.354, Speaker A: Yeah. Morgan, can you unmute or just it looks like the session might not go for the full time, so if you were planning to drop out and then jump back in, it might be better if you go now. Do you want to tell me what your limitations are? Yeah.
00:14:01.392 - 00:14:03.200, Speaker G: No, I'm here. I can speak.
00:14:04.530 - 00:14:11.922, Speaker A: Can you hear? Going to I was going to have Yao go next, but if you have some sort of time limitation, we can have you go first.
00:14:12.056 - 00:14:13.922, Speaker G: Oh, no, that's okay. Yeah, I can go.
00:14:14.056 - 00:14:17.300, Speaker A: Okay, take it away. Yeah.
00:14:22.310 - 00:15:01.040, Speaker D: Okay. Everyone can hear me, right? That's good. Yeah. Thank you guys. First time on this call effort, I don't know why I missed the first two one, but really excited to be here with you guys and finally feel a little bit more connected with you guys now that I can see the real face. So a little bit about our background and then I will also talk about this month what we are focusing on specifically for this project. So in the past six months we have a small team, three person building a decentralized online community platform.
00:15:01.040 - 00:16:14.290, Speaker D: So basically it's a decentralized forms. So if any of you owe enough to be in the 2000 or 1995, you remember the news groups, the NTP protocols, that kind of stuff. And we always think about why it doesn't last as long as the email protocol and there's a lot of reason because for people actually hosting the content, the ISP actually responsible for hosting the pornographies and the FBI called them and finally they have to shut it down and then become no more providers hosting those content. And then we become a web 1020 and now 30. I think that this is finally a moment for us to build something similar to 20 years ago, which is a lot of freedom, a lot of peer to peer spirit and that's what we build. So we build a very similar user interface as Facebook groups. However, the content we store, it is actually stored in IPFS.
00:16:14.290 - 00:17:53.190, Speaker D: So all the posts, all the community metadata are stored in IPFS, in Real. So we launched that product last month and then we are thinking about what we can do a little bit more for the crypto communities in general. And then we saw this hackathon and we decided to build an extensions not just for everflow, but also an extensions for other traditional community system like Whippleton or phpBB, those kind of old fashioned form system and empowering the community owners of those system and also everflow forms, obviously, to create their own branded token. To create their own, ERC 20 branded token easily. So we emphasize a lot on ease of use, good interface, just like Facebook Groups that allow people who doesn't really have any crypto background to actually create their own branded token. So not only for the creation, but also we help the commodity owners to define a lot of rules for them, to empower them, to define rules to how they wanted to reward their members. So basically we build a reward engine in a sense that commodity owners can define what the amount and when the user can receive that amount, when they do something, for example, if their discussion has which 100 response, then they can get some tokens from the community owners.
00:17:53.190 - 00:18:38.854, Speaker D: We figured that this is probably what we can do within one month, but in addition to that, we also support allowing communities to actually import existing any ERC 20 tokens to use for their communities. So for example, think about you are actually a crypto team. You wanted to create your own token, but also you wanted to use existing token that might be more appropriate for your community. So that's flexible as well. So this is what we thinking we can do in four weeks. And now I know that it's already on the third week. I think we are getting pretty close and we are able to have a demo by the end of the four weeks.
00:18:38.854 - 00:19:01.280, Speaker D: So we are pretty excited. And we wanted to have IPFS to be the back end of a decentralized forms. We wanted the token to be able to reward members and also can be used as a governance purpose. So people, you can select moderators by sticking your token, that kind of thing. So that's what we wanted to build.
00:19:04.930 - 00:19:05.678, Speaker F: That's awesome.
00:19:05.764 - 00:19:07.680, Speaker E: That's really cool. Sounds great.
00:19:08.210 - 00:19:12.580, Speaker F: Yeah, I guess. Where are you now with the progress you've made so far?
00:19:14.470 - 00:20:03.758, Speaker D: We finally had all the back end script and the smart contract done for the Yasi Train token creations. Obviously that are not a rocket science, everyone with the crypto background can do it. But what you need for us is actually build the front end that can connect to it and make it easier for form owners to understand and not only to create it, but also let them to define rules to drop the token to their members. So I think that's the fun part. And we did finish all the script, all the AirDrop script, all the smart contract creation script. I know that we are paying fifty cents per token creations on behalf of the form owners for now, but I guess that's okay. And I think we are pretty good progress.
00:20:03.758 - 00:20:11.490, Speaker D: I guess the back end is pretty much done, but more about perfecting the front end that is actually usable for owners.
00:20:14.250 - 00:20:37.846, Speaker F: And just so I understand, will this kind of work with existing forum software like I mean PHP PB you talked about? Are you planning on integrating that on just the token part and the payment side of this or for the community members? Or is it an alternative also to link here to one of these softwares?
00:20:38.038 - 00:21:38.462, Speaker D: Yes, initially, obviously when we're building the extensions, we would make it first to work with our own platform which is built on the IPFS, which makes sense because we are sort of focusing on the crypto communities. But the way we build it, the way we package it is it could become a plugin for the third party form systems. So in a sense that there's a plugin, it's pretty common on a lot of form system, so we would build similar plugin for them and we can repackage that. But I know there's a lot of technical hurdles and especially a lot of concern from the form owners about whether they have to download our apps to receive our token and that kind of stuff. So I don't think we have that kind of time within a month to handle all that stuff. But we wanted to create a reference implementation that works in our platform and it will be open source. Obviously.
00:21:38.462 - 00:21:47.540, Speaker D: We put it on the GitHub already. If you have access to it, you can take a look and hopefully we can repackage it so that it will work on a man different form system out there.
00:21:48.150 - 00:21:53.906, Speaker F: That's great. I just looked at the link of your website and I see the demo, it's pretty awesome.
00:21:54.088 - 00:22:15.482, Speaker A: Great. So you said that you can integrate previously existing ERC 20s. What does that look like? How do you connect in previously existing contract to your reward mechanisms? Obviously, if it already exists with mint and burn mechanisms, how do you actually handle that in your back end?
00:22:15.616 - 00:23:00.620, Speaker D: We don't actually handle that, we just give it a way for form owners to transfer attribute amount of token into our platform. Okay, so we become holding the tokens on behalf of the form owners and then whenever users receive the token they will get it in our platform as well. So there's no gas or no fee until they decided to move the token away from our platform to their own wallet. So that make it easier and low cost for people to transfer token within our platform. So there's some trust involved on that but it's also very flexible in a way that it doesn't really create any gas, any fee and super fast.
00:23:05.870 - 00:23:13.662, Speaker A: So you're effectively custodial just to avoid the headaches of these communities having to do key management and things like that.
00:23:13.716 - 00:23:47.900, Speaker D: Yeah, because we figure that they would never really, I mean, at least initially they would hesitate to manage their private keys. But we do have the option for them, for us to transfer the creation private key, the ownership back to them. So you will have a transfer feature that they can transfer it back to them, basically create a new one and maybe just burn old one. But the smart contract created by us will always have our ego for team signature to it so that we sort of can promote what we're doing, I guess.
00:23:49.710 - 00:23:58.234, Speaker A: Is this all on main chain or do you have any sort of off chain given that it's custodial it's off.
00:23:58.272 - 00:24:12.730, Speaker D: Chain actually right now it's just a simple database, not really safe to be honest with you. But we are getting there. Once we figure out the model that has a good balance between non crypto homeowners and non crypto.
00:24:12.890 - 00:25:03.060, Speaker A: Yeah. In the next few months I am pretty confident that there will be layer two side chains and roll ups that are coming online that can support this kind of high throughput social platform type things. Gaming should check out Matic matic, if you've heard of it. They're doing a lot of onboarding with games and different platforms like that that maybe would be a good fit. Yeah, because right now. If you're a custodial, you're not hosting the content, but you're in the same position as the reason that these forums in the 90s went down is because they're hosting illegal content. Do you see any parallel to you hosting value from people who are doing illegal activities? If this is all custodial okay.
00:25:05.590 - 00:25:08.580, Speaker D: Can you repeat your last question? Sorry, my son just entered the room.
00:25:09.110 - 00:25:26.566, Speaker A: No worries. I was just saying if it's custodial. Are you worried at all about hosting the funds for any forums or groups that are you're not holding the content necessarily, but you're holding funds for groups that might be doing something illegal? Right. Would you be filtering that at the.
00:25:26.748 - 00:26:05.410, Speaker D: Yeah, I hope that the ethium two can solve some of that issues. I mean, the reason that we hold it is just because at this early stage we want it to be as fast and as free as possible. So that's the only way to do it. Within the communities, however, we also have ability for people to transfer out. But I know that there's a limitation, but as soon as there is an appropriate framework or technology can allow us to not to do it, then we will definitely move.
00:26:05.480 - 00:26:16.410, Speaker A: I mean, it's definitely outside of the scope of this the next few weeks. Thanks for sharing concept and your site looks really good, so thank you. I'll be curious to poke around.
00:26:16.600 - 00:26:17.420, Speaker D: All right.
00:26:19.790 - 00:26:22.380, Speaker A: I think we could move on to Morgan if you're ready.
00:26:23.790 - 00:26:25.306, Speaker G: Yeah, I'm ready. Can you hear me?
00:26:25.408 - 00:26:26.570, Speaker A: A little quiet.
00:26:28.850 - 00:26:29.998, Speaker G: How about now?
00:26:30.164 - 00:26:32.480, Speaker A: A little better? Yeah, should be fine.
00:26:33.890 - 00:26:34.640, Speaker H: Okay.
00:26:36.530 - 00:26:40.960, Speaker G: So the project is called We Flow. Can you still hear me?
00:26:41.570 - 00:26:43.200, Speaker A: Yes. Okay.
00:26:45.990 - 00:28:59.790, Speaker G: The general concept is that looking at filecoin, I'm really impressed with the fact that you have this global, efficient data access where you can write and read in a very efficient way. And I think it's an interesting concept to try to model cognition for agents acting in their environment, whether they're moving around and need to access certain things, whether it's a car or a person or a robot or something like that. So my main goal with this project was to focus on the learning outcomes that might come with thinking about how data is written to in sort of a hierarchical way. So the pitch is that can you construct local environments to capture sort of massed forms of these data views that are kind of like more like engagement with brain computer interfaces? So, for example, if you think about a person moving around in an environment, a person in a very abstract form has sort of like an aura or a very simple waveform to them and that doesn't necessarily say who they are or what they look like or even the words that they have as sort of parts of their truth function. But it's sort of like an interesting view into that person and how they might interact with their environment and then you can kind of go down the resolution and dig deeper into, okay, well, that person with this waveform has sort of attributes or tokens or descriptors to them that might represent who they are. Then sort of adding another layer is like, okay, well, that person has sort of like a journal or words that describe them. So it's like thinking about a hierarchy of this type of data structure that might be put into filecoin through, let's say, something like the Powergate interface.
00:28:59.790 - 00:30:53.860, Speaker G: So, yeah, that's sort of the general concept. And then asking the question, it's like, well, why would we want this? Well, it could be an interesting social experiment as it relates to how do we iteratively test whether or not brain computer interfaces should be something that should be used in the future and working on models that are kind of like in between, let's say, physical environments versus digital environments because right now these two are very separate. We construct these video games that are completely virtual and people spend hours in them and then come back into the physical world. And then they might have, let's say, issues socially or something like that. So can we find this common ground between the physical world and the digital world that might be a better ramping function for possible brain computer interface modes? And I think that this type of data input could be an interesting aspect into aspects like ecological psychology or things like the way that people move around in certain environments, and it might play into aspects like longevity and mental health. Yeah, so that's sort of the general concept. I haven't actually implemented anything yet, but the focus was to think about the data structure that's behind it.
00:30:53.860 - 00:32:05.190, Speaker G: Possible that one might interact with, let's say, thinking about a group of people as a quote unquote state, and then thinking about their auras as like a network of interactions that you can view, if you wanted to, as an audience. And then finally thinking about the crypto layer would be, say, okay, well, if I'm a person that wants to interact with this environment or this sort of network of auras or hierarchy of data structure, I can pay to see sort of more resolution. So maybe if I'm looking at this environment of these auras of people, quote unquote, that might not give me a lot of context, but I might start picking up on patterns and say, oh, well, that's interesting. Like, I see this blue aura and this green aura interacting with each other. I can pay a subscription to see their sort of journal as a way to better interact with this social network.
00:32:08.810 - 00:32:22.426, Speaker A: Quick question. Sure. Yeah. So maybe I missed it at the beginning, but can you tell me how are you getting data into this? Have you spec that out or written anything about how data gets into what you're describing?
00:32:22.618 - 00:32:27.600, Speaker G: So you mean like the actual hardware device or something like that?
00:32:28.450 - 00:32:37.780, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, let's start there. Are you actually planning to experiment with an interface like that?
00:32:38.790 - 00:33:16.240, Speaker G: So I do have access to a simple interface that is brain computer interface. It's not the focus, but I do have access to one to input that into just a sort of web browser. And the next step would be to experiment with, let's say, more people in this concept. But yeah, it would be to use a brain computer interface that I would source from somebody else.
00:33:17.250 - 00:33:28.900, Speaker A: Okay, when you're submitting this in a few weeks, what would you say is your goal for the submission? What do you want to have framed out?
00:33:29.270 - 00:34:00.478, Speaker G: Yeah, so the main goal is to create a useful hierarchy for the interaction with the Filecoin Powergate project or just the Powergate interface. I think that would be useful, not just in this context, but in other contexts like BioHealth and other things like that, and then using that as sort.
00:34:00.484 - 00:34:01.520, Speaker E: Of like a.
00:34:04.690 - 00:34:49.130, Speaker G: I guess I'd describe it as what might a neuroeconomy look like in the future? If we're starting with these base data streams that are from brain computer interfaces into sort of more higher resolution social interactions that could be modeled in, let's say, a market of people that are interested in contributing to this global network. So I guess to answer your question about base case, it's like just sort of an input layer, a view layer, and then some sort of crypto subscription layer.
00:34:51.410 - 00:34:57.120, Speaker A: Is that like your end goal or something that you hope to get done in the ideal case?
00:34:59.410 - 00:35:24.246, Speaker G: Hope to get done in the next couple of weeks? The ideal case would be using this as sort of like how can we experiment with brain computer interfaces from what we have now, which are just external to the body and thinking about yeah, I guess okay.
00:35:24.348 - 00:35:37.146, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I was just curious. Juan or Kartik? I'll pass it over to you because I know I've been talking quite a bit. Any questions or I mean, I think.
00:35:37.168 - 00:36:38.638, Speaker F: That'S a super cool like I'm not sure what you mean by I don't know which specific BCI you're talking about because there's a couple, I guess public ones that have good APIs. Like, I used to have one called The Muse, but it's not really there yet, or at least the one I had wasn't there yet in that version to kind of fully let you do what you're trying to do. So I guess my biggest question here is how do you actually properly fingerprint a person if the goal is to kind of rely on those data waves, I assume or data waves here because seems like your kind of biggest one will be tying that identity. And then you can already acknowledge that. Because if you want to get two people or multiple people up in there, how do you know which party is the one behaving or kind of just acting? But I think it'll be super cool to kind of have something like this thing. I just think that's a super interesting idea, but I'd be more interested in understanding how would you think about the fingerprinting here?
00:36:38.804 - 00:37:45.254, Speaker G: Yeah. So the concept I would focus on is not necessarily about fingerprinting from, let's say, brainwaves. The device I have is purely just a single source of just an individual brain. That doesn't give you a unique signature at all. It's just more like, what is the frequency of I see the blood flow in a certain part. I think what this can turn more into is sort of a social network around mindfulness and people that are focused on being in these states that are not necessarily living together, but also living across the Internet. It's sort of like a yeah, that's sort of a second aspect that I don't necessarily want to I think right now that the focus is to kind of get a hello world out there that integrates things together.
00:37:45.254 - 00:38:15.502, Speaker G: That can explore the concept and then can build sort of like okay, well, it solves the problem of the input and processing and the output layer. A simple action could be just group meditation, and I think that could be a really powerful thing in sort of like New Age religion movements. But I don't think that this is like, who knows what could be used for super interesting.
00:38:15.556 - 00:38:24.740, Speaker F: So I guess maybe are there any specific things like we can help you with to kind of get the initial demo up and running?
00:38:28.950 - 00:39:03.040, Speaker G: I haven't actually played around with any of the code interfaces yet. To get a demo up and running. I was trying to reach out to a person to see if they wanted to join the team, but responding. I don't know if there's people that still don't have teams, I would be open to working with other people. That'd be one aspect. And I think I just need to spend a little bit more time focusing on sort of base case because I have sort of like a general abstract concept in my mind.
00:39:07.010 - 00:39:22.820, Speaker F: Never sure, Trent, we can just take a note and see if there's anyone else that is also still looking for another team member. But yeah, it would be great to kind of know what you end up with for the base case.
00:39:23.770 - 00:39:24.520, Speaker A: Sure.
00:39:26.010 - 00:39:31.560, Speaker G: Is there an additional feedback or in the next couple of days or so.
00:39:32.490 - 00:40:03.134, Speaker A: We'Ll be having a few more next week and yeah, we're planning to have at least two or three next week, but they'll be at the end of the week. Okay. Yeah, definitely. In between now and then, ask for feedback and drop things in the slack. That's where most of the hackers are hanging out, and I know that's where these global team and protocol labs are. So if you're looking for feedback there, that's where you want to put stuff.
00:40:03.252 - 00:40:17.478, Speaker G: Yeah, I put some writing out onto a GitHub that I could have shared for this, but I just thought I would just speak to what was top of mind that I thought might be important. But yeah, that might be useful. Thank you.
00:40:17.564 - 00:40:40.160, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Thanks for sharing. We're going to move on to let's see who else. We've got a couple other people here. Jin, you want to tell us what you're building, what you hope to have in a few weeks, and anything you need specific feedback on?
00:40:41.010 - 00:41:37.390, Speaker H: Yeah, let me just kind of get my notes open. So I'm doing DWeb VR, and essentially I'm thinking about how to make a social network more accessible for people to build in by providing templates and guides. And I'll just kind of screen share my notes here. So I did experiments back then with IPFS and ENS to make virtual worlds with. So I've got a good handle on the tech stack, like, I set up Hackerlab F a while ago. And this was my previous kind of experiment foray into building a decentralized virtual world in your browser. Wait for this to load.
00:41:37.390 - 00:41:46.206, Speaker H: But I'm kind of thinking about how to make this easier so can fork.
00:41:46.238 - 00:41:46.820, Speaker B: It.
00:41:49.590 - 00:42:38.622, Speaker H: So you get your kind of home space here and there's all sorts of gizmos and gadgets, a start page. So I'm thinking in terms of the Onboarding, it's going to start off like this, the 2D page that takes you then into the 3D page, and then there's different 3D pages. So instead of just this world, it can also be a crypto voxels world showcasing other experiments and stuff. And then that door or this garage door can take you out. I'm trying to build kind of like a sandbox so you can just start building stuff in there and saving it and then commit it to the branch. And maybe you can join up with other people. But I want to kind of limit the scope.
00:42:38.622 - 00:43:31.220, Speaker H: So what I was thinking of doing is starting off with onboarding, like making a really cool title screen that takes you into a 2D front start page. So I've got some inspiration of start pages. One I really like is Web desktops. These are desktops that look like these are websites that look like desktops. So I thought that was a really cool idea, especially because on IPFS roadmap 2020 goals, there's like, Web OS. And that was an interesting idea, like, okay, what if Web and OS kind of combine? But this was just like a simple front end concept. So I've got some ideas doing that with the CSS doc and all that, just kind of building that atmosphere of the virtual world.
00:43:31.220 - 00:44:00.800, Speaker H: But what is the virtual world and how do we get the web three people and the VR people kind of aligned together. So how do I make this kind of modular? So I was thinking maybe an expo. And so I've been looking at shell skiing booths and maybe these booths can represent one for every category. And what I've been doing in the background is just kind of building.
00:44:02.690 - 00:44:02.958, Speaker B: Kind.
00:44:02.964 - 00:44:07.946, Speaker H: Of a data vis of these categories. That's awesome ideas.
00:44:08.138 - 00:44:09.454, Speaker E: That's really cool.
00:44:09.652 - 00:44:19.380, Speaker H: Yeah. And I want to kind of create a memory palace so you can just kind of walk through the IPFS ecosystem like a video game.
00:44:20.070 - 00:44:21.220, Speaker E: That's so cool.
00:44:21.670 - 00:45:35.910, Speaker H: And you can spawn these in all sorts of places and then start to rearrange them. So those are wall nodes and I can make floor nodes over here and just keep kind of customizing them and they're fully functional. Like you can launch this in your web browser, the actual website just kind of seeing what is out there in terms of tech. Right? I was kind of thinking maybe I'll start there. Maybe everyone can have because it can be easy to decorate this, right? You just throw up a couple of image posters or maybe you can give a presentation. So at lab day they did this really nice way of formatting the archives and by recording presentations this way you could cut the videos separately and then spatialize them. So that was really easy to then make into kind of a hologram presenter.
00:45:35.910 - 00:45:43.120, Speaker H: I've got a demo here actually. Here's one with one.
00:45:46.930 - 00:45:49.120, Speaker E: Oh wow, that's in the archive. That's amazing.
00:45:49.570 - 00:45:50.638, Speaker F: That's amazing.
00:45:50.804 - 00:45:57.780, Speaker H: Yeah. I've been open sourcing the Internet Archive virtual world as well.
00:45:58.470 - 00:46:00.980, Speaker E: That's super cool. That's so cool.
00:46:01.590 - 00:46:02.340, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:46:03.830 - 00:47:10.170, Speaker H: So if I record presentations in this kind of template, you see I can key out the background and then put it behind a podium and boom, you've got like speakers. So that's kind of a cool way of doing VR spatializing kind of the talks. But also it opens up an environment for kind of more social gatherings. But we might not always have the same setup of good lighting and clear background. So how can I make that easier? So I've been messing with VTuber virtual YouTuber software for creating kind of green screen. So this is my VTuber over is I'll just show you my OBS template so I can record that same kind of setup over here in OBS. So if you want to protect your privacy or if you're lazy and don't want to get the right lighting and green screen is tough, you got to worry about shadows and wrinkles.
00:47:10.170 - 00:47:31.506, Speaker H: This is an easy way using open source software for recording a presentation as you can use any character. Honestly, I just chose this, but you can import an avatar file through here and I'll just load that up all.
00:47:31.648 - 00:47:32.340, Speaker B: It.
00:47:35.350 - 00:48:38.642, Speaker H: Here'S my chef for teaching 3D scanning in the future. So I was like, okay, maybe I'll make like a if I were to go with this idea, there can be expos and then there can be speakers. So I'm thinking and maybe the world is kind of modeled or inspired by Harry Potter worlds because why do you want to make a virtual classroom look like classroom it's VR, you know, make it magical, spatial. And I like it because in Harry Potter worlds they have small class sizes and big tall ceilings. It feels right and it's also pretty hype. So I'm thinking for my project Start page that takes you into a number of options. You can go into the expo world, you can check out schedule of events.
00:48:38.642 - 00:49:09.150, Speaker H: I want to kind of just have basically a front end. I'm probably going to change the NAV bar to look more like a launcher, like on Linux or Windows. You have the Start button or something. The CSS doc looks nice. I'm not sure about the background over here. I'll probably do something hack FS related, neon grid or something. But these icons will launch you into different experiences.
00:49:09.150 - 00:49:50.090, Speaker H: And some of them like the VR experience, one will be hosted on unstoppable domains, one will be ENS and IPFS and just kind of trying it all out and then throwing that all on the internets for everybody else to dig in and kind of part proposal, part project. Because it's like we can make something really epic together. Use it as like a gathering space online, do tours through the expo or build classrooms like proto school can have hologram teachers.
00:49:51.330 - 00:49:57.934, Speaker E: You could do workshops together, go take a workshop together and everybody being feeling similar.
00:49:58.132 - 00:50:28.060, Speaker H: Yeah, exactly. Because, I mean, physical events are hard to see them coming back with virtual events, you could get a lot of participation and you can archive them in this way and have whiteboards and just a way for us people. Outside of the DWeb community to explore what DWeb is about and for these minds to just cross pollinate and come up with ideas together.
00:50:30.030 - 00:50:55.150, Speaker E: This is really cool. Ton of really awesome ideas. Really love how all the different modalities that you're exploring. A lot of really awesome stuff, a couple of ideas as you're going through it. Having the old arcade style machines. I think it's really cool. And something you could do is you could take a library of a bunch of games like normal.
00:50:55.150 - 00:51:59.926, Speaker E: There's a ton of games out in the web, so you could take a bunch of them and import them, give them each their own website, they could be their own IPFS hash. Or you could actually give them a name with DNS or Domains or something. And then you could have like a whole arcade room and it'd be really awesome if you could do either at least streaming single player where if I go up to it and I start playing then somehow if you're next to me you can see what I'm seeing so you can see me playing the game. And so that would be kind of like streaming the canvas of my browser. Yeah, I don't know if you like there's probably a few different approaches to how to do that, but that would be kind of really awesome because then you can have people crowding around and seeing people play the same game, or you could have people playing the same game their own instance next to each other. And then you can see kind of like both screens and you can play single player games competitively. Now, the real kicker would be, could you do a multiplayer game that way? And that would be really awesome.
00:51:59.926 - 00:52:19.902, Speaker E: You could start throwing arcade parties right now where you could get everyone to those room, have a room full of different games, and then people can start playing multiplayer games with each other. This is really awesome. I really love all the concepts and really like the expo gallery. I think that's a really phenomenal way to explore an ecosystem and explore ideas and yeah, this is great.
00:52:20.036 - 00:53:37.394, Speaker H: That game within a game concept was the original inspiration for that hacker space where you could play like you and your friends can each have a full screen of any web game. I use Crypto Voxels in this example, but the game in a game where you can jump into this world and this can be completely decentralized. And you're playing in this I see the metaverse kind of in these layers you've got the local layer, which is like your desktop, and then you've got a social kind of peer to peer layer where it can be you and your friends in a neighborhood or something. And then there's this global layer where I think that's where the virtual economy is going to be. So this one kind of ties it together in a comfort mode setting where VR is much more comfortable if you're looking at a screen versus if you're in there in that blocky world and you can listen to your favorite music. And there's a little work area over here, too. So this is the kind of visualization when the garage door is closed, and when the garage door is open, it's kind of like that game elevator from GMod where it keeps opening up into different worlds.
00:53:37.394 - 00:53:43.990, Speaker H: Yeah, I want to make it very portable, which is why I contained it all within that shipping container.
00:53:46.410 - 00:53:53.900, Speaker E: Yeah, I love the modularity aspect, this whole idea that you can take that entire world and place it in different places and put a lot of them together. That's awesome.
00:53:54.830 - 00:54:07.440, Speaker H: Yeah, you can stack them up together, build like a campus. I've been looking at designs and maybe even using real shipping container models for it.
00:54:08.850 - 00:54:12.020, Speaker E: How hard is it for somebody to make their own room?
00:54:13.350 - 00:55:03.362, Speaker H: It's getting a lot easier. In the latest version, the drag and drop is getting I'll just kind of show you a video real quick. It's going to be drag and drop and I already open source a lot of these assets, including basically an empty version of this world. So I've got Gltfs and Voxel models as well. If you wanted to make something in Crypto Voxels. But this is a demonstration of how easy it'll be to customize. And then after drag and dropping the files, all you need to do is export the code.
00:55:03.362 - 00:55:40.678, Speaker H: It's writing the markup underneath it. So, yeah, this is basically building your own three D website, just even collaboratively. So it's using Janice web and so it's doing all these edits over the server as well. So you and a friend can customize the world and talk to each other. WebRTC for VoIP and video sharing. Screen sharing can come too as well. But yeah, just using drag and drop in your mouse wheel, 1234 for changing the scale.
00:55:40.678 - 00:56:12.194, Speaker H: And then you export the code. Or just save it all as a model and then import it to a blender or something to optimize because things like this helmet might be pretty high poly. I want to make it very easy. So I want to start out with some templates, like the environment and then the house. So I'm thinking about well, I don't know about the house. Maybe we'll start out with an expo.
00:56:12.242 - 00:56:12.950, Speaker A: Booth.
00:56:15.050 - 00:56:27.290, Speaker H: And then it can graduate to your own personal house. Just starting out with land building, graduate from there. Just keeping it all modular.
00:56:29.570 - 00:56:33.200, Speaker E: This is super cool. Yeah, this is awesome. I can't wait to play with it.
00:56:34.770 - 00:56:35.520, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:56:38.290 - 00:56:46.660, Speaker H: Yeah. I'll have a virtual instructor probably telling you how to do everything, so that's the goal is making this into.
00:56:50.150 - 00:56:50.466, Speaker A: A.
00:56:50.488 - 00:56:57.350, Speaker H: Website in which you learn how to make a on IPFS.
00:56:58.810 - 00:57:03.080, Speaker A: Awesome. That's a really cool demo. Glad you were able to walk us through it.
00:57:04.490 - 00:57:07.500, Speaker H: Yeah, glad you all like it.
00:57:12.590 - 00:57:44.502, Speaker A: Is there anybody else who wants to share what they've been working on or ask for feedback? Let's see, we've got a couple people who haven't spoken yet, sabo and James Fork, if you'd like to share. And Jay. But James, I know we haven't seen you in a few sessions, so if you can't, that's fine. Anyways, just put in the chat if you'd like stock. Jay, do you want to share what you're working on?
00:57:44.636 - 00:58:07.100, Speaker I: Yeah, I have a question for Juan. One of the things we're running into is storage space. Question is, do you have any idea what 40 petabytes of storage might cost when filecoin is live?
00:58:08.270 - 00:58:29.170, Speaker E: Not yet. We'll see what happens with the block reward and the incentives and all that kind of stuff. So we're still early days to be able to tell something like that. But it's worth noting the block reward of Falcon is going to subsidize a significant portion of that storage cost. So we'll see what happens. At the end of the day, it'll be a market competition.
00:58:30.230 - 00:58:34.162, Speaker I: Do you think that would be a problem, like 40 petabytes a day or.
00:58:34.216 - 00:58:35.874, Speaker B: 80 petabytes a day?
00:58:36.072 - 00:58:46.520, Speaker E: I'm not 100% sure, but my thought is that for clients, the expensive part will just be getting the data to the miners. 40 petabytes is a lot, so you have to ship it.
00:58:48.270 - 00:58:49.020, Speaker A: Okay.
00:58:51.630 - 00:59:36.100, Speaker I: That'S good to know. Cool. Well, I had a good chat with some of the Protocol Labs developers this morning about some dimensions of Lib P to P running on Raspberry Pi as a constellation of Raspberry PiS, and they gave me a relay direction to go in. We're working to stand up a D app that Carson Farmer demoed in a series of lessons, and we're looking at that as our front end. And, yeah, we're pretty pleased with how it's all coming together.
00:59:36.670 - 00:59:39.050, Speaker A: That's our update.
00:59:42.430 - 00:59:55.950, Speaker I: We were extremely heartened by the conversation last night about the future of decentralized social media. We saw a lot of common ground, so yeah, thanks.
00:59:56.020 - 01:00:18.790, Speaker A: That's it. Cool. I think that might be everybody, unless there are any final thoughts from Kartik or Juan. Definitely. Next week, we would love to see people breaking their demos. Come to the hackfeedback session. Show us some code.
01:00:18.790 - 01:00:39.742, Speaker A: Show us what you've got. Because before you know it, it's going to be time to submit, and we'd love to have at least two sessions where there's time for you to get feedback on what you've actually built. So we should have those times settled soon, and then they'll be up on the calendar for the next hack feedback sessions. Yeah.

I did some blender, little bit of 3D marks, and yeah, it just was amazing. I was having this idea of making a word like the 3D word, because Crypto Voxel one is like, just pixels, but this one is like, something innovative. Man, you did a good job.
