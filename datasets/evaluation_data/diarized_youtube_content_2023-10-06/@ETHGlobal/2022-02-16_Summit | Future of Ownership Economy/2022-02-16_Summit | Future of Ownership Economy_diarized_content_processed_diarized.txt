00:00:05.290 - 00:00:21.920, Speaker A: And next up, we have our last talk of the day, and for this, I want to introduce Spencer and Lee from Variant. And we're going to talk about the ownership and the passion economy. So without further ado, let's welcome Lee and Spencer on stage, and I'll let you turn on your videos. Hi.
00:00:22.690 - 00:00:26.486, Speaker B: Hey there. Nice to be here. Thanks, Karthik, for having us.
00:00:26.588 - 00:01:01.390, Speaker A: I'm excited to host to both of you, and I kind of have a handful of things planned for this. Largely it's just interesting because you are coworkers. Spencer and Lee are general partners at Variant Fund. And what I want to do is I want to see, I want to first give you an opportunity to just kind of talk about your background in terms of how you got to where you are now, especially kind of from both of your ends. You kind of have a different focus that each of you kind of are excited about. And I'm curious to kind of hear what sort of made you spend all of your time in crypto. And I've been perhaps maybe we can start with Spencer here and then we'll move on to Lee.
00:01:02.470 - 00:01:32.940, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, happy to. And thanks for having us. See, I guess my crypto journey begin a white paper and immediately just went down the rabbit hole, right. Didn't have really anyone to talk to about it. So I started Tweeting. And it was in 2014 where I started a bitcoin on Ramp company.
00:01:32.940 - 00:02:16.534, Speaker C: We were trying to make it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin in physical locations, and we had to shut that company down because of just a really uncertain regulatory environment. And I learned a lot during that time. It's funny to see how much the space has changed. Right. I think there's a lot more certainty as it relates to regulations today, but actually left the space during the bear market, I guess, officially, but then kind of came back. In 2018, I started a crypto fund, one of the early crypto funds called DTC Capital. And I was a solo GP there, managing a portfolio that invested in tokens as well as early stage companies.
00:02:16.534 - 00:03:07.554, Speaker C: And that's where I just fell in love with working with entrepreneurs, right, building these new companies and protocols from the ground up. And just like the ability that some of them had to truly transform the world, whether that's finance or consumer or social, it really doesn't matter. I think I just got really invigorated by doing that. And one of the insights that I had while at DTC Capital was how much community really mattered to the overall success of these projects. And having a really healthy community was something that I wrote a lot about just in terms of tactically. And someone else who was in the space and is Lee and myself's. Third co founder at variant is Jesse Walden.
00:03:07.554 - 00:03:53.862, Speaker C: And Jesse was writing about progressive decentralization when he was at andreessen Horowitz. And this is this idea, know you have a company and know you slowly exit to your community. So you can kind of see the parallels between those two idea spaces and yeah, Jesse and, you know, ended up investing a lot together. I worked at his crypto startup school initiative that he ran and highly encourage everyone to watch those videos. They're still on the Internet today. And then, yeah, I joined him in January of last year as kind of the second general partner at Variant. And so, yeah, I would say one of the big things that we do is we help our portfolio companies build their own communities, among other things.
00:03:53.862 - 00:04:35.870, Speaker C: And I manage my own community myself. It's called our network. Which shameless plug. I hope everyone here subscribes to the newsletter. It's ournetwork substac.com. And what it is, is an onchain analytics community that each week we feature four or five projects in the crypto space that are doing innovative things and contributors talk about them on a fundamental basis and use kind of on chain metrics to tell a story about their health. And I would say that everyone in the ownership economy and this is the fun thesis and we kind of get into it later with lee is an investor, right, in crypto.
00:04:35.870 - 00:04:48.550, Speaker C: And so I think by subscribing to the newsletter, you become a better, more data driven crypto investor, which is something that I think everyone needs and it's just something that I'm really passionate about. So, yeah, happy to kick it over to Lee.
00:04:50.010 - 00:05:30.102, Speaker B: Hey everyone, really good to be here. I'm Lee, I'm one of the other general partners and co founders at Variant Fund. So my story and how I got into crypto, well, it definitely was a little bit more belated than Spencer's story, but my background has been in consumer internet and consumer software for basically my entire career. I started my journey as a product manager. Initially in Silicon Valley, I was building a mobile app. This was during the wave of Somalo social mobile local apps that everyone was working on. Post app Store release, did that for a few years.
00:05:30.102 - 00:06:39.930, Speaker B: That company got acquired and then I went over to the investing side at Andreessen Horowitz to work on the consumer investing team. And what initially I intended to be a one or two year stint before I went back to the product side ended up being really something that I fell in love with and am still working on today, which is investing. So I have a long history and background as a consumer investor, specifically in traditional marketplaces, social networks, professional networks, any sort of network effects product. And it's that story that then segues into my journey into crypto, which is that the through line of all of the investments that I had been working on for all of those years at my time at Andreessen were really around using technology to improve access. Access to friends, access to other social connections, access to jobs and economic opportunity through being able to participate in a marketplace. And then I started investing in future of work consumer platforms through my own fund called Italier Ventures. In 2020 after I left a 16 Z.
00:06:39.930 - 00:07:49.010, Speaker B: And it was there that I began to explore crypto as a tool to help turbocharge that thesis of technology to improve access. So I began to invest in crypto projects that helped to enable people to pursue their passions and to earn from that and found myself spending more and more time there, becoming more interested in crypto as a means to distribute ownership of the underlying platforms themselves. And felt that that was really the strong form of my thesis of the passion economy, of how people are able to earn a living through leveraging these new tools. And so Jesse and I, who have been colleagues before at E 16 Z, decided that our two theses of the ownership economy and the passion economy were really two sides of the same coin and that we would be better as a team together collectively. And so I joined the team full time in October and now am focused a lot on the consumer side of crypto and really interested in new applications that can help accelerate mainstream adoption.
00:07:50.550 - 00:08:30.046, Speaker A: Thank you so much for that. This is awesome on a couple of fronts. One, because you just made my life a lot easier by just chatting at all the topics we're going to cover anyway and it flows naturally and everything else. So my kind of first question for you is Lee, is you already kind of said that passion and ownership economy are kind of two sides of the same coin. But are we talking about something brand new here or do you think this is just sort of like is this something that's just uniquely only enabled by web3 or crypto? Or was this kind of already happening in parts or pieces before and now it's just amplified how do you kind of think about then versus now sort of comparison here?
00:08:30.228 - 00:09:24.526, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So just to sort of level set variance, whole thesis is the ownership economy. So we are investing in platforms that aim to distribute ownership to their users and to their communities. And as to the question of is this new, is this something that is only possible through crypto, I think the answer is nuanced because I think the idea of user ownership and worker ownership has existed for hundreds of years. Cooperatives like worker owned co ops or consumer cooperatives, they've been around basically since the Industrial Revolution. They came to being from this desire for people to have more leverage, to gain economic power together and to improve their options. And so for about 200 years or so we've had worker owned co ops or consumer co ops.
00:09:24.526 - 00:10:33.110, Speaker B: Like some of the biggest companies that we encounter and purchase through are actually cooperatives like Rei. But I think that the strong form of the ownership economy thesis is really made possible through crypto. And that's because traditionally the way that you would enable worker ownership or user ownership is through traditional equity done through the traditional legal rails. You would grant all of your workers equity in a worker owned co op and that obviously entails more inefficiency in actually distributing that ownership and is subject to all of the limitations of equity from a regulatory perspective. As a result, crypto tokens, I think represents the strong form of enabling the ownership economy because all of a sudden you're able to distribute value through tokens over the Internet as easily as we're able to transmit information. And so it's not entirely a new thing to distribute ownership, but I think it's very much strongly enabled by crypto.
00:10:33.850 - 00:11:20.470, Speaker C: Yeah, and I would just maybe add that it's definitely accelerated through crypto. I think there's just an immense amount of leverage with smart contracts and what developers can do. Obviously one of the main products from a smart contract is a token, I would say. When you zoom out and think about how tokens are just superior to equity, they have some downsides. Let me just give you a rosy picture. They're basically free to deploy, right? It costs just basically the price to they're infinitely programmable, right? You could literally do whatever you want with them. They are accessible to anyone in the world.
00:11:20.470 - 00:11:59.490, Speaker C: It doesn't have to be just investors in the United States or somewhere else. It's truly global and they're liquid if you want them to be from day one. And I think that is a recipe for just sounds a Cambrian explosion, if you will, of new innovation in this space. And it's honestly amazing that we get to invest in these projects at the earliest, most formative stages a lot of the times with entrepreneurs who are honestly just starting off and maybe only have an idea. But I really think the big unlock is smart contracts and tokens.
00:12:00.230 - 00:12:52.994, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. I absolutely agree. And it's just one of those things where you have to kind of constantly switch between are we talking about the recipes or the outcomes and we have all the ingredients here for kind of coming with interesting items, but we haven't seen all possible combinations permutations of it just yet either. One kind of question I had for both of you and I'll kind of start with Spencer is that when we usually think about creator economy or kind of passion economy or ownership, which I think is like a much better, collective sort of superset of this. Usually we're thinking about people who are artists or designers or like YouTubers or people who just kind of have content creation as the core. But of course that's not the definition of a creator or shouldn't be. Rather, Spencer, as you kind of look at things that are not necessary consumer apps or you kind of look at DeFi apps or anything else in this space.
00:12:52.994 - 00:13:03.560, Speaker A: As an investor, how do you think about what ownership economy means to those types of businesses and have you seen any from new patterns or trends or any observations there?
00:13:04.010 - 00:13:58.806, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think it's a great it's a super meaty question. I think ownership, it really gets to the heart of what is ownership? I think it can take many different forms. Right. You could argue that take Uniswap, for example, which is a decentralized exchange protocol. Right now, the uni token that governs the protocol, it has some ability to take fees that the protocol generates in terms of transaction volume. But in addition to that, liquidity providers, people who provision their own tokens to help the liquidity of a given market, they also have ownership of individual liquidity pools in the form of LP tokens and they also get a cut of fees. Ownership can manifest in ways such as revenue sharing and the list kind of goes on.
00:13:58.806 - 00:14:49.174, Speaker C: It goes back to what I was saying about how tokens are programmable. I think what I would love to see more of is we're in the early days of this. Jesse, our partner, has written this kind of amazing piece called Progressive Decentralization, which I encourage everyone to read. And many of the companies that started with Progressive Decentralization, they exited to their community with a very simple governance token, which is like, this is the protocol, here are some parameters and you can vote on those parameters or upgrade it in some way. And I think that's the tip of the iceberg. I think as we get kind of more robust as a community, there are just going to be so many different dimensions of ownership that will be coded into these smart contracts that are just a lot potentially more equitable and get at the heart of what we're actually.
00:14:49.212 - 00:15:34.950, Speaker A: Trying to do and maybe, I guess, similar. Yeah, that makes sense. And I think it's one of those things where kind of what we've seen the last year and a half or so has just been deployments of these things, but not active kind of tweaking or iterations on them. And basically, yeah, you're right, we're seeing that and it works at small scale. And the question is, will that scale up to a larger number of users? And my question for you, Lee, is you're obviously spending more time on understanding consumer applications and projects here. Are there sort of any differences in how you evaluate consumer companies in crypto versus non crypto or kind of what changes in that framework of deciding where opportunity is or where there's potential for larger growth?
00:15:36.650 - 00:16:35.946, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. I think it's actually more similar than not, where a lot of the same lessons and frameworks from traditional consumer investing do apply to crypto consumer investing as well. And that's because fundamentally, the humans are not different at the end of the day, the people who are using these applications are still the same people. And human needs have actually not changed that much. Even throughout the course of human history. Like at the very fundamental level, people all share the same underlying drivers and motivations, like the desire for connection, the desire for community, the desire for financial stability and earnings, wanting to seek love and meaning in their lives. And so the best consumer products, I think, all tap into one of those core human needs, but enables them in new and different ways.
00:16:35.946 - 00:16:55.700, Speaker B: So I think the way that these new crypto consumer platforms are enabling earnings or enabling connections to new people looks different than the prior generation of consumer apps. But ultimately, from my lens as an investor and as a user, the question is still what fundamental need is this solving for on the part of people?
00:16:57.430 - 00:17:14.630, Speaker A: That's a really interesting way to look at it. Yeah, that's super cool. I guess maybe does that differentiate when you look at marketplaces versus kind of social? What does that look like and how does the ownership economy change those dynamics?
00:17:16.090 - 00:18:40.974, Speaker B: Yeah, I think obviously marketplaces and social applications differ in terms of what is the user trying to accomplish when they get there and what does product market fit look like? I typically say that in a marketplace, product market fit is achieving liquidity meaning when you go to the marketplace, you're able to get what you want. That is product market fit for a marketplace versus in a social network, that's obviously quite different. You're there for entertainment, connection, utility of being able to communicate with your friends, et cetera. And so there's different core drivers there. But there's still metrics that you can leverage in order to kind of quantitatively assess our users getting their needs met through this product in a much more powerful way than prior generations or prior products did. As to how the ownership economy applies to this model, I think the theory, which is still very much like in its early days and still being refined, is that giving users ownership helps to bootstrap networks much more effectively and grow them into much more engaged networks than otherwise would have been possible. So historically, building a new network is essentially like an impossible Herculean feat.
00:18:40.974 - 00:18:44.498, Speaker B: It required Uber to raise billions and billions of dollars.
00:18:44.584 - 00:18:47.842, Speaker A: Facebook just makes yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:18:47.896 - 00:19:23.860, Speaker B: And giving users ownership tobu charges, all of that, and also can be used as a way to enhance retention. Not to mention ultimately there's a financial value proposition that gets layered on top of the core value proposition of the product itself as well. So I think all of those lenses taken together, it's really still about how much value is being driven to users lives by these new products. And ownership offers something new and different that is additive and incremental to the core product. But the core product still very much needs to work.
00:19:25.590 - 00:19:59.626, Speaker A: That'S extremely well put in and that makes absolute sense. This is great. I'll kind of pose the next question for both of you, which is do you kind of see this space evolving as in a way a parallel universe where the existing giants just get dethroned? Or how do you feel like the role of existing big companies, whether it's marketplaces or consumer companies, sort of come to think about Web Three and what kind of happens in a few years from now? Anyone can go, I don't have yeah.
00:19:59.808 - 00:20:49.606, Speaker B: Sure, I can take a stab at this. So I've spent a lot of time talking to executives and people who work at these Web Two giants and these network incumbents. I think they are smarter than we give them credit for, for sure. And I think they're going to be forced to respond in various ways. I think the key thing is that I think everyone is exploring or actively looking to integrate web Three elements into their products. They're looking to add crypto as a feature into their existing products because they realize this is where consumers are going. They want to own NFTs, they want to showcase them, they want to be able to have co ownership of a community, et cetera.
00:20:49.606 - 00:21:52.240, Speaker B: And so all of these Web Two networks are going to add crypto as a feature to their products, sort of akin to how Twitter added the hexagonal profile pictures. But at the same time, I think what they do in terms of fully leaning into the ownership economy is limited because they're not going to be able to offer the full spectrum of what ownership entails, which is ownership isn't just about owning a digital good and having it and being able to view it as an investment. It's also about responsibility and governance. And these incumbents are structured in such a way where they're limited in terms of the amount of governance rights they can actually confer to their users. And so I think if users value the whole spectrum of everything that is encompassed in ownership, I think the Web Two giants are going to be challenged in being able to fully meet that.
00:21:54.690 - 00:21:56.142, Speaker A: Anything to add, Spencer?
00:21:56.286 - 00:22:28.374, Speaker C: Yes, it's super meaty topic and I think it's always helpful to look through the lens of different industries. And I think I have a different hypothesis for maybe social media versus DeFi, for example, which I think like something like DeFi. We're going to see crypto, we'll see the larger banks and the legacy financial system kind of implemented, integrated on the back end and it'll probably just exist and users won't really know the difference of what they're using for their financial piping.
00:22:28.422 - 00:22:33.482, Speaker A: So you think that's more likely versus an alternative offering that just dethrones those institutions?
00:22:33.626 - 00:23:21.530, Speaker C: I think it's probably a bit of both, right? And it kind of sort of depends on the product. But I think the important part is crypto is pushing the boundaries of what these legacy institutions do, and that's universal to the entire space. At its core, though, I think the ownership economy represents a new chapter, frankly, in how we think about operating Internet companies. I would argue that at least our hypothesis as a fund is that the largest winners from here are going to be user owned networks as opposed to extracting companies. And we'll have to see if that gets proved out. But I think some of the early signs are really encouraging.
00:23:22.190 - 00:23:58.940, Speaker A: I absolutely agree. Want to kind of wrap this up and just ask one last question and we can go in deep if you want to, but if you want to just list things, that works as well. It can be independent of the ownership economy too. But what are some kind of anywhere from ideas to projects you're excited about that you would either like to see or you would like to see people explore more? And I'll kind of put that in context, which is about 1200 developers going to be building interesting things over the next four days and anywhere from inspirations for quick hack to quick improvements to potential businesses. What does that look like? Is there a wish list or things that you want to see more experimentation on?
00:24:02.350 - 00:24:03.930, Speaker B: Spencer, do you want to take that?
00:24:04.080 - 00:24:05.100, Speaker C: I can fire.
00:24:11.550 - 00:24:18.080, Speaker A: Perhaps what did you say? Maybe kind of looking at what's happening in DeFi right now and sort of what do you think things.
00:24:20.130 - 00:25:02.594, Speaker C: Like historically in hackathons, there's been a lot of remixing, right? Like taking this and using it with that and coming up with something. I think that's pretty cool. But I would love to see kind of more maybe experimentation in areas that we haven't had yet. An idea is on token level, so one thing that I've been looking at is Curves Ve, token mechanics, and there are some really cool things that they do to incentivize liquidity through different gauges and voting. Imagine taking that and changing it, altering it in order to produce a different outcome that would affect a system. I think also this idea of cross chain applications that really excites me. So imagine an NFT marketplace.
00:25:02.594 - 00:25:49.260, Speaker C: The order book is on one blockchain that's super fast, and maybe some other part is on Ethereum, which is more secure. I think cross chain is something that we're definitely thinking about at variant, and I know a lot of entrepreneurs are too. And then maybe if I have one more I'm always a fan of innovation around NFTs in general and they're just fun and doing fun things with the programmability of NFTs. Nounsdao is like a really interesting project that has this cool distribution mechanism. But I think there's a bigger idea maybe to work through there.
00:25:50.990 - 00:26:30.130, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll just tag some more ideas onto that list. We've been very interested in the category of Web three infrastructure. So kind of the core building blocks that are going to enable the next generation of applications is very interesting to us. I think there's some really key missing puzzle pieces to enable the next generation of consumer applications, including decentralized social graphs, being able to do account to account messaging on chain that's also missing. Beyond that. I think I'll put in a plug for fashion. NFTs.
00:26:30.130 - 00:27:00.530, Speaker B: I think the space is like all of the attention is on music NFTs, which we're also very bullish on. But I think there is something to be built around fashion and expression, self expression digitally through NFTs. And I think the exciting thing about Fashion NFTs is that you're not limited to the human form factor that we have in meat space. Fashion NFTs can look different than human fashion, I guess. I'm not even entirely sure what it could look like.
00:27:00.600 - 00:27:05.460, Speaker A: You're referring to the physical good piece of NFTs when you say fashion, is that correct?
00:27:06.970 - 00:28:04.550, Speaker B: Well, definitely it can be not linked to the physical fashion, but it can also transcend the way that we actually look physically. I refer to Twitter profile pictures as the first instance of digital fashion or Fashion NFTs actually, because they're essentially like adornment for this online profile that we all have. We don't change our outfits that often, but it's like one of the primary instances in which we can actually dress up our social profiles. I think there's going to be other places that we want to express ourselves and change our appearances in order to broadcast things about our identities or our communities. And then lastly, I'll say I think the wallet space is super interesting and there are probably going to be multiple winning wallets, perhaps designed for different demographics or different use cases. So excited to see more innovation there.
00:28:04.700 - 00:28:17.180, Speaker A: That is an impressive comprehensive list that I think gives definitely a couple hundred people good ideas to kind of explore. And this is amazing. Well, I think that's a perfect note to end on. Unless Spencer, you want to add something?
00:28:17.870 - 00:28:31.520, Speaker C: I was just going to say both Lee and I are like we're on Twitter all the time. We love connecting with entrepreneurs. If you're a hackathon participant and you want some feedback on your idea, no promises that we can get back to everyone, but hit us up. Happy to give you.
00:28:32.530 - 00:28:46.818, Speaker A: Yeah. And anybody who wants to chat with them. You can also send me a note on Discord and I'll be able to forward that request to them as well. So, Lee, Spencer, thank you so much for giving your time and for this amazing chat. And we'll keep you posted on what comes out of the hackathon.
00:28:46.954 - 00:28:49.350, Speaker B: You awesome. Thanks so much.
00:28:49.500 - 00:28:50.374, Speaker C: Thanks so much.
00:28:50.492 - 00:28:51.560, Speaker B: Good luck, everyone.
00:28:52.410 - 00:28:52.886, Speaker A: See you.
00:28:52.908 - 00:28:53.570, Speaker B: Right, bye.
