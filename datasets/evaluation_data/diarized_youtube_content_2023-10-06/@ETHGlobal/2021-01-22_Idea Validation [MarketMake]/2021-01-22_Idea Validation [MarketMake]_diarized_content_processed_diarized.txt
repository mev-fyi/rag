00:00:01.050 - 00:00:37.140, Speaker A: Then we can kick it off. Let me just verify that it's going properly. All right, perfect. So I'll do redo the short intro just to get us started. Welcome, everybody, to the end of week one, Market Make. Congratulations, you survived your first week of the hackathon. Kudos.
00:00:37.140 - 00:01:23.672, Speaker A: Good job. So what this event is going to be is it's a pretty basic session. What we're going to do is, if you haven't signed up already, please add your name to the Google Doc in the chat. If you don't see it, can somebody please send it again? Or I can grab it, but you're going to have a few minutes to just talk about what you have scoped out to build over the next few weeks. We want you to be able to describe your project pretty concisely. Don't try to take ten minutes and a whole slide presentation. And we have with us two Ave team members, David and Ernesto, and then another member of Lemniscap Saishav, and they are going to be giving you feedback about the scope of your project.
00:01:23.672 - 00:02:16.996, Speaker A: Any tips or suggestions to help you improve as you're building? So I think David and Ernesto have given intros before, but, Seishav, do you want to give a quick just intro to yourself in Lemniscap before we jump into it? You're muted. Hi. There we go. I think that's fine. Yeah. I actually got down into crypto in 2016 after the Indian government actually did something which was very crazy for our time, is we had something called Demonetization, where the government decided to just ban large currency notes overnight, and that got me interested into Bitcoin. And I got in in 2016.
00:02:16.996 - 00:02:52.384, Speaker A: We followed up with the Ethereum Hype and everything that was building on Ethereum. Everything was new for the first time, and 2017 was a good time. Met a lot of people, and I came across with my partner, Roderick. We caught up in Hong Kong for an event, and we were in the same time looking to do funds and start off from investing our own money and some friends and family money. We set up Lemniscap in 2000 and early 2018, and we have a very wide mandate within the crypto space. So we do D five. We do Equity.
00:02:52.384 - 00:03:20.812, Speaker A: We have played all kind of narratives, but the idea is to backtop talents, and we look at talents which are trying to build some interesting product and new code as such. Right. Happy to see what projects people here are building. Right, awesome. Yeah. Just really quick, if it wasn't clear for anybody putting their name in that document, you should be putting your names at the bottom of it and not rearranging the order. It looks like some people are moving around.
00:03:20.812 - 00:03:40.548, Speaker A: Unless you're moving your own name, don't cut in line. All right, we're going to jump into it. Isaac, I think you are first, so take it away. So the presentation, just try to keep it pretty short, maybe one or two minutes max. Just describe the idea of what you're doing and then we'll see how this goes. Sure. Hi everyone.
00:03:40.548 - 00:05:13.120, Speaker A: We are building an unsecured lending vault strategy. So the idea is that we can have a pool of community capital which is lent out to borrowers through like a trusted risk assessor off chain. So the strategy of the vault would be anyone that puts money in here gets someone who's good at scoring people and managing unsecured loans off chain through, like, traditional credit means would kind of whitelist people and then those people would be able to take out loans from the pool of capital and then there'd be so borrowers would be able to take out loans more like traditional style consumer loans that they don't have to post capital for and then they repay it. And then people that put capital into the lending vault similar to another vault investment thing would get rewards based on how well the risk assessor did in judging if people are going to pay back the loans. So we plan to use Aave's delegated credit vault where we'll have a contract where people put the community capital in it'll go into the ave lending pool and then we'll have basically a trusted person that whitelists who gets to borrow and then when that happens the person can borrow. I have some unknowns like if we want to do the ave interest rate plus an additional amount I'll have some technical questions that I'll post in the channel about where exactly the repayment should go. Does it have to go through another contract? But that's the general idea.
00:05:13.120 - 00:06:16.064, Speaker A: Does that make sense? Yeah, I think so. Definitely make full sense. I think also the idea should be within the scope of the hackathon if you center yourself on that contract managing the credit delegation so definitely go on with that and just let us know about the questions about the repayment and we could try to help. Cool. I think the idea has it's a good idea, it's something which is not very crowded in the market so it's still an area which has to be explored which is lower collateral or no collateral loans as such. Right. I think where it matters I like the approach which you are taking which makes it easy to implement or at least get off is have a fund manager who basically then manages the fund and distributes deploys the capital as such and judges risk.
00:06:16.064 - 00:06:42.670, Speaker A: Right. I do think there are good opportunities to work with loan originators instead directly in the market. Right. And who would originate loans. There are few projects who are working on that like maple and all but it's still an unexplored area where no one's got a success. So I think it's a very interesting idea to at least segment to work on and build something. Great, thanks.
00:06:42.670 - 00:07:07.300, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a great idea. I guess besides what's already been said. The pitch was pretty good. The one sentence or the first few sentences was spot on. Then it probably got a bit complex after that. So maybe just work on that part of the pitch. But the idea, I think definitely it's interesting, has legs.
00:07:07.300 - 00:08:00.304, Speaker A: It's great you're using credit delegation as well. Good work. Thanks everyone for the feedback. Real quick, how are you going to use Bloom? I know there's an entire identity management system, but how do you plan to actually integrate Bloom with this? Sure, let me give you a quick swim lanes and I'll post a link here. But basically what happens is that the borrower has to do the KYC and credit check where they can pull their score from Bloom and then they can basically share it to an Oracle that will then whitelist none of the actual data goes on chain, but basically the credit checks happen off chain. They share the fact that they've been KYC'd and credit checked and then that kind of puts them into a risk bucket and then that just whitelists. This address belongs to this risk bucket on chain.
00:08:00.304 - 00:08:24.572, Speaker A: So the Bloom component is off chain. They get their credit score and KYC through an app and then that gets shared on chain through just like a simple oracle or chain link thing. Okay, but the KYC never ends up on chain. Right? Right. It's just the fact that the address has been whitelisted in KYC. It's not like any PII goes on chain. Cool.
00:08:24.572 - 00:08:46.896, Speaker A: Okay, great. Yeah, that makes sense. All right, any final comments? If not, we can move on. Thanks Isaac, for being the first one. Seems like the other people said it's a promising concept. Is bloom already on Minnet as well. Actually, none of it actually has to happen on chain.
00:08:46.896 - 00:09:36.740, Speaker A: So the actual credentials of KYC and credit information is all issued off chain and it's just a matter of plugging into a chain link adapter. So yeah, it can go on chain. Thanks Isaac. Marco, are you ready to go? Yeah. All right, take it away. Hello everyone with our team, we are working at product that we are calling Libave at the moment, and it's non custodial leverage trading application using Ave and one inch. Basically it started all from the one inch bounty idea of creating leverage position using Flash loans, Ave liquidity and the one inch API.
00:09:36.740 - 00:11:29.610, Speaker A: So yeah, basically the application for the end user will be an interface similar to all those AMM interfaces, where the user will pick an asset that he will want to use as collateral and the asset that he wants to take the leverage on. He will be able to both take a long position and a short position and choose which kind of leverage if you want to go two x, three x, four x and so on. And then after he opens the position, our idea is that he'll see an interface similar to a centralized exchange where he will see his liquidation price, his profit and loss and stuff like that. Of course, if someone has already some position opened with Ave, it can mix it up a bit. So we are still thinking like how to manage that. Then we are thinking also not sure if we'll make it by the academy, but some other ideas is to add stop loss and take profit functions so that after the user open a position, he can also decide to put a stop loss, which could be leveraged with the chain link Oracle. So, yeah, that's basically the main idea for this project.
00:11:29.610 - 00:12:29.510, Speaker A: Um, yeah, I can go first. Yeah, I like the deal, it's already out there since our version two of the protocol was published. So for sure it has some future, I think. I have a question that is also related with your pitch. Is that do you tokenize these positions? And also if you mentioned that it's two x, three x, four x, but is this granular that you can go at any x leverage that you want or is just fixed branches of like doing two or three x? I think that is important to describe when you do the final presentation. But it's also a question. Okay, yeah, that's a good point and I don't think we have an answer yet.
00:12:29.510 - 00:13:11.060, Speaker A: From technical point of view, it's no problem. I mean, we would do it either way. I think it's more a question from user experience point of view. And thinking about it now, I would probably go maybe like most of centralized exchange with fixed options. So like two x, three x, four x, that's like what I'm thinking now. But yeah, we are still evaluating and it's also possible to make it granular and we'll evaluate it better from a user experience point of view. Okay, great.
00:13:11.060 - 00:15:03.072, Speaker A: I agree that it's an interesting idea and I actually think Mark, there's another project which is working on using RWE for delegation and using that as leverage. It's called market. It's also an interesting project that they're working on leverage, where they take away delegation as the source of credit. As such, I'm just wondering how do you manage liquidation in this case? Hello? Yeah, sorry, I lost you for a few seconds. How would you manage liquidation? What's your idea to manage liquidation? And would that restrict you in just provide like do you want to provide can this short or long any assets or would it be certain market cap assets which are easy to liquidate them? So the idea is to give opportunity to the user to use any tokens as collateral that are on Ave and at the same time take a long position or a short position on any tokens that are present on ave well for the liquidation. The idea for now is that if the position goes underwater so l factor under one, it will just be liquidated by some bots that are already liquidating. Those positions, those health factor below one positions.
00:15:03.072 - 00:16:00.270, Speaker A: And then there's also the idea to add the possibility to set a stop loss so in that case that the position gets closed before getting liquidated. And that would be managed with the chain link Oracle. Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I think maybe also having ways to unleverage as well. So once you've leveraged, maybe you change your mind, then unleveraging, that would be useful. The thing is with stop losses is that when the market tanks, you're selling into the tanking market. So maybe there's some dynamics there to think about that the stop loss may not be the best time for them to sell or cover their positions.
00:16:00.270 - 00:16:27.270, Speaker A: And I think you could probably do it. Sounds like a really good idea. And I think you could around like, safety and UX. That's probably a big thing because you're creating these, I guess, financial weapons for people to use. It's good if you can help them stay safe as well. So, yeah, that'll be my feedback. Big warnings, do not use too much leverage.
00:16:27.270 - 00:16:45.102, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. Thanks Marco. Thank you. All right, we're going to move on to the next project, which is Audits are Dead. Jack, you want to start off? Hey guys, can you hear me? Yep. Cool. Yeah.
00:16:45.102 - 00:17:49.380, Speaker A: So some of you may remember this idea from the brainstorm session last week, but yeah, so basically what we want to make is a two sided insurance marketplace. So basically smart contract insurance. And we want to have stakers on one side who see a yield and they decide, okay, I like this yield, I'm going to stake in this pool. And then projects on the other side where we basically price their insurance and they say, okay, we like this price, we're going to buy the insurance. And in the middle is sort of our internal audit team that looks at these contracts that these protocols have and basically prices the insurance based on the risk, the perceived risk, so that way the stakers don't have to do any heavy lifting of deciding if a protocol is safe or not. And looking at the smart contracts. And the projects get a fair rate based on experts in the field who have decided what the rate should be.
00:17:49.380 - 00:18:28.488, Speaker A: And then on the back end, the staking pool is going to deposit with Ave. So we're going to have the Ave yield from depositing and then also the insurance fee yields combining to make a big yield for our stakers. And that's the idea. There's a lot more details, but that's kind of the gist of it. Okay, I'll go first. I think insurance is a very obvious use case, especially with the growth in DeFi right now. I think you have two or three players there's.
00:18:28.488 - 00:19:38.352, Speaker A: Nexus Mutual, I want to understand is how do you differentiate yourself also from what I understood from you, you're expecting the buyers to be projects and you're not looking at end users as buyers, is that correct? Yes, exactly. So that's one of the differences that we think is sort of a big deal, is individual users. You don't go to a bank and try to get a bank account and they say, okay, great, now go across the street to the insurance firm and buy insurance for your bank account in case the bank gets robbed. So we think from a UX perspective, it makes a lot more sense if the protocols are buying the insurance and not the users. And then in terms of Nexus Mutual, we think they don't really have a good way of pricing their insurance. There's this whole issue with audits and how it's kind of a one time point in time thing, and protocols get hacked even after audits. And so Nexus Mutual is kind of relying on those audits as well and saying, okay, this audit six months ago, we're going to price this protocol based on that audit, or kind of finger in the air.
00:19:38.352 - 00:21:00.236, Speaker A: So we're going to have an internal team that has their incentives aligned with the stakers to kind of choose the right protocols to put in the pool at the right price, kind of like an actuary. And a real insurance firm would price insurance. And there's a couple other things with Nexus Mutual we don't really like, but especially when the individual has to buy the insurance and not the protocol, they have to decide how long they want the insurance for. And if you are going into Ave and two weeks later you're going into compound because they have a higher yield and you're kind of moving funds around, you have no idea how long you want to buy insurance for. So it doesn't make sense to us that you have to try to guess how long you're going to be in a certain protocol for and buy insurance based on that and then renew insurance based on that. Okay, I think that's an interesting idea to I just wonder because of your approaches to get projects, so say the idea would be to talk to Ave, the team, to get the whole protocol insured by the protocol. I would wonder, what would you think? How would projects basically fund this right now? It would be some new kind of expenditure for a protocol, in a sense, 100%.
00:21:00.236 - 00:21:41.176, Speaker A: Have you had any of this discussion with any teams to get their feedback on that? I think that would be very important right. To understand how your customer thinks it yeah, we think that's a really important point. That's a good point that you brought up. And Ave is really interesting because they obviously have their own safety module and you may not know this, but they pay, I think, 550 AV a month to that, or is that a day? Basically, we did the calculation and Ave is currently paying 40 million a day. Yeah. So you guys are paying $40 million a year for insurance. If you just convert that OB into US dollars, it's 40 million a year.
00:21:41.176 - 00:22:55.056, Speaker A: So that's like a high price to pay for insurance. And obviously projects right now are paying for those point in time audits, which run from ten grand and upwards probably. So we think there's a good middle ground that we can find where projects would maybe take some of that audit money that they would be paying for audits every year, every six months, and instead have a full solution. Where they can be sure that if in the event of a hack, they're going to be covered, their users are going to be fine, and they're not going to lose any money. And we think they can bring a lot more users into their protocol if they can make that claim that they're fully insured. I think I have some questions. The main question is, for what I understand, especially for what you just explained, you depend a lot on having your point of differentiation with Nexus Mutual is having a group of experts that are evaluating continuously a protocol that looks like a really thing in the sense that, end of the day, is based on trust.
00:22:55.056 - 00:23:49.856, Speaker A: Trust build on reputation as an auditor. And those professionals, they have high cash, let's say. So taking into account that and the other systems that exist, like for example, Daba protocol that yeah. Spends, if you understand those 550, like spending on insurance. It's not exactly like that usually how I understand it, but it's 40 million and it has the capacity to spend 40 million in order to build, let's say, a pot to actually cover a meaningful amount of the stake. How do you plan to incentivize auditors at the same time that you build a really big pot and it's attractive for stakers, right? Yeah, those are two really important questions. I think on the auditor side, like you're right, right now auditors are in a great place.
00:23:49.856 - 00:24:40.032, Speaker A: They are booked for the next six months straight and they're making a lot of money doing those audits. So it is going to be a little bit challenging to try to get auditors on board. But we think we can actually pay them a decent amount of money. And obviously the first few that we bring on will give them equity and we'll give them kind of, we think, a good incentivization and there's a lot of really talented auditors out there. The problem isn't actually the talent of the auditors. The problem is that it's just a point in time audit and they look at it for a month or a week and they say, okay, this point in time, this code base has an issue you can fix that has this vulnerability, and then they don't look at the code base until you pay them again. So we're just trying to have people that look at a code base and then they kind of track the changes as it goes along, which aren't usually big changes.
00:24:40.032 - 00:25:41.492, Speaker A: Like not everyone's launching V two or whatever it is every month. So we actually think it could make a lot of sense for auditors to stay on and just sort of track the projects as they make smaller changes and go down the road. But I agree it'll be challenging to bring on auditors and pay them right and kind of get that all set up, especially get the incentives aligned so that these auditors kind of are in it with the stakers and they're choosing the right price and the right protocols to bring into the platform. And then your second point on the of insurance pool, yeah, I mean you guys have a $600 million. Last I checked it was 600 or $550,000,000 insurance pool and you've got 30% of that available for if a hack happens because that's the slashing rate. So you've got call it 200 million to cover any insurance hack that happens on AV. And yeah, we don't have an insurance pool yet so that's kind of going to be one of those things that you need to bootstrap a little bit.
00:25:41.492 - 00:26:25.030, Speaker A: Maybe we make our own token to kind of make more incentives at the beginning to kind of get people going into the pool. I like what you guys did which was you started paying people before the insurance was actually live. So you said here's this pool, we're going to pay you 400 Ave and just kind of get it going and get the pool to a good decent amount in there and then you activated like okay, this is live. Now if there's a hack, you guys get slashed up to 30%. So yeah, I think that's a really good point too and that's something that's going to be challenging is like building a big pool like 600 million is massive. You guys are the biggest player in insurance by far right now. So yeah, that's going to be a challenge for sure.
00:26:25.030 - 00:27:24.452, Speaker A: Apart from the questions, I think there is a lot of place in the market because native insurance pools on specific protocols can live together with external insurance models for sure. The insurance business is huge out there and we are just starting on DeFi. Why not to try? I think that there is some place to spot technical questions. I don't have so much feedback because I don't know how is the system. Yeah, we'll release more, we've got most of the smart contracts written but we'll kind of give more detail around that sooner than later. But yeah, I agree. I think native insurance platforms can kind of exist in harmony with other external insurance platforms and they kind of need each other know, reinsurance at some point and that kind of thing.
00:27:24.452 - 00:27:37.630, Speaker A: So I agree. Hi Jack, I think we're going to move on to the next project. That was some good discussion. I hate to leave it but yeah, we're going to move on. Thanks a lot guys, appreciate it. Thank you. Very good and ambitious project by the way.
00:27:37.630 - 00:28:17.048, Speaker A: Sorry, David. That's all I have. Yeah, I'll get you next time, David. Thanks guys. Next up we have Hello Token Wahid if you want to start hi guys, how are you? Can you guys see my screen? Yes, go ahead. Yeah, this is hello, Token. It's like I'm aspiring to develop a protocol that the participant of that protocol can buy crypto under low price than the current at the stage of market.
00:28:17.048 - 00:29:07.160, Speaker A: For example, how it works. Here we have Alice, Bob and John Invest and then a rest of 17. There is 20 participants in the network, each one of them contributing $1,000. Then we get 20,000 in the pool in the hello token, each contributing $1,000. So in this $20,000 we buy say for example at the time it is 40,000 per PTC. We bought, like, half PTC. And among the 20 people, 20 members of the pool compete to buy this half PTC at a lower price.
00:29:07.160 - 00:30:22.336, Speaker A: Whoever bid lower will get that half PTC. And then a small amount of like five percentage of the money will go to the protocol and the remaining the pending amount will be distributed among the 20 members. For example, this is 20,000 is the value for RPTC and then the Raj is bidding for lowest price rest of them, everyone else will bid. Raj is the lowest bidder. He bidding for $16,000 for this half PTC, but it is actually 20,000 at the time. So this is the lowest bid. And then he gets the protocol like allocates this half BTC to Raj and then deducts the 20,000, takes the 16,000 and remaining $4,000 will be distributed among the rest of the people, $200 per guy.
00:30:22.336 - 00:31:26.148, Speaker A: So it will go to rest of the guys. So organizer will take $1,000 from virage fees and then finally he get an RPTC for 16,000. This is the project I'm trying to develop. I'm trying to get an idea validation with you. What do you think of this? Am I audible? Hello? Yes. My first question so basically this is like a group investment or a pooled investment that has a token is Hello Token just the name of the project or is there some sort of token involved? Yeah, Hello Token is the thing but eventually I'm aspiring to develop token which shall incentivize the people as well. When you invest $1,000 and you didn't get the bid, you get some amount of allow token as a reward point.
00:31:26.148 - 00:32:33.048, Speaker A: Reward so it's like a reward, like something like you purchase anything, you get reward, right? Something like that, yeah, that makes sense, yeah. Any other feedback from David or Ernesto? Anybody? Yeah, I can go first you buy the half BTC, spend that 20 20,000 that person bids 16,000, Raj bids 16,000, the Organ Labs takes 1000 isn't there $15,000 that gets distributed to the rest of the participants? No, the 15,000 is amount spent on PTC. Right. $20,000 spent on bitcoin. So the remaining amount is actually the people will get benefit by time. Whoever is bidding lower will be awarded. Yes, but Raj does.
00:32:33.048 - 00:33:18.490, Speaker A: He transfers $16,000 to the pool. Yeah. And then organizer takes 1000 and then there's $15,000 for the pool. Right, yes. Sorry, I'm not really sure if wholesale crypto sales exist. If you go to Binance or something like this, you see the same prices independently on the size of the trade. So I don't see that it would work because the benefit for the members is like they get a chance to buy crypto at a lower price.
00:33:18.490 - 00:34:00.310, Speaker A: I understand that concept. What I'm confused about is the final amount. So why is it $4,000 and not $15,000 that gets distributed to the other participants if someone bid $16,000? And then besides that, maybe that's just a simple sort of math thing. Is that in Ethereum, if I'm assuming you're doing this on Ethereum, there's 18 decimal places, so the lowest bid will always be like 0.1. Yeah. If you're going for the lowest bid, it would make sense that everyone will just bid the lowest possible number. Right, right.
00:34:00.310 - 00:34:26.350, Speaker A: It's just a high level presentation. Maybe that game mechanic. Think about that a bit. There's other sort of mechanisms where you can do the second highest bid. I think that generally in auctions, that can be beneficial. And also it can be beneficial for the participants as well, because you probably want the higher bid, not the lower bid. Right.
00:34:26.350 - 00:34:50.592, Speaker A: So then people don't lose out as much. Yeah. Would be an improvement. Yeah, exactly. I think there's something there that's interesting as more of like a game play thing. Legality, I'm not sure about, but it sounds a bit like a lottery type style. But I guess he has some sort of auction mechanism.
00:34:50.592 - 00:35:40.310, Speaker A: It's interesting. Thank you. Yeah. Anyone else have anything else to say? Could I go spend my time in developing this idea into product? What do you think? I think you should research on existing mechanisms, outshoot mechanisms out there. Because I agree also with David that maybe the idea is a bit of change the direction to maybe get a bigger understanding of the other protocols of auctions out there and trying to build something related with that. I will focus more on that because it seems for me that you are trying to build an auction system. But if you want to make it interesting, introduce some gamification, for example.
00:35:40.310 - 00:36:26.192, Speaker A: Dear Vahit, I think two things. The first, I think your original idea, my English isn't very good, I misunderstand something, but my impression that your original idea is not very good because crypto wholesale sales probably don't exist. But there is a way to make your project better. You can make sales of NFTs. NFT can represent, for example, a real estate property, a house, and for this case, your project. Would probably work. So I advise you to add NFTs and buy not just crypto, but real world scenes.
00:36:26.192 - 00:36:48.684, Speaker A: Then it will work. Maybe. Sure. Thank you very much for your feedback. Yeah, I also think it's a good idea to involve real assets. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.
00:36:48.684 - 00:37:12.950, Speaker A: Thanks for the opportunity. Bye. Thanks for presenting. All right, next up is Ave B. I don't see a name there, but hopefully they're ready. Ave b, is that you, Tillman? No, I see your hand up. I'll give one more second for Ave B to show up.
00:37:12.950 - 00:37:38.350, Speaker A: All right, we're going to move on to Finance Club. Yes, I'm available here, so let me just perfect. Go ahead, share my screen. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I hope you are able to see my screen and things.
00:37:38.350 - 00:38:28.488, Speaker A: So I'm building something for the entire crypto community around the world. And even for people who are not introduced to the crypto. We were thinking of a solution where the regular fans, regular users, the mass market has to adopt crypto and they have to come in and gain Roa from their investments. The problem that exists in the world today is that many people around the world are hesitant or scared to invest in the stock market or crypto market because they don't have knowledge about the existing assets. If someone doesn't know about Bitcoin, they don't want to invest there. But all over the world we have fans for sports stars, for other celebrities, like in movies or whatever, who have a lot of knowledge and passion towards their particular sport and favorite game. And we are enabling them to invest in their favorite players, our favorite games.
00:38:28.488 - 00:39:17.536, Speaker A: Thereby they can gain ROI on their investment. This brings in financial inclusion around the world, and that's the goal and objective of our project. What we are planning to build is a platform where users can buy the celebrity tokens and trade them. This also eliminates all the geographical barriers that we have because we are not using fiat currency, but blockchain based, which is completely global. The platform we are building will enable people to buy and sell ERC 20 Tokens, which will be, for each celebrity, will create an ERC 20 Token. There'll also be an ERC 721, which is an NFT that can be owned by a particular person. Which means if you own an NFT token and there is a lot of trading happening on that partnered ERC 20, you're going to get a portion of the fees, the trading fees that we are going to charge.
00:39:17.536 - 00:40:01.332, Speaker A: And that's how we have built this entire platform. Now, if we look at the supply and demand plays a major role here because if a player scores well in a particular match, then the demand for that player is going to go up. And we leave it to the market to decide upon the price of that particular player based on future predictions, based on future performance, the price might get up or down. And this is indirectly influenced by that performance. Right. So we have planned to use Ethereum and layer two Matic network to build this platform because of the relay network, because of higher transaction volumes and lesser fees and things like that, that Matic provides. I also attended this webinar on Avegochi.
00:40:01.332 - 00:40:38.320, Speaker A: So I'm planning to bring in my ERC 721 on the Avegochi platform so that we can stake and all of the advantages of Avegorchi also will come in. I've created a landing page for this and finance is the tagline we have is finance for fans. We want to bring in all the fans around the world into the platform. Now this is the POC we have built. This is an exchange where people can trade their favorite players like you have in sports called as cricket. I have just added a dummy, let's say three players which can be traded all along. Users can place orders.
00:40:38.320 - 00:41:14.880, Speaker A: The important part is fees can be either paid by Ether or by the fancy token that we are going to create. We'll have our own ERC 20 token which can be used to pay the transaction fees. We have currently set the transaction fees to be one percentage but it can vary based on the market dynamics and it's in a very early stage like the POC is built. But there's a lot of other work to do. The home page, the landing page and all of these things. But I hope to do that by the end of this hackathon. And with that we'll also get into the licensing part of it because that's a question that I most often get with regards to license.
00:41:14.880 - 00:42:04.044, Speaker A: There are two things when it comes to sports trading platforms or the celebrity trading platforms kind of a thing. There is game of Skills and a Game of chance. Game of Chance includes lottery and things like that where you invest somewhere you don't have any control over the price. But Game of Skills talks about your predictions, your performance analysis and things like that. So Finance Club will be a game of skills rather than a game of chance so that we won't face any licensing issues with the players or the franchises that we are working with. Also we'll put a clear disclaimer that Finance Club is nowhere related into these players or the franchises and hence we'll also not get legal issues from those kind of franchises or the players. Also in the future we are planning to partner with these sports stars and franchises so that they become a partner.
00:42:04.044 - 00:42:30.984, Speaker A: Hence we don't face this. A reserve will be maintained. So every time a new token is created for a particular player, let's say Cristiano Ronaldo, we'll maintain a reserve of Ether of 10%, let's say. And whenever this person wants to claim royalty they can claim from the reserve that we have for this person. It can be considered as an insurance I can say. And with that I come to the end of the presentation and I'm looking for feedback. Thank you.
00:42:30.984 - 00:43:03.828, Speaker A: From Finance Club. Cool. So right off the bat, these sort of things always make me think of that. They'll eventually devolve into assassination markets because you can buy stock in the future of somebody good or bad. Hopefully this doesn't turn into that. So who gates or who controls the creation of each fan token? I'm assuming that would be you guys because you don't want like ten tokens per sports person. That's right.
00:43:03.828 - 00:43:37.512, Speaker A: In the initial stages it will be the admins, the founders who will be creating this. So currently it is myself. I'll be the sole admin and the sole developer of this platform. And I'll be governing the entire token creation. And I'll be choosing the players who has to be in the market. But later we are planning to decentralize this and bring in other users and we'll have validators and voters. So if there's a request for creation of a particular fan token, then the other people, the validators can vote for their favorite players and that will be taken into consideration to create the players.
00:43:37.512 - 00:44:17.656, Speaker A: So completely decentralizing. This is the objective. But that can take about a year or so or a number of users before we can get to that stage. Somebody beat me to it in the chat. But my next question was going to be, if you aren't decentralized from day one and you're controlling who gets listed, there might be some IP or some legal questions about you're benefiting from the likeness or the brand of somebody else. Obviously this is just a hackathon. I don't expect you to have lawyers on your team, but that's definitely something to consider.
00:44:17.656 - 00:44:44.150, Speaker A: It's a long sure, yes. We have been looking at all of the other. There's a huge player called Dream Eleven based in India, which is into fantasy sports. So they have not got any licensing or any partnerships with the player. What they do is, because it's a game of skills, they don't really get these kind of issues. But partnering with these players also give them an advantage. And one of the reasons why we have this reserve fund maintained is to face legal issues in the future if it comes.
00:44:44.150 - 00:45:09.070, Speaker A: Good. Good plan. Any other comments from David Ernesto? Go ahead. Just a few questions. So I like the idea of making an NFT for a market and getting some part of the fees. What I don't understand is, since it's not licensed right. So if it's like NBA TOPSHOT, which is licensed, there's a value to it.
00:45:09.070 - 00:45:42.512, Speaker A: These are not licensed. You're just creating ERC 20 and you're calling, giving them a name, say Cristiano Ronaldo. Right, right, yeah. Why would someone trade it? Why would I trade the, ERC 20? Okay. This is associated with the name, and any ERC 20 token that we see on the market today has a use case behind it. Instead of it being a protocol or DFI level use case, this is a performance use case based on sports. And it is just a virtual token that we are creating that's going to be sold and bought by people based on the performance and demand for that particular token.
00:45:42.512 - 00:46:16.720, Speaker A: It's just a name given to the ASC 20 token, as you told. But even if you look at any of the fantasy sports virtual tokens that we have in the world today, that's also virtual. Let's say you have a team and you are creating a virtual token for that. If you create your own players, your own teams for that, and the team does well, if they hit a four, if they hit a goal, then you're getting paid for that. It's a similar concept to that, just that it's based on a blockchain. And the virtual currency is actually a tradable token, completely transparent and things like that. All of the advantages of blockchain come into this.
00:46:16.720 - 00:47:21.280, Speaker A: And that's the reason why virtual tokens have been converted into ERC 20. But as you told, it's a regular ERC 20 token and we cannot really match this or partner this with a particular player. So I hope it will be helpful. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to validate my idea in the first place in this hackathon. I'm just trying to lead you to basically so when you compare it to normal games, say you said if a player hits a four, right, they get paid, right? So there's a payment that is happening that is making me select that player, right? So if I buy Ronaldo and he performs better, what do I get? What do I get from consider there's a tournament happening and Cristiano Ronaldo hits a goal, he gets two goals and whatever the man of the series or things like that, the future expectations that he will hit a goal in the next match will go up. So the demand will go up and hence the price of that particular token might also go up. It is indirectly related to the performance.
00:47:21.280 - 00:48:13.428, Speaker A: I cannot say, okay, if he hits a goal, the price is going to go up by 20% or whatever. I cannot fix that because the market, just like a BTC market, is based on supply and demand and leave it to the market to see how many goals he hits and the future predictions and the expectation of the fans for that particular player. And based on that, the price of the token will be decided by the market. And I'm not going to fix something like if there is a goal, the price is going to go up by 5% or something that I think will not really serve the purpose of creating tokens for the celebrities. I just think you need to think of a payout, right? There's no payout. I don't see like if you say a prediction market right. So when you say prediction market, what happens is one side gets paid out more than they put in here.
00:48:13.428 - 00:48:31.660, Speaker A: I don't see a payout as such. Right. Why would I buy a token which there's no settlement of a payout. Right. So I think you need to put some kind of gameplay or something that generates some kind of revenue or something that is a payout for one party right. Okay. Of one side of the trade.
00:48:31.660 - 00:49:03.348, Speaker A: Others, these are just a random, ERC, 20, which I don't know why would people buy or sell. Okay, probably that's a good point. I'll take that into consideration and work on that a little bit more. So you're telling me something which gets directly related to the performance of the player has to be inbuilt into the platform. Only then there will be a payout and result of my investment and things like that. If I'm right. Correct me if I'm wrong.
00:49:03.348 - 00:49:08.100, Speaker A: Kind of. Yes. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Thank you for the feedback. I'll take that into consideration.
00:49:08.100 - 00:49:34.880, Speaker A: Probably in the next meeting we can discuss more about that. I would say the same. Even you realized that you compare with a fantasy football game or something. But what matters there is that there is end game, there is objective. The objective is to build the best team. And you get the best team by the performance during the year, during the tournament. Right.
00:49:34.880 - 00:50:16.456, Speaker A: If you build something like that, then the tokenization is fine because you can, for example, calculate fractions of the user, so somebody can have, like imagine 1% of Cristiano Ronaldo and another the 10% of Messi. And taking into account your team on that direction, you can give a winner, for example, and you can put part of the fees or whatever on the winner. But without the game itself defined, the trade doesn't mean anything. I agree with Saisha that I don't see the reason to buy the tokens. Got it. Okay. I have an objective.
00:50:16.456 - 00:50:36.576, Speaker A: Yeah. I can implement that. But given the time frame of the hackathon, I don't not on the time frame, but in terms of the design, like what you want to build at least. Okay, got it. Thanks for the feedback. Yes. I'll incorporate that into the platform and think more about how can we do that and directly have a partnership with the performance of the player.
00:50:36.576 - 00:50:55.790, Speaker A: Good point. Actually, I'll just have a quick point. Yeah. So it's the same exactly what the guys have already said. I think maybe on the technical level, you know about, ERC, twenty S and NFTs and that's really good. So technically you're good. But I think maybe on the economic side is probably where you need more work.
00:50:55.790 - 00:51:28.804, Speaker A: People don't just trade tokens for no reason. And price doesn't just go up for no reason. You need some inherent value of some sort. So whether it's partnerships with the clubs or maybe you can tie in with avagotchi somehow, right? If these tokens mean that you can have an avagotchi soccer hat that looks like the soccer player or a jersey or something, maybe that's valuable and then maybe that's a reason. But there needs some tie into something somewhere. So yeah, let's have a think about thanks. Thanks.
00:51:28.804 - 00:51:55.836, Speaker A: I'll think about the economics part of it. Great comments. Thanks for sharing, Raghu. We're going to move on to Victor and just as a warning for everybody, we are not going to be able to get through everybody with the full set. I'll stay on after eleven. This session is supposed to go until 1130 Eastern. So we do still have some time.
00:51:55.836 - 00:52:20.368, Speaker A: But I guarantee we're not going to get through everybody. But I'll stay on and talk to people who are still on the list. After that, if the other people giving feedback can't stay. So just be aware you might be stuck with me. Next up victor. Do you want to go ahead? Hello. Vitalik Buterin said he regrets that there are almost no ethereum salaries.
00:52:20.368 - 00:52:36.910, Speaker A: There is much money spent, much energy spent and no salaries for a common good. I did it. I make ethereum salaries. I will just show first. I'm sharing the screen. Wait, something wrong. I see.
00:52:36.910 - 00:53:02.476, Speaker A: You see? Yes. Do you see? Anyone can register for a salary just clicking this button and confirming. Then we can accept donations. Anyone can donate or bequest. Bequest is not yet done, but it is easy. So anyone can donate in Eg, et cetera. EC 20 donation amounts and donate.
00:53:02.476 - 00:53:33.180, Speaker A: It's very easy. The essence of the project is that it creates incentive for the market. Creates a market for calculating automatically the amounts of salaries. The amounts of salaries is calculated by traders. Traders and search engines are incentivized to collaborate and calculate it. It is done using a prediction market. I create a prediction market where future performance of works.
00:53:33.180 - 00:54:10.212, Speaker A: For example, for scientists it would be, for example, amounts of citations in the future. For example, direct and indirect citations. So a scientist might get a salary proportional to his rate or score. Everybody who registers get a rating or score. We can use different words in the future. Rating prediction market predicts this rating and gives him a salary. In conditional tokens.
00:54:10.212 - 00:54:54.310, Speaker A: It is in fact money transferred from the future. Mathematically, it's equivalent to money transfer from the future given certain conditions, certain assumptions. So we lock money, for example, for 50 or even 100 years and gather donations in the future and transfer money from the future to pay salaries to these people who work. It is future oriented. It is about the future performance of work, not about current performance. For example, if a student is very promising, he gets the same amount of money as a noble laureate. There are many subtleties and details in this project, but I have set of everything.
00:54:54.310 - 00:55:21.648, Speaker A: In fact, I have almost this UT an MVP. I submitted draft pull request to Gitcoin. It is almost an MVP. Just contracts are not audited and not enough tested. So we get fair and ethereum salaries, transfers from the future. We get much money because we collect money in the future. 100 years or so.
00:55:21.648 - 00:55:47.800, Speaker A: Great. Wow. I think that might be the biggest vision for a hackathon project designing 100 years out. I'll let other people respond first though. I like the idea. I think it's nice to see. I think the only platform right now which has seen common good funding is Gitcoin.
00:55:47.800 - 00:56:31.124, Speaker A: There's also been a lot of traction within crypto seeing good. You have quite a few protocols which are now diverting a portion of the revenues for common good funding as such. And there's been quite a few talks about quadrating funding and stuff. I like the idea of having a prediction market for the salary. I'm not sure how like a prediction market only works when there is enough people using it to be there. And I think it would be one good way to think on how to jumpstart that. But I like the idea of building a tool for common good funding as such.
00:56:31.124 - 00:57:04.880, Speaker A: So it's pretty cool. I forgot to say that I welcome the community to review the main contract of the project. It's ready. But for example today I added additional feature. Now it accepts defy tokens together with all their profits. For example, we can accept how it's called token and all its profits in donation or in Bequest. It can accept not only donations, but also bequests.
00:57:04.880 - 00:57:38.456, Speaker A: Because we transfer money from refugee it's possible to select a date and time. This particular feature does not work. Now after 20 years all my money becomes transferred, can be transferred to the project. Because they are transferred from the future. It's not very important whether it's donated or requested. So we will get much more donations. I have also this idea it's somehow dangerous.
00:57:38.456 - 00:58:19.364, Speaker A: I don't know if I should propose it officially because it creates a danger. It might lead to a fork of ethereum network. Am I proposed to transfer miners fees, share of miners fees directly to the smart contract which does this common good things. After all, the ethereum is created exactly to make common goods and just need a fair way to distribute salaries. And it is the most fair way that the market can do so. Scientists now your free software developers. The scientists worked with centralized organizations like universities.
00:58:19.364 - 00:58:44.816, Speaker A: Now the market will decide. I can tell my personal story if you want. It's a funny but very scary story. Or you decide trent, do I tell or not? I would love to hear it, but maybe in the discord, maybe write it out and then we can comment on your personal story there. Not now. Yeah, not now. Just because we're running short on time.
00:58:44.816 - 00:59:22.188, Speaker A: Yeah, we're running a bit short on time. I'll just have some quick feedback I think it's interesting concept. The problem with common goods funding is that generally people are capitalist and want to make money. So it's a bit hard to donate or bequest a lot of the time. So one way is something like people deposit funds into something like Aave and the interest that is earned is donated. So that's another way that your model might also work. And the bequesting thing, I like the idea of the bequesting thing.
00:59:22.188 - 00:59:49.780, Speaker A: That's good as well. It supports bequesting, DeFi tokens and getting all their future profits. Yeah, but what if I only want to give the interest but not the principal amount? The token is donated. Now the token is on my contract. It is in form of ERC, one five token. But that's not important. We can donate any kind of token through a wrapper.
00:59:49.780 - 01:00:10.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I understand that concept. Something to think about is that sometimes people have trouble donating. So instead of donating the full amount, maybe they can donate their interest stream. Only that may be done. Already done. The contract is written. It's only to audit it, only to test and audit it.
01:00:10.604 - 01:00:58.940, Speaker A: The next token appears on my contract. Then the DeFi provider adds another token to my contract. Then anybody can call a method, a function that donates from the contract to itself, that is the token which appears to the financial DeFi and interest. This token can be donated by anybody, can transfer from the contract to itself and make it an additional donation. So when somebody has ever donated DeFi tokens, then anybody can afterward use its interest to donate again. Okay, got it. Just while we wrap up.
01:00:58.940 - 01:01:24.900, Speaker A: Thanks for presenting that, Victor. One thing that I think would be good for this project and many others is some sort of diagram that explains the flow of funds over time. So that would be a good thing to have. When you wait a few seconds. This is an outdated site. You see the site, this is a diagram. Okay, perfect.
01:01:24.900 - 01:01:55.640, Speaker A: Yeah, diagrams are great because it's another way to help explain similar ideas. So I will have to take a look at this site after reward port. Not quite right. Okay, well then one thing you could do is maybe give us an updated version of this and that will help for your next pitch. Okay, I have a scientific article about this. It's now up to date. I have also submitted it to Gitcoin.
01:01:55.640 - 01:02:16.624, Speaker A: I have a pull request. Draft pull request? Oh, very good. Cool. I have also an independent independent of Gitcoin. But the main project is Gitcoin, not my independent DAP. Gitcoin has database, et cetera. My DAP doesn't.
01:02:16.624 - 01:02:42.110, Speaker A: So it's just more a demo. Gitcoin scene is real, it's useful. Okay, I think we're going to move on to the next project. But I want to hear your story either in the zoom chat or discord. Given we didn't have enough time to hear your personal story, but that would be good. Sorry. Should I call you? I don't understand.
01:02:42.110 - 01:03:00.912, Speaker A: No, you can just write it. Right. You said you wanted to share your personal story. Maybe in the discord would be better because this chat will go away. But thanks for presenting and I'll be in discord personally. Yeah, just DM me. That would be fine.
01:03:00.912 - 01:03:21.896, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm turning on the sound. All right, next up we're going to have Whiskey Coin. All right, great. So I'll jump in here. Thanks for having us. My name is Jasper and I'm working with my cousin Tillman and our family runs a craft distillery in the United States.
01:03:21.896 - 01:04:01.540, Speaker A: And actually, whiskey has some really interesting properties. When you age it, it's actually kind of like an interest bearing vehicle. So you put alcohol in a barrel and then as it matures, it legitimately just increases in value. And that's actually pretty easy to calculate. So you have instead of an interest bearing account, it's basically an interest bearing barrel, which is kind of fun. And so what we're thinking is there have been some whiskey funds that you could previously invest in, but those are really opaque and you don't actually know what you're investing in. You're just investing in these huge stockpiles of whiskey barrels and you have no visibility into what you're investing in and you typically don't even get the product.
01:04:01.540 - 01:04:49.524, Speaker A: You only get a share of some potential revenue that will be gained off the product. So what we wanted to do was actually think about how to connect whiskey enthusiasts directly to distilleries. So you can invest in specific barrels and then have a stake in the actual whiskey that's going to be maturing and increasing in value over time. So our idea is the distillery. Like, for instance, the distillery that our family runs would list a specific whiskey and investors could go and invest in this really stable product and you can pretty easily calculate how much return you're going to have on a specific barrel. So for us, let's say when we produce it, it costs around $35 a bottle initially. And then once you age it for three or four years, the return is up to 50, 60, $70.
01:04:49.524 - 01:05:40.032, Speaker A: And that's just kind of the primary market. But if you can create a token that represents kind of a bottle share of one of these barrels, then investors could come in, they could buy that, see the appreciation of the value of that token as well as maybe sell it on a secondary market. And maybe the value actually increases even more than it would have if just the distillery was selling it. Because it becomes a bit of a novelty item. But then the distillery would also basically back and insure that bottle for some base amount based off the return that it's going to have. So, for instance, if it was going to be $70 at the end, they insure it up to half of that value. So the investor would have a really stable investment where they could redeem the bottle for a set kind of return rate as well as paying some fees for the storage of the barrel or storage of the bottles.
01:05:40.032 - 01:06:58.480, Speaker A: And then Distilleries would get additional benefits for just marketing their product as well as allowing outside people to invest in their product and whiskey enthusiasts to kind of have a hand in supporting Distilleries directly. We would want to integrate with other platforms. What we're thinking is essentially if the distillery offers methods to basically buy back the bottles at certain prices, they could take and reserve those funds and put them into other interest bearing accounts, blockchain like integrate with Ave and put it into a different interest bearing account. So you get kind of double effect going there. What we'd like feedback on especially is maybe other ways to integrate with other lending platforms or other services out there that would increase the value of this product. But we would be really excited to have people, whiskey enthusiasts, be able to directly see what they're investing in and then eventually redeem those actual NFTs for the whiskey itself. And we know there are a lot of regulatory challenges, but we're looking into some of those and it seems like especially this would probably be a US exclusive product at the start because international shipping regulation with alcohol and spirits is not a fun thing to wait into.
01:06:58.480 - 01:07:37.230, Speaker A: But that's the general idea, just more transparency in what you're investing in and more benefit for the distillery themselves rather than these giant whiskey funds being these anonymous barrels that you actually don't ever get to have the whiskey. So that's why I'd love some feedback. Okay, cool. Very cool idea. My first point you already addressed, which is there's probably some regulations around this you're going to have to look into. It's probably some flavor of security because you're expecting your barrel management in your facility. It's the expectation of your activity that would cause the increase in value.
01:07:37.230 - 01:08:42.012, Speaker A: The other question is how would you handle is there a barrel inspector agency? Who's the Oracle in this case? So what we would do and how we would try to align the incentives is we would say, for instance, for one barrel, you would only have a certain percentage available for the public. So the distillery would own some and be invested in the quality of the product. I know you'd have to still trust the distillery to be invested in whatever share they have, but if it's 2030 40%, that is a significant investment from the distillery. So they'd want to ensure the quality of the product. There are a lot of whiskey clubs that are out there and they have some sort of administrator that they sample the barrels from time to time to make sure that there's no issues with the quality of the whiskey. So what we were thinking is you'd have just updates. From the distillery, or maybe even if it's a platform, some other third party members that would post updates as they do tastings.
01:08:42.012 - 01:09:38.130, Speaker A: Or even people that invest certain percentage of a barrel, like, let's say I own maybe 10% of this barrel, then I'm entitled to semiannual tastings of the barrel and quality controls. So offering incentives to have people invest more and to be more invested in a certain product that way. Yeah, I love the idea. I've seen another sort of example of this. I think someone in Argentina, they own a winery and did a similar thing and it seemed to work quite well for them. So, yeah, I'd buy this token even though I'm international and I'd speculate on it, but it would be cool if you could have some webcam hooked up and then for token holders can look in and watch their whiskey getting distilled. Exactly.
01:09:38.130 - 01:10:15.534, Speaker A: Some whiskey view. I think adding more components of making it variable for the token holders would be interesting. And then I think there would be a lot of speculative nature. I mean, just look at uni socks, what happened there. So it would be interesting even if you couldn't do international shipping for whiskey, even if you did socks or some other thing that sort of represents that, that might be cool. A great idea. And then from a more bigger, I guess, business perspective, because I've seen this idea a few times, it might be interesting to generalize this because maybe you're technical, you have a technical team.
01:10:15.534 - 01:11:00.094, Speaker A: Then maybe there's other distilleries or wineries or companies that want to do this because it's sort of like a kickstarter for this stuff, right? Essentially, yeah. And you could use the same model for you. Wineries breweries are especially popular now, so anything that has some bottling or aging period, it works really well. And it doesn't have to be so long term. Like whiskey is multiple years, but it also could work in a condensed time frame too. And we're thinking maybe another potential is to use it to gauge demand of different products. So if you're, for instance, a distillery or even a brewery, you could list several things and then people, whichever one gets the most initial interest and the most initial purchases, that's the one you make.
01:11:00.094 - 01:11:34.586, Speaker A: So people have power into actually choosing what gets made. I think also for the previous winery, one I've heard of, because it depends on the weather for wine. So certain years, you speculate on the year that whatever reason you think this year is going to be good or next year is going to be good. So maybe you could experiment around product lines like that as well. It's like, okay, we're going to do an experimental thing with this whiskey and add a bit more of this or store this in this sort of temperature. Exactly. In the whole interesting.
01:11:34.586 - 01:12:15.110, Speaker A: And the craft market, especially at this level, like, we're talking single barrel releases, you can get really creative, like a lot of distilleries. Now, for instance, you finish it in a wine barrel and then you get this sherry finish on a whiskey. So you can offer really unique products if you're at the barrel level rather than these warehouse level investments. Yeah, super interesting idea. I'll be curious to see what sort of things you end up submitting because obviously you guys are attaching this to a real business or you intend to. So that's a big vision. So it'll be interesting to see what you end up submitting.
01:12:15.110 - 01:12:56.094, Speaker A: Cool. Whiskey AirDrop already one interesting idea for you to explore. And that could be also would be that these whiskey tokens could also form collaterals in Aave and all right, they actually have real value and they're more solid. So that would be a very good if you could integrate within the DeFi space as collaterals, accepted collaterals within the money markets in DeFi. Right. That would create and value premium value to the added value to over the whiskey value as such. All right, cheers.
01:12:56.094 - 01:13:48.542, Speaker A: Thank you all so much. Thanks for sharing. We're going to move on to Zenbit, which is Habakkuk Vera. Hi guys, I'm Habakkuk from Zenbit. We are developing Aztec Gamified onboarding solution for Ethereum newcomers that helps players to develop digital skills while interacting with NFTs and MetaMask interactions in a point a click adventure. It worked with Crypto collectibles Minted on NFTs, where every item has a function inside the game from moving to attacking and claiming rewards from our test token. To use these tools, users must hat the NFTs on their wallets and must learn how to sync transactions, check gas fees, use Block Explorer or Burn tokens.
01:13:48.542 - 01:14:56.918, Speaker A: In this way, we are planning to reach newcomers in Mexico and Latin America since financial and digital gaps keep most people away from these tools. So, this is the main idea. Is this going to be on mainnet or a side chain like Matic or something like that? Well, for now, we have minted some NFTs on the main net and also for us, it's now a time for learning. So we deploy a test token on the main net because, well, it's a way for us to learn how the Terrierium virtual machine actually works. But we are not planning to use this for commercial purposes. We actually want to learn other users to use the Ethereum virtual machine. And in using NFTs, we are finding that it's easier for people to understand what they are doing on the platforms.
01:14:56.918 - 01:16:18.542, Speaker A: So well, in this way we are for now planning to use react and MetaMask and probably for further implementations or a token that could be audited and working in a proper way. We start on the testnet and then deploy on the main net. But for now we are trying to explore and know our capabilities on the main net. I guess I don't know the full scope of what you're building. But do you need to interact with mainnet protocols or is your goal to just get people familiar with interacting with a blockchain generally? Well, we plan to use the NFTs as funding way for a startup. So the NFTs are minted on the mainland for this reason. But the purpose of the project is to learn other users here in Mexico how to interact with blockchain, how to learn the Ethereum interactions, how to check the gas fees.
01:16:18.542 - 01:17:10.980, Speaker A: That is kind of the main barriers for new users to start using Ethereum protocols. I think the guidance you can give us will be very valuable for us. Yeah, I guess maybe I just didn't hear it or I'm not understanding if this is an educational venture but you also have some NFTs which are tied to it. Are the NFTs the reward. Or if it's just an educational thing this could all happen off chain, right? Or on a side chain. One of the big problems that any project that's onboarding new fresh users is like you said, they're not used to gas fees, they don't understand what all this stuff is. They're used to web two.
01:17:10.980 - 01:17:48.458, Speaker A: So if you're just trying to educate them couldn't this occur off chain or on a side chain or layer two? Great. Definitely something to consider. One of the projects you might be interested in looking at is called Rabbit Hole GG. They do something similar if you've heard of them. It's like campaigns with Ave and a couple other projects where they get people to interact with the protocols and then they earn XP. Sort of similar to what you're doing. Maybe you can get some good suggestions from them.
01:17:48.458 - 01:18:41.890, Speaker A: Good, thank you. Education is a good space. I think another idea that I've seen is if you have people pay something upfront if they're capable of and then you pull that money into something like Ave so it gains interest and by the time they finish whatever the course is, maybe they're able to withdraw a bit more than they put in. So there's an incentive for them to finish the educational course but also there's a financial benefit for them. Actually, we try to gamify this educational part. So it's an experimental game, it's a point and click adventure working with NFDS. So the NFDS are tools working inside the game that could help users to claim tokens or sign transactions.
01:18:41.890 - 01:20:40.966, Speaker A: I understand the limitations that we are must be using the test net first but understanding these transactions or understanding how the main net works I think it's interesting for us probably not to get users to buy the NFTs but to give them the NFTs and then they start to use the main net. Well, I understand that the NFTs could be a variable interest capabilities connected with Abe so we are on the early stage but probably in the time frame of the hackathon for our capabilities probably will be limited to implement abe but definitely. It's a point that we want to explore that probably give an NFT that could be gaining interest from vault and in that way get more familiarities for new users on this more complex protocol. Yeah, got it. Thank you. Yeah, if I can give some feedback, is like for the final pitch, better if you are specific on exactly what you build. Because for example, from my perspective, I felt that there were a lot of brainstorming on your side, like multiple ideas related with education, with NFT, with funding, but it was not really clear what you are building.
01:20:40.966 - 01:21:31.158, Speaker A: So better if you, for example, if you center on the educational part and trying to teach people about blockchain in general. Just center the pitch on that. I think it will be useful. Well, we will focus on gamify this experience, this educational experience, but I understand that maybe we must work on how to communicate the idea to be clearer and I hope that the DAP or the work on this hackathon could help to get a more clear visual idea how this can be working. That sounds great. Thank you. Sasha, do you have anything? If not, we can move on.
01:21:31.158 - 01:21:48.186, Speaker A: No. Thank you for the feedback. I look forward to seeing the UI. I think that would be easier to visualize what they're building. Right, sorry. He said he's looking forward to seeing the UI. It will make it easier to visualize.
01:21:48.186 - 01:22:10.386, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much. All right, great. So we're down to the last few minutes. Where David? I know David has to leave Ernesto Shaisav. I just want to thank you all for spending the last hour and a half with us. We're going to try to get through one more really quick and then I think they probably have some other things to get to.
01:22:10.386 - 01:23:40.374, Speaker A: But I will stick around and not going to claim to be able to give the same caliber of feedback, but I will be happy to listen to any and all pitches for however long it takes to get through everybody. So thank you again to you three. And we're going to do one more quick one and that would be Sake credit score for lending platforms. Hi everyone, can you hear me? Yes, I am Igor from Sake and we're working on building on Ave's credit delegation feature by introducing under collateralized loans to the community through a credit score system. And we're actually thinking about approaching it in several ways and we wanted your input on what you think would be the more interesting route to take. So one of the directions was to analyze the user addresses borrowing history by checking the lending platform history and updating it over time with the graph as they interact with more protocols. So if you are taking out loans on, say, Ave and you're paying them back on time and we see that you are building up a good consistent history, then we slowly increase your token balance.
01:23:40.374 - 01:24:42.280, Speaker A: But as you maybe do some things that would be considered something that a bad actor might do or something that would be higher risk, then we would adjust it lower. And I have my friend Oscar that will describe to you the other side of it. Hey everybody, my name is Oscar. Basically the other idea is to use a sort of a token that would be staked every time you get a loan. And the process of decreasing or increasing your loan would occur inside the contract of the loan itself. So if you had a good payment, your tokens will get a boost. Versus if you actually pay like late or you don't actually pay, your tokens will get a decrease or actually stop existing basically.
01:24:42.280 - 01:25:31.090, Speaker A: So one is more simplistic, the other one would be more advanced. Let's say like that. We're still debating basically we came out with the idea of scanning the history yesterday, last night, so we're still thinking on it. We're also not really sure how to integrate Ave here. We wonder if we create a protocol like Ave is able to just say okay, our lending pool contract can be modified to actually absorb your guys idea. I think you mentioned credit delegation, right? Oh yes, credit delegation, yes, credit delegation is enough. That's ave feature.
01:25:31.090 - 01:26:13.134, Speaker A: So yeah, that sounds really good. Just my quick feedback. Yeah, I think it's really good. Maybe you can try and combine those two aspects. I mean the more information you can take into account, the less risky it will be for the lenders. One thing I've seen in the market is that you can start with collateralized loans for certain lenders and then as they pay back those loans, you slowly reduce the collateral that is needed. Then eventually it becomes under collateralized and then eventually it becomes no collateral.
01:26:13.134 - 01:27:16.706, Speaker A: So that could be another model where they essentially build a profile with your platform. Yeah, that's what we were thinking about through the credit score system. Yeah, that's exactly the route we were thinking. Like start with let's say zero point 75 x's of your collateral and basically the tokens or your credit score will be able to buy you leverage on your collateral. Yeah, I think that's a good approach if I can give you a bit more technical or economic advice is that you need to be aware that for example, if you integrate this system in Abbey and you want to monitor repayments like you say that repayment is a good action. It's not so simple sometimes to identify if it's a repayment or not. So you will need to be really aware if the person is doing for example, borrowing and then repaying and then borrowing and then repaying.
01:27:16.706 - 01:27:45.182, Speaker A: So it's just increasing his profile, those kind of tricks which in blockchain sometimes is a bit difficult to control. And also how this will be optimal in terms of execution. Like if it will be expensive or not. Because if you need to spend gas for every action to increase or decrease the credit score, it could be problematic. Sure. Yeah. That's what we're thinking.
01:27:45.182 - 01:28:36.282, Speaker A: Basically maybe the more simplistic way where your contract in each loan actually takes care of the increasing or decreasing of the score we work because it will be less expensive. Right. And we were actually thinking like what you say is actually true. A person can just ask for a loan and then repay the first day, get a boost, and then do the same the next day and we have a huge increase on their credit score. Right. So we're thinking more like depending on how long you stayed on the loan and paid interest, that's how you would boost your credit score, basically. Like, how much interest did you pay and in proportion of that, you will get an increase on your credit score.
01:28:36.282 - 01:29:19.994, Speaker A: Basically. I was going to say, would this work? Anesthet as long as they have an abstraction on top of, say, Aave, so all their users interact with abstraction, so then they know exactly which events valid repays and maybe they could have enforce that. You can't just go borrow, repay, borrow, repay. You have to have the borrow for at least a certain period of time. Yeah, I mean, if you involve time and you have installments of repaying the loan, even doing some product with fully fixed interest, at that point, it's a bit more solid, for sure. I agree. Thank you guys.
01:29:19.994 - 01:29:45.426, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you very much for your input. So I actually see what you guys are building as two separate components. As such, one is the credit score and one is the lending. And it's not necessarily connected like the credit score. If you build a good credit score, it could be used by Aave or any other protocol. So there is the need of credit score within DeFi as such to enable under collateralized loan.
01:29:45.426 - 01:30:15.914, Speaker A: Right. Till now, there is not successfully large scale deployment of a great scope. I like the idea that you guys want to pick on chain data and use that to score users. Right. I just wonder what would be so I think initially it was mentioned that the idea is that there'll be some bad actions. Right. I think it would be good to identify what are these bad actions which could reduce your credit score.
01:30:15.914 - 01:31:17.634, Speaker A: Because right now, if you take any on chain data, right, that if say if it's from compound or if it's from Ave, all of them are over collateralized loans. So everyone's paying back because there's a higher value locked in the contract and there's a penalty if he gets liquidated. Right. So every be a good borrower, I would think, right? Like what is a bad borrower in the current system where everyone's so collateralized? Yeah, and I guess that's our question as well. We kind of don't know where exactly to focus. Like do we build this credit score for the existing system or do we create like a sandbox where it can be used, where we can tally it up maybe more effectively? But yeah, you are correct that we need to provide some sort of a system for the existing systems over collateralized loan process. Yeah, but I think credit score as a segment to build something in it and solve the problem.
01:31:17.634 - 01:32:05.490, Speaker A: It's a big problem that needs solving. So in that, the good thing is you guys have taken a big challenge, right? So that's the good part, right? And hackathons are the best time to try these challenges, right? Instead of trying solving small problems, trying to take a big challenge. So it's good to see what you guys will build, but I think it's a very interesting area to work and try solve. Thank you. Thank you. And with that, we are going to wrap up the official feedback session with David, Ernesto and Seisha. I want to thank them again for giving their time and their accumulated expertise to give feedback to all the hackers.
01:32:05.490 - 01:32:27.274, Speaker A: Like I said, I will be sticking around. So if anybody wants just general feedback on your pitch or just chat about your idea, I will continue on in this stream. But we will let David, Ernesto and Sasha go if they have to. Bye, guys. Really. Thanks everyone. Yeah, really good.
01:32:27.274 - 01:33:04.262, Speaker A: Also, feel free to post in the Ave sponsor channel and then we can comment there as well later on if you want. And thanks to for being an amazing host. Of course. Thank you guys. All right, so next up was did you lab? We'll see who sticks around to get my feedback again, everybody's not obligated to stay. If they were looking for specific feedback from people, that's totally fine. You can always hit them up in discord as well.
01:33:04.262 - 01:33:34.186, Speaker A: But we're going to keep on trucking until we run out of people. Is the DigiLab team here? Yeah. Hello. Hey, how's it going? Hello. My name is Bogdan Siewesk and I represent DGU lab team from Nova Sibersk. And I want to tell you about our project. Crosschain Dex pool.
01:33:34.186 - 01:34:19.310, Speaker A: So we are going to build Crosschain decentralized exchange and with MultiChain liquidity pool. And now I will tell you what the problem are we going to solve now? We have that I didn't share screen. Sorry. So I'm sorry. One moment please. So we are building Dex Pool. Now, everybody knows that there are a lot of different blockchains online, okay.
01:34:19.310 - 01:36:26.706, Speaker A: There is ethereum, a lot of other networks, and all of them are separated and there is a lot of liquidity blocked, especially in ethereum and also in other pools. And also we figured out that there is a big need for some people to use liquidity from one chain, to use it on another and to make it quick. So the problem that we are solving is poor user experience. Liquidity blocked in chains of truly decentralized exchanges because for example binance smart chain, okay, it's really good, it has a lot of millions of users but actually everybody have to trust some party binance so okay, it's working but we are trying to build decentralized world. Okay, so the next slide what is our solution? We we try to use production ready solutions to integrate chains it's chain link, we can read data in our smart contracts from another chain using chain link, external adapter and another feature of our project is what we achieve when we connect different blockchains together. Okay, what we achieve the main thing we achieve the liquidity liquidity free from being locked in different places. So we build MultiChain liquidity pool.
01:36:26.706 - 01:38:15.162, Speaker A: We read data and we can change state of smart contracts in another pool, in another chains. And also to make good user experience, we adopted MetaMask to connect to different chains at the same time. On the next slide, I want to show you a little bit technical details on how is our system built. So in the center we have chain link network, we have external adapters being connected on both directions from one chain and to another. For example from Ethereum to binance smart chain and other direction we have main smart contracts, dex pool, we can swap tokens, we can add liquidity, we can add any asset from ethereum to this liquidity pool. And also the user can what I didn't say very important thing that the user can for example provide the assets for example USDT from ethereum network and he want to get for example BNB from benign smart chain and our system can achieve it. So this slide shows smart contracts and how they communicate with networks and each other.
01:38:15.162 - 01:40:13.550, Speaker A: Okay? And I represent our company DGU great, so my first question is what is the actual substrate that you're building this on? Is it living just on Ethereum? And then you have something relaying calls between chains or is it something like Cosmos where you're sitting in between chains? For now we are building one side is Binance smart chain and other side is actually our system that was on the slide. There is chain link node there is some script on chain link node called external adapter. It can connect to external chain to read data and to change state. And we can call this external adapter from our smart contract. So the only thing we have is we have front end, we have some code on chainlink node and we have two blockchain networks that's it. We do not have backend. Okay, what are the trust assumptions here? Are you the only chainlink node that's providing this bespoke data or would you try to get a bunch of different chain links? This is next step of our plan that we want to provide our adapter we will publish it on chainlink market and anybody can use it.
01:40:13.550 - 01:41:05.200, Speaker A: There is some technical problems how to do it but we will do it. And any participant in the future, he can use our adapter, run it on his own chain link node. So we want the system to be really decentralized. We do not want to provide service of chain link adapters. Sure, that makes sense. And the big vision, the big picture goal is to integrate as many chains as possible. Or do you have a limit on how many chains? This is our look in the future that of course we want to integrate as much as possible, but this is only our first step.
01:41:05.200 - 01:41:40.540, Speaker A: Sure, yeah, of course. It's pretty big for a hackathon to make a cross chain swap project like this. I don't have anything specific other than that, but I think I have a good understanding of what you are building and it'll be interesting to see what happens over the next few weeks. Okay, thank you very much. Baris did you want to add something? Boris no. Okay, that's good. Great.
01:41:40.540 - 01:42:38.240, Speaker A: So what do you hope to submit by the end of the hackathon? I think in the end of the hackathon we will submit a token. A token? A liquidity pool that will that will have a structure of token. And I think we will submit the exchange of one token from any one token from one chain to any token from another. I mean, some minimum functionality. Yeah, we swap different tokens by other blockchain, like uniswap. Yeah, that would be a pretty big accomplishment. So I'm looking forward to it.
01:42:38.240 - 01:43:09.558, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Thank you for presenting. Next is I don't know if Derek is still here. Derek, do you want to share what you're working on? Three, two, one. Looks like a lot of people have dropped off, but that's okay. Next up is Porgy. Yes, we're here.
01:43:09.558 - 01:43:36.000, Speaker A: We have waited for a chance to help. Hey, go ahead. Yeah. Share what you're working. Sure. So, yeah, in Porgi, we have basically looked into the ideas of what has been presented by the whole community and we have came up with the idea of continuous coin offering. The idea is that we want to build a more robust and engaging model in comparison to what the current ICO provides to the blockchain community.
01:43:36.000 - 01:44:54.418, Speaker A: The plan lies in locking up the investments and releasing the investments batch by voting on project achievements for a milestone. So let's say right now we have a project for a season of one year. And, yeah, we have a fundraising that is divided to four quarters and we are releasing every quarter after we have voted, like the whole community have voted for the project to continue or to basically reject the project after the achievements have been presented. And yeah, the locked portions which are left are basically being lent on the ave market. So it basically creates two incentives for those who are interested in the project to gain some interest and as well as have the token and to participate in the movement of the project. This is how we want to do so. Yeah, as a background, I just want to say that firstly, it is unfortunate that the ICO popularity is going down and the ICO is basically providing a big roadmap.
01:44:54.418 - 01:46:02.010, Speaker A: It's like a waterfall kind of development thing. And what we want is to get back to the roots of such guys as YC or 500 Startups, where you present the idea and you want everybody who has the Internet to engage with you and they can tell you as the first 100 fans what is okay and what can be rejected. So, yeah, this is what we want to present it's like for the hackathon is to make some kind of a UI where we show how it is so easy to actually be an angel investor in no regards of how much you own or you have just yet to participate and to vote. Gotcha. Yeah, I mean, I totally agree that the ICO boom, it's a lot of issues. So seeing different models is definitely good to have options for projects that are launching. One thing you might want to look at, maybe you've come across it in your research, is called a dico DAICO, and it has some similar mechanisms.
01:46:02.010 - 01:46:36.538, Speaker A: The article I linked in the chat is from last year, but I think this has been around for at least two years now. Actually, I think Vitalik came with the original idea after 2017, maybe 2018, similar idea to what you're describing. So maybe you can pull some of those concepts from there and integrate them where there are checkpoints that you want to reach and then it unlocks tranches. Yeah, I think it's a great idea. Thank you. I don't want to stop the next ones. Yeah.
01:46:36.538 - 01:46:56.800, Speaker A: One question is are you making your own contracts or are you going to build on somebody else's contracts? We want to make our own contracts. Okay. And yeah, this is just the vanilla solidity and some front end. Cool. I'm excited. Better models or more models is always better. Thanks.
01:46:56.800 - 01:47:21.314, Speaker A: Thanks for presenting Winvoy. Where you at? I'm here. He's here. Go ahead. Hi everyone. My name is Neo and I'm half of winvoy the Winvoy team. And what we want to build is a tool to help companies get access to invoice finance, on demand and selective.
01:47:21.314 - 01:48:21.286, Speaker A: So basically what we want to do is get the credit from Ave and then delegate it to our users based on different criteria. So there would be four different participants in this scenario. Let's say small company called Agme Limited would be selling to other companies and they would be using Winvoy to request payments, create invoices, get access to invoice finance, et cetera. There would be a second participant, big company, which is Agme's client, and they tend to request their vendors to invoice them in net 90, which basically has some pretty big effect on the cash flow for. Agme and smaller companies then ourselves, Winvoy, so basically helping them manage all the account receivables and the on demand selective invoice financing. And then Ave as the liquidity provider in this case. And we're looking at two main flows.
01:48:21.286 - 01:49:18.678, Speaker A: So the main one, which would be as well what we will submit hopefully by the end of the hackathon, which is first flow would be Winvoy sorry, a user onboarding a client within Winvoy for the first time. So let's say Acme Limited inputs big company as a client in Winvoy. Winvoy would basically check big companies credit score with a credit oracle or maybe off chain. We have to figure out how to do that. And then Winvoy would see that this big company is, let's say in this case low risk. Winvoy then would go and check Ave's lending rates. And with this information Winvoy would give Acme Limited an estimate that every invoice issued to this big company will cost around let's say 2% per month to advance.
01:49:18.678 - 01:50:35.350, Speaker A: So an example, now the second flow, the second main flow would be when Acme actually requests a payment from the big company. In this case they let's say request a payment for 100,000 USD with Winvoy, they set up the payment request and they offer the potential to pay immediately with a 5% discount or they offer the option to pay in 90 days as the big company is requesting. Now the big company is going to receive the payment request and will most likely, let's say in this case, select the option to pay 90 days. At that point Winvoy will check again Avis rates just in case they haven't changed. Also the risk score for this company will make a decision and will basically come back to Agme saying hey, your client has decided to pay you in 90 days. With this invoice we can offer you to get the money immediately at a 2% per month fee which is equivalent to 24% Apr. So Agmay in this case let's say, says okay, we want the advance, we want the money right now.
01:50:35.350 - 01:52:15.000, Speaker A: So they would get the 94,000 USD, which is 100,000 minus the 2% a month times three months these 90 days on the terms that will trigger Winvoy borrowing from abe this 94,000 and depositing the funds in Agnes, in Agnes account. And 90 days later when the big company pays back the 100,000 USD through Winvoy, 94,000 of this USD plus the fees would go to repay the loan on Ave and Winboy would be basically generating around 4K USD in fees for Winboy. Now you might have a question like why would we use Ave's funds if we have the funds ourselves to pay for that collateral. And the main idea is that we're basically trying to prove the concept of this working and then we will after the hackathon, explore different options. One is that we're thinking about potentially crowdsourcing the collateral from other investors and then sharing the fees that win Voyerns with them. Another option could be potentially speaking with Ave and maybe by providing some sort of insurance or very rock solid credit scoring, reduce the need for collateral. That's probably a long shot, but we'll see.
01:52:15.000 - 01:52:57.838, Speaker A: And the other one could be potentially creating our own liquidity pools and protocol so that we can just use Ave to serve peaks of demand. So basically have some sort of like load balancing. So, yeah, that's winboy. Very cool. Yeah. I linked one project which has done something similar, centrifuge, maybe you're familiar with it. But the tokenizing invoices is, I think, something that blockchain is uniquely suited for because it gets everybody on the same back end, basically, and they don't have to worry about integrating with other enterprise systems that have different requirements, different licenses.
01:52:57.838 - 01:53:46.114, Speaker A: So this is perfect. And the thing I haven't seen before with these invoicing or tokenizing invoice systems is a credit score, which would be very interesting because it's just another way to evaluate the risk of whoever's participating in this market. One question is, Ave only does variable rate loans right now, right. On v two, they have a stable though they might I'm asking yeah. If they have a stable rate. That's good. That's very good, because obviously if you're lending or you're withdrawing capital from Ave, you don't want it to spike up to 70% and that kind of ruins your that'll ruin your calculations, but cool.
01:53:46.114 - 01:54:39.278, Speaker A: I really like the idea. What's your background? Do you come from anything related to this, or is it just something that you came across and thought it was a good idea? A mix of the two? So my background is in Fintech. I used to be head of product at a different company, Fintech, in London, and was B, two C. But we started, me and my co founder basically started checking the market and doing market research and saw that this is a real need, especially for small and medium companies. Right? Yeah. These smaller companies are kind of at the mercy of the days, you know, and they need that liquidity now to pay suppliers or it's definitely a problem that I've heard come up frequently. I don't know if I have any other specific feedback, but definitely check out Tin Lake from Centrifuge.
01:54:39.278 - 01:54:56.406, Speaker A: I put the link in the chat and maybe you'll be able to get some inspiration there or some other features to include. Sounds good. Cool. Thank you. Thanks for presenting. Yes. All right, my error is I think I skipped over Derek.
01:54:56.406 - 01:55:55.418, Speaker A: So Derek, if you want to present now, you can go. Yo, what's up, hackers worldwide? How's it going, man? Thanks, Trent, for putting me back up on the list. Unfortunately, the Internet fell, but okay, so what I'm hacking on this hackathon is using the Ave government contract. So I forked that up. And Ernesto was talking about how you can use tokens to be like, the key entry into the contract. So I can actually pull in a token that already exists in the main net or on Maddox, Mainet and use that to be like a key entry. So to make things a little bit more fun, I'm trying to hack an ERC 721 and ERC 20 as the key entry points.
01:55:55.418 - 01:56:56.138, Speaker A: So if you want to be part of voting up on, I don't know, different things and making changes to the system or appointing anything you can do with voting on the Ave government, we would be actually using these two tokens instead of Ave and Ave Stake. And on top of that, I just want to maybe talk maybe during the hack, like during the hackathon talk a little bit more with the Ave guys and see what else I can go forking up and just reuse that and try to pull more good things into this project. So basically how my hack is happening is I create an ERC 721. I use JSON. RPC. To centralize these IDs. I wish they could be totally decentralized, but we actually need to make this KYC and KYC is a little bit punkish.
01:56:56.138 - 01:57:28.026, Speaker A: It's very hard just to KYC through computer and if the computer can access all of that and I'm hacking solo. So I was actually thinking of using this Terra ID to actually make it into a centralized decentralized system so the person has it, it's with him. Maybe I can share and just show you where I'm at right now. Yay, let's hack together. Hacky guys. I really do hope everybody's okay. I live like in the middle of the rainforest and man, we're having serious problems here.
01:57:28.026 - 01:57:52.542, Speaker A: A lot of people are a lot of health and blessings. Okay. So tested on openc. So ERC 70 21 is totally coming up and this is pretty cool. And then I made another contract. This is actually the beta one. I made a gamma one and I experimented sending it to my MetaMask in my wallet, in my rinkabee wallet.
01:57:52.542 - 01:59:03.046, Speaker A: So I don't know if you guys see me or if you guys only see my Share screen, but right now actually on MetaMask do you guys see this? Do you guys see my screen? So this is pretty cool because where I live in Brazil, it's the second country that's most hacked in the so like we lose millions and millions and millions of real money and a lot of people are losing their money and the people that actually lose this money are unprotected by service and unprotected by real authentication. So I just want to make this just start paving a road into something better. These are ERC 720 ones are corresponding to MetaMask and they're perfectly good. So I already have an ERC. 20 deployed on Mainet. So I just want to join both of this and the ERC 20 as an entry point into governance and use that to actually start decentralizing my city and decentralizing my people. Into? I don't know, industrial Revolution 6.0
01:59:03.046 - 01:59:35.086, Speaker A: and 5.0. So basically that's my hack. What I was going to do, just going to use the Fork Governance and start working on top of this, just changing it up and doing things through here because I really don't have a team. So I'm just going to use what I can. If you have a samurai sword, you use your samurai sword. If you have an entire army, use your entire army. So I'm just the guy with a katana.
01:59:35.086 - 02:00:35.240, Speaker A: I'm going to use this katana to actually be hacking on right here on Contract. That's what Ernesto explained right here on governance strategy. So basically we're pulling up this address and the constructor, address Abbey and Address Stake. I'm just going to be changing these to the Rinkbeat test nets and I'm going to start testing it out, see if the Governance, after it's compiled and deployed, is going to be working with the ERC 721 as an entry point. Probably going to have to just study this a little bit because it's not a transfer call. So if we pull up the interface, you see it's total supply balanced off. So I'm going to have to hack a little bit this and just see how I interface this of the ERC 721 so that these can be the main entry points into the Governance system.
02:00:35.240 - 02:01:27.750, Speaker A: Another thing that I want to do is just by using the stereo ID, since the Governance is using Powers, he explained it quite well. So I can have 1000 ERC 20 tokens, stera tokens, 1000 reforested trees, but I can have three documents of terra ID. Like, I have my ID, I have my driver's ID. So the more you KYC yourself into the system, the more ERC 720 ones you deploy into the system. The more regulated and transparent you are, the better. And in case you lose your documents, since it's a centralized place, I can just go back into the back here and in the shop or in the store or in the I don't know. I was thinking, like, a little booth in the shopping mall where we can start.
02:01:27.750 - 02:02:14.910, Speaker A: Just making the people here more transparent. Because this is a real big problem. So if somebody loses, I can just rebound here and I just erase it up. So even if the bandit actually gets all of their documents, I can just create a new ID and an image gateway like Negate. It this ID is Negated and I know it's centralized, but when we're talking about documents and things like that, I don't think we'll ever actually get to a totally decentralized thing with documents. That's where my hack is right now. So we can pull this info, we can pull the info from the ERC 20 and I want to mix it up and finance in it and just study a little bit more of Ave.
02:02:14.910 - 02:02:38.220, Speaker A: Just study a little bit more of Ave and see what else I can incur it into this project and about it. I think. Trent. Hey. Yeah, sorry, I just stopped your sharing because your audio was cutting out, but yeah. So if I were to summarize, you are building an identity system based on the Aave governance contract? Yeah. Cool.
02:02:38.220 - 02:03:15.014, Speaker A: And all of the IDs are actually the more KYC you put into I want an ID. Okay, so now I want a lawyer's ID. So there are different documents in Brazil that brazil is totally bureaucratic. If you want to do something, it takes one year to actually regulate one crypto here, maybe two years. So it took like, almost a year and a half to actually regulate my crypto here. So for documents, the same shit, if you want to get a driver's license, it's like a three month process. This is already you having one.
02:03:15.014 - 02:04:02.678, Speaker A: You just want to remit one or remit a new one. So it's very complicated. So what happens is, since you're having the power of your documents, you already have voting power. And with voting power and some ERC 20, if you have both of these, you already have enough voting power to participate. And we can centralize it in a forum so people can be giving their opinions and in a decentralized way, we can create proposals for voting. Now, there is one problem. I haven't tested it all the way, so maybe when people start voting, people can go into the ether scan, see who's voting for, and maybe pull the breadcrumbs back up to find who that person is.
02:04:02.678 - 02:04:46.280, Speaker A: So to make things a little bit more interesting, I'm thinking that I'm not going to put the entire ID number. I'm just going to put the last four or five digits and explain to him, look, this is just an extra layer of security. Or I don't know. Or I just put the entire number and I just say, look, this is an extra layer of security. Every time you're going to do something in Brazil, you can show your ID, you can show your CPF, you can show all of your documents, or you can just pull up your iPhone. And actually, to regulate this in Brazil, we would have to go to Congress to approve of this kind of application. But it's a really good step so that we can try testing it out on people here in my city and just see how things go.
02:04:46.280 - 02:05:30.642, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what sort of engagement you get. I'm definitely interested to see that. So what's your opinion about this? What do you think I should work on? What do you think I should go to? I don't know if I see this scaling super huge, given it's a manual system that you're operating, but it could be interesting for smaller scale identity and voting systems, for sure. I was thinking of organizing it. Okay, so let's say that I make this into a business. It would be kind of like people. One is the designer, just like you would do a normal ID.
02:05:30.642 - 02:06:11.602, Speaker A: When you go take off your ID, there's actually like four or five desks that you move in through. Give me your documents. Okay. The designer is already taking your picture and putting it on the Terra ID or something like that. And then the other person is already hacking it on GitHub because this is made on GitHub after all that is done. Sorry, guys, I'm kind of sick. So, on the fourth desk, he would actually pay for the purchase of the ERC 721, and then it would need it to be centralized and decentralized at the same time.
02:06:11.602 - 02:07:01.214, Speaker A: So he would have his things in his phone. That would just be an extra layer of identity. Um, I think one thing that I mentioned to other projects is it would be good to see a diagram of how you see the user flow or the trust assumptions throughout this. Just get a bigger holistic picture of what you're actually building. But, yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing more next week. It's because I'm still jointly that's where I'm right now as a physical, how we would sell this to people in a booth in the shopping mall or something like that. I haven't done the entire flow, but I'll have to do it for the hackathon.
02:07:01.214 - 02:07:16.722, Speaker A: Of course I'll have to do that because I think it's interesting as well. Master. Yeah. All right, thanks for sharing. We're going to move on to the next project, though. Thank you. That would be Ryan Snyder.
02:07:16.722 - 02:07:38.580, Speaker A: Are you here? I do not hear Ryan. So we're going to go to the next one, which is Flash daddies. Yeah. Hey, Trent. How's it going? Tom? Yeah, good, thanks. Cheers for hanging on. Really appreciate it.
02:07:38.580 - 02:08:23.972, Speaker A: Of course. Anything for the hackers. Go ahead, man. Cool. The team that I'm with, we had an idea to in lieu of actually preventing front runners, which are pretty bad thing that's happening at the moment, we'd have to cooperate with an exchange and have some encrypted transactions, and it's pretty tricky. So we thought instead of that, we would detect front runs and award the addresses that did the front run with some sort of token to kind of highlight or to take the mic, basically. And then the person who did the original transaction, they would get kind of the opposite token to that.
02:08:23.972 - 02:09:02.610, Speaker A: So then there'll be like a balance of an untoken for the person who front run and then a positive token to the person who had their transaction from them. That's basically the idea. Interesting. Okay, cool. So is this purely just like a feel good system or is there a sort of monetary value attached to these? Well, more of a feel good system. It would be kind of ironic if the negative token got some monetary value and then the people who we were awarding them to got money out of it. It could do like it's open market, isn't it's a free market? So that can always happen.
02:09:02.610 - 02:09:56.800, Speaker A: But it's more kind of a basis to highlight addresses that have been front running a lot and then maybe exchanges could take note of that. They could see this account has got a lot of these negative tokens. Maybe we will not take transactions from them or something along those lines in the future, who knows? Yeah. Until we can solve front running, this might be a fun way just to kind of shame those who steal other people's hard work. Yeah, that's interesting. So what's your method for surfacing front running? Because there's not like a label on Ether scan that says, hey, I'm front running. How are you actually figuring that out? So, looking at the mined blocks, finding identical transactions, but just with slightly different gas fees.
02:09:56.800 - 02:10:56.032, Speaker A: So the higher gas fee obviously would get mined first and that will be the one that has front run, the one with lower gas. And then if the front run transaction, because there could be multiple front run transactions for one as well, so it could be several going or for the original transaction, maybe it's still stuck in the mempool somewhere. So it would be a case of trying to analyze the mempool a bit. Look out for that original transaction with the lower gas, with the timestamp as well. The first one is going to be the first one and then the later one is always going to have a later timestamp. So yeah, a couple of ways of potentially finding it, it would basically just be a best guess. You would have these rules that you set up and then you have a rough idea of like, yeah, this is probably front running, so we're going to award them a token or not, depending on this rough framework.
02:10:56.032 - 02:11:48.580, Speaker A: Yeah, basically. Okay, cool. Somebody in the chat also mentioned this, but I was thinking that I don't even know if you need a token, it could just be a leaderboard of tracking because otherwise then who's going to pay for the ETH gas costs to transfer all these tokens? Were you planning on doing that? Well, it'll be ideal to send them tokens. Yeah, it would cost money at the moment, maybe with E two, it would be a lot cheaper to send these tokens, who knows? Or if gas prices come down a bit or do batch updates as well. So perhaps like once a day we could send out one transaction and just send out all these tokens for everyone in one go. The problem with having a leaderboard is where is it going to be hosted and is it going to be accessible and that sort of thing. Whereas if you just give them tokens, they can't deny it, they can't kind of refute them, they could send them elsewhere perhaps.
02:11:48.580 - 02:12:38.244, Speaker A: Then it's kind of just open on the blockchain, decentralized as much as possible. We would have to have some like a Raspberry pi or something analyzing the blockchain to see what's going on and have some server somewhere running the back end, but generally have it as decentralized as possible. So it could be quite fun to have a leaderboard, as you say, like somewhere you could go, like an Ether scan type thing where you can click and see what transactions they've taken. Yeah, because I mean, at the end of the hackathon or whenever you're done with this project, what is the output going to be? Because you can have all these tokens issued, but you're going to want to track them somewhere, right? I don't know. You're not going to want to go to Etherscan for each address, see if they have it. You will need a way to track this eventually. So maybe the output would be this leaderboard whether you host it or not.
02:12:38.244 - 02:12:53.516, Speaker A: Or there's a more decentralized way to host it on IPFS ENS. Interesting idea. I like it. Cool. Thanks. Thanks for your input and thanks again. Yeah, for sure, no problem.
02:12:53.516 - 02:13:22.580, Speaker A: Barat asked if this chat is going to get lost. Typically, I mean, the Zoom chat gets saved, but we don't publish it. If there's something specific you'd like to go back through to see, I can definitely pull that out. But for now, we don't publish the Zoom Chat. Thanks for sharing, Tom. Cool. Thank you, Trent.
02:13:22.580 - 02:13:52.140, Speaker A: Romaine Figuero. Okay. Hey. Romaine is not here because he has to go back to work. So I'm going to present for Paladin project. Sure. So basically what we want to do is use all the new use for all the governance token that people just get for the value and don't use with the governance side.
02:13:52.140 - 02:15:21.848, Speaker A: They don't vote on Ave proposition and stuff. So we want to have a new money Lego like pools where people can provide their Ave tokens and other can just borrow the tokens to use the delegating power to vote or to propose some stuff on the Ave governance system. And what would be interesting with our system is that the tokens, the Ave token for example, will not leave the protocol. We'll use smart contracts and the delegate function from the AF token to give the power to the user that borrows. So the devouting power, but it does not get the AF token, it just gets delegation power. And we have a small contract that we create for the borrow and that just store the amount of a token he asks for and we send it back to the pool later. And we'll have a stablecore system to pay the borrowing fees and so to swap those stablecoin back to Ave token or token later to get interest to the liquidity providers having kind of similar system than Compound or Ave have with the token that represents for example, the Ave token you put in the pool.
02:15:21.848 - 02:16:38.888, Speaker A: So the liquidity you provided so that we call the V token for. So for the Akaton we want to having a proof of concept of this protocol and working with the Aves token and also the Stack Ave token. So bring a new interesting site to the Stake ave token because user can stake their AF token in the ave system to get the stake ave and then use the stake ave and put them in the paladin protocol and get another what we call double dip system and get more returns on their token through the palleting. If someone wants to borrow their stack ave and just the dedicating power and they get some rewards on it. Yes. So for the account we want to try and make it work with the Ave and Stake ave token and maybe later go on with adding new tokens. But that's the tricky part because every governance system has a different way to delegate power like they don't have for ERC token, like a basic understanding.
02:16:38.888 - 02:17:30.244, Speaker A: They just did their own version of the delegation system. So we'd have to do a new pool and a new contract for each token we want to add to the protocol. But basically it's to add the compound uni token and stuff so people can get some value out of those token, like a new way to get values out of those token. Okay, yeah. The first project that comes to mind is something called PowerPool. I put the link in the chat where it's a similar concept, but I think there are some differentiations where they are pooling governance tokens and I think there's a dow attached to it. I haven't dug very much into what their main goal is, but I think that's a good question for you.
02:17:30.244 - 02:19:41.630, Speaker A: Do you plan on this being will it just be a place where people can deposit and lend the governance tokens or do you plan for this to be an active venture where members of the pool actually can go and use them or they have a special benefit? So at first it will just be the basic lending and borrow system to get some interest back on the loans. And later we thought about having some kind of voting system for the tokens that are still in the pool when, for example, an ave proposition is put to vote if the snapshot is done and some tokens are still in the Ave v. Pool, like our pool in the playdin, protocol will have some way to vote for every liquidity provider so they can have consensus between them and put those token to vote also so we don't lose the voting power for the token that hasn't been borrowed in the system. And yeah, we saw about Power pool but we think it's not the same system. We don't want for example, the Tokens to leave Paladin so we have some kind of insurance for the liquidity provider to be sure that their token isn't going anywhere. And so we don't have to use huge collateral for loans. We just need to have a fee system where the borrower has to put some amount of die that's going to get him alone until a given block depending on the token price and just have to put some more fees in the protocol to extend the loan or close the loan to get back the fees that were not used at the time you closed and stuff and have some kind of liquidation system with some reward to close the loans that were not closed by the borrowers and stuff.
02:19:41.630 - 02:20:26.648, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I think it does sound like it's a different system than PowerPool, so I would like to learn more. Similar to what I've said to other projects. I know many people just showed up to verbally describe it, but if you have in the future a diagram or some visual aid, that will definitely help know when you're giving the introducing your demo next week or when you actually go to make your submission. Video visuals are really helpful for yeah, maybe we had some. Maybe Roma had some. But because he was supposed to present and was not me so kind of in the last what he was planning to show you and I might not have the links on. Cool.
02:20:26.648 - 02:20:55.652, Speaker A: Yeah. No, no, like I said, not an issue for this time, but I will probably be able to understand it a little bit better or have some different insights if there's a diagram. So maybe if he has anything, feel free to share it in the discord once you connect with him again. But thanks for sharing the project. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time. All right, so it looks like a lot of people have dropped off on that Google Doc, so I've moved names that I think are gone to the bottom.
02:20:55.652 - 02:21:09.736, Speaker A: If you're still here, just say it in the chat. But we are going to just keep going down the list. We've got a few left. The next up is Watchful Eye. John C. And Stephen. Are you still here? Yeah, this is John.
02:21:09.736 - 02:21:42.672, Speaker A: I was going to turn my camera, but for some reason things always break when they should. No worries. Let me screen shared. Okay. Can you all see that? Yeah, maybe. Can you do it full screen or a little bit larger? I'm going to zoom into each kind of considerable part as I talk about it a little bit more. Shoot.
02:21:42.672 - 02:22:10.330, Speaker A: So Watchful Eye actually, it started as we were looking at the one inch bounties that were out, and one of them, the second one was an automated liquidation bot. So we decided to go with that. And things change as you research into what you're going to do, but we kind of decided on basically what watch.
