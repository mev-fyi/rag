00:00:07.130 - 00:00:34.838, Speaker A: So good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for coming to the workshop on Nextid at with Mask Network. My name is Hannah. I'm one of the co founders of Nextid and head of global growth at Mask. And today we'll have David here leading our developer relations, talking more about how to take reputation every where with decentralized identity and universal profiles. And we'll definitely talk more about for this hackathon, some of the exciting things we want to build with all of y'all. So without further ado, David, take it away.
00:00:34.924 - 00:01:09.860, Speaker B: All right, so as much as I love fragmented tension, we're going to do a quick exercise that will make this really a lot more fun. And it's a review. That for me. Oh, good. Now that I have your attention, we are taking reputation anywhere and everywhere. We have cool pictures to tell you who we are, because just in case we're faking our identities, you need to know that at least we are cool. So there we are.
00:01:09.860 - 00:02:15.830, Speaker B: We're going to jump straight in and cover a quick context of what has identity been in the past, what is it today and where is it going in the future? And why does all the stuff that we do really, really matter in a deeply important way for that? Traditionally, identity looks like credentials that allow us to do things like get mortgages or go to bars. They come from a central issuer and they're super, super useful and powerful for us. But today, the world is transitioning bit by bit and slowly and all at once from analog to digital. And so we see that represented a few metrics. 8% more time year over year has been spent every year for the last 20 years online. So we start to think like, we have these really useful identities for the analog world that go with us when we go to a new place. But how does that look online? How do we have identities that we can control and identities that we can take with us to different parts of the internet.
00:02:15.830 - 00:03:07.606, Speaker B: So a lot of people ask, is a wallet an identity? The answer is actually no. It's an identifier. It's like an email address. It's something that represents a way that someone can find you. And so what we look at is, like, how do we combine identifiers traditionally in web3, identifiers in web two, such as Twitter handles and email or YouTube channels or whatever you want, and all of the data and reputation that you've built, how do we package that into identity that you can bring with you to any place in any ecosystem? And the whole point of all this is our identities today in the real world are sovereign, portable and relatively secure. But a wallet address doesn't really pass that test because it can't really go outside of a single chain ecosystem usually. So we're to look at like, how do we solve that? How do we move forward, it's going to be cool.
00:03:07.606 - 00:04:31.594, Speaker B: So we think of identity as a sum of the Identifiers of the person that represent who you are. So this would be like, it could be an Ethereum address linked to your Twitter, linked to your Facebook, to some sort of business page that you have. And one of the cool concepts about this is when you have a universal identity graph, when you go to a new place, if you as a devs are like, hey, I wonder if this user has an identity or has a footprint, are they a real person or real enough person? What information did they bring with them that is useful? Can I instantly personalize an experience in my DAP or in my app? Because now I know their Ethereum history, their solana history, the amount of Twitter, the type of their Twitter footprint and all of that. So it's kind of cool and we'll spend a little more time on that and hopefully have a couple of light bulb moments for you all. But we bind these Identifiers together with something called DIDs. Sometimes people say, oh, did decentralized Identifier, almost did is a decentralized or a decentralized identity. Almost it's a decentralized Identifier and it actually is something that we call an avatar.
00:04:31.594 - 00:05:22.706, Speaker B: But it's a key pair. And a key pair is used to sign proving ownership of your different Identifiers to create and knit this identity graph. So you see your avatar is your key pair and you're using signatures to record a record of I own this Ethereum address, I own this Twitter account. These get stored in a public database on our way where you can get them from us through our APIs. We focus primarily on data that is public. So a lot of times we talk a lot about privacy as a sector and there is a ton of information that should be below the privacy waterline of the iceberg, really important. However, there's also a lot of identity reputation that is above that waterline and that's most of what we focus on currently today.
00:05:22.706 - 00:06:17.510, Speaker B: So the public facing things of what matters about you. We have three primary parts of our services. So one is using is a service called proof service to create the bonds between these DIDs that constitute your reputation or your identity. And then we also have basically a way to query those or to get those get all the DIDs calls relation service. And then we have a really nice new SDK that makes working with these things super easy and it makes querying or updating what you call an identity graph or a universal profile really easy. So I'm going to jump into this really quick. So one way that this can look is pretty cool.
00:06:17.510 - 00:07:12.194, Speaker B: As you see here, we have for a single user all of the different profiles or Identifiers about a person displayed in one place. So if you as a dev want this information to make your profiles super, super rich in whatever you're building. This is how you do that. If you want to have the reputation or accolades that somebody builds in your ecosystem, in your game, or in your DeFi battlefield. If you anchor these actions to a did with our services, that means people can care or people can take this reputation that they've built in your product with them everywhere that they want to go online. So a little bit of a different paradigm and a little bit more portability than we might be used to ecosystem. To ecosystem.
00:07:12.194 - 00:07:56.630, Speaker B: But it's that same magic moment that we all felt the first time that we used a DeFi a DeFi DAP. When we logged in, we signed in with our wallet and then all of our information was just there. That's what we want to create beyond financial use cases using the same cryptographic primitives. And we are going to be at our booth and we'll be able to answer all these questions because it can be a little tricky. The SDKs make it a lot easier. It's actually pretty darn cool. So, Hannah, you want to jump in? Cool.
00:08:11.040 - 00:08:15.884, Speaker A: You covered this part APIs and now.
00:08:15.922 - 00:08:22.450, Speaker B: Hannah will talk to you a bit about bounties and past winning projects and a little about what we're looking for this week.
00:08:23.060 - 00:08:56.510, Speaker A: Yes. Thank you, David. And I'm going to start lowering this microphone because I'm very much buried short person. Great. So you've seen a lot of these demo of how web3 bio would look like and our SDK for developers to build on. And for the past year or so, we've been running Nextid to understand how to better serve our developers and help you build the next really exciting applications around social or gaming. I think this is.
00:09:01.780 - 00:09:02.544, Speaker B: YouTube said.
00:09:02.582 - 00:09:05.600, Speaker A: What it do you see it?
00:09:05.670 - 00:09:06.290, Speaker B: What?
00:09:11.460 - 00:09:34.980, Speaker A: My slides are gone for some reason. Do you see it? That's okay, I think we can yes.
00:09:40.550 - 00:09:41.970, Speaker B: Go on. The mate.
00:09:44.970 - 00:10:31.090, Speaker A: He saw it previously, right? Do you not see it? Bad. All good. You know what? We can go to East Global's website. Yeah. And if you want to yes. All right, so we have about three minutes and I'll quickly go through what people have built in East Global Paris in the past and what we're looking to build with you all for this hackathon. So, in East Global Paris, we've seen a lot of exciting projects utilizing both our Proof service and a Relation service, which is our universal profile, like SDK.
00:10:31.090 - 00:11:14.100, Speaker A: So what two projects have built, one's called Graph ID, another one is called Data for Builders. Essentially, they read into Nextid's relation service and are able to help builders build up their very credible user profiles. That has their GitHub lens profile forecaster on top of other credential or a newsfeed. So that really serves as the identity underlying, like a layer for people to get onboarded and start creating their profiles that's suitable for web3 use cases. And for proof service, we have actually one project called Builder Garden. They're a crowdsourcing project. Wow, I'm so big on the screen.
00:11:14.100 - 00:12:06.614, Speaker A: Builder Garden. So they're a crowdsourcing platform allowing people to fundraise, to attend expensive crypto events and hackathons around the world and to verify that you are a real hacker and you have these identities. You can see here, they integrated with the proof service, with our Proof service. So users, after they onboard and create an ID, they will send a message on Twitter verifying who they are on Twitter. And thank you so much David, for rescuing me with this tech glitch. Yes, and for data for builders, you can see the workflow here. So after users, usually you can create a connect to wallet flow and then read into nextid's relation service that will be able to pull through with one Identifier, multiple profiles, and then you can build more like recommendation feed, et cetera on top of it.
00:12:06.614 - 00:13:42.780, Speaker A: And now, so this time for New York, we're continuing the bounty around building cool applications and use cases around our universal profile SDK and our relation service. So if you want to build applications that allows for multi cross platform search and recommendations or developing the next generation analytics, user analytics, that helps projects identify where their potential users are most active, are they Twitter Djens? Are they like opinion leaders on a forecaster or lens? You can use our universal profiles to build that. And a new one that we're really excited about is a specific identity solution for so this is the visualization of how our identity graph would look like. And if you want to go back to the new bounty, a lot of us through the boost have already asked us about account abstraction and how they can integrate some of our identity graph or did into the account abstraction design. So we do identify a particular use case around onchain gaming, but not limited to onchain gaming. And then the potential developments you can do or to work with account abstraction and did through that lens. So the different challenges that we see in onchain gaming today, there's a lot of latency and also disconnection between different parts of the games in autonomous world.
00:13:42.780 - 00:14:23.130, Speaker A: So how to have a more unified, seamless onboarding system for the gamers and allow their reputations and credibility to be carried across different parts of the autonomous world, that is a big challenge and it's our first time testing out this bounty. So definitely welcome a lot of the feedback and see besides gaming, what are some of the other use cases you may be interested in building out this infrastructure? Yeah, so that will be it. We are right on time and if you have any questions, we're happy to address it offline here. And also we will be at the booth the whole day scanning through our QR code. There will have cool swags and also our dev will be on our office hours for the entirety of today and tomorrow. Thank you so much.
