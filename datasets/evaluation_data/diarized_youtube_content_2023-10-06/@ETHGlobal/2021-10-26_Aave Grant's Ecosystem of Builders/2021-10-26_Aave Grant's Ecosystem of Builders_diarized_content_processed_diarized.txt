00:00:05.290 - 00:00:42.140, Speaker A: Our next segment. So we are running five minutes ahead of schedule, but what we have up next is a ecosystem showcase of some amazing projects that have been funded and supported by the Ave grant style. So what we'll do is we'll kind of call up all these six speakers that are going to talk about who they are, what they do, and how you may be able to get involved. So without further ado, let's bring on our very first talk, and that is Hilmar from Gelato. And Hilmar is going to talk about everything that's happening with Gelato. So I'll ask you to turn your camera on and we can get started.
00:00:43.870 - 00:00:45.690, Speaker B: Hey, Kasek. How's it going?
00:00:45.840 - 00:00:46.202, Speaker C: Good.
00:00:46.256 - 00:00:46.860, Speaker A: Welcome.
00:00:51.980 - 00:00:53.870, Speaker B: Let's do you guys hear me all right?
00:00:58.920 - 00:01:05.012, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there might be an audio issue if you're not able to hear me, but I can hear you just fine.
00:01:05.066 - 00:01:05.670, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:13.470 - 00:01:18.922, Speaker A: It would be great to learn about Gelato and you can just take it from yeah, sure.
00:01:18.976 - 00:02:27.198, Speaker B: So, yeah, I work at a project called Gelato. Gelato is a protocol that automates smart contract executions on Ethereum and on other networks. And, yeah, basically we help developer teams to automate certain aspects of their DApps, kind of like taking away the burden of all the DevOps related technicalities that come with running sophisticated financial products on public blockchains. And, yeah, we received an style grant some time ago to help build out a cool product which is available on a website called Kono Finance. And that's basically automate, like paying back debt positions and preventing liquidations by kind of periodically always selling some of your collateral off for the debt that you borrowed and then paying back your debt periodically to avoid getting liquidated and having to pay liquidation penalties. And yeah, that's basically what we built with the Ava grant staff. And I appreciate the support of Ava.
00:02:27.198 - 00:02:28.100, Speaker B: There a lot.
00:02:31.750 - 00:03:02.794, Speaker A: Amazing yeah, I'll kind of do some Q A here as well. So let's kind of go deeper into what Gelato is. You've obviously been part of the global side as a hack member, it's been for the past few years and you've kind of learned so much about what's happening in this ecosystem. And I think I remember just chatting with you a while ago and you kind of also got into the Ave ecosystem a bit early. So just walk us through how Gelato is set up. What was the need for you to build this thing and sort of just everything's happened the past year and a.
00:03:02.992 - 00:04:23.174, Speaker B: Yeah, so things developed fairly quickly. I think like two to three years ago, I was still going to hackathons at ETH Global, hacking on some funny interest rate swap use cases using Ethland back then or now, Ava. And so, yeah, I was always kind of fascinated and tried to kind of build more sophisticated financial applications also, like options on DeFi. And every time applications require something to happen on a conditional basis at some point in the future, you kind of require this second layer of servers or keepers or bots basically running, that actually monitor all the states and then execute certain functions at future times, basically. And yeah, we kind of stumbled across this issue a lot of times during just hacking on stuff. And at some point, we were working on a project together with knosis and built in and became across this problem again. And we kind of decided, okay, that's for us developers, let's just build a tool that really just outsources that problem and try to kind of fix that for all of our future projects that we wanted to build.
00:04:23.174 - 00:04:31.030, Speaker B: And we kind of got stuck on solving this issue because it is not that straightforward, actually, as it may seem.
00:04:34.730 - 00:04:44.302, Speaker A: Could you dig a little bit deeper into that? What are some of the complications? How do you think about some of these guarantees and also maybe give us some examples of what you can do or cannot do with Gelato right now?
00:04:44.356 - 00:06:04.742, Speaker B: Yeah, so the very basic problem that you need to solve in such a system is basically making sure that transactions get mined in a certain period of time at certain future times, right? It maybe sound quite easy, but it's actually like if you think about the blockchain, you only have a certain block limit, right? You have a certain capacity and there are a lot of transactions that want to get in during the same times, maybe if they're like high congestion times. And you need to make sure to actually fulfill the duties of your protocol to get your transaction mined in a certain time frame. And this is fairly easy if you do like one transactions, but if you do like 1000 transactions in a very short period of time, you need to resubmit transactions, you need to cancel certain transactions, then this becomes very complicated. And doing this on one network on the Ethereum Mainet might still be okay, but if you then have your application deployed on Phantom, on Polygon, on Arbitrum, on optimism, you suddenly have to run nodes on all these networks. You have to deal with RPC issues. Running full nodes on most of these networks is nearly impossible for the average development team without a full time DevOps team around it. So, yeah, there are very infrastructure related problems that you have to solve, first of all.
00:06:04.742 - 00:06:58.774, Speaker B: And then there's the whole issue about, okay, then you are kind of like the only one running this bot, right? And if your company kind of like Censors or X maliciously or just kind of goes down for whatever reason, right, then your whole application, this decentralized application you build, is now not functioning as intended. Right? So similar to kind of like how the graph picked the kind of like reading data from the chain problem, we picked the writing data to the chain on the conditional basis problem, basically. And yeah, we want to provide developers with just this infrastructure piece that is decentralized, that is censorship resistant, that kind of runs also when Gelato, our core team, at some point in the future is not there anymore, right. That they kind of can rely on and it takes a bit of time. We are not there yet, but yeah, one step at a time.
00:06:58.972 - 00:07:20.110, Speaker A: This is great. And then I was going to say, I think in closing, I guess one obvious thing is that most of the people that are watching this thing and participating in Ethanline are developers. So as they think about their hackathon projects, can you give them some sort of thoughts or suggestions on how they might be able to use gelato? And what are some of the things that they can do problematic.
00:07:22.530 - 00:08:17.662, Speaker B: Every time your application needs to execute certain functions at future times. Be it, like, every ten minutes, or be it when Unisor prices rise above a certain threshold. Right. You would normally be required to kind of spin up your own server and kind of try to get these transactions mined for POC that might work, but in production that rarely does. So rather than just do that, I would just encourage you to go to App, Gelalo network. There you can literally just input the contract address of the contract you want to automate, then all the functions appear and then you can just select the function that you want to automate and you can write a resolver contract that defines upon which condition you actually want that contract to be executed. You can, for example, say, hey, every hour, or you can say when the balance of this user is greater than X.
00:08:17.662 - 00:08:35.254, Speaker B: Right? And then you just deposit some east to pay for the transactions, or like some matic on polygon, for example, and then that's it. And you don't need to worry about running any infra. It should work right away, and if it doesn't, let us know. Come to our developer chats on Discord and we can help you out.
00:08:35.452 - 00:09:08.786, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, hopefully everybody got excited about that because there's a lot of automation and scheduling you can do and there's so many interesting applications with that in DeFi. So thanks so much Omar. And for those who are interested, it looks like Bill's already posted a comment on how you can learn more and how you can find out the documentation for Gelato. So thanks again and we'll move on to our next demo and showcase. And for that I'd like to welcome Eric who's going to talk about Omni analytics. So Eric, whenever you're ready to get started.
00:09:08.968 - 00:09:38.762, Speaker C: Awesome. Hi everyone. Hopefully you can hear me. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and share my screen as I have a couple slides and so I'll talk about our project. So basically for the Ave grants, Dao, what we did is we were building what we call like an intuitive and extensible analytics framework for the Ave ecosystem. That was part of the work we did. And so I just wanted to start by kind of talking more generally about Omni Analytics Group.
00:09:38.762 - 00:10:42.800, Speaker C: I'm the chief data scientist at Omni Analytics Group, and basically we're a boutique data science firm, and we specialize in machine learning, data analysis, AI, and recently cryptocurrency. We've actually been active in the crypto ecosystem now, really for a number of years. But especially in this last year, we've built tools for the Ethereum Foundation, Numerai Uniswap, Gitcoin Pool together, and many more. And we have a little following on Twitter and 5000 plus people, they like to kind of hear about data science, crypto related topics. Basically, the goal underpinning what we do, it's always been about the power of data analytics and data decision, data driven decision making. So that includes things like insights from statistical modeling, EDA exploratory, data analysis, dashboarding app development. And our whole goal with what we did for the Ave grants, Dao, is we wanted to bring some of this to Ave and the broader community.
00:10:42.800 - 00:11:22.540, Speaker C: And so this was basically our focus, and it's still ongoing, but we basically broke it down into a three tiered kind of process. It began with a main net Dune dashboard. We later were sort of contracted into doing a polygon dashboard on Dune, and we followed a really similar structure. I'll show you both of them in just a moment, but then we wanted to take it a step further. So basically, we love Dune. We love the platform. For those of you who are familiar with it, it's just such a great way to collect data from the blockchain, display it, and look at trends and growth trends over time.
00:11:22.540 - 00:12:08.170, Speaker C: So we love Dune, but we were thinking, what can we do to take this analysis to the next level? And by our day jobs, what we usually work in is in R. And for those of you who are familiar with the R language, it's effectively a statistical programming language. It has all kinds of toolkits packages, libraries that can be used to do some pretty cool analyses. And we thought integrating with the Covalent API, where we can pull Aave data, produce a customized dashboard, and really take this to the next level as far as the flexibility would be what we can do to broaden the appeal of the work we've done. So let's take a look. I'm going to first show you the two Dune dashboards. Then I'm going to show you the R dashboard and just give you an idea of what we have here.
00:12:08.170 - 00:13:03.546, Speaker C: So let me take a look at this. So this actually let me go first to the mainnet dashboard, then I'll show polygon. So this is our first Dune dashboard, and we structured it in such a way that we wanted to present what was essentially the most important information up front. And really, this is like illustrating the growth of Aave as a platform up front and we sort of broke it down into these categories. So basically usage metrics where you can see like daily active users, new users of the platform, number of transactions on the platform, and then we basically have a whole section where you can see volume metrics. So this is things like deposit volume, flash loan volume, borrow volume, liquidation volume, and we sort of have this consistent structure where you can see there's always a counter. And that counter is like one day, seven day, 30 day, and then the total volume along with it.
00:13:03.546 - 00:13:47.130, Speaker C: We have time series. So basically you get an aggregate metric of each and then you get a time series metric where effectively that gives you a view of how the growth has taken place as a function of time. One of the challenges and things that we just had to overcome is ave. There's basically V one and V two versions of the contracts and we aggregated this. So you can see it dates back to June for the V one and then I think since December for the V two. And these queries, unless we're indicated, are all at the aggregate level. You can see this dashboard has quite a lot of statistics, but we tried to keep it consistent, clean, and the relevant stats really prominent.
00:13:47.130 - 00:14:36.234, Speaker C: That's our main net dashboard, the second one, and I won't take too much time on this because you'll notice it's quite similar and that was by design. We basically rebuilt the dashboard for polygon and so you'll notice most of the same metrics, some of them are still pending. Some data has recently been added to those tables that have enabled more and we're still working on some more, but a similar structure, basically all the metrics targeting polygon chain. So same idea there. And then finally I want to show you our start on the R dashboard. So basically what this is here is R shiney. So those of you who are familiar with it, basically shiny itself is a way of turning an R analysis into an interactive web application.
00:14:36.234 - 00:15:15.474, Speaker C: And we basically built a similar concept to the Dune dashboard, but what we've added so far is basically some interactivity for the user. So instead of just a big tall scrolling list of the volume metrics, you can select which one you're interested in viewing and then immediately get those results. You can also then filter to a specific date range. So for instance, maybe you're interested in since the beginning of the year to in this case September 16, to see the aggregate metrics across that time span. Then you can get that and we have plenty more functionality like usage metrics. And these all are dynamic plots. We try to include some ave branding.
00:15:15.474 - 00:15:52.930, Speaker C: It's very much a work in progress, but we have a lot of great ideas for what we can do to keep making this more extensible and more sustainable. One other quick comment just for those of you who are interested. This right here is our GitHub, and we're posting the code that basically is used to underpin the dashboard and the shiny dashboard itself on our GitHub. Omni analytics group. Ave growth dashboard. Anyone's welcome to check it out, follow the instructions to install it and run it locally. And if you have any great ideas for what we could visualize in the dashboard, we're more than happy to hear those ideas.
00:15:52.930 - 00:16:41.140, Speaker C: Okay, let me go back to the slides here and then I'll finish it up. Okay, so in conclusion, really what it comes down to, we're firm believers that when data underpins the decision making process, organizations run more efficiently. And so we really wanted to build upon the analytics done in the Dune dashboards. But with the R code, we're exposing the analysis to a wider swath of users. We're interfacing with the Covalent API and exposing that growth data in a way that really the whole community and other developers can access and explore themselves. And since this data is so rich, the potential is so vast, we believe there's a lot more that can be done beyond just what we've done. But we're really, really excited to keep working and about the potential of this.
00:16:41.140 - 00:16:46.900, Speaker C: That's all I had. Thank you so much. And if there's any questions, I'm happy to take them.
00:16:47.270 - 00:17:09.594, Speaker A: That was amazing, Eric. Thanks for covering this. I think there's a couple of questions, so I think what would be good to know is it'd be great to get your take on sort of the comparison between now focusing on doing this thing for DeFi and crypto and sort of what you were doing before. What was it like? What were some of the learnings or rather insights or the things you were talking about? I'll start with that and we can dig in a little bit more.
00:17:09.712 - 00:18:16.030, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a really good question. So effectively, when Omni Analytics Group was started, we really were focusing on general statistical consulting and we were looking at what are especially more underserved areas as far as industries that don't typically think about statistical insights as being something that they need to really worry about. And so what ended up happening is as statistics and data science got a little bit more prevalent and people started figuring out that this is an industry that needs to be taken seriously, they need to make data driven decisions. What happened is we sort of found the cryptocurrency community and things were starting to take off, but we were seeing some similar patterns, which is that there's a lot of data out there, but sometimes half the battle is just structuring it in a nice way so that you can start to find those insights. And that transition sort of was that this is another major community cryptocurrency and blockchain was exploding in 2017, but that we didn't have all the analytical tools that we do now and we wanted to really kind of push in that direction.
00:18:16.530 - 00:18:23.060, Speaker A: When you say you didn't have the tools, is that just a comment on not having access to the chain data or do you mean something specific?
00:18:24.470 - 00:18:50.940, Speaker C: Yeah, mostly that I think just at the time that data was available, but now we have it basically in a way like Doom lets us just trivially access it and that just opens up so much potential. The Covalent API is another good example where effectively we've gone from yeah, that data is all there, but now we have one unified API that we can just write some wrapper R code and pull all that and do some pretty cool analysis with it.
00:18:51.310 - 00:19:12.482, Speaker A: No, it's amazing. And then you kind of touched on this thing a little bit, but maybe it'd be awesome if you can dive a little bit more into what are some of these insights that you kind of hope to draw from kind of the Ave reports or the dashboards. A lot of this is I guess the way I understood it, a lot of this was just being able to present the same information slightly differently. But how do you think about being actionable from?
00:19:12.616 - 00:20:18.550, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. So I actually had a discussion about this yesterday with the team because what we were thinking like we spent a lot of time building up the data infrastructure for this effectively to show the growth of Ave as a platform and I think we were really successful in doing that. But to take it to the next step kind know what we're thinking here is there's all kinds of metrics that we're basically showing historical data on, that we're visualizing the historical data, but what we're not doing at this stage is actually making forecasts fitting statistical models. So for instance, we're seeing a sustained growth in the number of transactions on the platform. But what could those forecasts look like if we were to project them n months out into the future? And there's plenty of machine learning algorithms that we can do to have a pretty accurate time series forecast. And then it would be really interesting to do stuff like having these forecasts produced and then essentially compared against for accuracy as a function of time so we can continue seeing and refining the estimates over time. I think that would be one direction that would be really worth exploring.
00:20:19.290 - 00:20:30.380, Speaker A: No, for sure, that makes a lot of sense. Is this something that requires, I guess, more input from kind of the community or the governance sort of calls or how do you think about prioritizing which ones to focus on?
00:20:30.750 - 00:20:59.700, Speaker C: I think having some more input would be good because like you said, it's a question of prioritization. The sky is sort of the limit for what we can do, but maybe there's an immediate need. We want to say like these projections are just one example, but if someone was interested to say, what is the projected borrow volume over the next N months? And we started with something like that. We kind of could prototype it out, assess how the model is doing, and then expand it as the community sees fit.
00:21:00.710 - 00:21:12.806, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, exactly. It'll be case by case, I guess, or need based. And lastly, before we move on to our next top, how can people get involved in what you're doing and where can they find out more?
00:21:12.908 - 00:21:49.482, Speaker C: Sure, so lots of ways to do that, but if you want to get in contact with us directly, our Twitter profile is probably the best way to do it. Twitter.com. Omnianalytics. And if you DM us and just say you want to get involved with working on this, whatever aspect it is, we would love to collaborate. Like I said, everything that we've done for the R dashboard is on GitHub, and then everything for the Dune dashboards is obviously on Dune public facing. And we'd love anyone if they'd like to collaborate with us, just contact us on Twitter. My email also, Eric at omnianlytics.
00:21:49.482 - 00:21:54.120, Speaker C: IO if anyone wants to contact me directly, that works just fine as well.
00:21:54.570 - 00:21:55.030, Speaker D: Amazing.
00:21:55.100 - 00:22:03.126, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much, Eric, and hopefully more data scientists and your engineers come in and help out with those models.
00:22:03.318 - 00:22:04.570, Speaker C: Thank you very much.
00:22:04.720 - 00:22:15.270, Speaker A: And with that, we are ready to move on to our next demo and want to welcome Denison, who's going to talk about tally. Great to see you, Denison.
00:22:15.430 - 00:22:15.802, Speaker E: Hello.
00:22:15.856 - 00:22:16.170, Speaker B: Hello.
00:22:16.240 - 00:22:17.346, Speaker F: Howdy howdy.
00:22:17.478 - 00:22:18.702, Speaker E: Good to see you too.
00:22:18.756 - 00:22:40.626, Speaker F: Good to see everyone here. That was really great presentation. I was just writing out Eric's email address because it's like, oh, that's pretty cool. Yeah. So what I wanted to talk about today was the project that we worked on for Aave grants. Ours was a pretty interesting project. It's called Tally Safeguard, and it was originally built from a Uniswap grant.
00:22:40.626 - 00:24:25.574, Speaker F: So the idea of Tally Safeguard was to address some concerns around the flexibility and permissions layer of DAOs. And our grant with Ave was specifically around funding the audit with open zeppelin of these contracts. So I think the best way to sort of describe the Tally Safeguard, what the problem is, is that you have a couple of different camps when it comes to governance and the ability of governance to act quickly in event of an emergency. It's a little bit timely if some people are following the bug in compound introduced via a community proposal or introduced via proposal, there's this need to have a permissions layer around acting quickly. So what Tally Safeguard does is actually wraps the time lock, which is the sort of authority in your governance with a permission system where you can give different addresses permissions around creating proposals, executing proposals, and canceling proposals. The idea here is that you can go from a governance structure where you have the token holders who directly control a time lock to a situation where the token holders directly control the time lock, but they can add other folks as controllers on the time lock with different permissions. So, for example, they could say, hey, we want to add this multi SIG to have the authority to create proposals on this time lock that then sit in the time lock for some duration of time during which governance could come in and cancel them.
00:24:25.574 - 00:25:18.434, Speaker F: So the idea here is, if you have a trusted group of individuals that have the ability to create proposals at will, there should be some sort of administrative function where governance can come in and say, no, this proposal should not go through. Similarly, governance can give someone else the ability to cancel proposal. So what you end up having is this ability to compose authority in your governance. And the way that would look is a little bit how I just describe it. You may have one multi SIG that has the ability to create proposals, another multi SIG, or an individual that has the ability to cancel proposals. So you could use that, for example, in a setup where governance is open and it can create a proposal. But you could have sort of an overseeing group of security experts who have the ability to cancel a proposal.
00:25:18.434 - 00:26:53.638, Speaker F: Or you could do it the other way around, right? The security experts can propose a proposal, governance cancel it. You can also use it without a governance itself, where you could just simply have different combinations of multi sigs or different combinations of individual addresses that have different permissions to create, execute, or cancel. So you can kind of imagine how you could build any sort of permission structure based around that, so that you can have a dow that both has true token holder governance, but also has the ability to execute things in a quick manner, or can be used as sort of like a subgroup for treasuries. A great example that we first had thought about when we were building safeguard was grants committees, where grants committees themselves have this interesting situation where a proposal is created on governance that says, okay, let's give a million dollars to this grants committee. And now this grants committee is a group of multisig holders, but now they receive the money and they have ultimate authority over this money, right? It's not possible for the governance to claim this money back from the multisig unless you ask the multi SIG nicely. And this can sometimes be an issue, right? Like you can distribute funds to a multisig that are worth a million dollars on day one, DFI can go to the moon, and they can end up having $100 million in that multi SIG. So the sort of trust assumptions that the community may make around members or signers of this multisig may be different depending on the levels of maybe different based on how much value is being held there.
00:26:53.638 - 00:27:34.974, Speaker F: But this sort of like delegation of authority in terms of delegating money is really one way. So the idea here around Safeguard was that you could use it, for example, in Grants Committees, where you can delegate spending authority to a group, but the governance can still take it away without actually having to ask permission from the multisig holders to do that. So what I'll share here really briefly is just our repo so folks can see it and go check it out. This is what's being audited currently at Openzuplin. You can find it here@github.com with tally safeguard. If you go through the README.
00:27:34.974 - 00:28:13.966, Speaker F: I'm not going to go through the README fully, but if you go through the README, it talks about the sort of problems that I just laid out and the solution and vision that we have thought of, including sort of a preliminary specification on how it works. So this grant was for auditing it. The audit is almost complete. We've just gone through the process of addressing some just minor things that came up in the audit. Nothing major, but that audit should be completed in the next couple of weeks. Optimistically, next week. Probably safer to say in the next two or three weeks.
00:28:13.966 - 00:28:44.026, Speaker F: And that will be available here. Obviously, it's open source, anyone can use it and happy to really talk to folks who are interested in finding ways to incorporate this with their multisig, with their governance and multisig with their governance. Multisig end User externally owned account. I always call it like end because it's e externally owned account. So we're happy to speak with anyone about that. Happy to talk more about that. You can go to the repo here.
00:28:44.026 - 00:28:47.500, Speaker F: You can also always find us@withtally.com.
00:28:49.310 - 00:28:50.458, Speaker D: Which is here.
00:28:50.624 - 00:28:54.880, Speaker F: So happy to take any questions and.
00:28:55.250 - 00:28:57.760, Speaker D: Yeah, that was awesome.
00:28:58.290 - 00:29:10.706, Speaker A: Thanks for that. I think it's less of a question, more of like, I want to give you more of a spotlight after the audit is done. Specifically, what can people do and what would you like them to do?
00:29:10.888 - 00:30:11.958, Speaker F: So after the audit is done, what I would like to see people do is two things. One is I would like to see Grants Committees set up where the governance has true authority over the grant money. Right? It doesn't feel long term, right? When we talk about Ave Grants Committee, uniswap Grants Committee, compound Grants Committee these are very large dows with a lot of money, with a lot of prestige. And it's not so hard for them to find pretty high profile individuals who can be trusted folks to manage these pools of money. However, when we talk about the future and dows really spreading, not all dows are going to always have access to these sort of like, quote unquote, famous individuals with a lot to lose and reputation in the space to manage their pools of money. And they can certainly run into situation where maybe today XYZ Dog token, maybe it's worth. $1,000.
00:30:11.958 - 00:31:07.874, Speaker F: But something happens and boom, now it's worth $10 million. And, oh, by the way, it's managed by five anonymous users on a multi SIG that you've actually never met, right, of which you're not even sure they're all different people, right. It could all be one person. For these smaller communities, the risk becomes quite high and that becomes a kind of existential risk to the trust in the community. So if you use something like tally safeguard, these grant committees can sort of insulate themselves from that danger. On the flip side, it also potentially and I'm not a lawyer, I cannot give legal advice, but it can potentially help with the claim around decentralization, right? So currently a lot of governances use multisigs as their governance. But in the eyes of some legal things, again, I'm not a lawyer.
00:31:07.874 - 00:32:33.150, Speaker F: That might not actually fly, right? Like you have the concept of an unincorporated general partnership, which is what most multi sigs are. These multi sigs are if you create a grants committee with a bunch of friends, actually each of you is responsible for paying tax on the entire sum of money that is received in that multi SIG because it's unincorporated general partnership, again, this is not legal advice. So using something like tally safeguard, where actually the governance has the ultimate authority and for example, maybe the multisig holders can propose ideas that still go past governance and if governance does not take action, can be automatically effectuated, maybe in some cases supports the argument that you're truly decentralized, right? Because today using just a multisig straight really puts a lot of onus on the multisigs holders and a lot of liability potentially on the multi SIG holders. Again, not a lawyer, not legal advice. But the thoughts are like how do you build a safe protocol that's both safe for the members and safe for the participants who are maybe signers? So that's where I think that's a really great example for your governance, for your grants committee.
00:32:33.310 - 00:32:34.002, Speaker G: No, it's awesome.
00:32:34.056 - 00:33:00.950, Speaker A: And I think I want to also say that as a side effect of this set up, you also get to design a system that scales with the user base. Like now you can have a lot of people come in instead of having two to three or whatever, five people just kind of making a hierarchy around 2000 person dow. So you also want to think about those because that prevents growing even more amazing. So thank you so much Denison. And check out safeguard on the tally GitHub repo.
00:33:01.110 - 00:33:02.678, Speaker F: Excellent. Thank you folks.
00:33:02.854 - 00:33:03.402, Speaker D: All right.
00:33:03.456 - 00:33:18.180, Speaker A: With that, we are ready to move on to our next talk. And introducing next is Will Robinson from DeFi Lines. And Will's going to talk about what DeFi Lines is and how they work with Aave and everything that you can do to get involved with DeFi Lines. So without further ado, let's welcome Will.
00:33:21.910 - 00:33:49.782, Speaker E: Hi everybody. Excuse the background. I'm reporting from stairs as my house is under duress. My name is Will. I've been at DeFi Alliance for six months. Proud recipient of an Ave grant, DFI alliance has been around for over a year and a half, building out an accelerator that helps grow DFI users to 1 billion by 2025. It's an ambitious mission.
00:33:49.782 - 00:35:01.250, Speaker E: It basically means that we're looking to find new projects, grow them, invest in them, connect them, teach them through a curriculum that runs basically four times a year. At this point, we're finishing up with Cohort Five. We'll be doing a keynote next week hosted by Joey Krug, who is from Pantera and Auger. And there we will showcase 25 teams, two of which were sponsored by Ave Grants to build out protocols and grow on top of Ave. So, interestingly, early on we had partners from layer ones like Celo and Terra and Algorand. Now Solana and these ecosystems, they wanted us to bring DeFi to them and accelerate on top of them, but at a certain point realized that Ave is its own ecosystem, it's its own platform to grow and build on top of. And this is the promise of DeFi, right? Lego blocks.
00:35:01.250 - 00:35:40.350, Speaker E: And so Ave, wanting to support projects building on top of its foundational Lego block like, thus increasing its moat and importance in DeFi, tapped us. And we tapped them, I guess, to try and do that. And so only they and uniswap have been like layer 1.5 for us as partners. And I'll show you our website so you can get a sense of what we're all about. You should be able to see it here. So DFI Alliance co helping web3 startups succeed.
00:35:40.350 - 00:36:37.090, Speaker E: We have basically this theme around Terraforming new lands, and Ave's logo will be scrolling by in a moment there. So we have two Facets, we have the accelerators, which are DeFi and gaming. Now, my own background is across both. I used to be a financial auditor looking at crypto wallets and multi sigs and making sure that the assets were there and that I could sign off on the books. But before that, I did a PhD in video game design. And so I'm excited to do both and think very closely about the intersection between DeFi and gaming as well, because we see gaming as like, the road to future DeFi users. And I suspect we will be letting in Avagatchi, if not in this accelerator, in the next one, as like a very cool example of a game built on Aave.
00:36:37.090 - 00:37:33.058, Speaker E: And then we have this industry network. These are companies that are made up of market makers and liquidity providers to help bootstrap our DeFi protocols, but also, like, lawyers who are really important, and code auditors and community managers, the sort of penopley, of all things you would want to have to ensure success for your teams. And we've accelerated some pretty cool alumni. And yeah, what makes us unique is our access to liquidity and community and investment and we have these amazing mentors. The list goes on forever. You could come see at some point who you'd like to meet maybe one day. And the grant has allowed us to essentially bring these teams on without taking equity in their product.
00:37:33.058 - 00:38:12.080, Speaker E: This is allowing us to source better teams that just want to grow and don't need to worry about the financials or anything. And so we give them this sort of like VC privileged accelerator process and that's covered by Aave. So in some ways we're like a grant regifter in that sense. And we have a variety of resources. We also manage something called DeFi Grants where you can see not just Aave's grants but everybody's grants in the ecosystem. And we're trying to make this the go to place to find capital. So if you're interested in that, definitely take a look here.
00:38:12.080 - 00:39:02.350, Speaker E: We also, in addition to DFI Grants, maintain something called DFI Jobs which is over here. And we have like 206 jobs in DFI. This is all a work in progress. This is our old logo. But you can find like for instance, the nine jobs at Ave or jobs at some of our Cohort companies and other companies we've accelerated. The overall goal is to foster a really rich community full of signal filter, a lot of the noise that you find in crypto and make sure that we find strong builders who want to come work together from a diverse set of backgrounds and skills. And if you're interested in doing that, we'd really love to get your application in.
00:39:02.350 - 00:39:30.470, Speaker E: You can apply to DeFi or gaming. If you're building on top of Aave, we'd love to hear about you. You can get your questions answered here. You can apply through our form right here. So here's the Cohort Six application form which will be starting sometime. We said November 23. We'll actually be pushing it because we're also, as the DFI Alliance about to go dow.
00:39:30.470 - 00:40:40.910, Speaker E: We've been like a centralized organization trying to get this thing off the ground but we really want to sort of dog food the Web Three that we're building and think that it's totally worthwhile to experience being a Web Three company, accelerating Web Three companies in this way. So deciding to do that has meant this is a 40 day delay on this cohort. I also can show you our industry network. So because we've succeeded at attracting such great companies because they don't have to give up equity, we have great sort of service opportunities. So if you want and join DeFi Alliance, you'll jump the line at Quant Stamps public queue for audits for instance, or you'll get to talk to our Hype marketing team or directly to Jump Capital or Winter Mute to get your liquidity. And so all of this is possible because of our sponsors like Ave Grants. And the hope is just to grow DeFi as fast as possible and be along for the ride.
00:40:40.910 - 00:40:43.840, Speaker E: My sense of this is that.
00:40:45.650 - 00:40:46.038, Speaker D: We'Re.
00:40:46.074 - 00:41:33.294, Speaker E: Kind of summoning primordial forces when playing with crypto, these sort of like self perpetuating protocols that through value capture and then ability to redirect incentives, grow a whole new way of being and interacting. And I think it's terrifying and also amazing. And that's why I'm really keen to join this ride and to see where this goes. And so I think that's the passion that fuels DeFi Alliance is just let's make DeFi happen faster and think about it critically while we do it. I am totally happy to take questions if those do happen, but otherwise I can also keep going. Karthik, do you want to give me some guidance here?
00:41:33.412 - 00:41:59.158, Speaker A: Yeah. So we got a couple of minutes, I think. If you have anything else you want to talk about, please feel free to. I think the one question we'd have is you sort of talked about the experience of the accelerator without the dilution, which is a pretty good incentive and a pretty good pitch, but could you go a little bit more into detail of how the accelerator works? What does it mean to be in a batch? What are the things that you do for each of those companies and just a little bit more about that experience?
00:41:59.324 - 00:43:01.530, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. So it's something of a moving target as we're always refining and we're evolving with the times. Currently the accelerator lasts six weeks where we do about 6 hours of content per week. And that's like listening to Kane Warwick speak about how he built Synthetics, or listening to Wintermute about how to negotiate your liquidity deal or listening to Larry Sukernick on how to structure your Dow or Spencer Applebaum about how to give away governance tokens in order to bootstrap your liquidity that way. So these are really detailed lectures that aren't just like feel good motivational speeches, but technically difficult problems that you don't even know you have to solve from the industry experts, which is not like the Y Combinator who people compare us to, right? Where it's just like, here's how you beat those guys and raise your spirits. It's more like this is a complicated space. Here are some subject matter experts.
00:43:01.530 - 00:44:00.766, Speaker E: And then we have our ecosystem partners such as Ave and Uniswap and Solana and Celo and everybody sort of helping out in polygon and teaching our teams how to build on their systems. We think the future is multi chain, although we love like super deeply, we do want to see all these other platforms give it a shot and grow, maybe teach Ethereum a thing or two and vice versa. And so they're helping our teams navigate their own grants and their own code reviews and they're also giving their State of the Union and their vision of how they're different. So that's a pretty cool kind of value add. And then we have our regional chapters. So there's a European DeFi Alliance chapter where we get like, a chat from Ajit Tripathi from Aave and Melton demures from CoinShares, and that's always a hoot. And then we give a talk from China with our chapter there.
00:44:00.766 - 00:44:15.586, Speaker E: That's usually headed up by Mabel Zhang, who's? From Multicoin. And we have our Indian chapter where we'll have the Polygon people and other Quantum people and the other amazing companies coming out of India, give the lay.
00:44:15.608 - 00:44:16.914, Speaker C: Of the land, how to hire there.
00:44:16.952 - 00:45:09.970, Speaker E: How to market there, how to think about your community globally through the lens of these regional chapters. So that's like a big part of it, but it all sort of culminates with Demo Day. And a big part of our program is making sure you can pitch your company to a large audience of DeFi stakeholders who are going to know what you're talking about and need you to succinctly clarify what you're doing and who you are and why they should trust you. Something that people often forget is that DeFi protocols, until they're living on their own, are people, right, and they're going to pivot and they're going to change and they're going to make code mistakes. And you got to really know who the people are behind that protocol until it's past its Lindy Effect stage. So, yeah, that's our program. You get to chat with me and I get to help you out whenever you need it.
00:45:09.970 - 00:45:34.566, Speaker E: That's another part of it. And when it comes to the game track, well, we're trying to get the best game tokenomics people and the twitch people and the discord people to sort of structure your community. So if DFI Alliance DeFi program is about liquidity, the game program that we're launching is about community. Those are the sort of bloods that run through the veins of these different kinds of web Three projects.
00:45:34.758 - 00:45:58.130, Speaker A: That's an excellent pitch that if I ask anything more, I'll probably ruin the good note that it's ended on. So this is great. Everybody who wants to learn more about DeFi lines, head over to Defilines co. And I'm sure you can contact Will on Twitter as well as through the website. So I guess encourage everybody to apply. And with that, we are ready to move on to our next talk. Thanks so much, Will.
00:45:58.200 - 00:45:59.240, Speaker E: Bye bye, everybody.
00:46:00.010 - 00:46:21.180, Speaker A: So, next up, I want to introduce Matthew, who's going to talk about Llama. So Matthew is here. Whenever you're ready, feel free to get started. I think you are still muted, so we'll just give a quick second on being ready on the audio side.
00:46:28.590 - 00:46:37.120, Speaker D: It all right. Can you guys hear me now? Here we go. Yep. Cool. And can you see the screen okay?
00:46:37.650 - 00:46:40.160, Speaker A: Everything is good? My full screen? Yeah.
00:46:40.710 - 00:47:37.570, Speaker D: Awesome. All right, so hello, everyone. My name is Matthew from the Llama community. The Llama community received a grant some time ago from Arbe, and it's focusing around Arbay's Treasury Management, so some difficulties. So within this grant, we have a few main deliverables. The main ones are focusing around the vision for Arbe, what we would like to try and achieve with their treasury, how we want to put it to use and the direction we think we can take it in as a community. We're also putting together an asset management framework which kind of really structures a lot of the decisions, allocations, how we're going to implement it, how we kind of approach risk.
00:47:37.570 - 00:48:34.838, Speaker D: We're also going to put in some initial strategies. So put forward some ideas, they'll present it on the Governance Forum and then they'll progress to an arc over time and then hopefully we'll get one of those through within this grant or maybe potentially the next grant and then touching on some of the areas around like financial reporting. What we're looking to create is income statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets and we want to start producing those periodically on a monthly basis. And with that what we're going to try and try and do different from more traditional companies. We want to try and make this kind of live data and we're trying to use data analytics and June to help us do that as a tool. So summarizing the first main deliverable which is the Division document. This is available on the Ave Governance Forum if anyone wants to go have a read.
00:48:34.838 - 00:49:45.958, Speaker D: So this document is this outlines the vision. The vision we're presenting to the community is to encourage innovation, accelerate growth, prudent financial management of assets while providing relevant and transparent financial reporting content. We suggest that the community should remain overweight ave to capture the future growth upside whilst also hedging the risk against adverse market conditions. Assets are to be deployed productively within the guidance of best asset management practices. Real time financial metrics for performance tracking will be providing transparency to the community and support decisions around how best to deploy the community's capital and the treasury. Management and financial reporting is in its early days and requires nuanced thinking within crypto and this creates an opportunity for Aave to continue being a leader within the space. So within the vision we're also looking at how would you construct like a portfolio of assets that Aave would hold within its treasury.
00:49:45.958 - 00:50:51.620, Speaker D: So within that we're also looking at a lot of risks which are going to be heavily detailed in kind of like the asset management guidelines we'll go into a little bit later. We're looking to some of the unique features around like liquidity considerations at an asset portfolio level, but then also in DeFi specific like on chain liquidity. So getting in and out of positions, we're also looking at how do you remain long RV in your treasury and then also deploy it productively. And some of the ways of doing that is through debt and whilst maintaining that really large long ave positioning, we kind of want to hedge away some of the market volatility. So if we go into say, like a crypto winter, the treasury doesn't substantially fall with the market. So we're looking to try and offset some of that whilst also capturing that upside. So that's really about like maximizing the upside and then minimizing the downside and really just trying to deploy assets when the treasury is productively so we can make the most out of DeFi really.
00:50:51.620 - 00:51:42.980, Speaker D: So when we talk into asset management, we're kind of really here, we're trying to really create a framework that the community can kind of understand and refer back to in times like turbulence. Like we're really trying to drive this preserve capital whilst growing the protocol, whilst also trying to reduce risk. So that's just touching on that hedging angle from a price. But then idiosyncratic risk is also where are you deploying your assets. If you deploy all your assets in a single area and something happens to it, then you've got a lot of exposure. But if you spread it out across the space, then you've got less specific risk on each investment. So with this, the risk angle is very important.
00:51:42.980 - 00:52:26.250, Speaker D: There's the credit risk, the market risks, there's liquidity, there's infrastructure. So I've kind of touched on those few times now. And then the nuance of DeFi is the DeFi specific risks. And that's where you really start to think about like smart contract risk, admin keys, Oracles open source code. So basically making sure where you're recommending to suggest to the community that you've done the due diligence and this is a safe suggestion. So the way in which we tend to implement treasury management is through the AIP process. That means everything's going to go through the governance forum.
00:52:26.250 - 00:53:04.620, Speaker D: It's going to be open to community feedback and engagement. We really encourage people to review our posts and give constructive feedback. We're all just trying to do the best we can. So anyone who comes up with an amazing idea, we really want to hear about it. Within the asset management guidelines, we're also trying to think about long term for ave if there's any strategic assets that have a place in there. So that could be just equity through alignment of two communities kind of objectives. And that could be like just through partnerships as well.
00:53:04.620 - 00:54:09.050, Speaker D: If we introduce leverage into the treasury, we really need to have a strong understanding around that. Like really know where our health factor is, like our interest cover ratios, what are we going to do in certain conditions, like a lot of forward planning there. If you think of the treasury as like this asset allocation or asset portfolio periodically, you're probably looking to rebalance that. And within each allocation in that portfolio you've probably got bands of like Mins and Maxes where you want to keep a certain allocation. So that's something that we expect to be ongoing over time. There's the potential there to do a treasury committee and the suggestion we presented is that that would be something that would meet quarterly to review the asset management guidelines, the existing composition, and how it all kind of fits together with the overall objectives we're trying to achieve. And we look to manage the treasury in perpetuity.
00:54:09.050 - 00:54:53.854, Speaker D: So we're recognizing that the community has been around a fair while now and it's going to be around for many, many years to come. And we want to make sure that we're planning for that extended time horizon. So the best way for us to frame that is to consider this in perpetuity. This slide, trying to show some of the work we've already done. There's a June analytics page that's out was done by one of the Llama community members. So what this is showing right now is at the top left you've got like the ethereum reserve factor, which is essentially are they V two? V one, how much revenue has been generated from it. So, as you can see here, we're looking at like 15.5
00:54:53.854 - 00:55:33.580, Speaker D: million, which is really good. We got the ecosystem reserve, which is basically the core are they holding? And on the right we've got the Polygon reserve factor, which is how much revenue has been generated on the Polygon network. And you can see from the charts, particularly the one on the left, it looks a little bit exponential. Like, it's a really great chart and Polygon has done really well. It's like coming out of the blocks and it's been super strong performance for the Aave community. So there's a lot more charts on this Aave and Llama dashboard. So for everyone who's keen to have a look at some of those financial metrics, we encourage you to go have a look.
00:55:33.580 - 00:56:22.486, Speaker D: So, coming into some of the more financial kind of reporting side of the grant, what we've got here is this is one of the first statements we produced, which is basically a USD nominated RV Twelve, like PNL statement. So what it's doing is it's showing monthly the USD value that RBA. This revenue is generating USD value. Now, you know from the previous chart that when you accumulate it, it looks pretty exponential. What you can see here is if you look across the bottom line, as you can see, Ave is actually quite performing quite strongly month on month. It's getting this good growth. You can think back and there's been a fair bit of volatility in the price of assets.
00:56:22.486 - 00:57:27.882, Speaker D: What you can see in here is the bottom line at Aave is somewhat influenced, but potentially not as much as what you'd see at some other protocols. So what you're seeing is a really strong upwards trend in this and it's quite a good balance sheet. So this is one of the three main financial deliverables that we've got and these are all available through the Ave Governance forum as well. And if we were to look at the breakdown of some of this, what we're seeing is the reserve factor is very heavily concentrated in USDC and Dai and USDT, which makes a lot of sense because those are the biggest pools on Aave for lending and borrowing. And the polygon network is generating very similar, but just in a smaller magnitude. But the distribution is a lot more balanced than say, V one, V two combined. So that's really what all the numbers are kind of presenting.
00:57:27.882 - 00:58:12.346, Speaker D: And if we were to look forward to kind of what comes next, we're looking to build out the balance sheet. That's the one piece that we haven't really yet developed. We've got the income statement, we've got the cash flow statement, we really want the balance sheet. And then we're really going to start going into a lot more data on June. We're going to start looking at a lot more financial metrics like how's Ave performing peer to peer ratio or peer to peer comparisons. So return on investment. All those kinds of statistics is where we're looking to kind of develop out, and we're looking to provide all this in a really easy format that the community can kind of take a glance at and really just kind of that's.
00:58:12.346 - 00:58:20.260, Speaker D: That's how our llamas today, what we've done with Aave and a little bit about where we're planning on taking it into the future.
00:58:22.870 - 00:58:36.760, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Matthew, and this is great. Maybe just one question would be how can people get involved if they want to and sort of what are some ways to keep up with everything that's happening with?
00:58:37.530 - 00:59:14.754, Speaker D: Sure. So best way to keep up with what Llama is doing with Aave is via the Governance Forum. Like everything we do there is published. If someone wanted to get a little bit more actively involved in the treasury management side for Ave in particular, I'd definitely be on the Governance Forum trying to contribute and throw ideas around. That's really a good place to showcase what you've got to offer in terms of contributing to Llama itself. I think probably just reach out to us via Twitter. So we don't really have a website with a discord where you can come join yet.
00:59:14.754 - 00:59:19.970, Speaker D: That's something that will come in time. But yeah, just reach out to us over Twitter and we'd love to have a chat.
00:59:23.610 - 00:59:43.980, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much for that, Matthew. And we are with that, ready to move on to our next talk and demo. So I'd like to welcome Ben from Rabbit Hole and we'll just give Ben a quick second to get set up. And Ben, whenever you're ready, feel free to get.
00:59:46.190 - 01:00:31.062, Speaker G: Everyone, thanks for, thanks for having me today. My name is Ben and I am the operations lead at Rabbit Hole. For those that don't know, Rabbit Hole is a platform that simultaneously does two things. One for communities and protocols. Like Ave, we help protocols find the best users and participants for their network. And then on the other side for users, we help them learn about onboard into different projects and use different crypto applications and help them earn crypto for genghis. So we recently did a quest.
01:00:31.062 - 01:01:50.130, Speaker G: The core function of Rabbit Hole is a quest where a protocol provides some amount of rewards that incentivizes a specific action for users to complete. If Rabbit Hole, we verify using the graph that a user has completed a specific action that applies to the quest. We reward them with the tokens that are provided. So we recently did a quest through the Ave Grants program where we incentivized users to both lend and borrow funds. On Ave Polygon, we targeted 2000 users and actually had 2000 users complete this quest and redeem the rewards within 12 hours, I believe were the numbers, which was incredible. It really showed the excitement within our community and within our users for using and getting more acclimated. With Avec, if we take a step back, Rabbit Hole is really appealing to users who are trying to get more involved in crypto and in Web Three and to become better and more knowledgeable citizens of the Web Three world.
01:01:50.130 - 01:03:15.230, Speaker G: And so partnering with Rabbit Hole and doing quests on Rabbit Hole is a great way to gain exposure, to educate people and to bring in more eager participants and owners of the network. So we're extremely happy with the way this most recent quest with Ave went. We are working with a number of other leading program protocols and communities in the Web Three space. We've worked with Uniswap, we just did a quest this past week with Polygon. We've worked on stuff with the graph pool together, all different types of protocols and DeFi NFTs layer ones, really focused on how to get users more educated and more involved in the leading projects in crypto. And then for the leading projects in crypto like Ave, how do we find more users who actually want to use the product? We're not about speculation, we're about finding people who are into using projects, want to be good stewards for your community, want to be active users. And I think moving forward, we'd like to move further and further on as a grand vision.
01:03:15.230 - 01:04:02.042, Speaker G: We look at ourselves right now as pioneering learn to earn. So I'm sure most people are familiar with Axio, Infinity and Play to earn. You earn money for playing in a game. We look at Rabbit Hole right now as pioneering learn to earn, so you earn protocol's tokens for learning about them and most importantly, actually using them. But moving forward, I think what we'd like to get to is participate to earn. And what participate to earn means is moving more and more into rewarding contributions to network and so what that might look like moving forward. And we're working on these capabilities and we'd love to continue discussing them with Aave and through the Grants program.
01:04:02.042 - 01:05:06.946, Speaker G: But what participate to earn looks like more and more is like how do we actually reward. Value that's contributed to the network. And so what that might be is you get rewarded if you've lent a certain amount of money and driven a certain amount of yield over six months period of time. And what that's doing is it's incentivizing real sustained contributions, real value provided to the network. And Rabbit Hole can be the place where you incentivize and reward those things. Rabbit Hole has, as I mentioned, an extremely eager set of users who love to participate in Web Three, who are constantly learning and upskilling and can be a really good partner for Ave as Ave thinks about new things. That they'd like to incentivize and reward, whether that's launching on a new protocol like we recently did with Ave and polygon or whatever that might be.
01:05:06.946 - 01:05:50.500, Speaker G: Rabbit hole can be the place where protocols go to find new participants, incentivize them, make sure that they're the right participants. We offer the ability to filter based on different skills, we offer civil protection so you know that every user you get is actually a unique human and can be a strong partner in helping Aave strengthen their community moving forward. As I mentioned, we're really pleased with the excitement from our Rabbit Hole community about the Ave quest we did a few weeks ago and look forward to more and more hopefully successful ventures down the line.
01:05:55.270 - 01:05:56.018, Speaker D: Awesome.
01:05:56.184 - 01:06:03.990, Speaker A: Thank you so much for that awesome intro, Ben. And just so people know how to get in touch with you, what is the best way to learn more?
01:06:04.140 - 01:06:35.950, Speaker G: Yeah, if you'd like to reach out to me personally at Ben Schechter on Twitter. But for Rabbit Hole, you can go to Rabbit Hole GG and complete our quest, credential yourself through our skills. If you've done different actions on chain, we provide credentials for that which can then be used to unlock new opportunities, unlock new quests in the future, and to dive further into being a Web Three user and citizen.
01:06:36.610 - 01:06:39.246, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much. Penn awesome.
01:06:39.348 - 01:06:40.380, Speaker G: Thanks so much for having me.
