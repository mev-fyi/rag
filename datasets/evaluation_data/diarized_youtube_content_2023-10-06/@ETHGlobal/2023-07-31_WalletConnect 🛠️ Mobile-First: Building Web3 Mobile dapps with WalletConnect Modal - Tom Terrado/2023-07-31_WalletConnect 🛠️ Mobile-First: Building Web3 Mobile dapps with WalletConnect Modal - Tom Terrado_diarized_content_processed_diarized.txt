00:00:07.210 - 00:00:25.640, Speaker A: All right, thank you so much for everyone being here. So my name is Tom, and today going to pretty much be talking about mobile first. And this workshop and just general overview is around why we should be building on mobile and pretty much a quick example app of how to build a Web Three mobile DAP with Wallet Connect.
00:00:27.130 - 00:00:27.830, Speaker B: Cool.
00:00:27.980 - 00:00:42.940, Speaker A: So just as an introduction for myself, my name is Tom, I lead devrel relations at Walletconnect and spent several years as a mobile engineer prior to this, hence my interest in doing a lot more mobile development at Wallet Connect.
00:00:44.510 - 00:00:45.210, Speaker B: Cool.
00:00:45.360 - 00:01:28.070, Speaker A: So for those who aren't as familiar with Wallet Connect, the simple way to put it is we're a protocol that enables two parties to connect and the two parties we essentially have is DApps and Wallets in this space and we're encrypted trustless, open source and chain agnostic. So we started several years ago one single QR code and now we would say several hundred wallets power us and many DApps use us under the hood. So we really try and facilitate connections between the two parties. I E. Wallets and DApps. So that's maybe how you might be knowing us and I might want to just quickly touch on what we've been working on recently and how this kind of relates to our hypothesis and reasoning for mobile.
00:01:29.710 - 00:01:30.410, Speaker B: Cool.
00:01:30.560 - 00:02:07.090, Speaker A: So just as an introduction. So to further extend, maybe give you insight that Wallet Connect is more than just a QR code signing protocol. And also a common question we get is, is Wallet Connect a wallet? The answer is no, we're not a wallet. We're a wallet infrastructure, an adapt infrastructure, kind of like as a communication protocol infrastructure. And these are the things that we've been busy on recently. So Web Three Wallet is something that a lot of wallets, I guess, use under the hood. And most of the 300 400 wallets that are out in the space that we power, they're the ones that using that one.
00:02:07.090 - 00:02:59.490, Speaker A: So this has lots to do with chain switching and things like that that you might have seen recently. And then Web Three wallet modal is kind of the part that we want to talk about today, particularly around DApps. So every time you might have seen a Connect wallet button and a QR code, that's kind of the core product that we started with. So a lot's been happening in that space and I think more recently you guys have might have seen communication signed to happen within Web Three. So I did a talk on mobile wallets the other day and it's kind of interesting in that we started in 2017, 2018 particularly, with say, a wallet called Toshi Wallet, also known as Coinbase Wallet, and they were actually doing messaging four years ago. They actually kind of stopped that and now it seems like it's kind of opening the floodgates of that. So we're also in the works around Web three inbox.
00:02:59.490 - 00:03:10.940, Speaker A: So web3 inbox is around push, notifications, notifications and chat. So this is something that these are the product suites that we've been working across and particularly wanted to focus on web3 modal today.
00:03:12.350 - 00:03:13.002, Speaker B: Cool.
00:03:13.136 - 00:03:57.800, Speaker A: So web3 modal, I guess some alpha of what's coming up. It looks very different to what we have right now. This is the direction we're heading in. So you might be very familiar with connecting with MetaMask, connecting with Mo Coinbase and any of your other respective favorite wallets. So this is what Mo web3 modal focuses on and pretty much every wallet you have out there, whether it's a cloud based, smart contract based, web based, mobile based, they're all available through web3 modal these days. And we're going to be extending it further with other features, new UI. And today I want to particularly talk around how we're going to work on just do a demo on the light version of why, how quick it is to spin up mobile development these days.
00:03:59.450 - 00:04:00.102, Speaker B: Cool.
00:04:00.236 - 00:04:35.122, Speaker A: And just since we're all here for hackathon and to win prizes, I think that's all we're here for, of course, but to learn. So thank you for being here. So we have around 20 grand of cash prizes to give out this week, a weekend first one particularly around mobile, that's kind of what I'm speaking around. And we've got some documentation all across all of this. But we got six grand for web3 mobile. If you use React, Native, Flutter, Swift or Kotlin to spin up a DAP going to provide some prizes around that innovation. This is our first time doing this track and six grand around that.
00:04:35.122 - 00:05:06.730, Speaker A: So if you're interested to work on ZK Proofs, ZK snarks and then use Wallet Connect as a connection through that. There are many great ZK EVM kind of blockchain systems out there, so feel free to use that. And another topic that you guys might have seen is 6551. So this is around token bound accounts and it really relates to the wallet space. If we talk about wallets right now, everyone talks about AA account abstraction, which is great. It's another form of onboarding. And personally, another one that I'm interested in is 6551 token bound accounts.
00:05:06.730 - 00:05:54.058, Speaker A: So the TLDR of it is if you generate from Tom ETH and then you purchase say, a crypto punk or whatever, then that is kind of as generated as a token bound NFT wallet account that you can start to identify yourself as. Okay, this punk now gets if you think maybe more around Loot, I think that's a bit more plausible. It's kind of like a composable way to build your inventory and identity. So really excited about that authentication. So this is something like really interesting partners like Instagram and stuff have used to kind of verify, okay, I am zero x, one, two, three, connect, sign and authenticate. So it's a really simple API and really encourage you to do that. And the last one is for those who aren't developers actually here.
00:05:54.058 - 00:06:19.240, Speaker A: And we're doing a design track of our cloud app. Looks a bit bland, can do a lot more improvement. So feel free to drop a figma and trying to recreate. Like how would you do user design flows so that's mobile innovation, auth and cloud. And then we have a pool prize of anyone who wants to just work on web, three modal web based stuff. You'll be in a pool prize, $200 or so. So that's that.
00:06:19.240 - 00:07:05.662, Speaker A: I kind of wanted to go around a thesis around mobile and it actually might work to talk about the wallet DAP paradigm first. So Wallet Connect has an extreme pleasure to talk to every single wallet out there, to talk to every other DAP out there. So yeah, every day we get to talk to them, we have to understand what they're facing. And I don't know how much you guys have talked to wallets in this ECC week, but a lot of them have just been like, wallets are the problems, wallets are the problem towards the gateway and stuff like that. And they're like there are three camps actually around the future of mobile. There's strong pessimism of like, oh, wallets aren't doing enough and innovating fine, if you want to take that camp, we can stay there. There's the other one of there's going to be a super wallet.
00:07:05.662 - 00:07:45.550, Speaker A: It's kind of around this thing called the Fat Wallet thesis by a 16 z a while ago. And it's kind of like, hey, there's going to be a few wallets that are just going to do really well and then unlock innovation for us. And then the third camp is there might be really niche wallets out there that are really just specifying on chat NFT and all of these things. So there probably are many others hypothesis of how personally that I'm seeing how wallets are being talked about. But the thing is we also have to focus on the DAP paradigm is why we're here for the use cases. If people are, pardon my French, are going to shit on wallets not being good enough. There also has to be better use cases within the DAP paradigm, particularly on a mobile friendly environment.
00:07:45.550 - 00:08:29.102, Speaker A: So that's kind of what I've particularly seen a lot around EthCC more recently is sure, there are problems on wallet we're fixing with onboarding AA and all these cool other bolt on features. But we also have to start now focusing on the DAP paradigm. It's kind of a chicken and egg problem. So here at Walletconnect, we really started on mobile first. We figured out a way of how do you connect your browser to your wallet back three, four years ago. And now we just really want to extend it to like, how can we make this to even further? How can we make this connect wallet button as seamless as possible? How do we make actual better use cases out there? So that's currently our take. And as to why we're really focused on mobile alongside, like, MultiChain and a lot of these other things.
00:08:29.102 - 00:08:38.370, Speaker A: So that's currently our stance, that we really want to help innovate and provide better dev tooling for both sides of this spectrum right on this wallet and DAP paradigm.
00:08:39.510 - 00:08:40.162, Speaker B: Cool.
00:08:40.296 - 00:09:15.598, Speaker A: So just before I get into the demo and the development of things, so you might have seen this as web3 modal. And what we do is we're really experimenting a lot more. So this would be considered the full version. We're going to be releasing social login, emailing, and pretty much you can access all of your wallets and wagme as a library ethers. And we're making it as composable as possible. And for the sake of builders and hackathons, it's much easier to use our light version. It's kind of just think about the skinnier version that allows you to bring your own library, allows you to bring your own tooling and have it go there.
00:09:15.598 - 00:09:20.110, Speaker A: So that's just some distinction just to give you more clarity if you do read art documentation.
00:09:21.730 - 00:09:22.480, Speaker B: Cool.
00:09:23.250 - 00:10:13.066, Speaker A: All right, so this is kind of taken from a previous thing in that I think we really need to this kind of actually is the wallet and DAP paradigm. Actually onboarding is DAP wallets. Let's just think about the left hand side is more about wallets and the right hand side is DApps. Right? So we really need to start thinking about like, cool account abstraction, MPC, web author and all these cool things that are coming out there are great. We're getting there, we're getting to a better place, but that stuff needs to be fixed for sure. But then we have to start thinking about the DAP features. And that's where we're trying to bring more tooling into the DAP side of how do you financially read and write through Staking and all of these really cool ideas that you guys are going to hack on this weekend? How do we innovate more on NFTs or onboarding in that same paradigm? So maybe token bound accounts, namespaces, identity.
00:10:13.066 - 00:10:46.730, Speaker A: There's ZK identity with Sismo and then there's like, ENS Lens, DIDs, Disco, all these cool things. Transaction simulation, those are copy paste. But MultiChain, I think that's also something we've really missed. I failed to see many good MultiChain applications either on the wallet or DAP side. And I think it's because we're still figuring it out. And right now with the whole L two summer or whatever we want to call it, L 100s, however many L's layers we're going to go down, we really need to focus on this. So this is why we're really trying to encourage these DAP features.
00:10:47.710 - 00:10:48.460, Speaker B: Cool.
00:10:49.470 - 00:11:27.960, Speaker A: So, yeah, this is on the right hand side is a GitHub repo of an example we have that I built out. So this is the most relevant thing for the hackathon if you end up wanting to build a react native wallet connect modal. So just as an FYI, I'm not leaving out any native folks out there. There is Kotlin, actually there is Swift and then there is Flutter. So I'm not trying to leave anyone out there, but this is just for the most easiest spoilerplate thing and just as a general thing of development out there. Wallet connect across several SDKs. We do unity even.
00:11:27.960 - 00:11:50.062, Speaker A: And yeah, this is just for react native. React native seems to be very popular within the DApp framework and Wallet framework. So that's just also a heads up if you're willing to bootstrap in that network. So that's just the GitHub repo. Hopefully that worked. So this is our one liner. Of course, it's like pretty bland, pretty quick.
00:11:50.062 - 00:12:40.142, Speaker A: There are some polyfills that you need to do and this works for react native CLI but also for Expo. We're actually thinking a lot more and optimizing on Expo for any react native developers out there. As a mobile developer three years ago, Expo wasn't there, but now we're really in a place where I can just spin up an application for react native and mobile, get it done very quickly. So really bullish on Expo and how we've done that. So I might quickly show you a demo before I get through all of this code snippet. So I am not going to risk doing a live demo because the WiFi and even though I love Expo development, I think it's just going to take a bit of time to compile. Left hand side, some code that I'll go through in a bit.
00:12:40.142 - 00:12:59.240, Speaker A: So the right hand side is let's just kind of assume this is the simulator. So if I go back here, it's just some tutorial says that the state of it is not connected. And then we want to go through the connect button. So it's just a pressable function. Very simple. Can you guys yeah, you guys can see it. Let me zoom in on the code for a bit later.
00:12:59.240 - 00:13:38.990, Speaker A: So yeah, pretty much just clicking the connect button. This brings up a UI. You can bring along your favorite wallets that you use these days, probably MetaMask Trust or whatever else that you use. Pretty much click into it. Then I pick Trust wallet, enter your code, whatever has your address, zero, x six, something redirection and voila. So I think if we can get to a state where we're easily figuring out how to do wallet development in a very seamless manner, I think that's the goal. And there are probably more JS web developers than JS mobile developers or even native mobile developers.
00:13:38.990 - 00:14:31.630, Speaker A: And that's the short truth. But I think what I want to pause and think about is that if in three years we're still using MetaMask extension as the first onboarding for your grandma or your child or your friend, we've kind of messed up. So I think we want to get to a place where we're trying to push more and kind of ask for better ways to do handling of mobile and just ranting on and thinking about it. There's better ways that we could even handle keys and do Opclaves and Web authent through Face ID and native account abstraction, all these things. So there are really cool things in the mobile space that are happening and I really wish that we moved towards there because once again, in three, five years, if the majority of us are still onboarding through MetaMask like window ethereum, we kind of messed up. So that's my personal take. So yeah, that was the connection.
00:14:31.630 - 00:15:11.440, Speaker A: I believe it kind of restarted. Just take you through the whole flow again. Great. And then you're connected. So that's your zero x address and then I can press a disconnect button and then from then on so this is the boilerplate for those who are in these platforms. You can use something like Ethers or VM or Wagme and there are other native libraries for Swift and Kotlin that you can use to help you think about the use cases. So it kind of comes back to this how do we build better use cases out there so that we can work with this whole wallet and DAP paradigm of things?
00:15:12.130 - 00:15:12.590, Speaker B: Cool.
00:15:12.660 - 00:15:42.994, Speaker A: So that's that still keeping it quite short. So going back here. So this is just essentially the wrapper of the schema that I wanted to share. Essentially you'd be just importing a Wallet Connect modal just as a UI component, project ID, so that's through cloud. So that gives you better tracking and measurement and just understanding about your project. And then there's DAP side exporting of the function going through it, opening up the modal and just injecting some data. So what's the name? Your DAP description.
00:15:42.994 - 00:16:12.818, Speaker A: URL and redirect. So this is something I want to point out for mobile developers out there or anyone, if you don't redirect your app, people are going to get pissed off. So please do that. You need to actually really figure out just doing these schemas is really essential. A lot of even the top wallet out there does not do this very well. So please handle these kind of things. So like you saw when trust quickly redirected back, that's very important.
00:16:12.818 - 00:16:14.930, Speaker A: So something to take into consideration.
00:16:15.990 - 00:16:16.546, Speaker B: Cool.
00:16:16.648 - 00:16:54.366, Speaker A: This is further extending the code of it. And the most important line is const, open and use wallet connect modal Corp. So we just made it really simple and we give you the power to think more around the provider and stuff like that. So opening function, disconnect function is done through the provider is connected as a boolean address. So pretty bare bone stuff that was given you and really don't want to complicate mobile development for anyone. So the function of handling that's pretty self explanatory. And then we just use the hook to open.
00:16:54.366 - 00:17:31.834, Speaker A: So that's that I'm going to do one quick run through all of it just in the Vs code format so you kind of understand where everything is happening. So, yeah, so very typical. If you understand JS, it should be pretty self expansionary. If you haven't done react native Project ID, go get it yourself. Providing the metadata of what you do, that's fine. Here, I imported the use wallet connect modal just through the top hierarchy here. I can I don't know if the Internet is great, but these are the other parameters you have.
00:17:31.834 - 00:17:51.550, Speaker A: I think I've exposed more, most of them. So this is what we have. Great. And then all you have to do is wrap it really with this. And then you can handle the rest of your app. So if you want to navigate and do that, do this as the top hierarchy then some very simple styling. So, yeah, that's the code there.
00:17:51.550 - 00:18:00.580, Speaker A: I wanted to wrap things up and cool. Yeah. So once again, just finishing it up really to kind of think about.
