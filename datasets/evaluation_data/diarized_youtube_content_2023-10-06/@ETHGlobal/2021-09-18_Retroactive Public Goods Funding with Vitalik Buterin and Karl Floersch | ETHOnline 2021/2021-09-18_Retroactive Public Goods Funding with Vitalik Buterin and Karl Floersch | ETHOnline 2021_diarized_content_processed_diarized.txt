00:00:06.490 - 00:00:38.440, Speaker A: All right, so we are ready to kick off our keynote Fireside chat. And I'm super excited to welcome Carl from Optimism and Vitalik, Buterin to talk about retroactive public goods funding. So Carl and Metallic will be talking about what this is, why this is important, and everything about this with each other. So I'll kick this off by saying, Carl, maybe you can start us off by giving an overview on what this is and I'll let you two take it from here. So welcome.
00:00:39.690 - 00:01:08.366, Speaker B: Sure. Thank you. Can y'all see me? Or maybe I'm crazy anyway. Oh, lovely. So here we are. We are talking about retroactive public goods funding. So public goods funding is a big topic in the ethereum community because a lot of ethereum software, a lot of ethereum development, a lot of theorem, progress and culture, it is the creation of public goods.
00:01:08.366 - 00:02:02.180, Speaker B: All of it is shared openly, freely on the internet. Okay, so I confess I wrote down a bunch of questions for Vitalik. I'm going to talk and answer a bunch of things myself as well, of course, but I just got to hear what Vitalik has to say. But anyway, just before we even get going, though, a little background on me. I was doing ethereum stuff for a while, worked at the Ethereum Foundation, and then now I'm working at Optimism PBC, trying to scale ethereum with optimistic ethereum, optimistic roll up, all those good things. So anyway, that's me and I guess we probably know who Vitalik is. So I'll even ask the first question v what is a public good?
00:02:03.350 - 00:03:54.434, Speaker C: So a public good is something that benefits a large and unselective group of people. So it's a thing or a project or something that someone can do or create that has a benefit, where that benefit gets spread out across a very wide group of people, where there is no way to decide who's part of that group and who is not, right? For example, something like scientific research, it's a public good because like, once someone comes up with some results out of their research that gets published and that's out there and like everyone benefits from it, right? Like there isn't some way to make to that make it only accessible to some people and not other people. Whereas on the other hand, with say, the iced coffee that you're drinking, for example, that is actually a private good created by Starbucks. Because even though there's a benefit that's diffused across a large group of people, starbucks has the ability to decide on a very fine grade basis, you're one of the iced coffee recipients, but you over there who did not pay for it, is not right. So with private goods, even private goods produced on a large scale, you can do that, whereas with public goods you can't. And the reason why public goods are such an important and challenging category is because unlike with private goods, where Starbucks can earn the resources that they need to generate their iced coffee because they can just sell the kind of tickets to become part of the iced coffee having club. With a public good, you do not control whether or not any particular person is part of the group of people who gets the benefit.
00:03:54.434 - 00:04:07.580, Speaker C: So you don't have that as your business model. Right. And coming up with ways for people who create public goods to actually get any of the value that they capture is this very hard problem.
00:04:08.350 - 00:04:26.580, Speaker B: Wow, beautiful. So one question there is, you know, Starbucks obviously has a business model, but I'm kind of curious. Are public goods incentive like for does the invisible hand work for public goods too?
00:04:28.150 - 00:05:39.370, Speaker C: I think incentive compatibility is not something that an object has in the abstract. You always have to look at the object in the context of a mechanism. So like for example, if we did not have private property rights and anyone could just quickly run up, kind of knock down your door, run up to your desk, grab your iced coffee and run away with it, then iced coffee no longer be a private good. It would be a well, I guess common good is probably more accurate than public because the iced coffee would still be rivalous. But basically the only reason why iced coffee gets to be a private good is the fact that we have property rights and we have this whole kind of economic and legal system that's basically designed around kind of putting them in that bucket so that lovely chaps like Starbucks can have a business model. So the question basically is what kind of institution kind of using that term extremely broadly do we need to build in order to make more of our public goods incentive compatible?
00:05:40.110 - 00:05:49.850, Speaker B: Wow, cool. Well, we're going to get into that soon but what would the world look like if we didn't have public goods?
00:05:51.650 - 00:05:55.280, Speaker C: Chances are you'd probably be dead of some stupid disease by now.
00:05:58.690 - 00:06:22.600, Speaker B: Because of, I guess the scientific progress. Because that's exactly wow, okay, well, real quick, how has Ethereum funded public goods so far? How did we get as far as we've gone?
00:06:23.690 - 00:07:35.470, Speaker C: So most funding of public goods within the ethereum ecosystem and also within lots of ecosystems just happens because there is some single centralized body which has enough funding to just personally fund a whole bunch of public goods and whose goals are aligned enough with some particular ecosystem or community or thing succeeding that it's actually in their interest to do all of that funding. So in the Ethereum case, it's the Ethereum Foundation together with a bunch of other entities, right? Like for example, there's consensus there is increasingly the Uniswap Dao MakerDAO has funded some good things and then Moloch Dao has funded some good things. Though even there we've already started talking about DAOs and so we've already started kind of talking about things that are not quite centralized but the traditional model, right, is that you do basically have a small group of people that basically just makes all of the decisions and you hope that that small group of people is competent.
00:07:36.130 - 00:07:39.920, Speaker B: Yeah. What's wrong with these approaches? What could be better?
00:07:41.490 - 00:08:45.214, Speaker C: I think the problem with the small group of people is that any small group of people is going to be missing important things. And we even, I think, saw some examples of this back when Gitcoin grants were starting up for the first time, right? Gitcoin grants started supporting things like various ethereum cultural projects. It started supporting various resources online, providing information about ethereum. It started supporting podcasts. It just started supporting this big ecosystem of things that the Ethereum Foundation did not even really deeply look into or consider something that it should be supporting. Also the other thing is that if you do have a centralized body that's choosing all of the public goods and especially once you start talking about public goods that have to do with things like culture and intellectual output in media, then that puts a huge amount of power in the hands of that one very small group of people. Right.
00:08:45.214 - 00:08:51.510, Speaker C: And it would be nice to be able to distribute that power more widely.
00:08:52.410 - 00:09:02.860, Speaker B: Nice. Okay, the moment is finally here. So what is retroactive public goods funding? Now we know what public goods funding is.
00:09:03.390 - 00:10:45.258, Speaker C: Okay, so retroactive public goods funding is this idea that instead of having your public goods funding mechanism, dow, whatever it is, fund public goods ahead of time. So where the Dow would say, hey, this project looks good and it looks promising, so I'm going to throw $100,000 at it and hope it's going to do something good. Instead, you fund public goods after those public goods have already been shown to have an impact, right? So right now, we already know that Bankless has, for example, provided a lot of value to theorem ecosystem and it's been great. And so a retroactive Dow might just say, hey, I'm going to retroactively plunk a quarter million dollars over into the bankless peeps. Or speaking of plunk, you might want to give a quarter million dollars to some $0 cryptography peeps. So the core reasoning behind this is that basically there's this large category of goods, or public goods that I call entrepreneurial public goods. You've probably heard the slogan that the way to be a successful entrepreneur is not to build a faster horse, right? A lot of the most successful and important private goods in our society are things that were not even recognized as being important at the beginning until everyone was already using them and realized kind of after the fact how important they are.
00:10:45.258 - 00:12:14.600, Speaker C: So with public goods, it's very similar, right? And so if you just make a democratic decision of, hey guys, we're going to vote on what things will fund in the future, then you're going to get some very conformist and middle of the road opinions. And you're going to get a lot of projects that kind of roughly line up with people's existing social desirability biases, but you're not going to get radical cool experiments that are a bit out there and 80% of them, or even 90% turn out to be complete failures. And everyone's like, well, dull, that's a complete failure. But then the other 10% end up really succeeding in making enough of an impact and make the entire thing worth it. So retroactive public reds funding, the decentralized kind of voting based like thing makes the decisions about what to fund after the fact, after the project has already shown value based on the value that it has shown. And if you want to convert that into proactive funding, then that's something that can be done outside the mechanism, right? So for example, someone could even just invest into a team that's producing a public good. And the retroactive public goods finding gadget could just decide that the person who made that investment actually was a contributor to the public good and they should get a really big reward as well.
00:12:16.010 - 00:12:23.980, Speaker B: Cool. And you're kind of alluding to it, but you've talked about this concept of project tokens. What is that?
00:12:24.910 - 00:13:44.420, Speaker C: Right, okay, so project tokens are this idea that some team that's working on a public good and is eventually potentially getting retroactive public goods funding could create a token and they could issue that token based on who they think contributed to the public good, right? So they could pre mine a large share of the token and distribute it out to different team members. They could put a large share of the token on uniswap and then let people buy it on uniswap. And when they do that, then they end up collecting ETH or whatever the asset is that the token is priced against. And then they can actually sell that ETH or just use that ETH and they have something with which to pay short serve expenses for people who are not willing to accept payments in project tokens themselves. And then the purpose of these project tokens is that later on, after the fact, when the project turns out to have actually provided value, directoractive public Goods funding, oracle can just decide, I think this project has been useful. Therefore, I'm going to just buy up these project tokens, and when it buys up the project tokens, that rewards everyone who holds any quantity of these project tokens, Nice.
00:13:46.170 - 00:14:07.020, Speaker B: So also at what scale do you see retroactive public goods funding kind of eventually getting to? Is this something like, I mean, ethereum? What kind of scale do you see ethereum getting to? And then how big could this retroactive public goods funding mechanism go?
00:14:07.550 - 00:16:59.220, Speaker C: I think the answer is basically the same as it is with Gitcoin, which is the only limit is our ability to actually come up with the cash to pay for these public goods funding pools. And like with Gitcoin, I think the next big leap of growth, the way that we get from 50,000 to 50 million, is going to come from us moving beyond relying on individuals to donate these funds and instead move toward mechanisms or projects directly donating these funds. Right? So the fact that Gitcoin controls a significant portion of the Akita coin supply, right? Like Akita, you know, it's a dog coin, it's an institution, and it's a thing that's going to fund some awesome public goods. Or if there is an optimistic roll up project and that optimistic roll up project collects transaction fees, then those transaction fees could be put into a public goods funding pod. So the question is just that what kind of fee or what money earning capacity of institution can we convince to start throwing their fees into a pod? And I think right now it's fairly small, but I think over time it could potentially get quite big. And the reason why it could potentially get quite big, right, is because I think a lot of these, especially very network effect dependent things in the crypto space, they really strongly depend on legitimacy, right? They really strongly just depend on this kind of social consensus that we should be supporting this particular project because this project satisfies the community's values in some certain way or does some other thing to make the community feel like they should be focusing on that particular project and creating a big, massive, positive externality that makes the entire community really love you is an excellent way of getting legitimacy. So this is one of those places where I think we have the opportunity to actually get a lot of leverage here, right? Basically, in order to create a 100 million dollar retroactive public goods funding pod, there doesn't actually need to be an individual or even a company that experiences $100 million of suffering, right? The act of contributing to the plot can even help kind of cements that project's position in the community.
00:16:59.220 - 00:17:05.910, Speaker C: I guess those are reasons why I'm optimistic.
00:17:06.330 - 00:17:20.010, Speaker B: Nice. I'm optimistic too. You talked about this concept of legitimacy. What is your theory of legitimacy? Because it's one of my favorite blog posts of yours.
00:17:20.830 - 00:18:02.022, Speaker C: Yeah. So the way that I think about legitimacy is I think about it as this pattern of higher order acceptance. So I accept a particular outcome and I even play my part in enacting an outcome because I expect that everyone else is going to do the same thing because on average, they think in the same way. So one simple example of this is how driving on one side of the road, or even walking on one side of the road is something that is kind of legitimized in that way, right. And it can be different in different places. These are kind of self sustaining equilibrium. They could go either way.
00:18:02.022 - 00:19:04.422, Speaker C: It could be on the left side, it could be on the right side. And in different places, it is different ways. But within each particular region, there is kind of one way to do it. And there's significant coordination benefits from the fact that there is one way to do it and it's self enforcing. Right? You don't even really need police that much because it's in everyone's interest not to crash into other people. So the kind of left versus right side of the road example feels really trivial because, well, why does it matter which side of the road you're on? But I think it's the exact same kind of effect that ends up deciding a lot of things that actually matter much more, right? And even things where the choices are different enough that there's even moral values inherent in the differences. And those moral values are often some of the things that we coordinate around to actually kind of decide which option becomes legitimate.
00:19:04.422 - 00:20:06.298, Speaker C: So one example that I mentioned is NFTs, right? Let's say it's the year 2035 and Carl Flourish becomes super famous and everybody really loves Carl Flourish. And Carl Flourish decides that in order to raise money for I don't know, what do I want to raise money for? Permanently ending all animal suffering. Do you like that? Okay, in order to raise money for permanently ending animal suffering, car Flourish is going to release the Car Flourish NFT. But then also at the same time there is Craig Wright. And Craig Wright also releases a Carl Flourish. NFT And Craig Wright's Car Flourish NFT is there the money there is there to benefit another really important cause, which is, like, which one of these two is legitimate, right? Like, they're both an NFT. They're both a JPEG.
00:20:06.298 - 00:21:02.320, Speaker C: They might even be both the same JPEG. They might even be released at the same so, like, why would anyone wants to buy one over the other, right? And the answer basically is that, first of all, if you buy Carl Flurch's Carl Flurch NFT, then because there is this equilibrium where everyone recognizes that Carl's NFT of himself is legitimate and Craig's NFT of Carl is not legitimate. That if you buy it, you have a better chance of being able to resell it. Right? That's one. And then number two is that NFTs are entirely built on bragging rights. He wants to actually feel like you have this thing and you can show off this thing. And if you go to an Ethereum party and you're like, Yo, dog, I got Satoshi's NFT of Craig Wright, everyone will be like, WTF, mate? So the yeah.
00:21:02.320 - 00:21:41.710, Speaker C: So basically, like, there these really important things, right? End up kind of like so completely hinging on kind of social acceptance, right? And these patterns of one thing being more legitimate than others, they exist everywhere, right? There's even two actively maintained descendants of the Ethereum genesis block. And one has kind of much more legitimacy of being the real Ethereum than the other, though, of course some people in some communities disagree, which is fascinating and important because it also shows how legitimacy can be kind of socially context dependent.
00:21:43.010 - 00:21:56.420, Speaker B: So cool. Okay, we got a good question from the audience. So do you necessarily mean public goods as in charity activities or just mean broadly as a benefit to a large group of people?
00:21:58.550 - 00:23:11.910, Speaker C: So charity activities I would define as being creating benefits to other people for altruistic reasons. You're not being incentivized to do it, you're just doing it out of the kindness of your heart. You get some feeling of passion from being able to do something meaningful in the world and that is actually that doesn't only motivate public goods, right? So like for example, holding the door for someone that's a totally private good. It's a service that benefits exactly one person, but at the same time that's an act of kindness. Like you could even say an act of charity that people do every day. But at the same time there are also public goods that get produced incidentally. So for know there's Facebook, they do a whole bunch of centralized stuff but sometimes they decide that it's important enough to create tooling for centralized stuff, that they create their own tooling and then they open source their tooling.
00:23:11.910 - 00:24:05.290, Speaker C: And so I think react JS got created that way, right? Basically they do create public goods as a kind of byproduct of their generally private good oriented activity. So that's something that it happens to. And then another thing that happens to is people just create public goods because they're paid to do them, right? If you are a worker working on building a road because the government pays you to do it, right? Like you're not necessarily being charitable, it's the job you're being paid. You could be passionate about roads and have a kind of ethic of the public service that you're doing or you might not be and you might be just there to get the money, but you're also creating a public good. So I guess you do need to make the distinction between what the motivations are of the people that are doing the thing versus kind of the privateness versus publicness of the thing that is being created.
00:24:05.710 - 00:24:43.430, Speaker B: Yeah. And by the way, one thing that Vitalik talked about a little bit earlier was that we are trying to kind of give a business model to the public goods. So what that is actually doing is it is reducing the amount of charity driven public goods and increasing well maybe not reducing it, but at least it's increasing the amount of non charity driven public goods. And so this is clearly benefiting all of us. But it's not about charity, it's really about paying people for the value that they're creating and creating that really virtuous cycle.
00:24:44.010 - 00:26:29.814, Speaker C: I think sometimes it's a mix, right? So like for example, there's a lot of people who are perfectly happy to take extreme pay cuts to work on things that are in the public interest, but they're not quite willing to take 100% pay cuts, right? Like they need just enough funding that they can feel like it's a comfortable job, right? And so there are totally people who, if there is no public goods funding at all, they'll just say, well, they might work on an open source thing for a couple of months and they'll say, well, screw this. The guys that are shilling scam coins are earning $25 million off of an ICO, so I'm going to go shill a scam coin. But if you just crank up the public goods funding a little bit, then you can crank it up to the level where these kind of not infinitely altruistic, but still altruistic people actually end up being empowered and have the opportunity to work on the public goods that they've always been more passionate about doing. So that's something that also exists, I think. Definitely in an ideal world, in a maximally fair world, something that produces 1000 units of value spread across a million people should be renumerated exactly the same as something that creates 1000 units of value concentrated in one person. But in order to create that world, we just have to have this extremely huge level of public goods funding that would just require really unprecedented human coordination. But while we have more limited resources, we are kind of creating second best to some extent.
00:26:29.814 - 00:26:43.280, Speaker C: But often the first dollar is the dollar that counts the most, right? And we are potentially doing a huge amount of good by starting by alleviating the worst parts of the problem.
00:26:44.130 - 00:27:08.150, Speaker B: Thankfully, we have a system for creating and aligning incentives anyway, our next thing. So this retroactive public goods funding stuff, right? It still requires governance. So governance is a big topic. So what would you say is like, what's the high level state of the art with respect to blockchain governance?
00:27:12.330 - 00:28:02.520, Speaker C: I would say the state of the art is still not very artful. So I think there's two main kinds of blockchain governance right there's on chain governance and off chain governance. So off chain governance is what Bitcoin and Ethereum use to agree on protocol changes. Basically, you have some kind of rough consensus between core developers, community stakeholders and some other groups. And if there's a disagreement that's irreconcilable, then it's not a vote. What happens is the system just splits in half and there's a fork and everyone kind of chooses their own universe. But then on chain governance is used for layer ones in cases like for example, Tezos and EOS and some of the other chains, I think polkadot as well.
00:28:02.520 - 00:29:25.406, Speaker C: I have no idea what DEFINITY or solana or cardano or any of those do for their governance, but there are these layer ones that do on chain governance where you literally have coin voting used, or sometimes a combination of coin voting and other kinds of mechanisms. Like sometimes there's indirect representative Coin voting and there is some kind of committee of delegates or whatever and they end up basically just voting to decide on what the protocol changes are. And those protocol changes happen often, they just happen with some delay, but it's automatic. And then there are application layer projects. So things like MakerDAO, for example, that have to have on chain governance because there just is no way to fully off chain govern an application layer thing if that application layer thing has what I call external capital, right? So what I mean by external capital is assets that are controlled by that application that are worth real money. Sorry, assets that are owned by that application are worth real money, but that are not defined by that application. Right? So like for example, if someone creates a version of auger of the prediction market where everything happens in auger in rep tokens, right? So you use rep to vote on the oracle.
00:29:25.406 - 00:30:26.820, Speaker C: The prediction markets are denominated in rep. Everything is done in rep. Then that's something that's completely forkable because there really is no internal capital. Right? The auger defines the meaning of rep. And so when you fork augur, you would fork rep as well, right? And so basically forking doesn't mean that you're kind of leaving any assets behind. Whereas if you look at something like MakerDAO where inside of their CDPs they actually have ETH and I think some amount of USDC and some other assets, those are external capital because those are assets that are not defined by the MakerDAO protocol. And so if MakerDAO forks as a result of some off chain governance decision, that off chain governance decision has no ability to make the ETH and all the other assets contained inside of the CDPs go anywhere, right? So that's why things like Maker do need on chain governance to the extent that they need governance at all.
00:30:26.820 - 00:30:45.098, Speaker C: Now, in terms of what the kind of state of the art of onchain governance is, well, it's usually Coin voting, sometimes it's Coin voting with a couple of extra steps. But I've written a bunch of posts over the years about why I find Coin voting unimpressive. So I'm also very interested in the.
00:30:45.104 - 00:30:53.550, Speaker B: Search for alternatives, what's the TLDR of why Coin voting is alone unimpressive?
00:30:55.410 - 00:32:19.340, Speaker C: So coin voting relies on this kind of concept idea that it's trying to create this kind of alignment between power and responsibility, basically because every coin is a bundle of the economic interest, like the coin itself and what's going to happen to that coin's price and your ability to use that coin in the protocol and governance rights. So you're aligning power and responsibility because you're kind of packaging together economic interest and governing rights inside of the same Coin. But the problem is that the financial markets and just the complex systems in general are really good at kind of disentangling things that are entangled, right? And there is a whole bunch of ways in which governance rights and economic interests can just become completely separated from each other. And this can happen because of kind of fairly explicit Bribing attacks, but it can also happen because of very mundane seeming kind of financial market evolution. So there's a whole bunch of ways in which it can happen. And once that happens, then the entire link is broken, right, and it just becomes possible to buy governance decisions outright. And once that happens, then concentrated interests just end up totally running over anything that's not a concentrated interest.
00:32:19.340 - 00:32:30.010, Speaker C: If you kind of push the logic a couple of steps forward, it just easily falls into very not nice equilibrium.
00:32:31.470 - 00:32:43.460, Speaker B: Nice yeah. What is the best way to kind of keep the governing rights entangled? Or what would you do to improve that situation?
00:32:45.110 - 00:33:59.660, Speaker C: I think in the long term you're going to need explicit anti collusion technology of some right. Like so things like Basi that we've been working on basically ways to actually make it impossible for people to credibly sell their voting rights, essentially. And this sounds difficult, but with some extra assumptions, it's actually cryptographically doable, which is really nice. Another thing that needs to be done at the same time is moving governance power into the hands of something other than coin holders, basically. Because with coin holders, even if you prevent vote selling at the level of selling by the current coin holder, you can still have the exact same effect using all these financial tricks where you just separate the coin from the economic interest in the coin, right. And if you move governance away so that the resource that's doing the governing is something non fungible, like some notion of unique identities, for example, then you end up alleviating that problem.
00:34:00.990 - 00:34:13.280, Speaker B: Nice so we have another question from the audience. What would be the best governance model futuristic favorite? The ultimate? What is the ultimate governance model?
00:34:14.930 - 00:34:16.874, Speaker C: Friendly AI dictatorship.
00:34:17.002 - 00:34:17.680, Speaker B: Yes.
00:34:21.410 - 00:34:39.400, Speaker C: No, I think ultimately, I think there is no perfect model. The answer can only come through experimentation. And like experimentation is ultimately what the crypto space is all about.
00:34:40.810 - 00:34:47.670, Speaker B: Can we learn good things from history about exactly some governance experiments?
00:34:50.750 - 00:36:17.480, Speaker C: We could definitely learn from the decade of crypto history that we've had so far. In one of my earlier blog posts, I had the criticisms of EOS governance, right, where you actually showed how it actually did very quickly settle into this plutocratic equilibrium where you had these really large holders that were just bribing each other to make decisions and that were voting for each other to be EOS delegates. And that led to the governance collapsing pretty quickly. Another example was that whole steam hive situation where Justin Sun ended up basically talking to exchanges and using coins from exchanges in order to cement his control over an ecosystem, at least until that got resolved by hive forking away into being their own thing. So there. Have definitely been historical examples of Coin governance going wrong in various ways, even in the absence of attackers. I think we've seen things like low participation rates, generally low quality of decision making output in a lot of cases just because you're spreading out the decision making power so thinly that you get a kind of tragedy of the commons and figuring out what the right decision is.
00:36:17.480 - 00:36:25.720, Speaker C: So these things have all happened in various corners of Dow land and it's definitely important to keep them all in mind.
00:36:26.970 - 00:36:56.370, Speaker B: Nice. In 2015 I made this decision that I wanted to basically spend the rest of my life working for Dows. And I think I've mostly succeeded in this, depending on your interpretations. But I'm just kind of curious, what do you expect the role of Dows to play in our everyday lives? Maybe not everyone's everyday life, but it seems more and more people are being directly impacted by DAOs.
00:36:57.830 - 00:37:53.300, Speaker C: So anyone who's ever used dai has used a stablecoin that's managed by a mean. Anyone who's ever used rye, like you could probably call the Governance gadget for that or the Oracle gadget for that a Dao as well. There's definitely an increasing number of people working for DAOs directly or indirectly. So Gitcoin is slowly dow fying. For example. And so everyone who works for or gets paid out of quadratic funding pools, a lot of them are going to end up ultimately being paid by Dows of some kind. Once you start thinking of protocols as being Dows, then lots of people are going to end up being just paid by things, by revenue that ultimately comes from application fees of some kind.
00:37:53.300 - 00:38:39.460, Speaker C: DAOs are going to provide an increasing number of services. So Claros, you could call that a Dao and Queros as kind of the ultimate dispute resolution mechanism for proof of humanity. And so anyone who's going to be getting a crypto UBI in the future is going to have multiple Dows, an entire supply chain of these Dows talking to each other and serving as economic backup for each other to thank for their ability to get that UBI. I think most things in the crypto verse are going to have some portion of their stuff made in Dow land.
00:38:40.550 - 00:38:53.640, Speaker B: Oh man, it's going to be exciting. But what is the big failure mode? Or are there any things that you're afraid of with this increasing Dowification of everything?
00:38:55.050 - 00:39:37.854, Speaker C: I'm definitely afraid of bad governance mechanisms becoming entrenched. So Coin voting is a big example, right, of a mechanism that I think right now has more legitimacy than it deserves to, I think because Coin voting just is more it is credibly neutral, right? So there's that and there hasn't really been any efforts to try to come up with any legitimate alternative. And one of the other problems with Coin voting also is that I think the main reason why a lot of the existing Coin voting based projects have not been attacked or broken yet is because their Coin holdings are actually pretty centralized.
00:39:37.902 - 00:39:38.222, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:38.296 - 00:40:31.094, Speaker C: And one of the ironies of bad governance mechanisms is that bad governance mechanisms tend to get more secure the more centralized they are. Because if you go down to having a very small number of participants, then the fact that the participants all know each other and they're all buddy budy with each other and they're not really going to do look one. Of them is really not going to do anything that will compromise their ability to have their beer or their iced coffee or whatever with the other participants. So the more you get into kind of tiny, super wealthy, old voice clique world, the more resistant it is to attacks for that reason. But that's not a healthy equilibrium, right. Because we're just going right back to a small quak and often you get a quak that's less competent than the quake that you would get if you just explicitly installed a technocracy. Right.
00:40:31.094 - 00:40:54.800, Speaker C: Because these people are not a technocracy, they're a moneyocracy. And they've been selected into their position by their ability to get money. There are definitely our failure modes that arise from that sort of thing. So how to avoid both of those? Well, I mean, that's part of what this whole conversation is trying to be about.
00:40:55.570 - 00:41:37.658, Speaker B: Indeed. Well, extending even past this conversation. So at Optimism, we're trying to figure out we're doing this retroactive public goods funding stuff, we are taking our sequence of profits to pay for retroactive public goods and we're going to be doing some governance experiments to figure out who we are actually paying in the very near term. So what kinds of things would you like to see tested or what kinds of information would you like to learn about ways that we can kind of determine this retroactive public goods funding in these various governance experiments that we are.
00:41:37.744 - 00:42:25.770, Speaker C: Going to run, testing governance mechanisms that are not Coin voting is definitely something that's really important. Otherwise, I guess just letting the governance run and seeing what decisions it makes, right. One of their other nice things about retroactive funding is that it can just start making decisions immediately because you don't have to apply for retroactive public grids funding. Well, you can make a system where you have an application form, but then people can just apply other people as in the mechanism. And I think that's something that should happen. So they can basically just start going around and saying like, hey, here's a listed address of something that's provided some value to the community. Let's just go and give them a nice surprise.
00:42:25.770 - 00:42:34.800, Speaker C: So that's one of the things I'm excited about and you should be able to actually get some feedback fairly quickly.
00:42:36.050 - 00:42:44.910, Speaker B: So exciting. All right, well, okay, real one question should dows phone public goods?
00:42:47.010 - 00:42:47.760, Speaker C: Yes.
00:42:48.150 - 00:43:05.000, Speaker B: Okay, great. Okay, so now for some miscellaneous questions. These should hopefully be fun. First what is the importance of, quote, fun in mechanism design? You've said this to me a couple of times, that it's actually an underrated part of mechanism design. Fun.
00:43:05.930 - 00:43:57.880, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think people are more likely to enthusiastically participate in these mechanisms and keep coming back to participate if the mechanisms are fun to participate in. If the mechanisms there's fun in the participation, there's fun in just seeing what the results of everyone's participation put together turn out to be. In watching the discussion that comes to the results that are being made, the more that these things can be made into something that people actually want to follow and engage in, the more that they can actually not just to do public arts funding, but also even just be a community building tool.
00:43:59.150 - 00:44:21.790, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. That is definitely underrated thing. Okay, so now as a kind of end user, I feel like we're actually always working towards building a better Internet. But I'm curious, in your mind as an end user, what is the way that our interactions with the Internet will change if crypto is successful?
00:44:26.870 - 00:45:33.960, Speaker C: See, yeah, it's a good question. I feel like crypto is the way that crypto is going to succeed. If it succeeds, is it's not going to kind of worm its way into existing services, so much as there will be entirely new things that get created and those new things that get created are just going to be crypto native. Right. So for example, if this metaverse thing actually comes to fruition and we see some kind of decentralized world with objects that can talk to each other, like, that something that can all kind of happen on the blockchain. And your Ethereum wallet may well just be the way that you end up interacting with that. If DAOs are going to be responsible for giving everyone a crypto, UBI, then you're going to be using an Ethereum wallet to kind of sign up and actually receive those tokens and submit your profile and get it proof of humanity verified or whatever.
00:45:33.960 - 00:46:45.838, Speaker C: If there's a dow that's being used to create some stable coin or some DeFi or just any other financial thing, then once again, like an Ethereum wallet or what just will be something that you actually use to interact and hold your coins. Your identity will instead of being signed in with Facebook and sign in with Twitter, it can just be sign in with your crypto. Like, I think there will be a lot of these different kind of different little things. The differences between the crypto native things and the kind of centralized things that came before is that crypto native things will tend to emphasize interoperability much more. And the centralized world, I think, really selects for building empires. And the problem with building empires is that everyone wants to be the empire and so they end up really competing with each other. But the crypto world, I think, is going like the winners will be the projects that focus on building tools like do one thing, do one thing well, and build something that interacts with everything else.
00:46:45.838 - 00:47:22.540, Speaker C: So, like the Unix philosophy, except the Unix philosophy is stretching out across an entire community and controlling money and controlling pictures of monkeys and rocks. Okay, fine. I guess the Unix shell can technically control pictures of monkeys and rocks too, but they're not worth $3.4 million. Whatever the fun stuff is that the brave new crypto enabled meta world creates, I think blockchains are going to be a huge part of it.
00:47:24.110 - 00:47:54.450, Speaker B: So fun. So one of my favorite ideas recently has been that crypto is kind of creating a social network. Like, what we're doing is crypto, not just crypto, and also retroactive public goods funding. It's kind of like forming this basis for social interaction. So maybe one bit of social interaction is like, can crypto help fight misinformation or make sure that good valuable things get surfaced to us as we scroll through Twitter?
00:47:56.570 - 00:48:36.450, Speaker C: Just use retroactive public grids funding for that, right? You just give retroactive likes to say, tweets that actually still look good a year in the future. And hopefully if you kind of design social media in a way that has the incentives right, then you should be able to hopefully push people so that they start optimizing their behavior around that instead of optimizing around immediate engagement. And your ability to get like 500 outrage clicks before it turns out that the thing that you retweeted is actually completely false.
00:48:39.110 - 00:48:55.400, Speaker B: Great. Retroactive public goods funding solves everything. This is fresh off the press. Okay, yeah. Here's some fun ones. Okay. Is technology fundamentally empowering humans or are we losing control?
00:48:57.610 - 00:50:02.558, Speaker C: I definitely think that we're still far from losing control right now. What's the scenario where we lose control? The scenario where we lose control, the most obvious one, of course, is the unfriendly AI apocalypse, right? Where we just create an AI. And we tell it to cure cancer, but the AI realizes that the best way to cure cancer is to just turn us all into paperclips. That's one way in which we might lose control. Another way in which we might lose control is if offensive technology becomes progresses much more quickly than defensive technology. And you get these kind of one of these multipolar traps where just the number of groups that's capable of completely breaking civilization keeps on going up and up until eventually one of them does it. I think the only fix to that sort of thing ultimately is to just create more defensive technology, right? I think crypto is defensive technology.
00:50:02.558 - 00:50:16.900, Speaker C: Like, crypto is a way of building infrastructure so that even a high school noob can build an application that has extremely high grade resistance against Dossadex. That's just something that you fundamentally cannot do in the centralized world.
00:50:21.430 - 00:50:23.860, Speaker B: I agree. Keep going.
00:50:26.650 - 00:50:32.600, Speaker C: I'm not sure if I have anything more smart to say on that particular question. Right.
00:50:33.690 - 00:50:48.250, Speaker B: Well, I definitely agree. I do think that crypto is really creating our humanity in some ways or captivating cultivating our humanity. Okay, some more questions. Very important. Will we survive the heat death of the universe?
00:50:49.890 - 00:50:54.080, Speaker C: Interesting. I would say 50% yes.
00:50:54.930 - 00:51:00.910, Speaker B: Okay, great. Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of humanity?
00:51:06.070 - 00:52:39.440, Speaker C: I would say optimistic I think yay things that we could be optimistic about. And I think the kind of scientific and technology stagnation of the last couple of decades seems like it's coming to an end and we're really starting kind of the next great whoosh cycle of rapid advances in awesome stuff. And if you just think about the difference between a computer in 1950 and a computer in 2020, that's the difference I'm expecting between antiaging technology in 2020 and antiaging technology in 2090 and the difference I'm expecting between the technologies and a whole bunch of industries. Right? So if by the end of the century we're all just going to be 150 year old immortals hanging out on Mars and making backup copies of ourselves in the decentralized cloud and everyone's in post scarcity of luxury communism happy utopia, then that's like we've done it. I think there's definitely headwinds, right? Like there's kind of short term headwinds just in terms of world politics becoming massively less cooperative than it was ten years ago, for example. But ultimately I feel like those are things that humanity can get past.
00:52:43.250 - 00:53:12.646, Speaker B: Well, I'm glad you're optimistic. Very glad. And we also happen to be talking to a bunch of people who are about to do some great hacks and those hacks are going to all save humanity. And so what advice do you have for these hackers? And are there any projects that you're particularly interested in? The classic questions for a hackathon?
00:53:12.758 - 00:54:03.094, Speaker C: Yes. So one very important category for me actually is cross L2 Bridging infrastructure. Right now is exactly the time when the ethereum L2 ecosystem is really kind of coming into its own and moving from being theory to be something that exists in practice. And in order for the L2 ecosystem to work well, it has to be able to work across the different L2s, right? Like you can't go from being ethereum to having five different silos that don't talk to each other. And in order to avoid that world, there need to be ways to move assets between the roll ups. So that includes definitely tokens. Like any kind of token, it also includes NFTs.
00:54:03.094 - 00:54:45.830, Speaker C: I made a proposal for a way to move NFTs between roll ups quickly. So that would be like one example of something that someone could just implement. You actually could even use that exact proposal to implement a dex for moving tokens around, interestingly enough, but that's kind of a harder challenge. But just like making kind of cross roll up Bridging infrastructure that is decentralized and that does not require the user to either wait a week or touch the base chain is the Holy Grail here. So whatever you come up with and whatever you biddle is greater.
00:54:48.670 - 00:55:21.380, Speaker B: Yes. Plus one, by the way. I'm clearly a bit of a roll up Stan, so yeah, plus one. Please build these cross roll up bridges. So what advice do you have for these hackers? Building their projects, fulfilling their dreams? You clearly did a bit of a hack and your hack seems to be relatively successful. So you might actually have a bit of advice for people who want to create bitcoin magazine, the bitcoin magazines of the future.
00:55:22.630 - 00:55:53.600, Speaker C: I think the important thing is to just not give up after a weekend, to just keep going. And if there's a project that you're passionate about, kind of start building out your community and actually persist and keep doing it for a year, keep doing it for two years. And if you keep on persisting long enough, then eventually your project will kind of make it into the ethereum public consciousness and you'll have made it. Persistence is important.
00:55:54.930 - 00:56:02.880, Speaker B: Nice. And you seem to persist and be ever optimistic and full of ideas. How do you do it?
00:56:04.130 - 00:56:37.180, Speaker C: I don't know. How do you do it? Okay, if you were going to answer iced coffee, then that's not really transferable because my tea lately has all been decaf. But yeah, no, I know. Even without caffeine, you can still be optimistic. Like you just look at the world and don't look at the doomer voices kind of interpretation of the world and just see all the actually existing bright stuff.
00:56:38.910 - 00:57:14.360, Speaker B: That's beautiful. Okay. And I will say, okay, the way that I would do the optimistic and persistence thing is visualize what the future is going to be. Be excited, be curious and not take things too seriously because really, it all really matters, but it also doesn't matter that bad that much. So just don't take things too seriously. Enjoy. Go with the flow, listen to what other people say because you definitely don't know the right things.
00:57:14.360 - 00:57:18.810, Speaker B: That's really the move, to be honest with you.
00:57:18.880 - 00:57:24.140, Speaker C: Yeah, just go with the flow because you don't know. And that's the way to grow and move away from PO.
00:57:27.870 - 00:57:50.274, Speaker B: Yes. And also have many freestyle sessions walking around various neighborhoods. These are all great questions. Okay, so I have one final question. It's the most important question of all that we have asked so far. Everyone's been wondering since we started this. You don't have to tell me.
00:57:50.274 - 00:57:52.850, Speaker B: You don't have to send the question. I knew you had it.
00:57:53.000 - 00:58:15.210, Speaker C: The price of ETH will be $30,000, but I'm not going to tell you what currency that's denominated wait, did I say dollars? No, it's not what I meant. I meant it'll be 30,000, but I don't know what currency that's the joke. No. Did I screw up the joke? No, I screwed up the joke. Oh, no, I don't know what the price of equal be? It will be 30,000 something. It could easily be Venezuelan boulevards.
00:58:16.270 - 00:58:26.320, Speaker B: Okay, well, that was the other question. You already knew how to do that. But for our final questions what's up.
00:58:29.490 - 00:58:30.510, Speaker C: Ceiling?
00:58:30.850 - 00:58:43.620, Speaker B: Hey, thanks, y'all. Good luck hacking and shout out to East Global. All my peeps at East Global. That was a lot of fun.
00:58:45.350 - 00:59:12.462, Speaker A: Carl Vitalik. That was indeed a lot of fun. And I'm sure we'll rather talk sometime about our freestyle rap, so can't wait for that one. Thank you so much. Glad that you were able to talk about this thing and make this mean. I learned a lot of cool things, and I'm glad that we were able to cover not only just retroactive funding, but also all the other things in life that are important or maybe not important. So this is great.
00:59:12.516 - 00:59:14.686, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you.
00:59:14.868 - 00:59:15.600, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:59:16.610 - 00:59:21.530, Speaker A: Perfect. All right, so we are ready to move on to our next piece, which is me talking about all the prizes.
