00:00:06.010 - 00:01:00.634, Speaker A: And I started at East London two years ago just as a random guy walking up to a bunch of developers and being like, hey, I have this idea. And yeah, then it was a grind. Two years searching, finding, whatever, and then we officially launched Tucan in October the last year. Token really is building tools that allow people to embed regenerative actions into web3. I would say the goal really is to create an economic system that is in line with the planetary boundaries. So most of the economy today is based on extraction. And we want to make sure that the economy that is building on web3 or that is being built on web3 embeds regenerative practices in the core fabric.
00:01:00.634 - 00:02:18.522, Speaker A: And the fastest and easiest way for us that we found to do that is to bring carbon markets on chain and really harness the power and creativity in web3 and unleash that intelligence on the biggest problem that we have, which is the climate prices. So carbon markets essentially exist to put a price on carbon, which carbon emissions are negative, externalities and normally not really priced into cost functions of a company. And the voluntary carbon market exists. So basically to bring these two sites together, so you have projects that plant trees or embedded like regenerative agriculture or renewable energy projects. So they essentially produce positive actionalities that are then attested by carbon standards that are essentially NGOs that go there and check that the trees have actually been planted. So on the supply side, if you want, you have these positive externalities and then on the demand side, you have polluters that want to pollute or want to continue to pollute or are reducing their emissions, but not fast enough and want to compensate. So that's how carbon market exists today.
00:02:18.522 - 00:03:13.542, Speaker A: And there's a bunch of problems in that market. The biggest one is that it's super opaque, so there's a lack of transparency. There's even double counting of these carbon credits and there's no functioning spot market, so there's no price discovery. Most of the market is OTC. And so really what happens is that the middlemen in this market capture most of the value, right? So a carbon project, like I'm planting these trees and after two years I have these auditors that come, they check that these trees really grow and then they get issues issued, these carbon credits. And what they do is that they sell those carbon credits immediately to middlemen to then start planting more trees. And then there's a lot of speculation happening in this middle layer to connect that supply with the demand side, which are like polluters companies, et cetera.
00:03:13.542 - 00:03:51.240, Speaker A: And yeah, that's just like nobody really knows what happens in between. And what we did or what our objective is, is to remove the middlemen coming in. Oh my God. Cool. Toucan really is about removing these middlemen in this process, right? So it's about connecting directly the supply side to the carbon projects with the demand side. So that essentially a bigger chunk of the pie, more of the value lands in the hands of these projects. So the way we did this.
00:03:53.450 - 00:03:53.766, Speaker B: The.
00:03:53.788 - 00:04:21.390, Speaker A: Way we did this is that we allow owners of carbon credits to use toucan as an infrastructure to bring them on chain. So you have today carbon credits exist in off chain carbon registries. So essentially like centralized databases, it says Person A has 100 carbon credits, et cetera. And essentially token. What it does, it allows these owners of these credits to remove them from that registry and move them over to a blockchain. And then you have a token that represents that carbon credit.
00:04:21.460 - 00:04:21.646, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:21.668 - 00:04:59.210, Speaker A: And what's important is that this token is an ERC 20 token that comes with all the metadata attached. So it's a project from Brazil, forestry, whatever. And now the next step is that we so called carbon pools. So we now allow people to group similar types of assets into a carbon pool to create a deep liquid market for a certain category of carbon. Right? So we have two carbon pools that are currently live. One is called BCT, which is the base carbon ton, which is mostly renewable energy projects. And then there's NCT, which is the nature carbon ton which is only allowing for nature based projects.
00:04:59.210 - 00:05:01.180, Speaker A: And there's more coming.
00:05:02.350 - 00:05:05.614, Speaker B: So why do we care about this?
00:05:05.652 - 00:05:41.206, Speaker A: So what is better? Why tokenized carbon credits in the first place? There are a lot of benefits. The biggest one, obviously, it's programmable, it's composable, you can build on top of it. And really that's the biggest kind of premise in Tucan is empower other people to use carbon as a building block. And we've seen pretty cool projects already building on top of us in these different domains. So there's carbon backed Currencies Kimadao is one of them. But there's Fumo, which is a stablecoin project. There's another one in Stealth right now that is building also a stablecoin protocol on top of carbon.
00:05:41.206 - 00:06:25.586, Speaker A: There's Cello, which is backing their stablecoins with carbon assets, et cetera. So that is kind of this one spectrum is like using carbon credits as a collateral. And why is that interesting? It's interesting because it's an uncorrelated asset compared to most other crypto assets. Because it's a real world asset and everybody's super bullish on carbon. So essentially going long on carbon is probably a smart move. And this is no financial advice. The cool thing is Dow, Treasuries, et cetera, by holding some of their assets in carbon, they're obviously diversifying their portfolio.
00:06:25.586 - 00:06:41.466, Speaker A: But also what it does is that it creates a demand pool and increases the price for these carbon assets. And a higher price means more projects get developed on the supply side, which is ultimately what we want to achieve. So I always think of carbon as.
00:06:41.488 - 00:06:42.286, Speaker B: A collateral use case.
00:06:42.308 - 00:07:07.854, Speaker A: It's essentially we create economic carbon sinks. So carbon sinks today are essentially the ocean is a massive carbon sink, right? But what we can do by tokenizing carbon credits, we can create these economic carbon sinks where basically we lock carbon as a collateral into MakerDAO or whatever, right? And so the more people start using a currency which is backed by carbon, the more demand for the underlying asset is produced.
00:07:07.902 - 00:07:08.066, Speaker C: Right?
00:07:08.088 - 00:07:50.740, Speaker A: So it's essentially let's create the gold rush for carbon and let's hope that this has an impact. So other projects have been building like yield optimizers or essentially redirecting some of the yield towards burning carbon credits. Which I think is nice because essentially every time we produce value, I think it's a good way to redirect some of that value towards regeneration. We have projects that are built in the Metaverse. One of my favorite projects, Atlantis, they also hear they have like trees. Essentially their trees in the Metaverse are actually capturing carbon if you want. Right? So I tried to explain that to my grandma on Christmas and it didn't work.
00:07:50.740 - 00:08:39.198, Speaker A: But it would be cool if we could go back in 20 years time and look back on a safe planet to be like, you know, it's all these trees in the Metaverse that solves climate change. So maybe not. NFT projects using carbon, basically, let's gamify it, let's make it visible, let's make climate action the status symbol of this century because let's make it cool to do good. And our premise is let's make it as easy as possible for people to do good by having this building block and embedding it. What does regenerative by design mean? So we have extractive systems. I would say capitalism is a perfect example of an extractive system. A sustainable system is it extracts and it put as much back as it extracts.
00:08:39.198 - 00:09:31.940, Speaker A: And a regenerative system is that basically it puts back more into the environment that sustains us than we actually extract from it. Right? We all know that we're kind of at the edge of a big problem. I would say if you have read the IPCC report that came out yeah, some big numbers that are supposed to impress you. So the carbon market is growing super quickly. It's one of the best performing assets in the world. Token we have launched in October and since we bridged over 20 million credits on chain, had significant volume and I think we tokenized 5% of Vera's registry. Vera is the biggest carbon standard in the world.
00:09:31.940 - 00:09:48.520, Speaker A: So we definitely yeah, it went faster than we thought, let's put it that way. Which had some really positive things like me standing here and talking to you, but also really downsides because like scaling quickly in crypto generally, scaling quickly has its.
00:09:52.650 - 00:09:53.400, Speaker B: Mean.
00:09:53.710 - 00:10:40.682, Speaker A: That's actually the reason why we started. So when I went to East London two years ago, one of my biggest problems was that I love crypto. I've been in web3 for a while and all my friends and I are like environmentalists and it was always like this, how can you be in crypto? And I always wanted to say that climate change essentially is a coordination failure. Web Three is building coordination tools and so it's maybe the best tool that we have to address the problem. And there was no project to point to and say, look, they're doing it right. So that was one of the key motivations for me when I went to London two years ago to start this, essentially. And, yeah, the cool thing really is that we could build blockchains that are running like they're planet positive by design.
00:10:40.682 - 00:11:13.314, Speaker A: We could redirect some of the gas fees, et cetera. Twitch is burning carbon credits constantly and that's it. I don't think that's irrelevant. That's more like as a corporation, what do you do? So obviously the most important thing is start offsetting. Start reducing offsetting is not a replacement for reducing emissions, obviously. So I'm happy that Ethereum is going to proof of stake. That's the first thing to do and then remove the rest.
00:11:13.314 - 00:11:34.582, Speaker A: If somebody here wants to hack on offsetting, the historical footprint of Ethereum, please come and talk to me because that's the biggest clue and it's going to happen and I need more people. So, yeah, there is an app that you can check out, but Alex is going to talk more about the technical stuff. This is not the subject.
00:11:34.646 - 00:11:35.082, Speaker B: I know.
00:11:35.136 - 00:12:09.634, Speaker A: Perfect. So, no, just last thing, when people offset using or like when they retire a carbon credit on toucan you get a beautiful little certificate that allows you to track which projects, how much did you retire, et cetera, which hopefully was going to bring a little bit more transparency to this market. Yeah, I don't want to take too much time away from you, so I'll probably just I think it's the last slide.
00:12:09.682 - 00:12:09.942, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:12:09.996 - 00:13:06.006, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm bullish on this mostly because I think we can bring the next, you know, the next billion users coming to crypto might come through the climate topic, in my opinion, because this is so much more accessible for a lot of people and everybody talks about what's the killer app for crypto and blockchain. I think this might be one of the killer apps for sure, because the carbon market is Web One and we can just leapfrog directly to Web Three. And, yeah, it's happening. People in the traditional market are excited and scared, so there's a huge educational gap that we need to fill and we're working on that. But, yeah, I think this could be I mean, I need to wake up every morning and tell myself that we're not already doomed. So, yeah, there's hope and that's where.
00:13:06.028 - 00:13:07.190, Speaker B: I leave it to Alex.
00:13:08.650 - 00:14:03.610, Speaker D: Thank you for this beautiful introduction. What I wanted to present to you guys today is the offset helper, which is basically a way to abstract a lot of the steps that take you from USDC to offset CO2. And this project right here that you're seeing right now on the screen is something that we've built for Redemver, where it actually calculates how much CO2 you've emitted by doing transactions on chain. And then you can offset it. And it's using an early version of what I will be presenting to you right now, which is the offset helper basically to turn USDC. Because as Rafael just explained, one thing that we really want to incentivize is we want to incentivize want to make it easy for you guys to offset CO2. And you can build all sorts of DApps like the one I just showed on top of us.
00:14:03.610 - 00:14:35.570, Speaker D: But as a normal user, what you would have to do is you would have to buy USDC. You'd have to go to Sushi Swap and then replace that with BCT or NCT. You would have to come back to our website, redeem it for TCO Two, and then you could retire at Eco Two to achieve the actual offset. And obviously that's a few steps. And it's particularly quite a few steps if you're doing it programmatically because you would have to learn the Sushi documentation. You would have to go into our own documentation and learn a few of our contracts to be able to achieve this. So the easier we can make it, the better it's going to be for you guys.
00:14:35.570 - 00:15:16.906, Speaker D: And that's why we have the offset helper, which essentially takes all those three or four steps and abstracts them. And so instead of you having to learn all these contracts, you just look at the offset helper. It has a method called auto offset, you call that. And so long as you have USDC within either your wallet or the contract from which you're calling the offset helper, this is just going to take care of all of it for you. It's also obviously always updated with our newest infrastructure. Like, for example, one thing that's happening right now, we're bringing in NFTs on chain. So after you do it on offset, you're going to get an NFT for offsetting, which is supposed to not have actual value.
00:15:16.906 - 00:16:03.438, Speaker D: It's just a flex for you. Don't sell it, don't do anything with it. But yeah, we're going to update the offset helper to have that in mind so you don't have to keep updating your own systems to match with us all the time, which really makes your job as somebody that builds on top of Tucan much easier. Where can you find the offset helper? It's the developer. Tucan earth. This is a much shorter talk than the introduction. As you can see, guys, I can show you the actual code right here for the is it big enough for the offset helper? And you can see this is the main method you will be interacting with.
00:16:03.438 - 00:16:54.740, Speaker D: You're going to give the address of the deposited token, the address of the pool token. You want to use because you can actually use BCT or NCT and then you're going to give it an amount to offset and it's going to just take care of it all for you. It abstracts the whole process to these free methods which are down below. And this is the offset helper. You can actually offset using either two or you can use USDC Vmatic Ve. Yeah, because we've taken care of the swap with all these other tokens too. Any questions about this or how you may use it to build or ideas that you guys might want to use, like ideas that you have that you want to build on top of the offsetting process?
00:16:57.270 - 00:16:57.970, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:16:58.040 - 00:17:00.274, Speaker D: You have a mic actually there if you want to use it.
00:17:00.312 - 00:17:02.660, Speaker B: Can we use a mic? No, I don't think so.
00:17:05.110 - 00:17:22.780, Speaker E: Who means the stock? So there must be some organization which is buying the actual carbon offset from the authorities, EU or US or whatever, and then they need to lock it and then mean the token because otherwise it doesn't make any sense, right?
00:17:26.110 - 00:17:45.700, Speaker B: We operate in the voluntary carbon market, so these carbon credits are not issued by authorities. They're issued by so called carbon standards. Right now, the biggest one is Vera. They have like 75% market share, then gold standard and some smaller ones. These are essentially NGOs that.
00:17:48.150 - 00:17:48.674, Speaker C: Go to.
00:17:48.712 - 00:18:44.238, Speaker B: Projects that are planting trees or switching from conventional agriculture to regenerative agriculture or do renewable energy stuff. And they attest that. They have planted those trees and they basically will issue carbon credits for each ton of carbon that has been reduced or removed. So these credits now live in the Vera registry, which is a Web one database that has its challenges, let's put it that way. So the user, when they come into token, they basically delete it. They cancel the offset in this off chain registry and they move it onto sets. And when the token is minted so there's a process where if we go into detail, really what happens is that as a user, you go onto toucan you mint an NFT, which is called the empty batch NFT, which essentially represents a batch of carbon credits, which you're bringing on chain.
00:18:44.238 - 00:19:33.038, Speaker B: And that NFT, when it's created, there's a transaction hash, that hash plus some other metadata needs to be put into the Vera retirement process as a pointer towards the NFT, basically. And then this carbon offset has a serial number and that serial number is then stored in the NFT. So essentially we have two pointers. We have one pointer from on chain to off chain, which is a serial number, and we have one pointer from off chain to on chain, which is this transaction hash broke for the other side that connects the two, basically, right? And then it does no longer exist in web like in the world, basically. Now the single source truth for where this offset lives is on chain. No right now it cannot return. So it's a one way bridge.
00:19:33.134 - 00:19:44.118, Speaker E: Okay, so original system was supposed to generate this carbon offset point, which could be bought by, I don't know, big oil, big plastic, whatever.
00:19:44.204 - 00:20:25.506, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, our goal is to move away from this offsetting scheme because if you think about it, carbon offsets are packaged positive externalities. Somebody just doing something good. Somebody's going to come and check if you really did something good and then you're going to get a carbon offset. Right? And the only way as a society that we came up with how to use positive actionalities is to match it with some negative functionalities. So I think what we can do in crypto is actually find more interesting use cases for rewarding the good that a project is doing. Right? So by retiring a carbon credit, you.
00:20:25.528 - 00:20:26.866, Speaker A: Remove it from the market so you.
00:20:26.888 - 00:20:53.886, Speaker B: Can claim the underlying environmental benefit for you. But you don't have to claim that because you have polluted. You can just claim it because you want or because it gives you access to an onchain community or because you get a fancy NFT or whatever you want. That's I think, where we're going to see a lot of the innovation happening and what other ways can we come up with to incentivize the so if.
00:20:53.908 - 00:20:58.938, Speaker E: I do want to pollute, can I buy a token and then return it to the EU?
00:20:59.114 - 00:21:05.150, Speaker B: No, you don't have to forget all these has nothing to do with EU or any regulatory.
00:21:07.350 - 00:21:09.540, Speaker E: So why would anybody buy this?
00:21:10.310 - 00:21:11.934, Speaker B: Because they want offsets.
00:21:11.982 - 00:21:15.246, Speaker E: But I mean, I mean, this offsets from the Vera company.
00:21:15.368 - 00:21:26.646, Speaker B: Yeah, basically because of consumer pressure. Or because they want to do some good.
00:21:26.748 - 00:21:27.538, Speaker E: They want to do some good.
00:21:27.564 - 00:21:59.060, Speaker B: But honestly, mostly it's the cost of capital. So there's a lot of ESG money flowing around targeting specifically looking for companies that are carbon neutral or have a climate strategy. And it's just a lot easier. It's peer pressure, right? You have Microsoft, Google, Apple, they're all coming out and saying we're going to be carbon neutral, even historically, whatever. And then others feel like they have to do the same.
00:22:00.870 - 00:22:15.414, Speaker F: Once it's been retired of Vera, how do we continue to ensure that that carbon stored? Does Vera still continue to verify that? Is there a link there or what happens?
00:22:15.532 - 00:22:43.018, Speaker B: So when a project is certified and carbon credits are issued, a portion of that goes into a buffer pool, which is basically like an insurance scheme. Let's say some trees haven't planted and part of that forest burns down. Then that's when carbon credits from the buffer pool are basically also canceled to make up for that. So there's kind of like an insurance model within Barrack to account for that.
00:22:43.204 - 00:22:46.340, Speaker C: Is there a time insurance?
00:22:47.270 - 00:23:35.600, Speaker B: No, it's not really to be able to call yourself a carbon, a carbon credit has must have 100 years of permanence to be considered a carbon credit. But most credits today are so called avoidance credits, meaning that they replace new land, your project, for instance, they replace coal or this kind of stuff. The permanence is less of an issue because if it's been avoided once, it's been avoided forever, permanence becomes really an issue. For removal credits where carbon should be run down from the atmosphere and let's say stored in a tree, you have to make sure that the tree is still around for like 100 years at least.
00:23:37.090 - 00:23:39.150, Speaker F: So you don't have many of those ones.
00:23:39.300 - 00:24:21.246, Speaker B: There's still like globally there's a very limited amount of carbon removal credits because they are a lot more expensive and because this whole permanent thing has not really been figured out yet so much. We've been looking into creating a different accounting mechanism, which is based on year count. So basically by breaking up into years, you can say a tree averages out for like 30 years, for instance, right. And then you can get like 30 year terms for one credit, this kind of stuff. But it also has its brain was.
00:24:21.268 - 00:24:26.562, Speaker C: Just firing off there. I was like, yeah, it's not good enough because it's a starting point.
00:24:26.616 - 00:24:50.440, Speaker B: Right. Everything in this market is not good enough. Let's make it clear the value chain is completely broken. There's problems on the verification front, there's problems on the project finance front, there's problems in the market. There's problems on the market. So it's a big challenge to change all of that.
00:24:52.250 - 00:24:55.160, Speaker F: What problems are you seeing in the verification side?
00:24:58.030 - 00:25:26.562, Speaker B: The first one is that there's a bottleneck on the verification body. So that sheet backlog basically then largely manual. It's largely manual process. Like people are literally flying there and hugging trees to find out what the diameter is. Like really there's no technology used. There is problems, especially in the there's literally fraud in that. Meaning that the baselines are fake.
00:25:26.626 - 00:25:32.966, Speaker C: Meaning that my question is what's stopping Vera from being corrupted as well?
00:25:32.988 - 00:25:33.462, Speaker B: Right?
00:25:33.596 - 00:25:39.706, Speaker C: Because they're not this like institutional body. They're an NGO, but they're still but.
00:25:39.728 - 00:26:09.326, Speaker B: Reputation is the only currency, right? Sure. All they have is their reputation. And there were like a trillion current standards in the early two thousand s. And basically there's been like a filter, there's been a triage happening. And Barackle tenants are the ones that stick out because of their scientific rigor and this kind of stuff. They know that as a standard, they're only as good as their reputation. But to make it very clear, there's still a lot of dramatic projects in that rock.
00:26:09.326 - 00:26:10.434, Speaker B: They're not perfect.
00:26:10.552 - 00:26:12.370, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So I was going to be like.
00:26:12.440 - 00:26:59.838, Speaker B: You check them today. There's new projects that are coming online that are basically running almost like rating, rating credit. You have, like, AAA credits. But honestly, I think we need to go towards a more data driven approach. And I spent nine months in a venture builder in London looking at the whole value chain looking what the starting point is. We ended up building this first because it can create a pool to then allow other innovation to happen. So we need the infrastructure, we need the demand.
00:26:59.838 - 00:27:19.530, Speaker B: Full supply on chain. And now there's projects starting to work on drone based verification, satellite images and this kind of stuff. And if we can connect it to the Onchain registry that we built, and you have all that traceability baked into the token from the origin, that's when we're going to get better.
00:27:19.600 - 00:27:20.426, Speaker C: That's our idea.
00:27:20.528 - 00:27:21.900, Speaker B: Yeah. Please build.
00:27:24.350 - 00:27:37.294, Speaker C: Grain. I just wanted the other side of this. CO2 markets essentially get their value from you alluded to it. It's either peer pressure and or government tax pressure, right?
00:27:37.332 - 00:27:37.630, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:37.700 - 00:27:49.482, Speaker C: So down the line, we probably want to look at using these markets to keep applying such pressure because then it would be a virtuous cycle.
00:27:49.546 - 00:27:50.160, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:53.250 - 00:27:55.200, Speaker C: That's kind of most of the questions.
00:28:09.930 - 00:28:12.954, Speaker B: We have a booth downstairs also if you want to watch more about, like.
00:28:12.992 - 00:28:15.178, Speaker C: Will we be able to lean on you guys when we pack?
00:28:15.264 - 00:28:16.940, Speaker B: Yeah, we have four people.
00:28:17.870 - 00:28:33.082, Speaker D: We have five people at all times. Basically. It's basically from the morning to late at night. We have people around. There's going to be me at sometimes. There's Michales. He's also going to be here sometimes.
00:28:33.082 - 00:28:37.390, Speaker D: And there's other people too. Marcel. Oh, I didn't see Marcel.
00:28:37.470 - 00:28:37.714, Speaker C: Okay.
00:28:37.752 - 00:28:46.258, Speaker D: Marcel. Yeah. We're going to be around. We're going to help you out. When hacking anything you need, we can help you out.
00:28:46.344 - 00:28:59.378, Speaker C: Yeah, because I think it would be a huge undertaking, because I think the way you redeem the token, like you said, tokens are created equally. This itself would be a new token standard for you. If we do go down that route.
00:28:59.474 - 00:29:34.466, Speaker B: We have we're working with projects already that want to skip Vera and the others that have a bunch of data. And that's why we call it the Tweeted Meta Registry, because essentially we all need a way to keep track of who has how much. But it needs to be interoperable. Right. Like a carbon credit from Bearer, a carbon credit gold standard, or a carbon credit from whatever standard you're building needs to be able to transact and talk to each other away.
00:29:34.488 - 00:29:57.570, Speaker C: Your idea, but it would be to build an oracle that draws in satellite data that's immediately redeemable. I think you can literally stream such data to the resolution back garden and we can sweep.
00:30:01.190 - 00:30:02.062, Speaker B: Very deeper.
00:30:02.126 - 00:30:02.740, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:05.830 - 00:30:09.322, Speaker B: It'S not as easy. Like, satellite data itself won't cut it.
00:30:09.376 - 00:30:09.980, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:14.270 - 00:30:15.660, Speaker B: There'S a lot of work.
00:30:16.750 - 00:30:23.920, Speaker F: A separate question. I came in a bit late. Sorry about that. You mentioned something about nature based specific.
00:30:27.810 - 00:31:02.142, Speaker B: Yeah. Each current credit, when it's brought onto 210, it exists as a TCO Two. So there are different TCO Two S for each project in each minute. And so there's basically a list of attributes that attach to that project. So where is it? Et cetera. And then we have these carbon pools and they work a bit like a Berlin club or any sub in the world where you have a bouncer standing in front of the pool and says, you can get in, you can't get in. And so that pool only allows nature based TCO two S or carbon credits to be deposited into that pool to mint an entity.
00:31:02.142 - 00:31:40.516, Speaker B: The entity is the nature carbon cost. And the cool thing is you can go back so you can burn your entity to redeem any of the underlying TCO two S by holding entity. Essentially, it's a claim to any of the underlying carbon credits. So if you still want to offset or you want to redeem a specific project because you live in Peru and you really want to support projects in Peru, this is how you can do the NFT gets fractionalized in the process and the batch NFT bring them on chain.
00:31:40.628 - 00:31:43.972, Speaker D: There's two NFTs. He might be asking about the retirement NFT.
00:31:44.036 - 00:31:44.264, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:44.302 - 00:31:46.072, Speaker B: Which side of the supply? On the bridging part.
00:31:46.126 - 00:31:47.290, Speaker C: On the bridging part.
00:31:48.140 - 00:31:57.420, Speaker B: So we bring them on as like a batch of, let's say 100,000, whatever, and then that batch gets broken up into 20 tokens.
00:31:59.680 - 00:32:00.140, Speaker C: Nice.
00:32:00.210 - 00:32:03.936, Speaker B: Okay, so where does the value of.
00:32:03.958 - 00:32:15.008, Speaker E: The token come from? So if I understand correctly, if your tokenizer is offset, the company cannot use it and cannot use it to slot a green level of their product?
00:32:15.094 - 00:32:20.768, Speaker B: They can. They can, yeah, they need to burn it. If you retire, then they can redeem.
00:32:20.784 - 00:32:21.984, Speaker E: This web one version.
00:32:22.032 - 00:32:24.020, Speaker B: No, you can never redeem the web one version.
00:32:24.920 - 00:32:34.792, Speaker E: Okay, but it's enough for the Vera company not to sue them for fraud. If they buy the token, then burn it.
00:32:34.926 - 00:32:41.620, Speaker B: So if they buy a token and they burn it, they get a certificate that says, I have burned the carbon. I'm going to hire 100 on the.
00:32:41.630 - 00:32:45.900, Speaker E: Carbon and it's good enough to be able to color flow.
00:32:46.400 - 00:33:05.490, Speaker B: There's no sheer standards from that in the world, which is why it's really easy to innovate in that market. But it's also a mess. But yeah, at the end of the day, where does the value come from? The value comes from people thinking that it has value and paying a minus where it.
00:33:08.600 - 00:33:10.676, Speaker E: But in the future, this.
00:33:10.698 - 00:33:16.070, Speaker B: Is a web one market. Like, this is an existing market, right? Like, this existing demand for this type of stuff.
00:33:17.000 - 00:33:23.428, Speaker E: So you can already burn it. So it already has, like, parity with other markets.
00:33:23.444 - 00:33:47.196, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think everyone in the world would agree with that. There's still people that are skeptical of tokens and what the role of tokens in this market? So not everyone would say that the token is an equivalent, but there's enough people who agree with that. And our goal is to move the whole carbon market on chain. I think there's a real chance and destroy.
00:33:47.228 - 00:34:04.564, Speaker E: As many tokens in the process as possible because every distress token is a token which cannot be used to greenwash the products. Greenwash is maybe not the right word because if you're paying for the token, that means that in the end you're paying the pre planter with a very.
00:34:04.602 - 00:34:24.408, Speaker B: Long it's a result based finance mechanism. So burning a token means removing it from circulation. And there's a project that every time it gets carbon credits, they can automatically it's a marketplace.
00:34:24.504 - 00:34:26.876, Speaker C: At the end of the day, you.
00:34:26.898 - 00:35:07.850, Speaker B: Were talking about growth being a problem. Like, you kind of hit you said that you were onboarding so much carbon that it became a problem. What was the problem and how do you solve that? Yeah, I mean, it was more that we were a small team and we needed to keep the bridge working. Okay. Not enough seats, not enough people. So there's not an issue with not enough carbon being available from the voluntary market to come on chain? No. I mean, yes and no.
00:35:07.850 - 00:35:41.670, Speaker B: It's a problem especially for carbon removal because it's a supply constraint market. At the end of the day, the demand is bigger than the actual supply. And so a lot of the carbon removal projects are kind of sold out to like 2024, whatever, which is why we don't have a carbon removal time yet. So we're kind of working with people to source that to make sure that we have enough supply to have a liquid cool chain for that. But yeah, that's not good.
00:35:46.040 - 00:36:00.900, Speaker C: Do you have anything built into offset when your own on chain actions? Can you I guess, like, as part of this, there's some other compute going on and things like that?
00:36:00.970 - 00:36:40.244, Speaker B: Yeah. So what we do is that every time there is, which right now there's only one fee when you redeem underlying TCA, two from the pool, half of that fee or sometimes more than half that fee is used to burn carbon. And the same thing. We're thinking about introducing a small team of bridging and then we will basically automatically burn some of that part of that piece. So kind of leading by example to make sure that whenever we extract if.
00:36:40.282 - 00:36:46.490, Speaker D: You were asking about offsetting, like your own wallets transactions, that's what you're talking about.
00:36:48.060 - 00:37:28.630, Speaker B: But we're working on making that more transparent. We're the first users and we want to kind of every flight that we take, making sure that it's fully transparent, like how you can operate and essentially decor and creating an equivalent for that on chain would be amazing. And then also allow other dows, other protocols, et cetera, to adopt a similar standard to really like I mean, we're offsetting this event under.
00:37:30.600 - 00:37:31.136, Speaker C: Amsterdam.
00:37:31.168 - 00:37:49.850, Speaker B: That's the city that we're to we're trying to build a bit of awareness in the end of the which is really like come like two years ago, nobody gave. So there's definitely a mind change that is happening.
00:37:52.220 - 00:38:12.910, Speaker C: Before I came to retirement. So they're not necessarily burnt.
00:38:13.910 - 00:38:46.010, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, our goal is not to that would be great. Right. But honestly, there's two things we're right now, essentially the infrastructure layer and what you're talking about really is an inventive layer that can be built on top of. Right. So I would love if somebody was built like an NFT project, for instance, that only allows you to mint an NFT by burning carbon.
00:38:46.350 - 00:38:47.578, Speaker D: Somebody is doing that.
00:38:47.664 - 00:38:50.894, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. But there can be many more, right?
00:38:51.092 - 00:38:52.560, Speaker D: I know, at least a few.
00:38:55.970 - 00:39:11.780, Speaker B: This way we can create incentives for people to do that. Right. But it's not our job to create the ultimate incentives right now. Our job is to make it easy for others to build to create these incentives and be in NFTs and the Metaverse and whatever.
00:39:12.550 - 00:39:13.780, Speaker C: That's pretty amazing.
00:39:14.730 - 00:39:42.560, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really cool, man. I can't wait to also web3 gaming and stuff. It'd be cool if you could have even in minecraft or these kind of things there were like special icons that you can only get if you burned like 1000 carbon or this kind of stuff. Right. Just ultimately, what do people value and what are people willing to pay for?
00:39:46.390 - 00:39:47.118, Speaker C: Creative?
00:39:47.214 - 00:40:48.100, Speaker B: You can get really creative. You know Simona simona Pop, who is like she's like one of the core organizers of a lot of these conferences and she was a jury at East London where after months or so we talked and she wanted to like I don't remember what it was basically what about sending her flowers, virtual flowers? And then we had the idea like cool if you could actually send virtual flowers as like a gift or something like that to people and that you could use to offset growing flowers. I don't know. There's definitely room for funny things that are consumer facing. Gamify it and just make it fun and make it easy. Yeah, it's really a bet on that.
00:40:49.690 - 00:40:54.118, Speaker E: One more question for the sake of the new 60 people on which blockchain that you are.
00:40:54.204 - 00:41:05.046, Speaker B: We are right now on Polygon. We're deploying a part of the stack on setup and we're looking to be on other chains.
00:41:05.078 - 00:41:12.094, Speaker E: So there is no proof of work involved. There's no proof of work. That's good because that would be like the first criticism toward your project.
00:41:12.212 - 00:41:44.598, Speaker B: Tell me about it. We are discussing if we should bring some of the entity. For instance, the biggest stack is the bridge, like all these different things. And then at the top of it you have these pool tokens and we're discussing whether or not we want them on east because projects like Maker have very clear strategy towards clean money, et cetera. There's a bit of like you want.
00:41:44.604 - 00:41:46.390, Speaker C: To enable the Dow to do collapse.
00:42:02.880 - 00:42:20.070, Speaker E: So I think that there are some protocols built on top of your protocols. I think that yesterday was yesterday on the shelling point there was a talk from a project who was, I think, using your tokens for something, but I couldn't grab the idea because I didn't know the base.
00:42:20.440 - 00:42:22.150, Speaker B: What was the project, you remember?
00:42:23.730 - 00:42:42.690, Speaker E: It could be, I think that they were trying to create these dows which would use the carbon tokens in order to incentivize change in their own proximity. I'll need to look up the schedule. I really cannot remember that many details.
00:42:45.050 - 00:43:04.460, Speaker B: I don't have the list of all, but there's like 50 or 40 50 projects on Suspense. Also, like lending. You can take a loan out against department, but not enough not enough protocol yet.
00:43:07.230 - 00:43:35.124, Speaker C: So you made it, so it's not your job. Is there anyone building, like I mean, one amazing aspect would be, like, one performance. I mean, let's say that British Airways have a public address where and where they acquire maybe?
00:43:35.162 - 00:44:35.780, Speaker B: Or are they really like, that would be great. Not yet. No, I don't think so. What Alex touched on so when you offset I don't want to call it Offset because offsetting has this compensation when you retire a credit, right? For whatever reason, you get an NFT certificate that says I can specify for what we meant, like an NFT for offsetting. East Amsterdam. And there's the possibility to build an aggregator on top of that, basically kind of sucking in that data and these different NFTs and saying, look, that airline, for instance, like, if you imagine has Offset or retired enough credits to call themselves carbon neutral, positive, whatever claim they want to make. But obviously you need the real world data on that, like polyfarm.
00:44:38.120 - 00:44:45.750, Speaker E: So this program is called Region Network. Yes.
00:44:47.800 - 00:44:52.976, Speaker B: They're not building on top of us. We're partnering with them directly.
00:44:53.008 - 00:44:53.792, Speaker E: Your token.
00:44:53.936 - 00:45:10.030, Speaker B: They want to they want to launch they want to basically so they're in the Cosmos ecosystem and they want to launch Entity, the Nature program on Cosmos using Zucat. We're collaborating on this one.
00:45:12.040 - 00:45:20.170, Speaker C: Technically, when you retire the token no.
00:45:21.900 - 00:45:34.972, Speaker B: It'S a minus one. So we don't send them to the zero address because we want to keep track of we want to make sure that the post supplied. In fact, it's not possible.
00:45:35.026 - 00:45:43.440, Speaker C: If you try to send from zero address, the contract would say no. Okay. They get actually burned.
00:45:47.460 - 00:45:48.770, Speaker B: Some people did that.
00:45:51.540 - 00:45:55.236, Speaker C: We can use this functionality. We can call your offset function. Yeah.
00:45:55.338 - 00:46:07.418, Speaker B: So you can either call the burn require function directly in the CPU contract, or you can use the offset helper, which will link a lot easier. Sweet. Yeah.
00:46:07.584 - 00:46:08.300, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:46:08.910 - 00:46:11.420, Speaker B: I probably have to say it with two bounties up.
00:46:12.450 - 00:46:12.862, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:12.916 - 00:46:15.054, Speaker D: It's a free K and a five K one.
00:46:15.092 - 00:46:15.680, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:16.290 - 00:46:18.142, Speaker B: As you see, there's not many people in here.
00:46:18.196 - 00:46:22.510, Speaker C: Yeah. MoneyGram.
00:46:24.230 - 00:46:25.860, Speaker B: Maybe I'll go back.
00:46:28.950 - 00:46:34.070, Speaker C: Might be a bit of a but like, what's what's token's business model? How do you guys keep going?
00:46:34.220 - 00:46:46.006, Speaker B: So right now, the only business model that we have is that when somebody wants to redeem a specific carbon credit out of a pool that there is.
00:46:46.028 - 00:46:51.718, Speaker C: A fee attached to, that disincentivizing them from taking the crane liquefying the pool?
00:46:51.814 - 00:47:00.640, Speaker D: No, we're disincentivizing them to pick the TCO two. You can do it automatically and you get like the lowest quality TCO Two s and that's free.
00:47:01.570 - 00:47:03.710, Speaker C: The oldest credits can get them.
00:47:03.780 - 00:47:35.594, Speaker B: So an entity, right, like, let's say entity has one that's valuable, they kind of lose value with harm. So you have NCT, which has a vintage cut of 2012. So you cannot put in credits that are older than 2012. And that acceptance criteria gets updated every year. So next year is going to be 2013, et cetera. So we want to incentivize people to burn. Like if you want to want to retire, we want to incentivize them to take the oldest one, which is still free.
00:47:35.594 - 00:48:10.500, Speaker B: But if they want to pick a specific project from like 2019, 2020, whatever, then we make the second and we have the code live to have a bridge fee, but we haven't put it in place yet. And we're kind of discussing how we want to put it in place and if we want to put it in place. And it might be dynamic, it might be that there's still a free option. But if you want to bridge it super quickly, then you pay extra. Right, right. Also.
00:48:15.300 - 00:48:17.024, Speaker C: Certain bridges as well, right?
00:48:17.142 - 00:48:17.810, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:18.980 - 00:48:22.800, Speaker C: Maybe someone wants to bridge to like a proof of work chain.
00:48:23.220 - 00:48:29.812, Speaker B: Oh, that's not possible right now. We built a bridge, but we decide.
00:48:29.876 - 00:48:43.810, Speaker C: Right now where we thought, I mean, everybody could do like a wrap token working on that. There would probably also be no meaningful liquidity.
00:48:44.390 - 00:48:58.426, Speaker B: And right now we're still token is a Swiss nonprofit and there's no token token yet, but um, there's a clear press towards translation, I gotta say.
00:48:58.448 - 00:49:00.010, Speaker C: Wear wet haircrop.
00:49:02.350 - 00:49:02.854, Speaker B: Drop.
00:49:02.902 - 00:49:03.500, Speaker C: That.
00:49:11.730 - 00:49:13.600, Speaker B: Might be some I don't know.
00:49:22.900 - 00:49:30.120, Speaker C: How much for a price. Yeah.
00:49:30.190 - 00:49:44.270, Speaker B: So it's hard to tell because there's no transparency on that off chain price. Right. It's not like we always know at this point in time. Like this is like this arbitrage or whatever.
00:49:46.000 - 00:50:01.680, Speaker E: Aren't the companies themselves known as dark markets? Don't they provide the arbitrage, which is necessary? Because if the tokens are cheaper, then you're going to buy tokens and up of the value. Right, so they are going to do the arbitrage themselves.
00:50:01.830 - 00:50:14.820, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, right now there's an arbitrage opportunity one way. Right. So when the token trades at a higher price on chain, then you can buy the credits for off chain. Then there's a clear incentive to move them on chain.
00:50:15.400 - 00:50:15.860, Speaker C: Really?
00:50:15.930 - 00:51:10.600, Speaker B: This is our model to get supply on chain. That's real. This is about we need to make it attractive to people to move on chain. So that's just how supply demand works. But right now, if the prices on chain are lower than the price off chain, you cannot go back, but you can have all the functionalities that you would have off chain on chain. So really like there's not really a big reason to go back. If you agree that the on chain token has the same value as your PDF certificate that you would get from Vera and that's an educational and lobbying and we have people working on that specifically and also working on a like basically abstract all the on chain stuff away for corporates and just pay with the API.
00:51:12.140 - 00:51:15.900, Speaker C: I guess the risk is not that the token price goes lower on chain.
00:51:16.720 - 00:51:28.808, Speaker B: That's not a risk. That's not a risk because if it goes higher on chain, there's people that are smart enough, then they got tokenize new supply and dump.
00:51:28.984 - 00:51:29.710, Speaker C: Okay?
00:51:31.120 - 00:51:50.310, Speaker B: If the price goes to 100, I can tell you I will go buy some carbon credits at $10 and I will tokenize it and I will sell it to the pool and I will bring the price back down. That's how 20 million credit was landed on because there was a clear incentive for them to do that.
00:51:50.680 - 00:52:01.640, Speaker E: So which author didn't teach in order for them to respect the tokenized version and 20 token versions equivalent to the regular.
00:52:02.140 - 00:53:02.904, Speaker B: So yesterday we became member of Aeata, which is the International Emissions Trading Association, which is basically like a meta organization where all the carbon standards are also part of. So we're doing heavy education in there. We have some people that are super fan. We have some people that are super skeptical of tax innovation. So there's a big discussion happening right now. Ultimately the market is going to decide, right, if corporates agree that this has the same value, then it has the same value. So our strategy there is like the reality is that today most of the people who sell carbon credits, they have to secure the supply because there's no spot mark, right? So how it works that if you're a retailer, carbon retailer, you need to have a team that sources carbon credits, right? So you have three, four people, they have relationship projects.
00:53:02.904 - 00:53:25.104, Speaker B: They're going to do forward contracts with me just to make sure that you have some supply and you have that supply in stock. So you have to front the capital. So it's quite the capital attendance job. So what happens is that most of the retailers have like three projects that they can offer you or maybe five. And the big ones have like 50. Now that on chain. Essentially it's a warehouse carbon that is always accessible.
00:53:25.104 - 00:53:39.050, Speaker B: Twenty four, seven. So by making it easy for these retailers that already have relationships with customers and corporates, et cetera, to tap into that on chain supply, that's a huge benefit for them, right.
00:53:39.420 - 00:54:00.960, Speaker E: Globally, reduce the price of carbon offset, won't it, in global perspective, reduce the price of carbon offset because now the market can be more efficient. So now the prices are going to be lower. So that means that it will be cheaper to buy actually I don't know offset of ten tons and slack it on my pack of jeeps.
00:54:02.260 - 00:54:12.004, Speaker B: Yeah, that's okay. Because the same amount of money would go to the project. Right. So if the price goes lower, it means that there's less intermediaries which have right.
00:54:12.042 - 00:54:15.236, Speaker E: So the money goes closer to the.
00:54:15.258 - 00:54:46.140, Speaker B: People who are actually but also I think that we need higher prices. We need higher prices to have a bigger demand pool for more projects being developed. So our thesis is by making it easy and finding new sources of demand also within crypto and these economic harbor things that I've had that hopefully will push prices up which will mean that more projects get developed.
00:54:47.200 - 00:55:28.550, Speaker C: I only take problem with that just a little bit because we're again forcing an externality on developing nations. They still need to consume energy, right? Because they're developing nations like the consumption of energy is good up until a certain point and then over that is overconsumption. But all across that curve in consumption infrastructure I haven't really thought about it too much, but just on the surface when I think of carbon prices going up, I think why? Because aren't they going to be paying the price for these carbon as well?
00:55:29.020 - 00:55:36.920, Speaker B: It's a voluntary market so they don't have to pay that right, that's true. The developing nations are in a prime position to produce carbon.
00:55:38.860 - 00:55:40.936, Speaker C: This is why I think our idea is so good.
00:55:41.038 - 00:55:42.520, Speaker B: Huge business in Brazil.
00:55:43.280 - 00:55:55.744, Speaker C: That's exactly what I said earlier. Because if you can make this incentive layer at least equal to or greater than the value it costs to graze the land and sell beef, then you.
00:55:55.782 - 00:56:25.130, Speaker B: Immediately still have deforestation. Exactly right. Honestly, we need the developing countries to go from directly jump over coal right into renewables. But then you finance for that. So this is a source of finance. Right. Because that can be like essentially when you develop whatever renewable energies or whatever, you can get carbon credits because it replaces something.
00:56:25.130 - 00:56:35.500, Speaker B: It's a form to help the developing countries essentially to move to lead problem right into a more clean way of growing.
00:56:38.640 - 00:56:46.908, Speaker F: And then as you said before, they could use these carbon credits as collateral and to raise other money to fund other projects.
00:56:47.004 - 00:57:03.776, Speaker B: Exactly that's another thing is that today carbon projects are mostly forced to sell their inventory to finance future. Exactly. But if they can use it as a collateral to get out a loan, they can basically go long on carbon.
00:57:03.808 - 00:57:07.620, Speaker F: Themselves allowing us to have natural capital.
00:57:11.560 - 00:57:51.008, Speaker B: Seller finance wants to ramp their collateralization the rate of natural capital currencies up to 40% cello. It's like a layer one. Actually they're becoming L2 anyway. So that means like 40% of their stablecoins can be backed by natural capital currencies. Right now I think it's a billion worth of stable coins that they have in circulation. So there's 400 million of demand for natural capital currencies just from fellow and we know that MakerDAO has this clean money thing but they have no clue.
00:57:51.024 - 00:57:51.990, Speaker E: How to do it.
00:57:53.560 - 00:58:16.270, Speaker B: But I really like the idea of if you can choose in which stable coin you transact and you know that one stable coin is backed 40, 50 even the 100% by green assets. Essentially you can make a choice which stablecoin to hold your stuff in, which directly creates an impact and has that.
00:58:17.120 - 00:58:21.592, Speaker C: Speedo is effectively arbitrary because they should be equally liquid.
00:58:21.736 - 00:58:24.844, Speaker B: Exactly. Hopefully they are as liquid and as.
00:58:24.882 - 00:58:29.196, Speaker C: Useful as I understand, which is then it's like then it is actually a choice.
00:58:29.388 - 00:59:02.952, Speaker B: Yeah, like 500 total to buy and we'd never hold the pack. I love this, but there's a long way to get to the hardest part is on the MRB, the monitoring, reporting, verification. Right. Because that's where a lot of the challenges lie.
00:59:03.096 - 00:59:12.590, Speaker C: Yeah. Just as more interesting question, where do you guys generally stand on nuclear energy?
00:59:13.520 - 00:59:21.230, Speaker B: So I personally put this on two can, but I'm half German and half French, so it's a really good question.
00:59:22.240 - 00:59:23.630, Speaker C: It's the best question.
00:59:25.240 - 01:00:11.616, Speaker B: I personally think it was a mistake from Germany to move out of nuclear before moving out of coal. Ideally we don't need either of them. But if I have to pick, I would pick nuclear. At this point in history, obviously France is putting a lot of their nuclear raid to Russia, which is another externality you were saying that it's basically just dumped somewhere. So I'm not saying that I'm pro nuclear or something like that, but we try to be realistic as much as we can and the reality is that we don't have a lot of time to solve the climate crisis. So we will solve the climate crisis within a capitalist system. That's it.
01:00:11.616 - 01:01:10.950, Speaker B: We're not going to change the system to solve the climate cris first. I do think that we need to change capitalist system to a certain extent in order to really have a regenerative economy worldwide. But right now we just need to pump a lot of money to the global south basically and make sure that it lands in the hands of the right people to incentivize the right things. And right now, basically we don't have the infrastructure. I tried to wire money to Brazil the other day. You can't do fucking bank transfer to Brazil easily. How are you going to do good climate finance? Like a specific project in the jungle? Yeah, exactly.
01:01:10.950 - 01:01:27.400, Speaker B: This is why Dai and Tetra is huge in Argentina because just a stable coin is like a mind blowing innovation is actually stable compared to the local currency. Plus it's like literally the money.
01:01:27.550 - 01:01:35.624, Speaker C: So I'm president of the Oxford group that are here today and our budget for this was getting wired.
01:01:35.672 - 01:01:38.270, Speaker B: Hey, we're talking regeneration, man.
01:01:39.440 - 01:01:40.910, Speaker E: Is it late to finish?
01:01:43.120 - 01:01:45.452, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you want to join?
01:01:45.516 - 01:01:46.450, Speaker C: Yeah, why not?
01:01:47.700 - 01:01:55.470, Speaker B: Hey, are you doing a workshop?
01:01:56.530 - 01:02:32.220, Speaker E: No, you're doing a workshop. I just wouldn't like I mean, do you already have, like, idea for the prices? Because it's like we are thinking to do the bridge thing, but the two way okay. Yeah, the two way bridge for rather than qualify. Yeah, I mean, doing the doing basically the method stand up.
01:02:37.710 - 01:02:38.780, Speaker C: I would say.
01:02:39.790 - 01:02:43.130, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, it's building the prices.
01:02:45.550 - 01:02:45.866, Speaker C: I.
01:02:45.888 - 01:02:51.010, Speaker B: Guess expanding the seeking infrastructure, which that probably would fall under that it's building with carbon.
01:02:54.390 - 01:03:00.900, Speaker E: So the idea would be then, for example, to do it with Egmont and then let's say deploy your contract on Egmont. Okay.
01:03:04.310 - 01:03:07.474, Speaker B: You're wearing a region T shirt, right? Yeah. Are you from Region?
01:03:07.522 - 01:03:07.830, Speaker C: Yes.
01:03:07.900 - 01:03:16.620, Speaker B: Good. Gregory is it will be deploying it on EPMOs and then moving into region lender or what's the plan?
01:03:17.150 - 01:03:30.022, Speaker E: What's our plan? What is our plan otherwise but for a hackathon?
01:03:30.086 - 01:03:32.058, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah, please, let's do it.
01:03:32.064 - 01:03:33.459, Speaker E: Because it's a yeah.
01:03:33.459 - 01:03:38.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I would love that. Maybe it's even easier, man.
01:03:42.150 - 01:03:47.250, Speaker C: Excellent. Any excellent.
01:03:49.110 - 01:03:57.460, Speaker E: Thank you very much. Yeah, why not?
01:03:58.790 - 01:04:00.180, Speaker C: I mean, we made, like.
01:04:02.430 - 01:04:19.950, Speaker E: Meters of checking with gravity and approach is just and the lower overcast because they do handle the whole consensus without adding additional icon verification on the different chains. So once they have it, they already are connected to all EVM chains.
01:04:22.850 - 01:04:29.760, Speaker B: I haven't looked into long reading list of nomads advocates. Layer zero.
01:04:30.450 - 01:04:32.900, Speaker E: You know what's the problem with the long list?
01:04:33.750 - 01:04:37.570, Speaker B: I mean, it just like it just gets longer. I mean, everybody likes.
01:04:39.270 - 01:04:41.090, Speaker E: When you already have a long listing.
01:04:41.590 - 01:04:54.220, Speaker B: Yeah. It's impossible to every day there is something new. Um, one. Yeah.
01:04:54.590 - 01:04:55.050, Speaker C: Cool.
01:04:55.120 - 01:04:56.220, Speaker B: I love it.
01:04:58.350 - 01:05:00.140, Speaker E: Yeah. How are you?
01:05:00.510 - 01:05:26.034, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. Who wants to hack? I mean, it would be cool to maybe not have mode of competition. Yeah. I don't know. If three teams compete for the first prize and then only one team gets it. I think if all teams submit something really valuable, it should be important that we kind of reward everyone.
01:05:26.152 - 01:05:27.140, Speaker B: That's cool.
01:05:29.770 - 01:05:31.110, Speaker C: Not T shirt.
01:05:32.090 - 01:05:45.000, Speaker B: I want to see you guys last project standing. So we decided so we have two prizes, right? So we decided to just do one prize of eight k.
01:05:49.150 - 01:05:50.410, Speaker F: More prizes.
01:05:51.790 - 01:06:01.710, Speaker B: I don't know where the two prizes think, like I think it was kind of very, like, off the cuff. No, I think they kind of gave that as, like, we are allowed to do two prices, but I mean, probably.
01:06:01.780 - 01:06:03.246, Speaker C: You could have done ten prices, but.
01:06:03.268 - 01:06:04.960, Speaker B: It'S like is that true?
01:06:07.330 - 01:06:08.080, Speaker E: Okay.
01:06:09.110 - 01:06:12.338, Speaker C: But in the end, I think even with the prices, we can yeah.
01:06:12.344 - 01:06:13.570, Speaker B: I mean, we'll be creative.
01:06:16.150 - 01:06:26.120, Speaker C: Everybody wants to build something cool. And also, I think with East Amsterdam or ETH events, you have some sponsor amount, and only, like, share of that is actually price money.
01:06:30.170 - 01:06:35.850, Speaker B: Is a different bill. You have to pay the sponsor thing and then you also wire.
01:06:36.590 - 01:06:38.140, Speaker C: Yeah, it's not the same amount.
01:06:39.230 - 01:06:41.020, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. The price money is left.
01:06:46.270 - 01:06:47.242, Speaker F: Where are you guys?
01:06:47.296 - 01:06:48.250, Speaker E: There's rumors.
01:06:49.310 - 01:06:50.860, Speaker B: Of course we're working.
01:06:55.330 - 01:06:57.760, Speaker D: The vote is on the far right.
01:06:58.370 - 01:07:00.322, Speaker B: Just right on the stage, basically.
01:07:00.456 - 01:07:00.850, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:00.920 - 01:07:06.020, Speaker B: It's really nice when you want to see it. It's really a shit show if you want to actually get there.
01:07:11.110 - 01:07:12.654, Speaker C: To where that debate is.
01:07:12.792 - 01:07:14.040, Speaker F: Are you going to be there?
01:07:15.130 - 01:07:16.760, Speaker D: I'm going to be around the same.
01:07:17.450 - 01:07:18.610, Speaker E: Are you having a booth?
01:07:18.690 - 01:07:19.366, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:19.548 - 01:07:20.326, Speaker C: Okay.
01:07:20.508 - 01:07:22.118, Speaker E: That's an amazing right?
01:07:22.284 - 01:07:26.134, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just right of the big beach. Like just right on the side.
01:07:26.172 - 01:07:26.374, Speaker C: Okay.
01:07:26.412 - 01:07:28.410, Speaker B: You'll see this says Carbon on chain.
01:07:30.430 - 01:07:36.640, Speaker C: I guess another question is, like, okay if we wanted to work with you guys later down the line, like career wise? Yeah.
01:07:37.730 - 01:07:40.270, Speaker B: We don't hire, like nobody.
01:07:43.170 - 01:07:44.880, Speaker C: I was like, you had me there.
01:07:46.050 - 01:07:57.022, Speaker B: No, there's like 25 plus open positions, I guess. Plus there's grant program. If you don't want to work for us, but you want to work alongside.
01:07:57.086 - 01:08:00.470, Speaker C: Us, and there's an open apply.
01:08:00.620 - 01:08:02.246, Speaker D: If you don't find a position that.
01:08:02.268 - 01:08:03.142, Speaker C: Fits you, just apply.
01:08:03.196 - 01:08:46.846, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, we're hungry for talent, really, like, everyone, because everyone here. This is a hiring event, but we have a grand program with Coinbase for projects that are getting just off the ground. We have another grant program with Stella, which is much bigger for projects that build on two can. And then there is a venture ecosystem venture Arm that is kind of developing right now for actually supporting projects in house one. Yeah, we're building this up right now. We just closed around and there was much more interest than we could I'll.
01:08:46.878 - 01:08:52.370, Speaker C: Be totally interested in helping with that. Yeah, big time. Well, I finished my PhD in October.
01:08:52.450 - 01:08:53.302, Speaker B: You've got a bit longer.
01:08:53.356 - 01:08:54.182, Speaker C: Way to go.
01:08:54.316 - 01:08:58.774, Speaker F: But I'm doing PhD in H based solutions to climate change.
01:08:58.812 - 01:09:20.510, Speaker B: Oh, really? There's also ways to get involved that are not like 100% right. Like building out contributor program. Also that is more loose. So you're just a contributor, but you're not like yeah, exactly. And then you just pay the token.
01:09:21.810 - 01:09:23.360, Speaker C: When the drop comes.
01:09:26.690 - 01:09:28.274, Speaker B: You don't do AirDrop. Why not?
01:09:28.392 - 01:09:29.122, Speaker E: Don't do it.
01:09:29.176 - 01:09:29.442, Speaker B: Why?
01:09:29.496 - 01:09:30.674, Speaker C: Don't do it.
01:09:30.872 - 01:09:35.006, Speaker E: Just speculation games and you won't get any users.
01:09:35.198 - 01:09:36.606, Speaker B: I think it's more about rewarding.
01:09:36.638 - 01:09:41.862, Speaker E: Like, it's about building your community for marketing or whatever.
01:09:41.996 - 01:09:43.800, Speaker C: It depends on how you select.
01:09:45.290 - 01:09:57.980, Speaker E: Add more, like grants, small grants from creating a poster, media content, YouTube video, whatever.
01:10:02.270 - 01:10:20.050, Speaker B: This is the superstar behind. I walked into Adam two years ago at East London and I pitched this idea. Like, in the corner there's a bunch of people that didn't have a project yet. And that's where I ran into Adam.
01:10:20.470 - 01:10:23.140, Speaker C: And I said, that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
01:10:23.510 - 01:10:25.460, Speaker B: I need to come in and fix it.
01:10:27.830 - 01:10:28.580, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:10:35.030 - 01:10:43.420, Speaker B: We'Re like 28. 29 engineers. How many engineers do you have, Marcel? How many do we have?
01:10:43.790 - 01:10:44.540, Speaker C: Nine.
01:10:47.710 - 01:10:48.460, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:10:49.310 - 01:10:51.338, Speaker C: Just leaving right now. Okay.
01:10:51.504 - 01:10:53.260, Speaker B: There's a lot of stuff to build out.
01:10:54.850 - 01:10:56.590, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you guys have a roadmap?
01:10:57.090 - 01:10:59.434, Speaker B: We do have a roadmap. Now we just go loading.
01:10:59.482 - 01:11:02.714, Speaker C: Yeah. Consulted.
01:11:02.762 - 01:11:20.094, Speaker B: Sometimes I just heart joking, right. Until we closed the fundraise, it was basically we just bootstrapped. So you're really just thinking in terms of, like, two months ahead, three months ahead, maybe, and we actually just have a Token.
01:11:20.142 - 01:11:27.030, Speaker E: If you didn't have the funding, then we were like, what, self providing? Sorry, if you didn't have the Token, you didn't have the founding.
01:11:27.690 - 01:11:30.040, Speaker B: Yeah, we were, like, eating pasta a lot.
01:11:30.490 - 01:11:31.570, Speaker C: Living in tents.
01:11:31.650 - 01:11:50.108, Speaker B: Yeah, living in tents. No, but I mean, let's be real, though. The bull market helps, and there's been little bounties, like little stuff prices that we have along the way that helps us.
01:11:50.274 - 01:11:50.990, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:11:51.460 - 01:12:31.660, Speaker B: Eventually, he broke my ball. There was rap because my laptop was terrible. And then we were, like, doing zoom calls and stuff like that, doing screen share, and Adam was having to wait for it, and it turned out it was rough. Can you please use this price money to buy yourself new laptop? But yeah, it turned out well. I'm happy that we waited so long, basically, because we could raise, like, we raised it, like, a really good valuation, and we only had to give away very little amount of the Token network equity or no Token. No equity.
01:12:33.600 - 01:12:39.980, Speaker C: You guys going to be building? We hope so. I'm trying to keep them on edge.
01:12:45.600 - 01:12:46.024, Speaker E: Also.
01:12:46.082 - 01:12:49.260, Speaker B: We were just trying to figure out where the booth goes down the road.
01:12:49.430 - 01:12:52.544, Speaker E: Yeah, actually, you don't know. You don't have a Destin version.
01:12:52.592 - 01:12:53.044, Speaker B: Right.
01:12:53.162 - 01:12:53.732, Speaker C: Sorry.
01:12:53.866 - 01:12:55.140, Speaker E: Destined version.
01:13:00.920 - 01:13:02.920, Speaker B: Though. We always push to production.
01:13:04.460 - 01:13:14.090, Speaker C: I think these are the guys that wait, I was asking and you don't test we're fixing that.
01:13:15.760 - 01:13:17.390, Speaker E: Do you have, like, a whole detail?
01:13:19.200 - 01:13:25.596, Speaker B: Yes, but not we can, like, we can figure yeah, we have we have people here that can help us.
01:13:25.618 - 01:13:38.250, Speaker C: Yeah. Oh, you don't need to yeah. And they're they're very.
