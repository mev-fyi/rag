00:00:11.530 - 00:00:22.094, Speaker A: I always knew that Portugal was quite a powerhouse in crypto, and what I found that was pretty pleasant. Many of them were pop collectors, so I felt pretty welcome.
00:00:22.212 - 00:00:26.806, Speaker B: It's just so exciting to see so many people from across the world come here today.
00:00:26.908 - 00:00:43.180, Speaker C: We have many people from different countries here, people from different projects, different industries, verticals. And it's growing because Portugal wants to be a crypto haven for people to come here and attract professionals. So it's amazing to be here in this community.
00:00:45.390 - 00:01:00.800, Speaker D: And it is that plethora of perspective, that different kind of combination of cultural, of attitude, of perspective, that really makes our decentralized ecosystem something that is very, very special.
00:01:03.650 - 00:01:25.960, Speaker E: I'm really excited about people building consumer experiences in Web Three products where you don't necessarily have to be like a Web Three believer in order to want to use them, because they're just useful and a delight to you. So I think what I'm looking forward to the most is meeting the hackers behind the project. Not necessarily just like whatever they're working on, but also the people behind that.
00:01:28.010 - 00:01:39.526, Speaker F: One thing for sure is that we need to give people peace of mind using web free products. So with smart accounts, we will be able to have much more secure setups for users.
00:01:39.638 - 00:02:04.898, Speaker G: I think that, like I mentioned in my talk, one of the things that I was really focusing on is kind of bringing the UX that we have of Web Two along with the characteristics that people value in Web Three. The big problem that is still not quite solved yet is around wallet UX. So that's kind of, in my opinion, the final hurdle. And once we get there, I think that we're going to see a lot more applications that are, quote unquote, Web Three mass adopted, mainly because the user isn't even going to know. It's a web3 application.
00:02:04.984 - 00:02:19.850, Speaker H: You need to start small, you need to start focused. You're not going to solve everyone's problem with one application. And so picking one lane and doing it well and building something that's truly differentiated and useful, ultimately, at the end of the day, value ends up flowing.
00:02:22.350 - 00:02:24.586, Speaker I: I want to be amazed by the.
00:02:24.608 - 00:02:25.514, Speaker B: Creativity of these people.
00:02:25.552 - 00:02:40.618, Speaker I: I don't have any concrete idea at the moment, but it is such a powerful primitive to have a human on chain that there's so much doors that it opens like we started it so that we can build UBI. It's a requirement for that, but it unlocks so many doors.
00:02:40.714 - 00:02:58.100, Speaker A: I know where we are going. We are going into mass adoption. It's going to take a long time, but it does look like we are past the tipping point for not getting there. The chain reaction has started. It's not going too fast, but it doesn't look like it's going to stop. Mass adoption will happen.
