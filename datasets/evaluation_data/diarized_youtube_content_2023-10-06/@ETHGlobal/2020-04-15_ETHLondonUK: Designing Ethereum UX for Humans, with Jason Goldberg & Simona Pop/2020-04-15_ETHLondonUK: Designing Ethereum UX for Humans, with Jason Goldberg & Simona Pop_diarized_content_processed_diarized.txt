00:00:00.650 - 00:00:25.506, Speaker A: So my name is Jason and I run a company called Peppo. And I run a company called OST, which stands for open, Simple Token. Pepo is built on OST technology. And I'm going to walk through kind of who we are, why we built this, and then what you can learn from it. So in the back of the room, we have Simona Pop come to the front. Simona. Some of you might know Simona.
00:00:25.506 - 00:00:38.150, Speaker A: She's world famous. She is our chief engagement officer. She runs a lot of programs around blockchain for good causes, for onboarding new people to the crypto community. What else are you doing this weekend?
00:00:38.650 - 00:00:49.398, Speaker B: I am Mceeing. I don't know if you saw me. I was like a little bit on stage for a second. So I will return to that stage later on on Sunday.
00:00:49.574 - 00:01:13.166, Speaker A: But yeah, awesome. We'll see you around the so, also here from our team, we have so if you want to find me on Twitter, I'm betashop. Simona and simpop. We have Kevin. Kevin and Paul will be here all weekend and they are going to be judging the UX Awards. So they'll be kind of evaluating different projects. But so the UX awards.
00:01:13.166 - 00:01:45.280, Speaker A: So, as I mentioned, technology agnostic. There's 4000 die in prizes available in the UX Awards. The top team will win 2000 die. Two runner ups will win 1000 die. And so what I want to go through is what is great UX and how do you win a UX Award and why are we making this technology agnostic? So, as I mentioned, we are the makers of an app called Pepo. Pepo is built on ethereum. We spent four years building technology that enables apps like people to be possible.
00:01:45.280 - 00:02:19.590, Speaker A: We have an SDK that enables apps to basically integrate a Ethereum smart contract wallet seamlessly into any application. Now, unfortunately, it's not something that you can do in a weekend because you need to have an iOS or Android app. And they also have certain things they need to do in order to get those apps approved by the app stores. But we are working on enabling white label apps for future hackathons and other things to enable people to hack on those aspects of our technology. And we're also going to be opening up other aspects. The SDK is open source, but we'll be having other things hackers can do at these hackathons. But we want to show everyone what's possible.
00:02:19.590 - 00:02:42.366, Speaker A: When you think through kind of the user experience driving the technology and the two things coming together in tandem. I encourage everyone, though, to download the app on the App Store. The app is basically it's bringing together the crypto community. We launched it at DevCon a few months ago. A third of all DevCon participants in Osaka tried the app. They gave us tons of feedback. We then iterated on.
00:02:42.366 - 00:03:14.374, Speaker A: It during San Francisco Blockchain week during Singapore Blockchain week last year. Then in Waterloo ETH. Waterloo last year. And then we did a whole new relaunch of the app based on the user feedback, based on having an active conversation with hundreds of users, thousands of points of feedback. We did a relaunch in ETH Denver two weeks ago and the uses just skyrocketed from there. And what we learned through the feedback was what you see here is communities. So the People app features 32nd videos by people with integrated tokens appreciation.
00:03:14.374 - 00:03:37.346, Speaker A: So every like actually transfers value. And what we found was people were using the app and the Ethereum community very differently from TikTok. TikTok is like fun entertainment. People in Ethereum and crypto were using it more like professional and business and work and things, their passions. And they drove us to say, well, could we organize this into different communities? And so we launched Communities last week. Communities. Crypto's killer app.
00:03:37.346 - 00:04:31.490, Speaker A: I think we all know this, but we launched Communities last week. We have Communities for ETH Denver, for ETH London here this week for ETHC next week for 1 million developers. People are creating communities now on things like foodies, others type topics, but starting from the crypto community and building out. But I encourage you to download it not just really just to try it as like an app because obviously there's lots of video apps out there, but to experience the onboarding experience. What it's like to download an app, sign up and within 60 seconds have a smart contract deployed on your behalf. To be able to secure that smart contract with just a six digit Pin that you can recover from the smart contract, to be able to have multiple devices that you can connect into the smart contract assets, your funds. I'm going to walk you through some of these features, but I think it's really valuable if you're developing on Ethereum to see what's possible if you think through the user experience from smart contract wallet perspective.
00:04:31.490 - 00:05:14.638, Speaker A: And so our technology that we built, I don't want to make this a sales pitch, I just want to give you kind of what's behind this is basically what we've built is this Ethereum application layer. So kind of SDKs to enable you to embed smart contract Wallets into any app. And the key thing here is basically we're deploying a series of smart contracts for every single user inside the application. And so that enables the user experience that people provides. And so I wanted to kind of dispel this notion that UX is designed. I think often people hear about user experience, they hear about UX and they think, oh, that's the graphic design team, or that's the pixels. UX is not about design, design is a part of it.
00:05:14.638 - 00:06:00.410, Speaker A: But the reality is that UX is about problem solving. It's about really understanding what does the user need, what is their pain point and how do we build the right product for them. Similar myth is that UX is all about the interface that UX is all about. A lot of people talk about UX. They say it's just about the onboarding or just about how fast people can get through the app. The reality is that UX is about that unique combination of the story, the architecture, and the implementation. And really, if you think about how do you merge these worlds of, okay, this is the user story and this is what the user is trying to accomplish, and this is the technology, and how do we bend the technology or mold the technology to get the experience that we want? So the key to all of this is starting with the problem instead of with the solution.
00:06:00.410 - 00:06:43.178, Speaker A: And I think all too often in crypto, we sometimes start with the crypto is a very elegant solution for decentralizing finance or for banking, the unbanked, and therefore we're going to build this. But that's not solving a problem. That's kind of saying, well, do we have a solution in mind? Solving a problem is really thinking through, all right, there are these people and they have this pain point, and we've identified it, and so we're going to build this to help them do something easier, better, faster, cheaper, more convenient. And so just we'll give you a little perspective on this backing up. Four years ago when we started this project, the AHA that we had, we had like, well, everyone is increasingly a content creator. Imagine this is 2016. Not even TikTok doesn't even exist yet.
00:06:43.178 - 00:07:35.486, Speaker A: We're looking out the world and saying, everyone is a content creator. And every single day we're contributing our content to the platforms and they get all of our content for free. And they monetize their platforms to build these huge businesses facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, et cetera. And the problem is, if you're an Instagram influencer, how do you earn more than just likes? If you're a top influencer when I say one of the kardashians, yes, you can. But how do any of us just we're giving away so much content every day. How do we earn more than just likes? And the AHA we had was, well, what if every like could actually transfer value? What if you actually could inject the Internet of money into applications and have peer to peer value transfers with every like? And it doesn't be the like. It could be the five star review, it could be the upvote, whatever it might be.
00:07:35.486 - 00:08:11.340, Speaker A: What if that would be possible? So imagine we're thinking about this in 2016. Well, we then went right to thinking about what would that user experience have to be? And we're like, well, it can't be this. If you can't read this in the back, basically what this is, you go to say like someone's Instagram photo and it says, please write down twelve words to set up your wallet before proceeding. Instagram users are not going to write down twelve words. We as early adopters of Ethereum and crypto. We will because we're willing to suffer through some pain to try to build something. But that's not what mainstream users are going to do.
00:08:11.340 - 00:09:03.018, Speaker A: How do we solve that problem that the user doesn't have to go through this clumsy experience or let's say using an external wallet, right? Or let's say because to proceed, let's say connect MetaMask. I don't mean to pick on MetaMask. It's a great product and great team, but it's like, users are not going to say, I'm going to take a lesser experience than I know of today in Instagram just to earn a few cents before I even know what this is. So you can't expect users exit this app and go into another app in order to proceed. But let's just imagine for a second that our users were willing to do that and I successfully click the like button and magically, let's say that we figured out a way to have money transferring from one user to the other user. Well, users aren't going to they're not going to put up with this where it's like, okay, well, please open up some other app to confirm the transaction or sign the transaction. Make sure you have some ETH in your wallet in order to do so.
00:09:03.018 - 00:09:35.074, Speaker A: What's ETH? Right? That's not going to, you know, obviously an Instagram user is used know, amazingly, super fast, responsive application. They're not going to put up with, please wait for the block confirmations in order for this transaction to be approved. And then especially this couldn't be the experience. And basically, if you can't read this, what it says is please spend 2.9 cents to send your one cent to Ben. Right? And so you think about what Ethereum layer one gas costs. It can be more than this.
00:09:35.074 - 00:10:30.374, Speaker A: It can be somewhat less. But this is pretty typical, right? And so back in 2016, I hooked up with my good friend Ben, who was really early, early in Ethereum. He was lead developer of Hyperledger Burrow. He worked at Monacs and made Safe and was thinking about these problems for a long time before I was so I was coming from the web two o world, thinking about user experience. How do we enable Instagram users to earn more than likes? And I started talking to Ben about, well, how would we go about solving this and that's, like, that marriage of like, what do you want the experience to be and what technology do you need to build in order to make that happen? And I just fell right down the rabbit hole. I think, as we all do, when you think about, okay, the elegance of the possibilities of this technology and how might we solve this and think, okay, yes, so one person could have, let's say we had, let's say, the Internet of information. Now we have the Internet of people go to the Internet of money.
00:10:30.374 - 00:11:29.894, Speaker A: And with any transaction that could be transferring value, person to person without going through the platforms and everyone's controlling their own funds and like, wow, how could we make this happen? So UX driven thinking is you then turn that into thinking like a solution. And so what we thought through back in 2017 was, what if we could deploy the app tokens, let's say the Instagram Tokens, or in our case, the People Tokens and the app that we've built here, what if we could deploy the app Tokens on layer two Ethereum, so it's faster and cheaper. So that solves some of the problems in terms of speed, in terms of cost, but do so with a full EVM running on layer two. So that gives us the smart contract capabilities and then use the smart contract capabilities to do things such as enabling user friendly recovery. So as you'll see in the People app, you can recover a wallet with a six digit Pin, and yet it's safe and secure because it's the way it's designed through the smart contracts to enable something called Session keys. So session keys. Really awesome stuff.
00:11:29.894 - 00:12:07.554, Speaker A: Basically, for every user in the People app, we deploy a multi SIG. They have a private key on their device. A user has full self custody. Their private key on the device interacts with the multi SIG basically to access the funds in their token holder address. And that multisig also authorizes session keys. And the session keys basically allow to execute small transactions on the user's behalf. So let's say within a one week period, up to $10 every like that I do, I don't need to sign the transaction and metatransactions are employed, so the users doesn't need to worry about gas, right? And so that's how you kind of think through it.
00:12:07.554 - 00:12:42.270, Speaker A: How do you enable these experiences? But also think about UX is also about how do you pull all the technology together? So I just want to show you real quick the result of this. I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to do a live demo, but I think I can. Let's see. And the live demo I want to show you is less again, about people being a really cool social app, but more about how do you enable the Internet of money to be integrated into any application? So this is Pipo here at ETH London. You'll see there's people who creating videos. That's me. Cool SIM.
00:12:42.270 - 00:13:40.112, Speaker A: Thank you. So now the cool stuff when it comes to us technology geeks here is every time I tap the like button here, think about it's, like medium claps, except I'm actually sending the other person money. Every one of these claps that I'm doing here or these Likes is worth one cent. And so if I go out to the blockchain here, you'll see that I sent a few seconds ago, 24 PPOs to that person, and the cost of that transaction was zero 00:11 cents on our layer two chain because it's not a competitive environment like proof of work. It's a collaborative environment. On layer two, on the chains we've set up. And so what you have is super fast transactions.
00:13:40.112 - 00:14:19.010, Speaker A: You have users having a full Ethereum wallet inside the application. So this is the smart contract. So the token holder address or where my funds are held so I can set up multiple devices to access the funds, I have a recovery address to basically initiate recovery from the smart contract with a delayed recovery. Now, again, we don't expect anyone here to build this in a weekend, right? But we have an SDK for this. And if you're interested, after the hackathon, if you want to build an app on this, we're happy to help you do this and help you think it through. But we wanted to show this as an example of how do you marry kind of design thinking and technology thinking into creating great user experiences. So back to the presentation here.
00:14:19.010 - 00:14:56.330, Speaker A: Did someone have a question? I thought I saw someone. Okay, all right, so I can so basically we had to build all this and continue building it in order to enable an app like that. And then we want to make this not just one app, but make any app to be able to do it. We can talk through some of the components later if you want to come by and find me. But also it's important we deploy a Gnosis multi SIG for every single user. And if you're doing that on layer one, that'd be super expensive. In layer two, it's a lot cheaper.
00:14:56.330 - 00:15:55.260, Speaker A: And we had to build basically a relayer and also ability to kind of have tokens. On layer one, Ethereum we call value tokens, that has basically a connection to layer two, which are the utility tokens or the app tokens. And then to be able to anchor this all back in layer one in order to make it actually fully on blockchain. So a lot of hard problems to solve to make these user experiences possible. So I'm going to go past this because I showed this on the live demo. So as you think through, how do you create kind of great user experiences? In crypto, what I wanted to share is what we call the five UX essentials and kind of think about them as kind of starters, kind of guidelines to think about how do you marry the worlds of UX and technology towards building things that people actually need. So the first principle I say is like, you really need to have a use case.
00:15:55.260 - 00:16:39.434, Speaker A: Don't just build technology for technology's sake. Think about why are you building what you're building and who you're building it for. As I said before, the framework that I like to use, I call it yes. But so and how and to give you kind of how this works, it's like you kind of just write this down in a sentence and you say yes, there are these people, let's say yes, there's these developers who need something. They need to be able to code something in a weekend that it normally takes them two weeks to do, right? But there's this problem that stops them from doing it that technology is too hard for them to work with or there's this thing they can't get their head around so they're stuck, right? And a lot of what we do is we build things to help people who are stuck get unstuck. And so we built this in order to help them get unstuck or help them solve what the problem they want to solve. And here's how it works.
00:16:39.434 - 00:17:43.614, Speaker A: So you can apply this yes, but so framework to pretty much any problem that you might build a product around. So to go back to the example that I showed you, with people it was like, yes, everyone is a creator, but the large platforms are making all the money. And with everyone being a creator, it's harder and harder for creators to stand out, get noticed and to connect with people that share their passions. And so we built Peepo, which is an authentic, community driven social platform, to solve this problem. And how do we do it? Well, we combine 32nd videos every like earning money, tokens using to help the signal noise problems. Now, you notice I didn't mention the word blockchain crypto, Ethereum once here because even though this is the how like it's part of this, every like earns a token and tokens are used to kind of help solve this signal noise problem. The fact that it's built on Ethereum or built in crypto or blockchain is an enabler of that, right? And it's the ingredients that made these experiences possible.
00:17:43.614 - 00:18:26.266, Speaker A: But that's not what solves the fact that we build on Ethereum doesn't solve the user's problem to the user. What solves the user's problem is that they want to get something done faster or better or more convenient or whatever the problem you might be solving. So how do you go about doing that? So the key from our perspective is really understanding user motivations. Another thing about is know the pain point, right? You need to really understand what is the hot button that's going to get users to switch to your product. And the way I like to put it is that no matter what you're building, your target user is switching from something. And it could be that they're switching from not knowing they even have a problem or not knowing that, or maybe switching from complacency. Or it could be switching from the web two world to the web three world.
00:18:26.266 - 00:19:04.610, Speaker A: But everyone switches from something. They're doing something today that occupies their time and they need to give a little bit of their time to you. Whereas the thing about like, say in the App Store, there's a billion apps and most people use only seven to ten apps on their phone. If you want to become one of those seven to ten, likely something else drops out of someone's day. And so you have to think, how do you occupy the space in someone's life that was occupied by something else before? So if you're building a developer tool, for instance, there's lots of tools that developers can use to do lots of things and they have to think, okay, I'm going to use this one. I'm going to dig to it and stop using something else. Most likely because most people don't just keep layering, layering, layering, adding tools.
00:19:04.610 - 00:19:46.854, Speaker A: At some point something falls out. And so you think about, let's say if you use GitHub today, you use something else before. If you use Jira today or Notion, you use something else before, there's always something that drops when something else is kind of adopted. So the way to kind of figure this out, and I know you don't have time to do this necessarily in a hackathon weekend, although you have a couple of hundred other hackers you can talk to is really to talk to people. And talk to people means listen to them and find out what their needs are and try to find something that people actually need. And this I really implore you to try to build something, whether it's here this weekend or just in general when you go back home, work on your products or your jobs. Try to build stuff that people need.
00:19:46.854 - 00:20:25.422, Speaker A: And the way you know people need it is that they tell you they need it. It's not just our hunch or hypothesis that they need it. It's actually hearing from them that they need it. They have a pain point. And I'll say real quick, as someone who's been an old guy who's been working in building products as a product manager for 25 years now, there was a time, I think about 15 years ago, where I think if you were just really smart, you could build something without talking to users. I felt like it was basically before the App Store, before a billion apps and anyone could build an app in a week that you basically just put up a website. And if you were a first mover, you could build something and find a niche.
00:20:25.422 - 00:20:54.906, Speaker A: I mean, I had a company, social media that we had 6 million users within three months. You can't do that anymore. It just doesn't happen anymore. There's too much competition. But now hunches alone are not enough today. Now you have to talk to users, have to talk to who might be the customers of your app before you build something. If you want to go deep and kind of learn a little bit about this, we have basically these three principles for kind of how you talk to users, how you do conduct user interviews and make the information usable, we call them.
00:20:54.906 - 00:21:26.440, Speaker A: Basically you build a foundation. You get participation from everyone on your team. And then you go through a prioritization exercise and just really quickly, the foundation is basically understanding the difference between discovery and kind of hypothesis experimenting or hypothesis testing and then turning that into something that actually is actionable. So discovery is basically when you're talking to people and hearing what they say. And then you then build hypotheses around that and put experiments in front of people. And then you do hypotheses and tests and having kind of a framework to kind of go step by step to test. This is super important.
00:21:26.440 - 00:22:02.026, Speaker A: Participation is just a lot of people, as I said at the beginning, they think, UX, they go, that's the design team or that's the product team at our company. I implore you in your project as well. Everyone does interviews. Everyone listens, participates in interviews. We kind of say that understanding and hearing the needs of the customer is everyone's job. And especially because what I found in my career is that depending on your background and what your job function is, everyone hears differently. An engineer will hear the same conversation as a product manager, as a UX designer, as a CFO, as a business development person.
00:22:02.026 - 00:22:38.800, Speaker A: They'll hear the same exact conversation differently and they'll all bring in very important input into it. So having the whole team participate in user research is really, really important. And then ultimately, obviously, you got to turn that into prioritization, which is in some ways one of the hardest parts because you got to distill all this information and learning that you have from doing user research and interviews. And kind of say what are the themes and which are the ones that we think are actually actionable and turn that into a roadmap. And one way we do that is we tag things. And so we use tools like Dovetail, for instance, to tag things. And then we kind of go into kind of diving into what are the most common themes that we heard.
00:22:38.800 - 00:22:42.282, Speaker A: So do you want to do it, Simona?
00:22:42.346 - 00:22:43.280, Speaker B: Up to you.
00:22:43.810 - 00:22:47.594, Speaker A: Up to you. Let's do it.
00:22:47.652 - 00:22:48.162, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:22:48.216 - 00:22:48.914, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:49.112 - 00:22:49.742, Speaker B: Oh, shit.
00:22:49.806 - 00:22:50.670, Speaker A: The third principle.
00:22:50.750 - 00:22:51.380, Speaker B: Hello.
00:22:52.150 - 00:22:53.006, Speaker A: There's no microphone.
00:22:53.038 - 00:24:05.210, Speaker B: It's actually just no, I know. So, empowerment. Does the solution expand the market further? Overall adoption and onboard new users. As you guys know, if some of you have seen this morning in the beginner workshop, it is all about how do you get more people in to that application? How do you essentially solve a problem for more people, not just the people who are literally with you here now? Because this has been one of the issues, for instance, that we've seen at Hackathons, people develop either for themselves or to do a fun weekend project or show off to their peers. Let's start getting into this mindset of building for a problem to solve something for actual people. And I think that's a big, big takeaway that I'm hoping I'm going to see throughout 2020, across all the hackathons, across all of the UX awards that we're going to do at the ETH Global hackathons, is how do we get all of these towards frictionless onboarding. Let's think about new ways.
00:24:05.210 - 00:24:11.930, Speaker B: Rather than getting people to download a web three wallet, then move here, then do this like Jason showed you earlier.
00:24:13.310 - 00:25:04.086, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm going to call you back in a second. So one of the cool things actually being in this space for several years is actually seeing how this has evolved with every year and every progressive hackathon. And I think Aspona was saying that 2020 is the year where we think about two years ago the experience was very, very limited and very, very dev focused. And then especially in the last twelve months, we've seen a big acceleration in things like onboarding experience and things like interactions, things like Smart Contract Wallets 2020 to be a big year for kind of how we pull this together. And so when it comes to evaluating hackathon projects in 2020, there are certain expectations now that we're not going to have users go through super clumsy onboarding experiences, super clumsy interaction experiences, that some of this stuff just is going to get progressively better and better and better. And then there is this notion of the bottom here, surprising delight.
00:25:04.086 - 00:25:48.174, Speaker A: And I would say that one of the best things, and I know this seems very hard from where we're at as developing projects, but one of the best things that someone can tell us is, wait, this is really crypto. And when you hear that, it's like, okay, now we've gotten to them where they're not thinking about the crypto, they're thinking about the actual application or what they're trying to get done. And the crypto is that enabler that we talked about. So the fourth is innovation. I think this goes without saying that great. UX also introduces technology that helps us leap past kind of the current state, hopefully kind of presents a step function, kind of something that kind of accelerates. It could be accelerating, making something more convenient or easier.
00:25:48.174 - 00:26:30.486, Speaker A: Let's say you take something that used to take a developer two weeks to do, and you make it two lines of code and you had an hour, right? That's a huge innovation and that's a huge impact on user experience. Fifth and last, responsibility. So especially in the crypto community, we think responsibility is a critical part of UX. Three things here, I'll just go through it. First of all, does the solution that you're developing contribute to the common good? And you might think, well, I'm not building a project for charity, or I'm not building something that is, let's say, directly bring the economy good, where it's for good causes, but just building something and put it out there into the world has a huge impact if you do it the right way. And what I mean by that is if you basically show. Others how they can use it.
00:26:30.486 - 00:27:09.910, Speaker A: So you provide developer tools for other people to be able to adopt your solution and then hopefully open source as much of the technology as possible so that anyone can just take your technology, build on it. Now, open source is something where just open sourcing something FYI does not mean people are going to use it. So creating some developer tools on top of it is really helpful so then developers don't have to build it all from scratch. So one of the things I've heard progressively at various hackathons is we still have this problem of, yes, there's a protocol here, a thing here, thing here, thing here, but I have to cobble all that together in my unique way. What I need is some more like just stuff. I can just start with the foundation and then just build from there. And that's really cool if people can start building more and more things like that.
00:27:09.910 - 00:27:54.498, Speaker A: That so, as I said, five UX essentials that you're thinking about your product, think about your hackathon, think about kind of the UX Awards. Make sure you have a use case, make sure you show a keen understanding of user needs. Think about how are you empowering users with new onboarding and other ways to make the experience better. How are you introducing a new technology to innovate and make things more convenient and easier? And then how are you showing responsibility towards the common good in what you're developing? So let's wrap up. We have 80 of these hoodies, limited edition. We made some for ETH Denver a couple of weeks ago and they went super fast. The only way to get these hoodies is to earn 2000 people coins in the people app.
00:27:54.498 - 00:28:20.490, Speaker A: When you earn your 2000 people coins, where's Paul? Paul. You go to Paul and you can basically buy using the app. You can buy the hoodie with your people coins. Now, you don't need to make a million videos in order to earn 2000 people coins. This weekend we have six challenges that you go to the people table. Paul and Kevin will show you the challenges. Very simple.
00:28:20.490 - 00:28:37.462, Speaker A: Do like a Hellwell World video. Do a video with you. Kind of a social. So like introducing someone for the first time that you meet here. There's one challenge, specifically around 1 million devs. So what's your idea for how do we onboard more developers? For Ethereum? You do three or four of the challenges. You can buy a hoodie.
00:28:37.462 - 00:29:04.774, Speaker A: The hoodies are cool. They have this little Ethereum insignia on them. So they're a real collector's item. Awesome. And then just remind you UX Awards 4000 die in prizes 2000 for the best UX 1000 for each of the runner ups at Eat Denver. Two weeks ago, 27 of the 75 teams applied for the UX Awards. So we encourage you, if you are submitting for UX Awards, submit early.
00:29:04.774 - 00:29:19.980, Speaker A: Get a hold of our team there'll be a type form you'll need to fill out. It's very simple. We want to make sure you get time with our team so that our team knows to spend time with you. You'll have seven minutes max to present your project to our team.
