00:29:00.220 - 00:31:10.644, Speaker B: Empathic one, two, three. Everybody, we're gonna get started. Please, please take your seats. We'll give everybody two minutes. And in the meantime, let's get ready for the closing ceremonies. Is everybody ready? That wasn't loud enough? Is everybody ready? All right, let's get this going. Welcome to eat.
00:31:10.644 - 00:32:40.700, Speaker B: New York Closing Ceremonies We're going to kick this off with a blast. Welcome all of you to eat New York. The vibe is electric. It's alive, highly caffeinated. I don't imagine myself being anywhere else. Now that I messed up full screen, let's start all over. I am Kartik, one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I am super excited to welcome all of you to the final day of ETH New York.
00:32:40.700 - 00:33:24.932, Speaker B: We spent the last few hours going through hundreds of projects and talking to amazing people, and we're going to showcase what came out of all of this. So first of all, welcome to all of you joining us from the live stream. I already see a couple hundred people on YouTube, so you're going to also get to see all the project demos on eGlobal TV. And also, you'll be one of the people receiving PO apps, so please sign in if you end up watching this in the next hour. So this event has been the biggest we've ever done. 1500 attendees from 56 different countries, and 37% of them were new to Web three. I am so happy to see that no matter what the market's doing, no matter what else is going on here, the development excitement is not stopping.
00:33:24.932 - 00:34:14.728, Speaker B: And after that, we saw 251 submissions this morning that is absolutely incredible. And this makes it our biggest event ever. So congratulations to 251 teams here that really pulled through and submitted a project. And I can't wait to show you some of our favorites today. And a big thank you to all the judges that spent all of this morning talking to all these teams, giving amazing feedback, talking about what they can do next. And I want to give a big shout out to all of them.

All right, this brings us to why we are here for the next hour, this is not a conference. This whole weekend was about building interesting and amazing things.
00:35:06.296 - 00:35:44.624, Speaker B: And the goal was to make sure we focus on showcasing and not telling. So after these 251 submissions, we calculated all the scores and we found ten finalists. This is a typo off to a great start. And without further ado, I'd like to welcome these ten well, this is also nine teams because I did not full screen before these ten teams. And please congratulate big a big round of applause to Gittle burn My Wallet. Suzuki NFT safe launch pearl Steam, Tokenizer, Reverb, mesh Link and safe node. And Nfdos, there will be ten teams coming on stage.
00:35:44.624 - 00:36:16.028, Speaker B: These are some of our ten amazing projects that are going to live demo what they built over this weekend. And you'll get to see all of them on stage. And after the 10th demo, we will talk about all the prizes everybody has won from all of our amazing sponsors. And before we go into our very first demo, I want to give a big shout out to the 241 teams that are listed here. Just because you were not on that ten list does not mean you were not good enough. There was amazing work that we saw from so many of you. And I really hope that you continue building and taking this project from here on to the next stage.
00:36:16.028 - 00:36:44.680, Speaker B: So thank you so much to everybody that shipped something, and this is something to be absolutely proud of. Congratulations. And to those of you who want to find out what all the projects are. You can head over to Ethgobal.com Showcase to see all 250 plus projects. You can see all of them right now and learn more about what everybody else is excited about. So without further ado, let's welcome our very first finalist demo for the day and that is Project Biddle Gittle.
00:36:51.130 - 00:38:00.574, Speaker A: Hello. We are proud to present Gitle, a tool that unlocks the potential of asset sharing among guilds. So essentially what we are is a guild manager management platform that allows members to share gaming accounts to increase fellowship and collaboration within their guild. So how come we worked on this? We worked on this because right now gaming development has had a lot of development so far and there's more to come with the rise of blockchain technologies, there's new use cases and new possibilities when it comes like and this includes formation of gaming asset, formation of gaming assets, and guilds. Sorry, I'm a little nervous. And to meet the need, we created Gittle. So how do we do this? So the Gitl protocol allows for users to create guilds to aid each other and to share each other's gaming accounts.
00:38:00.574 - 00:38:30.970, Speaker A: And we do this using the soul bound token mechanism and this allows for community interaction and maintains trust. So here we will present one of the major use cases for Gittle, which is for you as a guild member, you'll be able to use another member's account and then play as that member and then accelerate the skill levels of that member and then vice versa. They can do that for your accounts as well and then overall level up the entire guild.
00:38:32.590 - 00:38:56.146, Speaker B: Thanks. Let's go to the demo right now. So I'm adding to the giddle interface. It's already connected either way with MetaMask. So this is basically your landing page. This is a guild that you are already in. So you can see the number of games, the number of NFT inside, and also some other things, for example, the number of people.
00:38:56.146 - 00:39:15.906, Speaker B: So if you want to create a new guild, it's like pretty easily you can do many things. You can upload picture, add a new name, et cetera. This is on EPFS. But the most important thing is that you want to be invited to a game. That's how it works usually. So let's check. This is an invite that you received.
00:39:15.906 - 00:40:01.094, Speaker B: So you got all the info, you can either way accept it or not, but usually you accept it because you know the person that is inviting you. So I will simply accept and by accepting this invitation I will mint on polygon a solbon token that basically said that I'm a member of the team and that I'm able to share either way my assets or that I can use other guild members assets. So yeah, we should be able to see it live if it's going through. Yeah, exactly. So this is a Salvan token. So anyway, so let's go back to the team, and let's say in this case, I want to help my friends. It's new in the game, and we want to speed the thing up.
00:40:01.094 - 00:41:00.218, Speaker B: So I will use his account because I'm an experienced user of this game, and that way we can level up, as I said, pretty fast. So I will simply add him to the team, and that way we should be able to see his NFT arrived. This is one that you can share with the team. And if I want to use it, I will simply click on play and yes. So from a technical standpoint, what is actually happening is that Joseph, as fellow guild members, he can request access to Magnosisafe, and Magnosisafe is actually my player account inside the snoop game. So by scanning the QR code and using the Nosisafe web application, he will be then able to log in to the Snook game. Actually, just if he was me inside the game.
00:41:00.218 - 00:41:20.578, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's try real quick. So this is a game. This is on polygon. I will simply connect with my wallet account. So remember, this is not my NFT, but I'm still able to use it because Nicholas gave me the right to use it. So I'm not able to do things that he doesn't want me to do, but I'm still able to play the game.
00:41:20.578 - 00:41:40.814, Speaker B: So this is the demo. Yeah. Amazing. Congrats. Please give them a big round of applause. Even I get nervous on stage. It's okay.
00:41:40.814 - 00:41:54.570, Speaker B: We want to thank you all, the juries and the team. Thank you very much. All right, next up, we have Burn My Wallet. And on deck, Tsukiji. Please give a big round of applause to Burn My Wallet.
00:42:29.250 - 00:42:57.170, Speaker A: New York. Hello, New York. We're burned my wallet. Sorry. So we're trying to solve the problem of your stolen passphrase. Your wallet is done. It's been hacked, and we're solving it with soul bound tokens.
00:42:57.170 - 00:43:15.100, Speaker A: So your stolen wallet with soul bound tokens, your soul is burning in hell. Get it? Okay, so you can actually see this live on burnmywallet.com. And who are we? I'm Erin. I worked on the front end, and Nikita worked on the back end.
00:43:15.870 - 00:43:54.358, Speaker B: Yeah. So once your wallet is stolen, the hacker can't actually lock you out. So this gives you an opportunity to pull a kill switch on your wallet. We do this by minting a sole bound or non transferable token that you can only mint to your own wallet so somebody else can't burn your account. And once it's in your account, the hacker can't do anything to remove it. So this is a signal to other apps that your wallet has been burned or has been hacked. So other wallet apps can prevent transactions from growing into your account.
00:43:54.358 - 00:44:41.190, Speaker B: Dows can disable voting rights by looking, checking if you have this token in your account and preventing you from voting. And social protocols can show that you've been hacked and make sure that the hacker isn't phishing any of your friends. So how it works, you basically go to Burnmywallet.com, you can mint it on Mumbai or Rinkbe. And, yeah, it's basically a modified ERC 721 with some improvements made into it. And the goal really is to integrate with all these apps as easily as possible. So we give you an API where all you do is you need to put the chain and the address, and we tell you if this wallet has been hacked.
00:44:41.190 - 00:45:19.342, Speaker B: So to actually basically burn your wallet, you go to our site. You can switch to Ethereum or Rinkbe and basically burn it. This puts the token into your address. So once you've actually got the token, your address, you can easily check if any account has been burned. So if we go over here, we can check that this wallet address has been burned and basically you've been hacked. You can actually check this on different networks as well on polygon. And you can see that on this chain, it hasn't been hacked right now.
00:45:19.342 - 00:45:52.810, Speaker B: And you can see a list of all the hacked wallets. So this is just a front end to kind of easily use yourself. But this connects to a public API that any app can integrate into. And so that's where we integrated with did an example integration with Xmtp. So in this case, we took the existing Xmtp client, where you're just messaging other people on chain, and you can basically now see that it checks. If you have this wallet sorry. If you have this token in your account, it puts a big red hacked next to your name.
00:45:52.810 - 00:46:28.600, Speaker B: So now you're not getting phished anymore when you're receiving messages, thinking that it's from one of your friends. We also have a public subgraph, so anybody can query additional data, like when wallets have been hacked and other information. And really, the goal is to make this super easy to integrate with a couple of lines of code. You can add security against hacked accounts into any of your DApps. And yeah, so try it out. You can try it out right now, Burnmywallet.com, and talk to us if you're making a DAP, because we'd love to integrate with you.
00:46:28.600 - 00:47:09.010, Speaker B: Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations to burn my wallet. Next up we have SUKIJI, and on deck we'll get NFT Safe launch. Please welcome SUKIJI on stage. All right, good afternoon. Today we're here to introduce SUKIJI, a next generation NFT exchange, proudly built on top opensea's newly released seaport protocol to rethink the way that we trade non fungible tokens.
00:47:09.010 - 00:47:40.910, Speaker B: Now, why the name Tsukiji built on seaport? We wanted to imagine a bustling seaside port where people are there trading commercing. And specifically, we wanted to recreate our platform and experience of thinking about a local fish market where locals are there bartering their goods. So as an homage to what was once the world's largest fish market, the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo, Japan, we named our project after them, built on the Seaport Protocol.
00:47:42.610 - 00:48:32.400, Speaker A: So what is it that we actually built? We built a platform for people to have platform people to mint and to exchange NFTs in a batched way and barter the NFTs. We also created on top of a UI, also a dedicated API to enable a new ecosystem of fulfillers. So this is extensible to a lot of different use cases. Like. In addition to having the UI for consumers to buy and sell their NFTs, we also have an API that exposes all of the open orders and considerations so that people are able to use this data to create even. More use cases like use arbitrage opportunities, or potentially even built an entire platform of matching algorithms and different use cases with the exposed data. We spent a lot of time building a sleek and user focused experience this weekend, and JM is going to share more about that right now in our live demo.
00:48:34.370 - 00:48:58.066, Speaker B: I receive your tokens, you receive mine. Enough talking. Let's go to a live demo. All right, imagine I'm Bob the Builder, and I own some crypto punks. If I go over to the Tsukiji platform, I will see recommendations based on my owned tokens. So let's say Bob the Builder also owns a ton of Azukis. Then we'll be able to see a bunch of listings regarding Azukis.
00:48:58.066 - 00:49:26.318, Speaker B: On the flip side of the story, we have Alice the Ape, who owns a bunch of macs and baycs. One day, Alice really wants to purchase a crypto punk. So they go on to Zukiji and create an offer. Let's say, what's a competitive offer? Five mutant apes, maybe two board apes, and let's whip in like an ETH there and create an offer. On the flip side, we go out to the real market and look for what we want. And Alice wanted an alien puck specifically. So we're going to update our order like that.
00:49:26.318 - 00:50:02.486, Speaker B: When we confirm the listing, we're going to see a pop up to sign a message just to verify that we are indeed the true holders of these tokens. Once that's created, we're going to look at our console to quickly realize our data has been successfully saved on our file storage. So flip side, we go back to Bob. Now. Bob is fishing out on the market, refreshes his screen, and realizes that there is a new offer on the market for an alien punk, and he's indeed down to explore the market and give out his punk. So he goes to the listing and looks through. What is the exchange I'm allowed to go through? Well, I'm going to trade all these MYCs and give out my punk.
00:50:02.486 - 00:50:24.090, Speaker B: I'm down for that. So we fulfill the purchase, and that's sort of how SUKIJI works. We're going to allow people to batch exchange various groups of tokens. All right. Thanks, JM. All right. There's one thing that really, really excited about here, and that's specifically the filman API.
00:50:24.090 - 00:50:59.560, Speaker B: So as you can imagine, we have transactions on a blockchain. This analogy that you guys might be familiar with, transactions initiated, it's broadcasted, it's mined, it's added to the blockchain, the transaction is complete. There's a very appropriate analogy here where with Tsukiji, an order is initiated. That order is broadcast to fulfillers. Fulfillers do their job, they do their thing, they get a reward through tips on these orders. That order is settled through Seaport. And what we have here is a self driven economy of users and fulfillers creating this flywheel effect.
00:50:59.560 - 00:51:19.850, Speaker B: Ultimately, that's tsukiji. We can't wait to see what you guys do with Tsukiji and Seaport. Thank you for your time. That was incredible. Being able to see that immediately on a weekend is mind blowing. So with that, please give them a big round of applause. And next up, we have NFT Safe launch.
00:51:19.850 - 00:52:33.250, Speaker B: Hi guys. Quick show of hands. Who minted NFT? Who got rug pulled? So we aim to solve this by adding an extension to the ERC 721 contract where projects can create more trust before the Minting process begins. So right now we seen a plenty of projects who executed on roadmap flawlessly and holders received a lot of value, but yet we saw a lot of rug pools. Our solution is basically bringing the roadmap on chain where when you create a contract, you can add different steps that needs to be completed before the funds are accessed. Because right now when a project mints out, the creators get access to the funds immediately and sometimes they just run away with it. And because of this, new Minters don't have that much trust and they don't want to start a new don't want to ape into new projects.
00:52:33.250 - 00:52:36.420, Speaker B: So yeah.
00:52:39.030 - 00:52:41.140, Speaker C: You can see our NFT project.
00:52:41.590 - 00:52:44.866, Speaker B: We were also like four people, but they have to leave to the airport.
00:52:44.898 - 00:53:22.082, Speaker C: So we have a demo here with four predefined conditions. The condition should return a boolean. And these are just some examples that we came up with in our roadmap. We've included sending to a charity, sending over a board Ape and tossing a governance vote. When the condition is met, the NFT contract owner can mark that step as completed. So here you can see half of the supply is minted, the board Ape has been sent and we've donated to a charity. So if the team is unable to complete the roadmap, they can abandon the NFT project.
00:53:22.082 - 00:54:17.006, Speaker C: They're still allowed part of the treasury, but the NFT holders will be able to withdraw your remaining balance. As the last step, we've included a governance proposal for the project and all the holders to vote if the project should move on. Utilizing Uma's optimistic oracle, we can get the answer to any question. In this case, specifically a snapshot vote. Since we are in testnet, we need to validate this ourselves. We posted the question and now we're receiving the answer with the passing vote, we can now finalize the last step, a nice way of integrating off chain data for on chain validation. Now, the NFT product has a committed community that has been part of the governance and an executed roadmap on chain.
00:54:17.006 - 00:54:35.030, Speaker C: So now, of course, they can access the full treasury. To move ahead, we see projects being innovative with creating conditions, with the possibility of onchain and off chain data, making the Minting process safer and trustless.
00:54:37.710 - 00:55:05.614, Speaker B: And also, you don't have to do this complicated process all over. You can also just add one step like Minting complete. And whenever the Minting is complete, you can get access to funds. And if not, you can abandon the projects and the Minters can receive parts of their money back. That's our solution. Hopefully a lot of projects are starting to use it. Congratulations.
00:55:05.614 - 00:55:43.290, Speaker B: Next up, we have Pearl and on deck, Steam tokenizer. Please give Pearl a big round of applause. Where's that with you? It where's the audio? This audio is good. They just wait till they put it on screen. Yeah, got it. Eleanor, do you want to introduce while they pick it up? That's who.
00:55:50.500 - 00:56:29.308, Speaker A: It. Yeah. Who of you guys has been bombarded with telegram and discord announcements this week? Yes, exactly. Most of us in Web Three are completely overwhelmed with the task of staying up to date with the information that our communities put out there. We mute the servers and as a result, we miss out on important updates. But don't you worry anymore. That's why we've built Perl to solve this.
00:56:29.308 - 00:56:32.492, Speaker A: I'm going to hand it over to the team to show you how this works.
00:56:32.546 - 00:57:01.610, Speaker B: Exactly. All right, everyone, I'm Carlos. I am the founder of the Bullish Bears. NFT. Yeah, we host the sickest stealth parties in New York City. Woo. All right, time to leak some Alpha.
00:57:01.610 - 00:57:37.010, Speaker B: Okay, alpha is sent. All right. Actually you can see the notification from Bullish Bears arriving on my phone. We can go to the app here's. All the NFTs I'm associated with connected to my wallet. I can go to Bullish Bears and actually we'll keep the events, but I'm going to turn off allow list for now. I'll go back, I can continue.
00:57:37.010 - 00:57:40.210, Speaker B: And there it is. I can see the notification right there.
00:57:45.880 - 00:58:32.456, Speaker A: So what's powering this wallet to wallet communication? It's a new protocol we designed called Yamp, yet another message protocol. We believe it's important for any Web Three communication to be open and private. Open, meaning that any server or client may join the network. And also private, meaning that messages are not in public view, and that you specify what server is responsible for processing your messages. Looking at both Web Two and Web Three communication systems, we found that email, which has been around for more than 30 years, has both of these properties. So we decided to modify SMTP. SMTP looks up recipient addresses using DNS MX records, and instead we're using smart contracts to look up recipient wallet addresses.
00:58:32.456 - 00:58:36.980, Speaker A: Nestor will talk more about how our smart contracts are implemented.
00:58:38.680 - 00:59:23.030, Speaker B: Yeah, and basically the smart contract keeps just a mapping between the pull, the key of the owner of that NFT collection like Burs with the SMTP IP address. And also we have all the functions in order to verify, to sign and verify the messages that are going to be sent between the client and the server. This is our team. And now relaxer.
00:59:25.730 - 00:59:41.700, Speaker A: Guys. Well, this was a hackathon project for now. We're actually building this in real life as well. So if you thought this was interesting, if you're an NFT project trying to reach your users, if you're a user who's currently overwhelmed, or if you want to give us some money, come and talk to us.
00:59:42.870 - 01:00:01.922, Speaker B: Congratulations to Parl. That was amazing. All right, next up we have Steam Tokenizer. Please welcome Steam Tokenizer on stage. All right. Hello everyone. This is a steam tokenizer.
01:00:01.922 - 01:00:37.650, Speaker B: It's basically a tool to bridge gaming from Web Two to web3. So let's do a quick show of hands. Raise your hand if you have ever used the Steam marketplace or you own any Steam game, any in game asset, any skins, CSCO skins or dota games, raise your hand. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. So, yeah, the seed tokenizer basically creates a non fungible token backed by the corresponding asset, the corresponding Steam asset stored in UNESCO. How it works is basically a user directly sends any asset to the bot using the Steam's marketplace interface.
01:00:37.650 - 01:01:28.302, Speaker B: And then the bot creates metadata in a dynamic way and then uses the IPFS network to store all the data in a decentralized way. Now the user has the equivalent as an NFT and can use it to explore the DeFi landscape and other features. And whenever the user wants to get back the Steam asset, they only have to use the burn function within the smart contract. So what are the applications? First of all, obviously buy, sell, and trade the backed NFT through any decentralized marketplace. For example, Openc. Also, you can use the backed NFTs as collateral for loans using any permissionless lending protocol. And Web Three developers can also combine features and games for Web Two to bring the best of both worlds.
01:01:28.302 - 01:01:56.540, Speaker B: So the applications are endless. And now we're going to head to do a quick demo. I have the board running and I'm using only one account. So I'm just going to send it. I'm going to send this MP Seven skin to the bot. And now the bot will just wait for the bot to receive it's, accepting the trade now. And now it's going to start building the metadata using this team API and upload it to the IPFS network.
01:01:56.540 - 01:02:48.162, Speaker B: Right. I'm using only one account, so I'm going to run the interface and grab this link. So basically the bot creates this unique link to mint the NFT using a very simple interface. As we can see in the URL, we parsed all the different parameters of the assets. For example, the name, the hash, the signature, as well as the cooldown period of the item. And now we can mint it. And now we're going to wait a bit for the Rinkab network.
01:02:48.162 - 01:03:36.752, Speaker B: But yeah, the main goal of this is allowing obviously the Steam marketplace to be part of the Web Three ecosystem. It should be confirmed. And now we're going to head to Openc and to see if the metadata is loaded. So here are the other assets using now as NFDS. And we can see the new one and the metadata is going to take a bit to load, but as we can see, it's ID number six, which is the one we minted. Another example of other assets while the new one is loading, for example, is dota item. We can see all the properties fetched from the Steam API, the game, the hero of the slot, the Rarity as well.
01:03:36.752 - 01:03:58.316, Speaker B: And we have the coolant period. That is basically when the user can get back the NFT. And yeah, that's about it. Wow. Web Two to Web Three with an actual massive platform. This is incredible. Congratulations.
01:03:58.316 - 01:04:46.900, Speaker B: Next up, we have reverb. Please welcome Reverb on stage. Do you have any audio? Just video. Let's put it on the mirror setting. Do the mirror or duplicate? You know how? Yeah, just go to the setting, go to Settings Display. You need Internet. Yeah, they told me there's deep Internet.
01:04:46.900 - 01:05:04.070, Speaker B: Okay.
01:05:07.270 - 01:05:15.880, Speaker A: Should you try this one's?
01:05:30.880 - 01:08:06.842, Speaker B: Is nope, never seen this before. This, of course, wouldn't be a hackathon if Murphy's lock doesn't kick in. So we'll give this another minute. How do you change it to it's in Display mode? Where apple. Go to Apple Icon. Okay, thank you. So we are Reverb, and what we built was we built a music platform to connect music artists and listeners together in communities.
01:08:06.842 - 01:08:36.674, Speaker B: And we really wanted to allow listeners of music to show who they really are passionate about and support the artists that they care about. And so here's the platform we built. It's called reverb. So here it's built on top of Lens Protocol. So all of these are NFTs. So any artist profile, any user profile or any song, they're all NFTs. And for example, if you go to Bonnie B, you can mint a token.
01:08:36.674 - 01:09:09.026, Speaker B: So this will follow the user on Lens Protocol, which is on top of Polygon. And if you pay 500 Maddox, you can own one of their NFTs. And once you own NFT for the artist, you can start earning rewards tokens. So our platform, when an artist signs up, we deploy a new ERC 20 contract for them and that's a reward token. And now if you go listen to some of a song on our platform, you'll start earning ERC 20 reward tokens. So this is built off of Superfluid. So every time.
01:09:09.026 - 01:09:52.240, Speaker B: You listen to a song, every time you increase its view count, you'll earn, ERC, 20 tokens through Superfluid, and that's streaming. All the videos are hosted by Live Peer, and we upload those videos onto Lens Protocol. And then this is like my profile, so you can see the different tokens I've collected and the artists that I've minted their membership NFTs. So down here are the membership NFTs. And here's how many tokens I've collected by listening to their songs. And so some of the things that we really want to build out after this are enabling artists to provide merch or early access passes or meet and greet passes to their fans. So you can spend your reward tokens on those types of things.
01:09:52.240 - 01:10:38.250, Speaker B: And, yeah, that's pretty much our platform. Thank you. Congratulations. Next up, we have meshlink. Please welcome Meshlink on stage. And then two more demos to go. Yeah, I'm trying to right now.
01:10:38.250 - 01:11:08.928, Speaker B: Yeah, supposed to be mirrored. Perfect. All right. Hello. How are you guys doing? Cool. I'm going to share this slide show and get going. Let's go there.
01:11:08.928 - 01:11:39.684, Speaker B: All right, cool. So, in the past ten months, over 4 million smart contracts were deployed. That's a great amount of activity, that a lot of things are happening, a lot of things are going. But the funny thing is, there's no easy way to understand what's going on, right? So if you've ever deployed a smart contract, you've understood that either you have to go to Ether Scan, you have to go through custom scripts to basically understand what's going on, right? This is kind of the lay of the landscape. There's a lot of technical solutions. There's the graph, there's Bitquery, there's doing analytics. All these things are pretty technical.
01:11:39.684 - 01:12:20.128, Speaker B: If you want to go in completely non technical side, you can look at Etherscan, right? But the thing is that there's a big opportunity for creating a management platform that's non technical for basically someone who's a product manager or marketing manager. So I hacked on this because I felt the pain. So, for context, earlier this year, I launched a game. It's kind of like Farmville meets Blockchain, whereby it's actually all these smart contracts. There's about 50 smart contracts, there's thousands of transactions, there's millions of tokens flowing through the system. But at the end of the day, what happened was I had no clue what was going on. So what I did is I basically built a bunch of different custom scripts on the graph.
01:12:20.128 - 01:13:04.688, Speaker B: I used Ether Scan crawl that I created a bunch of different Google Docs. At the end of the day, if this was all in a unified platform, it'd make my life a lot easier. And I could assume that since we're all here building things, it'll make a lot of people's lives easier. So if you look at the traditional data market, there's a multi billion dollar business. There's amplitude, there's segment, there's datadog, there's all these companies that make a lot of money, right? So let's actually bring that world into blockchain. So I could walk you through all the crazy things that I developed over this past weekend between the data, denim aggregation, the virtual mongo, the nons at the top. But what I really want to point out here is this concept of a virtual MongoDB, right? So at the base layer of this system, there's this network of crawlers that crawl the blockchain, aggregate a lot of information and actually push that up to IPFS.
01:13:04.688 - 01:13:54.368, Speaker B: So actually what's happening is that all these separate systems are able to pull and aggregate information so that now a front end can easily just query that and have everything in one place. So without further ado, let's run a demo. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over here is a quick dashboard I spun up is basically we'll be end up filling out this dashboard with a bunch of different information, but for now it's blank, right? Let's go over here. So let's take a look at this. So right now the far left side is what's going to be populating from the query from the crawlers. The middle is the kind of API CLI that I created and the top right is a way I can initiate the crawlers. And this bottom right here is actually looking at live IPFS data using storage because a lot of the data is pushed onto IPFS and I kind of create a virtual MongoDB on top of that.
01:13:54.368 - 01:14:28.604, Speaker B: So let's run through the CLI real quick to create an app. So to give you context, right? So if you can think about a blockchain application, it's just a collection of smart contracts talking to each other, right? So what I did is I basically made a way for you to create an easy way to create an app. Kind of think of it as a bucket for all your smart contract operations. So I'm going to go ahead and create a sample one. Hopefully the Wi Fi works perfect. So what it does is basically logs that I as Sheldon, want to actually create an application called Live Stage Demo and it gives me back an API key. And this is actually pretty simply created.
01:14:28.604 - 01:15:09.676, Speaker B: It's stored actually on IPFS right now. Dynamically done. And so what I'm actually do is as well as creating that app, I'm going to now tie a smart contract address to my app, right? So what I'm doing is basically I'm saying I want to track this six smart contract. So this is a smart contract that I'm tracking. So I'm going to go ahead and add in my API key to that. Nice. So what it did now is basically log onto it logs on IPFS that there's now this new app that has this smart contract address that wants to be crawled, right? So now if I go back over to here and actually take my API key that I just created and I paste into here.
01:15:09.676 - 01:15:52.552, Speaker B: This is like a quick way to just kick off my crawler that I made. You're seeing real time as this crawlers are going through all the different transactions that are occurring on that particular smart contract. It's pulling all the data dynamically. It's pulling all the RPC codes. It's actually checking what you're looking at right now is checking on if the addresses are talking to me. Are they smart contracts? Are they users? It's pulling actually the method signatures of the transactions to actually understand for the actions that people are taking, how often they're coming back, what are they doing, what are they also doing, what are kind of the correlation between the actions that you're taking? Because if you ever use like, Segment or Google Analytics, you can actually get a good understanding of what the journey of a person takes as they're going through your web application. So we just saw that this crawler finished.
01:15:52.552 - 01:16:29.844, Speaker B: It's actually completely decentralized. It's all like running by itself and actually refresh here. So we can see now 1000 so 1000 new objects are pushed into IPFS. Right? And now let's take a look back at our dashboard. And perfect. So now you're able to actually pull dynamically the information that occurred for this particular app. It tracked all the transactions, it aggregates all the users of those transactions and actually gives me a nice log of saying for this particular user, for example, they are a returning user and they've done five transactions in the past 24 hours.
01:16:29.844 - 01:17:04.016, Speaker B: Right? And if I scroll down, I can see actually this level of new user logging. So you actually understand what users are new, what users are coming back. Right. And the beauty of it is that now that we have this one concept of an app ID, we can actually take this app ID and compare it to another app ID. So now you can actually get almost like a comparative analysis of for one user base, let's say there's user base of SushiSwap and user base of uniswap. How correlated are they? How often do they go from one to another? How joined are they? Right? So all this level of analytics makes it very easy for people to understand what's going on. So that's all that's happening.
01:17:04.016 - 01:17:12.150, Speaker B: This is meshling. AI. Again. My name is Sheldon Trotman, and I go by King Draco. Dev on Twitter. So thank you. Amazing.
01:17:12.150 - 01:17:29.664, Speaker B: Thank you so much. That was incredible. Can't wait to have others use it too. All right, our second last demo for today Safenote. Please welcome Safenote on stage. Hi there. I'm Stanley, presenting Safenote, an etherpc for end users.
01:17:29.664 - 01:17:53.840, Speaker B: Hey, mom and dad, imagine this, a new announcement in your favorite NFT discord, a free claim for your NFT utility. As you click Submit transaction, an Irreversible spiral begins. As your transaction is sent to an RPC, it's too late. Your ape is gone. Fished blockchain is scary. Once your transaction is mined, there is no taking aback. Blockchain is forever.
01:17:53.840 - 01:18:27.340, Speaker B: Even for those who work full time in crypto, transactions are too much of a black box. I took a screenshot of a contract interaction on MetaMask yesterday. Does anyone know what this does? It's actually set approval for all. If someone signed this, they would have been fished out of all of their NFTs of a particular collection. If we truly wanted to onboard a billion users, we need to take the guesswork out of security. RPCs should be smarter and detect fraud. And Phishing RPCs should make users think twice about submitting dangerous transactions, showing data to help inform this decision.
01:18:27.340 - 01:18:54.932, Speaker B: Welcome to Safenode, a layer of trust. It's simple. Users add it as their RPC and Block Explorer in their wallet. When you first use your RPC, the address that you've interacted with in the past are added as a personal whitelist. So any of your old transactions, it just works just like a normal RPC. But then when a transaction is queued, it means Safenote has firewalled it and hasn't sent it to the Mevcol. It's waiting your approval one more time.
01:18:54.932 - 01:19:32.220, Speaker B: When this happens, we provide data to the user to make the decision for whether this transaction is safe or not. We think that MetaMask's hex dump just isn't super intuitive, so we do this differently. These are the same transaction in MetaMask and Safe node. We simulate the transaction before it's submitted and log all events in the simulation of the transaction, including ERC 20, ERC 721 approvals transfers, et cetera. It's like ether scan, but before you even send the transaction. This is Safe node's transaction simulation, just one element of how we keep users safe. Another layer of protection is to block transactions of addresses on our blacklist.
01:19:32.220 - 01:20:04.072, Speaker B: One example of this would be recently I saw on Twitter that a venture capitalist sent 500,000 USDC to USDC. Thankfully, Circle has an onchain blacklist of their own address, which means the transaction failed. But others aren't so lucky. Reith and Tether each have over $1 million total worth of their respective tokens in their contracts. These are funds that are irrecoverable. Safe nodes blocks transactions to such addresses, but if a user nonetheless wants to sign a transaction and lose funds, they can switch back to infira and send it in two clicks. This blacklist can also be used to block a list of known malicious users.
01:20:04.072 - 01:20:30.816, Speaker B: In fact, blacklists can be combined with in fact, blacklists can be combined with user reporting. Something that's really only possible with web3. Playing on screen now is a full flow of Safe node. From sending a transaction that would have hacked on my paradigm NFTs, to viewing simulation on a Safe node, to reporting an address. Reporting is done through worldcoin's. World ID. Here, the number of reports is shown, and it's CyberProof.
01:20:30.816 - 01:21:03.096, Speaker B: So if you know that 200 real people have reported a particular address, maybe it's a good idea not to interact. But if it looks all good, there's a button at the bottom to submit the transaction, send an answer and submit it to the Mempool. We also have some globally whitelisted contracts and addresses. So, for example, OpenSea, uniswap curve, wrapping and wrapping weave, etc. Interacting with these is the exact same as any other RPC. This idea is similar to the billion dollar industry of SSL certificates and perhaps the main source of revenue. This way Safenode won't be obtrusive enough for you to miss a gas war on the newest mint.
01:21:03.096 - 01:21:24.372, Speaker B: I'd love to create a tokenized version of this as well of tokenized due diligence based on these concepts. Thank you all so much. It's been a grueling, yet a pleasure. Wow. I'm looking for reasons to drop out of school, VC and such. So hit me up on Twitter if you can try that. Thank you guys so much.
01:21:24.372 - 01:21:34.840, Speaker B: Congratulations. All right, please give a giant round of applause for our 10th and the final demo for today Eats Dos. Please welcome him on stage.
01:22:38.460 - 01:22:49.000, Speaker A: No. How do I move on that? Can you do it?
01:22:54.770 - 01:22:58.830, Speaker B: My settings are you'll be quicker.
01:23:11.910 - 01:24:24.970, Speaker A: Yeah. And then the settings are there. Show metering. I think I can just do it. Hi, everyone. I am Adyan, and I'm representing Team ETH Dos, which stands for ethereum degrees of separation. I'm here with three other people, but they couldn't make it to the presentation, so I will be there doing it for them.
01:24:24.970 - 01:25:43.764, Speaker A: So the inspiration for this talk for this project came from something called the Bacon Number. Some of you might be aware of what that is, but the Bacon Number is based on the movie actor Kevin Bacon. And it's how many degrees of separation do other actors have from Bacon? Like, how many times have they co starred in a movie with him? So if someone has co starred in a movie with Kevin Bacon, they would have a Kevin Bacon score of one. And if someone has co starred with someone who has co starred with a movie and with Kevin Bacon, they would have a score of two. So we wanted to do something similar for the crypto community and what we came up with was called the Ethereum Degrees of Separation for your friends and your social graph. So the way it works is there's this origin node, so the way it works is the origin node is the one who starts and can send signatures to all their friends. Basically, they can send these magic cryptographical things to their friends, claiming and then those friends can now claim that they are the Origins Degree One friends.
01:25:43.764 - 01:26:27.024, Speaker A: Now, these Degree One friends can send and generate proofs to their own friends. And now these people become Degree Two friends. You can keep doing this on and on and you can make a whole social graph or a tree with N degrees. Now, the way you would usually do this is you would just have like a graph online and you can see the graph and you can calculate your number. But in crypto we like to spice things up a bit. So we use ZK or zero knowledge cryptography to hide all the paths inside the bacon number or inside the ethereum dos. So the way it works is, say, let's assume for now, like, the Vitalik was the origin.
01:26:27.024 - 01:26:59.784, Speaker A: All of Vitalik's friends would be degree one and they would get a signature. By Vitalik, those guys can generate a zero knowledge. Proof saying that they have received a signature from Vitalik. They can send that proof to their friends. Those guys would be degree two. And now those guys can send they can generate more proofs recursively using recursive ZK SNOX and they can send it to the degree three friends and so on. So now what you can do is you can go on chain and you can cryptographically prove that you are nth degree away from vitalik.
01:26:59.784 - 01:27:48.876, Speaker A: Isn't that quite cool? And then the best part on top of this is that you can mint an NFT and in the spirit of things we would make the NFT like soul bound so that you can't trade it with other people. So the way this would work is you go to ETH ETH x XYZ you type in your friend's address and you click sign and generate a message. This would open up a MetaMask wallet and you would sign it and then it would generate a proof. Generating a proof takes a really long time, about three to four minutes. For this presentation I'll just go to a proof which has already been generated. The proof shows you originator which is who originated the proof, your distance from the originator and a link to share this proof with others. So if you share this proof with others and sign it, they can be distance three.
01:27:48.876 - 01:28:40.990, Speaker A: And with the magic of recursive snarks this is all possible without putting anything on chain or leaking any information about the path. So I would like to show a diagram which shows explains all of this and you can see that the third degree here doesn't actually know about the first degree themselves because this is all zero knowledge and the third degree can actually generate an NFT based on this. So yes, what we've done here I think is pretty incredible because recursive zero snarks are a very new primitive in the crypto community. In fact in sorcom this was only possible until a week, like until maybe like this Wednesday because a bunch of people made circuits which would allow you to recursively do things. So yes, thank you guys.
01:28:56.260 - 01:30:03.356, Speaker B: Thanks to the one person why the slides load up. Please give all those ten amazing projects a big round of applause. All right, so I want to quickly give a big shout out to once again good old Burn My wallet SUKIJI NFT safe launch Pearls, Steam, Tokenizer, Reverb, Mesh, Link, Safenode and It's Tos. These are some incredible themes, what we're seeing here, from being able to protect someone's fund to being able to notify them for various things to simplifying their lives. I think the more we look at what's coming out of these events, the more I get confidence that we're actually solving for all the edge cases that is currently making it hard for people to build in this space and use things that we're building on a day to day basis. And every event we do, I get more bullish because I get to be a lot more closer to using this on a daily basis. So with that, I will try to wrap all of this up in the next 20 minutes depending on how loud the collapse are.
01:30:03.356 - 01:30:39.012, Speaker B: And what I mean by that is we're going to spend the next 50 slides talking about winners that are going to be receiving half a million dollars.

01:42:34.172 - 01:43:12.420, Speaker B: The judges, the volunteers, the mentors, speakers, partners. And without their help and support and physical presence, this would not be literally possible. So I want to start off by thanking 1500 of you that are in this building. You are absolutely amazing. Please give yourselves a massive round of applause because you have been here all day and all night working on things that are exciting to you and you are going to shape what the next few years look like. On top of that, I want to thank all of our amazing judges that spent the last few hours talking to so many of these teams and giving them anywhere from feedback to inspiration, to hope to continue building this space. So thank you to all of our judges.
01:43:12.420 - 01:44:07.870, Speaker B: I want everybody to give a massive round of applause to every single volunteer that has spent countless hours, 24/7, working and making sure everything is on track. Without their help, this event would absolutely fall apart. And of course, some of our amazing mentors who were here just helping, answering questions, just making sure everybody's unblocked, whether it's at the booth or on discord and so many amazing workshops and talks from our speakers. All of this becomes so much more valuable as thousands more who are not able to be here in this building kind of join us and watch all these things online. Thank you to all of our speakers and hundreds of partners that were here supporting 1000 plus hackers in building whatever they wanted to build. Please give a big round of applause to all of our amazing partners. You are absolutely incredible and it's great to see you continue supporting these events, no matter what the market says.
