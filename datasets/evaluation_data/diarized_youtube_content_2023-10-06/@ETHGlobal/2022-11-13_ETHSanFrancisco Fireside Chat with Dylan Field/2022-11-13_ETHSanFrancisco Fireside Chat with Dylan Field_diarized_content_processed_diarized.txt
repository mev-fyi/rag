00:00:06.250 - 00:00:42.410, Speaker A: I do want to get to the prizes, but before that, I want to bring on somebody special. And we have a really interesting talk prepared for interview prepared for our next speaker. I want to bring on Dylan Field, who is the CEO of Figma. Figma, if you don't already know, is a design tool that has taken Silicon Valley by the storm. It it has fundamentally changed how we think about collaboration and just doing design at scale. And we're going to talk about how do we make good products, how do we think about building more consumer friendly applications and all things Web Three. So please join me in welcoming Dylan Field from Figma on stage.
00:00:48.830 - 00:00:49.466, Speaker B: This one? Yeah.
00:00:49.488 - 00:00:52.470, Speaker A: Okay. Hey, Dylan.
00:00:52.550 - 00:00:53.690, Speaker B: Hi, gartic.
00:00:54.030 - 00:00:54.890, Speaker A: How's it going?
00:00:54.960 - 00:01:03.310, Speaker B: It's good. I've been trying to get car t to catch on. It's not working yet. Special K. KT.
00:01:03.730 - 00:01:05.166, Speaker A: Let's stick with KT. That works.
00:01:05.188 - 00:01:06.122, Speaker B: KT. Hey, KT.
00:01:06.186 - 00:01:31.142, Speaker A: I'll go with KT. That's my Starbucks name. Well, there's a lot of things we want to talk about, and I want to figure out how do we not figure? I want to actually blend in a lot of things about good products and web three, but for a lot of the people that are not familiar in the audience, I'd love to kind of learn about how you got into web three, what got you excited, and just kind of what background you have in this space and everything from that beginning.
00:01:31.286 - 00:01:50.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, slow journey, unfortunately. I started getting emails about crypto. Gosh, even 2009, I was on a mailing list 2008, 2009 about hash functions. I think Zuko wrote on the mailing list about this bitcoin thing.
00:01:50.372 - 00:01:51.390, Speaker A: It was a while ago.
00:01:51.540 - 00:02:24.890, Speaker B: And then I had this lecture online about MD Five, and someone reached out and said, hey, there's this bitcoin paper. Can you please read it and tell me what you think? And I was just like, these crazy people with their crazy Internet money. And then I was in the Teal Fellowship, and Vitalik famously was part of that. He emailed the listserv and said, hey, can anyone please read my white paper? No one replied. I lived with Juan from Filecoin protocolabs. He was my roommate. He wrote the IPFS white paper on our table.
00:02:24.890 - 00:02:51.860, Speaker B: I still managed to ignore crypto, but eventually I started dating my now wife. Her name is Elena Not Alinsky, founder of Ironfish, and she was starting to get really excited about ethereum, and that made me dive deep in the sort of 2017 time frame. And I started getting really excited and started to learn the vocabulary more. And I was like, wow, there's a whole world here, and this is extremely exciting. There's so much going on.
00:02:52.470 - 00:02:59.690, Speaker A: Absolutely. And Elena was at the very first ETH Global event five years ago, and that's how I know her. And it's been absolutely incredible.
00:02:59.790 - 00:03:42.734, Speaker B: She said, we were actually with Juan and a bunch of Protocols people, and they're all talking about ethereum. They're like, oh my God, it might cross a she's like, Why were they all so excited? And we went home that night. On the ride home, she starts just like, frantically googling everything ethereum. And I said, well, there's this thing in Canada and I think there are some people that are going to be there. And she went to ETH Waterloo. And at ETH Waterloo, that was when CryptoKitties came out at that first event, and it ended up being a historic event in lots of ways.
00:03:42.852 - 00:04:00.102, Speaker A: Absolutely. And that's how I know you too well. So that was a lot on theory, on how you kind of got more and more into this space. What have you kind of done directly? I know you're involved in a lot of NFT projects just as a collector and also kind of an advisor. We'd love to kind of hear your background. What kind of gets you excited there?
00:04:00.236 - 00:04:44.630, Speaker B: Yeah, I was actually pretty thrilled because three of the six sponsors I'm like, well, I was an investor in those, and I started to get really excited about sort of 2017 time frame. By the way, I don't know how many of you have entered the ecosystem sort of in the last year versus the last 3510 years. It only takes one cycle to be an OG in crypto, which is pretty cool. And so I started to invest in more projects. I actually saw the project that probably got me any street cred in the space was CryptoPunks. And I saw that in 2017 on Reddit, of all places. It was like I had no special knowledge.
00:04:44.630 - 00:05:09.902, Speaker B: And I was just like, this is cool. This seems like legit art pieces, potentially, for ethereum. I got excited about this idea of a crypto collectible. We didn't have the term NFTs yet and started to dive into it. Spent all my winter break that year in 2017, 2018, just like, basically learning about every crypto collectible project there was. Ended up buying this punk. Seven, eight, four.
00:05:10.036 - 00:05:11.102, Speaker A: Tell us more about that.
00:05:11.156 - 00:05:40.290, Speaker B: Sure. I bought it for $14,000 in January 2018, which at that time was absurd, completely absurd. I mean, it was like twelve. ETH was almost as high as it was today, so peak of the bubble at that time period. And I remember telling to Lena, we're getting really serious, and I'm like, is this the stupidest thing I've ever done? And she's like, probably. But Dylan, you won't shut up about it, so please just do it and get over with it and we'll move on. We can enjoy our vacation.
00:05:40.290 - 00:05:58.478, Speaker B: Because I was just like, basically talking nonstop about CryptoPunks for like a week, and for what it's worse, she was talking about deer knowledge stuff for like a week. She was going, is there some way that you could play Battleship on the blockchain without both people knowing where their things are?
00:05:58.564 - 00:05:59.582, Speaker A: Those were interesting times.
00:05:59.636 - 00:06:02.400, Speaker B: So we had a fun conversations for sure.
00:06:02.850 - 00:06:06.030, Speaker A: And tell us how that story ends. About seven eight four.
00:06:06.100 - 00:06:18.638, Speaker B: So seven eight four as crypto punk started to gain steam, I ended up selling it. I missed it a lot. Somebody anonymous in the internet bought it for 4200 e, so it was quite an increase.
00:06:18.814 - 00:06:20.978, Speaker A: Which at the time was seven and a half million.
00:06:21.064 - 00:06:27.000, Speaker B: Yeah, it was the second highest sale at the time. That's the highest sale for a moment and then people beat it really fast.
00:06:28.890 - 00:06:38.774, Speaker A: Well, that was about a year and a half ago. How do you think about NFTs now? Are you still excited about them? Are you still kind of thinking of them as just kind of collectibles? What gets you interested in that category?
00:06:38.902 - 00:07:12.534, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think NFTs are a mixed bag. I think that on one side there is real art that's happening in the NFT space. And I'm super excited about on chain art, super excited about anything that's like the smart contract is part of the art piece. I've never really been a believer of. You have some file somewhere on the internet and the URL isn't a token and that's like an NFT. It just feels like not that innovative to me. I love seeing artists get paid.
00:07:12.534 - 00:08:02.630, Speaker B: So if people are artists and they're getting money from that all the power to them. It's just not what I am that interested in myself. I think over the last year, as more people have gotten excited about the NFT space, there's been more people coming into it. That money also drew people that were scamming, people that were not respecting copyright. And I mean like in a CC zero way, I mean I ripping you off way. And those are some really disturbing things to see, to be honest. And so I also started to see that if you're somebody who had had success in NFTs before, there were a certain class of people who are watching your every move in your wallet and would basically do some really shady stuff to hike up the prices of collections.
00:08:02.630 - 00:08:47.970, Speaker B: And so I started to be afraid of trading for a bit. And I think that NFTs do have some characteristic, as is crypto of the more people that enter a system, the higher the price of a collection can go. And the more people that leave, the lower it might go. It's a little more nuanced than that, but that is the basic characteristic of a collectible art is collectible as well. So I think, overall, I am excited to spend NFTs I think that they're the future of media in a lot of ways, probably. And I think there's so much more to explore for NFTs. But I also am glad that the volume is going down a bit so we can get back to building and we can also make sure that we understand how to guard against some of these behaviors that are less constructive.
00:08:48.790 - 00:09:22.842, Speaker A: Absolutely. Thanks for that. I guess. Maybe one thing I wanted to see how you think about this is that over the last couple of months, we've definitely seen a lot of generative art kind of come in. Dolly GPT-3 GitHub's Code Pilot Mid Journey a lot more experiments that are just kind of making easier for us to kind of think about art that would just either not be possible or just is way beyond what we think is human capable. Do you think that sort of changes how we think about that entering in web three or just overall in this space? How do you think that affects this ecosystem?
00:09:22.986 - 00:09:55.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, first of all, the idea of an art dow that's actually autonomous is really cool. If you had a sort of AI system that's emitting art and that art is then being sold and there's sort of something that's self perpetuating, truly without any human in the loop, I think that's a really cool idea. I think that some of the general models are probably not that relevant to crypto right now, unless you're using it to create more work.
00:09:56.750 - 00:10:05.920, Speaker A: Or maybe it helping in this way, have artists earn more money because this is fundamentally a way for them to also make some income from their work.
00:10:06.450 - 00:10:45.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that if there was a way to, for example, trace back to artists that are maybe part of the train data and somehow create a crypto scheme to make it so that those artists are paid, that could be really cool. I think that there's probably a lot more of the story to be written about AI art and crypto, but I think it is kind of amusing that up until the recent move to Proof of Stake, we had sort of these, like, three warring camps. We had crypto, we had people that liked AI and people like gaming, and they're all like, Er, we want GPUs. So I feel like it was kind of an adversarial relationship for a while, but maybe starting to cool a little bit.
00:10:45.870 - 00:11:10.020, Speaker A: I think that's definitely happened with Proof of Stake in the last two months. And I also think it perfectly coincides with all the generative art kind of becoming popular because you just have thousands of GPUs now. All right, enough about some of the web three themes that we're excited about. Let's kind of switch gears on thinking about making good products. I'll keep this vague, but kind of from your perspective, what makes a good product or maybe a good consumer product?
00:11:10.390 - 00:11:47.040, Speaker B: Well, I think a good product is one that solves a problem. Something that is designed with empathy is straightforward. And on the consumer side, I think people have even less tolerance for that. They really care if you're making a consumer product, to have no friction. And so I think for something like Figma, where sometimes it takes quite a while to ramp up, as a new user, we try to make it as simple as possible. I think about a staircase metaphor where that first step should be very easy to take and over time you can gain mastery as you progress up those stairs. And that was a metaphor that I think Rasmus originally made.
00:11:47.040 - 00:11:54.320, Speaker B: But I think for consumer, it's like those steps have to be tiny at first, otherwise it just never takes off.
00:11:54.690 - 00:12:01.026, Speaker A: And that's specifically for consumer? You mean is it specifically for a consumer product or any product? Yeah.
00:12:01.048 - 00:12:16.550, Speaker B: I think you want the onboarding and the ease of use for any product to be really straightforward. But I think for consumer especially, that's the case. And if not trying to to able make it really easy to onboard into, then you can't reach the Kindergartners and their kindergarten teachers.
00:12:17.530 - 00:12:42.526, Speaker A: Yeah, the classic if your mom can't use it, it's not mainstream yet. Kind of on a similar theme. I think a common criticism that Web Three gets is that it's a solution looking for a problem or we're not really sure these are mass scale problems. How do you think about do you have any frameworks for evaluating product market fit or what do you think kind of constitutes this is actually solving a problem or a need?
00:12:42.708 - 00:13:10.486, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that there's a little bit too much emphasis sometimes in crypto on price going up. Right. It makes sense because that's like the metric that everyone gets and it's really easy to keep track of. But at the end of the day, if you're not solving a problem for someone, doesn't matter. Right. And so I think that usage is undervalued in crypto and price is probably overvalued. And so I hope to see more products that are really focusing on making something that's useful for people.
00:13:10.486 - 00:13:28.910, Speaker B: And I think that we're starting to see that. I think that people are really getting the message. And I also think that this is a unique time where we have a chance to hunker down when prices are deflated a bit and really focus on the building and making sure that we're solving core problems. And I'm really excited to see what's going to come out of this period.
00:13:29.810 - 00:14:08.658, Speaker A: There are 1700 people in this building and we're going to see a few hundred of these things come out on Sunday. So I am sure we're going to see initial waves of what kind of happened. So that's definitely going to be exciting. Maybe kind of going back in time a little bit. I think when you started Figma, it was fundamentally changing how people think about design. Collaborative on Web was not really as a common kind of practice and you kind of had to figure this out over a few years. How did you kind of think about those moments where you were not sure there's uncertainty on will people want this? Or you really believe this is how everything should work, but people were really not sold.
00:14:08.658 - 00:14:17.600, Speaker A: How do you think about kind of battling through those moments, or kind of how do you think about just powering through this and where do you get the will and what's a good way of thinking about this thing as founders think about building companies?
00:14:17.970 - 00:15:01.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you have to form a hypothesis of where you think the world is going. You have to then validate that hypothesis as much as possible. And the hard part is when you're trying to validate the hypothesis and the validation is not coming, but you really believe it's true. And I think that's like the part that no one can teach. For us. Yeah, for us, multiplayer editing was that way, web was that way. So we asked people, do you want a design tool on the web? And they're know, do you want to work with multiple people, like in a Google doc on designs? And everyone basically said, no, there were like one or two people that we found that were interested in that, but otherwise people thought, this makes no sense.
00:15:01.834 - 00:15:38.214, Speaker B: But as we built it and we tried ourselves, we saw that there's real value, and we also saw that it didn't work if you didn't have some way to actually have that multiplayer collaboration. And so our own experience led us to believe this is very important. And we went all in on it, and I think it ended up being the main differentiator of figma. And eventually people came around, but there was some faith there. And I think that if you have that faith, if you feel that strongly, and you can do that over a long period of time, then sometimes there's rewards and sometimes you are ahead of the curve, though. And I think the hard part is knowing the timing. Sometimes you are far too early.
00:15:38.214 - 00:16:05.726, Speaker B: So we were talking about dows earlier, the sponsors, aragon. Right. Amazing project, and still going, but I think somewhat ahead of its time. Absolutely. And there's plenty of projects in crypto that are similar in terms of they were started so early, and it took a while for the rest of the ecosystem to catch up and go, wow, this is actually a problem that we need to solve right now. I'm sure you could rattle off like.
00:16:05.748 - 00:16:07.780, Speaker A: Twelve off top of your head, at least. Yes.
00:16:10.230 - 00:16:34.780, Speaker B: We'Ll remember those. Well, we don't remember the ones that came too late. Right. But it ends up being that if you're just on time, that's really important for figma. We were on time because WebGL was a new technology that existed with the introduction of WebGL, made it so we could actually build this in the browser, use the GPU in the browser, and make it very efficient. Whereas e, four people had to use flash. It was too slow, and you couldn't make a professional grade tool online at that time.
00:16:36.510 - 00:17:07.042, Speaker A: And I think the thing to comment here is that what you said is definitely true for the product side. And I think we kind of already see this behavior work really well in Web Two and web Three, which is everything in the infrastructure side, follows the same pattern. The WebGL argument here, it had to be there for you to actually build something that would delight the end user. And sometimes these things take time or they're just not performant yet. And we're kind of seeing that happen especially as we're going to see how the L Two ecosystem have evolved in web three and now suddenly stable coins and stablecoins just kind of getting mass.
00:17:07.096 - 00:17:22.326, Speaker B: Production market, you name it. There's so much that is evolving in Ethereum ecosystem that's now these building blocks that are made possible and you can come to a hackathon like ESF and you can just go hack and build an amazing two days, whereas before it was not possible to build some of these things at all.
00:17:22.428 - 00:17:35.646, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's a good measure of a growing developer platform because if things just become pluggable and componentized, that's when you get to a point where you just don't have think about how something's going to work, it just works and you build on the actual problem that you.
00:17:35.668 - 00:17:45.470, Speaker B: Want to solve and I know you won't do it yourself. So I'll brag for you so much. That is due to the work of the ETH Global team. So I think we can maybe give the ETH Global team a round of applause.
00:17:45.550 - 00:18:30.474, Speaker A: Thank you. And it's supportive everybody here because we pulled out the event, but they do all the work. So I feel slightly uncomfortable taking the credit, but the rest of the team definitely deserves a big round of applause. A couple of other things. Well, one thing we've definitely seen in the last two years is a lot of companies in Web Two are getting more and more interested in Web Three, whether it's integrations, coming up with their own solutions or their own competition. And a lot of them are starting to integrate and launch things at scale for hundreds of millions to billions of users. Do you believe that's kind of the only way to think about mass adoption? Or do you believe that more companies in this space are going to become category leaders and kind of actually displace them because they're Web Three native?
00:18:30.602 - 00:19:23.998, Speaker B: I think it's a combination of both. I think we'll see Web Three companies take that main stage and make it so that they're able to, some cases disrupt incumbents, some cases probably more cases create new areas that hadn't ever existed before. I think that Web Two entrants should be welcome though, and I think that when you have these entrants that are going to make it so that more people know about Ethereum, about crypto in general, and they'll be onboarding all sorts of new customers and users in the space and developers. I think that's a good thing. And so I think it's sometimes tough because oftentimes in order to make the user experience really good. There's some element of centralization that happens. And obviously, decentralized computing is such a part of the value set of web three and of this ecosystem, and the.
00:19:24.004 - 00:19:27.550, Speaker A: Correlation between centralization and distribution is also very strongly tied.
00:19:27.630 - 00:19:38.290, Speaker B: Exactly. And so also user experience, though, and I think, though, that even when that tension exists, I think it's worth calling out, but ultimately it's important to welcome those players.
00:19:41.500 - 00:20:06.564, Speaker A: I kind of want to well, this is extremely helpful. And yeah, I don't think it's a bad thing at all. If we see big tech companies integrate anywhere from web three primitives to just direct protocols in their application flow, I think that's a win for our space, because it gets more people excited, it gets more people in improving those platforms, and fundamentally, we win at the end of the day, all of us. Also.
00:20:06.602 - 00:20:12.640, Speaker B: This thing is amazing. Like, five years ago, could you even imagine having this? Like, that would be just wild.
00:20:12.720 - 00:20:28.628, Speaker A: I mean, to just name them directly. Facebook launched a billion plus users getting access to NFTs on Instagram, and that's still insane. It's an actual announcement. You can buy these things on Instagram. And I would have never assumed this would be a reality, and you can't.
00:20:28.724 - 00:20:30.970, Speaker B: We didn't even have the term NFT five years ago.
00:20:31.280 - 00:20:53.776, Speaker A: We definitely did not. So just the momentum is absolutely insane. And these things kind of come out of events like these. I want to end off by asking something a little bit more serious, which I think you're in the perfect position to give advice on. We've kind of seen just elephant in the room. The economy is not doing that great. We're seeing interest rates hiked up.
00:20:53.776 - 00:21:15.464, Speaker A: There's an energy crisis. People are anywhere from mass layoffs to people are just worried about what the next couple of years would look like. If you're entering in this market as a founder or as a developer, how would you think about structuring the next couple of years, especially when you're starting a company? Are there any advice you can give on how do you think about building successful companies? What should people be mindful of?
00:21:15.662 - 00:21:59.712, Speaker B: Yeah, the main advice I'd give anyone who's starting a company right now is I would say make sure you have enough time to do it right and to actually go all the way and really test your vision. For Figma, we were super lucky and privileged to have the support of the Teal Fellowship, and that was basically two years of capital. So $100,000 over two years. Amazing. I think that what ended up happening was that six months in, if we had said, okay, six months is our checkpoint, and if we're doing well, we'll keep going. If not, I'll go back to school. I would have gone back to school kind of like head to my legs because fall back.
00:21:59.712 - 00:22:51.110, Speaker B: No, it's not bad, but Figma wouldn't be here because six months in we were still figuring it out and it wasn't even a year end we were still figuring out we didn't start charging it took more than money until five years in right? Could we done it earlier? Sure, but maybe four years, not five years. This stuff just takes time and I think that especially when you have the dynamic in web three in crypto of having to build a community as well the good news is that you're surrounded by this amazing community and they're so receptive and so willing to help. The hard news is that you have competition too in terms of mindshare and it doesn't happen overnight. It requires so much effort, so much energy in order to build that ecosystem, those networks, those communities and so my main advice would be to persevere but also to plan ahead financially and make sure you've got some time.
00:22:52.520 - 00:22:59.880, Speaker A: I think that's a perfect note to end this on. I want to thank you for taking the time tonight and I really appreciate you being here please give grabbing me killing a big round of applause.
00:22:59.960 - 00:23:00.570, Speaker B: Good luck everybody.
