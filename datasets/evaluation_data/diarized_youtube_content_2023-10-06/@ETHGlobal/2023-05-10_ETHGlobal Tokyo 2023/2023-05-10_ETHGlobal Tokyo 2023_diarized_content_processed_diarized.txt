00:00:10.890 - 00:00:24.122, Speaker A: Genuinely excited about this. Like having the East Global I'm part of the Ethereum Foundation, so I've seen many, many hacks in the different places and then I was really, really hoping that that happens in Tokyo.
00:00:24.266 - 00:00:28.440, Speaker B: I love Japan. This is so cool. This is my first time and I love it.
00:00:36.890 - 00:01:01.870, Speaker C: In Japan, there's a whole movement of web3 taking over. And it's not just like, I think enterprises, but also government is very keen. I actually met some government representative in some of the meetups and stuff. So the attention you're getting from Japanese local towards Web Three is insane. So I think this was great time in the East Global actually came all the way to Japan.
00:01:02.450 - 00:01:28.940, Speaker D: In Japan, they all love collectibles. I don't have to explain what we do. They get it immediately and it's like, yeah, this is like and they have plenty of examples. You go to a national park and depending like you see a waterfall and you get a sticker and then you see some other bird sanctuary and you get a little birdie thing. For us, poop, this is greatly validating. So we love it.
00:01:47.330 - 00:02:10.520, Speaker E: The word Infinite garden, the word infinite is from this book called Finite and Infinite Games. And the finite games are the one that laker. Normally people play finite games and then when someone wins, the game ends. But infinite games are played for the purpose of continuing the game.
00:02:13.450 - 00:02:27.020, Speaker B: My very first hackathon, like sitting in my hotel room in the middle of the night, like building a pogs game with commit, reveal, randomness. I still remember that and I am so fond of it and I love it so much.
00:02:27.870 - 00:02:51.140, Speaker F: I would say don't be afraid to try out new ideas. I've seen so many hackers that are like solo hacks and they're like, oh, I have this idea, but I don't have a team and I don't know if I can go ahead with it. And I'm like, do it, build it first and try to inspire others. Also, I think it's a really good testing ground that if you are able to get members, it probably means your idea is a good one and if not, pivot and see how you can shape it up.
00:02:51.510 - 00:03:13.080, Speaker G: Web Three is like growing right? A lot in Asia and a lot in places where the assumption that everyone speaks English very well is a bad assumption to make. So where do we come in with translating our documentation? How do we support the local community? And I think that's been something that's been really cool at East Tokyo and definitely insights to take back to the team.
00:03:13.450 - 00:03:32.302, Speaker H: What actually kind of drew me in first was that when I first learned about Ethereum, I got the vision, but I didn't understand how it saw the why but not the how. But I was just like, okay, the people involved in this would be super smart. And one thing I've learned is that people that are very smart and earnest while making the world a better place. Generally, over time, they have a way of figuring it out. So I was like, I'm just going to bet on the people and then.
00:03:32.356 - 00:03:44.990, Speaker F: I'll go from there's.
00:04:03.130 - 00:04:06.150, Speaker A: Being playful is going to be curious.
