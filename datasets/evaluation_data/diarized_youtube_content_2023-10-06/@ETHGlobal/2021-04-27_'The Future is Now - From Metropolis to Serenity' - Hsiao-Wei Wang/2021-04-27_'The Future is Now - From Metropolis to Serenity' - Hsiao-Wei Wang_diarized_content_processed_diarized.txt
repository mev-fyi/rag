00:00:00.170 - 00:00:17.680, Speaker A: I want to welcome our very first talk of the day. The talk is titled Features Now from Metropolis of Serenity. And this is going to be a talk given by Xiaoi. She's already here. I'll have her turn her video on and really kick us off with the very first talk. And thank you so much for kicking us off today.
00:00:18.690 - 00:00:31.862, Speaker B: Thanks Kartik. Let me share my screen. Could you see the screen?
00:00:31.996 - 00:00:33.000, Speaker A: Great, perfect.
00:00:33.610 - 00:01:01.280, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Thank you everyone. So my topic is about the future is now. And from the petropolis to Serenity. I'm Xiao Wei, researcher at Eastern Foundation. You can find me by these handles. And here we are.
00:01:01.280 - 00:02:19.880, Speaker B: So first these pictures are taken after the East London. Last year some of our team visited the British Museum thanks to global Yay. And the right picture was taken by Diedrich, aka the Protolamda as an Ethereum nerd. It was me taking a picture of the Byzantine gold coins. So these Byzantian coins were minted in Constantinople over a thousand years. And just a couple of years ago iseran used Byzantine and Constantinople as the release cones. So when I visited the museum by that time I was wondering if each line of a code on the Eastern history today will be read and be used by people after 1000 years.
00:02:19.880 - 00:03:10.790, Speaker B: So yeah, that's the magic of the history. And I think we can actually learn a lot from the past and to build the better future. So here we are. These are Ethereum release releases and say it's the faces. Everything was landed in 2015. In July the POW, the proper work chain landed. So we started from the frontier with very small community supporters.
00:03:10.790 - 00:05:17.010, Speaker B: Then the next release was the home state which provides some stabilized upgrades that just as an announcement how to tell the people that our server is ready to vote, future upgrades. And then since 2017 to now, we are in the age of the Metropolis. So the ecosystem growing bigger and bigger. We have established the government system like the EIP process and by design review and implemented this AIPS. We have a lot of the eva enhancements and block reward adjustments in the past few years and Metropolis is still continuous growing and at the same time the next stage, the Serenity stage is already happening right now the Serenity contains the proper stake and scaling solutions. So what is Serenity? So I'd say we sometimes code it like Serenity is 2.0, but generally the Serenity ish and the timeline was like the things happened before the mouthpaper in.
00:05:17.010 - 00:06:36.380, Speaker B: I think it was 2016 by Talik. And by that time there were just a couple of researchers in the early years, and maybe the founders of Ethereum have started to do the prophet stake study and research. And then we have the hybrid consensus stage. I will talk explain that later. And now we are at the beacon chain research and the merge research and development. These stages might be impellerable in some way because each topic can be done by a small group of people and then growing, growing to be implemented in the manage. So the mouthpaper, I think maybe the most client developers has read this paper.
00:06:36.380 - 00:07:42.810, Speaker B: So back to 2019, the basic shape of ethereum 2.0 has already been established and in this paper lab we have like six main goals. First of course, we want to remove the proper work to have a more efficient profile, state consensus and things like fast block time and economic finality. These properties can go with the proof of stake automatically. And then we want to scale the ethereum. In this paper the main design is the shard chain design. So the shark chain is like you have multiple side chains, but the side chain is not the shy chain.
00:07:42.810 - 00:08:51.240, Speaker B: Listen to the mention. The mention also has to listen to the sha chain from time to time. So by this communication from the mention to the side chain and then we can implement the crowdshot communication via the core mention. And then the last one is the censorship resistance. It's like if we want to if we want to remove the proper work, then we will need to found the leader of the blockchain, of the certain block every time. The risk is that if a rich attacker have enough staking power, then could it censorship the blockchain easily. So we want to reduce that possibility as we can.
00:08:51.240 - 00:10:12.130, Speaker B: So back to the early stage, what lessons we learned from the Casper proof of stake. So this is the Casper FFG paper. So in a very long time ago that there are already some main properties that today in the beacon chain we used, for example, we have the validators to make deposits on the current chain. So that if the validator doing something badly, then sorry, let me see. So if the data do something bad, then they will take the economic flash. So if they did something good, then they will get incentive rewards from the protocol. Also the proof of stake protocol provides the settlement finality or we said the economic finality.
00:10:12.130 - 00:11:49.540, Speaker B: And also we proved that the Casper FG can guarantee the accountable safety and the if you are interested in learning Casper, you can go read this paper back to today. It's still very useful. Let's see. And also the lesson we learned about sharding. So sharding is also not novel even in a few years ago. But there are some bottleneck that make it difficult to be useful today. For example, the computation ability and networking capacity if you have one blockchain and how could you scale to 64 or thousands of chains? And then also it has the same issue as the Casper after proof of stake system, because you have to select some of the validators to prove that again to validate the certain block is correct.
00:11:49.540 - 00:12:45.422, Speaker B: And then these lessons we learned and then to make it step by step. The first practical implementation was the hybrid consensus FFG. So this is a basic outline of the version of design. You can see that there are two different contracts. One is the Casper contract and another is the Shading manager contract. So in this design there were two different contracts. And each contract we accept validator will make deposit on each contract.
00:12:45.422 - 00:14:48.010, Speaker B: And then if each contract controls the consensus in the contract layer and then if Validator want to make vote to prove that they have attest some certain history, then they have to make EVN transaction to the contract. So yeah, that was the decide back to and except that for example, Casper FFG will change the focus rule and the image contract will of course change the architecture largely. So what we learned from that stage is that we learned how to do some blockchain, how to provide the blockchain randomness. So, as I said, the censorship resistance is important. So it's important to make the attacker to be very difficult to manipulate the randomness result. So the most popular and practical approach including the Rendell and BDS, which is the future Ethereum might use. And the second one is by studying Sharding, then we know that the data availability is really important and also to decide the future Shardings like statelessness, the stateless client and the account abstraction, the account abstraction contract.
00:14:48.010 - 00:15:47.070, Speaker B: These different new chain features are likely to be used in the later event. Or that's what the east one point X is working on. And then the Casper FFG research. So the FFG research back to them already formed the slashing condition rules and the procedure to handle the inactivity leak penalty. So these things are still being used today. But finally the hybrid Casper is doable but the Sharded hybrid Casper is really hard. So, back to them.
00:15:47.070 - 00:16:56.526, Speaker B: We realized that we should have started with a new form of profile station. So let's open the beacon chain age. So, here we are. This is the overview of the picture of the beacon chain design. We will edit the beacon chain which is full pop up section to provide finality randomness and the core of the chart chains to anchor on. So we already have like four production available is to buy when on the day one we launched the beacon chain last year. So, yeah, shout out to the Pi devs now to today we already have over 3.9
00:16:56.526 - 00:18:39.490, Speaker B: million Ethers are in Staking and over like 122,000 Validators are running their beacon node and Validator client. So learning from the beacon churn R and D, we are still learning. The first is validator client and we can churn separation is good because it's more flexible and more scalable. Also if you separate the data client which handled validating with the keys and the beacono handle the network p to P network then we can make the key management more secure. And also the staking user experience is really important. It includes how newbie staker learn to manage let keys and to make deposit and to upgrade the software. So I'd like to thank to the staker community they really helped a lot and the last thing is I think the devs generally likes the incrementalism patches in development.
00:18:39.490 - 00:20:12.158, Speaker B: So example like we will have the first beacon chain hub fork called Hot air this year which will increase some features of the light clients and in the future IMD they are already in process but in pellaroli so each patches in the different code base we can merge it. It's not necessary to be one should be before another or another should be after another. Then the merge finally it's the merge summit. So yeah, the merge is about merging the current east one magnet and the East Two magnet to be one Ethernet. So it's the previous picture, but the differences is that we add the proof of work block into the beacon block. But we don't have to include the whole block because the mining will be disabled by Len. So it's only the extrusion payload will be included in the beacon block.
00:20:12.158 - 00:22:23.674, Speaker B: So after the merge the beacon chain will become an executable beacon chain and to learn more, the talk after list will show you the full picture of the merge by lectureman after me. And if you want to learn more about the post merge ethereum Talik will talk about hot counts after the merge today. But what about you want to participate in now then if you want to communicate and found some interesting issues to hack, we're welcome to go to the RND discord server. Thanks to Proto for making this fabulous website URL and all. The East One is one point X. East two developer discussions are unlat, so it's now the new development hub now for Eastern community and also we have the East Research forum so we can go to the East Research ch and found the East Two transition category that's the merge related Topics. But if you want to learn other topics, other scaling topics, there are also many layer two scaling solutions like row ops on that and also you can start with the Good first issue today to find a project that you're interesting in and then read contribute guide on that and pick one tackle and issue.
00:22:23.674 - 00:23:44.040, Speaker B: Maybe try to use the Good first issue label and also just want to let you know that don't be scared to ask unless Trinas you see like GitHub or Discord or maybe GitHub. So I think the open source software community are usually really glad to see the contributors are coming. So want to say is that the historic history is not very long yet, but it's good because we can took the lessons from the past the previous work built the previous work by the early researchers the authors helped build our prison and from the metropolis to Serenity we are building the future right now. Thank you for your time. I talked too long.
00:23:50.490 - 00:24:30.150, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Shaoi, this was a really good overview of how we got from all of our initial attempts to look at any from charting to Casper to FFG to the Gadgets and now we're at the Merch. So I think you did a really awesome talk job at just setting the context into what's been tried before. And that really sets us up for the rest of the day because we're going to have a lot more details on how everything that you talked about has affected the state of the Merge and just what happened with you too. With that, I want to thank you for giving this very first talk for today and also for staying up super late to do this from your time zone.
00:24:30.810 - 00:24:42.550, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. So it's an overview, so hope you will enjoy the letter presentations.
00:24:42.890 - 00:24:57.900, Speaker A: Thank you. I think just to kind of make sure that I address one single comment, we have a question from Gabriel, who is asking, what was the link to the discord server? I believe it's just e two WTF and discord eats two WTF. Is that correct?
00:24:59.310 - 00:25:04.540, Speaker B: Let me go to that page again. Let.
00:25:10.230 - 00:25:13.586, Speaker A: We'Ll type that up on the chat as well and we'll coordinate that.
00:25:13.768 - 00:25:15.458, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:25:15.624 - 00:25:21.600, Speaker A: We'll just write that answer in the chat. So thank you so much. And with that, we are ready to move on to our next talk.
