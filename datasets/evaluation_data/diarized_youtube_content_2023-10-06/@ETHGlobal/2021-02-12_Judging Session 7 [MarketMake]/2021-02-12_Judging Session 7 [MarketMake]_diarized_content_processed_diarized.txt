00:00:03.530 - 00:01:40.540, Speaker A: I'm going to do a verbal reach out to the first team, although everyone should be looking in the chat. So we'll be calling the teams in the chat, and you'll see that the first team is Team Conjure. If you could just raise your hands, it stand by as I begin session here's. Everyone's joined to session seven of the Market Make hackathon. Judging here's just a quick run through to remind everyone. For this event, which has lasted a little over three weeks of hacking, 490 hackers from 58 countries, 17 time zones, over 120 projects have been submitted. I'll run through real quick the format of today's judging session.
00:01:40.540 - 00:02:50.210, Speaker A: Each project team will have four minute video that they'll play at the start. So whoever from your team has that role, they should start their video presentation right at the top, and then four minutes for Q A with the judges. About every four teams will do a quick two to three minute break, and then at the halfway mark, we'll do a longer break. Um, judging. We have five broad categories that the judges have all been briefed on. There's technicality originality, the practicality of your hack, the UI, UX, and DX, and the wow factor. And with all the east not to be competition, especially in these interactions with the judges, it's a great place to learn.
00:02:50.210 - 00:03:33.532, Speaker A: There's no sense that the hacks have to be aimed at becoming a business. You're here to get quality feedback and to just sort of work your idea in sort of a public space, like to do a brief intro. And thanks ahead of time. For our judges, we have Nicholas Santoni from Len miscap, patrick McCrory from Pisa, and Mariano Conte from Great Guy. Thanks, you guys, for doing this for us. We'll start the demos. I will end my screen share and our first Team Conjure.
00:03:33.532 - 00:04:00.100, Speaker A: You can start your share. Remember to share audio and we can begin. Hello. This is our demo for Conjure, a platform that let anyone create any synthetic assets with any oracle. And I will now start by playing our demo. Hello. We are Team Conjure, and I'm excited to show you what we built for the Market Make Hackathon.
00:04:00.100 - 00:04:58.808, Speaker A: My name is Mario and I will guide you through our presentation and this demo. So we built a decentralized app which lets you create synthetic assets using arbitrary oracles and which are collateralized using ETH. The main idea was to let users create arbitrary assets with any oracle types they want to, and also to create basket sins, which are basically brand new assets. For example, we allow users to create their very own basket currency to hedge against monetary policy risk by putting multiple currency pairs together. So under the hood, we are creating an ESC 20 Token, which is the base for the newly minted sims. We support different oracle types with templates for chain link and uniswap, but also allowing the user to use custom oracles so anything they want to. Finally you have to provide ease as a collateral to mint the actual sims.
00:04:58.808 - 00:05:31.924, Speaker A: So now let's jump right into the demo. So we are now on the main page of our debt. So in this example we are using Market and make. Then we click on the Create your Control Asset button. This then takes us to the Manage page where we can init the asset to be created. Let's look at the init process in detail. Here we have the ability to select from various asset types and create a single asset with various price feeds to hedge against one price feed going down and take the median price here.
00:05:31.924 - 00:06:19.824, Speaker A: Or we can create a completely new asset which is basically the weighted average of all the prices we selected. The creator can also select a minting fee up to 2.5%. In this example we're going to create a basket asset which consists of the following we select 30% Australian Dollar USD 40% Euro 30% Great Bridge Pound your asset is now created and ready to use. You can see a detailed screen where you have all the info about the asset and links to the used Oracles where you also can see the weights. Next step is for the end user. On this screen you are able to take out loans on the created asset. To open a new loan you can select the amount which you want to mint.
00:06:19.824 - 00:07:05.808, Speaker A: This brings up a 230% collateral ratio in our example. So for example if we can take a loan we click here on Open Loan. If the transaction went through you can see all your loans here. On this tab you are able to deposit more ETH as collateral, also withdraw some ETH and also to close the loan. Also we have added a global tab where you can see the total amount of circulating supply and the number of open loans in the system. So in the background we are using Next JS as a framework for building the front end which is hosted on Netlify for automatic build processing. There are two contract factories, one for the ESC 20 Token and one for the collateral contract of the synth.
00:07:05.808 - 00:08:00.870, Speaker A: For the collateral contract we took main pieces from synthetics IO and adopted them for our use case. Basically you are able to create your own synth with just two transactions and have a complete collateral system included. So for future work we want to do the main deployments for the contracts and make the DApp generally available. Also we are already working to recreate new and more synthetic asset types, also want to improve the UI and also provide a Loan Explorer to see all the different loans in the system. So you can already check it out live directly on Conjure Keychain. Me, I had a lot of fun working on this project for the Market Make hackathon and thank you very much for your time. So thank you for watching our video and we're now open for questions.
00:08:00.870 - 00:09:01.640, Speaker A: Let's do it. Hi. I guess I'll start. I think it's a very interesting way that you do it. I'm wondering if you got to the part where you thought about liquidations on collateralized loans. So basically in the UI this is on our to do list, we still have to implement it so the user will be able to do this kind of transactions on the UI, but on the back end or on the solidity contracts we already have them included. So you can also do not only the withdraw ETH and deposit more ETH for the collateral, you can also repay the loan and also you can liquidate loans if you are messing with the contracts directly.
00:09:01.640 - 00:09:44.752, Speaker A: Cool, thank you. For the price Oracles, have you considered using the uniswap price Oracle? I noticed it was just chain link being pressed. Have you considered any on chain Oracles and the problems that so basically right now we have three Oracle types included. The first one is basically the normal chain link price feeds we are using. In this case for the Rinky B testnet because we are not on Mainet yet. The second is custom Oracle so you can use any contracts call you want to. And the third one is we're using a custom uniswap Oracle which is basically gives you the prices from the weighted average price from uniswap.
00:09:44.752 - 00:10:30.450, Speaker A: But we haven't it live on Rinkib but it's available for the main net contracts. Then what are the gas costs associated with that? Oh, sorry, you go ahead Nicole. First and I'll keep going of course. I just want to ask that the gas costs were involved with, as I say, minting a new asset. So you want to know the gas gas costs if you create the asset or you create the loan? Both I guess. Just so for opening a loan, I checked today, it's around like four hundred k in gas. And for the first question I can't answer that in detail, I haven't looked it in detail.
00:10:30.450 - 00:11:44.170, Speaker A: Look, in terms of assets and major use cases that you see in maybe different version down the line, what do you think it best suited for? So on the one hand, if you don't just want to rely on one Oracle price feed like for example chainlink, you can hook up other price feeds for the same asset type. Like, for example, WPTC? And if one price goes down, you can retake the median price. So you can take up one or two like unlimited assets there. And the second asset type we have available is where you can hedge against the monetary policy risk. So for our example, we put like Euro Australian dollar and Great British pound together created a basket synth and this takes then the average price. And for future work we are also taking a look in creating indices where we want to take the market cap and also the square root market cap, so you can do indices here as well. Very nice.
00:11:44.170 - 00:12:18.130, Speaker A: It seems pretty intuitive, the way the users can interact. Would be obviously good to have a sort of, like, risk management tool in a sense, right. Where you can see your collateral and how is evolving with the price moving and have a quick way out or maybe a threshold. Thank you for the input. That's definitely on our list. So we want really to improve the UI and also the features for the end user. Good stuff.
00:12:18.130 - 00:12:28.230, Speaker A: That's awesome. That puts us at time. Thanks, Conjure. That was an awesome presentation. Thank you. Much appreciated. Good work.
00:12:28.230 - 00:12:52.924, Speaker A: Our next team is Audits are dead. If you can share your demo video, we will begin. Hey, guys. Really excited to show you what we've got today. Meet Alice. Alice doesn't know much about crypto. She's a chef, and she's too busy to look into it.
00:12:52.924 - 00:13:34.928, Speaker A: She's heard good things about it from her brother Bob, but she still isn't convinced. I think it needs to load or maybe can restart. Did we lose the video? Seems like it's loading or stopping. Maybe it just started again. Can you guys not see it? We can see it just stopped. Froze to me. Really? Okay, let me restart it.
00:13:34.928 - 00:14:21.600, Speaker A: Yes, just restart. You may want to stop sharing and share again, because for me, it stopped at three minutes, 40 seconds. Okay. All right. Trying to share again. Share screen. Remember to share audio.
00:14:21.600 - 00:14:34.550, Speaker A: Yep. All right. Meet Alice. Alice doesn't know much about crypto. She's a chef, and she's too busy to look into it. She's heard good things about it from her brother. That was good.
00:14:34.550 - 00:15:07.436, Speaker A: But she still isn't convinced. Yes. She looks into DeFi and notices that it doesn't seem super safe. Then she finds out about auditors, but learns that even audited protocols get hacked sometimes. Finally, she finds insurance, and she feels much better. But the price of insurance is too high for her, and they keep asking hard questions, like when she'll take her money out. After all this, Alice decides she isn't ready for DeFi and goes back to her bank.
00:15:07.436 - 00:15:38.680, Speaker A: She can't help but wonder why DeFi isn't insured like her bank is. We asked ourselves the same question and decided DeFi should be much easier. So we set out to build a new kind of insurance protocol. Here's how it works. Our insurance pool covers protocols in the event of a hack. In return, protocols pay us a small fee. On the other side, stakers deposit funds into our insurance pool, and in return, they get one of the highest yields in DeFi.
00:15:38.680 - 00:16:26.810, Speaker A: And this is all made possible by our team of smart contract security experts who assess protocol risk while having their incentives aligned with stakers. Let's take a look at how this works as a new staker in our protocol. Let's say we want to deposit 10,000 die into the pool. You can see a great yield that combines the best lending protocol rates with a constant stream of insurance fees. And you can see that your money is only locked up for three days, which is the time it takes to process insurance claims. So let's stake in real time. We can see what we're earning, and we can start a withdrawal if we like, or cancel one.
00:16:26.810 - 00:17:04.272, Speaker A: Here we see any withdrawals that have passed the three day lockup. Now let's head to the allocations tab, where you can see a breakdown of the protocols we're ensuring. We think Wyron could use our help. You can also see where the Staking pool is being invested. Most of the pool is in AVV two for now, but we also wanted to show a superpower, which is being able to vote in any protocol's governance with the pool. For more on this, I'll hand it over to Evert, who will walk you through how some of these pool strategies work. I'm going to show three smart contract transactions.
00:17:04.272 - 00:17:45.300, Speaker A: So the first transaction is Staking Dai in the insurance pool, which is immediately deposited into the Die strategy. So 50 million Die gets staked. This is a stake token that gets minted, represents this die in the insurance pool. This die gets deposited into Ava. So 50 million Adai is minted. The next transaction is redeeming Adai for die, swapping it to Ava, depositing it into the strategy manager, which deposits it into the Ava strategy. As you can see here, Adai is redeemed for Dai, gets swapped via ETH to the Ava token, which is now in the Ava strategy.
00:17:45.300 - 00:18:21.412, Speaker A: So, to get the native token price, which is Dai, we use chainlink to convert the Ava price to USD. With the Ava strategy, we are able to vote on governance proposals in Ava governance. As you can see here, we submitted a vote with our voting power, which is the value of the Ava token in the Aft strategy. Thanks so much for watching. Make sure to try it out for yourself and help us get people like Alice into DeFi. Cool. Thanks, guys.
00:18:21.412 - 00:19:18.230, Speaker A: Love to hear your questions and comments. Sure. I can start because I saw already, like in the past weeks, great progress, right? Much more clear. Can you expand on the alignment between the stakers and actually in that slide where there's some people checking the contracts, which would be sort of internal? Right. Can you elaborate a little bit on the roles and where those people come from and how you incentivize them to do the right thing? Yeah, perfect. So we're going to have an internal team that works in our protocol that assesses smart contracts. So basically, smart contract experts are going to look at some of these protocols and sort of price the insurance.
00:19:18.230 - 00:20:17.256, Speaker A: And the way that we sort of align their incentives with our stakers is stakers. It's very quantitative to know what makes them happy and what makes them sad. They get happy when they get lots of insurance fees and they get sad if the pool gets hacked. So all we have to do is align the incentive compensation for that internal team with make it a function of protocol fees and also a function of losses in the pool. So that's kind of how we're thinking about aligning that internal team with the stakers who are going to put their money into the pool. Okay, so it's a sort of like reverse auditing, which is internal with a sort of ranking and a price of a risk, and then you align the stake with that sort of risk that you have assessed it correct? Exactly. So we don't think a lot of these people that want to put money into the pool are experts at assessing smart contract security.
00:20:17.256 - 00:21:13.428, Speaker A: So we want them to delegate their money to us, who are the experts, and then we can have our incentives aligned with that staking pool and we can make good decisions in terms of pricing protocol insurance. I have two questions. Maybe this is my misunderstanding from the presentation, but why is it under collateralized? I mean, what do you mean by underclateral? It sounds like it's collateralized. That's one question. The other one I'll just take that question for now. Why is it under collateralized? Second one was what's the protocol for a claim on the insurance pool? Yeah. So for the first question, why is it under collateralized? Basically under collateralization means that the amount that we cover in terms of total claims that could be paid out is higher than the amount that's in the actual pool.
00:21:13.428 - 00:22:02.324, Speaker A: And the reason that works is that's a way that traditional insurance works and they under collateralize it like 100 times. We don't think that's probably right for DeFi, but that is the way to make insurance. The cheapest for the people who need it is to make sure that pool is under collateralized so that we can get paid more fees and kind of not have to deal with perfect collateralization for everything. Because we don't think all these protocols are getting hacked at the same time for all of their TVL, if that makes sense. And then can you repeat the second question? Sorry. So let's just say someone does have a claim on the insurance poll. What's the process there? Yeah, so we're still figuring that out and we're going to start out a little bit centralized in that area and move towards a decentralized way to pay out those claims.
00:22:02.324 - 00:22:52.490, Speaker A: The problem is dealing with a protocol that was just hacked, dealing with that on chain is a little bit tricky because you don't know exactly what the extent of the hack is and how compromised that protocol is. So the claims process is going to be basically our team kind of working with that protocol to decide, okay, this is how much you lost. You can show us the transactions and then we'll pay you that amount. And basically if we don't pay out on these insurance claims, we're going to have 1020 protocols as our customers. Those customers are going to see that we don't pay out and they're going to leave. So it's kind of in our best interest to pay out so that we keep our customers and the protocol has value. That's awesome, guys.
00:22:52.490 - 00:23:10.496, Speaker A: Tons of progress on that. Thanks for doing the presentation. Much appreciated. We'll have to move on to our next team. Cool. Thanks, guys. We're really excited about it.
00:23:10.496 - 00:23:47.356, Speaker A: Team Claimable, feel free to good luck, guys. Claimable, feel free to share your video. Hey, my name is Dawson and I'm going to be showing you claimable. Claimable has exploded on the Internet in the last 48 hours because I'm helping people claim both Airdrops and pop tokens in one UI. This has been used to claim over $50,000 already and it's only been launched for 36 hours. So let's jump into it. So this is a very simple UI and I want to show you right now how much this is exploding.
00:23:47.356 - 00:24:18.204, Speaker A: I have 20 notifications because crypto Twitter is eating this up. I've gotten 500 followers in the last 36 hours because what I'm doing here is helping people get free money. So let's look at it here's. Claimable in claimable, you have a very simple, straightforward UI. All you need to do here is paste in or type in your address or ENS domain and boom, free money. Right here is a uni AirDrop worth between seven and eight grand. We have a one inch AirDrop here.
00:24:18.204 - 00:24:41.376, Speaker A: Again, you can just click, click and go claim. As mentioned, this is a one inch AirDrop, three grand. Right here is an E Two Genesis poop. Let's take a look at these. So here we are. We can claim the Poop in here, just paste in the address here's, one inch loading, loading, loading. But again, you're going to be able to claim.
00:24:41.376 - 00:24:57.844, Speaker A: When that's done, let's go ahead and jump into another address. Boom. Look at all of these. Now we've got one inch right here. Uniswap curve token. Claim right here. Again, who knows how much that's worth? You can click and check three really cool Poop tokens, proof of gucci.
00:24:57.844 - 00:25:23.276, Speaker A: That's being early in on Wi Fi. Another Wi Fi token here, COVID protocol, and especially on Poops. Even on the Poop website, you have to actually go into each and every one individually in order to claim. So for Pops alone, this is an incredible tool. But it's way more than just Poops. We're helping people find thousands of dollars they didn't know they have. Let's say I'm someone famous in the ETH scene.
00:25:23.276 - 00:26:11.152, Speaker A: What if I am Austin Griffith? Austin Griffith can paste in his ENS domain name here and boom, three claimable Airdrops and my favorite pro Op total half wrecked. That's for being part of the hack where half of the money was sent back by the hacker afterwards. So I just think that this is a really cool tool to help people be able to find the free money they have and claim it. Did you see how long that took just now to search for Half Wrecked? Searching on the claimable website itself is near instant boom. So again, even for claiming Pops, this is a better tool, but it's so much more than that. And happy to announce that you can actually subscribe now as well to future Airdrops. So subscribe if you want to find out when new Airdrops are available for you.
00:26:11.152 - 00:26:46.060, Speaker A: Again, these are Airdrops that you have to go claim. And in 2020 alone, if you were to have been an active member in DFI, you would have earned over 20,000 USD in Airdrops. So check out claimable today at Claimable Versailles. App. Let me know what you think and hop into Twitter, send me some DMs. If you want to extend this or add on other Airdrops, I'm happy to do partnerships. And if you're an early adopter here, there will be something landing soon if you sign up with your ENS domain or your address here.
00:26:46.060 - 00:27:14.630, Speaker A: So consider checking it out. Thank you for your time. All right, that was cool. Open it up for questions. I really like the claimable. I actually used it yesterday and it did find me a few things that I had missed. So yeah, kudos for that.
00:27:14.630 - 00:27:46.488, Speaker A: I'm wondering if you're already thinking how you can make money from this, or if that's not in your roadmap yet. A super question, Mariano, and thanks for trying it out. I'm really happy. Like, every time someone says they got something from it, that's the goal. And you know, when you do something like this, you think maybe you could help one person. But of course, as mentioned, I've been really pleased with the response. And yes, that email sign up.
00:27:46.488 - 00:28:26.236, Speaker A: Actually, I have over 1000 people on the list already. And in addition to, as I mentioned, giving something for free, I do plan on monetizing the subscription based service. I think there's a lot of opportunity there for both new Airdrops but potentially also recommendations. What could be creating Airdrops soon? That's the thing that a lot of us are trying to I mean, if you're really into Airdrops, it's the type of thing you kind of think ahead on. Maybe you should try using one inch. Or maybe you should try using these other things before they have their own tokens, one inch being an example that obviously already launched now. Yeah, I just tried it and it worked, so I'm really happy.
00:28:26.236 - 00:28:49.840, Speaker A: Tells me there's some uni tokens on that address I haven't used for a while. Yeah, I also like the little paper thing that falls down when it finds you something. That's really cute. I don't really have any questions. It's very simple project. I don't think there's any it seems quite obvious, anything I'd ask, so I think it's really cool. Yeah, I had a similar feedback to Mariana.
00:28:49.840 - 00:29:58.090, Speaker A: I didn't know if we could ask something like that, but since Mariana did, I'm going to double down on that. And maybe what about showing that there are some rewards, but they're actually not visible in a sense, and you can say, Look, I'll take 5% of it, or you can get actually a cat from those. Everybody would be happy to give you a share, basically, of the claims that you would give him for free to him because you found them out. And yes, more than demonetization, which is a sort of like, result of a business. Right. You called it a tool, but maybe think it like, as a product, we could have multiple extension, multiple integration, multiple partnership, multiple source of monetizations, in a sense, but good work. Very interesting.
00:29:58.090 - 00:30:28.816, Speaker A: Thank you. I appreciate the feedback on the business front as well. That is definitely an area I need to improve and shift my own mindset on. I've kind of been the open source kind of person for so long that at first it was tricky to think of monetizing any of it. But now at this point, what you're saying about making certain drops, being exclusive or maybe taking a cut on the way, it's a thing I would consider while still it's really important to me to maintain true to the community. So at the moment, there's no logging. I don't even know your addresses.
00:30:28.816 - 00:30:59.230, Speaker A: And also there's obviously no smart contracts in the middle at the moment. And so obviously stepping in as a middleman there would disrupt certain people's mindsets and ideas about this. And it's kind of like purity as an idea. True. It's also very novel, what you're doing. Right. So it's just one of the way you can shift it from tool, which is cool, to a business.
00:30:59.230 - 00:31:41.800, Speaker A: Basically just one comment I make there is what I find exciting about the cryptocurrency space, is that there could be an authority in between, but as long as it's noncustodial and you're publicly verifiable, as in you can't do anything that breaks the protocol, I don't see why people would not like that. Thanks for that input. I definitely think that this is worth experimenting on. And obviously I've been thinking on in a total of, like, 12 hours because I didn't expect this kind of response. So all of your critiques and suggestions definitely I'm taking to heart and you'll see movement on this soon. It's not one of the projects that gets stopped afterwards. I'm actually full time on it now as well, so I'm very serious about the business approach.
00:31:41.800 - 00:32:10.390, Speaker A: That's awesome. That puts us at time. Thank you very much for great presentation. There's a break coming up, so if anybody wants to go to claimable in a few minutes. All right, our next team is Polytax. You can start your demo video. Okay, here we go.
00:32:10.390 - 00:32:58.210, Speaker A: Taxes. No one likes to talk about them, but they are a fact of life. And the reality is we live in the physical world, and that physical world is usually a country where we have to pay taxes. Governments are often behind the curve when it comes to technology, but they move surprisingly fast when they sense that they're owed money. The IRS in the United States, for example, is already working with cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase to make sure that they're able to capture the taxes that they are owed from cryptocurrency trading. DFI's blockbuster year in 2020 means that it's only a matter of time before they turn their attention to DFI. Now, I'm far from a tax lawyer, but my understanding is that, yes, you do owe taxes on gains in DeFi in the same way that you owe taxes on anything else.
00:32:58.210 - 00:33:31.624, Speaker A: And before you decide to chance it and say, forget about it, keep in mind that there are real consequences to not paying your taxes, which include substantial financial penalties. In fact, there are no statute of limitations for tax evasion. And as we all know, everything in the blockchain is forever. So why take the risk? You should do what you can to report your taxes. And who knows? It's also a chance to see how well or poorly you've done as a trader. If you have losses, you might be able to deduct those. All right, so let's say that I've convinced you to pay your taxes.
00:33:31.624 - 00:34:08.680, Speaker A: You roll up your sleeves to try to figure out heads or tails from the DeFi loaning and experimenting that you've been doing. Well, I have bad news. It's not like your bank or brokerage account where you can just download a CSV file and it has all your transactions. And that makes sense if you think about it. The New York Stock Exchange isn't responsible for keeping your tax forms. So why should Uniswap or Maker or Aave keep track of that for you? So what can you do? Well, unless you've been meticulously keeping records at all the right times, it's not straightforward to just figure that out retroactively. Let me give you an example with Ave.
00:34:08.680 - 00:34:52.896, Speaker A: Let's say you deposited $1,000 worth of USDC on Ave on June 10 of last year. Well, in order to know the interest that you've earned in 2020, you need to know the Liquidity Index on January 1, 2021, at midnight, and the Liquidity Index when you first made your deposit. And even though Ave provides historical reserve parameter snapshots, there isn't one of those for those exact times. And because the interest rate is dynamic, you can only at best, estimate the balance at the year end. Now, imagine if you didn't do just one trade, went in and out of various pools at various times. You definitely need software to help you match all those trades. To figure out how much you owe, enter Polytax.
00:34:52.896 - 00:35:24.544, Speaker A: We're going to provide a network of sites to generate a simple gains and. Losses form you can feed into TurboTax or give to your accountant so they can file your taxes for you. Now let's go to a demo. The interface itself is super simple. Just enter your ID and we do the rest for you. So here you can see the gains and losses reported at the top, and we'll provide a download button for that, and below that, your actual transactions, which we use to get the data. Now let's go to another DeFi site called Polymarket, which is a betting market.
00:35:24.544 - 00:35:55.708, Speaker A: Same thing. Here you enter your wallet ID and your gains and losses are summarized for easy tax reporting. Well, it looks like I should scrap my dreams from becoming a professional trader with these returns. Well, that's it. It's nothing revolutionary like a new protocol, but we think as DeFi becomes more mainstream, infrastructure like this is going to be increasingly important. And as Ben Franklin once said, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes. All right, that is it.
00:35:55.708 - 00:37:08.464, Speaker A: And if you guys have any feedback, I'm definitely very interested in hearing what everyone has to say. Look, let me open the floor. I really like the forward looking, and I think that as humans, we have these things that we try to postpone what's needed, right, and what we know we have to face in the future. So I like the forward looking. How do you see about the integration? Or are you planning to be a standalone product and you have users coming basically to you? Or maybe you can have like a white label and have it like a service, right, and different protocols says, look, plug into it this and you see what you've done here. Have you thought about that? So the honest answer is no, we haven't really thought about it. I think right now it's just like a free tool for you to just kind of be able to see where your gains and losses are and sort of be able to just download a tax form that you can bring somewhere else.
00:37:08.464 - 00:37:56.160, Speaker A: And a lot of these features have not been built yet, so I think it's just to put it out there to see. But I think that's a great point. Maybe it makes sense to partner with an Ernest and Young or at least have an offering that you can sell to enterprises and say, hey, you guys do accounting. You don't know how to get the forms, but we'll make sure that you can use our software to get that. And yeah, I think one thing that made me think about this was I have to report my taxons coming up and I have no real way to kind of get that information to send to my accountant. So kind of how I have an idea. Nori, how far are you from a V one NVP that would be usable on a very basic DFI protocol.
00:37:56.160 - 00:38:23.310, Speaker A: So the two that I showed right now Ave and Polytax, I think they're probably about 80%. Done. I've tested them for my own use cases and some random addresses that I found, but I think a lot of it is going to be what features have I not used that need to still be incorporated and stuff like that. But again, I use it for myself, so to get at least the ones that I'm interested in. Done. Sure. Thank you.
00:38:23.310 - 00:39:00.296, Speaker A: I think it's an interesting project. Like you say in the presentation, we all have to pay our taxes, so your user base is pretty much universal. I do have one recommendation about the presentation itself. I would have liked to see 30 seconds of introduction and then three minutes and 30 seconds of the actual product. And it was the other way around. Right. We all know that taxes exist and we have to pay them.
00:39:00.296 - 00:39:21.064, Speaker A: So my recommendation would be to just quickly introduce it and then go deep into showing us the product. Got you. Yeah, that's a very fair point. Thank you. Yeah, just the other comment, I guess I learned at the end of the video not to trust you in my trading. The returns are terrible. That's just a joke.
00:39:21.064 - 00:39:47.764, Speaker A: Oh, crap. But I wanted to highlight was I think what you could do is if you hire a designer and give it a really nice user interface without right now bootstrap, you could probably work on that for, like, six months to a year and then just sell it to a company. I wouldn't even look at Ernest and Young. I would just look at the exchanges. I don't think they have very good tools for reporting DeFi protocols. Yeah, that's definitely true. Yeah.
00:39:47.764 - 00:40:18.590, Speaker A: One thing I've noticed is that I feel like a lot of exchanges don't want to show you what your results are because probably you'll stop trading if you see them. And so, yeah, it's definitely been one of my motivations. I do think they have some regulatory responsibility to help people learn how to pay their tax. So I think they have some obligations there that actually, if they just bought the software from you, they would satisfy. Got you. Cool. All right, that puts us at time.
00:40:18.590 - 00:44:05.500, Speaker A: Thanks a ton for that presentation. Thank you. It was awesome. We're going to go to a short break now. It's a three minute break. Judges, you can break away, make sure you mute your mics and just return in three minutes and we'll restart. All right, we are back.
00:44:05.500 - 00:45:10.830, Speaker A: Thank you, everyone. We'll resume in 3 seconds. All right, so our next team is Ethertree. Feel free to share your video and begin. To build the future of finance, one needs to assemble a great team, and together we created Ether Tree, which is the project that we're submitting for the hackathon. And in this video, we're going to go through some of the judges criteria. So the first one is technicality, so the problem being addressed is the diversification illusion and this is when traditional assets see their correlation increase during market crashes thus removing the benefit of diversification when it is needed most.
00:45:10.830 - 00:45:57.378, Speaker A: And it's a complex issue that is identified using archimedean copulas but the best way to think of it is having a bunch of bodyguards that then run away when danger approaches. When it comes to originality our solution was to securitize lapse risk which is negatively correlated to traditional assets and thus gives an investor's portfolio a real diversification benefit. Why? Because lapses will go up when the market crashes. Practicality now. The project is functional. We have got a smart contract, we've got a front end and we've been using quite a bit of the sponsored technology usability in order to make lapse risk more accessible. We have gamified it and there are two types of users planters and waters.
00:45:57.378 - 00:47:07.502, Speaker A: Planters take high risk and can get high returns whereas waterers take low risk and get lower returns. And to make the process easier to understand we have used a tree analogy and it goes something like this so when it comes to establishing a contract we refer to it as planting a seed. When it comes to making payments we refer to this as watering the tree and when it comes to distributing ether to the users who haven't lapsed we refer to this as harvesting the fruit the wow factor. With blockchain we can give everyone access to negatively correlated assets so that they can enjoy real diversification benefits so that their savings are protected during market crashes and we believe that this is a step in the right direction to solving the diversification illusion. But also we have made a very interesting game because what are the optimal parameters for the planter? If they're too greedy, they're going to scare off the waters. If they're too generous, they're going to end up losing ether and this is because of the various payoff structures that occur when it comes to harvesting the fruit. So Ether tree has got a bit of a dual purpose.
00:47:07.502 - 00:48:02.600, Speaker A: On the one hand, we're addressing the diversification illusion by securitizing a negatively correlated risk for better portfolio construction. But on the same hand, we're also creating a one verse many game where the optimal strategy isn't easy to determine. And we believe that this will make it therefore fun to play as players will try and beat it. But enough of me talking about Ether tree let us show you it in the demo videos. So welcome to Ether Tree and as you can see, we have one little tree in our forest and these are some of the stats behind it but we want to see what happens when we plant a tree. So we plant a tree and we come in, we input all the various parameters we click plant seed and then MetaMask is going to pop up and we're just going to confirm that we want to plant the seed. And then when we come to the forest, we can see there is our seed nicely planted in there.
00:48:02.600 - 00:48:51.690, Speaker A: So now we change our user from a planter to a water who can now come and after selecting the seed, they can come and water it and interact with the MetaMask account. And then once the transaction goes through, we can see that the tree grows. And once we get to the next payment date, we can now start to water our tree and start adding ether into the account and it's going to cause the tree to keep growing and growing. So we're just taking a little bit of time lapses so that we don't have to wait weeks until we get our tree where we can then harvest it. And this way we will get a share of what is in the smart contract, depending on what's happened with regards to lapse. Okay, good stuff. I'll probably start just be annoying.
00:48:51.690 - 00:49:59.840, Speaker A: Look, one quick feedback is I really see you want to gamify it and give some straight answer to the judgment criteria. But I would highly suggest to start with what you're building in one sentence because at least myself, I'm still guessing at the end. It seems like you create a strategy and there are different participants that can get involved with the strategy and what you could do with these strategies. But it's my guess I didn't hear like the protocol does ABC and there is EFG people that can interact doing those actions as an agent. So that's my bare feedback. It seems cool. It seems doing kind of cool stuff, but I would like to know what it is first.
00:49:59.840 - 00:50:53.534, Speaker A: So essentially it's a fund where users are coming together and they're making frequent payments. If they lapse or forget to make a payment, they get kicked out and at the end of the duration, the players that are still in so they haven't missed a payment, they then get a share of all the payments that have been made up to that date. Where we've made it. A little bit more complicated is we have added in another player called the Planter, and the Planter is the person who determines a lot of the parameters. What is the duration, what is the frequency, how much should the payment amounts be? So there is that one versus many player style. But at its core, it's essentially kind of like a savings fund where people are putting money in, but if you forget to make a payment, you've been kicked out, and the money that you've already been put in, that then gets redistributed to the people who didn't miss out on any payments. So you're just like saving money then.
00:50:53.534 - 00:51:31.846, Speaker A: In a sense it's like a big savings pot. And then if I pop up, it's used for yield protocols if you want to go farming and then you can up the money together. Yes. So one of the things that we've incorporated, is that yes, the money doesn't just sit idly in the smart contract, it will go to one of the liquidity pools and make a little bit of interest on that side as well. Essentially, yeah, it's a savings thing. So as long as you're disciplined and you're not lapsing, you should get quite a nice return. But if you do lapse and you do forget a payment, then it's quite a harsh penalty as your money is then used to provide a return or the majority of the return for the other players.
00:51:31.846 - 00:52:35.742, Speaker A: Maybe a better way to describe it is that you have this big pot of money that you want to use for yield farming. You're a farmer and you all agree to periodically top up the plant and grill the plant and you all agree to these frequent payments. And if you don't stick to the plan, to the payment plan, then you get kicked out and the rest of the farmers get the money and you don't. I don't know, I'm so confused about but I guess I can see you can force people to stick to a plan that top up your farm over time, like stuck in the plan. Where does the non correlation part that you mentioned in the presentation come up? Sorry, you're asking why with the negative correlation. So essentially what happens is most funds, they try and have a diversification benefit by going equity and bonds and then when we have a market crash like we had with COVID how we had with the oh, recession is we see both of those assets tank at the same time. And that's what a copular kind of shows.
00:52:35.742 - 00:53:21.326, Speaker A: It shows how correlation, while it might be low in the good times, it spikes in the bad times. And so what you want is a negatively correlated asset that does the opposite and this will be lapse. So the idea being here is that when the market crashes, a lot of users are going to need their money. They're going to have to reallocate it to more urgent things, which means they're going to then lapse in this game. And the people who are able to withhold that lapse and keep going, they're going to see a big benefit coming in from the smart contract. So it's kind of like the return that they're getting from the lapses is going to try offset the crash that they've experienced with their equities and bonds. Can you do it like a Ponzi scheme like FOMO 3D, where the initial payments to the seat are small, then the bigger payments are bigger maybe or something like that.
00:53:21.326 - 00:54:11.786, Speaker A: Whereas FOMO 3D was like the last one in would get the reward of the other people that they lapsed and no one submitted to the pot after a certain time period. It was gamified that way. So look, I mean, there's lots of different variations and configurations that we can have and when it was trying to decide, what should this be? We thought, let's rather gamify those parameters and put them in the planter's hands. And yes, I mean, we could even include an option that maybe in a later version where the planter can determine and say that the payments have to be stepped up. So today you're paying one ETH, tomorrow you have to pay two ETH. And there's a bit of like an exponential curve, of course, ethically, that might catch a few players out who maybe didn't understand that type of growth pattern. And that's one of the things that we like with the blockchain, is that it's transparent and it's voluntary.
00:54:11.786 - 00:54:36.630, Speaker A: And we believe that as long as you've got those two things in place, then wealth redistribution isn't as unethical as it might be in, say, other type of funds. Awesome. That puts us at time. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Awesome presentation, much appreciated. Our next team is DeFi train by protect protocol.
00:54:36.630 - 00:55:16.192, Speaker A: If you guys can start your screen share, we'll begin. Hi, everybody. I'm Corbin. And I'm Stephen. And we work on Protect Protocol, which is a new risk management protocol for DeFi. But for the market make hackathon, we build an application called DeFi Train, which makes it super easy to onboard new investors into the DeFi space. So we were inspired by the recent Wall Street bet saga with GameStop and Robinhood actually shutting off trading to all these different users.
00:55:16.192 - 00:56:08.470, Speaker A: And we wanted a super easy way to show the power of DeFi to these kind of existing investors and show them that you can't shut off trading on DeFi. Right. Lending markets are always open on DeFi. And so we kind of wanted an easy way to send an email or link to our friends to kind of show them the power of this DeFi space that we care so much about. So the way that DFI Train works is if you're an existing DFI user, you buy a new DFI user a $50 ticket to board the DFI Train. That $50 is then deposited into Ave, where it instantly starts accruing earnings and yield. So this user basically gets set up with their own kind of DFI bank account right from the get go, and they receive an email and they're kind of already a DFI user from the very start.
00:56:08.470 - 00:57:06.010, Speaker A: For your work, kind of onboarding a new user into the DFI space, you actually get to keep 20% of the interest that's accruing from this DFI ticket. The new user gets 80% of all forward looking interest, and you get to keep 25% or excuse me, 20%. So if you onboard more and more users into DFI through DFI Train, your earnings grow kind of exponentially over time. So the way the application works is very simple. First need to approve the contract to be able to move USDC on behalf of you. So we're going to confirm that with MetaMask and wait for that transaction to verify on the COVID network. You then enter in an email address for this new user so that they're going to get an email and they're going to see the $50 that's been deposited into Ave on their behalf and they're going to be able to see the interest that they're earning over time.
00:57:06.010 - 00:57:53.320, Speaker A: For this demo, I'm actually using Steven's email address, so I'm actually buying a ticket to the DFI train and then sending it to Steven's email address and he's going to show you what that looks like when this new potential DeFi user receives that in their inbox. So congratulations, you just onboarded a new user into DeFi. So Stephen, why don't you show them what they get? Perfect. Thanks Corbin. So from the perspective of a new DeFi user here, I get a ticket to join the DeFi train. And as we can see in the email, we get a quick introduction on what DeFi is for a user who might not know, we let them know their funds have been deposited into Aave where they're already earning more interest in their bank. And we've also set them up a wallet with a public and a private key listed.
00:57:53.320 - 00:58:29.848, Speaker A: From here we can go into our earnings and we'll see the DeFi train earnings page. And you can see the DeFi train is pulled into the station here. And we can see your earnings ticking up in Aave. From here, we give a quick explanation on how it works along with a quick guide for newer users who might not be as familiar with DeFi. On the quick guide, we give a quick overview of what DeFi is because we all know it's really hard to explain to new users. And we also give instructions on how to set up a MetaMask wallet along with showing some of our favorite protocols like Ave and Uniswap. That's all from Ozarkotect.
00:58:29.848 - 00:59:20.072, Speaker A: Thanks very much. Thanks all, bye. I have a couple of things. First, it is interesting to try to get more people into DeFi, I would say. One, try to not send a private key via email. It's like a big no no. And the other thing is, have you checked gas prices for when using Ave on main net? My worry is that two transactions to deposit 50 USDC is probably going to eat up either the whole thing in gas fees or even more.
00:59:20.072 - 01:00:07.824, Speaker A: And I don't know if you've thought about maybe pooling those funds and depositing maybe once a day for multiple users or something of the sorts. Yeah. Thanks, Mariano. Very two very good points and two things that we've definitely been thinking about. So on the private key in the email, obviously is generally a very bad thing to do. On our onboarding guide, we actually explain how to set up a new MetaMask wallet and how you can also transfer your funds from this burner wallet that we've created on behalf of you to the new wallet. Right, so you actually get fresh security when you're kind of like when a new user is becoming an active user and actually becoming an active participant via MetaMask wallet.
01:00:07.824 - 01:00:44.560, Speaker A: So that's the first for the second one. Yes. So gas prices definitely hurt us here. Steven and I wanted an easy product that we could send to our friends that work at banks and just have them kind of get into DFI right away. Gas is a huge barrier there, which is why we actually encoded that interesting logic in the token where the sender who's actually paying the gas earns 20% of that interest going forward. Right. So assuming that my new user is going to keep their deposit in Ave for a while, I'll actually be accruing interest that will help cover the gas costs that I'm paying upfront to onboard that new user.
01:00:44.560 - 01:01:27.884, Speaker A: I think this would be one of the good examples for the roll apps where the user has some funds on a roll up provider. Not going to name any to be independent. And then you could pull the funds on the roll up and transfer them all to Aviv once a day or something so you can amortize that cost. That'd be really cool because then setting this up, it only causes a fraction of the cost. Yeah, I totally agree. One of the reasons we used Burner wallets was that trade off between usability and security, but especially roll ups once they're more mature. This is a great case because it's a low ticket amount, and then they can move that to mainnet if they become a more active user.
01:01:27.884 - 01:02:10.264, Speaker A: Totally agree. Other than that, I'm always happy to see more projects that focus on onboarding new people to DeFi. And I think I really like the UI and the progression from having a Savvy user invite a non Savvy user to this space. So yeah, congratulations. I hope that you continue building on it. Thanks, guys. Thanks for the great feedback.
01:02:10.264 - 01:02:27.520, Speaker A: Yeah. If we win a prize, then we'll use those earnings to push domain, so appreciate it. Yeah, thank you. Thanks very much. All right, thanks, guys. That was great. Our next team is Team Malice.
01:02:27.520 - 01:02:48.104, Speaker A: Please share and start your video. Okay, sure. And right. The volume is pretty low. Have you shared audio? On the bottom left. Sorry, let me double check. Let me stop.
01:02:48.104 - 01:02:59.928, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, you have to stop here. Sure. Audio. Okay. Okay. Hi.
01:02:59.928 - 01:03:29.044, Speaker A: We created a simple application for users to be able to spend die and get 7% cash back. Let's walk through how the application actually works. So in step one, Peter runs a hot dog stand and decides to deploy a store from his mobile wallet. Peter deposits $100 worth of die into the store to stake. Peter does not want to give a discount. To attract customers, peter will stake $70 worth of die instead. Users will spend $1,000 worth of die at Peter's business.
01:03:29.044 - 01:04:04.240, Speaker A: They will receive $70 MDI which is wrapped die. Peter $70 worth of die would be locked as collateral. Peter needs the collateral locked up. Peter will accept $70 worth of MDI to unlock his collateral. In scenario six, Alice is running store B and is selling NFDS. She has $100 worth of collateral in her store. Users will spend $70 worth of MDA at our store, $70 would remain as collateral and $30 would remain as collateral and $70 added to our balance.
01:04:04.240 - 01:04:38.828, Speaker A: In step seven, business is extremely bad for Peter because of a hurricane. Alice decides to place $70 worth of die as collateral relief to the open market at a rate at 30%. Peter makes a trade and loses 21 die and gains $49 to his balance. Alice will gain $21 to her balance and $70 locked up as collateral. And that's how the application is supposed to work in theory. Let's go to the application. So this part of the UI is not finished yet.
01:04:38.828 - 01:05:10.820, Speaker A: This is where I would be able to filter for stores based on location and what type of store that suits my. So let's say I'm Peter and I want to deploy a store. This is the default store. We don't have access to that, so we need to deploy our own store. This is currently running on Robston, so there might be a slight time delay. And this test version is using Ether instead of Dai. So I just deployed a store.
01:05:10.820 - 01:05:56.980, Speaker A: It should appear in a few seconds. And there it is. And I want to send, let's say, one Ether to this store that I just deployed. I just copied the address. So I'm going to send let me paste the store address and I am going to send one ETH to that store. And I just send one Ether and just wait for confirmation that the Ether is in the store. Should be there in a few seconds.
01:05:56.980 - 01:06:40.640, Speaker A: Here it is. So we have one Ether in our store and let's stake, let's say, 50% of that amount of Ether. So I'm going to stake 50% of that amount of Ether confirm. So this is basically the general idea of it. And once I have my stake now I would be able to spend to make payments and the amount that I have staked would be lacked as collateral. So there it is. There's our stake now in our store.
01:06:40.640 - 01:07:25.170, Speaker A: And this is the general process of how this application would actually work. All right, and that should be it. Hello, Warren. We looked at this for, I think, at least half an hour every session in the past two weeks. So I will not had anything. A lot of progress and a lot of more clarity, but I see there is so much thinking behind. But I'll let the other judges ask you question and dig more on what you actually build.
01:07:25.170 - 01:08:07.256, Speaker A: Yeah, I have one clear equipment, one simple ClarissaN is I go to the store, I deposit one e, I lock off 50% as collateral. So I say ten die, I lock off collateral. So correction. So this test version that I'm running on Robson right now, it's using Ether. I'm going to switch it over to Dai, right? So say for example, you're selling NFTs, and this could work at any level. Even if you're not a business, you could still deploy a store, and normally you would want to give a discount on your goods and services to attract customers. But you don't have to do that in this case, right? What you could do is stake die.
01:08:07.256 - 01:10:08.150, Speaker A: And based on the amount of die that you have staked, when users make a payment, if there's enough stake to give 7% of that user's payment, right? What's going to happen is that amount of stake is going to be locked as collateral, meaning you can't touch it, right? And the users will actually receive MDI, right? Now, MDI is the only thing that could be spent back to unlock your collateral, right? Whenever you're ready in the future, right? MDI could also be spent at any other store that anybody else deployed, whether they're selling NFTs, whether it's a restaurant, whatever it is, right? But as a store, I receive a payment and then it gets locked up. So you receive your part of the payment, right? You receive your amount and the amount that you have staked, right? That 7% portion. So you're going to receive the full amount that the user paid you with, right? And so the scenario, let's say I spend $1,000, right? You're going to receive that $1,000, right? If you have $70 word of die stake, right? That's going to be locked as collateral, meaning you're still going to receive your $1,000, right? And that collateral now you can't touch it. The only thing that could unlock it is if any user comes back in the future and spend MDI to unlock it. Or if you decide to sell that collateral at a loss to a different store, that's the only way it could be unlocked. So is the idea then, as you come to my store, you buy something, you get back some MMdi because you're a customer, then it just encourages you to come back and buy something else. So I can get my collateral back.
01:10:08.150 - 01:11:43.040, Speaker A: So it's not only your store. So it's like anybody that deploys a store, whether they're selling NFT, whatever type of store, or whatever you're selling, whether it's just hot dogs or ice cream on the street, all you have to do is just stake die, right? I spend, I receive MDI, and the die that you stake is locked as collateral, right? And whenever there might be some unseen event where you might need that collateral, right? You could sell it or you could decide that, hey, I want to accept back MDI to unlock my collateral, okay? I don't want to take up the time. Mariano, do you have a. Question. I have to say that I'm having a hard time understanding the project. If you could summarize this in a couple of lines. Would you say that you're building almost like an internal economy for a set of businesses, or how would you classify this? So basically, the main idea behind this is for anybody within the crypto space, you're able to spend die and receive cash back on that die without using a card service.
01:11:43.040 - 01:12:08.410, Speaker A: Usually you would have to use a card service, such as some debit card or whatever. Right. And that requires you to trust that central service to put your dai on to receive that cash back. Right. In this case, I'm able to spend die from my mobile wallet and still receive cash back peer to peer without actually trusting a central service to actually do that for me. And that 10% is coming from the collateral that the merchants have locked up. Exactly.
01:12:08.410 - 01:12:27.920, Speaker A: So the more merchants come on. Right. And you as a merchant, you would want to do this because you don't necessarily want to give a discount because there might be some scenario in the future where I gave the example where there's a hurricane. Right. And Peter can't do business. You might need that collateral. Right.
01:12:27.920 - 01:12:53.272, Speaker A: And then in that case, you're able to sell that collateral at a loss to another store. Right. Okay. All right, that puts us at time. Thanks for putting that together. Good luck with the hack moving forward, and appreciate it. I'm going to work out our next team.
01:12:53.272 - 01:13:22.836, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm going to try to look at the slide again because it is interesting. Our next team is the creative platform. Start your share. Hey, guys. How's it going? I just want to make sure we get screen. Is the screen available? Everybody can see the screen? I can't see yes.
01:13:22.836 - 01:15:43.584, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Do I need let me just make sure I got the audio. Yeah. Okay. Sam. Sam Sau with the creative platform. So I want to run over what we have inside of this app.
01:15:43.584 - 01:16:12.632, Speaker A: So far. We have the CRTV token contract that generates our tokens, that feeds into the vendor contract, which buys and sells our tokens, acts like a vending machine. We've got some Aave protocols in here. We've got lending pool, got staking. We have governance and credit delegation. Then on the dashboard, we take out Lewis Pierce's dashboard. He's got a vending machine here.
01:16:12.632 - 01:16:41.244, Speaker A: This is the creator dashboard. He's got a vending machine to swap tokens. Lewis has the ability to create liquidity pools, and he's using one for tour. He's got one for album, a music video, and features. You can only get these perks as you level up throughout the platform through certain metrics. He has a list of tokens that he likes to keep up with, and he's got his revenue. Here his revenue stream.
01:16:41.244 - 01:17:19.890, Speaker A: He's got NFTs. He can keep track of his tickets and his brand revenue. This is a list of pools. We've got, for instance, Coca Cola, Nike, Samsung, netflix. If he was writing for TV shows or writing for film and could put together a pilot or a trailer that would be where he would submit to this pool. We have a list of all those different pools and when they pretty much so that's pretty much the creative platform. And look forward to talking to you guys soon.
01:17:19.890 - 01:18:03.070, Speaker A: Sure. I have two feedbacks. One is that the Beat made me realize I've not been partying for maybe 20. That's the first feedback. The second one jokes parties. Who are the participants here just to make sure who would come to the platform and who are the different agents involved in this. Sure.
01:18:03.070 - 01:18:35.172, Speaker A: Right now, so I've been in the music industry now for about 19 years in my life. I've had big deals with Interscope, so I have a lot of I know everyone from Jimmy Ivine to Dr. Dre to Timbaland. So that's me. I got a lot of different friends that I've already kind of talked to briefly on it that own businesses for one of my close friends is a multi Grammy winning songwriter. Everyone from J Lo to Janet Jackson. But she has a new digital label platform for creatives.
01:18:35.172 - 01:18:57.212, Speaker A: She has access. She just started last year. But she has over 2000 independent creators at her disposal at the moment. That's growing every day. But we're looking to kind of onboard creatives from that aspect. I also went to a creative school. I went to full cell university in Winter Park, Florida.
01:18:57.212 - 01:19:40.008, Speaker A: And I also have outlets for that. From the college aspect, maybe colleges like Juilliard or colleges like I've gone to where we can onboard creatives from there as well. So as far as the creative space, that part I feel like we have kind of taken care of from the initial onboard. On the other side, on the brand side, I have some relationships with a few CEOs. Like, Bretling Watches is one of the people I've reached out to in regards to jump in quickly. I guess for me, it's more who are the agents in the protocols? You have creatives, you have users. How are they interacting? Is like the users depositing to the creatives.
01:19:40.008 - 01:19:56.316, Speaker A: What's that sort of abstract relationship. Sure. So brands create a campaign. Brands need commercials, they need advertising, all that good stuff. So they create that campaign for whatever that is. The creative comes. They stake that initial liquidity into that pool.
01:19:56.316 - 01:20:29.164, Speaker A: The submissions come in from the creatives. They stake their submissions via their tokens. And now we got a whole bunch of they could do as many submissions as they like. And there's a deadline, obviously, for that to end. Fans can stake into that liquidity pool to vote for the sake of voting. It's basically, in a short form, American Idol. In real life, they can follow their favorite artists, keep up with them, invest into their artists vote for their artists and all that comes together with as well.
01:20:29.164 - 01:20:55.888, Speaker A: It's like you're paying towards your artists and you lock up collateral and they're earning interest on this. Correct. The other thing is with the liquidity pools, when you're submitting to a brand, you're really just looking for that interest. The interest that comes from that liquidity pool is going to whoever the winner is from that governance. I don't know about brands, so to say, so to speak. I'm not sure yet. But the thought is everyone can get their money from that liquidity pool.
01:20:55.888 - 01:21:14.168, Speaker A: The winner gets the earnings from the interest, and we keep it moving. That way nobody feels like a loss, and we keep going. Okay. It's a static pool together as well. Yeah, exactly. Brands can stake into creators liquidity pools. There's metrics involved though.
01:21:14.168 - 01:22:01.848, Speaker A: So as you go through the process of the platform, you have reputation based from reputation with the brands, you have fan engagement and you have platform engagement metrics and whatnot. So as you level up throughout the platform, you would then unlock certain perks. For instance, having your own liquidity pool. I want to do a tour. All right, now I'm a level whatever, and I can create a liquidity pool for my fans to stake into, and then I can do a governance within that liquidity pool. Hey, I want to do like 60 cities. What cities should I go to? Let's vote, you know what I'm saying? Like more interactivity into getting your creator to whatever level.
01:22:01.848 - 01:22:29.350, Speaker A: And it's not just music. It's also digital art. I'm working on an NFT session section of it right now in East Denver. And then also if you're writing movies or if you're writing TV shows, pilots, right, that goes to Hulu or Netflix all day. They always need that type of stuff. So just thinking of it in a sense, know directly to them, no middlemen, no labels, none of that. Just no managers, nothing.
01:22:29.350 - 01:22:48.294, Speaker A: That's cool. We usually tell people don't to put so much music in the presentation, but that worked. Thank you. It was mine. I created it. Oh, awesome. Yeah, that's somewhat in a real world example too, how that would work.
01:22:48.294 - 01:23:08.800, Speaker A: Like me being a creator. We need a commercial boom. You know what I'm saying? Well, cool. That puts us at time. We're going to do one more team before the break. Our next team is Matic Crosschain arbitrage opportunity graph. If you could start your demo video.
01:23:08.800 - 01:23:45.914, Speaker A: Yes. Hey, guys, can you see the yeah, yeah, it was super boring name. So Trent suggested this nice name for Cat. So let's start. Hi. I'd like to present Cat Cross Chain Arbitrage Toolkit. The opportunity I'd like to present through this tool is the high gas on Ethereum One.
01:23:45.914 - 01:24:33.400, Speaker A: Now, it's very difficult to do anything, even yield farming. So many projects started incentivized liquidity mining opportunity in other chains such as Matic and XDI. That shift of crossing coins to different chain increased the arbitrage opportunities. However, currently it's very hard to visualize where these opportunities sit. So this is what I'm trying to solve with my toolkit crosschain arbitrage toolkit size sh you can just play around but let me try to demo. So what it's going to do is visualize in the historical token prices between main net matic and simulate profit margins at a different price points. So, let's see how it goes.
01:24:33.400 - 01:25:42.314, Speaker A: So, if you click this, you can see the list of tokens listed on Quickswap which is one of the uniswap clone in the Matic side chain and sorted by the volume size. So it has more liquidity. So for example ghost token used for Ave Gotchi you start looking into the daily price, average price of both uniswap and Quickswap which is going to take a bit. Yeah, but what it's going to show is the price of the main net and Matic and it shows that there's a currently it's slightly cheaper in Matic like for example -3% difference and you can also see the volume difference and all that stuff. So let's try to see better opportunities. Easy token is you will see 12% difference. So mania is a lot cheaper.
01:25:42.314 - 01:27:10.558, Speaker A: So this is a chance to send some USDC to you exchange USDC to easy on main net transit to Matic and then you change it back to USDC. And if you go like something like 1000 pound with two intervals and if you get by the way, this one is a daily average but most of the arbitrage opportunity window is very slim. So this is where getting the live quotes with a different price point really shines. So if you do get quotes, it's getting a quote, it actually checks the quotes from one inch and quick swap. So this one is interesting that if you transfer 500 watts of USDC you actually get $38 but if you do more than that, you actually lose more, you lose money basically. That's basically it. And I just wanted to show you that integration matic and using graph for the token mapping and also I use to get the token address of which is the Matic version of Ausdclai.
01:27:10.558 - 01:27:53.878, Speaker A: That's it. Thank you. Hey Makoto. Hey. So in this case, you have the arbitrage toolkit and it is showing pricing opportunities. Right. Is this something that you could extend, for example already having USDC on both on Mainnet, on Maddox and on XDI and taking data from this and start making trades based on how much money you have in each.
01:27:53.878 - 01:29:03.034, Speaker A: And is this where you want to take this? Yeah. So idea is like having USDC on both net and this graph shows from both direction like Ethereum to Matic and Matic and ethereum so that you can do it either direction. But having said that, when I was making it, I think $30 made a bit of profit. But now even crossing bridge and exchanging is more expensive. So now I'm kind of thinking towards going between layer two, like Xdai, Honeyswap and Quickswap or basically Honeyswap and the Quickswap have a similar volume, about five, 6 million liquidity. But if you also go for the finance chain, I think it's 20 million or something, a pancake swap, they have like 20 million. I didn't create this time, but I think the natural opportunity is looking into something like a connect, which does a layer two swapping.
01:29:03.034 - 01:29:51.578, Speaker A: And also the Ethereum team announced a hop exchange, which does the kind of identity between layer two. So I think real opportunity is like crossing between our two. But this I think nice thing is everybody uses uniswap. So all the tools that I'm building is, I'm hoping, easily adaptable. I think there's another one, Honey Harmony one, they also have whatever swap. And how easy would it be to integrate, for example, with loop ring? I don't know which I mean, they have their own AMM, but it's probably not EVM based in theory, it should be easy now. So there's two constraints.
01:29:51.578 - 01:30:50.814, Speaker A: If you want to have the broader view, you want to have the subgraph to draw the daily graph so that constraint restraint like Xdai has it, Matic didn't have it, but the team of the Quickswap, they actually indexed by themselves. So some of the chains, like Binance chain subgraphs, don't have it. But I learned that I can just index by myself so fast, I do that and after that, one thing it's good is I don't really have to deploy my own smart contract. It's just a matter of calling the function. So if I want to do with loop ring, if loop ring has any sort of API, all I need is just get the quotes and the swap. But I think low hanging fruits is going for EBM one because I can just use most of the uniswap one. But in theory I can do anywhere.
01:30:50.814 - 01:31:24.506, Speaker A: It's just like sell and buy. Cool. Very interesting. Yeah, very interesting. How far are you from, say, something usable for the users, final users? How it's the timeline. So this visualize part of the main net and testnet, you can use it. I already deployed it, so you can play around to see the opportunity.
01:31:24.506 - 01:32:05.354, Speaker A: And if there is a big opportunity, you can already do it manually. But this is currently a visualizer. So to cross it and all the stuff, you just have to do it manually. Actually doing as a bot, I'm kind of hackathon driven guy, so there's a bunch of hackathons happening. So whenever there's a price and many chains have a yeah, I think Binance has a hackathon this month, so I might do it if they have some price. And the thing is, I don't have to do it for price because once I build it, I just start using by myself. Got it.
01:32:05.354 - 01:32:31.314, Speaker A: All right, that puts us at time. Thank you very much. Thank you, guys. We're going to go into a ten minute break now. We'll come back at half past the hour. I don't know what time zone everyone is in, but at 230 Eastern US in ten minutes. Remind the judges you can turn off your mics and your cameras for this break and just return in ten minutes.
01:32:31.314 - 01:33:32.840, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone. See you. Thanks. All right, I'm realizing now that I think my screen was showing during the break. Sorry about that. Hope it wasn't anything crazy. All right, we'll just take a minute till everybody's back.
01:33:32.840 - 01:34:20.646, Speaker A: All right, and we are back. Thanks, everyone. Our next team ready to present is dear Flash Loan Protocol. Start your screen share and we'll begin. Hi, everyone. Can you all see the screen? Yeah, we can. About the slides, can you see the slides? Yes.
01:34:20.646 - 01:35:01.022, Speaker A: Cool. Okay, let's get started. So today I'm going to introduce a protocol we built called Dear Protocol, which is a permissionless Flash loan marketplace. We all know that Flash loans are quite powerful. It can be used in a lot of use cases. However, the current Flash loan is quite inefficient for several reasons. One is that as you can see, most assets and tokens are sitting in users'wallets without usage right now because those token holders are not willing to provide liquidity on uniswap because of this impermanent loss.
01:35:01.022 - 01:35:40.394, Speaker A: And besides of this, there's no other way to generate passive income for those tokens lending protocol like Ave are limited for only a few small sets of mainstream tokens. And that's why we introduced Dear Flashloan protocol. Our goal is to make Flashloan available for all tokens. And there are four core features we want to achieve. One is like uniswap. It's a permission list to create any pool for any tokens. Second is low fee so that anyone can use the Flashloan in practical usage.
01:35:40.394 - 01:36:37.170, Speaker A: Third is there's no impermanent loss by providing liquidity on our protocol. And lastly, we can create generate passive income for all unused tokens. So let me show you how. The product we built to achieve all those goals, it's on coven. So on our interface that we adopt from uniswap, you can provide liquidity easily. For example, here you can provide liquidity for uni, right, by simply click and then confirm on the transaction. If you're willing, you can also remove liquidity with your original token plus the fee generated by any Flash long usage.
01:36:37.170 - 01:37:28.146, Speaker A: Also, like, we have created demo token here. And then I can show you to create a new pool with this new token that's not existing on our protocol. So here, let's say we provide like 10,000 token in the pool. After approved this token, we can supply it quite straightforward. Let's wait a little bit. Okay? Yeah. Now you can supply so when you supply this, any developer who want to borrow this as a flashlong collateral, they can do it.
01:37:28.146 - 01:38:09.630, Speaker A: Now let me show you. Like as a developer, how can you execute a Flashlong. So we build a simple interface like Uniswap again, so that they can execute. So look, my balance is five Ether. How can I execute, say, 100 Ether flash long. So, simply put, the amount you want to borrow from our pool. And second, you need to provide a smart contract that you write for the Flashlong, right? So I've prepared a demo one, you can also add data here, but it's optional.
01:38:09.630 - 01:39:09.038, Speaker A: Now, if you are a developer, yeah, you can create this, execute this platform and that's done. That's all very easy. To better visualize the performance and the detailed statistics information of our protocol, we've also used the graph and modified from the Uniswap info code base and build this so that you can easily see that those pools we create liquidity volume. And also like here, we've add some demo token we've executed on Ether, we add a liquidity on Uni, et cetera. So, quite straightforward, so that's it comparing to other competitors. So our fee is low, we have unlimited choice like Uniswap. There's no impermanent loss like Uniswap.
01:39:09.038 - 01:39:40.990, Speaker A: And so that is a guaranteed profitable at least you don't lose anything. Lastly, it's permissionless. So here, I'm not saying ave is not permissionless, just listing a new asset on a protocol is permissionless. Like Uniswap. You don't have to go through the governance. And what's more, we actually launched this protocol on Minnesota and providing the liquidity on Minnets. It's already ongoing and we're going to introduce and announce this shortly.
01:39:40.990 - 01:40:24.906, Speaker A: And then that's some information about me and thanks. I have a question. So the smart contract that you input for the Flash loan, does it have to conform to, I think it's 31 56, the EIP standard for Flash loans? Or how does that work? You don't have to have that. Actually, it's quite straightforward. It's like uniswap. So each pool, it's a token, it's an ERC 20 token. Yeah.
01:40:24.906 - 01:41:44.938, Speaker A: So that when you deposit provide liquidity, you get a D token on our unit, just like Uni LP token, right? And then when you withdraw, you burn that LP token, D token and then you get an original token plus the fee we extend from this smart contract to have a method called Flash loan. And then that Flash loan basically allows you to execute a Flash loan as long as you guarantee to pay the original collateral plus fee. That's where everyone's into my question. So in your example, you hit the Flash loan button and you send a transaction for a Flash loan. But Flash loans are only for single transactions, aren't they? What are using the Flash loan for? Using it the trade in Uniswap, when you had Flash loan, what are you using the loan for? Yeah, probably is too quick, but this address is actually a smart contract that's having logic about doing upcharge, for example. So underneath it requires to borrow some Flash loan. So you can just provide this address and then yeah, so all the logics in the contract, let's just say I want to do like, I don't know, the contract takes care of all the trading logic.
01:41:44.938 - 01:42:09.694, Speaker A: And when I hit Flash, I'm just applying the ETH that I need in order to execute the Dai transfer. Exactly. If you read the code here quickly. So, yeah, basically underneath it calls a Flash long and skewed the logic. But it's quite dumb here. We just call the Flash loan and then pay back the necessary fee. We don't do anything.
01:42:09.694 - 01:43:15.706, Speaker A: Yeah, I have another question for me. Flash loans seem like something used by bots that you'd write a script and using Flash and you find an opportunity. Does it make sense to use them at a user interface level? Oh, yeah. So to be clarified, we built this interface just to be easy to use for anyone who have existed, smart contract and need to execute manually. If you have bots, yeah, you should actually use our smart contract and call directly, and we have a document to show the details. And besides of that, you can come to this info page, click on each pool, you got a smart contract information, and then you can browse those methods through the ether scan and then just integrate it. Yeah, I saw it a couple of times last week, was impressed.
01:43:15.706 - 01:44:04.606, Speaker A: It's a strong use case. But now that I see the full presentation and the full pitch, I would suggest you to give a you give up a broad overview of all the possible things that you could do it. But I would also suggest to take one direction and build a product for one strong use case and build that sort of niche and grow from there. Otherwise it's a little bit scattered. Also for the users. Right. Many use cases or different things, and you can use these, this, that, but when it's one simple idea, it's better to focus on that and grow that mass and then move maybe to different things.
01:44:04.606 - 01:44:26.770, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for the feedback for now. Yeah, it's protocol that's just for the general purpose and eventually we need to demo in the specific use case. Thanks. Right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Flash loan protocol.
01:44:26.770 - 01:45:34.666, Speaker A: Our next project is Uma, one inch synth. If you can start your screen share and begin. So for the hackathon, I have deployed an EMP contract from Uma that allows you to mint synthetic U one inch tokens using we as collateral. So U one inch will follow the price of one inch USD. So for example, here in Coin Gecko, this is the ratio, and in Unisoft, this is the ratio of the synthetic token. So as you can see here, you need we. And I've already approved all these, and I have also copied the addresses, so you can see the balance of all my addresses.
01:45:34.666 - 01:45:58.870, Speaker A: So right now you have one we. So let's try to mint tokens. So as you can see, it's 100 minimum tokens to mint. So let's try to mint like 150 maybe. So as you can see here, this is the amount of collateral that you need to use. So let's put in like 0.5. So let's try to mint.
01:45:58.870 - 01:47:10.960, Speaker A: So after you mint, you can also deposit and withdraw your collaterals accordingly and also redeeming, which is you can remove some of your position so that you can reduce your debt, basically. So as you can see right now, you have 150 of the tokens, which you can see right here as well. 150. What you can do now with the tokens is you can either short or long. So to long the token on uniswap, you need to buy the tokens from uniswap or you can also short. So since the price of the synthetic token is way higher in unisop than in the natural one inch token, you want to short the token, basically. So you want to mint the tokens from this page and then you sell it on uniswap and hope that the price of UNH goes down in the future.
01:47:10.960 - 01:48:17.050, Speaker A: And this is the bonus. I guess you can also deposit some we two A, so we have 0.5, so let's deposit zero point 25 deposit deposited. So yeah, that's about it. Thank you. Quick feedback then I'll leave the floor to Patrick and Mariano, the UI as a general suggestion, the user the least options. You give it to him, the easier it gets and it drive the traction and simplicity.
01:48:17.050 - 01:49:14.150, Speaker A: I have a feeling of getting lost as soon as I see the page. They're not like steps, it's all in one place. So maybe you could give the user less choices and maybe step by step. And then the second feedback would be the use case. Seems a little bit narrow. Maybe you can make it a little bit more general with more tokens and more applications. Why you choose just one specific token to shorten and simply too long and short, right? It's just for that functionality, correct? Yeah, I made it so that it's only for that functionality because it's in one of the hackathons like prizes.
01:49:14.150 - 01:49:56.924, Speaker A: So I just follow okay, I can chip in it. Yeah. I mean, I found that user interface a little bit confusing myself. I think that's why I'm struggling a bit. But my understanding is that you're creating synthetic assets and you're printing these one inch tokens. I guess one thing I would like to clarify is how does that mean they're long or short? I just got the impression you're printing one inch tokens. It's through the uma protocol.
01:49:56.924 - 01:50:44.680, Speaker A: So it's different from just trading from uniswap. So the price may be different, but there's very little use case. The only use case for this syntax tokens is if there's an arbitrage opportunity between maybe uniswap and sushi or something. But are you just basically creating a representation of that token? It's not like you're representing a strategy. Okay, so is it just a token then? Yes. Cool. Yeah, I don't really have any more feedback.
01:50:44.680 - 01:51:38.650, Speaker A: I think it's interesting. Me personally, I kind of like the UIs where I can see absolutely everything, maybe hide that under a pro tab and give normal users less information, but I personally enjoy seeing everything in one clear window. Yeah. I've got one last question. Did you guys know about synthetic assets before you started or is it something new to you guys? You've been learning what a synthetic asset is. I mean, I actually just learned it like a month ago, so I just learned what Uma was a month ago as well. So I was completely new to, uma Basically, I've never used Uma, so it looks pretty cool.
01:51:38.650 - 01:51:59.490, Speaker A: Well, awesome. That just about puts us at time. Thank you very much. Uma, one inch synth. Thank you. Moving on to the next project, we have Quadratic Treasury. Hello, guys.
01:51:59.490 - 01:52:28.440, Speaker A: Start your presentation. So this is Alex 1 second. Let me share my screen. Can you see my screen? Yes. All right. Hello everyone. This is Alex from Italy and I'm the team lead of Q Two T, a continuous permissionless and milestone based approach to quadratic funding for the projects in the area of public goods.
01:52:28.440 - 01:53:39.040, Speaker A: Now, quadratic funding was ideated to be the mathematically optimal way to allocate funds for the public goods, and we've seen projects like Gitcoin experimenting with it, bringing a whooping $1 million plus in funding to support open source projects. This model is certainly efficient till a certain degree. Unfortunately though, with the increase in project and funds, it proved to be impractical. Being exposed to civil attacks to manipulate the matching pool and starting to become more and more of a popularity game that rewarded projects that were more active on the social media rather than the ones in most active development. The Quadratic Treasury model solves these issues with unique universal identities and a two step quadratic distribution that replaces small contributions by individual contributors and matches available funds based on the milestones achieved by each active project in a Dao. Hey, I'm yevgeny. I was smart contracting this project and I will do a quick walkthrough of contracts, organization, and Dao integration.
01:53:39.040 - 01:54:39.090, Speaker A: There are three templates, each represented by Treasury Dao contract. Each template can have multiple communities. Each community consists of community treasury, community contract, the Ito Token and Gigs registry. Most of Ava integration is done through Treasury Dao contract. It uses Ava to deposit funds to get yield on them. When one of the communities completes enough milestones, dao quadratically calculates allocation for each community and delegates Dao borrowing power to corresponding community Treasuries contract. Our system combines ave native credit delegation for the financial aspect with distributed town's mutual credit network that scores dow's actual activity and milestone and integrates chain link decentralized oracles to validate the milestones themselves.
01:54:39.090 - 01:55:04.590, Speaker A: Hello. I'm Milena and I'm the backend lead of the Q two. T team. Since milestones are such an integral part of our quadratic distribution process, we need to make sure that the data management is robust. For this reason, milestones are efficiently validated peer to peer and off chain. After that, our system verifies them one by one through a decentralized Oracle integration with Chainlink. I will walk you through that.
01:55:04.590 - 01:55:48.312, Speaker A: Now, when a milestone is created, the serialtown generates a unique hash for it and sends it to the gig validator smart contract. At this point, true to our integration with Chainlink, the smart contract calls the backend for milestone verification. Once the hash is validated, the request fulfilled event gets emitted and this triggers the fulfilled function. This sets the validation result. During this act, we already implemented our smart contracts, deployed them on Covenantestnet and verified them on Etherscan. We also released a fully functional prototype. And here, for example, I show you how.
01:55:48.312 - 01:56:45.688, Speaker A: In two easy steps, I can choose the template to donate in either open source art and events or local projects and delegate 30 coven dies, customizing the delegation agreement here we approve the deposit, then we sign the transaction and in few seconds we can verify on Etherscan that the delegation actually went through. So, thank you very much for listening to me. This was q two t the quadratic treasury team. And we are building a new permissionless standard for any project to integrate and reuse and for anyone to donate to and fundraise for the public goods. Feel free to join us. Hello, I'm back. So guys, thank you for listening to us.
01:56:45.688 - 01:57:26.644, Speaker A: Any comment, question, feedback? Yeah, I could jump right in. So you sort of highlight the issue with Gitcoin grants as identity. People are creating Siebels and just making fake accounts, but I didn't really see any solution to the Siebel problem. In your presentation. Samsung is wondering, what's the connection there? How do you solve that? Or do you solve it? Maybe you don't. Yeah, well, I mentioned it very briefly in the connection with Distributed Town. Basically, Distributed Town has a mutual credit network that is integrated with identity layer.
01:57:26.644 - 01:58:09.380, Speaker A: So identities are completely pseudonymous, 100%. We don't request any kind of data and they are tight on skills. So in order to complete a gig, acquire credits and let's say, grow the score of your own community and satisfy milestones for your project, you need to have a unique identity. And it's non viable to have multiple ones because you need to validate your skills one by one. It's a sort of subtractive model. So basically, we assume by default that what you state initially, what you claim is 100% true. And anytime you receive a peer to peer validation that we verify with Chainlink later on on Chain, then your score can either be confirmed or decreased.
01:58:09.380 - 01:58:36.848, Speaker A: Okay, so it's sort of like you mentioned credit networks. It was like proof of a human worker along those lines. Proof of contribution? Yes. Proof of endorse me, and then I get enough endorsements, I'm a human being on the system. It's not exactly that. I mean, it's a peer to peer gig manager, let's say. So you put up a gig and I take it, if I have the skills correct for satisfying this gig, and then you give me a rate.
01:58:36.848 - 01:59:35.756, Speaker A: So if this rate is equal or close to the rate that I claimed initially, then my identity is confirmed. If it is not, then it's an Iterative process, and we get, at a certain point, a median value that will give you a final score. Thank you for the question. Yeah, it's quite cool. I mean, you're creating a sort of, like, needed economy or I mean, a needed disruption, in a sense right. On those sort of products. I would say for our experience, the most critical part is the go to market and onboard with clarity all the different agents and participants and kind of babysit them through the protocol right.
01:59:35.756 - 02:00:10.984, Speaker A: And make them the path as easy as possible. So that's, to me, the focus on the go to market, because that's the tipping point just there. Yes, I agree. I mean, the thing is, what we did with Distributed Town and the way we use Aave and Chainlink are basically connected only to the quadratic treasury. So for the end user, it's just as easy as, for example, donating to a charity or donating to a project or to the public goods. They just go there. It's one click.
02:00:10.984 - 02:00:55.028, Speaker A: And they customize both the template. They want to invest in either open source art projects or local projects, and then they have this delegation agreement where they can pick either a 0% repayment till the 50% repayment plus interest. So it's basically a two step contract that they do while investing in the public goods. And this just one page for them, and it doesn't require any knowledge of Distributed Town chain link aven. So it's just very simple onboarding process. Good stuff. Does it make sense? Any last second question? No.
02:00:55.028 - 02:01:07.496, Speaker A: All right, thank you, guys. Thank you, guys. Good luck to us and good luck to the next ones. Thanks to my team as well. Bye, guys. Bye bye. Take care.
02:01:07.496 - 02:01:54.480, Speaker A: Good luck to the previous one. Our next team is Shuttle X Finance. Can start your demo. Okay, it can you see my screen? Am I on? Yes. Yeah, you might want to expand it. Okay, full screen. There it goes.
02:01:54.480 - 02:02:30.310, Speaker A: Hi, my name is Ben Snevans, and my project is called Shuttle X. At Finance, our main objective is to bring DFI into the life insurance space. Life insurance space is huge. It was 2.5 trillion in a 5.3 trillion insurance market. Additionally, we will be participating in the fixed income market, and that's worth $128,000,000,000,000 globally.
02:02:30.310 - 02:03:39.322, Speaker A: So we're talking about very significant markets, and those are, like, very important markets for the DFI space in that billions of dollars have been moved into crypto entities. And now through Aave and hopefully Shuttle X, we can provide investment vehicles in which those crypto assets could be collateralized loans taken out against them and invested in other markets or entities or anything they wish. So we think this is very important, very important to the DeFi market. In any case, I would like to give you a grant of our system here. Actually, let me just bring this right over here. Basically, our first customer, we have four main customers. Our first is really one who's just more into buying term insurance and maybe nothing else more.
02:03:39.322 - 02:05:19.280, Speaker A: So they'd be looking at different policies and selecting one and buying it, paying for it, and be totally happy to see the net portfolio and that'd be it. And they just be paying premiums. The second customer would be pretty much like the first, but they'd be more interested in maybe investing in our bonds because he has a little more capital and he's interested in bonds because he's more risk averse. So he's looking at yield. And our third customer, we figure, is going to be the reinsurers and they're going to be more interested in fixed income market and making markets, buying and selling and moving risk away from the major insurance companies. And then our fourth customer would be the Ave DeFi participants who are looking at now, as I said earlier, collateralizing their crypto entities taking out, putting it in these Ave protocol interest bearing instruments and basically then taking out funds and investing it in other entities. So basically this is what we're providing a credit delegation, maybe provide a Shuttle X bond fund where they can delegate to it and that could be invested in entities and investments being returned to them.
02:05:19.280 - 02:05:50.310, Speaker A: They could also trade in some of our different types of bonds that we set up. Flash loans, we figured, could be something where you buy bond that's particularly yield and sell it for certain price over term. In any case, we think this is a very big market and important. And I'm a software engineer. I'd like to move this further. This is just a hackathon. Thank you very much for listening.
02:05:50.310 - 02:06:22.934, Speaker A: Adios hi. Hello. Thank you. Benson very quick feedback, easy one. I think that if we are here, you're speaking with an audience which knows the potential of DeFi and how many billions and trillions are. It's the total addressable market, basically. We are aware of this.
02:06:22.934 - 02:07:14.680, Speaker A: So since it's a four minutes presentation, which is time sensitive, I would go straight to the product, define it with a few sentences and say, this is what I've built, this is what aims for. These are all the different participants, like protocol canvas in 20 seconds and then start with all the tangent, basically, and all the different things that users could do. So always start with the very bare, simple concept of what you're building and then expand to all the possibilities. I understand. Fair enough. That's all for me. Okay, I have a question.
02:07:14.680 - 02:08:05.596, Speaker A: I saw a few different screens, but I didn't see any actual transactions to the blockchain. Did you integrate any of these in a testnet? No, actually I hadn't done that. There was one other person on the team who was going to provide some of that, but he bailed out at the end of the second week. So pretty much what you have is the user interface and the idea driving this whole thing. Okay. Sorry if I can say really quick. Also, one suggestion.
02:08:05.596 - 02:08:55.496, Speaker A: I see that there are many products and offerings that you plan to have. I would say initially just focus on one and try to get that going before trying some of the others because a lot of them are big undertakings, working with bonds and with flash loans and with credit delegation and life insurance. They're like many different things. So I would focus on a single one and try to get that going first. Yeah, sorry, go ahead. I was just going to echo that and just say I think I got pretty confused at what the product was because you mentioned life insurance. But then you're showing flash phones.
02:08:55.496 - 02:10:02.804, Speaker A: I'm like, do they really need to be able to use flash loans yet? That may be a bit intense for someone that just wants to get life insurance. I guess the advice there is just do one thing and just be really good at doing that one thing. You only need one thing to go to the moon. Anyway, I guess my question is I didn't fully understand the life insurance product, the SpaceX token and how that worked. Right, well, the entire idea is to bring in more capital into the DeFi space. And so basically you're looking at a customer facing system bringing capital in and then would be securitizing it, creating possibly zero coupon bonds on the back end and providing a fixed income market that now is totally based on crypto DeFi and link it with the ability of depositors in ave based protocol systems to now engage now with the fixed income side. So they're not really engaging with the life insurance.
02:10:02.804 - 02:10:31.900, Speaker A: Life insurance is just a way of bringing in capital, more capital into the system to create larger markets. Awesome. That about puts us at time. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Our next project is Idea Factory. Feel free to start your presentation.
02:10:31.900 - 02:11:04.490, Speaker A: Sure. Just give me 1 second. Let me share my screen. Okay, we're good. I think the audio is low because I can hear very far. Sorry, I think I must have forgot. Yeah, I forgot to share sound.
02:11:04.490 - 02:12:20.988, Speaker A: Let's go back a bit. Tell me if this is better for Market Make 2021 as part or Idea Factory, which was created by me, and I worked on it with Sophie for this hackathon. So there are plenty of problems with traditional startup funding models as well as lack of access for your everyday users, even though crowdsourcing methods do solve that, but at the cost of more risk and less rewards as well. For the startup, there is a lot of work and knowledge and time and effort that it takes to become a successful founder and it's very hard to do, as I'm sure many of us know. In fact, over 90% of startups fail. So what are the tools that Idea Factory uses to try to solve these problems? So here is a typical flow for Idea Factory. So a founder creates an idea, an investor can fund that idea, contributors can contribute advice, design, development to an idea and also get rewarded.
02:12:20.988 - 02:13:19.380, Speaker A: And then once the funding is over, the founder gets their money and the investors and the contributors get to claim rewards. So following up on that, I'm sure there are some questions still left unanswered. So we allow people to stake two ideas using vote tokens. So it's a synthetic token where the price of it is determined by the total amount staked across the entire platform, divided by the total number of ideas on the platform or average funds per idea. An idea token is a token that obviously represents the worth of idea and it is determined by the value of vote staked to that idea. And funders are rewarded a certain number of tokens based on the percentage of votes they provide. So for example, if you provide $1 to an idea that already has a dollar, then you'll get 0.5
02:13:19.380 - 02:13:49.960, Speaker A: tokens. So, quick demo showing the app in action. Keep in mind, this is very early proof of concept. So we have all these categories that we use to denote categories for ideas. So DFI business. Whatever. We're adding one called Baking, we zoom through, so these are problems for that category.
02:13:49.960 - 02:15:02.700, Speaker A: So l two decks, very big topics right now in crypto, and we could add an idea to one of these called Dex two. And then we'll go view those ideas and we'll see that each of them right now has four votes. And yeah, in the future we would add withdrawal functions, et cetera, et cetera. And some of those future plans are launch idea synth on Uma, launch finalized vote token on uma, add withdrawal, liquidation to Smart Contracts, add rewards for contributors and iterate on above and launch version two of app on Coven. So, thank you very much for attending this presentation and I look forward to hearing your feedback and questions. So yeah, hi, is it okay if I start? Please. Cool.
02:15:02.700 - 02:15:52.700, Speaker A: My first suggestion would be that the most interesting part for me in a presentation is the actual demo. It was a video that you mostly jumped over and I didn't really get to see much of what you built. So just like for future presentations like that, usually to us judges is the most important part. After that, this gave me some vibes of the original, the Dow. I don't know if you were around for that back in 2016. So it is like a way for people to come together and fund different projects. Right? Right.
02:15:52.700 - 02:17:13.650, Speaker A: Yeah. I wasn't really around for the Dow, but I did some research and that was certainly something that popped up. I don't know if the Dow I think the big thing is this idea that people can contribute in non monetary ways, whether it be advice dev, development or graphic design, whatever, and they can also get rewarded. I think that's a big thing that kind of differentiates idea factory from other stuff like the Dow. So for the graphic designers, would one idea be that if I contribute to a project and I do this really cool design, people can vote to give me money? Is that like the basic principle behind it? Basically, yeah. So the idea is you would submit say like a logo or something and the creator of that idea and the other stakers who want to see succeed would vote on your design. And if a bunch of people really like it, then you would also get a stake in the project.
02:17:13.650 - 02:18:36.670, Speaker A: And then the more success that project has, obviously the more you're rewarded and the more everyone else is rewarded as well. So obviously it's best for you and it's best for everyone else to have valuable people to contribute because that will overall make the project more likely to succeed. I have one point on exactly these. How do you link the idea to the final project which could have a completely different set up, completely different entity, a much more sophisticated fundraise, whatever. So I get the economics of participating on an idea and so you are creating an economy around the idea. But the idea, it's only worth when there is an execution, if I'm not mistaken. So how do you ensure this connection between successful execution and a successful, let's say, idea picking? Right? So that is something that right now we don't really have.
02:18:36.670 - 02:20:03.930, Speaker A: Ideally it would be something like a profit sharing token or some royalty equity sharing token. But right now where the worst comes, it comes from the donations or the investments from other people, if that makes sense. Okay, so it's like a Kickstarter. You think go for this idea and then you sort of hope that the founder is grateful enough to go back and honor the people that have been betting honey's idea. Kind of there is going to be a way, I'm not sure. We're either going to do funding rounds or it's going to be like a perpetual just ongoing funding. So basically from an investor standpoint, if the majority of investors think that, hey, this guy or this idea isn't delivering, then they can start a vote to liquidate and that would liquidate the idea as a whole and hopefully return the majority of funds back to investors.
02:20:03.930 - 02:20:54.470, Speaker A: So it is similar to Kickstarter, but it has that added security that if the majority of investors think that the project isn't getting enough done, then they can start a liquidation vote. Okay? Yeah, I see the founder. If my VC could liquidate me after six months, I'd be reagent. Well, again, it needs a majority. Right? If you have 1000 investors, they would have to have a good reason to liquidate. Like, they can't just liquidate for no reason. Yeah, but to me, like, a product like this, it needs to have a tangible connection with execution.
02:20:54.470 - 02:21:41.020, Speaker A: Right? Because everybody says ideas are worth nothing. It's the execution. So I get it to create an economy around ideas. But to me, there is it needs to be connected to the execution and there needs to be a sort of bridge between those two steps, because otherwise you just have a pure speculation. It could be a platform where people just come and copy the idea and go make it somewhere. Right. I know time is up, so I don't want to get too philosophical, but that's a good way to end it, because time is up.
02:21:41.020 - 02:22:13.040, Speaker A: It's also this team judges the last three teams that you might see in your list. Buy now, pay later. Silk Link and Ming Luo are not in this session, so we are done. So everyone, thank you. This was session seven. This will conclude the judging phase of market. Make everybody keep an eye on the closing ceremony later this week.
02:22:13.040 - 02:22:30.120, Speaker A: I'd like to thank all of the judges. Thank you, guys. Mariano, Nicola and Patrick. Much appreciated. Thanks to all the hackers. It's been a pleasure, everything. And we will see you guys later.
02:22:30.120 - 02:22:35.826, Speaker A: Okay? Good. Take care, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ciao, Mariano. Ciao, Patrick.
02:22:35.826 - 02:22:37.810, Speaker A: Bye. Bye, everyone. Bye.
