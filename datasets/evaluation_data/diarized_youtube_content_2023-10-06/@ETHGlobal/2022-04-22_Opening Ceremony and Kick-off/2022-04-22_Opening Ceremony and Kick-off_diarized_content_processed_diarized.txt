00:02:36.420 - 00:10:55.830, Speaker A: We don't be ram you. It, it it's like but, like, you Barney. Yeah.
00:10:58.440 - 00:10:59.590, Speaker B: You'Re gonna, like.
00:14:16.460 - 00:21:33.080, Speaker A: 14, like, also here's. That's it. It's, it, it's, it.
00:23:37.810 - 00:23:53.570, Speaker C: Hello. Hello. It's good to be back. Good evening, everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of East Global and super excited to welcome all of you to our first ever in person event in two years. Welcome to East Amsterdam.
00:23:53.570 - 00:24:32.250, Speaker C: We're at this incredible venue this weekend. BBB is a historic building. This used to be the country's first modern stock exchange over a century ago. I think it just serves as, like, a perfect place for us to really shape the future of money. So I'm excited for all of you to be in this building and to the thousands of you that couldn't be here in person. We're also streaming all of this and the whole weekend on Ethbola TV, so we'll be able to watch any other workshop and talk on the website and on YouTube. So ETH Amsterdam is part of DevConnect.
00:24:32.250 - 00:25:15.270, Speaker C: A lot of you have been here this entire week or you've enjoyed a lot of the other things going on aside from this hackathon. And before we kick everything off, I want to take a quick second and really thank Skyler, Natalia, Adam and the rest of the DevConnect team at the Ethereum Foundation, really putting this week together. It's been an incredible, just amazing thing that's been put on with so much attention to detail and all the hard work. Please give them a big round of applause and want to thank Aseat Global for the whole DevConnect team for making this weekend happen for us as well. So let's go right into it. First things first, this is not a conference, and we'll get into a lot of that in the next few minutes. We're 8th Global and we have a very simple mission.
00:25:15.270 - 00:25:52.502, Speaker C: Our goal is to onboard thousands of developers into the Web Three ecosystem. And we do this by focusing on builders. The events we do are very much about building interesting things, bringing on developers, designers, creators, anybody who wants to build things. The goal and emphasis is very much about focusing on learning, being able to get the help, and just growing, to everything from your full potential to learning about the things you're excited about. So the theme here for this entire weekend is going to be few distractions and more time building stuff. And we believe showing is better than telling. And the whole weekend is set up with that philosophy in mind.
00:25:52.502 - 00:26:34.020, Speaker C: And I'm excited to tell you all about this in the next few minutes. We kind of have done this same thing for multiple in person events for the last four years across five different continents. And it's just so exciting that we're able to do this again this year onwards. And we have five more to go. And this is just the very first one in 2022. And not only just that, we also managed to figure out so many amazing ways to bring the same philosophy and culture onto the online events. The last two years were also equally exciting for us on the online side, but we had so many events where we're able to bring on people from all over the world and really remove any constraint around physically being in any given city.
00:26:34.020 - 00:27:01.610, Speaker C: And over the past four years, 8th Global has brought more than 50,000 developers and people in this ecosystem. We've seen over 4000 projects come out of it. And although we don't really care about this metric, but the companies that have come out of the projects from the hackathons have collectively raised over $500 million. And it is a massive thing that we never thought would be a thing that we would see. But it still brings me a lot of joy to bring that forward. All right, so all that history. Let's get that over with.
00:27:01.610 - 00:27:20.286, Speaker C: Let's go into East Amsterdam. This is an incredible venue and so many people are here today. We have 100 attendees in this building for this entire weekend. They're coming in 56 different countries, and 31% of the people participating are new to the Web Three ecosystem. We're coming on from web two. That is a massive number. It does deserve a big round of applause.
00:27:20.286 - 00:28:07.650, Speaker C: These are specifically people quitting their jobs in Web Two to be able to go all in on Web Three, and I can't wait to see what everybody builds. In addition to that, we have over 100 mentors from our partners and dedicated people who are there to help you unblock, whether it's technical or go to market or anything else that you would like to know. And we have 40 technical workshops that will be hands on stuff around how to use different protocols or everything that's happening in the world of any given topic you could think of. From NFTs to Scalability to DFI to you name it. And only seven talks. We're going to very keep it specific around things that we think are important for us to know about the development of ethereum and everything that is an active research problem. So we'll minimize a lot of talking and we'll make sure that you all get to chat with each other in person and see what everybody else is working on.
00:28:07.650 - 00:28:39.530, Speaker C: And of course, prizes. There are $400,000 in prizes to be won. We'll kind of get everybody on to tell you about what the prizes are and how you can win them and also how you can think about choosing what to work on. So before we go into all of this, I want to thank the 50 incredible partners that made this event happen. Gearbox optimism, dYdX one inch network, ave grant style live peer IPFS filecoin and polygon wallet connect and scale. Without their support, this would not be possible. So please give them a big round of applause.
00:28:39.530 - 00:29:34.334, Speaker C: We'll just keep the applause going. I'm going to name all 40 more logos in order as fast as I can, and let's just keep the energy going. So Tatum Mina superfluid Skill Wallet, lens Protocol radical Tribe dow web, three OD Bolts tempus uniswap Grants Program coinbase Wallet the Graph nosis APWind Connect, uma sirion Gelato, EPNS, QuickNote dksync boba network blockdemon, Ambir, fendora evmos student analytics, spruce Union, urine finance flux fuel anchor coinspec, swing, Stackos, cyber Connect and Zkpad thank you so much. We're going to bring some of them on again, too. But you can talk to all these amazing companies building so many incredible protocols and just make your lives easier with the SDKs and not reinvent the wheel as you have only 36 hours to hack. All right, so let's get started. A couple of things we're going to do here.
00:29:34.334 - 00:30:08.970, Speaker C: We're going to just quickly talk about the agenda. We're going to have a quick interview here, and after that, we're going to bring on some of our partners. And then for those of you who are still looking for a team, right after everybody we're done here, we're going to meet in this corner. And anybody who's still looking for a team, we're going to just do a quick team formation session in person. So you can join us if you have any ideas or you're still looking for teammates, you can do that right after this ends. But before that, we want to have a quick interview with a person who needs no introduction. So without further ado, let's welcome Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Bitcoin Magazine, on stage.
00:30:08.970 - 00:30:37.670, Speaker C: Hello. All right, so we were thinking about the stuff we wanted to cover today, and it's all over the place when I talk about the future of the past, personal stuff, but let's get right into it at this point. What could stop the merch from happening?
00:30:38.360 - 00:31:19.052, Speaker A: Did you hear the announcement? We delayed it until 2027. No, I think realistically, what could slow down the merge? Definitely unexpected security books. If you wake up in some crazy high month of this year and you discover that the merge hasn't happened yet, some security bugs in the clients is probably going to be the reason things that cannot stop the merge, any kind of weird minor malfeasance. Like if miners try to do some last minute thing to break the merge, that'll just mean there's going to be some kind of manual fork and it'll happen faster.
00:31:19.116 - 00:31:25.800, Speaker C: What are the possible scenarios of that? And also, could you talk about the difficulty bond?
00:31:25.900 - 00:32:19.270, Speaker A: I mean, what could miners do? In principle, miners could 51% attack around the same time as the merge, but with the way the merge is designed, it's basically designed so that the beacon chain fork choice just picks one of the forks and so we're fine. Miners could, if they were really coordinated, kind of stage a protest and just all quit. And if they do that, then we set a particular terminal to whole difficulty and so they could just make it take a really long time until we get there. But if they do something like that and it's really serious then once again people will just make an update that just either changes the TTD or just sets a particular hash. Right? So there's always a recovery. Mean what else can they do? They can make FUD about centralization on Twitter. I don't know.
00:32:19.270 - 00:33:17.364, Speaker A: I think honest at this point, practically speaking, I do feel like miners have generally realized that Ethereum is going to proof of stake. And a lot of them are not just miners, they're also stakers and plenty of them are very happy to be participating in both parts of Ethereum's transition. So I'm actually not too worried. And lots of them, I'm sure they're going to want to start mining on Ethereum Classic or Zcash or any of these other systems. And so they as an industry do have a kind of common interest even going beyond Ethereum there. So yeah, I guess not too worried about that. I don't know what else I feel like aside from the possibility of software bugs which is exactly what we're in the process of testing to find out.
00:33:17.364 - 00:33:18.868, Speaker A: It's pretty much a full speed ahead.
00:33:18.954 - 00:33:36.492, Speaker C: So I think this obviously kind of touches upon just the complexity that lies in the base layer and you've kind of talked and blogged a lot about just how the layer one should be as simple as possible. What's kind of the philosophy behind that? How does that kind of now reflect on the design for the merge and let's go deeper into that.
00:33:36.626 - 00:34:26.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I think in Ethereum we've been kind of moving toward this hybrid philosophy where layer one tries to be kind of very simple or at least as simple as it realistically can be. While layer two kind of takes on the complexity burden of providing very high levels of scaling, providing privacy, providing a lot of the things that users want. Right. The changes that are all kind of going in the direction of layer one does improve somewhat like it switches to proof of stake. We add to Dank Sharding which accounts a lot of data that the chain gets consensus on the rollups can use and all of these things. But the goal is still to try to add a limited number of tools. That's a very general purpose.
00:34:26.120 - 00:34:30.190, Speaker A: Then the layer two and the application layer kind of does the rest.
00:34:30.640 - 00:34:41.376, Speaker C: What's the design process of that? Do you actively refuse to think about adding changes to the base layer or is that more of like you only get to realize this in retrospect. How do you kind of think about that as you're planning this?
00:34:41.558 - 00:34:44.224, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not my decision.
00:34:44.272 - 00:34:46.710, Speaker C: Right, sorry, not you specifically, just as.
00:34:47.880 - 00:36:58.332, Speaker A: I know on one of the recent all core devs calls just decided to kind of not really push hard on kind of non merger related EIPS for a while. In general, I think there's definitely been kind of more and more pushback on adding EIPS, like even things like pre compiled that would have easily gotten in two or three years ago. They just have a harder time justifying themselves now, which I think is healthy. I think it's good to kind of not keep on increasing complexity forever and kind of throwing the kitchen sink in and growing step back and think, what do we really need? So there's definitely an attitude of growing conservatism toward changing things. If I had to kind of change that formula a little bit, I would say what I would want to see is not just conservatism in terms of the size of the changes, but also conservatism in terms of the final results. Not just thinking about changing a little, but also, can we make changes toward an ethereum of tomorrow that's simpler than the ethereum of today? So, like, banning self destruct is probably one of those examples, right? I do not want a world where your grandchildren wake up at some dark, rainy morning in 2072, take a look at the killer AI robots outside briefly and then ask you, but Grandpa, why does ethereum just have all of this extra two layer weird state tree structure? And why does it have half RLP and half SSZ? And why is creating my own node so hard? And you have to answer, well, because some people in 2022 kind of just basically gave up and prioritize backwards compatibility, right? I think there is something to the virtue of kind of accepting some short term costs in order to achieve long term benefits. And obviously it's important to prioritize and obviously you can't do everything at the same time.
00:36:58.332 - 00:37:20.148, Speaker A: But having this kind of discussion around what are things that do incur short term costs but are going to actually make things better. Ethereum, a better system into a simpler system in the long, long term is like a discussion that would definitely love to see more of.
00:37:20.234 - 00:37:29.690, Speaker C: So maybe this is a good time to understand how that got applied to sharding and the design and the architecture. Could you tell us about the original design, what it is now, how that happened?
00:37:30.220 - 00:38:41.970, Speaker A: Well, in that case, it's a bit of a different situation, right? Because sharding is something new and so the question of minimizing complexity of the change and minimizing complexity of the final outcome, they just end up being perfectly aligned with each other. And the design really did evolve a lot in the direction of simplifying the base layer. Right? So at the beginning there was this really complicated quadratic and then eventually cubic sharding design and you had committees on top of committees and you had chains on top of chains and it got really crazy. And then eventually that simplified down to a beacon chain with a bunch of shards that had crossed that were chains that had cross links. Eventually that simplified further. We got rid of the cross links, we got rid of the shards with an independent fork choice and now we don't even have shard blocks. Right? Like the Dank sharding design is actually very ultra minimal because it basically even has one proposer that just chooses all the contents for the entire block, like the entire 16 or 32 megabytes or whatever, and it ends up being right.
00:38:41.970 - 00:39:20.280, Speaker A: And that is much like it definitely is still complex. Right. But at the same time, it's vastly better than what we would have had to deal with had we actually tried to properly implement any of the designs from 2017, while at the same time also having these five other roadmaps of account abstraction and proof of stake and vertical trees and all of those things. Right. So I do think that the ethereum kind of research community learned and has updated a lot in the direction of proposing things that are actually implementable.
00:39:21.660 - 00:39:52.292, Speaker C: So I think the interesting thing I've noticed is that this is a very recurring theme and it's like a great thing, which is we kind of have initial ideas, they get kind of iterated on, then they just become simpler or even better or just more efficient. Is that something that you think is because we're able to minimize the feedback loops or is that because we just have a lot more research that's kind of being applied faster than in other industries? Why is this repetitive in a good way? As a theme, from your perspective, why is what repetitive? Not repetitive. Sorry. Why do we see this happen often.
00:39:52.426 - 00:39:56.884, Speaker A: That the designs get simplified, especially in.
00:39:56.922 - 00:39:57.952, Speaker C: How we think about scalability?
00:39:58.016 - 00:40:42.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think a big part of it is, first of all, just the quality of the research team improving. Second, I think the more kind of research thinks hard, the more it actually can build things that don't require developers to work as hard. And ultimately, development is a bigger slog than research is. Right. So I think it's good when you can make those trade offs and just think a little harder and make something better. The other thing is also just the proposals keep improving because you have the benefit of understanding versions one to version N of the thing when you build version N plus one of the thing, I think it's a combination of both of those two.
00:40:43.400 - 00:40:47.592, Speaker C: It's just impressive that we see that consistently happen on the research side.
00:40:47.726 - 00:40:56.570, Speaker A: And then three, obviously, is just this ongoing process of actually just learning to value real simplicity more.
00:40:56.940 - 00:41:17.196, Speaker C: Amazing. Well, speaking of simplification, I want to talk about two EIPS and I think it'll be good to kind of have you talk about what they are first and then let's kind of go into should or should they not be included? Let's start with 48, 44, what is it and should that exist.
00:41:17.388 - 00:41:58.872, Speaker A: Sure. So EAP 48 44, aka proto dank sharding, I guess. Okay, to explain that, maybe we need to start going into dank sharding in a bit more detail. Right? So dank sharding is the sharding design that is kind of the result of this long chain of simplifying things and throwing things out after we started from crazy chains inside of chains back inside of chains back in 2015. And the way dank sharding works is you still have one block per slot. It looks like basically just like a regular non charted chain. Except validator nodes don't actually have to validate everything, right? Instead, validator nodes randomly select a few pieces of every block to verify.
00:41:58.872 - 00:43:17.524, Speaker A: And because of erasure, coding, data availability, sampling a bunch of math magic, that's actually enough, right? It's actually enough for every validator to only verify a few randomly selected pieces of these big 16 megabytes Blobs or I guess blob lists. Now, the problem with the eggsharding though, is that it does require like eraser coding and all of this stuff to actually be implemented. And so what happens before then? Right, so before then we have proto dank sharding, which is basically a kind of halfway house that can happen before full dank sharding can really be rolled out. And what happens there is it's kind of like you do dank sharding without actually sharding the data, right? Basically you introduce all of the data formats exactly as they will exist in full dank sharding. Like, you introduce this concept of Blobs like transactions with this extra really big piece of data that's much cheaper, but that can't be accessed directly from the EVM. You introduce KZG commitments, you introduce all the math, you introduce all the ways that interaction between the execution and consensus layer will work. You basically do all of the kind of infrastructure work, except you don't do this kind of like random sampling check.
00:43:17.524 - 00:43:38.030, Speaker A: You still require everyone to just fully download all the blobs and check them. Right? So in every slot, everyone would actually have to download and check maybe about a megabyte of data. So this amount of data is still a lot. It still provides a huge amount of space for roll ups. It still stands good chance of making roll ups way cheaper than they are today.
00:43:40.240 - 00:43:42.930, Speaker C: Does this have any long term effects on the state size?
00:43:43.700 - 00:44:19.460, Speaker A: Right, so on the state size, no, because these blobs are not part of the state. But on the history side, EIP. Four four. Four is another important one. This is the history expiry EIP, basically making it so that clients don't have to store really old history anymore. And this is important both to keep the disk size of an ethereum node small and also actually to allow ethereum implementations to become simpler. Right, because you don't need one implementation to be able to process all past versions of the Ethereum protocol that ever existed.
00:44:19.460 - 00:45:07.880, Speaker A: You need it to be able to just process maybe the last one or two hard forks. And then if you really want to have a node that checks the entire history, you can basically just download multiple versions of the client. And then we'll have to serially verify. Yeah, serially verify. We'll have to implement some interchange format so you can run one of them, then export the post state, import that as a pre state to the second one, run a few more blocks, export the post date and put it into the third and all that. But that's all doable. And basically the idea is to try to allow the nodes responsible for a consensus, allow the nodes responsible for the really critical thing of keeping the blockchain running today to kind of be as simple as possible.
00:45:07.880 - 00:46:03.864, Speaker A: And there are going to be ways of doing all the other stuff. There are already plenty of ideas on how to create automated networks to kind of automatically start backing up all of the history and make that really robust. So it's basically guaranteed with a one of interest model that the history will be saved and also actually be able to check and see what happened in the history. But that would be a kind of somewhat more specialized functionality and users who care about that will be able to do it. But users who only wants to run a node to verify what's going on today would not have to concern themselves with that and they'll be able to just process a narrower piece of the chain. So yeah, that's the AP four four four. What about 4337-4337 is the account abstraction.
00:46:03.864 - 00:46:53.900, Speaker A: I believe it's going to have a presentation tomorrow, so I highly recommend people watch it. But account abstraction, this is another one of those things that I've cared about for a long time. Basically, it's like making smart contract wallets first class citizens, right? So today's there's two kinds of accounts in Ethereum. There's what we call EOAS, externally owned accounts, which are the accounts that most people have their coins and assets and everything in. And then there are smart contract wallets. Smart contract wallets use smart contract code to be able to impose arbitrary conditions on when the funds can be spent, right? So you can have a multi SIG wallet where you have say, five different keys that might even be controlled by different people and you need three of them to approve a transaction. You could have social recovery wallet where like a three of five can change the key that's needed to sign.
00:46:53.900 - 00:47:22.468, Speaker A: You could replace ECDSA with a different signature scheme. You could replace it with something quantum resistant. You could do a lot of things. But the problem is that smart contract wallets, today, smart contract wallets cannot initiate transactions. And so actually using one requires you to have some money in an EOA and you basically just needlessly complicated. And that's a big part of why not many people use it. But then EOAS, they only support one form of authentication, which is one single private key.
00:47:22.468 - 00:48:03.520, Speaker A: Right? So what 4337 does is basically it's like an extra protocol, second layer way to make smart contract wallets basically be as convenient as EOA wallets are today. And so regular users, it will be much easier to actually have one of these more secure multi SAG or social recovery or whatever kinds of wallets. And so you would actually be able to feel safe and comfortable using Ethereum without having to worry about what happens if someone hacks my computer and steals my private key or what if my private key gets lost.
00:48:07.960 - 00:48:10.756, Speaker C: Is it just in the implementation phase or kind of how do we think.
00:48:10.778 - 00:48:18.650, Speaker A: About that from just I believe it's already on testnets. I believe ERC four, three, seven is going to be released on the main net fairly soon.
00:48:19.420 - 00:48:43.548, Speaker C: That should change how most of the hackathon projects work. That's going to be awesome. You already touched upon the quality of researches that have kind of come on in the last few years to kind of improve the protocol. But let's kind of zoom out a little bit and go into how do you think the Ethereum Foundation's role has changed in that same window and just kind of from your perspective, what was the role now and how do you think the Role Foundation serves?
00:48:43.644 - 00:49:29.288, Speaker A: I think the Ethereum Foundation, first of all, it has really stepped up on kind of improving its quality, improving its organizational capacity. There's just a lot of things that the Ethereum Foundation was completely not capable of doing just because it did not have people. And there would be lots of people who would just say like, hey, can we do this? And I just unfortunately would not be able to point them to people who can actually do it. And now all of that stuff is just so much better. Right? There's excellent people in the foundation. Steven Gilbert has been doing a lot of Latin America work, some other things. Josh Stark has been great at just organizing a whole bunch of things in the foundation core.
00:49:29.288 - 00:50:08.632, Speaker A: And there's this I am, Iguochinu Executive director, has definitely been great and both her work kind of organizing the foundation and a lot of the philosophy that she's introducing I think have been excellent. So just a lot of really good people lately that I'm very happy about. So it's definitely a much more capable organization. It's definitely an organization more capable of starting to have breathing room to think about the long term. Big questions. In 2016 and 17 we barely had breathing room. In 2015 we barely had money.
00:50:08.632 - 00:50:22.472, Speaker A: And then because of barely having money, we barely had people. And then in 2016 and 17 we barely had enough people to do things. And finally over the last four years we've really managed to exit that kind of vicious cycle, which has been excellent.
00:50:22.536 - 00:50:34.930, Speaker C: We can actually observe it too, which is the great part. Just the last two years have been phenomenal and just seeing more transparency, the level of effort going into different geographies, just this event itself. Defconnect I absolutely agree.
00:50:35.460 - 00:50:38.400, Speaker A: Yay. Defconnect.
00:50:44.360 - 00:50:54.170, Speaker C: Do you think the Ethereum Foundation should just focus on making the protocol better, or do you think this expands into supporting or collaborating with other.
00:50:56.220 - 00:51:41.684, Speaker A: Mean? I think there's definitely room for the Ethereum Foundation to get more involved at the application layer. And I also think that there's more room for everyone except the foundation to get more involved at the protocol layer. Right. To some extent this has happened already. Right. But I think for the first couple of years we have had this kind of interesting sort of like half decentralization, where, no, there's these five different layer two client teams, or well, there's way more like five different not layer twos consensus client teams. And there's a lot of layer two teams, there's a lot of execution layer teams, but a big part of a lot of their budgets would still come from the foundation.
00:51:41.684 - 00:52:01.880, Speaker A: Right. And so it sets up the structure, but the foundation still kind of has this kind of very strong, very central role. But we were already starting to see signs of that diversifying. We're already seeing signs of actors outside of the foundation supporting all of these different teams, supporting all these different individual developers.
00:52:01.960 - 00:52:05.904, Speaker C: And you're referring to just kind of companies in this space that are companies is one.
00:52:06.022 - 00:52:35.290, Speaker A: Obviously, there's consensus there's the various different Dowels, I think, like, Lido announced that they're supporting Protocol Guild, the whole Protocol Guild effort in general, I think the NFT for EIP 1559, and there's, I think, a lot of potential for this to go much further. I think we still need to remember that we are in a world where I believe is it still true that the uniswap Dow has more capital than the foundation does?
00:52:35.980 - 00:52:44.430, Speaker C: I believe so too. Yeah, I guess. What about collaboration with other layer ones? Do you see a future where we can work with the Bitcoin community?
00:52:44.960 - 00:53:45.184, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Yeah. Anything can happen. I think coming out of the COVID pandemic, new century, new challenges, it's possibly time to make new friends. Yeah, well, I think especially both the Bitcoin and the Ethereum ecosystems are just kind of so different from what they were five years ago, and they're just clearly here do things that are somewhat similar and also somewhat different. And I think there's a queer sign that actually coexistence between these two ecosystems is possible. And I think the big thing that you need for people to feel comfortable cooperating is the feeling that there doesn't exist a kind of neither can live while the other survives a relationship between the two.
00:53:45.184 - 00:54:10.052, Speaker A: Right. Because once people are at their most evil, not out of greed, but out of fear. Right. When people perceive that if they don't fight. For their interests and for their own interests, that they're going to lose to some existential threat. That's when people are going to be the most willing to sacrifice everything for their interests. And if the competitive part of the relationship is not an existential one, that already just reduces the temperature.
00:54:10.052 - 00:54:18.260, Speaker A: So much technical collaboration is definitely possible. There's definitely some happening already.
00:54:18.350 - 00:54:19.230, Speaker C: Like I said.
00:54:21.600 - 00:54:37.120, Speaker A: The nerds generally, they're happy to kind of ignore the politics and just work on really fun and cool stuff and interpolate the polynomials together, which I think is great and I think more and more very possible over time.
00:54:37.190 - 00:54:48.836, Speaker C: That's great. All right, so for the next section, I'm going to call that Underrated overrated. I'm going to give you a topic you comment on is if this is Underrated overrated, and then a short answer on why.
00:54:48.938 - 00:54:49.492, Speaker A: Sure.
00:54:49.626 - 00:54:56.260, Speaker C: So, 1st, 185 percent hot green tea, 15% red wine, underrated.
00:54:57.400 - 00:55:03.850, Speaker A: Only a few people have heard of it so far. We need to spread this. We need to make it the new thing, the current thing.
00:55:05.580 - 00:55:07.268, Speaker C: We'll try to serve that at midnight.
00:55:07.364 - 00:55:08.010, Speaker A: Okay.
00:55:08.460 - 00:55:10.516, Speaker C: One coin, one vote.
00:55:10.708 - 00:55:30.060, Speaker A: I mean, one coin is a scam. Like token. Voting governance, I think realistically, I think still overrated. I've yelled a lot at it, but I feel like the yelling hasn't really yet translated into people actually seriously experimenting with alternatives.
00:55:30.140 - 00:55:37.444, Speaker C: What's a good framework for thinking about how voting or governance should work overall? It's a very broad, deep question, but specifically for the vote, it is.
00:55:37.482 - 00:55:56.424, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think there's one framework. I think there's a few different frameworks. One of them is collusion resistance. Basically how to prevent concentrated interests from always beating out diffuse interests. Right. Because that's the big problem that always happens in the world. And plutocracy is actually not very good at that.
00:55:56.424 - 00:56:23.564, Speaker A: Like what other things can be. The second is how to the first one, you can think about it in two ways. You can think about it in kind of like mild ways, where you have the concentrated interest as a fairly tame actor, like, I don't know, paradigm. Paradigm is tame. Right. And the diffuse interest as just like random community members. But then on the other end, there's the concentrated interest as like a hostile attacker.
00:56:23.564 - 00:56:29.868, Speaker A: That's like there was that $80 million DFI hack, right? Like someone tried to roll their own stablecoin.
00:56:29.964 - 00:56:31.436, Speaker C: Technically not a hack.
00:56:31.628 - 00:57:02.456, Speaker A: Right? Technically it was a yellow was it was working as intent. It was a special cryptographic operation. Yeah. So basically what happened there was like, there was this someone tried to roll their own stablecoin and it had a Governance token. And the governance token had something like an $80 million market cap. And this is like lower than the value of the assets it was protected.
00:57:02.488 - 00:57:03.950, Speaker C: That was the treasury, I believe.
00:57:04.640 - 00:57:12.912, Speaker A: Yeah, the governance tokens was lower than the value of the treasury. And so someone did a flash loan, and they just, like, borrowed 51% of the governance tokens. Right.
00:57:12.966 - 00:57:21.024, Speaker C: And they voted to transfer the money to them as a governance vote, and then they flash loaned it themselves and it got approved.
00:57:21.152 - 00:57:26.470, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. So you want to be resistant to attacks. Right.
00:57:29.160 - 00:57:31.284, Speaker C: Is delay the best way of thinking about that?
00:57:31.402 - 00:57:33.156, Speaker A: Well, I mean, delay is like civil.
00:57:33.188 - 00:57:34.776, Speaker C: Resistance in a different way.
00:57:34.798 - 00:58:09.028, Speaker A: Figure out civil resistance. I think the delay thing can kind of it can help in the short term, it's a Band Aid, but in my article, I think it was, like, moving beyond coin voting governance or something like that. I talk about some longer term financial attacks that can still work no matter what the delays are. So I think it's still concerning. So that's one framework of thinking about collusion and attack resistance. Another framework is how to ensure that the decisions are high quality. Right.
00:58:09.028 - 00:58:38.750, Speaker A: Like, basically, how do you ensure that the people with the governance power actually are people with expertise who actually deserve to have the governance power? And delegation is one of the answers, but delegation might not be the only answer because it's still subject to yeah, I mean, there's, like, people who don't know and who know that they don't know, but then there's people who don't know that they don't know. Right. And if they're going to just delegate to peep the frog number 12437, then that's also not the best.
00:58:40.800 - 00:58:49.244, Speaker C: I think we should go on to the rest of the because there's a lot more there. PFP. NFTs PFP.
00:58:49.292 - 00:59:20.380, Speaker A: NFTs I think a bit overrated just because the problem is you can clone them. And we don't really have good infrastructure for telling clones apart from not clones, and even answering the philosophical question of when is a clone even an illegitimate clone in the first place, and when is it just like, Yo, dog? That's part of the game. Public goods funding still one of the most important problems in the world, so probably still underrated.
00:59:22.880 - 00:59:26.284, Speaker C: Actually, I have way more questions, so I won't dig into it.
00:59:26.482 - 00:59:31.980, Speaker A: RLP I mean, it's still part of the ethereum protocol, so it's overrated.
00:59:36.080 - 00:59:37.340, Speaker C: Play DOH earn.
00:59:37.680 - 00:59:41.970, Speaker A: Play DOH art like the philosophy. Earn oh, play to earn. Oh, I see.
00:59:43.700 - 00:59:44.916, Speaker C: We can do that.
00:59:45.098 - 00:59:49.540, Speaker A: Art of the Greek philosopher. I definitely would want to see some more plato art.
00:59:49.610 - 00:59:50.230, Speaker C: Yes.
00:59:51.320 - 01:00:10.132, Speaker A: Would you have Plato art as your PFP, maybe? Okay. Yeah. Plato earn. I think probably a bit overrated. I think the problem that I see with it is that I haven't yet seen a credible story about who would actually be the one that's providing the capital that people end up earning by playing.
01:00:10.196 - 01:00:16.430, Speaker C: Is that an argument for just not having enough time passed, or you just mean it's an economically it's just an economic thing.
01:00:16.960 - 01:00:21.260, Speaker A: If you have token outflow, you have to have token inflow. Who's going to pay for the inflow?
01:00:21.780 - 01:00:22.690, Speaker C: Got it.
01:00:24.100 - 01:00:28.876, Speaker A: L two centralization, like centralization of layer two protocols.
01:00:28.908 - 01:00:30.576, Speaker C: Winner take all effects in L two.
01:00:30.598 - 01:01:13.544, Speaker A: S. Well, I guess you have to be clear about what you mean, right? Because one of them is like, oh, what if fuel gets 95% of the market share, but Fuel becomes super decentralized and then basically have this weird kind of awkward two layer ethereum distinction, but then the other one is like, well, what if there's like five different roll ups, but the sequencers are all run by one guy? The good news about layer two is even the worst outcomes are not as actually necessarily that bad. Right. Because you still have trustlessness. As long as the L two S are designed correctly, you still have censorship. Resistance. Probably the biggest risk is like, governance capture.
01:01:13.544 - 01:01:25.316, Speaker A: Like, what if the L2 has governance and it does a governance vote and there's too much network effects for people to actually be willing to exit if the governance turns it into something trusted, for example, are you worried about.
01:01:25.418 - 01:01:30.756, Speaker C: That influencing layer one design in a way that you would not intend? Or just l two.
01:01:30.778 - 01:02:13.744, Speaker A: Is influencing layer one design possible? I definitely do think that application layers things. It's not necessarily all governance. It's not just an L two problem. It's something that could happen in so many different ways. Right. There's going to be a lot of conflicts of interest between different kinds of applications on mean you could go all the way dystopian and know is there going to be some major centralized stablecoin that starts lobbying for the base layer to have KYC, which I feel like that one is a bit too blatant and I think too many people would just resist that one very quickly. But there's all kinds of things like that.
01:02:13.744 - 01:02:26.760, Speaker A: So I think the answer isn't so much worrying about one specific interest as it is about making sure that the governance as a whole is secure against those kinds of social attacks from all possible concentrated interests.
01:02:28.700 - 01:02:32.580, Speaker C: Last one. Private keys. Underrated or overrated?
01:02:32.660 - 01:02:57.836, Speaker A: Oh, underrated. I mean, use freaking trying to ban people from having their own personal wallets. Like, come on. Yeah, I think personal wallets where you actually control your private key or it's a social recovery or multi SIG wallet and your family controls some of the keys. That kind of cyber self sovereignty is, I think, like a really important bedrock of having a decentralized crypto ecosystem.
01:02:58.028 - 01:02:59.708, Speaker C: Even with account abstraction?
01:02:59.884 - 01:03:24.184, Speaker A: Even with account abstraction, yes. I think smart contract wallets are not about giving up control. They're about being able to actually choose who to trust, who you can recover. And these things don't even multisig wallets. And social recovery does not have to mean centralization. As I said, you can choose five different friends who don't know each other and have them be your recovery guardians. I actually recommend this.
01:03:24.184 - 01:03:40.270, Speaker A: Right? So there's a lot that you can do with that, but anything like that is far better than an ecosystem where almost all users just interact with the blockchain through a centralized provider where they don't actually control their own access.
01:03:40.820 - 01:03:49.490, Speaker C: Yeah, I think permissionless needs to be truly permissionless. How were the last two years for you with COVID And.
01:03:53.720 - 01:04:44.080, Speaker A: Definitely the kind of mandatory break of my usual schedule was definitely kind of interesting and fascinating in that before COVID I was basically on a plane on average once every six days. I literally have tracking. And that was my life between about 2014 and 2019. And that obviously had to cut down completely. I was basically holed up in Singapore for about most of a year in the middle of that, and I ended up walking to every district in Singapore. It's a nice small city state, 700 and I think 18 or something square kilometers, I think. Was it somewhere around like 300 Freedom units? A bit less, but yeah, Singapore is nice.
01:04:44.080 - 01:05:16.476, Speaker A: You could actually do literal cross country running there. It was also just a good opportunity to kind of think about things, just get quiet, work done. But at the same time, also definitely a lot of inconveniences and a lot of serious stuff that I would have rather not had. There were definitely family members that I was just not able to see for a whole year, which I think was really unfortunate and definitely did you pick.
01:05:16.498 - 01:05:17.496, Speaker C: Up any new hobbies?
01:05:17.608 - 01:05:22.000, Speaker A: Did I pick up any new hobbies? I listened to a lot of podcasts.
01:05:23.940 - 01:05:26.640, Speaker C: Any favorites that you want to mean?
01:05:26.710 - 01:05:38.550, Speaker A: Hardcore History was a fun one. Lex Friedman's are a lot of them are very good. There's also Alex friedman's about history. And there's Alex Friedman with the guy who does Hardcore history.
01:05:40.680 - 01:05:41.648, Speaker C: In action.
01:05:41.824 - 01:06:01.032, Speaker A: You can go meta on this quite a bit, but since then it's like, I think definitely so nice to actually be able to also see people in person and see all of the old friends again that I missed for such a long time.
01:06:01.086 - 01:06:25.280, Speaker C: I think that's one of the really interesting pieces for us today too. There's hundreds of people that have participated at the Youth Global events for the last two years, which we've never met. And we're seeing so many of them come to us and say hi and us knowing that, including some of the global employees and team members, we've never seen them until now. And it's awesome to see that. So I'm really glad to hear that. Today is the 22 April. How was your 420?
01:06:25.430 - 01:07:02.690, Speaker A: Oh, let's see. 420 is an important day because 420 is let me explain it. It's the smallest number which is divisible by all the integers from one to seven. It's also the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. So very meaningful number. But anyway, what did I do? I went to a mini internal Ethereum Foundation research workshop and listens to Mary Mallor do an excellent job explaining secrets. A single secret leader election sounds awesome.
01:07:04.900 - 01:07:18.036, Speaker C: We've talked enough about the past eats two, the merge, let's talk about E three. What's coming, what are some interesting problems and what's something exciting that we can share here?
01:07:18.058 - 01:08:03.170, Speaker A: Well, remember, there is no E two and there's definitely no E three. There is the merge, the surge, the verge, the purge and the splurge. Right. So the merge we know is completing the switch to proof of stake. The surge, massive increase in scaling because of layer twos and sharding. So we talked about Dank sharding, a lot of progress on layer twos here and that's something that we've really seen kind of become alive over the last year or so, right? Like we've basically gone from StarkNet and optimism and arbitram and most of these kind of being theoretical to really being live. I mean, some of them have been around for much longer than a year, right? But it does really feel like the last year has been this amazing and huge tipping point.
01:08:03.170 - 01:08:40.044, Speaker A: So the surge like really getting kind of the scalability vision kind of fully complete. It is progressing. Right. I think very recently optimism added in support for a compression and that noticeably decreased transaction fees by I think like another something like was it like somewhere between 25 and 40%? Almost half, yeah. So that's amazing. And there are going to be more and more of these, right? Eventually replace ECDSA with something else and that can add a lot more compression. Eventually proto dink sharding a lot more and then full dink sharding a lot more.
01:08:40.044 - 01:09:23.288, Speaker A: So I think we're going to see transaction fees on roll ups continue taking steps further and further down over the next couple of years and that'll be amazing. The Verge this is the switch to vertical trees. Vertical trees are important because they enable stateless clients, which basically means you can verify the chain basically without having anything in your hard drive. Like you could just verify any random individual block you want without having preexisting information about what happened in the previous block. And that's really important, right, basically because it makes it much easier to run a validator. It's very good for proof of stake decentralization. It also means that we don't have to worry about the size of the state for a long time.
01:09:23.288 - 01:10:04.996, Speaker A: There's always these concerns about oh, are we going to implement state rents and do we have to do that? What happens when the state blows up to a terabyte? But if you have proposer builder separation so we can allow block building to become more specialized market while validators don't even have to run any state at all, they just verify stainless blocks. Then even the state being a terabyte in size is actually manageable. Right. So Virtue is going to do a lot of good things. Then there is the purge and the purge is basically eliminating cruft. So we talked about EIP four four, four nodes not having the store history anymore. There's like the very long term vision of eventually doing state expiry.
01:10:04.996 - 01:10:43.940, Speaker A: So eventually we can also allow even builders to not store old state. Then there is just allowing and making it a norm for Ethereum clients to not have to process and be able to understand. Every single previous version of the protocol is also part of the purge. Simplifying the ethereum protocol. So banning self destruct, maybe getting rid of interplacing the 2300 gas stipend, maybe getting rid of interplacing logs. Because do we really need in protocol bloom filters when basically no one uses that infrastructure and everyone is using the graph anyway? Right?
01:10:44.090 - 01:10:45.220, Speaker C: Archive notes will.
01:10:45.290 - 01:11:15.392, Speaker A: Exactly. At some point I think you do have to sort of ask that question. What other things are there just a lot of simplifications in the Ethereum protocol that I think can be made and that I think should be made. And the purge is all of that. And then the splurge is basically all of the other cool stuff, right? So account abstraction is really big important. Proposal builder separation is really important. And there is this adding VDFS to increase the security of node validator stat is also really important.
01:11:15.392 - 01:11:51.176, Speaker A: So a lot of really nice things. And also there is I guess you could put this in the merge bucket because it's also proof of stake. But this longer term idea of moving to single slot finality. So instead of blocks finalizing after two and a half epochs, blocks finalize immediately in the next slot. And this has a bunch of important benefits. There's a bunch of technical reasons why actually it might be easier than we thought. And over the last year or so, we've discovered that there are a lot of just inherent complexities that are difficult to work around.
01:11:51.358 - 01:11:53.512, Speaker C: How do you think about reorgs in that world? I'm just curious.
01:11:53.576 - 01:12:27.780, Speaker A: Yeah, so the point is that reorgs would do not exist unless you're in the special case where a large portion of nodes are offline and so you're not finalizing. If most of the nodes are online, then you're finalizing. So you can't have reorgs. That's like the big benefit. Right. So the thing that we realized over the last year is that there actually are a lot of unavoidable complexities and room for bugs in the way that we combine fork choice rules and finality today. So moving to single slot just reduces the number of protocols from two to one and it just makes things so much simpler, potentially.
01:12:27.860 - 01:12:29.320, Speaker C: That'd be huge. That's awesome.
01:12:29.470 - 01:12:33.864, Speaker A: Yeah. Sorry, are we I'm done there.
01:12:33.902 - 01:13:02.928, Speaker C: Okay, final question. We've been part of Ethereum for the last seven years. The bitcoin and just the cryptocurrency ecosystem is around for a little over a decade. How has that evolved from your perspective? The space, whether we're talking about the research or the community or just overall the blockchain space, give us what the last five to ten years have been and kind of how do you see this moving forward for the next five to ten years?
01:13:03.094 - 01:13:23.972, Speaker A: I think the crypto space today is just so different from what it was ten years ago or even five years ago. There's aspects of the old space that I really miss. I definitely miss how it was this kind of very small and niche thing that most people didn't really know about. And even people who did know about it kind of thought that it was a sideshow.
01:13:24.036 - 01:13:34.350, Speaker C: There's an anecdote. Our last event was ETH, London, two years ago. Two years and like, a month ago. And we were struggling to make that a full house. And that capacity was 300 people.
01:13:35.360 - 01:14:21.150, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. There were definitely these kind of very mysterious and undiscovered aspects of it. Even visiting China and discovering this kind of dark forest of various 16 year olds who have actually been mining bitcoin for four years, ended up already being multimillionaires and quitting high school. There's just, like, a lot of libertarians and socialists peacefully arguing with each other on bitcoin talk and, like, having, like, actually fascinating highbrow conversations. Sometime around this time, I think, is like the 10th anniversary of either the Pirate at 40 hack or Bitcoinica, or maybe both. Like, I forget, who here remembers Pirate at 40? Wow.
01:14:21.150 - 01:14:26.060, Speaker A: Who here remembers Bitcoinica? Zotong.
01:14:28.400 - 01:14:30.104, Speaker C: Give us a little bit of background.
01:14:30.232 - 01:15:17.736, Speaker A: I think it was like the first Bitcoin leverage trading platform. It ended up just getting hacked over and over again, and eventually it just didn't have any money and lots of people got angry. And Pirate at 40 was an anonymous guy running basically like a fund, which was like a way of investing in some bitcoin related stuff and getting I think it was like, 7% weekly profits. The guy basically said, like, hey, trust me. And a bunch of people did trust him. And you know what Mark what Mark Zuckerberg said 20 years ago about people who trust him? So this guy was anonymous. He basically just ended up just like, oh, no, he actually did get caught and he did go to jail eventually.
01:15:17.736 - 01:15:28.944, Speaker A: But there's just such crazy stuff happened back then. I mean, I guess these days we have different versions of that. We don't have that sort of stuff.
01:15:28.982 - 01:15:31.212, Speaker C: Severity has been slightly minimized.
01:15:31.276 - 01:16:37.504, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it's like the sizes, like, the dollar amounts of crazy stuff that happens are, I think, about the same, but as they have been all along. But as a percentage of the ecosystem, it's definitely much smaller. And I definitely think that's good, right? So it's definitely good that the ecosystem has matured, and it's definitely grown a lot. People understand a lot, like, what actually can be done, what can't be done, what kinds of things make sense in terms of scalability, in terms of privacy, in terms of all of these issues. So I think over the next five to ten years, we're going to see the continuation of that process and we're going to see a lot of crypto applications continue to turn into something that's really mainstream and I think there are going to be some costs to that. I think the aspect of the crypto space being this frontier, I don't think that's going to go away. I think crypto is just so hard to control that there's always going to be a frontier within crypto but it's not going to be the case that all of crypto is a frontier anymore.
01:16:37.504 - 01:16:45.288, Speaker A: Right, but at the same time it's hopefully going to be something that just the lots of people use as a.
01:16:45.294 - 01:16:53.564, Speaker C: Regular part of their lives and it's a good future. Before we end, any predictions for what the next fu years look like?
01:16:53.762 - 01:17:09.600, Speaker A: Oh, the ethereum price will be 12,000, but I won't tell you in what currency could be bolivars, Venezuelan, or it could be doge.
01:17:10.340 - 01:17:12.416, Speaker C: You won't tell us what currency or what base?
01:17:12.518 - 01:18:20.888, Speaker A: Exactly? Yes, and I will tell you if that's 1000 in base ten or base three. So what are the predictions? Basically I think scaling and zero knowledge and smart contract wallets and all that stuff are going to be mature and the ecosystem will then have to basically either succeed on its ability to actually deliver on the applications that people have been expecting for so long or it'll not do that or something in the middle. I do think that blockchains have already proven that they are here to stay and that they do have some value. But there is still this question of like well in what places exactly how much? Are we talking the new windows of finance or are we talking the Linux of finance and not just for finance? How does that end up playing out in every other industry? So no, I mean it's still a lot of things that remain open and undecided but I think all of the lovely hackers at the hackathon here can do a lot to try to help make the more positive outcomes happen.
01:18:21.054 - 01:18:52.630, Speaker C: It's a perfect note to end this on. Thank you so much and let's give him a big round of applause. All right, well, hope you all enjoyed that. So a couple of things to go. We're going to cover the logistics for how the weekend is going to work, especially for all of you that are hacking. I'm going to talk about all the things that we have planned and let's go right into it. So there's a few things.
01:18:52.630 - 01:19:40.230, Speaker C: So the first one is we're going to talk about how you can get help, which is how discord is set up all the prizes you're going to win. As a quick note for all of the partners that are coming on stage to talk about their prizes, please go onto my left and your right. Right now we're going to get that set up. We're going to also talk about how judging is going to work and also, if you're still looking for a team, the team formation is going to happen right behind me on my left, your right, right after we finish the ceremonies. So everything in terms of official communication will be on Discord. That means if something is due as a deadline or we have an announcement or something is not on schedule, we'll be communicating that with everybody on Discord. If you're not already on Discord, you can head over to ETHGlobal Chat and it'll redirect you to the event Discord.
01:19:40.230 - 01:20:14.222, Speaker C: On top of that, everything is a channel under the ETH Amsterdam category. So if you are on Discord and you don't see the word ETH Amsterdam on the left sidebar, find one of us in the venue and we will make sure you have the right permissions. And this is where you can talk to any of our partners, any of our mentors, hear all the announcements, and especially as we get to judging on Sunday, any updates around there will be communicating on Discord. On top of that, you're all here in person. Just talk to each other in person. Walk up to us if you can't get an answer. If you know somebody it looks like, go up to them.
01:20:14.222 - 01:20:47.900, Speaker C: Definitely engage in a meaningful and in a comfortable way. And also, if you need help with something that you're stuck on, whether it's a bug, you can absolutely stand up and shout, asking, does anybody know how to fix this? All these things are very much possible. And on top of that, there are a lot of workshops and talks happening. So the first set of workshop blocks starts at 09:00 P.m., and they're all on the second floor over there. So to my right and your left, you should have also gone a calendar invite for a lot of these talks. And if you ever want to know what's going on, the latest schedule is always on the website.
01:20:47.900 - 01:21:29.510, Speaker C: So how does the hackathon work? Hackathon officially begins now, which means you can start working on your projects. And a lot of you have already gotten this started, but you can have your team set up and you can work with up to five members per team. You don't necessarily have to work on a team. It's totally okay if you are planning on working on your own and using that as an opportunity to learn. So please make sure that your team members are listed on your dashboard, because if they are not listed there, we will have no other records of those people on your submission. And if you win a prize that will not be distributed to the people that are not listed on your dashboard, you have 36 hours to hack, which means the deadline is 09:00 A.m. On Sunday.
01:21:29.510 - 01:21:54.942, Speaker C: That's when the submission forms will close, and we'll begin judging shortly after. And I'll walk through how all of that is set up. Simple rules and criteria for the hackathon. Everything that you're going to do and submit should be done over the course of this weekend, which means you cannot continue working on a project that you've been working on before. It is okay to use boilerplate codes. If you purchase some templates to make the design easier, that is okay. If you want to fork an existing project, that is okay.
01:21:54.942 - 01:22:28.614, Speaker C: If you want to fork your own project that you're working on the side from a week ago, that is not okay. But make sure you are working on something that you are starting today. There are definitely some nuances there, so if you think you're one of the edge cases, come find any of us in person. We'll assess that and talk to you about it. But please make sure that if you win any prizes, we will verify everybody's code base before delivering them to you. So do not make any attempts to cheat. Simple stuff again, which is if you are not listed on the team, which means you were not RSV and confirmed as a hacker, you will not be eligible to win any prizes.
01:22:28.614 - 01:22:50.254, Speaker C: And of course, just one more time. Any questions, send us an email. Ask us on discord. Find me or anybody else on our team in person and ask the questions right away. Lots of incredible workshops and talks. 40 of them are happening in short bursts of time. There'll be about 30 of them happening in the next 5 hours up on the second floor and a few more tomorrow morning and tomorrow afternoon.
01:22:50.254 - 01:23:20.714, Speaker C: The whole schedule is on the website and everything in terms of details is listed on your info center, which is on your dashboard as well as on your calendar invites. Also, we don't want you all to be fully up and watching everything all the time. So everything is also recorded if you miss something. Especially for people who are on the live stream that want to catch up on. Some of the content. You can catch up on that on YouTube directly by heading over to Youtube.com ETHGlobal and to see the schedule and the prizes and everything else, you can head over to Amsterdam Ethglobal.com
01:23:20.714 - 01:23:41.934, Speaker C: or just go to Ethglobal.com and click on Ethamsterdam onto the submissions. Submissions are due at 09:00 A.m., which means that at 09:00 A.m., the page that lets you submit your project will automatically close. So please do not miss that deadline. Of course, if something goes wrong on the technical standpoint, if it breaks, we'll obviously extend that deadline.
01:23:41.934 - 01:24:06.786, Speaker C: But you have 37 hours from now to submit and work on a project. The way judging is going to work is going to be really important. There's a lot of people, there's a lot of projects, and we have a short amount of time to go through all the projects for submission. So there's going to be a lot of paralyzation. There's going to be eight rooms that are going to be doing the main. Judging. So as soon as you submit, a few minutes later, you'll be assigned a room which will appear on your dashboard.
01:24:06.786 - 01:24:48.146, Speaker C: So all you have to do is press, just refresh however many times you would like until things start showing up and you will know exactly what room you need to go to and you'll see a set of judges there. And the same format works, which is you have about four minutes to present your project. And I'll get into that in a second. But judging begins 30 minutes after the submission deadline, so everybody will go there while that is happening. The prize judging is also going to happen at the same window. So depending on what room you're assigned, you will also be given an order, which means if you're one of the later ones in that room, you have the first hour or two free. You can then come down and talk to the sponsor you wanted to present your prize to and demo it to them individually.
01:24:48.146 - 01:25:21.134, Speaker C: So if you applied for five different prizes, you're going to have to go to five of those companies and tell them what you did. So make sure you time it yourself and then you can go up and go to the main judging. We'll share a lot more on that today and tomorrow and email and everywhere else. So don't worry if you missed any of this. And the way project submissions work is you will have four minutes to demo. There is an option to record a video demo, especially as when you're doing a live demo, things can go wrong or things may take too much time for your transactions to confirm if you're doing something on main net. So we just recommend you record a four minute video as well, which you can play if something goes wrong.
01:25:21.134 - 01:26:07.220, Speaker C: Please don't do this thing last minute. There's there's a couple of big questions around. Tell us how you did it, how things work, which require slightly longer answers. Either prep them ahead of time or make sure that you are kind of paralyzing that work on your team. So somebody can fill out the screenshot, somebody can fill out the video, somebody can fill out the long description, somebody can pick all the prizes, just make sure all those things are counted for because it will take you more than ten minutes to make everything right for the submission. And all the details must be on your dashboard, which means that if you are applying for a prize and you forget to select that, nobody will know that you apply for this prize. So there's no way we can communicate that to all of our partners to have them say, expect these companies or projects or know that you are choosing to submit and demo your project.
01:26:07.220 - 01:26:33.926, Speaker C: So I said a couple of these things already, but when you are done with your main judging, you can come down and find the sponsor you're trying to present to and demo your projects to them as well. So this can be before or after or at any time. Code of conduct. Very simple. We have a code of conduct that defines how you should behave in this building, especially over this weekend. All the rules are defined on Ethglobal.com rules.
01:26:33.926 - 01:27:21.066, Speaker C: It talks about how you should treat everybody here. The answer is, please be respectful for everybody else and harassment will not be tolerated in any form. If you think somebody is behaving the way they shouldn't, please let us know and we'll be able to act immediately. In terms of intellectual property, anything that you build is solely owned by you, and it's up to you to do whatever you'd like with it. And of course, if there's anything else that comes up, if you have any questions, if you have any edge cases, some of you have to check in early or late or you have to leave because you have a flight on Sunday, let us know. We can figure out how to accommodate everybody, but just want to make sure that everybody is comfortable over this weekend on to some of the amazing prizes. So we're going to bring on some of our partners here, and they're going to come here, talk about who they are, why they're excited to be here, and what prizes they're giving.
01:27:21.066 - 01:27:37.840, Speaker C: So let's welcome our very first partner today, Gearbox. And there's Mikhail. And this is a special moment for us because Mikhail was one of the winners of Market Make a year ago as a project that came out of Ethg Global and they're giving back to the community. And I'm super excited to have him here.
01:27:40.210 - 01:28:21.070, Speaker D: Thank you. And hello, S Amsterdam. I'm pretty boring guys, because as a Kartik said, basically, it was only one year ago when Gearbox became a Market Make finalist, and now Gearbox became a sponsor. So, so boring for me personally. And now I really want to say thank you for as Global Family and Kartek personally for support. And this support cover Gearbox for all our story during the hackathon after hackathon. And even now we feel a lot of support and it's great.
01:28:21.070 - 01:28:21.470, Speaker D: So.
01:28:21.540 - 01:28:21.934, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:28:21.972 - 01:28:49.074, Speaker D: As global family. Thank you, Kartik, for that. Let's applaud them. So at this point, it's my personal thoughts. You shouldn't consider this hackathon like, three days event. It could be a really great, life changing event in your life. And I really definitely believe that this supportive culture in crypto is very, very significant for all persons here in Gearbox.
01:28:49.074 - 01:29:34.386, Speaker D: We are building a generic and composable leverage. So it's based on credit account, which is new, defy, primitive. It looks like smart contract wallet, which allows you to take more money and manage them as year round. And Gearbox itself, maybe it's not an end product. We really use other protocols and empower them. So you can combine Gearbox with Uniswap to get margin trading. You can combine Gearbox with Earn to get leverage farming, and you combine Gearbox with Lido and many other protocols for leverage staking and so on and so on and so on.
01:29:34.386 - 01:30:10.590, Speaker D: So mindset today may be the best strategy ever not to try to think how to build next uniswap killer or how to build new competitor to 1inchh. It's much better to think how through composability, we can create totally new way to really link existing protocols, existing ideas to create great experience for users and which help us to attract next billion in crypto industry thank you. And build on gearbox.
01:30:12.230 - 01:30:29.832, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Kelvin from Optimism. Hello. Hi.
01:30:29.886 - 01:31:31.244, Speaker E: My name is or. I work on a project called Optimism, where we are trying to scale ethereum's tech, scale its values, and hopefully provide the funding for its future. We're working on two key projects. I guess we got optimism, the optimistic roll up, and we're also working on a novel funding mechanism called Retroactive Public Goods Funding, where we're trying to fundamentally change how people can get funded within this ecosystem to do all of the work that we desperately need done. We've got some exciting hacks here if people want or some exciting prizes for hacks here we've got, of course, $2,500, a couple of $2,500 bounties for the best optimism ecosystem hacks. So if you just build on Optimism, we've also got $2,500 for the best optimistically ethereum hacks. So just hacks that contribute back to the ethereum ecosystem at large.
01:31:31.244 - 01:31:56.890, Speaker E: So maybe you want to work a little bit on EIP 4844 or something like that. And then, of course, there's some money thrown in there for people who just want to try deploying on optimism. I highly recommend checking out Optimism IO Amsterdam, where you can learn all about optimism and the prizes that we're doing. So if you want to come hang with us, we're near the front.
01:31:57.340 - 01:31:58.088, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:31:58.174 - 01:32:02.168, Speaker E: And public goods are good, fun public goods, or we won't last.
01:32:02.334 - 01:32:10.010, Speaker C: Thanks, Kelvin. Next up we have Sergey from one inch. Welcome, Sergey.
01:32:14.990 - 01:32:44.658, Speaker D: So hi everyone. My name is Sergey. I'm co founder of 1inchh Network. We actually started also in a hackathon back in 2019 on this nice, very nice organized hackathon ath Global. From our point of view, best in the world. We participated more than 17 hackathons around the globe with the team name Cryptomaniacs, and we are staying here as one each network. We invented aggregation among digitalized exchanges back in 2019.
01:32:44.658 - 01:33:22.750, Speaker D: And we have some bonuses for you guys. So we have like 1st, 2nd, 3rd place. You can earn up to $8,000 by just innovating, building something new for DeFi or on top of 1inchh Network, we have multiple protocols, we have limit order protocol. Mm, we have the aggregation protocol, user API. It's very well document described in the documents on 1inchh IO. So thank you very much and have a nice hack.
01:33:31.420 - 01:33:37.100, Speaker C: Next up, we have stani. We have Stani from Ave and Lens protocol. Welcome Stani.
01:33:41.280 - 01:33:42.030, Speaker A: Hello.
01:33:42.560 - 01:34:19.420, Speaker D: So my name is Stani. I'm the founder and CEO of Ave and we're a team that created the Ave Protocol. Essentially you can deposit cryptographic assets and earn interest rates and then take flash loans and hack other protocols. Just kidding, don't hack any protocols. Yeah, also we created Lens Protocol which is a decentralized social graph. Essentially you can create an onchain profile and then you can have a following graph on chain as well. And also you can publish content directly to your followers.
01:34:19.420 - 01:35:47.320, Speaker D: Yeah, so we have two kind of Bounties. So we have one track for the Ave Bounties and essentially we're looking for most innovative products or POCs or whatever you want to call them, build on top of the Aubrey Protocol. And I think we've been doing hackathons and participating since four, three, four years now and we've seen pretty much a lot of interesting innovation and it's very surprising how much creativity there is in this room. So essentially what is innovation? It's pretty much you to decide and craft, but essentially the first price will be seven and a half, $1,000 worth, second is four and a half, third is 3004, is 1000. And anyone who is hacking anything on top of the average protocol is already kind of like a winner in our sense. And we would definitely love to see some kind of like a creativity between the Avi protocol and maybe also with the Lens Protocol, kind of like a moni Legos and social Legos combination. And these prizes are sponsored by the Avegrance Dao which is a subdaw or actually spinoff Dao from the Avidao.
01:35:47.320 - 01:36:57.580, Speaker D: So we also have Bounties for the Lens Protocol and essentially we want to see very interesting ways to interact with the content. That can be some new way to stream and use maybe using Live peer at the same time together with the Lens Protocol and create something amazing, something new that we haven't seen before, or something old that just works better and is more decentralized. So essentially 6000 for the first one and 2000 for the second one. And of course if you hack something on Lens Protocol you will get also some of our swag which are the Lens socks and they're very cool and there's just limited amount. So first will be served. Yeah, and also tooling. So if you see some interesting stuff being built on the tooling side, that's also very appreciated, but really would love to see some very cool front ends being built or can be even games with following logic and so forth.
01:36:57.580 - 01:37:19.072, Speaker D: And of course we have some alpha to leak here. So we have on Sunday the rave party and here's the code. So there's only 25 tickets with this code. So type in let's hack and you maybe get the code if you're fast enough. So I will leave this for you for grabs.
01:37:19.136 - 01:37:19.428, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:37:19.434 - 01:37:20.150, Speaker D: So much.
01:37:24.950 - 01:37:36.310, Speaker C: We'll give you all 5 seconds to snack those tickets. And with that, we are ready for our next sponsor. Please welcome Paige from Livepeer.
01:37:40.090 - 01:38:17.630, Speaker B: Hi, everybody. My name is Paige. I'm from Livepeer. And for those of you who don't know what Livepeer is, Livepeer is a decentralized network providing transcoding capacity. And transcoding capacity is the essential process to deliver live streaming video across the Internet. In addition to providing this transcoding capacity, we also provide a really easy to use API so that you as a developer or a hacker can easily include video in your applications. Both live streaming video or very recently, video on demand.
01:38:17.630 - 01:38:55.306, Speaker B: So already recorded video to create a YouTube like application. And we also have a new video. NFT minting SDK. So you can stream video and Mint NFTs from that streamed video. And we have a few prizes. So Livepeer is sort of a great tool if you're thinking about using video in any capacity in your hack. It's specifically for creator applications, social media or gaming.
01:38:55.306 - 01:39:38.922, Speaker B: And so that's our top prize. So $6,000 for the best a killer video centric social media, creator or gaming application. Our second prize at 4000 is the best use of the NFT video Minting SDK. What creative apps can you make that use? Mint NFTs video NFTs. And our SDK is available on our Hacker Quickstart Guide, which is linked in our sponsor channel. And then the best video on demand application like YouTube. There's so many interesting things that we can do in Web Three to create the next YouTube competitor or Web Three YouTube using our VOD MVP.
01:39:38.922 - 01:40:01.970, Speaker B: What can you build? So that prize is at 4000 and then the best application of Live peer in the Metaverse. We've seen cool applications of streaming into the Metaverse or out of the Metaverse or videos in the Metaverse. This is a fun one. So what can you use Livepeer in the Metaverse for? And with that thank you so much. We're here to help you. We have a booth. We're here to help you.
01:40:02.040 - 01:40:02.586, Speaker C: IRL.
01:40:02.638 - 01:40:09.160, Speaker B: Come talk to us. We'd love to talk to you about your projects, help you hack or hit us up in the discord. Thanks so much.
01:40:10.650 - 01:40:15.850, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Next up, we have Pedro from Wallet Connect. Please welcome Pedro on stage.
01:40:17.630 - 01:40:40.330, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming for my workshop earlier. And I hope you guys learn how to use wallconnect. If you don't, we're over there in the corner so you guys can learn more about us. Obviously, Wallet Connect connects wallets, and if you do integrate into your DAP, you are eligible for our bounty. We created two tracks because we want to see more social projects.
01:40:40.330 - 01:41:16.798, Speaker D: We love the D five projects. We want to make sure that social projects get the chance to also have their own bounties. So we have 4000 for the first one, 2000 for the second one, and 1000 for the third. One on separate tracks. We want to see a lot of DFI cross chain projects, and we also want to see the social and identity projects, and we also have a pool price for honorable mentions at 2000. They're going to be split for other projects that we find that are great. And as well, at Connect, we always like to see projects that are very interoperable and use standards, so make sure to really make us happy.
01:41:16.798 - 01:41:21.920, Speaker D: So I look forward to see your projects, and I'll judge them on Sunday. Thank you.
01:41:24.050 - 01:41:28.370, Speaker C: Amazing. Thank you so much. Next up, we have scale.
01:41:31.100 - 01:41:54.616, Speaker F: Awesome. All right, hello, everybody. Christine from Scale labs here. Excited to be here at East Amsterdam with all of you. And I want to talk about the prizes first because we're really excited for hackers to hack on scale. We have $16,000 worth of prizes and scale bounties. The five K will go to the best use case on the scale network, and then the middle two are going to split the prizes.
01:41:54.616 - 01:42:32.292, Speaker F: So if you build in one of these categories, you will split between five K or two k each. And again, there's a 4K prize pool divided among all teams that simply just hack on scale. Now, what is the scale network? We are a layer that sits on top of Ethereum that helps remove gas costs but also speeds up transactions. What's great is that it works really well within the Ethereum ecosystem. So all the tools that you love on Ethereum will work seamlessly on scale as well. So there are nodes around the world that operate in a proof of stake manner. And when you decide that you want a scale chain, we group together a subset of those, and that subset creates your scale chain.
01:42:32.292 - 01:43:15.064, Speaker F: But it doesn't do just processing transactions. You can also use file storage, which allows you to save files directly to the blockchain, or an interchange messaging agent, which allows you to transfer assets back and forth between Ethereum. Now, this is one of many, so one of the first multi chain architectures out there. And what that means right now is what's really cool is we're launching the scaleverse, which basically means that we're creating organization within this multi chain architecture. So applications are coming together to create Exchange Hubs, NFT Hubs, community chains, but you can also still get your own dedicated chain that's able to talk to each other within the ecosystem. All right, now back to the prizes. If you want to hack with us, definitely scan the QR code here.
01:43:15.064 - 01:43:20.456, Speaker F: We'll give you all the information or just simply enter this URL directly in your browser. All right, thanks, guys.
01:43:20.558 - 01:43:21.240, Speaker A: Bye.
01:43:22.240 - 01:43:30.780, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Next up, we have Tatum. Please welcome Samuel on stage.
01:43:31.600 - 01:43:55.284, Speaker G: Hey, guys. I'm super excited to be here. I'm Sam CTO and co founder of Tatum. I'm going to tell you what Tatum actually is. Tatum is a developer framework which helps you developers build the blockchain apps and scale them super fast and super simple. You can build any app you want on any chain we support. You don't have to understand how Node or Solidity works.
01:43:55.284 - 01:44:18.620, Speaker G: You don't have to be blockchain expert. You can just leverage ready to use features in your app. We provide. Datum consists of more than 300 features. You can just plug them in and you can just build what you can do with us. You can do anything. You can do any application you want on any chain you want.
01:44:18.620 - 01:44:54.330, Speaker G: You can create wallets, you can use directrpc calls. You can mint NFTs. If you don't know how to work with Solidity and you know how to create smart contracts, we got you covered. We have ready made templates for you where you just on one line of code. You deploy your NFT or smart contract of your choice to any of the supported chains. We support more than 40 different blockchain protocols. If you want to read the data from the chain, if you want to perform thousands of transactions per second and scale beyond the blockchain limitations, our offchain features are there for you.
01:44:54.330 - 01:45:27.388, Speaker G: Right now, more than 50,000 companies and one of the biggest projects in the world are using Tatum. So if you want to test it out, it's easy. Just sign up to Tatum IO, get a free API key, and start building. We're having a workshop today, which you are all invited. I'm going to very quickly show you how to start in 15 minutes. We have some nice pool prizes for some of the best projects NFDS, some virtual accounts. Whatever you want to build, we are here to help you.
01:45:27.388 - 01:45:31.670, Speaker G: So sign up and build. Thank you guys.
01:45:33.640 - 01:45:38.820, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Next up, we have Evan from Mina. Please welcome Evan on stage.
01:45:40.840 - 01:46:20.972, Speaker H: Hey, everyone, I'm Evan. I'm one of the co founders of Mina protocol. So Mina is this protocol where we put zero knowledge proofs kind of in the heart of it, which both means that it's very easy to verify and good to program zero knowledge proofs with. So in particular, it can be very cheaply verified with these zero knowledge proofs on your browser, on your phone, or even inside smart contracts on other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, we've also unlocked some very good zero knowledge proof programming functionality. It's all in TypeScript and you cannot only access the scale functionality, but you can also access privacy. So you can natively program with privacy zero knowledge proofs in TypeScript.
01:46:20.972 - 01:47:02.480, Speaker H: If you're like a TypeScript developer, you can use this without being a cryptographer. So that's really so one of the things we're going to do with this is we're working to make Mina Verifiable inside of an EVM smart contract, which will let you do your privacy and scaling part of your application inside Mina. And then the rest of your application can just stay on Ethereum. So if you've wanted to use privacy but you're not going to build an entire side chain or become a cryptographer and you want to just use TypeScript and get going with it. You can use Mina for that. We had a workshop earlier today that talked about how you can program with zero knowledge proofs and Mina. It happened earlier, so if you missed it, you can actually see it online.
01:47:02.480 - 01:47:12.500, Speaker H: There's going to be a video up soon on the ETH Amsterdam page. I'm going to hand it over to Jack now from o of one labs. One another. Mina Protocol Ecosystem Company. He'll talk more about the prizes.
01:47:16.140 - 01:47:16.504, Speaker D: Hi.
01:47:16.542 - 01:47:18.072, Speaker H: I'm Jack and I do developer relations.
01:47:18.126 - 01:47:19.172, Speaker D: At O One Labs.
01:47:19.236 - 01:48:06.170, Speaker H: And we've sent the last Owen Labs is the company that incubated the Mina protocol. So we spent the last year building out Snarky JS so that you can build a whole new class of decentralized applications in simple Idiomatic TypeScript. We call these ZK apps and they expose a whole host of zero knowledge primitives that are really powerful so that you can build a whole new kind of game, or roll up, or privacy preserving application, whatever you want. We have prizes at 8000, 5000 and $3,000 for 1st, second and third place respectively. And as long as you build something that relates to Mina, you should be eligible. Infrastructure and integration are both fair game. If you do choose to build a zero knowledge app, I recommend that you build something kind of simple that makes use of the unique properties of Mina and Snarky JS in a clever way.
01:48:06.170 - 01:48:17.948, Speaker H: If you need help, reach out to somebody in a hoodie like mine, or even if you just want to say hi. Most of us are core devs at Mina Foundation or Owen Labs. And if you build something really cool, or maybe if you build something at.
01:48:17.954 - 01:48:19.048, Speaker D: All, we'll give you a hoodie.
01:48:19.144 - 01:48:21.740, Speaker H: Other than that, thank you so much and good luck.
01:48:23.840 - 01:48:29.840, Speaker C: Thank you. Mina protocol. Next up, we have IPFS and filecoin. Please welcome Constantine on stage.
01:48:30.580 - 01:49:18.944, Speaker D: Hello everyone. My name is Constantine and I'm having a pleasure to welcome you from IPFS and Filecoin. Side what an amazing time to be here in If Amsterdam to meet with all of you hacking in person for the next few days. First of all, without further ado, IPFS is the protocol which makes the web peer to peer. It makes it resilient, accessible and scalable for the future applications. Moreover, we have a file coin which is built on top of IPFS, which serves you with the largest data storage provider on the web, free, and allows you to have your data being resilient and reliable all the time when you need it. Moreover, our ecosystem is the strongest asset in growing the filecoin network and web free in general.
01:49:18.944 - 01:50:24.484, Speaker D: On one side, we have a rapidly expanding storage capacity of the network with more than 4000 of storage providers available to you right now and more than 18 xbytes of total storage capacity in the network right now. On the other side, we have an increasing demand from the explosively growing ecosystem with more than 300 startups working on different topics in IPFS and Filecoin and more than 9000 developers contributing to our protocols day to day from all over the world. We are more than just a storage though. We are also building new solutions to enable compute on the filecoin. We are developing a new layer of programmability via Filecoin virtual machine and we are also joining our effort to make Filecoin provably green and this all becomes the foundation of the web free being sustainable, reliable, storage, compute and much much more in the network. Moreover, during the hack you can see or find us during the workshops at nine. Today I'll be given an introduction for IPFS and File coin and book your time tomorrow at 01:00 P.m.
01:50:24.484 - 01:51:33.380, Speaker D: When our CEO and founder Juan Bennett will be giving you a talk on regenerating crypto economics for good. I would wish you all to get creative and good luck. Have fun. And for those of you who are doing the best of the best projects and available and building the web free future together with us, we are preparing the amazing prizes with a pool of award you and the challenge. To participate in our challenge, you have to fulfill the very simple criteria of building together with IPFS for content addressing and filecoin for decentralized storage or any solution that builds on top of either for you. For the quick start we have prepared many tools and guides but you can scan the QR code or feel free also to follow the NFT storage which can give you an immediate hands up within given a few minutes to freely store your NFTs on IPFS and Filecoin. You can also use Webfree Storage for storing all free things and you can use Fleek for also hosting your website directly on IPFS making and ensuring that your website and content on the web is reliably stored for whenever you want it.
01:51:33.380 - 01:51:41.950, Speaker D: I would wish you all great success and enjoy your time at the hackathon. Congratulations and good luck on the hack. Thank you a lot.
01:51:46.480 - 01:52:13.092, Speaker C: Amazing. Well, he's tall. Next up, we have polygon. So Polygon wasn't able to make it here because of a travel minor issue, but I'll read off their prizes really quickly. So Polygon is giving a lot of prizes. So you have $15,000 in prizes and the first place for an open track of best use of Polygon integration will receive $5,000. The second place will receive 3000 and the third place is going to receive $2,000.
01:52:13.092 - 01:52:35.500, Speaker C: And they have two separate tracks. One for the best DAP incorporating Polygon affinity design system that will win $2,500 and the second trap of best app incorporating Polygon ID in their hack that's also going to receive $2,500. All right, with that we are ready for our next sponsor and that is skill Wallet. Please welcome Alex on stage from Skill Wallet.
01:52:38.640 - 01:53:01.200, Speaker D: Hello, everyone. So this is Alex and the co founder of Skill Wallet. We have a self sovereign identity protocol that binds together the individuals with the communities that they join and rewards them based on their participation. Now, as for our prizes, once the slides arrive, we have in total 8000 USDCs as rewards.
01:53:01.360 - 01:53:03.140, Speaker A: Can you please reach the slide?
01:53:05.260 - 01:53:44.556, Speaker D: So we have two main tracks. They will appear. And the main one is the ID activist is for building something interesting on public goods, for creativity and less coding. So you can use our protocol to build a brand new app and some new use case, for example, in profit sharing. The second one is a feature track. It's a little bit more techy, and you can play directly with our protocol to add a new feature that you don't have, or for example, something that experiments with new models of governance, like participation weighted voting. So we also have a pool price that is in total 1000 USDC.
01:53:44.556 - 01:53:54.020, Speaker D: Whatever you do, Skill Wallet just F one, integrate it and you will take a share of the pool. So act, have fun and enjoy your weekend.
01:53:54.100 - 01:53:54.808, Speaker C: We are there.
01:53:54.894 - 01:53:55.800, Speaker D: Bye bye.
01:53:59.660 - 01:54:02.900, Speaker C: Next up, we have Rafael from Toucan.
01:54:03.060 - 01:54:19.628, Speaker D: Hey, everybody. So I'm Rafael, CEO and founder of Toucan. And funnily enough, Toucan was started at East London two years ago and now we're here. So big. Thank you to East Global. You're doing amazing work. Token is empowering Web Three to address climate change.
01:54:19.628 - 01:54:52.040, Speaker D: So we do that by building building blocks. Essentially, that tokenize carbon credits and allow other people to build on top of liquid carbon credits to do it like in Metaverse and NFT, use carbon as a collateral asset in lending stablecoins, et cetera. So really, it's the bet on you people to build crazy stuff with carbon. And to lead by example, we've actually offset this event so you can eat and drink as much as you want. And there is also $8,000 up for grabs and prices, I don't know if they show.
01:54:52.110 - 01:54:52.488, Speaker C: Perfect.
01:54:52.574 - 01:55:14.930, Speaker D: So we have five devs here that can support you at any point in the night, in the morning. So the booth is right here if you need help for building with carbon. And, yeah, like everyone in Web Three, obviously we're hiring. And yeah, if you want to work on something cool that has meaningful impact, then please talk to us.
01:55:16.020 - 01:55:21.040, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Next up, we have Fran from Superfluid. Welcome, Fran on stage.
01:55:22.340 - 01:55:23.408, Speaker D: Hello everyone.
01:55:23.574 - 01:55:47.892, Speaker H: Super excited to be here. Last time I was on stage at If, Global was EF London as a hacker. So it's amazing to be here as a sponsor in Studs, and hopefully I'm going to help you guys to win a prize. So Superfluid is an asset streaming protocol. You can make continuous payments without making recurring transactions, and you also don't have any gas fees, so it's. All on chain. It's very programmable.
01:55:47.892 - 01:56:13.668, Speaker H: You can build a ton of really cool stuff and we have a ton of bounties. So there's $8,000 in open bounties. And on top of this, we have a $10,000 bounty with Uma protocol. You can find the details on our Twitter. That's $10,000 bounty for one specific project that's already specked out. So come and hack with us. We have a workshop at 930 in room eight.
01:56:13.668 - 01:56:17.220, Speaker H: Looking forward to seeing everyone and good luck hacking.
01:56:18.040 - 01:56:25.160, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you so much. Next up we have Tom from Tribe Dow. Welcome Tom on stage.
01:56:26.940 - 01:56:28.600, Speaker D: Hi everyone, I'm Tom.
01:56:28.670 - 01:56:30.164, Speaker A: I'm from the tribe dow.
01:56:30.212 - 01:56:32.344, Speaker D: The Tribe Dow is a Dao with.
01:56:32.382 - 01:56:33.588, Speaker A: A set of DeFi protocols.
01:56:33.604 - 01:56:37.630, Speaker D: Inside it. We've got Faye Arari vault, a few others.
01:56:38.960 - 01:56:45.176, Speaker A: This hackathon, we've got three prizes available based on three new things that we recently launched.
01:56:45.288 - 01:56:49.996, Speaker D: Two and a half, $1,000 each one is for Tribe Turbo, which is a.
01:56:50.018 - 01:56:51.228, Speaker A: Way to get a costless line of.
01:56:51.234 - 01:56:52.924, Speaker D: Credit and put it in a yield strategy.
01:56:52.972 - 01:56:55.296, Speaker A: One is for ERC 46 26, which.
01:56:55.318 - 01:56:57.040, Speaker D: Is a tokenized vault standard.
01:56:57.190 - 01:56:58.976, Speaker A: And the last is for Flywheel, which.
01:56:58.998 - 01:57:02.024, Speaker D: Is a generalized way to put incentives into markets.
01:57:02.092 - 01:57:05.536, Speaker A: So yeah, have fun hacking. We did a workshop earlier, so catch.
01:57:05.568 - 01:57:07.332, Speaker D: Up on that and ask me any questions.
01:57:07.466 - 01:57:08.150, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:57:08.600 - 01:57:12.310, Speaker C: Thanks Tom. Next up we have Web three Auth.
01:57:17.260 - 01:58:04.240, Speaker D: Hi, good evening everybody. I'm Elisha and I run operations at Web Three Auth. So we built simple self custodial Auth infrastructure for both webtree applications and wallets. And our goal is really just to replace seed phrases with an MPC enabled multi factor like key and bring the next billion users into this space. So we are built on Threshold cryptography and our onboarding flows emulate something that everyday users are very familiar with, which is really just signing into an SSO like Google, Twitter, email username password on a trusted device without the need for any additional installations. Our keys are self custodial interoperable across devices and platforms to FA capable and user recoverable. Web Three Auth is simple to integrate and it works with MetaMask.
01:58:04.240 - 01:58:29.570, Speaker D: So we are sponsoring $8,000 worth of Bounties for projects that integrate with Web Three Auth and we are looking for exciting projects with exceptional UX and business case. So we've got Devs on site to help you build your DAP with Web Three off in about 20 minutes and we are holding a workshop later at 11:00 p.m. At room two. So catch us at our booth and let's hack something together. Good night guys.
01:58:30.260 - 01:58:35.280, Speaker C: Amazing. Next up we have Simon from Volts. Please welcome Simon on stage.
01:58:37.700 - 01:59:21.532, Speaker D: Hey everyone. So we are Volts and essentially we are an automated market maker for interest rate swaps. So what does that mean in its simplest form? It basically means that you can trade fixed and variable rates with leverage. So again, in the simplest form, think dYdX, but for rates, if you want to learn more about the way the protocol kind of really works. Then make sure you come along to Art and my co founders talk at 10:00 tonight. Otherwise, in terms of prizes, so we have eight k of prizes in total, which breaks down as 4K for the most useful, two and a half k for the most creative, and one and a half K for another qualifying application. If you've got any questions, come over to our booth.
01:59:21.532 - 01:59:24.960, Speaker D: Otherwise, good luck and looking forward to seeing what everyone builds.
01:59:25.380 - 01:59:31.040, Speaker C: Thanks, Simon. Next up, we have George from Tempest. Please welcome George on stage.
01:59:34.900 - 01:59:58.350, Speaker D: GM, everybody. I'm George, co founder of Tempest, and we are currently working on fixing DeFi yields. We have pool of eight k for prizes. We will give five k for the best, and for the second place, we will give three k. Everyone is welcome to build anything back end or front end on top of Tempus. See you around. Enjoy.
02:00:00.240 - 02:00:06.220, Speaker C: Amazing. Next up, Boris from Uniswap Grants Program. Please welcome Boris on stage.
02:00:08.320 - 02:00:45.316, Speaker D: Hey, guys, Boris from the Grants program here. So uniswap decentralized. Mm exchange on ethereum and both Arbitrum optimism and polygon. And yeah, for our challenges, we have best usage of any scaling solution with Uniswap. So you can build something cool either for the existing deployments or you can think outside the box and work with deployments that deploy somewhere where Uniswap currently is not. Anything goes here. And for our second category, we have most innovative Uniswap projects.
02:00:45.316 - 02:00:50.910, Speaker D: So we don't want to limit you. Build whatever you think is cool and it will be great for us. Thank you so much.
02:00:52.880 - 02:00:58.060, Speaker C: Thank you, Boris. Next up, we have Shanna from Coinbase Wallet. Please welcome Shanna on stage.
02:01:00.580 - 02:01:19.060, Speaker B: Hi, everyone. I'm excited to be with y'all at ETH Amsterdam tonight. We have some awesome prizes for integrating with Coinbase Wallet. I'm sure you've all heard of Coinbase. Hopefully some of you have heard of Coinbase Wallet too. It has our self custody wallet. It has millions of users.
02:01:19.060 - 02:01:40.268, Speaker B: We have a new feature called Coinbase Pay that's really interesting. It allows for fiat on ramp. If you link your Coinbase account, you should have prizes. Okay, perfect. These are our prizes for integrating with Coinbase Wallet. So it's $5,000. This is USD for first place, plus an introduction to our Ventures team.
02:01:40.268 - 02:01:57.570, Speaker B: So that's pretty exciting. $2,000 for second and 1500 for third place. My colleague JM gave a workshop earlier on what Coinbase Wallet is and how to integrate with it. So check that out on demand and then find us at our booth. Thanks, everyone.
02:01:58.420 - 02:02:04.260, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Next up, we have Natter from the Graph. Please welcome Natter on stage.
02:02:06.040 - 02:02:35.788, Speaker E: All right, I'm Natter Dabbot. I'm here with the Graph protocol. We're really excited to be here. We have a booth set up over there. If you're willing to come by and ask us some questions or pick up some swag, we'd love for you to do that. The Graph is an indexing and querying protocol for decentralized blockchain networks like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and a few dozen EVM compatible chains, as well as Near Protocol and IPFS. So with the Graph protocol, you can define the smart contract or smart contracts that you'd like to build an API with.
02:02:35.788 - 02:03:21.108, Speaker E: And we will allow you to deploy open APIs called subgraphs to our network, giving you a really nice querying API for doing things like full text search, relationships between your data, querying for filtering, sorting, all types of stuff. So if you want to learn more about the Graph, go to thegraph.com. We have documentation there to kind of get you up and running. We have $8,000 in prizes here. You can either build out a brand new subgraph and win either 1st, 2nd, or third prize, or I would say grand prize first and then second. Or you can actually use an existing subgraph that someone else has created that you can then find that's publicly available to use. So with that being said, I hope everyone has a great time working with the Graph, and if you have any questions again, come by.
02:03:21.108 - 02:03:29.550, Speaker E: We'll be at the booth all day tomorrow as well as part of Sunday. And we're giving a workshop later tonight, so check it out. Simone is giving that. Thank you.
02:03:30.160 - 02:03:33.760, Speaker C: Thanks, Natter. Next up, we have Jorge from Gnosis Safe.
02:03:34.340 - 02:04:14.552, Speaker H: Hey, everyone, Jorge here from Nosisafe. For those who aren't familiar, Nosisafe is a safety standard of Web Three and the most trusted platform for individuals and communities to manage their digital assets. So with Nosisafe programmable accounts, users essentially have much more control and granular permissions over controlling their assets. Currently, there are over $70 billion in USD stored on over 50,000 safes. So we'd love for you to join us in building out some future ideas that are relevant to what Vitalik was talking about around self sovereignty. So the first one being essentially a recovery module. So we're looking for novel ways for people to recover their assets.
02:04:14.552 - 02:04:43.510, Speaker H: In the worst case, so 4000 in bounties up for that one, and then novel ways to sign in with Nosisafe is our second bounty, another 4000 for that. And we're looking essentially for people to have just better compatibility with authenticating into applications using their safe. Last but not least, Herman is giving a workshop at 1230 in room eight on getting started with the Safe Core SDK. So come stop by our booth to learn more about Safe get started. If you have any questions, come talk to the team. Thanks.
02:04:43.880 - 02:04:48.980, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Next up, we have AP wine. Please welcome Gasper.
02:04:51.960 - 02:05:30.524, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. What if you could get your ave yield of an entire year, but today, that's one of the things that you can do with AP Wine. Through yield tokenization, we create derivatives and yield strategies in a very modular and composable way. And that's where you come into the picture. We want you to come up with good ideas and relevant integration to build on top of APY. And we actually have a workshop in a few minutes in room two where we'll showcase our SDK and demonstrate how easy it is to build with AP wine and leverage the manila composability of the space. So feel free to come to the booth.
02:05:30.524 - 02:05:37.410, Speaker D: Feel free to come to the workshop in a few minutes and we look forward to seeing very cool ideas and integration with APWINE. Thank you.
02:05:37.860 - 02:05:43.744, Speaker C: Thank you so much. Next up, we have kinex. Please welcome Sanche on stage.
02:05:43.872 - 02:06:19.810, Speaker D: Hello everyone. This is Sanche from Connects. Connects is a cross chain bridge which allows you to send any piece of information from one chain to another. And it could be anything token boat, NFT or whatnot. We are the only bridge in this space which is in the trust minimization and the most secure one without any trust assumption. So, yeah, if you care about the security, do build on us. And this is an event where we are launching and announcing our testnet, which will be live.
02:06:19.810 - 02:07:05.420, Speaker D: The testnet is live right now, but the product itself will be live in six weeks. And with this one, there are so many potential instant transfer from one chain to another. NFT bridge, dow to dow interaction, MetaWars to MetaWars, world, zaps, univ three twaps and whatnot. So everything is possible cross chain now. And this time we are offering three tire off prices, which we are offering where we are having the starting ones for contract to contract interactions on sending and receiving side. So do check those out. If you have any problem, we are happy to help you anytime.
02:07:05.420 - 02:07:15.250, Speaker D: And the price list and details are available on Discord as well as the dam site. So, yeah, peace out. Ciao. Thank you very much.
02:07:15.640 - 02:07:21.700, Speaker C: Thank you so much. And our last sponsor for today, please welcome Chandler from Uma.
02:07:24.520 - 02:08:17.396, Speaker D: Clearly they saved the best for last. I'm Chandler from Uma, and today we're just going to quickly run through a little bit about what Uma does. If you're a developer that needs to use an Oracle for any form of data that's not typically a price feed, we're the kinds of team that you're going to need to use for your hackathon. For our prizes, we're going to give $6,000 away for the first prize and second place runner up for the Honorable mention, $2,000. If you want to know how to go from zero to integrating with the optimistic Oracle, I have a workshop at 10:00 today. I highly recommend that for anyone that's wanting to get integrated with Optimistic Oracle and then superfluid mentioned yes, a little earlier, we have a product that we're going to co collaborate on. This is actually an Honorable Mention where we're throwing $10,000 joint between the two of us on this spec product.
02:08:17.396 - 02:08:24.250, Speaker D: You can find both of those on our Twitters. Either one of our Superfluid or at, uma, protocol. Looking forward to it.
02:08:28.380 - 02:08:53.628, Speaker C: All right, a couple more things to go before we close. There's a lot more prizes here, so 130 unique ones.

02:08:53.628 - 02:09:17.060, Speaker C: All right, to close, please pace yourself. We really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you. We really want you to all have fun. And this event is very much about experimentation and learning, so even if you don't finish what you wanted to do, we still encourage all of you to present and get some feedback on what you wanted to work on. And with that, let's get hacking. Thank you so much, everybody. We'll all see you here at the venue.
02:09:17.060 - 02:09:26.650, Speaker C: If you're still looking for a team, please come on this side. And we'll also convert this middle auditorium piece to a hacking spot, so let's get going. Thanks, everybody.
