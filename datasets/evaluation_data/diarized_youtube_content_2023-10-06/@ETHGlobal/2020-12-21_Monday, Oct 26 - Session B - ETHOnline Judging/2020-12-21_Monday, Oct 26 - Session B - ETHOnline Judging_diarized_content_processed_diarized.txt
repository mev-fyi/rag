00:00:00.330 - 00:00:27.240, Speaker A: You. So welcome, everybody, to ETH online judging day two. No, this is day three. What? I'm getting confused. Day three of judging. We've had an amazing month of hacking and learning. And if you hadn't seen the stats, we had over 700 hackers, 1000 applications, 65 countries, 19 time zones, huge event, and definitely with a global population of hackers, which is amazing to see.
00:00:27.240 - 00:01:18.022, Speaker A: Like I said, 175 projects. They've worked together for three weeks and ended up submitting some pretty wide ranging projects. Everything from DFI to personal tokens and everything in between. Today we're going to get the chance to actually see what people have built. So the format for today, as you are all probably aware, but just a quick reminder. Four minutes for video demo from each team, four minutes for questions from the judges or clarifications, and then we'll do a ten minute break halfway just to give you a chance to stretch your legs or get a glass of water, whatever you need to do. Another reminder for the criteria for what judges are actually looking into.
00:01:18.022 - 00:02:07.350, Speaker A: These would be technicality, originality, practicality, meaning how accessible it is for this project to actually be implemented, and then the UI, how people use it. And then the final thing is the wow factor, which is the wild card. We want to emphasize that it's not a competition. A lot of people, this might be their first event, so they're just dipping their toes into ethereum and web3, and they're here to learn. Not every project is necessarily becoming a business, so we would just want to keep that in mind. And we're very happy to have projects that are trying to pursue this after the event, but people that are here just to learn is totally fine as well. And the big thing is that hackers are here to get feedback from our wonderful judges.
00:02:07.350 - 00:02:39.360, Speaker A: Speaking of, we have three excellent community members with us today. Peter Pan from One KX, linda G from Scalar Capital, and Fernando Martinelli from Balancer. So welcome, judges. Hope you're ready for this session. And let's move on to the first demo. I think the first team is already promoted. That would be James, and I'll let you take it away.
00:02:39.810 - 00:02:41.600, Speaker B: All right, thanks.
00:02:54.290 - 00:03:54.630, Speaker C: Introducing Flavor, a spicy new twist on DeFi savings. The goal of Flavor is to provide the stability of dollar pegged, stablecoins savings from your tokens, earning a yield while they sit in your wallet, and a fun twist to make things a little more interesting. By combining stability, savings and a fun twist, flavor provides a simple, low risk way to bet on your favorite assets. It does this with a daily contest based on tracking changes in cryptocurrency prices. The winning asset each day is the one with the largest price percentage increase. Flavor uses pool together's no loss design, where only interest earned from deposited funds is used as prize rewards and not the deposited funds themselves. Flavor replaces pool together's randomly chosen raffle with a contest decided by chainlink price feed data for supported cryptocurrency assets.
00:03:54.630 - 00:04:56.090, Speaker C: Using flavor is simple. First, exchange USDC tokens for an equal amount of flavor tokens from the flavor finance website. First, unlock your wallet. Then select one of the supported cryptocurrency assets and a completed deposit of USDC in exchange for an equal number of flavor tokens. When you win a daily flavor contest, the balance of flavor tokens in your wallet automatically increase. The increase will be the interest earned by all flavor USDC deposits in the last day, split proportionally among you and the other participants who bet on the winning cryptocurrency. And finally, flavor tokens can always be exchanged back for an equal amount of USDC.
00:04:56.090 - 00:05:57.354, Speaker C: Withdrawing USDC is as easy as depositing. USDC flavor tokens are always fully collateralized, and this means that one flavor token should always be worth about one USDC. Some next steps for flavor include listing more crypto assets as well as non crypto assets to bet on. Anything with a price feed provided by an oracle can be supported. And this means it should be possible for bitcoin and DeFi tokens to compete against Tesla and Apple shares or any other type of asset. Other next steps include optimizing for decentralized exchanges like uniswap and balancer so that it's easy to trade any DeFi asset directly into flavor tokens instead of USDC without worrying about slippage. We'll make use of arbitrage bots to help maintain flavor's price peg and flavor token.
00:05:57.354 - 00:06:14.450, Speaker C: Liquidity mining will be used to farm flavor's governance token to encourage liquidity. This governance token will play a key role in converting flavor into a decentralized protocol owned and operated by its community. You can now check out flavor at flavor finance.
00:06:16.730 - 00:06:17.640, Speaker A: All right.
00:06:19.690 - 00:06:28.554, Speaker B: I realized that I think the MetaCartel which Peter is involved with, I think the chili pepper might be one of your icons. Didn't realize that.
00:06:28.592 - 00:06:31.690, Speaker A: Connection copyright infringement.
00:06:32.830 - 00:06:43.086, Speaker D: I'm just going off of the analogy of adding some spice. This is a really great platform to experiment with different other sources, if you will.
00:06:43.108 - 00:06:43.246, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:43.268 - 00:07:09.320, Speaker D: I mean, you could use the interest for allowing people to basically bet on, say, production markets, maybe no loss betting. This is one example where you could kind of save up a whole month's worth of interest rate and allow people to kind of allocate it based on that. And this is just one example, right. So I generally really like the idea, and I think this could be a really great platform for a lot of creativity to kind of merge from.
00:07:10.570 - 00:07:28.330, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. That's certainly the and I sort of think of it as sort of a mashup between pool together, like auger or Polymarket and something like origin OUSD, where it's a stable coin that increases balance in your wallet.
00:07:29.630 - 00:07:39.070, Speaker E: Yeah, I think this is really cool and something that I would actually play with. It sounds really fun. So are the payouts daily? Sorry if I missed that.
00:07:39.220 - 00:07:45.082, Speaker B: Yeah. Payouts are daily, although subject to change because of gas fees and so forth.
00:07:45.146 - 00:07:57.186, Speaker E: Yeah, I was going to say probably don't want daily payouts at this stage. And then also, I don't know if the amounts are going to be large enough for people to get super excited. So maybe some version of accruing it later or something.
00:07:57.368 - 00:08:20.140, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So I think we're going to want to look at the TVL and the number of crypto assets that we have. Right now, it's only three. It's basically bitcoin ether and DeFi, like a DeFi index. And so the number of assets that we have and also the rate of payout is going to probably be a factor of how much volume there is.
00:08:23.810 - 00:08:31.054, Speaker A: In what ways do you see yourselves using AMMS, like balancer and Uniswap and others for the system?
00:08:31.252 - 00:09:03.020, Speaker B: Yeah, so I sort of touched on that in the video, but I think the idea is that people can go to flavor finance and get flavor tokens there directly. But I think for a lot of people, once they know that these flavor tokens exist, they're selling some other token, they go to balancer and they say, I want to exchange whatever other token directly to flavor tokens. So flavor tokens just becomes like a wrapper for a stable coin. So it earns savings automatically and it kind of has that fun element to it.
00:09:03.790 - 00:09:18.800, Speaker A: Another question. You said that each flavor should be worth about one USDC because it's always collateralized. Why is it about at least or exactly or at least? Yeah.
00:09:23.030 - 00:09:29.460, Speaker B: It's difficult to maintain that exact peg on balancer, for example, but it should be very close to.
00:09:38.020 - 00:09:55.164, Speaker A: You. Thank you. All right, any final questions? Sounds like judges are satisfied. Thank you, James, for presenting, and I look forward to seeing what emoji you end up transitioning to.
00:09:55.362 - 00:09:59.420, Speaker B: Okay, well, I'll be in touch with Peter about the copyright case.
00:09:59.570 - 00:10:00.270, Speaker A: Sure.
00:10:00.640 - 00:10:01.052, Speaker B: Okay.
00:10:01.106 - 00:10:40.780, Speaker A: All right, so next up is Zenbit Protocol, and I'll let the next team take it away. We aren't able to hear, so maybe try it again without muting first and then you can mute after if you'd liked.
00:10:40.940 - 00:10:57.060, Speaker F: Sorry, I had my audio. Hi, this is the Sembit protocol we are presenting for the Eat Online 2020 hackathon. I'm Avacok Vera and I work on the front end and the main concept.
00:10:57.980 - 00:11:05.000, Speaker G: My name is Mario Rosenio. I work with solid contract, with smart contract and with the backend.
00:11:07.980 - 00:12:13.570, Speaker F: What we built, we built a protocol prototype that utilized digital skills as net rewards to boost financial inclusion in Mexican urban zones. So why we build it? Because in Mexico, 68% of Mexicans don't have a bank account. And plus 80% of people living in urban areas with Internet access are excluded from digital economy because a lack of digital skills. So these are the main barriers for people to enter digital economy. We tend to reduce this gap by teaching ethereum interactions with our MVP for Spanish spoken users, where users receive digital skills NFTs and fungible tokens as rewards and the gain, digital skills NFTs are required to access the following tasks. So, the live demo.
00:12:15.300 - 00:13:08.880, Speaker G: Once a user has been logged in in this application, he has to watch this video. Of course, there's a lot of work needed in the landing page in order to make it more user friendly, because now at the moment, we are only trying to demonstrate this MDP. Sorry. So once the user has watched every single video, he has to complete these tasks in order to him become familiarized with the functions he can do in a smart contract or event. So first, in order to complete this task and the user to win a certificate, a digital skill certificate, plus a monetary reward, he has to paste his public key, the one he authorized in the wallet, and click here in the button which says Get certificate.
00:13:10.100 - 00:14:29.240, Speaker F: After watching this demo, we will explain how it's made. This is an MVP for a proof of concept that we can digitize the digital skills of our users with three tasks. For developing these digital skills, we have used an RC 1155 contract to create the NFTs and the fungible tokens which are minted after the users are complete the task. So in the back end, it's a JavaScript with react app and MetaMask integrations. So you can find the live demo on our site, send it CT and well, our roadmap from now it's necessary to have a front end and user experience overhauling in order to have a more friendly interaction. Further, we want to add tasks for DeFi and Governor digital skills NFTs, as well as RC 20 for an SMB Topcat for liquidity and governance interactions and test with the real world interactions and assets in urban environments. Once we get to this point, probably it's time to go to mainnet and start to digital value on cities.
00:14:29.240 - 00:14:45.920, Speaker F: Thank you for your attention. You can find the documentation of the project in Dux, sendbit City or social media are at sendbit MX. So visit us and know more about this project. Thank you for your attention.
00:14:51.780 - 00:15:13.576, Speaker E: I like that you're focusing on Mexican urban zones. That's an area that I don't feel like a lot of people have been spending a lot of time building. So I'm really excited to see that. And then curious as to what do the NFTs actually look like. And then also you mentioned Znbt and what is that used for? So, trying to understand what people get from this.
00:15:13.758 - 00:16:24.300, Speaker F: So, we want to take advantage of the 1155 contract capabilities to make a batch of a non fungible token and a fungible token. So the certificate is a non fungible token that gives the user digital skill that they can use a product or an interaction. Like in this example, it's like use the public keys. So the other part in Mexico is the lack of access to bank accounts make an interesting thing to give a fungible reward in order to start to interact with digital assets and get more familiarized with the environment and how interactions are with MetaMask and all the things users need to know first to interact with more complex protocols.
00:16:25.760 - 00:16:26.888, Speaker A: Cool, thanks.
00:16:27.074 - 00:16:45.750, Speaker D: Have you thought much about how you would onboard users into like I guess in terms of key management because you mentioned MetaMask just then. But have you thought about integrating things such as like burner wallets that allow you to kind of hold these NFTs temporarily before someone sets up the full account?
00:16:46.700 - 00:17:51.420, Speaker F: Well, it's supposed to be permanently some basic interactions. I think the first time is the most difficult time to interact with these things but other that require digital skills that get updated like coding or other implementations. Probably the NFD will require to get an expiration date or a validation date until the user get updated on that part and then again start to use the service in order to avoid mistakes and I don't know, loss of capital that the users actually don't want and the ignorance to know how it works. Probably the main case for most users.
00:17:51.920 - 00:17:53.950, Speaker D: Great idea though. Love it.
00:17:59.600 - 00:18:09.490, Speaker A: Quick question, what ways do you see those NFTs being valuable and useful like ideas for the future?
00:18:10.980 - 00:19:27.370, Speaker F: Well, I think in Mexico the lack of knowledge on digital skills could give a reference to users how they can evolve to interact like, I don't know, compounding interest products like balancer or other more complex user interactions. But my experience with people is they lack a lot of digital skills. The first barrier. It's difficult to people understand what they are doing. And I think this part could be a great moment to implement because, well, my country is on the verge, like the cases in Argentina or Venezuela and I think like preventing these scenarios and have education that can actually get user access to other services or more complex services I think could be a good point to start.
00:19:28.220 - 00:20:05.110, Speaker A: Thank you. I think that's a great summary right where we can end it. Thank you for presenting. Bye bye bye. Next up is Llama Community. It may not have shared your sound. Do you want to try that again? Check.
00:20:20.400 - 00:21:41.190, Speaker H: I built Llama Community which is a tool to manage your crypto community treasury. I help manage the treasury for a crypto community that I'm involved with and I found the Treasury Management and budget tracking process pretty cumbersome. The first step it involves is the community proposing things and voting on those proposals on snapshot. When a proposal gets passed then the treasurer and the signers of the multi SIG wallet then execute on those proposals and finally the treasurer updates the budget based on what is spent from the wallet, typically on a spreadsheet. I'm trying to make this workflow easier, making it easy for a treasurer or someone else from the community to set a budget for the Community Treasury to track inflows and outflows and to maintain the community's runway. What I've built is a version one. I have a lot more to do and I would look at what I've built as a very initial version of what I plan to do.
00:21:41.190 - 00:23:36.580, Speaker H: Now, if I go to llama Community, I'm first going to enter some inflows that this Community Treasury is going to get. So now we have this community getting 13,000 tokens of income in October 2020. I'll now enter some expenses. It we have 8000 tokens worth of expenses, which is 62% of the income coming in in October. And so we're left with 5000 tokens at the end of October. Now I'll talk about what I plan to do, which is, in the near term, make sure the user can enter their Ethereum address and automatically track inflows and outflows, as well as tag certain expenses based on what they want to be represented in the budget, and then also assess their projected runway for the community treasury over a longer period of time. I would like to add an option for users to make payments via sabler and also earn yield from the token balance in the treasury.
00:23:43.730 - 00:24:27.420, Speaker D: First, I love this project because I would use it for half the Dowels I'm part of. I think there's a few tweaks I'd definitely request as a potential user, right? Like maybe managing the treasury in ETH. Obviously, I guess tracking proposals and I guess even stuff such as when we make proposals, right. It's often requested in USD terms, even though the actual amount is in ETH. And just like yeah, I think there's like a lot this is a big problem space for Dows. So I recommend just further talking to more Dows, talk to more coordinators. I think it's a big problem.
00:24:29.150 - 00:24:38.240, Speaker H: Great, thank you. By the way, I can't share my video. I think the host has disabled that. But yeah, thanks for the feedback. I agree with that.
00:24:39.490 - 00:25:17.770, Speaker E: Yeah, I also really love it. Dows are obviously going to be huge and just more frequent and people are going to be having to manage their treasuries. So this is a very useful tool for them. I completely agree. Having it in ETH obviously would be really helpful, but I know that that is a future integration. And then when you start having the enablement of payments, it could be interesting to have some sort of system where people can permission check that this is like a good payment or something. I know there's in these kind of traditional world systems there's a lot of auditing and permission process, so that could be interesting in the future.
00:25:17.770 - 00:25:20.570, Speaker E: So it's not just like one person controlling all the funds.
00:25:20.990 - 00:25:42.894, Speaker D: Side note, sorry, one idea came about which is like, most Dows always have kind of like a hot wallet, a sidewall, it multi SIG, if you will, where Dows access funds for quicker cook use right. And this could be I could definitely see a part of where you deploy a Gnosis multi SIG as we're showing the same interface.
00:25:42.942 - 00:25:43.154, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:43.192 - 00:25:49.320, Speaker D: And you can kind of see Hot Wallet usage as well and who's managing that too. So idea.
00:25:54.090 - 00:26:05.270, Speaker A: Do you see that as a standalone product or more of an app that could be used inside Aragon or Nose is safe and why? Curious.
00:26:07.530 - 00:26:34.140, Speaker H: I'm not sure yet. My initial thought is is a standalone app that I guess communities can sort of just input their budget into this and sort of this be the place that they track what's going on. But I do think there are limitations of doing that because it's harder to enable payments and other things.
