00:00:00.170 - 00:00:00.430, Speaker A: Wow.
00:00:00.500 - 00:00:07.406, Speaker B: A lot of familiar faces here. Let's want to say hi to all of you and let's get this started.
00:00:07.588 - 00:00:37.234, Speaker C: Awesome. All right, thanks everyone. Great conversation. So we thought about as. We're looking at I know the rest of the team may have not seen the image I put this morning in front of the team here, but I look at the universe, right, as, as a falcon universe, as a nursery of stars. Essentially. We're building the new, the next gen MSPs, but also new applications.
00:00:37.234 - 00:01:19.874, Speaker C: New projects are being born every single day. And Hackaths is one of the big nurseries, I would say, where we're building these new projects. So this conversation today, what we wanted to do is talk a little bit more about what it would take to move your project forward and either raise funds or participate in one of our accelerating our amazing accelerated programs. So we have four representatives of one from Techstars, one from Tachyon, LongHash and Outlier Ventures. All four are either running accelerated programs or are starting to run a new accelerated program. So with me we've got Gabriel. Gabriel, let's kick off the conversation.
00:01:19.874 - 00:01:40.778, Speaker C: You're a very experienced web3 accelerator. Obviously you're currently running a program now, compared to a year ago. What trends have you seen, particularly in raising capital in the web3 space, and what recommendations would you give to the new entrepreneurs in raising capital today?
00:01:40.944 - 00:01:58.030, Speaker D: Yeah, great question. So first, super excited to be here. I love coming to hack FS. I love coming to these events. It's always amazing to see all the incredible builders. I'm Gabriel, the managing director of Tachyon. For those of you that don't know, Tachyon is a part of Consensus Mesh.
00:01:58.030 - 00:03:55.030, Speaker D: We've collectively incubated and invested in north of 100 projects and companies within the ecosystem. Some that are some of the key pillars of the ethereum ecosystem, companies like Infura and MetaMask and Three, Box and Pegasus and Truffle, so on and so forth. Tachyon is our accelerator, which is where the most ambitious early stage web3 founders come to join us for a twelve week sprint to really hone their value proposition, test their assumptions with real customers, and prepare for the next stage of investment and growth. And so I think at this stage I have mentored advised north of 65 70 web3 founders and companies, many of which have gone on to successfully raise and or exit. And every time founders come through a cohort, I think the thing that hasn't changed is the good old fashioned principles of how you go about building a company, how you go about building a startup, right? Companies are built to solve problems, and most startups never actually find a real or valuable problem to solve. So it doesn't matter if you're a web two startup or a web3 startup. The fundamentals are the same, right? The fundamentals are, have you honed in on a really good problem? What is that problem? Who has that problem? What's the intensity of that problem? How often do they have that problem? Are you operating in a good market? Are you operating in a market that is large and or growing and moving fast? Have you figured out what your startup does in terms of being a differentiated solution in the market? Do you have an insight into the user or the customers that you have and the problems that they have? Investors are not investing in your vision quest, right? Investors are investing in companies, in teams that have the ability to hone in on really good, valuable problems and solve those problems for real users.
00:03:55.030 - 00:05:13.274, Speaker D: Outside of that, I think the other solid fundamentals would be show, don't tell. Can you actually prove demand? Do you have the ability to build a real product? Are your early users or customers really interested in this? Can you prove traction? Can you prove demand? These are the fundamentals of building any startup, any company. I've been a three time founder, two time entrepreneur, where I went in house to build companies. Those things never change. In terms of the trends and maybe some of the nuances of building a web3 startup, I think two of the most unfair competitive modes in terms of web3 startups are community and composability. And a lot of the trends that we're seeing right now for web3 companies that can really think about where they fit into the stack and then can actually build a strong community around their product, those are the ones that we always see that break out. And in terms of some of the trends that we're starting to see, obviously we're like in NFT summer, but we're really interested and we're starting to see more and more investors approach us about this idea of composability and convergence.
00:05:13.274 - 00:05:44.380, Speaker D: So as we start to see NFTs converge with DeFi or NFTs converge with Dows and Dow Tooling or NFTs can converge with social gaming metaverse type of plays, I think those are really kind of like the interesting plays in terms of what we're starting to see and investor activity. But the fundamentals are the fundamentals of how you go about building a company. And I think my other esteemed panelists here, I think, would 100% agree with me in terms of what they see in terms of successful companies.
00:05:44.830 - 00:06:05.114, Speaker C: That's awesome. Yeah, I know some great ideas there. NFTs. You mentioned NFT. I just want to jump in on that. It's definitely a hot season. But my take is that eventually all data that we store create right, will eventually store it as sort of like in an NFT type of format.
00:06:05.114 - 00:06:09.380, Speaker C: Do you agree with that or do you see that the web two world is starting to see that?
00:06:10.950 - 00:06:47.086, Speaker D: I think we're always starting to see some of those primitives and I'll tell you, like Gen one of NFTs. So I was building my startups back when social media platforms were the big thing. I've seen this meta trend already play out. I know how this plays out. Back when companies first started getting onto some of the social platforms, they tried to take their shitty print publication and slap it on the Facebook page and call it a day. They weren't actually hacking around the nuances of the actual platform. And I think we're seeing the same thing with NFTs, right? Don't get me wrong, I'm all about Aping into the board apes and the crypto punks, and I think it's fun and it's great.
00:06:47.086 - 00:07:21.030, Speaker D: But I'm really interested to see gen Two, gen Three versions of NFTs and how you start to hack around. Composability and use NFTs and their composability to continue the consumer journey and experience. And I think that's why we're starting to see NFTs converge with other trends like DeFi, like Data, Dows and Dow Tooling. So, yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. And you're going to start to see new and interesting use cases of NFTs as they map to extending the consumer.
00:07:21.690 - 00:07:42.766, Speaker C: Awesome. Awesome. Love it. Moving on to Isaac. Isaac, Techstars is recently new to the Falcon ecosystem. You guys are starting a new acceleration program. What is Techstars looking for when recruiting web? Three founders? Yeah.
00:07:42.868 - 00:08:13.050, Speaker A: Well, Stefan, thanks for inviting me to join this awesome panel. So, I'm Isaac Kato. I'm the managing director of the new Filecoin Techstars accelerator. I'm a serial entrepreneur and a longtime early stage tech investor. So I've started two companies, I've run three. I've raised a couple hundred million dollars in equity and debt capital, and I've had a couple of good exits. I was also a VC for about a decade, most recently with General Catalyst Partners, and I'm a longtime angel investor.
00:08:13.050 - 00:08:57.678, Speaker A: So I'm super excited to be spinning up the New Filecoin Techstars accelerator. It's quite a mouthful, but it'll run next year from March 21 through mid June. And if you don't know, techstars is the global network that helps entrepreneurs succeed. We have roughly 50 accelerators in the global network. Collectively, our founders have raised over $15 billion of capital. There are, I think, now 15 unicorns, and we have a collective market cap of about $52 billion. Really notably on the point of trying to help founders find success, of the 2700 companies that have gone through techstars accelerator, 86% of them are still in business or have exited.
00:08:57.678 - 00:09:33.230, Speaker A: And our blockchain and crypto alums include folks like Chain Analysis and Trading View and Rweave. And my own crypto journey starts in 2013, when I brought the first bitcoin miners to Iceland. So I built the first large scale data center in Iceland, and I stumbled across bitcoin miners who were sort of a perfect customer for us to bring to Iceland, and they ultimately composed about 50% of our business. I think in late 2014, we estimated that 5% of global mining capacity for bitcoin was actually in our facility.
00:09:33.390 - 00:09:33.906, Speaker C: Wow.
00:09:34.008 - 00:10:15.570, Speaker A: So that was a fun and wild ride. So to get your question, what do we look for in terms of founders? First and foremost, the first lens we ever look at a company at our prospective applicant is the founder. We care first and foremost about founder quality and their DNA. So regardless of whether you're doing Web Three or something more traditional, we certainly want to see people with a big vision and a desire to make a very big positive impact on the world. We want to see brilliance and capability. Execution really matters. One thing that I look for specifically is founder Market Fit.
00:10:15.570 - 00:11:04.450, Speaker A: So I want teams or solo founders who have really deep insight into the problem that they're trying to solve. They're not just sort of tourists trying something cool out, but they've thought about this problem for a while. Maybe they've experienced it themselves and maybe they have an earned secret. Maybe they've figured something out that nobody else has figured out, and particularly how to apply Web Three infrastructures and methodologies to the problem they're trying to solve. I look for people who have evidence that they're rapid learners and iterators, I think, the sole competitive advantage that most companies have at these very early stages is just how quickly you can move. And you've got to be humble enough to learn and get feedback quickly and make quick changes and implement them. So that matters.
00:11:04.450 - 00:12:01.330, Speaker A: And then specifically for Web Three founders, I'm going to completely echo one of the themes that Gabriel mentioned, which is that we want people who understand not just the tech stacks and the Web Three and token infrastructures and mechanics that they're using, but how they apply to real world problems that they're trying to solve. Because at the end of the day, while I firmly believe that decentralized infrastructures should provide meaningfully, better solutions to a lot of the problems out there, we're still ultimately trying to solve a customer's pain point or fulfill their desires. If it's a consumer application and it's just not enough to build cool shit, you got to build cool shit that other people care about. So I'll say the exact same thing. We want people who understand how to take the Web Three world and make a fundamental difference to solving a problem or fulfilling a desire.
00:12:02.310 - 00:12:37.120, Speaker C: Cool. You got to create cool shit that our people care about. That's a tagline I'm going to start using. Awesome. Maybe let's move to outlier Ventures. Blake, outlier Ventures just closed their application round. This will be your first cohort, and then you've been investing in open data economy for the last seven years, right? What type of projects are you looking for and where do you experience the most value and where do you think new startups should be focusing on?
00:12:38.290 - 00:13:06.018, Speaker E: Great question, Stefan. And allow me to start by thanking for the opportunity to be here. I'm always honored and humbled to be in front of Hackafes, and I truly believe there will be a lot of great projects coming out of it. I'm Blake Lazenski. I'm the program manager of the FalcoIn base camp at Outlier Ventures. Quickly about our organization, we started in 2013 and one of the probably first European web free focused investors. Probably still one of the biggest globally in terms of number of deals.
00:13:06.018 - 00:13:47.160, Speaker E: Then around 20, 16, 17 we started investing on a venture scale in seed and precede deals. But around 2019 we understood that with the expertise and people we have on board, the optimal value we can deliver to founders and teams is actually through an acceleration program. And that's how Basecamp came to life. And as you mentioned, Stefan, this is the first time we're teaming up with an external organization. And I'm super glad It's Protocol Labs to deliver a version of Basecamp that is dedicated to a specific technology stack. So in terms of projects we're looking for, I'm very keen to see projects that have a token in their future and are crypto heavy. I believe this is where we as Outlier Ventures can add maximum value.
00:13:47.160 - 00:14:59.450, Speaker E: We accept solo founders and teams. My perfect sort of mindset to come to the program with would be to be great on the technicalities but also appreciate the value of go to market. I would also like to see projects that see the value of Protocol Lab stack beyond just simple storage capacity and many other implications that come out from the technology. We would like to dedicate the program mostly to the middleware layer and the infrastructure. We think this is the key to the persistence of the metaverse and making it truly open as well as introduce an optimal user experience to NFTs. As you mentioned, we have a lot of experience investing in the new data economy, maybe to some extent longer than anybody else. And we have a full supply chain from Data to Compute in our Portfolio ocean Protocol that allows users to create a decentralized marketplace for Data secret network, which is the first blockchain with data privacy by default fetch AI, an open access tokenized decentralized machine learning network, as well as Kudos decentralized compute network and enabling blockchain scalability.
00:14:59.450 - 00:15:42.950, Speaker E: So where can we add the most value? We are extremely commercially minded, hence my point about amazing technical minds coming to us. We always put emphasis on fundraising and tokenomics. In the last twelve months of Basecamp, we helped raise 130,000,000 of seed capital for our projects. Since 2019, the combined value of the Base Camp portfolio is $1 billion. At the peak of the bull run it was closer to $3 billion. And we have several billion dollar networks, including Bozem Protocol and Dia Data. We also work with a network of 1500 co investors, from world leading investors in west and east, from tier one VCs all the way down to community pools.
00:15:42.950 - 00:16:18.440, Speaker E: So we truly can help you find capital anywhere. So we look for technical teams that want to create a scalable business and attract capital. That understand. There is a gap between creating a great MVP to hit the market and actually bringing it to that market and commercializing it successfully. And this is where we can help also including hiring of commercial people and custom go to market strategies. We rely on our huge network of partners, including large enterprise organizations. And finally, we have a very complementary alumni stack around data Economy, data Marketplaces, compute, and.
00:16:22.330 - 00:16:28.586, Speaker C: That'S great. By the way, you're calling in from UK or somewhere in Europe, right?
00:16:28.768 - 00:16:31.900, Speaker E: I'm currently calling in from Ibiza. Just.
00:16:34.110 - 00:16:36.858, Speaker C: I want to be at right now. Yeah, that would be cool.
00:16:36.944 - 00:16:37.820, Speaker D: Poor guy.
00:16:38.190 - 00:17:00.740, Speaker C: Yeah, poor guy. Because one thing I wanted to call out is that we have four great partners here on the table, but all of them are calling in from different areas. Right. We have representation in Europe, Asia, and the US. And that brings me to the next partner. Stefano, maybe you can tell us, where are you based today?
00:17:01.510 - 00:17:04.846, Speaker F: I'm also based in an island, but I'm in Singapore. I'm in Singapore.
00:17:04.878 - 00:17:05.618, Speaker C: Oh, there you go.
00:17:05.704 - 00:17:07.480, Speaker F: Pretty much on the other side of the world.
00:17:07.930 - 00:17:22.970, Speaker C: Yeah. So welcome. So you're from LongHash Ventures. You closed your recent application window as well. Very familiar with the web. Three world. How are investors differentiating themselves, particularly in a bull market condition?
00:17:23.550 - 00:17:56.834, Speaker F: Yeah, well, first of all, also super excited to be here today. Thanks a lot for having me. Very glad to be able to speak to everyone. So I'm Stefan Aburi, I'm the program lead at Long Hatch Ventures, and I'll just give a quick intro to our organization. So we're a Web Three investment fund, and we're also Asia's leading Web Three accelerator program. For those of you who haven't heard of us before, don't know us. So we've accelerated over 40 projects over the last about three, three and a half years, and we've helped them raise over $100 million in funding.
00:17:56.834 - 00:19:04.166, Speaker F: And earlier this year we launched a $20 million D Five focused and to an extent NFT focused now fund, where we've invested in over 30 companies, including the likes of Instadap, Sapper, mintable, and Alchemy NFT. And yeah, as you mentioned, we just closed applications, I think a couple of weeks ago for our next cohort, which will have a file contract. So it's the second time that we partner with Protocol Labs to run the filecoin frontier accelerator. Super excited. So some great applications, and we're in the process of reviewing them in the next few weeks. I think then to your question around how investors are differentiating themselves, and especially in the past twelve or 16 months where we've been in a pretty strong bull market, I think that first of all, of course, you see a lot of capital available for projects. And I think as investors, you even see some notable investors that are really almost like fighting to actually be able to get into funding rounds.
00:19:04.166 - 00:20:05.742, Speaker F: And so I think if you go back a few more years or even a decade or more where capital and the network was all you needed as an investor to bring to the table, that's definitely not the case and it definitely hasn't been the case over the past year. I think that investors really need to put forward their value proposition beyond money and network to their portfolio companies. Whether you're meeting investors through an accelerator program or through other channels, I think that investors have to get their hands dirty. They really need to help the startups with developing the product, the strategy, scaling growth, and even to continue to innovate, right. Particularly in Web Three where you see protocols, they launch a V one, then there's a V two and so on and so forth. And I think investors need to be part of that development in one way or another. And I think investors really have to become venture builders, right? I mean, capital is not enough.
00:20:05.742 - 00:20:42.380, Speaker F: And as a matter of fact, we started out as an accelerator and then we launched a fund, but we decided to keep the accelerator because for us, it's a way, a structured way for us to be able to help projects. And I think particularly when it comes to Web Three, you need investors that are also knowledgeable about the space. Right, so it's not just the Web Two topics like the go to market, the business model, et cetera, but it's really around designing the Tokenomics, helping the projects decide which decentralized governance model they go for, things like that.
00:20:43.630 - 00:21:03.810, Speaker C: I think you bring up some good points, Stefana, is like the token sale is definitely or the Tokenomics in general is definitely new to a lot of traditional investors too. So maybe a question for Gabriel would love to get your perspective on what sort of the recommendations do you give to startups when it comes to Token sales and raising capital around that, right?
00:21:03.880 - 00:22:07.494, Speaker D: Yeah, 100%. I think the introduction of Tokens is unique to Web Three and so in terms of building your startup, it's definitely an unfair competitive advantage compared to those of us who built our companies in the Web Two era. But I see a lot of founders and a lot of teams rush to launch a Token before they've actually built utility and or a community around that token. And I think that's a big miss. Shout out to Jesse Walden from Variant, formerly of a 16 Z the goat. He wrote a piece a long time ago called Progressive Decentralization, which has always been kind of like the framework, our mental model for how we think about companies and how we think about startups and how they should think. About launching a token, which is you've got to find utility and function first, and you should really spend a lot of time focused on your community, especially the early, early stages of the community.
00:22:07.494 - 00:23:12.358, Speaker D: Launching a token is just like launching a product or just like launching a company. It is that hard. And trying to do both before you've actually found utility or function or product market fit with your startup is a big miss. And what I see is I see a lot of investors who push startups to try to launch a token that has more to do about optionality and liquidity for the investor than it actually does. Does it make sense for that particular project and that particular startup? So for startups who actually find utility and function, find product market fit, who find early use cases and then can rally their community, it's a massive unfair competitive advantage as they go into market. Essentially, your community are both your users and your investors in some cases. In that case, which I think for a lot of startups is the holy grail, but I always have founders step back and make sure that their token has real utility, has real use, has a real function, and it's not just about trying to create liquidity.
00:23:12.358 - 00:23:18.070, Speaker D: And I think it's really important for founders to focus on that first and foremost.
00:23:18.230 - 00:23:54.838, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, I know. I couldn't agree more with you. It's definitely a topic that's coming up a lot more often now as startups are investing and sort of raising capital. Definitely in a bull market. Some of the startups question like, hey, why should I join an accelerated program? So maybe Isaac would love to get your perspective on why should they join accelerated program? And when they choose a program, of course, we have four programs here at the table and we're going to create more. What should they be looking at right when they select one of the accelerators? What's your take on that?
00:23:54.924 - 00:24:57.770, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you have four terrific options right here. And when I'm talking to founders about, hey, why should I come into your accelerator, let alone any accelerator? What I always say is, look, our value proposition boils down to we will dramatically increase your chances of success in your entrepreneurial pursuits. It's as simple as that. If you don't think that we're going to ten x the probability of your succeeding, you shouldn't come because you're going to give up a decent chunk of equity for in most cases, not a ton of money. But what you're getting is an incredible basket of goodies that will really help you to find success. Certainly the techstars numbers, and it sounds like my colleagues numbers, really play that out if you go to a high quality accelerator. So to disaggregate that a bit, what should you be looking for? For sure you want to find a place that will dramatically expand your network.
00:24:57.770 - 00:25:44.678, Speaker A: It's in our tagline. We are the global network that helps entrepreneurs succeed and I think everybody else here would agree with that. But you should be sure that by coming into an accelerator you're going to just explode your network by orders of magnitude and then oftentimes that's the most valuable thing that you'll get, whether it's access to investors or customers or prospective hires, ecosystem partners, mentors. What we often do is get people who maybe have been toying wheeling away and quiet, but are not necessarily national networkers. All of a sudden they have access to people they never could have dreamed of. And so I think network is a big part of what you should be evaluating. Certainly closely tied to that is access to capital.
00:25:44.678 - 00:26:24.486, Speaker A: If you're going to come into an accelerator, we should really be able to help you to raise money. And I think everyone here is quite good at that. But you want to make sure that, look at our track records and see have you been able to help the companies that have gone through the accelerator raise money? Certainly again, the case of Techstars, we have a global network of 15,000 early stage investors as well as the very strong personal networks that each MD like I have. And again, we have a great track record. But make sure you're going to actually get people who will help you raise capital. It's still on you. You're the founder, you have to bring your A game to do it.
00:26:24.486 - 00:27:07.250, Speaker A: But we can help a lot on that front. Mentorship and expertise, I think that's just super critical. Mentorship is part of the core experience at Techstars. In fact, it matters so much that we take two of the first weeks in program doing mentor speed dating to help you find three to five lead mentors who are dedicated to spending time with you while you're in program. But also that kind of leads to the next point. Make sure that you're going to get long term support from an accelerator. We do not say, okay, you've been through your 13 weeks and then kick you out the door and say goodbye, we're here for the long haul, we're investors in your company, we have a ton of incentive to see you succeed.
00:27:07.250 - 00:27:55.730, Speaker A: And again, we put a lot of effort not just at the MD level, but at the Techstars global network level to ensure that there is long term support for our Alums in the form of portfolio services. So that when you get onto the next thing, you're trying to build your team, you're trying to find the right, you're moving into a new sector, whatever. You can usually find it throughout Techstars, not just while you're in program, but for hopefully years after. And then I think the last thing is everything always still kind of boils down to people. So spend time with the MDS and the program teams at the programs you're evaluating. Make sure you like them. I know I can't speak for the others, but I know at Techstars most founders tell me, look, I experience Techstars through the lens of the managing director.
00:27:55.730 - 00:28:14.700, Speaker A: Make sure that you like the MD because you're going to be spending a lot of time with them, make sure they're accessible, make sure they actually have some value to impart and some wisdom to impart. I think those are the high level things that I would evaluate. There are plenty of others, but those are maybe the most important in my mind.
00:28:15.070 - 00:28:46.434, Speaker C: Yeah, people do business with people, right? Yeah. Whatever you sell, you're selling to human. Thanks, Isaac. So a week ago, I was actually talking to one of my friends who pitched an idea of startup. He's doing his own startup and was pitching to a VC and the response he got was like, love the idea. Can you add crypto to that? I thought it was funny because then I can. Again, it was sort of an indicator that there's a lot more momentum there too.
00:28:46.434 - 00:28:58.230, Speaker C: And this is a traditional VC firm. Not going to bring up their name, but anyway. Stefano at LongHash Ventures, what are some of the use cases that you're seeing that are gaining the most traction with investors?
00:28:58.810 - 00:29:45.720, Speaker F: I was going to say, before I answer that question, you reminded me, I think this was in 2017, there was an iced tea company in New York, if I'm not mistaken, that put Blockchain or Crypto in their name and their stock went up like I don't know how much. But anyway, hopefully not a top signal. Look, I think in terms of winning cases, I think Gabriel said it earlier, if last year we had DeFi summer, this year we definitely have NFT summer. And I think we're right in the midst of it. I think obviously there's some hype, there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of things to waddle through. We as an investor do come across a lot of NFT platforms. And I think I mentioned we have invested in some of the earlier ones.
00:29:45.720 - 00:30:14.480, Speaker F: But I think also to link it to Gabriel's point is really around utility. And some of the winning NFT models going forward are around utility. We've seen it with gaming, of course. Axie Infinity is the most, I would say famous or well known example, but there's plenty of others. We are seeing it with some of these social dows and launching NFDS that have some utility linked to it.
00:30:18.310 - 00:30:18.674, Speaker E: Even.
00:30:18.712 - 00:31:07.134, Speaker F: We're seeing it in the Metaverse in the form of real estate. Right? So metaversal real estate, if you will. I was hearing, I think yesterday, some fairly well known media houses from Asia buying land in the Metaverse and then looking at launching NFTs that have utility around having events. I mean, we're basically now all used to being on Zoom for these kind of events. And while I guess a lot of us are probably itching to meet up in person, but there will still be a form of this virtual in the future. And how can we actually make it a better experience by leveraging this kind of technology? So I think that's. One emerging, let's call it a use case of NFTs, that I think are starting to gain some traction among investors.
00:31:07.134 - 00:32:03.460, Speaker F: And I think the other one is DFI is still really big and I think we believe that we're just getting started. I think in the past twelve or 16 months we saw DFI explode. Right? And I think what we're starting to see now is that we're going beyond the simple, for lack of a better word, applications of TradFi coming into DFI and starting to see the more sophisticated products coming in. So things like derivatives, structured products, all these more sophisticated financial instruments starting to crop up the DeFi version of it. Which is very exciting because I think for one is that we see more momentum in this space. But then second, I also believe that this is one of the ways that we can at some point in the future start to link with the traditional financial system.
00:32:05.270 - 00:32:57.602, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's great to see all these new products. I see it on the lending side as well. It's sort of like an iteration, right? You have the first program, high interest rates, high collateral requirements and slowly on they start to implement what currently exists in the traditional financing world and starting to improve on it. So it's amazing to see all the innovation. You did mention something that I want to pick up on is that the metaverse? I want Blake's view on that because Outline Ventures has been very vocal about and very engaged on bringing the metaverse in different verticals. So what's your take on that Blake? Where do you see web3 storage startups and trends in this whole new metaverse evolve? Do we have Blake? Yeah.
00:32:57.656 - 00:33:38.382, Speaker E: So thank you for bringing up the metaverse operating system. Probably organizationally one of our favorite things to talk about. And allow me to start by saying that at Outlier Ventures we consider ourselves an evergreen investor. So looking into the future we invest and support startups throughout the bull market and bear market. Actually some of our best investments were made in the deep dark freeze of the crypto winter. So in the context of the metaverse operating system and trends, we try to look beyond the web itself up until the point when digital becomes undistinguished from real. In context of social media you can also see it happening with gaming virtual worlds.
00:33:38.382 - 00:34:45.910, Speaker E: So from the perspective of trends that means the world will become more automated and it's important how data is permissioned and controlled. It has to be user centric. The difference would be the user is in control of the data and they can give permissions and commoditize that asset. They can participate in the value that is generated from data in combination with things like Falcon and IPFS access to other protocols that when combined enhance privacy preserving computation, commodification of data in data marketplaces and institutional buyouts. You need data for AI and machine learning and we have those complete projects in our portfolio and can accelerate startups working with decentralized cloud in its totality. Other aspects of the Metaverse operating system thesis that this is touching I believe is financialization of data, the user centricity based on the principles of sovereignty, which is very close to my heart personally. And I truly believe currently you need expensive hardware to access the Metaverse.
00:34:45.910 - 00:35:14.670, Speaker E: So those kind of technologies can increase performance and can offset some of the cost by renting out the capacity and in turning cryptocurrencies and joining the virtual world economy. So I think you need data for AI and machine learning, as I mentioned. And I truly believe Falcon and APFS is the key to solve that and make the Metaverse truly open, persistent, and interoperable.
00:35:15.330 - 00:35:34.294, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah. Thank players. Any axio infinity players on this panel? Because I just installed it like two weeks ago. I'm still trying to get my right team together. No. Any recommendations on what combination I should go for? No.
00:35:34.294 - 00:35:45.562, Speaker C: Anyway, put it in the chat. All right, well, we have one question from the audience. Kartik, can you maybe take that question and we'll wrap it up?
00:35:45.696 - 00:36:10.340, Speaker B: It was a really awesome discussion. I think this question, I'll rephrase the question, but it's been answered in parts. But maybe we'll kind of ask this more concretely, but do you have any frameworks around how should you think about forming a legal entity or launching your company if you have a Token? And obviously this question is going to differ based on where you are. But for all of you here, any comments, advice, or frameworks that you like to talk about would be great.
00:36:13.510 - 00:36:15.640, Speaker D: Who wants to wade into this one?
00:36:16.490 - 00:36:18.360, Speaker C: It's very hard question.
00:36:18.810 - 00:37:00.850, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll take a shot at it, but I'm sure Stefano, I know you guys have worked with a bunch of DeFi projects, blake as well, I'm sure. Isaac, you guys are working with them as well, I guess. First and foremost, I'm not an attorney. I don't play one on TV or hackathons, et cetera. So this is not legal advice for anybody. But yeah, we've worked with a number of projects who have launched Tokens, Pydal, ILO Finance, Secured Finance, Power, Loom, so many great companies. I would say, and I know our legal counsel above this, first and foremost, get really good, competent counsel.
00:37:00.850 - 00:37:42.750, Speaker D: Do not skirt this. Do not skirt this. You want to find counsel who is extremely competent in both web3 and has done this before. So don't get your brother in law because he practices law on the side. Don't do that whole thing in terms of jurisdictions that you're looking for, it really depends on the nature of your project and the nature of your Token. What we have seen historically is a number of different structures and setups. We've seen a Delaware C Corp parent and then a child that sits in BVI or Cayman Islands, something like that, something with friendly jurisdictions.
00:37:42.750 - 00:38:14.250, Speaker D: Again, this is not legal advice. Here's what I would tell you. If you have even a single customer, even a user who's using a VPN who's based in the States, you're not going to skirt the SEC. So don't even think about it. We've seen a number of jurisdictions that are friendly to DeFi that are friendly to tokens. I named a couple Singapore shout out. Singapore has great jurisdictions for token and token based projects.
00:38:14.250 - 00:38:32.190, Speaker D: But I cannot stress this. Please, please go get really good competent counsel. If you are thinking about launching a token, it will more than pay for itself in spades in saving you a whole bunch of headaches and potentially ending up in an orange jumpsuit.
00:38:34.610 - 00:39:32.290, Speaker F: Yeah, I will just add to that and I will also give the disclaimer that I am also not a lawyer and this is definitely not legal advice, but I think the jurisdictions are important and so we are quite lucky that we're based in Singapore. And generally when you're at the really early stage before you've launched a token, before you've decentralized into a dao of know, a lot of our accelerate keys would have incorporated in Singapore. It's super easy and it's also super cheap and very fast. So that's an a very I think globally it's one of the most crypto friendly technocratic jurisdictions so that's usually a starting point. But I echo what Gabriel said, just get a really good lawyer. There's not that many that understand crypto but we can introduce I'm sure all the other guys here can also introduce it depending where you are and speaking to a good lawyer on this is critical.
00:39:34.070 - 00:40:14.014, Speaker C: Thank you. It sounds like the legal environment could use some innovation there as know, maybe we should do a session around that at some anyway, great, great conversation. I really appreciate everyone's active participation and thank you again. We'll hope to do more of these the next session. I want to thank all of you, isaac, Gabriel, Stefano and Blake, because I know for some of you it's really late out there so appreciate to do that on a Friday afternoon or Friday evening or Friday night. And with that we're going to move on to the next topic. Kardik, I give it back to you.
00:40:14.014 - 00:40:17.066, Speaker C: Thanks everyone. Have a good rest of hackafs.
00:40:17.258 - 00:40:23.740, Speaker B: Thanks everybody. Thank you for moderating an amazing chat. So next up we have our next.
