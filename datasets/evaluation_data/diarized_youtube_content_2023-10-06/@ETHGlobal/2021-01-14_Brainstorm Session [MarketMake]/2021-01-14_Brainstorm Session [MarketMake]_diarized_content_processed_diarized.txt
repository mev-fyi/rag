00:00:00.090 - 00:00:38.610, Speaker A: Sometimes it's easy to if you're just waking up, you want to hide behind your camera. But it's nice to see faces instead of names. So if you're able to, we'd love to see your face. It helps me too get to know the hackers. If I'm going to be talking with you for the next few weeks, it's always good to see a face. You all right? Looks like the live stream is good to go again. If you want to turn on your video, you're more than welcome to and we can start.
00:00:38.610 - 00:01:42.414, Speaker A: So, my name is Trent, I work with ETH Global, helping them run hackathons and doing some community management. This is our first hackathon of 2021 and we're super excited to be here with everybody and especially the Ave team. We worked with them last year on a couple of different hackathons and we're really excited to be starting off 2021 again with them. Couldn't be a better partner for these kinds of events. So hopefully you're here for the brainstorm session and you didn't click on an improper calendar event. But this event here today is what we're going to be doing is going over just the general ideas that people have, how you can integrate ave. And we're going to start off with intros from the Aave team and then we'll move into bit of a more open ended Q A session where if you have a specific question or an integration you think might be interesting, you can ask the Ave team that.
00:01:42.414 - 00:01:56.420, Speaker A: But let's start off with some quick intros from the Aave team. Maybe just give your name, the type of work you do with Aave and yeah, let's just start with that. David, why don't you start?
00:01:58.230 - 00:02:21.578, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Hey everyone. So I'm David, you've probably seen me around. I generally do a lot of, I guess, developer ecosystem type things and community stuff. I'm also a general developer and builder as well in Aave, so that's me. I was asked to unmute the other team members. You can go next.
00:02:21.578 - 00:02:22.460, Speaker B: Or.
00:02:25.710 - 00:03:16.330, Speaker C: Stanny here, working quite a lot on the product side and also on a bunch of other more boring stuff on the back office and been building and in kind of the D Five space quite early 2017. And yeah, that's most of the stuff and I love to brainstorm previous hackathons as well. Trying to participate in your idea. So I think important is that if you have something in mind, feel free to share it's. Open place to kind of get thoughts out and just get them further.
00:03:19.070 - 00:03:43.360, Speaker D: Yeah, from my side. I'm Ernesto, I'm one of the core developers of the Protocol in Abbe, but also like participating a lot in product itself. So if you need anything, some people already contact me in Discord and through the common chats we have above. But feel free to ask about anything you want.
00:03:44.370 - 00:03:45.120, Speaker A: Everyone.
00:03:45.610 - 00:04:16.560, Speaker E: I'm Jordan. I'm the CEO of same. Been building DeFi for four years now and very available if you need brainstorming, especially everything related to governance. I would be interesting to brainstorm with you and help or even other things like NFT and then the general products related to anything open to brainstorm, to brainstorm with you and actually quite excited to see what you going to build.
00:04:18.690 - 00:04:20.160, Speaker A: Awesome. Is that everybody?
00:04:21.330 - 00:04:22.726, Speaker B: Just Emilio.
00:04:22.858 - 00:04:54.140, Speaker F: Yeah, there is me as well. I'm another core developer, like Ernesto said, more or less. We were involved in the development of the protocol. We are also involved in the development of other tools and functionalities that are related to the protocol or built on top. So if you guys have any idea or request or you need help or support, build whatever you have in mind, just ask us and we will try to provide the best support that we can.
00:04:55.390 - 00:05:12.644, Speaker B: We also have David K here as well. I don't know if david, you want to say hello? A quick hello if he's got his microphones. If not, that's fine as well. We can move on.
00:05:12.842 - 00:05:43.968, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe we'll loop back and see if we can get him. Okay, awesome. This is great to have so many core team members here to help brainstorm. And like I said, we're going to start off with those intros, which you just did for anybody joining. That was the first part. And now we're going to move into a few higher level questions. We'll talk with the Ave team and then afterwards, if you have a specific question or an idea that you're thinking about, then we'll have time for that as the second part of this.
00:05:43.968 - 00:06:34.128, Speaker A: So let me just pull up those questions we had talked about. Let's start with a pretty big, really high level question. So we had DeFi summer. Well, it's summer for people in the Northern hemisphere, but DeFi Summer six months ago with this really insane explosion and then that kind know, it had its own crash and then it switched to NFTs and then NFTs plus DeFi. And now we're moving into what's the latest thing? Algorithmic stablecoin. So there's these trends that come up cyclically from your position in the space as one of the bigger projects. What is the Ave team seeing in terms of trends that you think are interesting? Let's start there.
00:06:34.128 - 00:06:36.850, Speaker A: And we'll go in the same order. David, if you want to.
00:06:38.580 - 00:07:14.664, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. So from my perspective, because I'm more like, I guess consumer facing with the community. So what I've been seeing lately is a lot of the core, I guess Base Foundation is pretty good these days with protocols like Aave. So we're seeing a lot of developers build on top of these protocols. So there's a lot of composability in DeFi space at the moment. So using Aave with various other protocols, we're seeing a lot of that. Maybe example is Avagotchi or DeFi Save or for a combo.
00:07:14.664 - 00:07:20.590, Speaker B: Those sort of guys are combining multiple protocols into their product. So I'm seeing a lot of.
00:07:22.320 - 00:07:32.210, Speaker A: Great stani and if you don't have an answer for any of these, feel free to just pass. But we can just go through the list. Donnie, you want to give your thoughts here?
00:07:33.080 - 00:07:37.110, Speaker C: So what will be the next thing you mean? Sure.
00:07:38.840 - 00:07:42.070, Speaker A: That'S the question everybody wants to ask. What's the next big thing?
00:07:42.680 - 00:09:25.348, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's something that we as a team always try to think a bit actually quite a lot. And to some extent, it's also like a question, is that when you choose to build something that removes inefficiency and brings a lot of value to the ecosystem, it's also always kind of a bit question of timing. Like, how quickly you can get it into the market, but also secure fashion that you don't compromise the very important elements and risk people funds when it comes to DeFi products. And we do think kind of this and sometimes you might have a very nice idea and a product, but you might be a bit early, too early in the ecosystem with that particular offering and it's not a bad thing because you always have the chance to iterate and make the products better. And I think if you look at Ava as an example, it's not something that we created overnight, it's practically a few years of development and iteration. What's the first version, for example, the very first lending protocol you lend and making it a bit more efficient. And as the ecosystem grows and the narrative changes, what's exciting at the moment it really follows the path and once you add some feature, it's very hard to tell how it will be used.
00:09:25.348 - 00:10:39.208, Speaker C: For example, I mean adding flash loans, we couldn't probably see always what kind of use cases they could be and over the time as the feature was live different developers, including previous hackathons, we saw a lot of interesting use cases and they came actually products. So there's probably 2 billion worth of flash loans used from Ave last year. Let's say most of them are used for example to rebalance different positions in DeFi and arbitrage. So practically bringing a lot of efficiency for the users. I personally am betting quite a lot on the credit delegation functionality. So what's very cool about the version two of Ave is that there's a sort of functionality that you can do behalf of other addresses, other users, practically other accounts. So what you can actually do is that you can deposit into Ave and then delegate your credit to someone else that actually draws the credit so you have the collateral inside and then you form a relationship with that third party.
00:10:39.208 - 00:11:26.590, Speaker C: Now what's interesting here is that this is something that you can delegate to a contract, to some specific pooling contract that does some functionality in DeFi. Could have actually been wider application driving liquidity from DeFi to some other purposes, having some sort of credit scoring. There and having actually utility for the traditional financing and pull liquidity. So that's kind of like layered there. I think there's a lot of opportunities when it comes to scoring and how this credit could be drawn. I think that's something that might we might see some interesting hacks and also developments during this year. Well, let's not say this year, but at least like the next month.
00:11:27.200 - 00:11:35.616, Speaker A: Sure, yeah, hedge that soon. Anybody else from the Ave team want to take a hit at this?
00:11:35.798 - 00:12:49.332, Speaker D: Yeah, I would like to add also that Stani was centering quite a lot in the part of the lending protocol itself. But I think there is something really interesting is the governance part. Like during the last year there was late 2019, there was a big trend on Dows and governance systems. Then it went a bit like say fade out or something by all this deal farming and so on this last year. But I think it's going to come back because essentially it's one of the most interesting fields in blockchain and one of the original ones in Ethereum that coordination of social coordination. So in the case of Abe for example, that we introduced now the stable version of the governance, I think there are really good opportunities to even innovate at base layer of governance systems with new models and build on top of or not. So yeah, I think that it's going to come back once the grid ends a bit in terms of to add.
00:12:49.386 - 00:14:10.096, Speaker E: On what Ernesto was saying, just to give example of what innovation on top of governance can look like, it can be analytics watching which address votes, what are one address that votes? Something that could be interesting is actually when one address votes, like seeing the exposure it adds to other protocol if it participate in other governance. Just being able to make this governance graph. We always talk about social graph, but governance graph like seeing the relationship between votes in different protocol. Then there is everything related to analytics, but also UI. In the ave governance you can delegate both your voting power which makes you kind of politician of the protocol and your proposition power which is like Stanley say like the lawmakers, the devs that can make actually technical proposal. So those two power are separated and basically interaction like social interaction with social media, ways to have social interaction with the delegation of the proposition power is something that is also very interesting. I guess there is a lot and just to have a general answer to the original question, I think 2020 was just like the start.
00:14:10.096 - 00:14:46.488, Speaker E: Now we have base layer protocol like Ave, uniswap sushi, swap all the balancer, all the MMS with different flavors. And I think now those basically 2020 edition of DFI are consolidated and we can start building on top like more robust product that use those building blocks. This is how you should see those DeFi. We always talk about Legos. They are like building block. We see now protocol like the yield protocol building like fixed rate lending. You cannot build something like that if you don't have this basically money market underneath.
00:14:46.488 - 00:15:22.040, Speaker E: So there is so many stuff to build. You just look at the financial industry, the banking industry and you say okay, I need for example, if you take about flash loan, like flash loan in itself is a cool innovation but you need a lot of liquidity to make flash loan interesting. Like you need a protocol, you need an Mm or money market with a lot of liquidity. Then you can borrow like 1 billion in one transaction. So there is a lot of those upper layer innovation that I expect to see now that basically the base layer of the building blocks are consolidated.
00:15:25.100 - 00:15:28.200, Speaker A: Awesome. Anybody else from Ave?
00:15:33.120 - 00:16:26.510, Speaker F: Well, I think more or less everything was said already. One cool thing that we could add, for example to we could think about the governance is the proposals that essentially can execute themselves by gather proposition power so that people could for example delegate proposition power to smart contracts. So that what happens is that the smart contract will be able to automatically execute sorry, create the proposal once it gathers enough proposition power so that anybody essentially can create a smart contract that will be able to propose to the other governance which is something that is for sure very cool. So yeah, there is a lot on the plate I think and I'm personally very excited to see what the builder will come up with.
00:16:27.920 - 00:16:34.610, Speaker A: Definitely. I see we have Mark who just joined. Mark, do you want to say hi and introduce yourself?
00:16:35.060 - 00:17:37.288, Speaker G: Hello, I'm Mark, I'm in the integration team. And the thing I want to add is that the Ave protocol V two is a playground and feel free to play around with the new features, especially to combine them. So you have the flash loan, you have the credit delegation. Some user feedback we had very recently on the social media was how do I transfer my wall position from one address to another address for, I don't know, privacy purpose or wallet management purpose to switch my position to a cold wallet. And it's not something that complex to build with a flash loans, but right now it doesn't exist. There's no feature that allow you that to do that easily with one click on a UX to do it. And that's specifically the kind of small but smart thing that anybody with a bit of technical skill can build inside the hackathon.
00:17:37.288 - 00:18:06.110, Speaker G: And we will do a blog post that we probably will publish tomorrow that will give you small ideas that you can build fast that way that will just make everybody using life a little bit easier. And don't be afraid if you cannot build like huge pyramids of code and very fancy things. There's a lot of small things you can build at any skill level.
00:18:07.920 - 00:18:45.450, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, we're going to move on to the next question, but before that, just something to make sure everybody's staying engaged. If you have your video on, I'm going to pick one of the hackers by random and just give us a quick one sentence intro to yourself. So I'll give 1 second for you to turn on or off your video, depending if you want to talk right now. And then I will pick one person. Why don't we have Marcelo Bardus give us?
00:18:49.360 - 00:19:24.710, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm Marcello. And honestly, I'm looking for inspiration. What to do? Have an idea, but it might be quite complicated to implement. So basically I want to build a smart wallet, smart contract wallet, which should replicate all the transactions banned by a different address. And yeah, it should be something like a politician, but instead of choosing an address which you will give in power, you will do basically the same.
00:19:25.720 - 00:19:27.510, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Yeah.
00:19:28.040 - 00:19:34.410, Speaker E: If anybody wants to join this idea, I'm open. Just DM me. That would be cool.
00:19:35.260 - 00:20:14.790, Speaker A: Yeah. We'll get to the specific proposals a little bit later, but let's move on to the next question. For the Ave team. So we have actually a really huge range of hackers who have staked to build something over the next few weeks. And that's a great thing. We really enjoy seeing people who are just learning solidity to really experience teams. But for us on the support end and for the Ave team, that means that there are going to be people with a pretty wide range of experience levels coming into this and trying to get exposure to your docs and learning how to build something.
00:20:14.790 - 00:20:51.730, Speaker A: Let's say if you were a complete beginner, let's do three levels looking for the response for if you were a complete beginner. So you're just learning solidity. You're intermediate, you've done all the tutorials, you've started to build things. And then the third type of developer would be like you've deployed something to mainnet it's, integrated with some financial protocols. How would you approach this hackathon? Let's get one for each of those levels from somebody on the Ave team and whoever wants to start just unmute themselves and go ahead.
00:20:53.060 - 00:21:31.164, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, I think I can start. So I think if I was a beginner, I think the easiest is obviously depositing and borrowing using those features. But also you could extend it by using credit delegation because it's pretty similar. Right. And they're pretty easy to learn from a developer perspective. As an intermediate developer, think something like batch flash loans or the governance features like delegation and things like that that have already been talked about. And then on the advanced side, you could also do some interesting with all of those as well.
00:21:31.164 - 00:21:48.020, Speaker B: But specifically, Stanley loves this, who would love for someone to look into L two or zero knowledge type stuff. And that's probably for the really advanced devs. So that's what I think. Stanny.
00:21:50.600 - 00:23:26.272, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say others have more this from developers perspective, but I think it really depends on the comfort level. Definitely in a hackathon there's good amount of time so I will not panic too much and maybe might be a good place to challenge a bit yourself and try something new and cool. And end of the day, if it doesn't play out well, you can have a contingency plan. But what I'm trying to say is that there's no stress in the time period. It's long enough that you can achieve pretty interesting things. So it's a good place to challenge kind of your skills and try something very cool and maybe something that normally you won't do that will be and if you're really kind of been doing this and being very deep in ethereum, maybe something like ZK might be a fascinating place to dig deeper. But referring what Ernesto said about, for example, governance, indeed, it's one of basic ideas and some of these basic ideas, there's big issues to be solved in a very large scale.
00:23:26.272 - 00:23:32.036, Speaker C: So pick your yeah, yeah, I'll add.
00:23:32.058 - 00:24:40.712, Speaker A: To that Stannie's basically saying just to recap, don't be afraid to push your limits. If you're afraid know, pick something that's maybe a little bit bigger than your skill set and that will hopefully force you to expand beyond what you're comfortable doing and then to balance that out, do realize that if you are planning something really ambitious, sometimes you can bite off more than you can choose. So be aware that you should probably settle on an idea within the first week of the hackathon. So we'll be having an idea feedback session this week, around this time on Thursday. And by that point I think it's probably fair to say you should have your idea relatively solid and have a good idea of where the direction you're taking it. But yeah, don't be afraid to be ambitious, but recognize that three weeks, depending on how much time you're dedicating to this, if you're only working on it on the weekends or a few nights per week, it can be a challenge to do something really huge. But yeah, definitely ambition is a good thing.
00:24:40.712 - 00:24:49.992, Speaker A: Anybody else from the Ave team want to take a stab at this? The question was the different levels of development. How would you attack it if you were a hacker?
00:24:50.056 - 00:25:44.876, Speaker D: I would like to add also, like in the line of Mark that he mentioned something like that a lot of times there are a lot of profiles of developers in DeFi, that is people that is using DeFi, so is used to interact with platforms, to use tokens and so on and they want to start developing something. So I will suggest that a lot of times it happens that you are using certain products and you notice that you will appreciate to build a small tool maybe to make things more optimal for the interaction. Usually those implementations are not so complicated but are terribly useful. So what looks really small sometimes is like way more used, like a complex protocol with crazy big architecture, way more successful. So sometimes it's not about complexity, it's about simplicity.
00:25:45.068 - 00:25:53.264, Speaker A: Yeah, you can make something really beautiful with just a very simple idea. It's very effective sometimes. Yeah.
00:25:53.302 - 00:26:57.336, Speaker F: I wanted to add that for the more experienced developers and teams, one possibility could even be to add functionalities to the core protocol. For example, if they think something can be improved or new functionalities can be added. For example, I don't know, minting of synthetics assets for example, starting from the Avi protocol or gas optimizations or other functionalities that someone could come up with by looking at the code. That is something that is for sure very useful and appreciated. Ave protocol is open source so anybody can contribute. And if something is added to the core protocol that is very useful, it can become a proposal for the governance to be added to the actual protocol in mainnet. So for the most experienced developers, keep in mind that expanding the core protocol is also an option if you have ideas on how to expand it or how to improve it.
00:26:57.336 - 00:26:58.170, Speaker F: For sure.
00:27:02.620 - 00:27:04.730, Speaker A: Anybody else from the Aave team?
00:27:08.240 - 00:27:11.010, Speaker E: Not on my side? I think everything was.
00:27:11.380 - 00:27:42.490, Speaker G: I can add in the simple stuff that Ernesto said. I have a good example, like one community member Oxport did an apple a day to calculate the factor of position and to have liquidation price. And at the end of the day it's just a little touch of front end very basic stuff and a bit of math. And if you have like zero solidity skill you can produce that and it's super useful and it will find some use case in the community.
00:27:44.460 - 00:28:38.350, Speaker A: For sure. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so for anybody who has hacked with East Global before, you might notice that in previous hackathons these brainstorming sessions were not sponsors but this event is specifically centered on Aave. So Aave is our close partner for this and we are focusing on getting know we're encouraging people to build on Aave and really explore the protocol. And to that end, we have put together some incentives to get people building on them. So anybody who integrates Ave will receive 100 a USDC. Is it aUSDC or AUSD? Let me double check that.
00:28:38.350 - 00:29:03.904, Speaker A: Yeah. Nobody is obligated to build on Ave, but like I said, this is an Ave centric hackathon and we want to see everybody putting their creative ideas out there as to what they can build or integrate with the protocol. And that's one of the incentives. So again, 100 a USDC for any team who builds or integrates with Ave.
00:29:04.032 - 00:29:13.830, Speaker C: And let's not forget that there's also Ave socks. These are mine, so you will get your own but.
00:29:15.900 - 00:29:25.080, Speaker A: Somebody would probably buy your socks. Donnie, I wouldn't be surprised. It's a little weird, but whatever goes, watch them Stanny.
00:29:27.580 - 00:29:29.036, Speaker C: You'll get the fresh one.
00:29:29.138 - 00:29:52.050, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll give that to some of the silo. Okay, let me just see if we had any other questions. Does somebody want to give a quick overview of what V Two actually does? What Ave? V Two? How it's different? Maybe somebody had some experience previously with Ave and they're just coming back. So you want to give a quick overview of what V Two does?
00:29:55.080 - 00:30:55.300, Speaker B: Maybe each of us can go over maybe one feature that excites us about V Two just quickly. Probably the one I'm most excited about, I'd say like maybe credit delegation. So that separates the native credit delegation. So previously in V One we had credit delegation vaults, but now basically all the deposit and borrow functions, you can do it the borrow functions, you can do it on behalf of someone else. So that means that the person that deposits into the protocol doesn't necessarily have to borrow money, but they can delegate that credit to someone else and that someone else can make use of that borrowed money. And whether it's an off chain agreement or on chain agreement, they can enforce repayment of that loan in whatever way they want. People have already talked to me about some really interesting use cases and I think that opens up the design space a lot.
00:30:55.300 - 00:30:57.652, Speaker B: So that's a pretty cool area.
00:30:57.786 - 00:31:41.792, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's important to just to complete what David was saying is that the credit delegation can be done to a smart contract. So it doesn't need to be like credit delegation to an address or like an entity. It can be credit delegation to a protocol. So that's something to keep in mind. And I will just continue with the feature of V Two. Something that is very interesting for me is the collateral swaps. So the idea to swap your collateral, let's say that you are using it or Ave as collateral for your borrow position and then you can swap it to link, let's say, and then be long link instead of being long eat, you can basically trade your collateral.
00:31:41.792 - 00:31:47.210, Speaker E: And there is a lot of things to build around the trading of collateral as well. It's an interesting area.
00:31:53.320 - 00:32:02.530, Speaker A: Anyone else from Ave? So let's see, the futures were credit delegation, what were the other.
00:32:06.340 - 00:33:32.530, Speaker F: No, another thing that is for sure very exciting and is worth investigating and maybe building on top is the Flash Loan version two. Because compared to the initial version of Flash loans of V One, there are multiple capabilities that can be used to create interesting projects or protocols on top. One of these for example, is the intrinsic leverage capabilities that the Flash run version two have because essentially you can take you the money in advance and not repaying the Flash loan like you were doing in Flash loan version one. This is for anyone who has confidence with how the flash run work, but you can actually deposit some collateral in the same transaction and eventually not repaint the flash run, but open a borrow position which essentially brings automatic leverage capabilities. So you can flash borrow in advance, use that amount, borrow it to buy some kind of other asset deposit within the same transaction in the protocol, and open a loan at the end, which means that you can automatically create a leverage position. So this is something that is for sure very cool and interesting.
00:33:35.380 - 00:34:31.010, Speaker B: Definitely just another thing on that because there's some questions on Twitter about that. So what Emilio is highlighting is that the normal flash loans is that you get the money first and then you pay it back by the end of the transaction with the, let's say, debt incurring, flash loans, you get the flash loan first, and then you can choose to deposit the collateral into the protocol after the fact so you can incur debt later on. So it's sort of like the reverse of a normal loan where you would have to deposit collateral first and then you get a loan. So yeah, it enables margin trading type facilities, but then also a lot of other things. Anesthetic do you want to talk about or mark about governance features or any other v two features that excite you?
00:34:32.840 - 00:35:33.956, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean in the governance, I think it was already mentioned before that one of the biggest difference, there are like two big difference with other system of governance out there. And one is that it was designed in mind that there are two different entities participating in governance in terms of delegation. So there are the people that is voting that is receiving delegation power and then there is the people that is actually creating the proposals and proposing to the governance. So we have this difference between proposition power and voting power and I think there can be good ideas to build something from there. And the other big difference with the governance is that how it gets executed. The proposal itself, this is a bit more technical, but we have two different ways. One is just if you have more knowledge of solidity like writing a smart contract, and the other is composing the proposal of chain.
00:35:33.956 - 00:35:40.970, Speaker D: But there are also some interesting possibilities there. It's needed to check a bit more documentation or check with us.
00:35:45.360 - 00:36:32.010, Speaker C: Yeah, one thing I want to mention is that the depth tokenization is also kind of interesting in the sense that when you borrow from the protocol, you basically get depth tokenized position. Those tokens are not transferable, but there might be some interesting things that you could do related to the depth tokens and how to use it, maybe even more than just kind of like accounting and integrations instrument. So might might make sense to take a look at those and kind of like look what could be done.
00:36:34.300 - 00:36:52.610, Speaker B: Yeah, on that. Some people have. Thought about. So on the protocol level, the debt tokens at the moment aren't transferable, but there's a possibility that someone might be able to create some derivatives of debt tokens, so that could be rather interesting as well. Mark, is there anything that you wanted to add.
00:36:54.900 - 00:36:56.240, Speaker G: On this topic?
00:36:57.060 - 00:37:46.880, Speaker B: All right, cool. Maybe the last feature I'll add is also have Staking Aave. So as you hopefully know, Aave, the token has staking capabilities, so you can also create things like that. You can have a look at the docs, but you can stake Ave in our safety module. Then you earn interest on that. And then also as anesthetic mentioned with the voting and governance, it's not just on the protocol level of using governance and helping people vote, but also we have voting delegation features as well or even just analytics around voting because the V two voting is quite new. So we only have our governance interface, but we'd love to see more projects or interfaces around voting governance.
00:37:46.880 - 00:38:02.710, Speaker B: If I want people to delegate voting power to me at the moment, they can do that on Twitter or they can do it through our platform, but it'll be awesome to have that more widely out there in the ecosystem as well.
00:38:07.500 - 00:38:10.760, Speaker A: Definitely. Does that cover everything you want us cover, David?
00:38:13.100 - 00:38:18.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's pretty hopefully perfect.
00:38:18.670 - 00:38:53.930, Speaker A: All right, that was all the questions I had. Was there anything before we move into sort of more open session, was there anything else you guys wanted to cover related to the Ave protocol or integrations that I haven't asked about? If not, just give me a thumbs up and we can move on. All right, cool. I see two thumbs. That's all I need. So this next part is going to be a little bit more participatory. So if you are a hacker and you have an idea, please use the raise hand function in Zoom.
00:38:53.930 - 00:39:31.318, Speaker A: I'm not sure I have the same interface as the host, but it's somewhere on the bottom, I believe. But just raise your hand in the Zoom interface, and then I'll just call on people. What I'll ask is that you just give a very quick intro your name and then try to keep it short enough that you can describe what you're interested in building, but not too short that we have no idea what you're trying to build. So the first person I see is Jack. So Jack, why don't you unmute and tell us a little bit about what you're thinking of building, and then the Ave team will hopefully have some feedback for you. Awesome.
00:39:31.404 - 00:40:08.894, Speaker H: Hey, guys, let me know if you can't hear me. I just want to say it's awesome to be able to bounce this idea off of the entire of team that's here. So thanks for being on this call and for listening to me. So basically what we want to do is build a new type of smart contract insurance platform. We think one of the biggest hurdles in DeFi is all the hacks that have been happening and basically we need to be able to keep the average users value safe. So the way we're thinking about it is there's three parties. There's the projects that we're going to sell the insurance to, we're going to sell it to them basically wholesale.
00:40:08.894 - 00:41:10.950, Speaker H: They're going to pay a small fee, it's going to cover all of their total value. Locked or whatever they want to have covered will just cover it. Then there's going to be stakers on the other side, they put up the capital for the insurance and they're basically going to get one of the highest yields in all of DeFi and we can talk about how we want to sort of integrate that with AV and maybe deposit that capital onto AV. And then internally we're going to have an audit team, which basically one of the biggest issues with insurance right now in DeFi is the pricing is all out of whack, everything's too expensive. And so our team is basically going to be incentivized to go through every project smart contracts and price the risk accurately for our stakers. And in the white hat hacker panel that happened yesterday, basically they were talking about how the auditors and the projects are not vertically integrated. Like you pay an auditor, they go through it and they don't really look at the project.
00:41:10.950 - 00:41:32.670, Speaker H: Again sometimes. And we think this is a way where we can have that team, that audit team, sort of work with projects over a longer term basis and try to keep them safe. So happy to talk about this in more detail. There's a ton of stuff in a smart contract insurance platform, but we want to integrate it with AV and yeah, love to hear your guys'feedback.
00:41:36.930 - 00:41:40.830, Speaker A: Yeah, whoever has some thoughts on that just go right ahead unmute.
00:41:40.990 - 00:41:47.922, Speaker B: Yeah, whoever wants to I think maybe like Stani Jordan or Mark, probably best position, probably know the ecosystem the best.
00:41:48.056 - 00:42:36.062, Speaker E: I think it's you're very like you coin like one of the issue in the whole security and insurance space in DeFi. I think it's based on your pitch. It sounds like a very interesting project. If I can give some idea as well. One of the things that could be interesting is find a way to integrate what you are building with even the governance flow. Because sometimes there is a team that will make a proposal, governance proposal and the proposal contains like payload and that team that build the proposition for the protocol might want to take insurance with your project to say, okay, actually the payload will never have much change. That will be bring security issue in the protocol.
00:42:36.062 - 00:42:55.354, Speaker E: But that could be something that is part I think there is no product at all. There is not many insurance products, but there is absolutely no product that look at the governance activity. Even so, this is just something on top of my head based on what you just said, could be interesting to check.
00:42:55.472 - 00:43:00.374, Speaker H: So you're talking about ensuring new proposal changes or ensuring a new proposal?
00:43:00.422 - 00:43:01.578, Speaker A: Sort of, yeah.
00:43:01.664 - 00:43:20.850, Speaker E: So, for example, a team that make a proposal to governance, that proposal contain code and just like, having a way that when that team comes with the proposal could say, okay, we have also the backing of Senford Insurance and I don't know what's with name.
00:43:21.000 - 00:43:24.740, Speaker H: Yeah, okay. I like that a lot.
00:43:26.870 - 00:43:27.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:27.272 - 00:43:28.420, Speaker E: But good idea.
00:43:31.110 - 00:43:32.100, Speaker H: Thank you.
00:43:37.530 - 00:44:17.700, Speaker C: One thing I can mention something is that the safety module staking at Aave is some sort of kind of like a risk transfer. And one of the interesting things is that if there is some sort of, like, reinsurance or like, further risk transfers or chopping up the different risk in buckets tranches, those are kind of like, interesting topics. Tying the insurance with governance is quite fascinating. I really think that could be a game changer, actually.
00:44:19.350 - 00:44:48.160, Speaker H: Yeah. We've spent a lot of time looking at the safety module, and I read some of your comments about the risk tranching and having, like, mezzanine and Junior and that sort of thing, and that seems like a really cool idea. And the reinsurance part as well. Who's going to insure the safety module stake on Ave? You guys can't insure everything of yourselves, so maybe you need something at some point or reinsurance in case there's excess loss. So we think there's something to do here.
00:44:53.020 - 00:45:05.676, Speaker A: Great. Any other Ave team members want to get some feedback for that? If not. Thanks, Jack. Cool idea. I'm looking forward to see it.
00:45:05.778 - 00:45:07.950, Speaker H: Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it.
00:45:08.800 - 00:45:20.400, Speaker A: Next up, we had VB. I don't think it's vitalik, but I'm happy to hear their idea regardless. You're muted.
00:45:23.060 - 00:45:23.760, Speaker B: Hey. Yeah.
00:45:23.830 - 00:45:52.380, Speaker I: Hey, everyone. So it's Phoebe. Sweets and I mostly work on the front end side of things in the crypto space. So one of the hurdles right now I'm facing is a front end dev. When I'm writing integration tests for your front ends, I'm having to deal with multiple wallets. So we have MetaMask, wallet, connect, et cetera. So my idea will be the tooling category where I'm hoping to build a cross web3 wallets testing framework.
00:45:52.380 - 00:46:22.864, Speaker I: So it will be like a set of utilities that allow one to write tests once and then they'll be able to run against various wallets. And as a demo, I'm hoping to write iteration tests against the Ave front end app. So yeah, I'm not sure if that qualifies as an Ave integration, but I'm also curious to know if the current Ave front end up. I don't know if you have written.
00:46:22.912 - 00:46:23.700, Speaker B: Tests.
00:46:26.040 - 00:46:34.250, Speaker I: To validate the front end app because I don't think it's open source. Couldn't check that.
00:46:37.020 - 00:47:16.584, Speaker D: I think definitely it's really useful. Usually, as you probably know, in this kind of hackathon, people tend to work more in economic parts and so on. But precisely what you are mentioning is like a really weak point right now on development. Even for us. For us it's really difficult right now. We have like as you probably saw, there are like ten wallets or something like that. Some are using Wallet Connect, the others are native on the browser, the other is ledger, the other and it's a lot of troubles for users, for example, specifically ledger and so on.
00:47:16.584 - 00:47:54.770, Speaker D: So I think it will be really good and for sure we are going to support you gladly at the end if you don't have the tooling. It's impossible to build the mature products. Sadly, in this ecosystem, it's still not the highest priority. So yeah, go for it. Right now we don't have on GitHub our client, but we can work on that to make you like to give you access or however we do. But for sure we will support.
00:47:58.800 - 00:48:24.760, Speaker B: Cool. Yes, an excellent. So reach out to us directly and we can see what we can do with the front end client code. Yeah, we get a lot of support issues with various wallets. So yeah, definitely would want to see you build something like that. But Trent, you're muted.
00:48:25.280 - 00:49:02.124, Speaker A: Classic. Anybody else from the Ave team want to give feedback on that? Yeah, definitely. I mean, like it was said, sometimes people tend to focus on a flashier financial integration, but tooling is really crucial and actually some of the we've had finalists from previous hackathons who just build like a Vs code integration or some sort of tooling that's really useful but hasn't been built yet. So definitely a good idea. I believe we have Samuel up next. Hello everyone. I'm muted.
00:49:02.124 - 00:49:03.050, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:49:04.780 - 00:49:06.536, Speaker E: Can you hear me clearly please?
00:49:06.718 - 00:49:07.450, Speaker A: Hello.
00:49:08.380 - 00:49:09.130, Speaker C: Okay.
00:49:10.700 - 00:49:53.130, Speaker E: I was actually thinking why can't we kind of use I was thinking of using DeFi for insurance in terms of real world examples. Like example trying to put DeFi in terms of health. I don't know the pandemic that is going on right now around the world. People actually need to kind of insure their health. I was thinking of building something related to that, but I'm still trying to see how I'm going to figure that out for medical insurance, kind of I don't know if you think it's something possible, but it's an idea that's been ringing through my head. I'm thinking of how to implement it.
00:49:54.780 - 00:49:55.192, Speaker A: Sure.
00:49:55.246 - 00:49:55.464, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:49:55.502 - 00:50:35.504, Speaker A: I think the one tough thing with health records and health data is there's a lot of regulations surrounding how you handle that data. So if you're doing any sort of Mainet ethereum integration with health records, it would be a pretty big challenge to actually do that properly and without breaking the law. I'd be curious what other people have to say. I know people come from a lot of different backgrounds and if you have some healthcare experience, but that's my basic knowledge. So it might be a challenge to do something related to insurance on chain without using something like the zero knowledge groups to obfuscate the data or disconnect it from accounts.
00:50:35.632 - 00:50:43.960, Speaker H: You do have to use anonymous Identifiers and any private health information in most first world jurisdictions can't go on chain.
00:50:44.540 - 00:51:29.590, Speaker E: Yeah, I think if I can add there is like two things that I can think of. Basically one of the issue in insurance is getting the liquidity to ensure getting the capital. So this is for example, the way I see the case for the credit delegation. You could have some smart contract that gets credit delegated liquidity for the insurance but then you definitely need a part that is off chain basically to breach the real world and not necessarily bringing health data on chain but managing basically as if you were building health insurance company but your capital comes from dupi in the background. I think that's the easiest way.
00:51:31.180 - 00:51:32.490, Speaker F: Okay, thank you.
00:51:32.940 - 00:53:22.520, Speaker C: To add to that, definitely that's interesting point because if you get this streamlined liquidity, you can stream your liquidity with credit delegation. It practically gives competitive advantage to new kind of innovation in the financial technology space. Practically the front end business models, insurances and whatnot because you can start up some sort of a product insurance product and get liquidity from D five if you get the credit delegations and DeFi industry excited. And regarding the data, it's all about kind of like risk, right? So I guess when you go to the personal level, help data and so forth, it's a bit challenging but there's quite accurate applications and software where you can track how for example, some viruses spread, let's say how COVID is spread in a particular area and then increase and decrease the pricing of the insurance. So, let's say if you will be in Finland and because the COVID hasn't spread that much here, the pricing might be cheaper but when the person goes to UK, the pricing changes because if you are in an area where there's a lot of cases and so forth so it could be quite interesting. But also as insurance, insurance is pretty much derivatives as a financial instrument. So you could create derivatives to pretty much anything.
00:53:22.520 - 00:54:25.656, Speaker C: I could imagine one industry particularly, let's say you have rockets, right? You ship rockets to space, launch rockets to space, and in each rocket, let's say Falcon axis going up. There is quite a lot of different other companies there. They have their nanosatellites, various components and they cost millions, at least hundreds of thousands. Just the product. But all the research and development involved in getting that thing up and those are kind of the very high risk industries that I don't know where they get their insurances, but could be interesting where where you will have a market to something like that. I mean, if they go to orbit and same for let's say using kind of like health in a more less personal way, but for example. Imagine the help thing that if you are in an area where there is a lot of kind of like accidents, then the insurance cost is different and then.
