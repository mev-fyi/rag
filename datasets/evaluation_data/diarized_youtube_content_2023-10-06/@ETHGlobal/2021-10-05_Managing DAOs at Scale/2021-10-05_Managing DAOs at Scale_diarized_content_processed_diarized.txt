00:00:05.770 - 00:00:37.282, Speaker A: With that, we are ready for our last talk of the day. And for that, I want to welcome these four amazing people. So we're going to talk about managing DAOs of scale, and this is going to be from the perspective of managing anyone from Decide Trust foundations to grant programs. So we have Julia from worker protocol, larry from compound grants. We have Corbin from Ave Grant and Eva Bailing from the Graph Foundation. They're going to cover all things Dow, anything from on chain to off chain to legal, to complaints to Tooling. And it's going to be a really fun talk and discussion.
00:00:37.282 - 00:00:44.140, Speaker A: So without further ado, I'd like to welcome all of them here and get us started. Welcome, everybody.
00:00:48.220 - 00:00:48.970, Speaker B: Hey.
00:00:50.620 - 00:00:51.370, Speaker C: Hello.
00:00:51.820 - 00:00:53.210, Speaker D: Thanks for having us.
00:00:53.740 - 00:01:14.850, Speaker B: I'm so excited for this panel to talk all things Dows. I know everyone here wears many different hats, so I kind of wanted to give everyone the opportunity to just give a quick intro and talk about all the things they have their hands on in the crypto space. Larry, you want to kick us off?
00:01:15.380 - 00:01:49.868, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So, I'm Larry. I'm the co founder of Reverie and also the program lead for Compound Grants and a quick background on myself and Reverie. I mean, I was a VC for three years, and we started Reverie because as me and my co founder, he was also a former VC. And we just thought Dows are really cool, and we thought Dows could be trillion dollar organizations, but it wasn't enough for us to just say that. Sort of had to roll up our sleeves and work for them. And so one of the first things we did is we left our jobs and started working for Dows and we did things like Compound Grants and a bunch of other cool things.
00:01:49.868 - 00:01:53.470, Speaker D: And that's what we do. We invest in DAOs and we work for them, too.
00:01:55.780 - 00:01:57.520, Speaker B: Amazing. Eva.
00:01:58.340 - 00:02:14.470, Speaker C: My name is Eva, director of the Graph Foundation. I was part of the initial team that launched the Graph Protocol. We're currently exploring how to transition to a Dao, but prior to that, I worked very closely with Molokdao and even Dow House. So have been around the Dow space for some time.
00:02:16.280 - 00:02:19.460, Speaker B: Thank you, corbin hi, everybody.
00:02:19.610 - 00:02:51.404, Speaker E: So I'm corbin. I'm currently at Consensus, where I help lead product for all of our fintech products. And then I also spent a lot of time with the Aave community, mostly with the Aave Grants Dao. So we've deployed, I think it's over a million dollars at this point, to various projects that help kind of grow the ecosystem. And it's just been like a great learning experience to see how a Dow can be as impactful as a major software company. Right. This is a totally new type of organization.
00:02:51.404 - 00:02:59.860, Speaker E: We're trying to figure out how to make this work from the ground up. So excited to share learnings and jam with you folks on a good Friday afternoon.
00:03:00.280 - 00:03:25.500, Speaker B: Amazing. I think it's so interesting that all of you kind of sit in different parts of the Dao ecosystem. Like, Corbin, you're in the grants ecosystem. Eva, you're helping transition to graph into a Dao. Larry, you help provide services to DAOs, I guess what are just sort of the biggest pain points you guys see as you help grow these Dao ecosystems?
00:03:29.680 - 00:04:14.140, Speaker C: I can go ahead. So something that we're seeing just starting from a foundation that gives grants and sort of has these external contributors. So in a sense, emulating a Dow, but in a centralized format is figuring out how to scale the real life aspects of jobs that people actually need from Dows as well. So something like knowing that you're going to have a full time job, not because the Dow is going to not vote you in again next quarter, but because you can maybe continue working as long as you're not fired from the Dow perhaps. And thinking through what are those tools that need to exist that aren't a technology problem? It's like people safety problem for them, committing to whether it's a protocol or a Dow community, but long term, so they're not just like a short term contributor.
00:04:16.960 - 00:04:46.032, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree with that. It's always a human thing. Or even like little things. Like if you're starting at a new company, you're going to probably discuss your offer, how much money you're going to get with what? Like an HR person, your private boss. And in a Dow setting, it's all public. That's kind of awkward, right? It's just a weird sort of thing to do to discuss your salary in a public forum that any one can see and then potentially someone's going to tweet about and then everyone just knows your salary, which is awkward. And so just dealing with those sort of things is super necessary.
00:04:46.032 - 00:05:16.690, Speaker D: And with compound grants, when we started it, we didn't really think this through. We didn't know that's going to be an awkward sort of thing. And so the way it ended up working out though is in private, we sort of had to discuss with the grantees, hey, how much do you want to get paid, what's the hourly rate? That sort of thing. And then in public we would say what the final sum was, but not all those sort of details. And that really just makes it more comfortable for people to join, which hopefully lowers their barriers to entry and gets more people working for Dallas. But it's always a human thing.
00:05:17.540 - 00:05:49.748, Speaker E: Yeah, I would second that. I think it's absolutely fascinating because we're basically reinventing organizations from first principles. Everybody says the same thing about DeFi. We're looking at the financial system, we're looking at what it's providing from first principles and rebuilding it with the internet on chain. We're doing the same thing with corporations, foundations, nonprofits with DAOs. Right. All those types of coordinating bodies for humans are being reinvented now that we have the Internet and these awesome types of tools.
00:05:49.748 - 00:06:41.620, Speaker E: And so that is a very messy process. We're figuring out what's working, what's not working. Like these folks said, what should be public, what should be totally public, what should be private because it's more of a human matter, right? And then at the same time, the tools to do these things aren't purpose built for Dowels, right? Like, Chris Dixon had this great post the other day that we're in the kind of like schuomorphism phase of Web Three and we're applying traditional structures to this new movement, right? We're talking about Dows as if they're a software company, right? But they're very different than a software company. Right? There is no W two. Right. All this Dow tooling that folks are working on, we're using kind of the framework of things that we know from the traditional world, but Dows might end up operating totally differently. And so now we're using that as a reference.
00:06:41.620 - 00:06:58.480, Speaker E: We're trying to make it work here and then we're also constantly evolving it. So even things like signing transactions, coordinating people, figuring out salaries, all that type of stuff is going to need to be reinvented. And that just takes a lot of iterations and it's going to be messy in some cases.
00:06:59.700 - 00:07:32.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that a big issue we see is the definition of a Dow and what that thing is, is constantly evolving. I'm kind of hearing that's. What you're saying, Corbin, is know, we don't actually even know what this thing is yet. How can we be applying old tools? But also we still do need to be applying those tools to it. So I guess also just to take a step back, why do we even care about Das? Why is this so important for us to be working on and helping develop these tools?
00:07:36.880 - 00:07:59.368, Speaker D: Like a year ago, I was chatting with the founder of a company. I was an investor and asking for the cap table. And then I opened the cap table and there's like four people there. It's myself, three other guys, and him. And this guy has like hundreds of employees. I thought it was weird and so I hit him up and I'm like, hey, why are you so greedy with your employees? That's kind of weird. They should get some upside.
00:07:59.368 - 00:08:52.550, Speaker D: And he tells me and I should note this guy, he's in Southeast Asia and he tells know in our know, employees don't want equity, right? The idea that, hey, I can work for a startup and make a bunch of money on this piece of paper is not a really fully formed idea in many countries, right? And we're super lucky in the US. Where there's fully formed startup markets and parts of Europe have that too, but most of the world does not. And I think with DAOs, right, we literally have that on a global basis where people over the world could get ownership in this network and potentially make a lot of money and have life changing wealth through really contributing to the world through really cool products that make the world better. And so if there's one thing that gets me excited about Dows, it's that globalization of wealth and these opportunities that mostly folks could read about on TechCrunch and stuff but never experience for themselves.
00:08:54.920 - 00:09:47.268, Speaker E: Yeah, I totally agree with that. I think in terms of the accessibility, you're seeing the exact same trends in crypto kind of apply to organizations with DAOs, right? So accessibility, like literally for the Ave Grants Dao, we're spinning up like a developer's Dow as part of the Grants Dow. And so they're going to help contribute functionality to the core protocol, working with the Genesis team, spinning up improvements, parameter tweaks, adding new assets, that type of thing. And I was hoping to do some of those interviews, and I hop on Zoom one day, and it's like an 18 year old dude from Nigeria who just is a smart contract whiz, right? And I was like, looking at his GitHub repo beforehand. I'm like, Holy shit, this guy ships. Right? This guy knows his shit. And I never would have talked to that individual if we were running a know in the States.
00:09:47.268 - 00:10:09.980, Speaker E: Like, you just don't have access to that talent pool, or maybe he would have been too intimidated to apply. And so it's like that open door is where I see a lot of the benefit of DAOs. Just like in DeFi, one of the benefits is that you have a global audience on day one that anybody can start contributing to. Right. The same kind of ethos is instilled in DAOs.
00:10:11.120 - 00:10:38.580, Speaker C: Yeah, I echo everything Corbin and Larry said, and I would add, Dows let us coordinate almost around a mission, something larger than just an entity. Whereas, like a private company, the only people who care about what the private company does are, like, the shareholders of the people that work there. In a protocol, you can have literally hundreds of companies full time aligned to that protocol, and a Dow can be that framework to coordinate them in a way that aligns them to something larger than just their own private interests.
00:10:40.760 - 00:10:58.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with all those things as well. I do think that sort of the ideals of a Dao are very different than the reality of today, which I think we can all sort of agree on. So, like, Corbin, to your point, do we actually think that Dows are accessible today?
00:11:00.560 - 00:11:46.552, Speaker E: Yeah, that depends on who you ask. I feel like I know other developers who feel know they're sharp developers and then they haven't been able to get into any of the DAOs they've been interested in because maybe it feels a little bit more clicky. Right again, all organizations are different shapes, different sizes, and have different gateways. And so I think yes and no. Frankly, if I could wave a magic wand. I think we need to unbundle this term Dow because a DeFi protocol dow has very different needs, users, accessibility than a dow spun up to invest in NFTs or a dow that emerged around your favorite podcast. Right? We're calling all of these things Dows but they all are very different types of organizations.
00:11:46.552 - 00:12:02.130, Speaker E: They do have certain things in common, right? Like we try to be internet native, we try to have code as law and there are certain principles that flow through them all, but they're very different organizations. And so even the term dow could means ten different things to ten different people.
00:12:04.660 - 00:12:29.400, Speaker C: I agree with that. I'd also say that dows ultimately are just communities and the dow is kind of supporting that community. So if someone's struggling to enter Dows because that community might have high barriers to entry and a lot of the coordination even between people is currently still off chain, it's maybe discord or a forum. So there's some real regular social improvements that can be done just to even improve dow engagement.
00:12:31.180 - 00:12:57.840, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. I'm sure everyone sees those funny tweets like is a group of friends paying for dinner a dow? Right. Or is like a group project a dow? And it's like, well, we don't really know what a dow is, but we know what a dow is not. Right. And that sort of gets us halfway there. But I think over time, this sort of stuff, 20 years from now, we won't probably be arguing about what's a dow, we'll figure it out. It's like one of these growing pains that we all have to deal with in emerging industry.
00:12:59.780 - 00:13:16.970, Speaker B: Yes, I think this is an issue that continues to come up is like what is the dow? What is it? But how do we sort of create standards and move sort of processes and tools forward if we don't have a fixant definition around this thing?
00:13:19.900 - 00:13:50.836, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm happy to jump in on that one. I think we were actually chatting about this before we hopped on. Ideally the tools get configured around the needs and goals and operating processes of the organization. Actually, we just had the Zodiac kind of demo before this panel and I'm a big fan of their approach. Right. Because security is the top concern built on top of nosis safe which is very much battle tested. But then you have kind of like an open ecosystem of plugins that you.
00:13:50.858 - 00:13:51.988, Speaker D: Can attach to that.
00:13:52.074 - 00:14:27.710, Speaker E: Right. Capital is kind of like the lifeblood of any organization and then so having very different rules for modifying how that operation actually runs and having that as an open system that anybody can kind of use what's there and it's what has worked for Dows in the past. Or build your own if you need something that's more tailor made. And so I think the platforms that are going to win, the platforms that are going to own B to D or D to D commerce are going to be the ones that are configurable to make sure that the tools work well for the type of organization that needs to use them.
00:14:28.580 - 00:14:34.210, Speaker B: Well said. Gary eva, do you have any thoughts on that?
00:14:36.980 - 00:15:19.152, Speaker C: I generally like in practice, I'd say maybe the Urine ecosystem has really figured that out. There's a tool called Coordinate that was literally created out of the Dow's need and is now the most used way of coordinating sort of rewards and acknowledging the actual contributions within the Dao. And I don't know if Coordinate is actually the best tool for every Dao. Right. It kind of just worked for the Urine ecosystem because of the way they kind of spun out. But I echo Corbin's sort of sentiment that I suppose even if you're using the same Dow framework, the Dows you create might be completely different. I would say the original Malik Dow is very different.
00:15:19.152 - 00:15:38.260, Speaker C: That was supposed to be simply funding e two is very different than MetaCartel Ventures that now is a full venture fund. It even has these off chain connections to enable the actual participants to have ownership over the Dow. And so even when you take the same smart contract, the actual execution might be completely different. It might require different tools.
00:15:41.020 - 00:15:58.990, Speaker B: Awesome. I want to talk about grants programs. I know you all sit on grants programs in different ways, so sort of why are grants programs an essential part of Dow ecosystems today? And why are we seeing so much development around them right now?
00:16:00.720 - 00:16:46.916, Speaker D: I can start on this one. I think a lot of people are so confused about grants programs. It's like, why do they exist? Right? Maybe illustrating an example for Compound could be useful. But when we started Compound Grants, which was, I guess early this year and maybe February, March prior to that, if you were into discord or if you were just an active comp token holder and you're really just interested in contributing. And you needed money to either quit your job or have some sort of financial motivation to do the work. You shouldn't be working for free. You basically have to write a proposal on the forums, lobby people to pay you money publicly, and then wait for this weird governance process that could basically take seven days for you to get paid out.
00:16:46.916 - 00:17:28.184, Speaker D: Right. And that is a crazy barrier to entry to get like $25,000 to do a little project. Right. And so with Grants, the idea was, hey, let's create a pretty centralized organization which is called the Multisig that basically creates a process for people to get paid super quickly. Right? And that was the idea. And the longer term motivation is, well, hey, there's maybe 1000 or 2000 or however many people in the community that are active, and maybe some subset of them could actually be full time contributors one day, but we just don't know which ones they are. So what if we provide grants to a lot of them, see who is capable and who actually delivers on what they say they deliver and do that for a period of maybe six to nine months.
00:17:28.184 - 00:17:57.600, Speaker D: And if that experiment is successful by the end of it, we'll know, okay, well, this person, they asked for $25,000. They shipped, like, $150,000 worth of code. These guys are fucking killers. Maybe we should hire them full time. And that's funded by grants. And so that was sort of the motivation for grants, and it's worked really well so far because it's such a simple thing that makes the user experience for the grantee really enjoyable compared to especially the inverse of that, which is governance.
00:17:59.460 - 00:18:27.310, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree. We've also seen that proven where we've had a number of grantees now become full time contributors. Either, like, another team will hire them, or they'll get just paid a long enough grant to be full time. So it's clearly proof that a grant is a really low key way to start dipping into a community without proper commitment, because people leaving their full time jobs, especially in web two to web3, is still pretty scary. So grants being, like, a really good hybrid solution to that.
00:18:27.680 - 00:19:19.196, Speaker E: Yeah, I would jump off that, and I think Eva's going through it right now. I see grants as, like, a really critical point in the progressive, decentralization process where you're just saying, you know, we obviously could keep this capital closer to our organization, but we're not, because we want to decentralize, right? We want to incentivize contributors, we want to grow our ecosystem, we want to grow our number of integrations, and we want to basically open up our KPIs to anyone around the world to kind of help us meet. Right. Which is a really cool thing to do. I also don't necessarily think that this first wave of DFI grant experiments has gone far enough. I'm very proud of what we've done at Ave Grant. I think we've funded over 30 projects, built all these kind of cool folks contributing to the ecosystem, but it's still decently hard.
00:19:19.196 - 00:20:04.276, Speaker E: Right. I think we have two tiers. So if it's over 100K, you still have to make a post on a public forum, and we gather Ave community sentiment, and maybe it goes through. If it's less than that, then it's like the Ave reviewers that are taking a look at your application, setting up milestones and then payments, right? Maybe we need more than just two tiers. Right? Maybe if it's less than two K, anybody around the world can just point to evidence that they did something like had a thoughtful take on risk analysis for the protocol or went ahead and built out the integration, and now I'm retroactively applying for a grant to get compensated for doing so. Right. So I think, again, we took grants from the traditional world model of we have a bunch of capital.
00:20:04.276 - 00:20:41.140, Speaker E: We want to grow the ecosystem. All right, grants. I think we can now take it a little bit further and say with crypto, we can do all these programmatic things that we couldn't do before. So what does a grant actually mean now? Maybe we need a whole bunch of other experiments and different tiers to continue to get other people involved. But that said, I think it's been relatively successful with what you've pointed out with part time work. Like, half of our grants come from people that are holding down a full time job. And it is like the best gateway drug in the world to get people moving crypto into web3 is through Grants because they're like, oh my gosh, now I have crazy upside to this protocol.
00:20:41.140 - 00:20:51.160, Speaker E: People love me here. They're posting memes about me. People are excited to use my tool. And so I think it's another great gateway for getting talent into the ecosystem.
00:20:52.140 - 00:21:29.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I think those are great points, Corbin. And I think what I've noticed is there's really interesting activity happening in sort of this siloed grants, sort of this part of the ecosystem, unlike these grant programs. I think Ave is a great example of what you're working on at Ave Grants and seeing the amount of subcommittees that are forming underneath Ave Grants and seeing where there's activity and like, okay, how can we provide resources to those little nucleuses of groups? Can you speak a little more specifically to some of the initiatives that you guys are spinning out?
00:21:29.960 - 00:22:34.104, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. So the two key ones are really the developers dow and then the risk Dow, right? In terms of a Dow that's going to be governing a major DeFi protocol, lending credit, the total addressable market of something like that is absolutely massive if you look five years out. So what is the specialized knowledge that you want to cultivate internally to manage that growth, to manage that as it scales? The first one everybody turns to, because we're all nerds, is developers, right? Like, we need more software, coders are going to solve the world, we're going to automate everything away. And so we've started off with this developers dow. And if anybody on this call is a developer and wants to get involved, please apply Avegrants.org. We basically are going to take off some of the load from the Genesis team, right? And this is core protocol functionality. This is tier one stuff, but we're going to start opening it up to anybody that has solidity or scripting or JavaScript skills around the world.
00:22:34.104 - 00:23:03.460, Speaker E: So we're really excited about that one. And then the second key one is risk, right? We all know that monitoring the risk of these systems is so important, especially as crypto assets continue to be volatile. We have crazy up, crazy down days every couple of months. We got to be able to react to that. And we need a lot of thoughtful, very specialized expertise around risk. And so I believe we have a risk Dow that's spinning up too to make sure that the protocol can scale and meet all its goals.
00:23:03.960 - 00:23:34.220, Speaker B: That's amazing. I think it's interesting because I think every Dow is trying to get developers and community managers. I think those are probably like the two most in demand kind of professionals right now. But what makes getting just a small grant from one of these programs a compelling offer for these extremely in demand users or these extremely in demand professionals?
00:23:36.660 - 00:24:26.430, Speaker D: I could maybe chime in here. In my experience, the grantee archetypes, right? There are several core archetypes and everyone's basically trying to get something different out of the Dow, out of a grant. Sometimes there's a company that maybe has a good idea. It's pre venture funding, but it's a company, it's formed and the people are like, well, it'd be awesome to get some non dilutive capital, build something for the Dow and just kind of work together and see how we're vibing, right? That is a clear use case for that archetype. It's a clear use case for the Dow. It's like a group of folks working on something cool, great, let's give you some money. And so that's definitely a huge bonus for people in that position.
00:24:26.430 - 00:25:11.820, Speaker D: There's people who are like, I'm not sure if I'm a good dev and I just want to try something out and I want to test my skills. Right? And it's like you're getting paid to improve your skills. That's great. Why would you not do that? And by the way, a lot of these grants programs, they promote you on Twitter, right? So if we give you a grant at compound grants, we'll promote the heck out of you and we want you to find a cool job, of course, at Compound protocol after. But if you want to go somewhere else, we want to promote you too and we'll actually give you opportunities to get a gig elsewhere. So a lot of it is a lot of people just want to break into the industry and they want to improve their chops a little bit by working on something. And then there's just people who are just they are really good at what they do.
00:25:11.820 - 00:25:32.150, Speaker D: They don't like having a boss and they're like, I could work for like six, seven Dows basically as a contractor, do really good work, get paid a bunch of money and do that. And I am a nomad and it's a good lifestyle for a lot of people too. Those people are really good professionals and there's all sorts of sort of archetypes in between. But those are, I would say, the most common ones I've seen.
00:25:33.560 - 00:26:15.890, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd agree anecdotally it's been mostly individuals, contractor types, although I predict that we're going to see a lot more entities. So we definitely have a lot of grantees that are like dev shops that are doing something, maybe building out a product, but I foresee us doing a lot more Dow nesting in the future where maybe it's like a security Dow has received a grant from the mother Dow. And maybe that security Dow is then like five security teams working for this protocol. And so it might know in the future be even individual, kind of like Larry said, archetypes. Like, we might see a Dow that represents every single archetype just because that's the service that's needed at that time.
00:26:16.820 - 00:26:52.892, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say Larry covered the archetypes really well. I have nothing to add there. What I would say is I think the space needs to evolve also beyond just right. Like at the end of the day, community is everything behind these things. If folks have energy and some amount of talent or at least accountable for certain things, we can probably figure out a pretty good job for you. Just I don't think anyone's scoped out what that job means for a 22 year old communications major that just graduated, right? We could probably find something useful for them to do. It just hasn't popped up yet.
00:26:52.892 - 00:27:23.910, Speaker E: So devs and community managers are definitely towards the top of the priority list. But I also think we need to think about what roles are important. And you're seeing this flush out on very active discord servers a little bit, but there are curator roles or, I don't know, hall monitors, some type of role that you don't need crazy dev skills or management skills or security auditing type skills to do. And I'm not sure, I haven't seen a ton of great experiments there yet, but I think they'll come.
00:27:24.520 - 00:28:20.730, Speaker D: Yeah, I think Corbin brings up a good point, which is like, not going to name any names, but I've seen DAOs where it's know, hey, anyone can come in, get some free money, right? Let's go, let's go. And there's really no focus on scoping the roles and you see the forums and the work product and it's all kind of disorienting. It's really just confusing. It's a cluster, right? And that's not to say something of value won't get created there, but man, if you are a focused person or if you're an ambitious person and you're like, I know what I want to build, just give me the resources, you're not going to want to work there, right? And so I think scoping, hey, here are the roles the Dow needs. Here's what we are building towards is necessary. And then every now and then if you find someone who's too good to ignore, you want to fund them as well and give them a little bit more of a free rein. But it is a struggle, I think, to scope those roles appropriately in a Dao environment and we all got to get better at it.
00:28:23.180 - 00:28:36.248, Speaker B: What do you think is like a specific skill set that DAOs aren't attracting now that they need to be like, I know Corbin mentioned a. Few. But can you point out specifically what some of those roles might had?
00:28:36.274 - 00:29:23.624, Speaker D: Just we had just hired someone at the radical community, a governance facilitator and the role was basically inspired by the maker governance facilitator role. And long story short, I mean, for a more mature Dow, there's going to be many different working groups, just like a company has many different groups. And you basically got to make sure that the dominoes fall in the right order, right? If you have a product and you're shipping a product, maybe you want the engineering team to ship it by date x the marketing team to pick it up from there. But you basically have a factory right, to run for a complicated product. There's many different working groups and making sure everything is running on time is the job, I think, of a governance facilitator. So it's almost like a program management role. But you basically need someone there to be lashing those whips.
00:29:23.624 - 00:29:37.650, Speaker D: And if people are not delivering on time right, they got to be told that so that everything is running on time. And so I think that is the role I've not seen many Dows do. But it's so critical and so necessary because it keeps the train running on time.
00:29:39.720 - 00:29:40.084, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:29:40.122 - 00:30:37.284, Speaker C: Another role I'd add is PMS. Technical PMS or product PMS? Because most of these proposals or the teams behind these proposals aren't good at doing the proposal writing. Like it might be a really technical engineering team. And so it really goes a long way to have a really well formatted proposal like having know done the proper due diligence for the community, whatever it might be. The concern or I guess the unsolved problem here is how do you properly incentivize PMS? So right now, for example, in the Uniswap ecosystem, a lot of the people sponsoring the proposals are very large uni voting power holders, whether they're delegates or they are uni holders themselves. So that's one way to align those incentives. But I think there's maybe even a better way to incorporate PMS as part of the Dow contributor process and for us to kind of all accept that Dows don't eliminate the middleman or kind of the middle management of shipping products and getting things done.
00:30:37.284 - 00:30:39.350, Speaker C: They just allow us to coordinate better.
00:30:42.040 - 00:31:13.920, Speaker B: Amazing. I feel like the general sentiment of those answers comes back a lot to just the onboarding process of a Dow, which I think we've all sort of identified in this conversation as one of the weaker points of how we actually turn engagement and excitement into contribution. How do we sort of better facilitate that and better facilitate people who might be interested into actual real valuable work in these ecosystems.
00:31:15.300 - 00:31:50.860, Speaker E: Yeah, I can jump in there first. I think you just described a new role, right? This is your first day, buddy. Maybe easy role that anybody in the Dow can take is like new member ushering in education set up a call, talk through how they want to contribute, why they're interested. Maybe that's the new role. I know for me personally, it's my own problem, but I'll join a Discord, and then there's like a whole big list of things I have to go through, and I have to interact with a bunch of bots, and then maybe I already own their token, but I have to verify it. And I'm just like, oh, my, I just go back to something else.
00:31:50.930 - 00:31:51.164, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:51.202 - 00:32:37.148, Speaker E: And that's bad, right? We should do better. I think that this is a tooling problem, like we were discussing earlier. We've got to have better tooling that meets the needs of the different type of organization. What if somebody puts my Dow in their bio on Twitter and just tweets about it all the time? Maybe it's even, like, thoughtful tweets on what could be better, what they're working on, how they're contributing. They're a new Dow member, and they should be onboarded somehow, right? And so I don't necessarily think Discord is going to solve it. Maybe some other chat type tool comes out that solves it. But I think we need to figure out how to make participation as frictionless as possible and then people to get feedback right away.
00:32:37.148 - 00:32:51.250, Speaker E: Like, first, you know, shout out a like, they get swag, they get something, they get an right. To create that excitement that's like, this is a community I want to be a part of. This is where I want to be.
00:32:51.860 - 00:32:56.130, Speaker D: Corbin, I'd love for you to be my first day budy at Aave. Where do I apply?
00:33:04.760 - 00:33:08.100, Speaker B: Eva. Larry, do you guys have any thoughts on onboarding?
00:33:10.200 - 00:33:52.420, Speaker C: I hate to say it, but, like, crypto, Twitter, Discords, it really starts with getting involved in the community because it's really hard to be employable if you don't know what's going on in that protocol. That's kind of the unfortunate situation now is there still is quite a bit of education ramp up that needs to occur. So I'd say getting involved in those forums and that is like, public knowledge. I think it's just us even sharing that these forums exist. On the other Web, two platforms we should be talking about, the E Three search forum on LinkedIn, there's all these developers on LinkedIn craving crypto content, and they don't know where to find it. So maybe there's just, like, more crossover we could be doing between those platforms.
00:33:55.000 - 00:34:25.500, Speaker B: Amazing. A topic I always like to talk about around Dows is what does leadership look like in DAOs? I think in this sort of Dao ideal, we talk a lot about decentralized, power, control, ownership, all these things, but there's also been a little bit of pushback on that and that leaders are important in these Dow ecosystems. What do you guys sort of think about leadership in Dows?
00:34:28.320 - 00:35:22.636, Speaker D: Maybe I could speak about my experience here, but this would be more focused on the larger Dows. We're part of right, which are primarily the DeFi ones. I know we sort of discussed about what really is a dow, but I'm talking about maybe some of the larger ones, not some of the social token ones. But the way I think of this stuff is there's formal governance power and leadership power, which is like I own 10% of the company or I'm on the board of the company or on the multi SIG. And then there's the informal, which is we're all a group of individuals at the end of the day and there's a social hierarchy and some people have more command and control and some people have less right. And none of this stuff is ever documented. But if you go to the forums and you see the founder posting, they may not hold more tokens than everyone else combined, but they definitely hold a lot of social credibility.
00:35:22.636 - 00:36:24.150, Speaker D: And that credibility is used for governance power. You see a lot of this sort of stuff with traditional companies where maybe the founder left or has no formal position, but whenever there's the CEO saying something and the founder comes in and says, hey, I disagree, people generally look at the founder for control and governance. And so I think a lot of this stuff is tricky, right? And at the same time though, a lot of it from the traditional world kind of maps over because we are just groups of people coordinating around projects and groups of people always have some sort of informal ties with each other and that sort of tie is the governance power. But I think generally though, it's good practice for a young early stage project for the founder or the founding team to use that informal power to sort of shepherd the community towards a certain vision. And that's the easiest way to just coordinate a group of individuals to build something special. But curious what everyone else in this panel thinks too.
00:36:24.840 - 00:36:47.820, Speaker B: I'm curious too, because I think what we've seen in a most recent experiment in Loot was the sort of leader of that ecosystem, realized his soft power in the ecosystem and that was actually taking away from the potential vision of the group. So I'm curious Corbin, if you guys have any thoughts, more thoughts on leadership.
00:36:48.400 - 00:37:40.668, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say that know, in productivity, regardless of a dao or whatever, it like there usually is a team. Like at three people there's always a leader even so, like I think there's always going to be these micro leaders, maybe for a specific objective, maybe for a specific grant or team. And then we don't necessarily need some kind of overarching leader because the point of these protocols is that they're actually so multifaceted that we need everyone's domain expertise. You're not supposed to have one centralized entity that is controlling it on the counterexample. Or maybe proving of this example is So Kane, he was on the Spartan Council left and then was asked to come back. And so he has been a leader this whole time. But just because he was a leader doesn't mean he was then an autocrat or some kind of centralized figure, simply that he was good at leading specific initiatives and the community respected that.
00:37:40.668 - 00:37:42.670, Speaker C: So I think that that's possible.
00:37:43.680 - 00:38:35.710, Speaker E: Yeah, I would piggyback off that and just say the leadership also evolves with how the Dow matures, right? So take a DeFi Dow. They're going to be going through a progressive, decentralization process. Ideally, the founding team or the founder should be seeding control over time as it's appropriate to more people in the organization. And what's interesting is that's what success looks like for DAOs versus it's generally not what success looks like in traditional tech startups, right? It's like, oh, we want to be founder led through the IPO and all that type of thing. So Kane's a great example. Maki from Sushi. I think there are a couple others that are like that benevolent leader, which vitalik is the archetype, I think, of the benevolent leader who's like, yeah, I will take a step back once the organization can kind of run on its own.
00:38:35.710 - 00:39:30.652, Speaker E: That said, I think it's an art more than a science, right? Like, you got to know when to weigh in, when not to weigh in. I think the uniswap core team has had to make that decision at some points with different proposals that have come through. So yeah, I just think we're seeing it evolve. The last thing I would say is I like to think that Dowels promote a merecratic type system a little bit more than traditional organizations, right? You might have a non users or pretty much everything has a time step online. Whether it's chat or your actual PRS, everything is recorded with these organizations online. And so it's very clear who's doing the work and who's doing a lot of the thought leadership and whatever politicking still exists. I like to think that it's less so than a traditional corporate structure where it's like drinks after work, get you the promotion.
00:39:30.652 - 00:39:39.990, Speaker E: So it's an art more than a science, it's still evolving. But I like to think that Dows are a little bit more flat and fair than what came before them.
00:39:40.680 - 00:39:57.930, Speaker B: Yeah, I think on the other end of the spectrum too, like, we're talking about extremely good, productive contributors in these ecosystems. What happens when we have bad actors in these ecosystems? Like, how do you handle bad actors in Dows that are potentially creating problems?
00:40:01.760 - 00:40:45.928, Speaker C: That's a tough question. I guess one way that we've sort of tried to manage quality at the foundation is not paying out the full grant up front. So we'll do 20% up front the rest of the 80% upon completion. And that kind of weeds out anyone who didn't want to work. And you do kind of pay a small cost perhaps, but they also take on a reputational cost. Like they're a team maybe we won't work with again or won't recommend. Similarly, like we saw today with Robert Leshner, there's ways to sort of intrinsically and reputationally bring someone to be more altruistic than they otherwise were that are also part of the incentive formula, but just aren't simply like a Dow grant that is incentivizing.
00:40:45.928 - 00:40:54.560, Speaker C: That good behavior. So I think there's a lot of social ways to manipulate perhaps a bad Dow actor on chain to be better off chain.
00:40:56.660 - 00:41:17.828, Speaker D: Yeah, certainly Milestones GABA mentioned work really well. But then to double click on that social point, I think it's like a little like company culture where some companies have this vicious culture, and if you're a dick, people allow you to do that versus some other companies. If you're being a prick, they fire you, you're gone.
00:41:17.914 - 00:41:18.550, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:19.240 - 00:41:40.060, Speaker D: And I think it really does require the Dow to sort of have an informal or even formal social contract. Here's our code of conduct right here's, how you behave if you're commenting in a forum and you're being addicted to people, we're just not going to take you seriously and the moderator is going to ban you. And it's like little things like that, it feels so obvious. But it's necessary, I think, to set up for a Dow context.
00:41:40.960 - 00:42:12.996, Speaker E: Yeah. The last thing I would say is I'm not saying that a token always makes sense, but a great thing a token does is it aligns interests of the token holders. Right. So a bad actor is going to be less likely to be there if they're working against the goals of the overall group or they're being disruptive or they're slowing things down. Right. Because that is the most powerful kind of incentive mechanism that these things have. And then if you remember way back in the day, one of the original innovations for Malik Dao was like the rage quit.
00:42:12.996 - 00:42:34.370, Speaker E: Right. Because if we aren't getting aligned or if I'm a petulant child, that we absolutely have to do this and everybody else is going the other way. I can take my toys and I can go home and I can rage quit. So I think, again, we're evolving these mechanisms in real time. And frankly, bad actors is one of those things we're going to have to figure out.
00:42:36.740 - 00:42:53.956, Speaker B: Sounds fair. Okay, last question of the day. We have to wrap up, but what do you hate about your Dow setup right now? Corbin, we were joking about some pig points you were experiencing before, but what is terrible in your Dow setup right now?
00:42:54.138 - 00:43:13.276, Speaker E: Yeah, I think, Julia, we're going to go over now because I'm just going to start multi. SIG signing is the worst ever. Oh, my gosh. Like a bunch of telegram pings. And first thing I do when I wake up in the morning, I log on, see what's up. It's like, oh, my God, I got to sign eight transactions. There goes, like, 30 minutes of my day.
00:43:13.276 - 00:44:27.664, Speaker E: We just got to figure out maybe a better coordination mechanism or maybe it's a UX problem and we should experiment with ideas like assumed signature if you haven't vetoed within a 48 hours period or something like that. I think there are all types of things that multi SIG of seven of nine is probably not the end game of the space here. So I think that's one easy one. Governance actually gets a lot of attention, right? So I think that problem is on its way to being solved, right? Like, how do we coordinate better and actually have thoughtful discourse on a proposal and get it voted through? But it's also still a shit show today, right? Like boardroom and tally, do a decent job snapshot. But we also see proposals get to a far stage without core people paying attention because there's just so much stuff going on, right? So thoughtful thinking about governance and voting on it and having really good, solid delegates is something that needs to continue to improve. Capital allocation, treasury management, all those things need to improve. How we explain this stuff to Normies is another great one, right? Anytime you say, oh, I contribute to a Dow, they're like, the Dow, like that big hack, like, oh, I remember that.
00:44:27.664 - 00:45:00.780, Speaker E: It's like, no, it's not that. But dows are still around. They're actually pretty cool. You should contribute. If these things do go mainstream, probably around social tokens or streaming about these organizations, around content creators is kind of how I think they'll go mainstream. We need better ways of introducing these concepts, these tools, these ways of contributing to normies. So all those things from the minute, like signing multi sigs to explaining these things to the real world in a way that they'll rock.
00:45:02.160 - 00:45:11.536, Speaker B: Yeah. So Corbin has basically laid out there is no room for improvement in Dow. Larry Eva I think we should just.
00:45:11.558 - 00:45:42.060, Speaker D: Come up with a new term like Dow sucks. Can you imagine being like, in 2044 and still saying Dows? It sort of feels like saying introweb in 2020. No, you don't say that term. So to Corbin's point, just the marketing of Dows, I don't think most people intuitively understand what a Dow is when they hear it. And so just trying to simplify the messaging a little bit, I think could go a long way to making Dow just more accessible to Normies.
00:45:46.110 - 00:46:24.440, Speaker C: Maybe. One thing I'll add is I don't think we've quite figured out what a Dow holds as liability in itself versus its participants. And I don't think we've had that many examples to explore this space yet or not that many very large capital inflows or outflows. But there could be a time where a government regulatory agency or really just people are upset about some behavior that a Dow grant has achieved, right? Maybe it's funding some malicious behavior, but the Dow didn't realize it was malicious at the time. And then who is liable then? And how do you then protect maybe your Dow members from being the ones to incur pain?
00:46:26.650 - 00:46:38.678, Speaker B: Yeah, really good points that I don't think gets talked enough in these Dow discussions. Well, Eva, Corbin, Larry, thank you so much for this panel.
00:46:38.854 - 00:46:43.260, Speaker A: I think before we end, Julia, what is your answer to that same question?
00:46:44.750 - 00:46:53.390, Speaker B: The lack of accountability in Dao systems. People need to face repercussions for their actions in DAOs.
00:46:56.530 - 00:47:00.946, Speaker A: I wanted to dig more into that, but should have started off with that.
00:47:00.968 - 00:47:01.540, Speaker B: Question.
00:47:03.830 - 00:47:06.740, Speaker D: Julia's, like, fire the bad guys, fire them.
00:47:08.310 - 00:47:32.650, Speaker A: We have a force quit function instead of a rage quit. Amazing. Well, Corbin, Eva, Larry, and Julia, thank you so much for that amazing chat. Before we end, let's kind of go in order and just quickly say how people can get involved in each of your organizations and DAOs and communities and how can they find or contact you after. Start off with Corbin.
00:47:33.230 - 00:47:47.326, Speaker E: Great. Yeah, I'm Corbin page on Twitter. Reach out about anything. The biggest things are go to Avegrants.org and apply for a grant. There are a bunch of RFPs on there, there are a bunch of things that we need. So take a look at the list and see if anything speaks to you and apply.
00:47:47.326 - 00:47:57.490, Speaker E: Please do. And especially if you're a developer, check out the developer Dow. We're literally hiring folks in the very near future, and so come contribute and get involved.
00:48:03.240 - 00:48:21.340, Speaker C: So the Graph is for non technical and technical people. So if you are interested in running a node, get involved by being an indexer. If you're just a front end, full stack developer, you can build a subgraph. If you're just know interested in the crypto ecosystem, you can be a curator and use your knowledge about apps in Earn, GNT and the Network.
00:48:24.480 - 00:48:45.920, Speaker D: Mary for Compound grants, you can always go to Compoundgrants.org. Always apply to us before Ave though. Just saying. And if you just want to message me, I'm at Sakurnik at Telegram. You can ping me at any time. I'm joking. You should apply to both Ave and the Graph and Compound everywhere.
00:48:46.080 - 00:48:53.910, Speaker A: It's not a zero sum game. This is awesome. And Julia, lastly, we'll end off with how people can get in touch with you.
00:48:54.600 - 00:49:08.076, Speaker B: Yes, I didn't get to introduce myself, but I'm co founder of Orca Protocol. We're building tools for DAOs. Check us out on Twitter and join our discord. We are gearing up for launch, so lots of exciting updates to come.
00:49:08.258 - 00:49:30.108, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, thank you so much, everybody. And this marks the end of today's summit. Now, we had the Ave Grand style summit yesterday, and the next summit is next Thursday with Compound grand. So we'll give the same people both opportunities to have watched both, but we'll see you all next week. And in the meantime, for everybody participating at the hackathon, happy hacking and see you next week. Enjoy your weekend.
00:49:30.108 - 00:49:31.184, Speaker A: Thanks everybody.
00:49:31.382 - 00:49:32.990, Speaker D: Thanks for having us. Thanks.
