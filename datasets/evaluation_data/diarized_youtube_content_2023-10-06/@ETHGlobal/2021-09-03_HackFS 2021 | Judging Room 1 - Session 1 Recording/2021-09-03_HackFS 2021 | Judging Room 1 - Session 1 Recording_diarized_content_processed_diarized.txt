00:00:44.260 - 00:01:24.084, Speaker A: Okay. Welcome, everybody, to the hack file system, hosted by ETH Global. We're going to get started right now. Um, so this event had 650 hackers from 61 different countries in 18 different time zones. And the way we're going to judge today is four minutes for a demo, three minutes for questions with the judges, and a ten minute break every six to eight teams. And the criteria is pretty simple. We're going to be judging on technicality, originality, practicality, the UI design, and the wow factor.
00:01:24.084 - 00:01:54.850, Speaker A: Of course, just noting that this is not a competition. We're just here to learn and to explore what is possible. And we're not aiming to become businesses. And hackers are here to get feedback from the judges. Now, I'd like to introduce Bernard and Emmanuel as our wonderful judges. They will be giving you feedback today, and if the first team is ready, we can go ahead and get started.
00:02:12.940 - 00:02:15.850, Speaker B: Hey, Mike, we don't have audio. Would you mind sharing that again?
00:02:29.580 - 00:03:19.364, Speaker C: The value of an NFT is derived from its unique story. That story includes how the token was minted, press about the artist or team trading, and on chain info, certifications related items, and a lot more. But right now, there isn't a way to provably tile of that data to the token. That's what Fungiproof is here to solve. Fungiproof is a grading and enrichments platform for the metaverse that enables NFT collectors and creators to aggregate and show off everything about their token that makes it stand out from the rest. It does this through a user friendly experience that lets anyone upgrade customize and continue interacting with their NFTs long after they've been minted. Over the last few weeks, our team has combined many of the amazing platforms and technologies involved with Hackfs to create our first functioning prototype for NFT enriching.
00:03:19.364 - 00:03:20.890, Speaker C: Let's check it out.
00:03:21.900 - 00:04:07.670, Speaker D: The initial screen for the Enrichments demo is an NFT wallet dashboard. The demo is built on top of the Mumbai Polygon testnet. So first I'll connect a wallet to the Mumbai network and connect to the DAP. Once connected, the wallet's NFTs are retrieved from the Covalent API and cached into a textile threaddb collection. All the tokens displayed in the wallet were custom built for this demo and minted on Mumbai. Clicking on a token grades the token if it hasn't already been graded, and takes you to the token's profile. The profile view displays the token's grade, the token's image wrapped in a paper case enrichments, which are available for purchase, and the token's event history.
00:04:07.670 - 00:05:09.536, Speaker D: Once a token's been graded, owners can encase their token. Encasing a token places all the token's data into a ceramic registry file and ensures the information about this token will never be lost. In case tokens can further be enriched in this demo, we've implemented the ability to upgrade a token's grade by backing up its assets directly to filecoin and tying that back up to the original NFT through an enrichment contract. Once enrichments have been applied to a Token, we can view all the Token's data. The data includes the hash to the Token. The Token's registry file its grade, including all of its upgrades and all of its associated enrichments. We display the event change log containing all the events that have occurred to this NFT.
00:05:09.536 - 00:05:54.096, Speaker D: This event log is made possible by querying all the ceramic commits made to the NFT's profile and outputting the change in timestamp that occurred for each commitment. Lastly, I'm going to talk a bit more about the tech we built that powers this DAP. The first is a new contract standard we're calling a nonfungible enrichment. NFEs are an extended ERC 1155, where the 1155 Token can be bound to another NFT. Once bound, the owner relinquishes control over the Token and gives it to another NFT. The second is our ceramic registry. The registry acts as an NFT index where NFTs are stored using their did as the key and an associated ceramic tile for each NFT's profile.
00:05:54.096 - 00:06:24.460, Speaker D: The entire registry in each NFT is pinned, and once it's available, it'll be archived to filecoin to ensure the data persists. In addition, we plan to use the NFT did provider in the future to enable the NFT's profile to be editable only by the NFT owner. For our data backup upgrade, we combine the power of web3 storage and our nonfungible enrichment to create a backup for NFTs, which is immutable and provable. We believe this functionality is critical for the NFT space to prevent lost NFT assets and rug pulls.
00:06:31.580 - 00:06:36.760, Speaker A: Thank you so much. We'll be moving on to the Q A and feedback with the judges.
00:06:44.880 - 00:07:01.170, Speaker B: All right, well, I guess I'll just shooting it. Great. This looks awesome. This is obviously a very relevant topic. You talked a little bit about new standard and how you tie that to the NFT. Can you elaborate a little bit on that and how you see that standard being adopted by others?
00:07:01.780 - 00:08:17.960, Speaker D: Sure, yeah. So the idea is that we basically can take an 1155 NFT and be able to mint various different types of items, things, and we're starting out specifically with cases and then the backup to kind of prove the concept. But the way that it works is it starts out as a regular 1155, and then we added an enrichment method and a couple of other methods to the contract. When you call the enrichment method, you pass in another NFT, so probably like a 721, for example, or another 1155, as long as it's non fungible. And then when you pass in that NFT, it binds it to that NFT as the parent, and then it actually burns it for the original owner. So the idea is that the owner of that non fungible enrichment is then the NFT, as opposed to the personal wallet address. I think I could definitely see it being adopted by other platforms, especially gaming platforms or other marketplaces and we could see the ability to tie all sorts of external information and certifications or really any relevant information about an NFT to an existing NFT.
00:08:17.960 - 00:08:24.652, Speaker D: And it's just something we don't see or we haven't seen yet. So I think it could be really useful or helpful for the space.
00:08:24.786 - 00:08:37.552, Speaker B: Yeah, very cool. Thank you. Amazing one, guys. I think it's really interesting for me to see that you walked across very extended time zones, and I would say kudos to you on that for pulling this off.
00:08:37.606 - 00:08:40.370, Speaker D: Good one, appreciate it.
00:08:43.140 - 00:08:46.470, Speaker B: That's all. Awesome.
00:08:50.120 - 00:08:58.810, Speaker A: Thank you so much. We'll now be moving on to Team mdtP. If you're ready to present, please share your screen.
00:09:01.180 - 00:09:23.532, Speaker B: Just doing that now. Cool. I'm starting. This is our presentation on mdtP. So our team is comprised of myself and Christian, both long term friends and crypto enthusiasts. Right. Our inspiration for the hackathon is Million Dollarhomepage.com.
00:09:23.532 - 00:10:00.488, Speaker B: It was created in 2005 essentially as a virtual ad board, where the creator sold 1 million pixels for $1 each in ten by ten pixel blocks. It went viral at the time was a huge success. However, the Internet has come a long way since. And so earlier in this year, during the Fglobal NFT hack, the idea for Million Dollar Tokenpage.com was born, which for brevity, we're now calling mdtP. Here we represent the 10,010 by ten pixel blocks with 10,000 ERC seven two one NFTs, which can be bought, sold and traded through OpenSeas Marketplace. As with any other NFT, owning an NFT then allows you to update its image and content on this large content board as often as you like.
00:10:00.488 - 00:10:38.688, Speaker B: Our vision is for mdtP to be a long lasting project that takes on a life of its own through the community. We want to support the site for as long as possible until one day ideally outlives even us. For this to happen, we need to decouple as much of the site from our servers as possible. mdtP is primarily a front end and blockchain based DAP. However, we have our own back end for performance reasons such as caching the content data. Up until now, we've also kept much of this data in our own s Three buckets, but in this hackathon we've made it such that all our content is now stored on IPFS. We've uploaded both the NFT metadata and the grid's default data to IPFS and pinned this using Infura.
00:10:38.688 - 00:11:25.888, Speaker B: Meanwhile, for all user uploaded content, we're now making use of the Web Three storage library to send it over to IPFS Two. So enough chitchat, let me run you through a demo. Our basic motto is interact, trade and share. As you interact with the site, you can select a token and view its content on the side panel. You can then mint new ones or bid on those that have already been sold, and update any that you own. And through our handy little menu here, it's super easy to learn more about the project to share it or join our community channels. So I'll run you through an example of Minting, which is what most new users will do, remembering that we're still in beta and running on Rinkobe.
00:11:25.888 - 00:12:05.924, Speaker B: So to begin with, you can select any token that's yet to be taken, such as this one, and then I can select Mint and either Mint a single one or Mint a group. Minting is as simple as just submitting this transaction, but I'm actually not going to do that because I don't want to wait for the transaction to go through. Instead, I'll just jump down here where I've already Minted a group of tokens and set them to JayZ's crypto. Punk updating the Minted tokens is then dead simple. You just fill in the fields that will show up here in a SEC. The title, the description. Here we go.
00:12:05.924 - 00:12:59.760, Speaker B: The title, the description. I'm going to set the height and width to all nine tokens, change it to Keeping It Real with F Global, upload the image just to make sure it's the right one, and select Update, and we'll have the transaction go through. Now all this content data will be uploaded to IPFS through the Web Three storage library, and our back end will simply cache it in the background. While we're waiting for that to happen, I'll just roam around a little so that you can see other things that we've got on the site so far. It's mainly projects. Oh, okay. And if I go to the token, you can see there, it's updated keeping It Real with F Global.
00:12:59.760 - 00:13:32.956, Speaker B: Right. So now that you've seen the demo, you can see that the site is almost finished. We're working on some final touches and hope to launch on Mainnet by the end of the month. Our key focus now is really on building community, and considering we're both devs, there's quite a learning curve here. But our goal is to make a long lasting and vibrant community, and we're certain then time will get there. Take note that what you've seen is just the start. We're hoping that the community will actually do all sorts of creative and exciting things with this virtual content space, and we'll continually adapt and build tools for their ever evolving needs.
00:13:32.956 - 00:13:52.070, Speaker B: So, yes, thank you for listening. Please follow us on Twitter, jump into our discord channels, and try out our current beta by simply visiting the site, remembering that it's on Rinkobe. We're giving out free NFTs for those who mint now while we're in beta, so please jump in now and invite your friends and followers. Thank you.
00:13:53.560 - 00:13:59.960, Speaker A: All right, we'll be moving on to the judges'feedback. Thank you very much. mdtP.
00:14:00.780 - 00:14:18.124, Speaker B: Thank you. Emmanuel, you go first this time. Yeah, I was hoping you would have a question to ask because I just want to confirm that you mentioned you started building this at the NFTs hack. Right. Okay, great. Just that great. UI by the way.
00:14:18.124 - 00:14:30.192, Speaker B: Amazing. Impressive. Actually, the UI has been the majority of our problems. NFT stuff is relatively great. Great. All right. Very cool, guys.
00:14:30.192 - 00:15:13.868, Speaker B: This is awesome. Been a big fan of the original, so I think you're doing an amiable job of approximating it, if not exceeding it, which in it by itself is an awesome feat. Question for you guys. How do you see this project going on as a community project? For example, to change, to make multiples, to have DAOs basically create new virtual spaces based on your contribution and take off from there. Very cool. Actually, this is one of the things we discussed the most internally with me and Arthur, and what we're hoping to start with is like, a space for NFT owners to show off their NFTs. Right? So there's a lot of these new animal based my favorite ones, the camel, so far, the animal based ones.
00:15:13.868 - 00:15:57.352, Speaker B: So then hopefully we're hoping to create a dow around that. Right? So once the tokens are taken up, then we as a group decide what features we want to add and what the direction is next. I think one of our strong thesis is, like, the NFT world at the moment is this kind of like collectible and artwork. There's like two things happening, but as time goes forward, it will be very much like we see it going into many more kind of real world use cases. And how that reflects onto here, I think, is something we can't predict. So really the answer is I don't know. But the answer is very much to make it a part of the ownership of a token, which is one of the reasons that we are quite limiting on how many times people can mint, how many tokens people can mint, and how much you can own within a block.
00:15:57.352 - 00:16:13.744, Speaker B: We want there to be lots of ownership and lots of ideally different types of projects on there so that it takes an interesting direction rather than just being collectibles. But that is where we want to start. Very cool. Very cool. I'm going to keep following the project, for sure. Very well done. Thank you.
00:16:13.744 - 00:16:15.090, Speaker B: Very cool. Thank you.
00:16:20.040 - 00:16:27.910, Speaker A: All right, thank you so much. We'll be moving on to team Nifty. If you are ready to present, please share your screen.
00:16:40.260 - 00:17:07.752, Speaker E: Nifty is a geolocation media anchoring. DAP leave favorite memories in emotionally trigger locations. Digitize your time capsules for future loved ones to uncover. Graffiti your name, your favorite print for others. To mesmerize, let the physical world be your showroom. It's where Pokemon Go meets Facebook. With Nifty, you can explore a digital layer on top of the physical world around you.
00:17:07.752 - 00:18:03.500, Speaker E: It's a decentralized application where you can explore the metaverse of creators mapping their digital content, art or media to physical locations by way of GPS coordinates. For digital creators, the application will allow them to clean a GPS coordinate and imprint their favorite media. It's like Graffiti, but for digital content. But unlike Graffiti, it's a clean way to express oneself. And unlike graffiti, you can sell, buy or market the content earn an audience likes, views and clicks and monetize these statistics by receiving a share of advertisement revenue for digital billboards placed in close proximity for consumers. Nifty will be a physical media platform where entertainment means traveling with friends and strangers to discover new content and a place to earn and speculate on NFT treasures. It's decentralized and censor resistant.
00:18:03.500 - 00:18:42.840, Speaker E: Nifty is built using decentralized technologies so that no one party can hold a claim to the infrastructure and content. Nifty allows creators to mint digital content as NFTs through use of smart contracts. The digital content is forever stored on IPFS by way of NFT storage. The geolocation GPS coordinate layer is stored on ceramic for geography, proximity, mapping and filtering. Fluence is used as the compute layer. Superfluid Finance will be used to rent billboards. Here's a short demo of the front end application built with React.
00:18:42.840 - 00:19:19.376, Speaker E: To use the application, you will need location services turned on. We'll see three views explore, Feed, and Mint. Explore is where you see all the NFTs around you. Feed is where you see the actual content of those NFTs around you and you can also interact with the content, view other details, descriptions and titles. Then you have the Mint view where you can mint a token. Right now we're minting with MetaMask wallet in the Covan network. What happens in the backend is that the image is first stored on NFT storage.
00:19:19.376 - 00:19:44.030, Speaker E: Then the NFT is mint using the Uri of NFT storage in the Covon testnet, which is going to be polygon next. Then after that, ceramic is holding the GPS location. And then we'll use Fluence to retrieve that GPS data so that we can map it in our Explore function and also retrieve that feed content as well. Thank you.
00:19:52.820 - 00:19:57.590, Speaker A: Okay, we'll now be moving on to the judges feedback. Thank you very much.
00:19:59.560 - 00:20:19.176, Speaker B: Very cool. Interesting, super interesting project. I got a question for you. Explain to me a little bit how that billboard rental is going to work. You're on mute. Mike, can you hear me now? Yeah, sorry about that.
00:20:19.278 - 00:21:05.240, Speaker E: The rental is still on. I still thinking about that, but it's going to be with Superfluid finance. I think the way it would be basically what I think is the advertisers would choose the location where they want their advertisement to replace their billboard to replace they'll be able to see the statistics on the NFTs around, so they'll be able to place their statistics in a GPS location. They will mint an NFT for them and then as long as they pay their, what's it called their cash flow on a continuous basis, then they'll hold that spot. Then from there, once that cash flow is paid out to the application, then the application will distribute those funds to the NFT holders in the surrounding area as well. Does that answer your question?
00:21:05.310 - 00:21:14.824, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Very just that's the potential of the project moving towards yes. Very cool. Okay. Gotcha. Awesome. Very cool.
00:21:14.824 - 00:21:15.416, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:21:15.518 - 00:21:16.468, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:21:16.654 - 00:21:23.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the only thing I want to add is pretty impressive that you put this off during the course of the hackathon. And kudos on that. Great work on this, man.
00:21:24.130 - 00:21:25.070, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:21:25.520 - 00:21:37.340, Speaker B: And you had me checking my doors here to see if these are weird doors you are opening and closing. Oh, sorry. No, it's fine. I'm just saying, from the demo video, there was the sound of closing and opening doors.
00:21:37.500 - 00:21:40.390, Speaker E: Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
00:21:41.160 - 00:21:44.612, Speaker B: It's just fine, man. Yeah. Great job, man. Great job.
00:21:44.666 - 00:21:45.430, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:21:48.140 - 00:21:54.650, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Nifty. We'll now be moving on to team two. C publisher. If you're ready, please present.
00:21:57.180 - 00:22:26.820, Speaker B: Okay, sounds good. Yes, we can hear you. Okay, so let's get started. Welcome to Bio Publisher. Bring your own front end and publish it. Political regulations and censorship have no power here, or at least this is what we want to believe. Truth is, our beloved Web Three ecosystem has serious blind spots in regard to true censorship resistance.
00:22:26.820 - 00:23:34.120, Speaker B: Interacting with the blockchain is not a trivial task. That's why we are putting all efforts to bring great user experience through our front end applications. However, a big part of the architecture of many DApps requires traditional Web Two centralized solutions. This is potentially a problem that could affect thousands of users if a restriction policy is deployed. This is bad news, but there is still hope. My name is April Ninja, and it's an honor to present you the Bio Publisher team, confirmed by Alonso Vargas Rodrivera and Alvaro Grant, a team of Costa Ricans who want to make the Web a better place for all of us, where no one can harm our right to participate in it. Inspired by Web Three storage and ceramic IDX, we designed a concept that allows the user to upload their front end and DAP files to IPFS, making them available to everyone everywhere, but at the same time giving them the capability of being signed by a trusted team developers.
00:23:34.120 - 00:24:30.760, Speaker B: With Biopublisher, you can use your own user interface to interact with any smart contract out there by using Webtree storage platform to host the static files of a DAP. For this hackathon, we built a proof of concept for file uploading functionality so users are able to upload and check the information of their DApps in an easy way, making them ready to be verified by any identity management system, such as Ceramic IDX. In the future, Biopublisher is intended to be part of a suite of scripts that will allow the users to securely identify any published tab by a trusted network, making it easier to choose which tab is a good fit for them. For any increase, feel free to contact us at hello at two C IO. Thanks for your attention.
00:24:35.500 - 00:24:40.460, Speaker A: You thank you very much. We'll now be moving on to the feedback portion.
00:24:45.690 - 00:25:53.710, Speaker B: So Ben and you can go first please. Okay. Very interesting, very interesting approach. I really like that. Taking the blind split out of Web Three, that's very much needed. Can you expand a little bit on how you get the interface bindings to all these different smart contracts? Okay, so right now we are leveraging the Web Three storage to communicate to APFS and that is happening via the corresponding API that is being integrated into our front end by creating an extra layer, the bio record, to make sure that we can save the metadata accordingly. By itself it sounds like a file uploading tool, but the purpose is to integrate it with another solution that will make sure that we can get a trusted resource based on using idea ceramic graphs.
00:25:53.710 - 00:26:59.746, Speaker B: I'm just so interested, how do you get the trust that the saved interface is actually the appropriate interface? Okay, so right now this part is part of the next steps, the future projects. But yeah, right now the purpose is that we will then have using the IDX and ceramic have another solution that will be presented by another team so that we can have trusted groups based on the different front ends. Each user belongs to a specific group and that group will be then select the front end that is secure. So basically a way to make sure that the front end that we are presenting is secure enough once it deployed. Got you. Thank you. I think the only thing for me is just to confirm that you've been working on this for a very long time now.
00:26:59.746 - 00:27:35.286, Speaker B: Like you didn't just do this for the hackathon only, right? Sorry, can you repeat the question? You've been working on this for a while now, right? Yeah, we have been working in this. Great work man. Pretty impressive, well done. Thank you. Hello everyone. Let me share my screen. Hello everyone.
00:27:35.286 - 00:28:03.626, Speaker B: So today I'll be presenting Carava.org, a modern scientific publishing platform based on IPFS. So, about the team. I'm Yugo Rossel, a friend cybersecurity student based in Luzanne I'm solo team since all my friends were on vacations. So since I'm about to graduate, I spent a lot of time on Archive.org this summer and I realized that was platform that had a lot of problems. So first off, as a little bit of context, archive.org
00:28:03.626 - 00:28:46.326, Speaker B: is a major player with 1.2 million visitors a day, top 2300 websites, but with centralized servers and a review process that is non transparent. There are also concerns about censorship. So I put two articles here, nicola Jisin from University of Geneva wondering about whether students were being blacklisted from the platform. And also a personal story by Brian Joseph Ston, a Nobel Prize winner in physics whose article was kept in review for too long and then misclassified. So as a solution, I present Kaivat.org, where we can host paper on IPFS.
00:28:46.326 - 00:30:05.994, Speaker B: So we inherit all the very nice properties of IPFS, like vault resistance and everything. The review process is community based, a bit like Wikipedia with funds, with staking funds for CBL resistance and things like quadratic funding to avoid people with too much capital being able to vote too much, and also potential for experiments in new forms of scientific funding using NFTs, for example. So what has been done during the sagaton? Parse the scientific taxonomy and create a modern web application. So the interface is 30 year old, so it was not that hard to create something a bit more enjoyable to browse. So upload 1.9 million metadata of articles on IPFS and index them correctly to display them on the website and download all the scientific papers starting from 2012 and being slowly uploaded to IPFS and an experimental feature mint paper as an NFT. So what's next? I grossly underestimated the time that it takes to upload more or less 1 data of source and PDF files to APFS.
00:30:05.994 - 00:30:44.222, Speaker B: My connection was bad during the summer and one had a better connection. It was already too late to do it in time. We should define and deploy community based reviewing process and improve the web application. So let's jump right into the demo. Here we can see that we have the taxonomy clearly laid out. So let's take a look at computer science, for example. Here you have a little explanation of the category and then you have the recent articles that were appeared.
00:30:44.222 - 00:31:25.520, Speaker B: So you can expand as a Pragmatic solution. Since not all the papers are uploaded on IPFS, you can check them out on Archive now and you can browse by year and by date, by month quite easily. So, in conclusion, the application is itself hosted on IPFS webflik you can visit today@caribat.org. My GitHub is here. Stars and PRS are welcome. It's a difficult problem and I would gladly welcome some help. Thanks a lot.
00:31:29.430 - 00:31:33.730, Speaker A: All right, we'll be opening it up for questions with the judges and feedback.
00:31:34.950 - 00:31:56.374, Speaker B: I mean just feedback. Yeah. Super intrigued by the sleek UI, right? That's just it from this end, really impressive. I'm really grateful that you focus on the simple stuff and just made it very beautiful. And I'm a fan of Tailwind as well, so great choice using that. Thanks. A very interesting project.
00:31:56.374 - 00:32:58.254, Speaker B: Obviously very relevant these days. So I got a question for you right now as you're setting this all up. You're in the mode of basically you're sucking in all this data, but ideally you'd also be like the pusher out, right? I mean, eventually you want to be the decentralized distributor. How do you see that? How do you see this going forward? So I think what should be done is basically you have one thing that follows Archive and the preprint platform that exists today, and one that is community based. So you have like community based paper and official paper. So on the community based paper, you can vote and you have this Wikipedia like process to upvote a bit, like reddit. You can upvote, down, vote with different so all of this is quite a complex thing with game theory behind it and everything, but you could have this review process done by the community and you could have this community paper.
00:32:58.254 - 00:33:31.830, Speaker B: And then it's cool to have this platform where you can discover papers before they are even in preprint, which is nice, but I really think it should have the normal one, like official and community one labeled like this is a community paper. We don't know the quality. It might be something erroneous very cool project. Thank you. It's awesome. Thanks. Okay, bye.
00:33:33.050 - 00:33:38.410, Speaker A: When I'll be beginning our ten minute break, we'll be back very shortly.
00:33:40.030 - 00:33:41.450, Speaker B: Thank you, Katley.
00:43:52.120 - 00:44:12.010, Speaker A: Okay, so we'll now be resuming our session. Judges, when you are ready and also Ventura Protocol, when you are ready, please start sharing your screen. But I would like to confirm with both judges, see if they are ready to begin again. Okay, looks like it. You could go ahead.
00:44:12.940 - 00:44:51.056, Speaker F: Great. Yeah. I'm sorry if my sound of the video is a bit quiet. I recorded when my son was sleeping. So let's share that. Protocol a place to request and brainstorm for NFTs that don't actually exist yet. How it works is you have a person in mind who you'd like to ask for an NFT from them, just enter their name, look up a person on Twitter or Instagram, select the person, then we run a credit check powered by Covalent Protocol.
00:44:51.056 - 00:45:33.220, Speaker F: You can see that I have $50 and I have some wrapped ETH and die. This is the maximum amount I can pledge for an NFT. I don't actually lock up any money at this point. We wait for the creator to come back, verify their identity, upload their preview, and then everyone can actually lock up the money they'd like to pay for an NFT. So what I do is go continue and this is the place where I enter text the request. I would like to ask from a person enter token where this request will be based at. I'm going to enter zero one of ETH.
00:45:33.220 - 00:46:36.536, Speaker F: Here we have a reward table. This shows you that if the NFT sales later on an open auction for higher amount than you pledged, the person who pledged in various places here will get a reward. So if the sale is above 1000, for example, $1,000 in an auction, the person who pledged the highest will get $125. And this is for the higher amounts. So I can submit a transaction and actually everyone who pledged would get a part of the reward. After the final sale, the highest pledge will actually get an NFT if the NFT fails to sell in an open auction. So I submit a transaction now, prove it in MetaMask, and after it gets confirmed, it.
00:46:36.536 - 00:47:50.290, Speaker F: Should be shown in the list here's. Final stage looks. Users can go to each page, share it, and other users can add to the pledge, which creates that baseline price and gives them the rewards. So how is this implemented? So we have a front end application that has a credit check with Cavalant on the front end. There's additional credit check on each transaction via a chain link API Oracle to Covalent, because we check the 24 hours price ago for your credit so that we make sure that the user didn't just get a flash loan to cheat the system. Then from the DAP, we call filecoin through Web three storage to store immutable content of the actual request, the textual content as JSON. And then we have a subgraph of the events emitted from contract that we use to populate the front end.
00:47:50.290 - 00:47:55.570, Speaker F: That's about it. This is Ventura Protocol. Thank you.
00:47:57.700 - 00:48:02.130, Speaker A: All right, judges, you could go ahead with your feedback. Thank you very much.
00:48:04.900 - 00:48:33.784, Speaker B: Bena, do you want to go? Sure. All right. Very nice. Clearly, this is the NFT is the theme of the year, so it's cool to see still individual valuable variations on that theme. So that's fun by itself. I have a question for you. Do you have a way to curate requests? Because, I mean, requests could be just like all over the place, right? And then it gets very fragmented.
00:48:33.784 - 00:48:36.270, Speaker B: So how do you curate or funnel that?
00:48:36.960 - 00:49:15.850, Speaker F: Yeah, so the protocol itself will be kind of uncensored, but there will be a lot of bad content. I imagine people will submit because it's so cheap. On polygon, transaction costs are low, so people will spam it and things like that. So curation is difficult, but I guess we could sort by amount of pledges based on that idea, indicating that many people think that idea is cool. And we can sort by that and only show that content front end will be basically moderated, but the protocol shouldn't be because it's a protocol. So whoever builds their front end will have to moderate it in some way.
00:49:17.340 - 00:49:35.200, Speaker B: Cool. I like it. Thanks. I'll just say. Big ups on using the Covalent API. Right? And really proud of you for doing that. And you do know you could pass the data to the front end using the NFT's metadata endpoint? Yeah.
00:49:35.200 - 00:49:40.080, Speaker B: And then using a bunch of NFT endpoints.
00:49:40.740 - 00:50:21.344, Speaker F: I do know, but at this stage, NFT does not yet exist. So we could create an NFT for representing the non existent. It's just representing the idea, I guess. But so it's kind of that pre stage. It's inspired by previous project in Hackmani, which was irrevocable. And they have this idea of backing at the auction with some base price where if auction doesn't sell, the base price will be paid to the creator. But I would say about Covalent fantastic app API, especially the 24 hours balance we found really useful because actually, and also cross chain credit check.
00:50:21.344 - 00:50:51.450, Speaker F: So imagine you are on polygon and you want to pledge huge amount for an idea, but you want to use your balance from the main chain not to lock up, but just as a credit check to say you have the money to pay if the NFT is made. So Covalent just across all chains can just build up that credit check and be able to basically say, yeah, this is like a whale, or this person will be able to pay this, so the creator knows, oh, I can actually produce an NFT now because there's somebody interested.
00:50:52.380 - 00:50:57.196, Speaker B: Nice one, man. I mean, shameless plug. Big ups on using covillian. Good one.
00:50:57.378 - 00:50:58.300, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:50:58.450 - 00:50:59.150, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:05.730 - 00:51:17.460, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Ventura Protocol. We'll now be moving on to team Sdtd or STTT. Sorry about that.
00:51:18.150 - 00:51:35.100, Speaker B: Hello. We would like to present you our project, Trenton. Me and Brahma did it's about certification of Impact and retroactive funding. I will share a video on my screen.
00:51:46.430 - 00:52:46.142, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. My name is Trenton Gaddis and I am the founder of Digital Disinformation out of Singapore. So for this hackathon, what we focused on was certification of Impact. So businesses are typically well funded for things that have value, right? However, what's not so easy to fund are R and D efforts. And so what we're trying to do with the certification of Impact is to fund good work that's already been done and document this with an NFT using the Zora Framework minted on IPFS to open payment channels using Superfluid's ERC seven seven standard while integrated with Ceramics digital identity solution. Brahma will talk more about our demo.
00:52:46.276 - 00:53:46.340, Speaker B: Thanks. Hi. Welcome to Certificates of Impact. Certificates of Impact is about funding for research and R D after the fact, after the work has been completed. The idea here is to propagate goods that is being done by showcasing the good work done, by creating the NFTs for the good work done, and then maybe open an auction house or make it high quality such that we attract people, create a community and flourish the woolwork being done. So what we have done is we have already created some NFTs for this particular account as a representation of woolwork being done. And these are all the ones, I just loaded this particular one just four minutes back.
00:53:46.340 - 00:54:50.454, Speaker B: We are using Jorah IPPs Flick to load the NFTs into the system. We have not implemented the auction house yet, so we can add certifications if you want, and then we can select a file and then I can just mint that to create that NFT. Now, if somebody were to fund this particular project so we can go to retroactive funding now, I already have created a funding. So that's why you see the flow from the sender from this address to the Piper Nine address that I'm logged in. Right now, if I enter the address for the user that I'm logged in. So this is basically coming back. The certification is coming back that we just loaded now.
00:54:50.454 - 00:55:48.950, Speaker B: I go back to the retroactive funding again. This is the NFT just got loaded. So if I go to retroactive funding again, I will show the reward for which let's just suppose this funding gets done. We can also see the flow from Superfluid dashboard. As you can see here for this account, is showing one dollars per month as a token. Now also, we can show the user profile that we're using using ceramics that will show the person's did decentralized Identifier, any other profile information that we can maintain, we can update that information as well. So in nutshell, this is about creating NFTs for a good work done using Jorah IPFS Flick graph, and then maintaining the user profile, the good work done in the ceramics and being able to fund through super.
00:55:48.950 - 00:55:50.620, Speaker B: Chloe, thank you.
00:55:54.510 - 00:56:00.240, Speaker A: Thank you. So now we'll be moving on to any feedback from the judges and questions.
00:56:05.760 - 00:56:18.876, Speaker B: You can go. Right. All right, let's just go with it. Thanks. It was great presentation. Loved it. I got a question on decentralized identities and how you plan on using the ceramic.
00:56:18.876 - 00:56:57.144, Speaker B: Did to integrate it in your overall self sovereign identity framework or while you're looking for the unmute button? Yes. Sorry. How does it bubble up? How does it bubble up? I think trenton, are you there? It's all on you. This is his part, I think. Trenton. Yeah, he's on. Can you hear me? Yeah, now we hear you now.
00:56:57.342 - 00:57:33.220, Speaker C: Okay, so what we plan on doing is integrating a ceramics digital identity solution with defly platforms like Yearn Finance and BadgerDAO, because I think it's quite clear that KYC is definitely coming to DeFi. And so we plan on ultimately using providers such as Civic or perhaps another platform to do the KYC. So we're looking to provide a comprehensive solution for self sovereign identity.
00:57:33.960 - 00:57:52.910, Speaker B: Gotcha. Thank you. Really impressive work. I just took a brief time to look at your source code here, and I would say really great what you could accomplish given the limited period of time. Really impressive work. Thank you. Thank you.
00:58:01.760 - 00:58:10.910, Speaker A: All right, if the judges have no more further questions, we moving on to Team Filament Finance. If you're ready, please share your screen.
00:58:14.260 - 00:58:58.380, Speaker B: Hi, I'm going to try sharing my screen. In the third decade of the 21st century, the global financial system went to a category. Inflation had gone negative. People had to pay a bank to hold their savings. Money had gone digital. People began storing their cash in their own digital wallets and managing their investments themselves. This is how it works.
00:58:58.380 - 00:59:42.950, Speaker B: In the near future, employers will pay salaries. It's already happening. Companies and organizations are accepting crypto payments. How can you schedule a crypto? You set the payment date. Save it and don't worry about it. This is the problem we're trying to solve. One off and repetitive payments are normal in banking, cryptocurrencies, streaming payments, streaming, subscriptions, internet, utilities, insurance, loans and mortgages.
00:59:42.950 - 01:00:18.240, Speaker B: There's no reason to jump payments into multiple transactions. One transaction a year is sufficient. Unlike banking apps, crypto Wallets don't offer payment in the future. It's not possible to put an unexcuted payment on a blockchain. A contract do it, but it needs the tokens. It must be initiated a money stream with a variable range. It starts with a negative 18 decimal amount.
01:00:18.240 - 01:01:48.960, Speaker B: Then not necessarily using superfluid, a payment can stream to an NFT. It acts as an anchor of the stream, receives the money, opens up a lot of possibilities. It's just a token of the payment and sent to the recipient for the future payment. It's initially, the NST has custom metadata that defines start and end date times and the variable stream rate. It also has a visual image together with a metadata on IPFS. So I should explained that originally I had a teammate on this project who was going to be doing the technical stuff, but unfortunately he had to bail. So I continued solo and I'm just presenting thinking there's no code to look at.
01:01:48.960 - 01:02:14.746, Speaker B: Yeah, I did notice that when I took a look at the user story. It's pretty impressive given the proof of concept here and what you are trying to achieve with this. And I would say really kudos to that for making the effort and making it to the presentation at the end of it all. Thanks. Yeah, definitely. And very ambitious. So that's good.
01:02:14.746 - 01:03:18.960, Speaker B: I like ambitious. That drives things forward. How do you see the implementation happening though? Not just from a teammate perspective, but where do you see yourself sit in terms of a back end from a blockchain, for example? Well, we envisioned a future where banking is all done via cryptocurrency, and that means you would have a banking app which is basically a crypto wallet. And when we considered that, we ran into a number of issues, including KYC, and we also had this experience with NFTs. This is definitely the summer of NFTs. And we realized that we could reuse what we did during Hack Money and solve this problem of the future payments. But in terms of implementation, it's a lot of work that has yet to happen.
01:03:18.960 - 01:03:25.200, Speaker B: Great, thank you. Thanks. Yeah, thanks again. Great work.
01:03:33.920 - 01:03:45.910, Speaker A: Okay, so we'll be moving on to the next team. Just sit tight as I get the link from one of the team members to present.
01:04:24.250 - 01:04:27.000, Speaker B: Right, Juan. He's already here with us.
01:04:27.950 - 01:04:35.820, Speaker A: Yeah. Juan, are you there by any chance? I wasn't notified at all that we had to share your video, but we can always do that right here, right now.
01:04:37.310 - 01:04:55.490, Speaker B: Let me share the screen and I will play it. It was a little bit lower volume, but let's give it a try. Okay. Hi. Cool. Okay. Hello, my name is and this project is called DX Aggregator.
01:04:55.490 - 01:05:52.210, Speaker B: What I want to address well, I want to address market data prices. Usually market data prices are getting from centralized sources such as lumber and you need to pay for a data maintainer that gets the data and provides that to you. A possible headline for this issue is trying to get this into a decentralized ecosystem. Store that into IPFS or some service where you can get that more easily. What I did will well, I created a composable press aggregator using Fluence and Ceramic. So it's a service that gets the data, reads data from the market process. It creating market databars and stores that into ceramics.
01:05:52.210 - 01:07:02.422, Speaker B: Let me show you a little bit how this works. Well, here I had to paste this into screen. Here we have before running this test, I was not able to deploy it yet because some issues but I want to show you at least how this works. Here we have a bar, we have high is 3200. Here we have a test that we run which capture new price and push that into the processing service which is running in the Fluence network. After this we have a new value into Ceramic stream that has the new high and close, which are the future steps for this. Well, right now this service can be split into smaller services because it's a fat service that performs all the data processing.
01:07:02.422 - 01:07:32.360, Speaker B: Also I cannot add more data cleaning function. We do have a dependency on ceramic client because I need to install that into all the nodes that runs this. So that's another to simplify deployment and we can create a custom strip slide. Thank you very much. Was a pleasure. Bye bye. Perfect.
01:07:32.360 - 01:07:56.630, Speaker B: Sorry. Hi. Yeah, not seeing. Hello. Yeah, we are here. Yeah, I can share the video. I don't know why since the part of the screen didn't go out in the video.
01:07:58.540 - 01:08:06.580, Speaker A: That's okay. Thank you very much. If you have no further comments, we'll be moving on to the judges. Q, A and feedback.
01:08:06.740 - 01:08:46.340, Speaker B: Sure. All right, I'll go first. Nice. Very nice work. I got a question for you. When you said you can split things up into more streams on the price data, how would it actually work? Would you have one ceramic stream for each price feed or would you have one ceramic stream for all the price feeds and it's just within the document? That's a great question because honestly you would probably need one per instrument or an exchange probably. Because the more granular you have that you will probably be able to reuse it more efficiently.
01:08:46.340 - 01:09:09.836, Speaker B: The streams tends to generate a huge amount of data. So then you can rejoin them if you have them separate. So I would rather have one stream per instrument and exchange so I can then reuse that easily. Cool. Very cool. Thank you. Yeah, thank you.
01:09:09.836 - 01:09:21.104, Speaker B: Thank you for explaining that because I wanted to understand that as well. I'm really impressive project. I think we would have loved to see the demo too. As well. But it's fine, I guess. Yes.
01:09:21.142 - 01:09:22.770, Speaker F: Sorry for the terrible demo.
01:09:25.540 - 01:09:33.140, Speaker B: Let me know. Yeah, it's fine. I mean, the source code is there. I can always get to run it locally. So great work. Impressive work, man.
01:09:33.290 - 01:09:34.852, Speaker F: Okay. Thank you very much.
01:09:34.986 - 01:09:38.250, Speaker B: Thank you much more. Good work. Thanks.
01:09:43.170 - 01:09:52.960, Speaker A: Thank you very much. We'll now be moving on to Team NF trail. If you are ready, please present. Please share your screen.
01:09:53.830 - 01:10:31.100, Speaker B: Yes. Can you see has to be still be some kind of audio, please, because I can't hear your pain. You can't see the audio. Oh, sorry. I guess I have to reshare.
01:10:34.400 - 01:10:35.420, Speaker F: Classic.
01:10:37.120 - 01:10:40.130, Speaker B: Stall three time and yes. Okay.
01:10:42.740 - 01:11:40.320, Speaker F: Now your stuff on chain. When trading physical assets such as cars, real estate, or artwork on the secondary market, buyers often face different types of intransparencies and information asymmetries. Nftrail tries to fix this by creating an on chain document trail for these types of assets. This consists of minting an NFT for an asset using a unique asset ID. Verifying this asset ID using an external data source Oracle, and loading external data based on this asset ID. And then after Minting, letting the owner upload and attach documents to his token. This can then later be used by anyone to verify all different kinds of asset properties and can be used to support all kinds of transactions.
01:11:40.320 - 01:12:21.170, Speaker F: Generally, this applies to all different types of assets. But for now, we're going to focus on the vehicles use case. Vehicles are particularly good use case because the used car market is a real textbook case for information asymmetry and adverse selection. Also for vehicles, we have the Vehicle Identification Number Vin, which is a globally unique and standardized asset ID, which we can verify using public APIs and even decode to retrieve vehicle data. Now I will show a demo based on this use case.
01:12:29.200 - 01:12:57.168, Speaker B: If you open the application, you are able to register a new vehicle using the Vehicle Identification Number and a picture of your vehicle. This picture will be uploaded to IPFS, and then the CID will be connected to the token that you're about to mint. Then all you have to do is press Mint and you have minted a new asset token.
01:12:57.344 - 01:13:42.900, Speaker F: Once you have minted a vehicle token, it will appear on the left side of the screen, and you can click on it to view further details. Here you will see the Vin that you provided and a bunch of data that was loaded from an external API through an Oracle using this Vin. Furthermore, see the ownership history as well as number of attached documents. Down here you can attach a new document. For this, you have to add a new name and upload a file that you want to attach. Now it's uploaded to IBFS and with the attached document, we will attach the CID to the contract and thereby connect the document.
01:13:45.960 - 01:13:59.828, Speaker B: If you want to find a vehicle that you're not the owner of. You can do so using the search function. Now you will see the data for this vehicle, including documents that were uploaded by its owner.
01:13:59.924 - 01:14:35.510, Speaker F: NF trail is built on a combination of different technologies. We use web3 storage to store various data on IPFS chainlink to access an Oracle to verify the bin and decode it, polygon to host all of the smart contracts and the covalent API to query ownership history of the token. NFT is very much work in progress, so there are a variety of different improvements that will need to be done to regain leverage its potential. But I'm looking forward very much to continue working on it. Thank you very much.
01:14:38.680 - 01:14:44.650, Speaker A: Thank you so much. We'll now be moving on to judges feedback and any questions that they have for you.
01:14:46.140 - 01:15:28.636, Speaker B: Not a question here, but basically just to chair you, man, and say this is like really impressive. I can see the immediate use case, right, especially coming from a television country myself, where having trail on an asset such as a vehicle could prove very relevant for buyers here because you don't want to go purchase a stolen vehicle or vehicle problems and all of that. Impressive workman and super impressive that you've integrated equivalent API as well. Great work. Very much. Sorry. There's also, for example, there are even APIs that you could use this vehicle identification number also to retrieve like, information whether a vehicle was reported stolen.
01:15:28.636 - 01:15:54.992, Speaker B: I didn't put that feature in, but it's potential extension. Sorry. Yes, exactly. Very cool. I'm a big fan of digital twin implementations and it obviously has its place there. So I have one question for you. How do you plan on resolving the gap between the owner identity and the asset identity or the asset ownership? How do you prove that at the input stage? Yeah, that's one of the issues.
01:15:54.992 - 01:16:43.268, Speaker B: That's what I said with the dispute mechanism. So right now, obviously there's nothing stopping anyone from minting a token for your vehicle if they know the identification number and maybe have a picture of it. But yeah, potentially there could be like once you have a community around it, there could be some kind of dispute mechanism where you could dispute ownership and maybe provide documents or other ways of proving that you're actually the owner. And maybe that could be one way, I guess. Right. Registration or what is in Germany, KAF Setche and something like that. But then you still need to tie to eventually it always comes down to egov.
01:16:43.268 - 01:17:21.310, Speaker B: That's where I wanted to go because even if I have registration, I still need to align it with an identity. Right? Yeah. So obviously I think there are other upcoming so the identity of the owner in this system is just like represented by the owning address of the token. Of course there are upcoming solutions for identity and if you have some proof of humanity or something else connected to this address, then obviously it could be integrated. Very cool. Great. Thank you.
01:17:21.310 - 01:17:25.950, Speaker B: Great work, man. Awesome. Thanks.
01:17:26.960 - 01:17:41.100, Speaker A: Thank you so much. So that was actually our final team. Thank you, everybody, for participating in Hack FS. Thank you, judges, for your time, for your feedback and questions. And that is pretty much it. Thank you for coming.
01:17:41.250 - 01:17:47.440, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thanks. Thank you, Ben. Take care, guys. Be good meeting you. Bye.
