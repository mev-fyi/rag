00:00:00.410 - 00:00:32.760, Speaker A: That weren't recognized in the front end, thus restricting access to the backend. We'd like some further assistance with connecting the backend contract to the front end web app as well as some methods of transferring Ether into the smart contract. On a more personal note, I'd really like to thank marketMake for all the opportunities and resources they've given us over the past month. We're a group of extremely motivated individuals with a lot of time on your hands, and we'd really like to pursue this project even further. We believe DeFi is the future, and we want to be a part of it. Thank you.
00:00:38.000 - 00:00:39.164, Speaker B: Well, that was great.
00:00:39.282 - 00:00:39.950, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:00:41.620 - 00:00:44.610, Speaker B: We'll start for quick Q and A.
00:00:47.380 - 00:00:48.770, Speaker D: Awesome. Thanks.
00:00:50.340 - 00:01:13.030, Speaker B: Yeah. Awesome presentation, guys. It sounds like this is sort of like a Prisoner Dilemma game for employer employee relationships. And presumably the idea is you want to incentivize some outcome regardless of whether it's a positive or negative outcome, rather than having is it like you don't want the I guess what is the adverse case here that the employee just doesn't hear back?
00:01:13.880 - 00:01:46.580, Speaker D: Yeah. So the worst case scenario, if the employer basically puts in money and then the employee says that they've done their job after the time when the employer can actually call the refund. And if that happens, well, the employer wouldn't be able to get the money back, but the employee wouldn't really get the money either way. So the money will just be in the smart contract still and basically burnt.
00:01:47.400 - 00:01:55.780, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. You mentioned that you're interested in pursuing this further. What would you do as part of pursuing it further?
00:01:56.200 - 00:02:34.310, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. So the biggest trouble that I encountered when we were kind of building this out was connecting the back end contract to the front end. We needed to figure out a way to, after strapping in the MetaMask, being able to send Ether from the front end and then onto the smart contract, and then having that contract subsequently transfer Ether over to the other person's wallet. And so, considering that we are all kind of like blockchain beginners, I read a lot of documentation but was unable to find a way to do that technological piece. So would have really liked some continued assistance on that technical matter.
00:02:36.680 - 00:02:41.764, Speaker B: What are you kind of using as part of your are you using Ethers or web3 JS? Yeah.
00:02:41.802 - 00:02:47.396, Speaker D: Web three JS and we're using Ether as the method of transaction currency.
00:02:47.588 - 00:03:02.412, Speaker B: Right. Definitely check out Ethersjs. I feel like the documentation is a little bit easier for people who are still kind of getting their feet wet just because it's a little bit more expensive. Wow.
00:03:02.466 - 00:03:04.990, Speaker D: Thank you so much for that resource. Really appreciate it.
00:03:06.560 - 00:03:26.150, Speaker E: That was awesome, guys. I really love the enthusiasm here and the originality of the idea as well. I think it's quite cool and something that I haven't really seen done before in the space, so yeah, kudos on that. I don't really have too much feedback or questions. Sorry. I just wanted to give that feedback. Keep up the great work guys.
00:03:26.680 - 00:03:29.030, Speaker D: Really appreciate it, man. It means a lot to hear.
00:03:31.640 - 00:04:10.610, Speaker F: Probably echo the same sentiments. I think it's actually pretty interesting to consider what you guys are kind of building up in some extent. I'm kind of curious if you happen to have any other plans to build also features around, I guess communication channels in the platform that kind of make it easy for people to kind of get to chat with each other in case before the arbitration essentially happens. But yeah, it actually sounds pretty awesome in terms of what you guys managed to pull out so far.
00:04:11.140 - 00:04:43.310, Speaker D: Thank you so much for that thought. Originally we were actually talking about having a communications platform on the actual web app so then people can actually talk to each other regarding the first check in and making sure that both sides complete their end of the bargain to prevent any ether from getting burnt because we don't want that, right? So that's definitely coming in a future iteration of the project. For now, we were trying to bang out the MVP of the actual web app, but thank you so much for that suggestion. Really appreciate it.
00:04:46.480 - 00:04:48.190, Speaker F: You guys are pumped about this.
00:04:51.360 - 00:05:48.800, Speaker A: Just one more comment on that. We are actually planning on having a chat feature within the website, but the chat feature would kind of close once the contract is agreed upon. Because what we figured out in the game theory is that if you were to be like an employee scammer and you were trying to scam the employee, you could just message them like, oh, I'm just going to click cancel. You can click yes and you'll get your agreement fund back. Or you could click no and you'll lose everything. That canceling of any communication between them kind of makes it so that the only way for somebody to do that we called it like a fund hostage situation would be to explicitly write that in the contract. And then in that case, it would just be the fault of the employer not reading the contract or kind of not really editing the contract to their liking.
00:05:53.840 - 00:06:14.180, Speaker D: Yeah, but I just want to thank the panel of judges again and also thank Mark and make for giving us the time to do know like Arjun offered us. I would really appreciate the resources or maybe some pointers maybe for where we can continue to read more documentation and grow our blockchain ecoding skills.
00:06:15.640 - 00:06:38.076, Speaker B: Awesome. That puts us at time everyone. That was awesome presentation. Thank you guys. We're going to break now for ten minutes, so I'll ask the judges to you can make sure you're muted. Feel free to turn off your cameras. We'll return at 1023 Eastern time in ten minutes.
00:06:38.076 - 00:06:47.090, Speaker B: And the next team before everyone leaves is going to be Derry One. So if you could raise your hands and you'll be back in ten minutes. Thanks.
00:09:03.790 - 00:09:04.540, Speaker F: It.
00:13:46.470 - 00:16:31.010, Speaker B: It all right. We have returned. Wait until judges are good to go and turn on their cameras. Technically, we're not done yet with break, but start in about a minute. Right? We've been hopefully joined by a couple of the judges, maybe. All right. Okay, everyone is back.
00:16:31.010 - 00:16:49.172, Speaker B: The first team up is Derry one. Feel free to share your screen and begin. Hello.
00:16:49.306 - 00:17:24.560, Speaker G: We are team day one and we are building an onchain options aggregator. And the problem that we are trying to solve is that it's very difficult for both developers and traders to get the best options across the protocol. And the difference between protocols are pretty huge. For example, last year, at the end of last year, I found that the price difference between Hedge and Open was more than $50. And now we are going to demonstrate what we have built during this hackathon.
00:17:26.580 - 00:18:15.490, Speaker B: So this is the front end that connects to the smart contract. And as you can see, traders can immediately know what the ethereum price is right now as this is pulling the live data off Coin Gecko. And then this is the form that they can type whatever the shrek price range they want at the expiry date of the options and it'll return. It in this table below, whether it's Hegic or chart. So let's say they want it from 1 January to March 31 from let's say $2,000 and $10,000. The option size is five. And then once I click submit, they can see the premium, they can see the expiry date, they can see the option size and the price.
00:18:15.490 - 00:18:31.830, Speaker B: So Egypt says 10,000 charm has an option for 2200. And they can do that and they can just enter whatever input they want. The option table will return different price.
00:18:35.400 - 00:19:39.800, Speaker G: All right, so to explain our system more in detail, when a user calls our contract with some condition like strike price and expiration date, the contract fetches all the options available from Hedge and Churn protocol for now and it calculates the price for each and then return only matched options with the price to the front end. And all of this requires no gas. So people like traders and developers who call our contract do not have to worry about the gas price at all. And for our future plan, at first we are going to add more protocols. I know that there are at least more than ten protocols right now, so we keep adding them. And then at some point we will start add more assets like Wrap, BTC and Uni. And then also, since we support only call options right now, we would want to add other options type like put and cover calls.
00:19:39.800 - 00:19:54.160, Speaker G: And finally, I think the logical extension of our protocol is to expand to other derivatives like Futures. And yeah, we are pretty excited with what we are reading and thank you. So much for listening.
00:19:58.740 - 00:20:00.690, Speaker B: Awesome. Let's open up for questions.
00:20:04.500 - 00:20:29.448, Speaker E: I really like how original this is. I don't think I've seen something like this before within the ethereum space. And it makes sense. As you said, there's like ten or so kind of options protocols now, probably more. There seems to be a new one every day at this point. Having an aggregator for this is really important, I think. And the fact that there's no gas required to fetch this sort of stuff as well is really great, obviously from a Usability perspective as well.
00:20:29.614 - 00:20:30.056, Speaker C: I guess.
00:20:30.078 - 00:20:42.880, Speaker E: On that note, are you going to build in kind of functionality into your own app for people to execute on these things, to buy this option or whatever on your app? Or is it just meant to be like a soft kind of aggregator?
00:20:44.260 - 00:21:15.480, Speaker G: Yeah, so we want to focus on smart contract cloud mostly, but we are obviously creating the front end part of it as well. And I've talked to other developers in this industry and I know at least like two other developers who are interested in integrating that protocol to their front end. So we will have an official application, but we're also open to collaborate with other front end applications.
00:21:16.540 - 00:21:17.192, Speaker F: Awesome.
00:21:17.326 - 00:21:17.736, Speaker H: Well, yeah.
00:21:17.758 - 00:21:18.830, Speaker E: Great work, guys.
00:21:20.080 - 00:21:20.990, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:21:22.560 - 00:21:58.390, Speaker F: I guess in terms of that, just kind of curious about what your considerations are when you kind of start thinking about integrating with other, I guess, option protocols or potentially including more complicated, I guess, structured products, if one might call it that, as part of what this contract can accomplish. So how easy would it be for you to kind of tweak around the existing contract architecture to kind of support other forms of options and other forms of integrations as such was where I was coming from.
00:21:59.800 - 00:22:27.250, Speaker G: Yeah. We need to understand each options protocol in detail, like their mechanism, their interface, like how their contact box, their pricing problem and stuff like that. We also want to make sure that these protocols are legit. So it's very important for us to choose which protocol we are going to have next and understand each protocol deeply. Did I ask your question?
00:22:29.460 - 00:22:49.030, Speaker F: I think I get where you're coming from. Just kind of curious about what it might take on your front, on your side to actually integrate along those lines and how flexible is, I guess how important is it for you guys to be flexible in terms of the contract so as to support other forms of options?
00:22:51.960 - 00:22:52.710, Speaker B: Okay.
00:22:57.000 - 00:23:19.330, Speaker F: Interested to kind of dig a little deeper and see how you can kind of actually be. It might be easy enough for either you or for other teams to kind of start considering integrating this as part of what they offer up to users and actually see the CDC so distribution channels. All right.
00:23:20.500 - 00:23:34.230, Speaker B: One question that I had was are you aggregating just the actual option prices between these different protocols or also things like other fees that are baked into the protocols themselves.
00:23:36.540 - 00:23:57.150, Speaker G: The most important thing is a premium option price but we also need some other data like strike price, expiration date, asset type or football call, stuff like that. In the front end traders involved you can get all of these data.
00:23:58.800 - 00:24:19.300, Speaker B: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I was just going to say I like how you've done it because I was asking because I'm just comparing it to other aggregators like One Inch which are just like horrible interfaces because they're pulling so much data from on chain and I like the way that you guys have done it a lot cleaner.
00:24:20.360 - 00:24:21.350, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:24:26.140 - 00:24:30.936, Speaker B: Cool, that puts us at about time. Thanks guys.
00:24:31.118 - 00:24:33.050, Speaker G: All right, thank you everyone.
00:24:35.340 - 00:24:41.150, Speaker B: The next team is Avg market. Feel free to share your screen.
00:24:55.860 - 00:26:35.720, Speaker I: The project avg market so in description the user acquires an NFT coupon with a unique ticket number by purchase ticket a random ticket is drawn at a fixed time interval and eliminates the number from the pool. If the ticket number is the same as loading number the user can get the coupon and users can swap coupon today with ave frost run easily. This is demo. First of all you can create this distribution coupon so set the coupon token name and set a coupon token token symbol. Also you can set NFT token images which is the deploying to IPFS. Also you can set the ticket price as a number and also set the distribution interval is based on the menus and duration for buy and token for buy then submit first of all the images is deployed to IPFS then you can approve the contracts and just processing the contracts right now. So coupons just fully created.
00:26:35.720 - 00:28:35.590, Speaker I: So in landing page you can see the newly distributed coupons so you can view on the new coupon you can buy the ticket of the coupon. So once you click the submit first will approve the contracts for buying ticket. Once approving is done you can make the process for the contract after done. Yeah so you successfully bought ticket then you can see the different state of the ticket. So you have one ticket right now. So when the distribution is complete you can see the resource of the occupancy status. So if you win number is just rotary numbers so if the rotary number is matched with your ticket numbers it shows is win is yes so you can get rotary number so you can to cram the coupon just click the coupon approving then make the contract process so you successfully can your coupon.
00:28:35.590 - 00:28:52.610, Speaker I: This is the finished state so you can see on the MetaMask on your account you can get the NFT token.
00:28:59.940 - 00:29:36.172, Speaker B: Great, thank you. Let's open it up to questions. I think we may have lost Victor. Yeah, let's see if he will give him a minute to join. He may have dropped off standby. Oh is that will yeah, sorry about that. Feel free.
00:29:36.172 - 00:29:47.660, Speaker B: Q a to begin. Any questions from the judges?
00:29:50.320 - 00:30:05.030, Speaker E: There was mention of the, I guess swapping the coupon to die with an Ave Flash loan. I don't think I saw that in the demo. Or is that something that you have built that's part of the demo or is that something you have to build still?
00:30:09.640 - 00:31:07.000, Speaker I: It's the first time to upgrade the DeFi solution to the DApps. So I try to upgrading the fresh run with Ave. So that is my idea. So first of all, I should want it to follow the fresh normal process like swap deposit borrow, payback process. So at first loans as many die as the value of the coupon, then swap another coupon which is less current value with that die maybe from decks like Uniswap or one inch. Then after selling to existing coupon, then we pay the amount to Dai to Ave. But I already implemented smart contract, but actually there's some blockers while connecting to the Ave for restaurants contracts because there's no enough time.
00:31:07.000 - 00:31:11.370, Speaker I: So I just present the demo what I did.
00:31:12.940 - 00:31:18.650, Speaker E: Yeah, that's okay. Totally understand. I thought it was just like a cool idea as well. So yeah, all good.
00:31:19.760 - 00:31:20.750, Speaker I: Thank you.
00:31:28.960 - 00:31:52.820, Speaker F: Just get the sense that how easy was it to kind of stop using, I guess, the chain integration for you, I guess was there something that you kind of found was unusual or surprising once once you kind of use the VRF functionality?
00:31:56.440 - 00:31:59.520, Speaker I: Sorry, was the question okay?
00:31:59.690 - 00:32:15.550, Speaker F: Yeah, the question was just around the notion of how easy you kind of found it to actually start using, I guess, the chain link VRF to kind of integrate with what you kind of built up as part of the coupon system.
00:32:21.680 - 00:32:38.790, Speaker I: So to generate the random numbers, I just normally use with the channel link VRF, really easily combining both of them. But as I said, regarding Fresh run, it's already difficult and.
00:32:43.320 - 00:33:16.610, Speaker F: Yes, that makes sense. That's pretty cool. I think it's awesome though that we're kind of trying to construct something along these lines, so yeah. But would also kind of encourage you to kind of have a look at some part of the price group builders that put together is kind of plugging together. So I guess that might kind of make it easy for thinking of doing, I guess, custom interactions with NFDS in some sense and kind of use that as a plugin to build this out and see how that works. But yeah, it's awesome.
00:33:18.340 - 00:33:19.650, Speaker I: Okay, thank you.
00:33:20.900 - 00:33:27.250, Speaker B: Right, that puts us at time. Thank you very much. ABG mark. Appreciate it.
00:33:27.620 - 00:33:29.568, Speaker I: Yeah, thank you. Bye.
00:33:29.744 - 00:33:37.130, Speaker B: And the next team is Diary Prosperity. Feel free to share your screen.
00:33:44.450 - 00:35:15.922, Speaker C: I don't have anything to share because I wasn't really very successful in this hack. But basically my project was to build an app, decentralized app to issue NFTs that were personalized by the creator. And then these NFTs could be used to create signature tokens that could be distributed and these tokens would have a short lifespan so basically they would authenticate a person's identity to prove they're a real person, not a bot. And these signature tokens would melt away quickly vaporize after a short period of time so that user would have to reissue, get new ones. So that when essentially giving the person like a business a I messed this one up. So essentially the idea was to have a let's see if I can get back on track here to have the credit delegation.
00:35:15.986 - 00:35:17.480, Speaker B: Don't worry, take your time.
00:35:17.850 - 00:36:28.920, Speaker C: Being used as a means to capitalize and keep this thing funded. So the wallets that are credited delegated would create a funding a liquidation pool to essentially fund the whole project as well as give a high return back to the depositors. And essentially I had too many technical difficulties so I wasn't able to get very far with the actual coding. But most of what I was able to accomplish was just trying to understand the technology to verify or to back up my idea that it has some merit because essentially trying to prove people are real online is very difficult situation where I was trying to go with this.
00:36:29.370 - 00:36:31.640, Speaker B: What were some of the difficulties you ran into?
00:36:33.130 - 00:37:35.900, Speaker C: Well my difficulties were just trying to get the development environment going because I don't have up to date systems and I had already in the past had tried to get like node JS and stuff going and so my system was a mess so I didn't even want to mess with it. So I just went to AWS and set up a server and started trying to work that way. Everywhere I turned there was something else that had to figure out. I kind of got the Scaffold beast up and running and started working on it. We ran out of time. My main difficulty was just trying to figure out what kind of questions I could ask because I have so many different things to learn here. I was just mostly just going from all directions trying to pick up different pieces of information from all the different workshops, the resources everybody was making available.
00:37:37.150 - 00:37:45.200, Speaker B: I was using Scaffold ETH, I was using it. Did you run into any issues with that or was it specifically like.
00:37:47.490 - 00:38:39.200, Speaker C: Once I got it going it works pretty good. I had got it going, I got it going before, about a month before, so I kind of had some experience with getting it set up on my computer but then I was trying to do it remotely which made it more fun to try to figure out which. Austin Griffith helped me there, he figured out real quick I had a problem where it wasn't and so he just kind of said oh here it's right to doing it. Local host you're not doing it. Local Host you need to change your port, open your port, up. Oh yeah, I have a lot to do on this project, I'm not giving up.
00:38:43.110 - 00:39:03.474, Speaker B: Well that's awesome and it certainly sounds pretty interesting. So I'm trying to understand a little bit more. It sounds like what you're doing is issuing a temporary token and then that token gives you access to rewards in the form of tokens and staking returns.
00:39:03.602 - 00:40:11.120, Speaker C: Yeah, the idea is depositing it in a bank and that money on deposit is like the idea would be a stable coin deposit and then it would be credit delegated and then using all that money or funds basically lend it out to generate returns that can basically keep this whole thing afloat. Using basically every different protocol that I saw there. They all had different features in them that I could see as fitting in to make it all work and the governance because I see what I want occur is this thing to be decentralized and just running and essentially no company or nobody involved. Essentially once people's identities they're put into IPFF in an encrypted form so they can be drawn from when they're essentially their personalized token. The NFT would be like.
00:40:14.850 - 00:40:16.958, Speaker B: An access control mechanism basically.
00:40:17.044 - 00:41:13.620, Speaker C: Yeah, like kind of obed key or something like that. Or be some hook to it to make it interesting for people to want it. But then it would be used as like an authentication fee so that it could be used to create signature tokens and then those would be used essentially a person give it out to authenticate themselves and it would be trusted because they could see who they are and stuff. I have an idea for how the person is authenticated as a real person. Different ways of going about it, creating a pretty elaborate sort of method but basically trying to separate it so that it's secure. So no organization or person unravel it. So that basically every person can be one person in this environment and kind of give them back their individuality as people in a weird sort of way.
00:41:15.910 - 00:41:29.030, Speaker B: That's awesome. Yeah, that's awesome. That puts us at about time. But thanks for all the work and learning everything. That's the main goal of these events here. Keep on it.
00:41:29.100 - 00:41:33.800, Speaker C: Thank you. Presentation thing is a learning thing for me.
00:41:35.930 - 00:42:07.360, Speaker B: Yeah. Awesome. We're going to do now a switch here. The next team isn't here, but the earlier team, Bizarre Finance, who we had to skip over before so they'll be our last team. Bizarre Finance, if you can share your screen and remember to share audio and begin. Can you see us?
00:42:07.970 - 00:42:08.814, Speaker C: Yes.
00:42:09.012 - 00:42:09.482, Speaker F: Okay.
00:42:09.556 - 00:42:52.370, Speaker H: This is Bizarre Finance, a scalable, continuous financing for open source project via altruistic yield. We're solving the problem of misalignment between value capture and DeFi and open source dependencies. A project might create billions of dollars in value. However, the software that the project is dependent upon is only able to capture less than 1%. An average maintainer have an unpredictable income having to rely on grants. On the other hand, for the project themselves, they may be willing to fund open source, but they know that their treasury is finite. Although they may value having their dependencies maintained, most will struggle to justify the ROI.
00:42:52.370 - 00:43:28.646, Speaker H: We believe DeFi can fix this. We solve this problem by better capital allocation. We allocate a fixed portion of monthly interest, earning on your savings to a recipient and the rest to your account. Every month we split the interest into two tranches. One is a fixed amount allocation that goes to make open source revenue goal, and the excess amount is distributed to the depositors. A frictionless public good funding with positive yield. Let's say the depositor is SushiSwap and the recipient is hard hat under the hood.
00:43:28.646 - 00:44:26.670, Speaker H: A treasury may deposit dai through the hard hat vault. We then take the dai and deposit it to Agade, giving us a dai that stream interest. SushiSwap would then receive BDAI representing the principal and the both parties can start receiving interest maintainer receives predictable income while the DeFi protocol gets to make constant donation without spending, generate revenue from interest and giving the core team the peace of mind that the upstream software will continue to grow with them. There are other benefits to this construction. The smart contract that we do develop is completely trustless and autonomous. Their revenue earned can be rolled over through the next month and the deposits go into lowering with a barrier to entry for the next depositors. For the depositors they retain in 100% of the capital without a lockup period and as total value increases, the interest earned becomes competitive.
00:44:26.670 - 00:45:26.480, Speaker H: We have developed a working decentralized app deploy and integrated to Ave on Copen testnet. So here we can browse through the list of projects we'll select hard Hat. Here you can see your balance, your principal and down here you can see total value, locked income goal and the total amount raised. So we all deposit 2000 die. And just like that, your B token balance increases and started earning yield. For Hard Hat and ourselves. There are more avenues for us to go next, including ways to increase speedocain utility such as this ability for depositors to vote on features or GitHub issues.
00:45:26.480 - 00:45:28.898, Speaker H: As for depositors, there are ways to.
00:45:28.904 - 00:45:37.418, Speaker B: Reduce I'm going to have to interrupt for a second. We're only seeing one screen. I'm sorry, I didn't notice.
00:45:37.614 - 00:45:38.520, Speaker H: Come again?
00:45:40.010 - 00:45:48.930, Speaker B: We're not seeing the demo as it proceeds the opening slide bizarre Finance.
00:45:49.090 - 00:45:49.960, Speaker H: Oh, no.
00:45:50.830 - 00:45:55.050, Speaker B: Is there a video demo that plays?
00:45:55.710 - 00:46:02.278, Speaker H: Yeah, I think so. Could I share this on our zoom?
00:46:02.454 - 00:46:03.180, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:03.550 - 00:46:16.802, Speaker H: Okay. I think there could be something wrong with my desktop because the video is playing on my end.
00:46:16.856 - 00:46:43.980, Speaker B: Okay, hold on. Give me a second here. Standby. I'll see if I can share. Okay. All right, you can stand by.
00:46:45.070 - 00:46:46.460, Speaker H: Sorry about that, guys.
00:46:46.910 - 00:47:12.802, Speaker B: Sorry about that. All right, I'm about to share now. Sorry. Thanks for pointing it out, Andrew. I was like refreshing my screen over and over again, trying to figure out if it was on my end. Is it sharing now? It is not. Okay, stand by, guys.
00:47:12.802 - 00:47:29.220, Speaker B: I'm having my own technical problem here. Don't worry, it's always the last. All right, restarting. I will restart. I now have everything set. Sorry about this.
00:47:29.710 - 00:47:30.460, Speaker I: It.
00:47:40.030 - 00:47:45.226, Speaker H: Scalable, continuous financing. Now I will expand via altruistic yield.
00:47:45.418 - 00:47:47.920, Speaker E: We can just see your discord, not the video.
00:47:52.450 - 00:48:19.860, Speaker B: Try that again. Give this one more try, guys. Now let's try.
00:48:20.710 - 00:48:24.534, Speaker H: Let DeFi and open source dependency.
00:48:24.582 - 00:48:25.420, Speaker B: Is that good?
00:48:26.110 - 00:49:02.370, Speaker H: A project might create billions of dollars in value. However, the software that the project is dependent upon is only able to capture less than 1%. An average maintainer have an unpredictable income having to rely on grants. On the other hand, for the project themselves, they may be willing to fund open source, but they know that their treasury is finite. Although they may value having their dependencies maintained, most will struggle to justify the ROI. We believe DeFi can fix this. We solve this problem by better capital allocation.
00:49:02.370 - 00:49:40.480, Speaker H: We allocate a fixed portion of monthly interest earning on your savings to a recipient and stream the rest to your account. Every month we split the interest into two tranches. One is a fixed amount allocation that goes to make open source revenue goal and the excess amount is distributed to the depositors. A frictionless public good funding with positive yield. Let's say the depositor is SushiSwap and the recipient is Hard hat under the hood. A treasury may deposit Dai through the hard hat fault. We then take the Dai and deposit it to Agre, giving us a Dai that's trading interest.
00:49:40.480 - 00:50:38.290, Speaker H: SushiSwap would then receive B Dai representing the principal and the both parties can start receiving interest maintainer receives predictable income while the DeFi protocol gets to make constant donation without spending generate revenue from interest will continue to grow with them. There are other benefits to this construction. The smart contract that we do develop is completely trustless and autonomous. The revenue earned can be rolled over through the next month and the deposits go into lowering the barrier to entry for the next depositors. For the depositors, they retain 100% of the capital without a lockup period. And as total value increases, the interest earned becomes competitive. We have developed a working decentralized app deploy and integrated to Aave on Copen testnet.
00:50:38.290 - 00:51:18.680, Speaker H: So here we can browse through the list of projects we'll select. Hard Hat. Here you can see your balance, your principal. And down here you can see total value, locked income goal and the total amount raised. So we will deposit 2000 die. And just like that, your B token balance increases and started earning yield. For Hard Hat and ourselves.
00:51:18.680 - 00:52:04.520, Speaker H: There are more avenues for us to go next, including ways to increase B token utility. Such as this ability for depositors to vote on features. Or GitHub issues. As for depositors, there are ways to reduce overheads such as depositing into index of prospects like e two clients or whether retooling or a pool that acts as Gitcoin grants donation master. We did the math and with $50 million in total value locked, we will have enough to fund over 100 developers at a minimum base income of $50,000. Rethinking. Our solution unlocks the next level of open source contributions within the Ethereum ecosystem in such a way that truly scale alongside the application layer with full sustainability.
00:52:04.520 - 00:52:14.700, Speaker H: Bazaar Finance a scalable, continuous financing for open source projects via altruistic yield. You can visit us at thebazaar finance.
00:52:19.280 - 00:52:37.110, Speaker B: Awesome, guys. Thanks. Let's open for questions. This is fantastic. Like, holy crap. This is an excellent idea with excellent execution and it is extremely, extremely needed in this space. So well done.
00:52:37.110 - 00:53:35.510, Speaker B: I also really liked the possibility of having indices of different open source projects because I think that was actually going to be my first question before you mentioned that, because I think as a person running a company, I wouldn't want to have to go and do due diligence on a bunch of open source organizations. It would be nice to just blanket support all of them. I guess my secondary question would be I think people running protocols and protocol Treasuries are going to be significantly more risk averse than your average D 5D gen. And so I think one concern or one thing to think about is what is the potential risk associated with depositing into these protocols? And have you guys thought about insurance and cover against that?
00:53:37.000 - 00:54:07.490, Speaker H: Yeah, we did think about that, and for us, we also look at those groups of depositors as two different groups. So I think being like Treasury, I think they can absorb more risk. So one of the things we're looking at is ways to using Nexus Mutual or other insurance protocols and a way for people to select different yield interest bearing protocols that they have risk tolerance for. That's definitely something that we thought about.
00:54:08.420 - 00:54:20.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm certain that Treasuries would be willing to accept a lower interest if it included downside protection against any potential hacks and things like that. Yeah, absolutely.
00:54:24.520 - 00:54:53.600, Speaker E: Yeah, I thought it was really good as well. I'm pretty impressed by it. I'm a big fan of kind of like Gitcoin and funding open source projects and this makes a lot of sense, right? And I'm with you. There's a lot of money kind of floating around and not a lot of it goes to the underlying technology that actually supports all of this stuff so everyone else can make money. So yeah, I just wanted to know echo Arjun's thoughts here that I thought it was really cool, well executed project as well. I don't really have any questions, just wanted to give that feedback.
00:54:54.900 - 00:55:17.590, Speaker H: On that note, Anthony, is that we see that as open source, not getting funded as kind of like a risk as well to these protocols. Effectively, from perspective, risks that Arjun just brought up, it actually derisks them because if they are a patron, if they are a sponsor, then they make sure that these protocols that they are consuming continue to grow with the application that they're building.
00:55:18.440 - 00:55:39.790, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, that makes a lot of sense as well because even if we go as low as the ethereum base, like, I'm not sure if you've seen the core developers and how they're like there's not many core developers, right, that work on this stuff, and they're responsible for the whole network. And it's not just them, but all of these other kind of dependencies. So, yeah, definitely. Kind of feel that.
00:55:41.840 - 00:57:04.730, Speaker F: Just be interesting to even expand upon and just encourage you to think about what it might mean to include, I guess, the notion of utility that you touched upon for b tokens. Because that might essentially translate into might be very interesting to actually see that being used towards the creation of other forms of licensing schemes, especially for, I guess, the core developers work working on some of these public utilities as such. But yeah, I'm very curious to see what people would make of this in terms of having external feedback from the community and having that weigh in into the overall roadmap. But yeah, I think it's going to be a very interesting, I guess, way of introducing more forms of feedback in that context, especially around the utilization of the resources as they come. Because funding is an awesome thing that's always needed. I think it's going to be even more interesting to kind of get people to kind of weigh in with resources like feedback with the help of Ptoken. So yeah, it's going to be super interesting to see how that goes forward.
00:57:07.820 - 00:57:12.170, Speaker B: Are you guys planning on following up with this, like continuing to build this out?
00:57:12.780 - 00:57:21.436, Speaker H: Yeah, absolutely. Actually at the start of the hack we were planning to deploy to Mainnet, so we spent kind of like significant time on the smart contract side.
00:57:21.458 - 00:57:24.060, Speaker B: And now you didn't want to spend dollars to do that.
00:57:24.210 - 00:57:39.190, Speaker H: Yeah, exactly, that's exactly where we were. But yeah, we are looking to explore what it means to integrate with Gitcoin grants and I think getting plugged into this ecosystem, but also getting feedback from other applications. Absolutely.
00:57:39.720 - 00:57:40.710, Speaker B: That's awesome.
00:57:43.720 - 00:57:46.532, Speaker H: I just wanted to add do we still have some time?
00:57:46.666 - 00:57:47.824, Speaker B: Yeah, take it.
00:57:47.962 - 00:58:13.740, Speaker H: Yeah, I just wanted to add that I'm a part of several grants giving DAOs and we're currently looking into treasury management options and also the value that we're adding to our grants recipients as well. So as a treasury management solution, I think this is an added feature for Bizarre Finance, for Dows to just passively contribute to the projects that are supporting in the ecosystem.
00:58:15.620 - 00:59:05.790, Speaker B: Yeah, that's absolutely a really good idea. I know a bunch of Dows are just sitting on funds right now, not really sure where to deploy them, and it's really the main trade off that you have to get people aligned on is like, what is the risk of deploying this capital in this way versus just letting it lay there? And if you're able to sell people, I would almost even say that most organizations will not care about receiving interest themselves as long as the risk is low. All right, that puts you time. Awesome job. Thanks, guys. That's actually the last project we're going to do tonight or today, this afternoon, this morning, wherever we are, I want to thank the judges. You guys are awesome.
00:59:05.790 - 00:59:27.270, Speaker B: Thank all the teams. Judges, note you guys will get an email from Kartik about follow up and next steps and stuff like that. Um, thank you once again. We have a couple more judging sessions tomorrow and then closing ceremonies later this week. This I'd like to say goodbye to everyone. Thank you very much.
00:59:27.880 - 00:59:28.370, Speaker C: Thank you.
