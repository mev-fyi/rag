00:00:07.610 - 00:00:40.806, Speaker A: All right, let's get right into our next interview, which is with Jesse from Coinbase or Base. We're going to talk about all the things that have been happening in this world, and especially as we think about scalability, there's a lot more going on for all of you to know about and we're going to cover all those things. And without further ado, please welcome Jesse on stage. We got no good. That was my water, right? Welcome, Jesse. We'll get this on. There we go.
00:00:40.828 - 00:00:43.370, Speaker B: Hey, Kartek. How's it going? Friday.
00:00:43.790 - 00:01:03.620, Speaker A: It's Thursday. You actually almost have me. It's been a long week. Well, I want to start off by kind of just understanding some of the context around how did Base actually happen? What was the inside story here? How did you get Coinbase on board or who got who on board and how did this come to be?
00:01:04.150 - 00:01:22.594, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, happy Thursday. I'm Jesse. I have been in the Coinbase Orbit for six and a half years now. So I joined through an acquisition of a company I started and then I led all of our consumer facing businesses on the engineering side for four and a half years. So. Coinbase, coinbase. Pro coinbase.
00:01:22.594 - 00:01:53.482, Speaker B: Wallet. And then starting late 2021, I stepped into a new role. And the role was figure out how to bring Coinbase on chain. If you look at Coinbase's business, historically it's mostly off chain centralized exchange brokerage. But we started building new products like USDC, like CB Wallet. And there was a lot of appetite to say, okay, how do we transition everything over the next decade? And so that started what was a long journey to Base. A lot of trying and failing.
00:01:53.482 - 00:02:33.710, Speaker B: We spent about a year just trying products to see if those would be a catalyst to bring Coinbase on chain. We kind of got stuck at every point. A lot of the time we got stuck on, where do we put this and how do we make it actually work at Coinbase Scale? After a bunch of trying and failing there, they actually shut down my team. They were like, it's enough failing. Go find something else to do. And so that was kind of the late summer of last year. And then kind of out of the ashes of them shutting down the team, me and one of the other people were like, maybe we should just launch a testnet of a chain because that's been this thing that's just been like, blocking us again and again.
00:02:33.710 - 00:02:59.938, Speaker B: And so we launched that internally. People started using it and then we were like, maybe we should give this one more shot. So we made the pitch. People were begrudgingly, said, yes, go do that. And then we've kind of been off to the races. And I don't think anyone really thought it was going to be people didn't really know what to make of it until we launched the testnet. And then we launched the testnet and I think that kind of connected.
00:02:59.938 - 00:03:09.286, Speaker B: It was like, oh, this is kind of the platform for the future of the business. This is where we're going to bring the next million developers, next billion users on chain.
00:03:09.478 - 00:03:29.982, Speaker A: I don't think anybody knew that story. This is awesome. Well, that's a big mandate, so we're going to go into how you execute on that. But maybe before we get it started, what's the separation here between Coinbase and Base in terms of kind of how you think about what to do or what not to do?
00:03:30.036 - 00:03:42.130, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So Base is being incubated inside of Coinbase, similar to the way other chains have been incubated inside of Labs companies. Op. Labs incubating. Optimism off. Chain. Labs incubating.
00:03:42.130 - 00:04:14.442, Speaker B: Arbitrage One and Nova. So we're incubating based inside of Coinbase that operates as basically a startup inside of Coinbase. I'm kind of created leading it day to day, still really small scrappy team. So we're just heads down building. But we're given a ton of autonomy kind of to figure out what does it actually look like to build a decentralized network out of a centralized public company. That's the kind of like face of crypto for much of the world. And there's no prescribed path, there's no answer.
00:04:14.496 - 00:04:17.834, Speaker A: There can't be. They're going to be the one to figure out for others to copy.
00:04:17.962 - 00:04:50.294, Speaker B: We're figuring it out. So it's definitely a journey. But I feel super grateful to have, I think, having Brian Armstrong, our CEO, who's such a visionary, in 2016, he wrote this thing called the Coinbase Secret Master Plan, where he was like, there's going to be four phases. And the fourth phase is we're going to bring a billion users into the crypto economy to use millions of DApps. And I think that founder, CEO, energy, who gets it and gets crypto and.
00:04:50.332 - 00:04:52.074, Speaker A: Gets the wants it to happen and.
00:04:52.112 - 00:05:11.454, Speaker B: Wants it to happen. That's kind of what uniquely enables us to exist and uniquely has enabled us to experiment for two years to figure out what's the path. And I think now we're on a path that feels like it really can make it happen. And he's still just there supporting, believing, and helping us make it happen.
00:05:11.652 - 00:05:27.690, Speaker A: Amazing. So you've been experimenting for a lot of this on chain stuff for a couple of years. You tried it out with the testnet. What made you kind of pick the Op stack and what were things that you were considering in terms of kind of trade offs and sort of how did you land on Op stack?
00:05:27.790 - 00:06:28.140, Speaker B: Yeah, in the beginning of 2022, as we were kind of iterating through those products, we realized that we needed to decide how we were going to build kind of holistically for the business. There wasn't clarity of like, okay, do we build on EVM or Rust or Cosmos SDK app chains? So the first decision we made kind of in the first half of 2022 for all of Coinbase was EVM and Ethereum because that's where we saw the most organic activity happening internally, it's where we saw the most adoption externally TVL developers, et cetera. And at that point we kind of identified, okay, it's going to be EVM, it's going to be Ethereum, but it's got to be layer two too, because you can't do anything at Coinbase scale on layer one. It's just too expensive. And so that was first half of 2022. At that point, we started working on just scaling Ethereum period. We joined up with optimism on 4844 or protodank starting.
00:06:28.140 - 00:07:26.582, Speaker B: We've been now working on that, contributing core engineering resources with other Ethereum core contributors. And that's going to scale roll ups by five to ten x lower costs. And then we spent the second half of that year basically going out and talking to everyone and just trying to build a mental model for how is this architecture going to shape up? What's it actually going to look like two to three years from now, five years from now? And how do we want to fit into it? And I think as we went through that process, we kind of landed on a few things. One is that we convinced ourselves that whereas we kind of started thinking that there was going to be just one massive L. Two, we kind of ended thinking, oh no, actually there's going to be many of these things. And so what's going to be really important is having interoperability between them and having kind of an open standard that enables them to scale together in like a mesh. We now call that thing superchain.
00:07:26.582 - 00:07:46.026, Speaker B: But when we first started thinking about it was like the mesh of layer two. Is that going to scale layer one? And then I think on the technology side, I think just really impressed with the Op stack. We started working with the Bedrock version, which wasn't the one running on optimism.
00:07:46.058 - 00:07:47.346, Speaker A: It was like V zero and you.
00:07:47.368 - 00:08:24.798, Speaker B: Were really in the but I think we started getting in there and we, whoa. Like, this is not just an optimistic roll up, it's a foundation that can support an optimistic prover, but can also support a ZK prover, as we're seeing with some of the new developments that are happening just in the last few weeks. It's built in a really thoughtful way. There's really strong engineering team behind it and it's open source and it's fully free and MIT licensed. And that meant that we could just start experimenting. We just started experimenting and our lawyers were like, great, that's awesome, don't worry about it.
00:08:24.884 - 00:08:26.686, Speaker A: You don't hear that sentence often, right?
00:08:26.708 - 00:09:07.622, Speaker B: Exactly. It was rare. It was pretty cool. We literally launched a testnet, I think, in like a week internally on the Op stack, on Bedrock. And so it was kind of that combination of the technology plus the open source nature of it. And then as we started getting more serious the two other factors I think really played into it was when you think about Coinbase, we are obviously an important brand in crypto, but we're also centralized business, public company. And I think one of the things that was really appealing to us about the Opie stack was it gave us the opportunity to work with optimism collective who's kind of at the other end of the spectrum, they are pushing the limits of decentralization, of decentralized governance.
00:09:07.622 - 00:09:51.066, Speaker B: And it felt like bringing those two strengths together of the centralized public company and the decentralized leader of governance was just a really powerful combination in that there was really nice kind of strength weakness fit there. And then the other, I think, big contributing factor was we'd been working together for a year at that point on EIP 4844 scaling ethereum. And so it was just a context where it's like we knew that we were in this together. We loved the technology, it was open source. We felt like there was team fit and kind of strength, weakness fit and we knew everyone and it just clicked together and it's been awesome, really awesome.
00:09:51.248 - 00:09:54.010, Speaker A: And everybody can tell it's going well.
00:09:54.160 - 00:09:59.130, Speaker B: Super team is what we say. One super team, one super dream scale on the super chain.
00:09:59.550 - 00:10:29.018, Speaker A: We got to get the stickers out of this or a T shirt one of these days. Well, both of those are in a way, from an organizational standpoint, at opposite ends of that spectrum. You kind of have lots of people on the centralized side that kind of powers Coinbase to business and gets more people here. Optimism is pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a massive decentralized collective. How does base fit in here? How do you kind of think about decentralization here and kind of what does that mean to you from the context of the chain?
00:10:29.134 - 00:10:32.182, Speaker B: And you mean on the technology side, kind of like how are we technology.
00:10:32.316 - 00:10:35.494, Speaker A: Or even ethos, but primarily so.
00:10:35.612 - 00:11:27.266, Speaker B: And I actually talked a lot about this in my talk at ECC on Wednesday, but we believe that decentralization is absolutely critical for base because decentralization is the key characteristic that enables us to build an open global economy. Without decentralization, we don't get an open global on chain economy. And so no big global on chain economy then enables all the things that we care about. It enables stable currencies for everyone, enables equal access for everyone regardless of where you're born, enables stronger property rights. So that is why decentralization in terms of kind of like how are we pushing forward decentralization on the technology side, it's really about decentralizing. The Op stack, we're doing a bunch of things there. One of the recent kind of announcements is that we're teaming up with Paradigm on Opreth.
00:11:27.266 - 00:11:38.778, Speaker B: So we're going to be adding Op support for ref and helping us get to a second fault prover with Opref. So that's been a really cool collaboration that we're starting with Georgioson team.
00:11:38.944 - 00:11:41.370, Speaker A: You just talked about that 30 minutes ago. Even better.
00:11:41.520 - 00:12:22.758, Speaker B: Yeah, there we go. We're coordinated and then we've been doing a bunch of other things across the kind of like technology stack. We built this whole open source monitoring toolkit called Pessimism aptly named that's basically just meant to detect and respond to issues or anomalies in any Op stack chain. So Base or Op mainnet or Zora network, or Public Goods network or any of the other ones that are coming. And I think that felt like just a place where our strengths could shine. We have so much experience doing security and monitoring at Coinbase. This is a really great contribution for us to make and it's already kind of surpassed all of the other monitoring tools for Op Stack chains.
00:12:22.758 - 00:12:56.162, Speaker B: So that's another really cool one. And then another thing that we're working on right now with optimism is we're starting to design kind of the next generation Security Council that will do contract upgrades in a really secure way, reduce single points of failure, decentralize. That kind of process in a really substantive way and work across not just Base, but also Op mainnet and also other chains that want to opt into using this single Security Council. So that's really exciting. On the technology side, I might too understand that.
00:12:56.216 - 00:13:06.370, Speaker A: So I think you kind of, in a way, indirectly pointed out something interesting. So the seven engineers that are there, they're not just building things internally so that you can do this thing, they're actually contributing back to the Op stack.
00:13:06.450 - 00:13:09.822, Speaker B: Yeah, we joined as the second core developer of the Op Stack.
00:13:09.986 - 00:13:10.410, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:13:10.480 - 00:13:28.800, Speaker B: We're just building. That was kind of our commitment. It felt like if we were going to use the technology, we had to give back to the underlying public good infrastructure and make sure that it was sustainable and make sure that it could improve and decentralize and scale and bring our best. So that's what we're doing.
00:13:30.450 - 00:13:32.222, Speaker A: Well, thank you. This is great.
00:13:32.356 - 00:13:33.858, Speaker B: Yeah, we're excited about people get to.
00:13:33.864 - 00:13:39.170, Speaker A: Then use it and everybody is working and building and interacting with more safer.
00:13:40.870 - 00:14:10.380, Speaker B: Just right before we opened up base for mainnet for builders. So if you're a builder, you can go and deploy on base mainnet as of last Thursday, mainnet for everyone's coming in a couple of weeks. But before that, we went through a whole checklist of things we had to kind of check off before we felt comfortable launching. And one of them was a whole suite of audits. We did internal audits. We did external audits with kind of a whole code contest. And the really cool thing about that was those were like just extra.
00:14:12.110 - 00:14:12.922, Speaker A: Nice to have.
00:14:12.976 - 00:14:49.354, Speaker B: Yeah, they're nice to have. Like the Op Labs team had already run multiple dedicated audits, they'd already run multiple internal audits, they'd already run multiple code contests. And we were kind of coming in and saying okay, let's just get more eyes, more eyes. And I think other teams that are building on the Op stack are doing the same thing where it's like more eyes, more eyes. And in general, I think that's how we get to confidence in the layer two technology stack. It's like the more of us working on shared standards that are open source, that are publicly available, that are freely available, like Ethereum has kind of paved the way with their clients. I think the safer, more secure platform.
00:14:49.472 - 00:14:51.994, Speaker A: Testing, you can never do too much of it.
00:14:52.032 - 00:14:52.620, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:14:54.270 - 00:15:23.598, Speaker A: So one of the super interesting things that when I took away when the announcement came out of Base as a project was Coinbase effectively has 100 million plus users. And one thing we haven't seen really well in the spaces yet, we haven't seen distributions from people who are starting crypto projects, protocols first and then trying to go to users. You have the opposite problem, or the direction is opposite a problem yet. What's kind of the plan to introduce the 100 million people to Base and kind of how do you see that rollout?
00:15:23.694 - 00:16:07.698, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think this is the big opportunity that we have. It's like, how do we connect up the bottom of the stack to the top of the stack and make it work really well? And how do we make it incredibly easy, both for developers to build applications on chain, but then also for users to use them. And obviously, Base is an open ecosystem. It's decentralizing. We're working with all sorts of wallets, rainbow and MetaMask and Trust and Coinbase wallet, and Coinbase and Frame and a bunch of others. But I do think there's something really powerful about getting to just sit next to people, building wallets and build the chain with them.
00:16:07.698 - 00:16:56.500, Speaker B: And so a recent example of this is as we're working on Mainnet and we're working on a bunch of kind of like what comes directly after Mainnet? How do we get people on chain? I see some people in the audience here who've been collaborating with us on that. One of the things we saw is like, okay, if you're an everyday person, you're walking down the street and you see kind of like a wild posting or like a wheat paste, those cool signs in New York, and there's a QR code and it says like, okay, something cool. You scan it and you want to do that thing. We were working through those flows and when you scanned it in Coinbase wallet and you tried to do the thing, there was twelve steps before you did the thing. You had to back up your seed, you had to set a password, you had to set a username thing. You had to accept face. ID.
00:16:56.500 - 00:17:38.586, Speaker B: And so just in the last month we made it. So instead of having twelve steps, there's zero steps. Now you just scan the thing, the app opens and face IDs you and you have a wallet configured and then over time in the background, we'll get you to set up a Pin. We'll get you to back it up if you need to, if you overcome a certain balance. So I think that kind of product work where it's just like, how do we go from as a user, I want to do a thing? I have 12, 20, 50 steps that are confusing, that take minutes, hours to I am a user, I want to do a thing. And that thing just works. I don't have to make a complex chain decision.
00:17:38.586 - 00:17:41.550, Speaker B: I think that's my primary focus right now.
00:17:41.620 - 00:17:55.380, Speaker A: And not to mention stuff around bridging assets if you're on different chains for a lot of these things. Okay, that's really good to hear. You already said the developer mainnet access kind of went out two weeks ago. Main net. Very soon.
00:17:56.150 - 00:17:56.994, Speaker B: Very soon.
00:17:57.112 - 00:17:58.354, Speaker A: What are you worried about?
00:17:58.472 - 00:18:27.278, Speaker B: What am I worried about? I think it's always a little scary. I mean, always a little scary. I don't know. This is the first time I've ever launched a network. I have no idea from your real name. The way I feel is kind of like the day before the hours before you're throwing a party or like a conference or anything where it's like you have all the RSVPs. We know the people are coming, but are they really going to come? That's what keeps me up at night.
00:18:27.278 - 00:19:07.274, Speaker B: It's like all of the final, just like crossing the T's dotting the I's, making sure that we're doing everything we can to make the day one experience and the week one experience and the month one experience. Really great for folks, and we're going to try our best. We got a lot of fun things cooking. But the thing that I also kind of tell myself when I'm lying awake in bed is it's not about the first week, it's not about the first month. This is going to be a year's journey. And this summer on chain summer is the beginning of that journey. And it's a moment where I think we're going to start turning the tide and start growing the pie in a really material way.
00:19:07.274 - 00:19:41.670, Speaker B: But ultimately it's going to be years of hard work from the base team, from the coinbase team, from all the people in this audience to bring a million developers and a billion users and then 8 billion users on chain. I think it'll be done by the end of the decade. And I'm an optimist. I loved Eli. When you asked him, I was like, what would I say to that question? And literally verbatim, I would have said the same thing first thing. It's like I'm pretty right on the things that are going to happen, but I'm usually way too optimistic about the timeline on which they're going to happen.
00:19:41.740 - 00:19:52.262, Speaker A: So maybe let's force some measurable predictions two years from now. What does that look like for base or the overall L two ecosystem, from your perspective?
00:19:52.406 - 00:20:33.800, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that two years from now. So two years from now is, like, middle of 2025. I think that we'll be past 100 million people who are on chain, and I think we'll be working our way towards a billion people who are on chain. I think one of the things that makes that feel a little more aggressive than I think it actually might be is that kind of our industry is we're a little bit traumatized by a decade of kind of flat growth. Right. We've had, like, flat usage of crypto with some spikes because of price. But if you look at traditional kind of consumer product adoption curves, that's not really how it works.
00:20:35.210 - 00:20:37.014, Speaker A: Month over month, consistent week over week.
00:20:37.052 - 00:20:44.826, Speaker B: Month over month growth. Right. Like, that's how TikTok went from a small thing to billions of people. That's how OpenAI and chat GBT went.
00:20:44.848 - 00:20:46.666, Speaker A: From Coinbase got 100 million users, how.
00:20:46.688 - 00:20:49.706, Speaker B: Coinbase got kind of those are more.
00:20:49.728 - 00:20:51.280, Speaker A: Correlated with the spikes. I see.
00:20:51.650 - 00:21:32.550, Speaker B: But I think that at a certain point, it's going to change. Right. And on chain. And the platform that exists here is going to start doing consistent week over week, month over month, ten to 20% growth. And it will not stop until literally the entire world is on chain. And I think that that moment has probably started, like, literally just in the last six months or the last three months. When I look at the way I'm transacting and interacting on chain, when I look at the applications that are starting to be released on chain, I feel like we've hit that inflection point, and now it's just going to be the growth phase.
00:21:32.550 - 00:22:02.402, Speaker B: And so maybe I'm off by six months. I'm not sure. But at some point, definitely before the next two years, we're going to stop being in this, like, when will it happen? Phase that we've been in for, whatever, 13 years, 14 years, and we will start being in the Woe. It's growing. And I was talking to someone. I was talking to someone on the Optimism team because we were running around conferences. I'm, like, in Paris trying to meet everyone, but then also trying to keep our main net launch on track.
00:22:02.402 - 00:22:48.634, Speaker B: It feel like my brain is literally melting. And what I said to her was, it's freaking crazy right now, but we're not even really growing. Right? Like, if you look at the rate, growth rate of retaining years, we're retaining, but it's flat real growth. Like, the three months, four months, six months of Coinbase from April 2017 to the end of 2017, we grew 100 x in six months. That is just, like, brain shattering. And so I think that at some point in the next two years, we're just going to hit that and it's going to not stop until we get to 8 billion people. And that might take a few years, but it's going to be, like, one of the craziest roller coasters.
00:22:48.634 - 00:22:50.606, Speaker B: I think all of us get to go on together.
00:22:50.788 - 00:22:52.990, Speaker A: That's a perfect note to end on. Thank you so much.
00:22:53.060 - 00:22:54.640, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, y'all, for having me.
00:22:55.370 - 00:23:07.640, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, well, this was the end of our first half of today, so please enjoy the next 1015 minutes of break, and then we'll start serving lunch downstairs. Thanks, everybody.
