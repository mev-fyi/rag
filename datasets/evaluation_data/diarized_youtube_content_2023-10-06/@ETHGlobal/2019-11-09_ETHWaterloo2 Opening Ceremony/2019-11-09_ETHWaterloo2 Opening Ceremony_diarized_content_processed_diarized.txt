00:13:04.960 - 00:14:12.196, Speaker A: Thank you. Hello, everybody. Can you hear me okay in the back? The audio is good. Awesome. Welcome, everybody, to ETH Waterloo.
00:14:12.228 - 00:14:12.616, Speaker B: Two.
00:14:12.718 - 00:15:01.770, Speaker A: Thank you for being here. I know a lot of people traveled a long way to be here. How many people were from the Ontario region or nearby in Canada? Raise hands. A lot of people. Okay, how many? Raise your hand if you came from somewhere where it is warmer than ten degrees Celsius right now, which in Fahrenheit is 50 degrees Fahrenheit? Okay, what about 20 degrees Celsius or 68 degrees Fahrenheit? Was it that temperature when you left home? Okay, we're thinning the ranks. How about higher than 30 degrees Celsius or 86 degrees Fahrenheit? Okay, there's just a couple now. How about 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit? Is anybody in that category? Please shout if I can't see you.
00:15:01.770 - 00:15:10.376, Speaker A: No? Okay, how about 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit?
00:15:10.568 - 00:15:11.310, Speaker B: Anybody?
00:15:12.000 - 00:15:20.850, Speaker A: All right, who thinks that they were in the hottest place before they came here? Raise your hand. Can anyone beat that? All right, can you come down to the stage, please?
00:15:22.820 - 00:15:23.970, Speaker C: I am just.
00:15:28.020 - 00:15:44.648, Speaker A: I'm just the warm up act, and I'm taking that really literally. So thank you for coming to this cold and barren place. We have for you a beautiful Canadian hat, a beautiful Canadian wraparound scarf thing.
00:15:44.734 - 00:15:45.770, Speaker D: Worth it.
00:15:46.940 - 00:15:50.164, Speaker A: And some mitts. Please stay warm this weekend.
00:15:50.212 - 00:15:50.744, Speaker E: Thank you for coming.
00:15:50.782 - 00:15:52.650, Speaker D: Thank you very much. It was worth.
00:15:56.460 - 00:16:20.980, Speaker A: If you are also cold this weekend, we bought a whole bunch of little mitts like these. They're going to be behind the help desk. So if you want some after this, just go to the help desk, the information desk, and ask for some myths, and we'll get you some. Please stay warm this weekend. So with that little bit done, I want to call up Liam and Kartik, the other two co founders of ETH Global, to come and actually introduce you to this weekend. So give them a big round of applause.
00:16:25.720 - 00:16:30.800, Speaker F: Hello. Hello. Yeah, thanks so much for the introduction, Josh. My name is Liam.
00:16:30.880 - 00:16:35.396, Speaker B: And I'm Kartek. We're one of the co founders, or we're the co founders of Ethg Global.
00:16:35.508 - 00:17:22.804, Speaker F: Welcome to ETH Waterloo. So we want to quickly, before going into the details of Waterloo, talk a little bit about ETH Global and give a little bit about the story of why we're here today and how we've gotten to this point. So if you're not familiar with what ETH Global is, or maybe heard a little bit, you might know that what we do is we onboard thousands of developers into the ethereum ecosystem. We're kind of like the developer relations arm of the overall ecosystem, trying to get more developers focused on ethereum. And the way we do this is we run events just like this one hackathons, where we have hundreds, sometimes thousands of hackers come together at a time and place all over the world. And for 36 hours, try and build a project that interests them in accordance with what's going on Ethereum at the time. So this has been our most successful year to date.
00:17:22.804 - 00:17:50.972, Speaker F: We've done, I think, six events over the course of the year and we've done this all over the world. So we started it in Denver where we had hundreds of hackers come out. We then took it to our first ever event in Europe this year in ETH Paris. This is Austin Griffith. I'm not sure if he's in the audience here, kind of presenting some of his work earlier. Cape Town, South Africa, where we engage with all kinds of hackers from a totally different perspective, totally different technologies in that area of the world. New York, where again, it's a lot more hustle and bustle.
00:17:50.972 - 00:18:36.060, Speaker F: So hundreds of hackers come out. And India, where remarkably, you'd be shocked. There's thousands and thousands of Ethereum developers banging at the doors, get into this hackathon. And Boston, just a month ago in Harvard and MIT, where it was a lot of students kind of getting in in the action. So this has been our year so far and this one in Waterloo today is actually very special to us because this marks the two year anniversary of the first event we've ever done of this sort, which was ETH Waterloo in 2017. How many of you guys were here in 2017? So if you're not sure what's with 2017, this was kind of a monumental moment for the Ethereum industry. And I think myself, obviously biased think that, but a lot of folks would say the same thing.
00:18:36.060 - 00:19:21.548, Speaker F: And it kind of started off in this very grassroots roots way and almost as a hack itself. A small number of people, all volunteers, all with full time jobs, decided that Ethereum is really interesting. What would it look like if we try to get hackers focused on developing for Ethereum instead of just talking about the price all the time? So what we did is said literally three months before this ETH Waterloo 2017 actually happened, said, let's see if we can get some people interested in a hackathon. So we messaged Vitalik and said, hey, would you be able to make it out to Waterloo later this year? We want to do a hackathon. And to our great satisfaction he said yes. And so immediately what we did is we just routed as many people as we can, got them excited and announced on Reddit that we're going to do this hackathon. And at this point we had nothing planned, we had no sense of the scale of it.
00:19:21.548 - 00:19:36.252, Speaker F: We just knew we were going to do some big hackathon and we'd see what happened and the response was like monumental. Kartik and I have been running hackathons for years and we saw in just a month, 2000 people from across the world excited to build an Ethereum.
00:19:36.396 - 00:19:37.888, Speaker B: We thought we'd get 50.
00:19:38.054 - 00:20:05.256, Speaker F: Yeah, we thought we'd get like 50 hackers interested in this thing. But this Was, like, clearly a global movement and this was pretty remarkable to us. And to keep it in context, this was around the time that we did the first ETH Waterloo. People had really kind of clued in that this thing's kind of interesting. And like I mentioned earlier, there weren't really any events where you could go just to build stuff. There were a couple of bitcoin conferences. Maybe there was DevCon ethereum, but it was always things a little bit focused around the price.
00:20:05.256 - 00:20:26.256, Speaker F: And so when I was looking back to make these slides, I noticed this slide from the original ETH Waterloo, which was rule number one of ETHWaterloo. No Price. Talk and crawler is no pitching your ICO. And this was extremely necessary at the time because as you can imagine from that graph, there were a lot of ICOs going around at this time. Go ahead.
00:20:26.358 - 00:20:30.448, Speaker B: If you look at the second line, it says, if anybody caught, you will be removed from the event.
00:20:30.614 - 00:20:49.752, Speaker F: Yeah. And unfortunately, we didn't have to do that. But it was a phenomenal time, I promise you. So this was like I said, this was kind of a big bang moment for the ethereum industry. And it's what spawned all the work that we've been doing that we'll talk a little bit about later for ETH Global. We saw lots of great successes come out of it. Like three I'd like to highlight right now.
00:20:49.752 - 00:21:34.852, Speaker F: Number one is Gitcoin, which, if familiar with this ecosystem, it helps projects put up bounties in the Internet for small tasks on GitHub, to get any developer in the world to work on something and get paid to do it. The founders met and they spawned the idea of get coined at ETH Waterloo in 2017. CryptoKitties. Who remembers CryptoKitties? CryptoKitties, like, launched at ETH Waterloo. They were literally handing out Pokemon cards with cats on them, basically at the event as their initial kind of way to get people excited. And the set protocol, which is kind of one of the main protocols for basketting up tokens, they created the first product the founders Met and they launched it at ETH Waterloo. So this is pretty amazing for like, what was three months ago, just like, maybe we can do a hackathon kind of idea.
00:21:34.852 - 00:22:20.244, Speaker F: So this is why ETH Waterloo kind of stands out in our mind as being one of the most exciting times in this industry and what spawned the initial idea of ETH Global, which is why we're so excited now to bring it all the way back for ETH Waterloo two, which is with all you fine people. So thanks so much. Now, I want to also highlight, I just told you a little bit about ETH Global and the mission behind it, but I want to talk a bit about, from your perspective, what is it like to be at these hackathons? What can you achieve. And I want to show that with one story that I think is really representative of the whole Ethos. So here are the Jane brothers. They went. ETH india 2017.
00:22:20.244 - 00:22:43.932, Speaker F: So before the one that we did this year, in 2018. Yeah, it's been two years, 2018 before the one we did this year. Here they are with some of the Maker team and they came as like beginners to ethereum. They knew a little bit about it. They wanted to build a hack and maybe they saw on the internet, hey, this cool hackathon I can go to. They showed up and they met some great people like these folks from Maker and they built a project, they called it Instadap. Pretty straightforward idea.
00:22:43.932 - 00:23:20.744, Speaker F: What if we could make it so that any token, whether it's dai or whatever you got, could be used to create a CDP? Let's build up all the contract infrastructure on top of that. So it's like one contract call and you open a CDP in Maker and don't worry if you don't know what a CDP is. Basically a very useful tool to make it easier to use this platform. They worked with some of the sponsors and some of the open source frameworks that were available to them and they ended up winning. They won a prize, they got access to a lot of mentors, they met a lot of great people there and they kept working on it. They kept working on it for months and months and months afterwards because it was successful. People were putting money into this thing and it was growing really well.
00:23:20.744 - 00:24:18.232, Speaker F: And actually, just a few weeks ago, they were at, I think over $34 million were put into their contract, which they wrote, obviously they iterated on after the hackathon, but that they wrote for Instadap. And then they just announced recently they've raised two and a half million dollars to keep growing this idea into a real business. And now they're hiring people, they're scaling the team and they're making this a real thing that can benefit users of this technology. So this really is like one of my favorite stories because it exactly highlights what we're trying to do here. Get people that are a little bit interested, but that have the talent all over the world and get them access to the best of the best in the industry such that they can take their idea and turn it into something real. And that's exactly what I want to try to tell everyone here today, is that what you should be doing is dreaming very big. You're literally in a room with the best of the best in this industry today and over the next couple of days, go around, meet people, make friends, think of the craziest thing you can build and don't be afraid to take risks.
00:24:18.232 - 00:24:22.220, Speaker F: So, yeah, with that, that's what I hope you can do this weekend.
00:24:30.180 - 00:24:55.060, Speaker B: It's been a phenomenal past two years for us. This is our 14th event. We've done all these events across the world and I just wanted to share some stats. This is our last event in 2019 and we've had over 10,000 hackers apply for our events. And we're just about to near 1000 projects coming out of ETH Global Hackathons. And so far we've hosted people from over 75 countries. This is absolutely amazing.
00:24:55.060 - 00:25:30.800, Speaker B: We never thought two years ago that we would kind of be able to scale this beyond just this room. We're at the same venue in November 2017 and we just wanted to build cool stuff. But being able to see that effect translate to other cities, other geographies, other people being interested and they're trying to iterate on top of what they're building has just kind of blown us away. And we're super happy that we're able to share that with you this weekend. Now what really makes these events great is sort of our philosophy. We structure them so that you can build whatever you want. These are not specifically events about solving a particular problem or focusing on a theme.
00:25:30.800 - 00:26:05.624, Speaker B: These are opportunities for you to kind of retain the creative freedom you have and solve whatever thing you find interesting. This is an opportunity for you to learn about this ecosystem, learn how to be a better developer for what you're working on. Get mentorship from a lot of the industry experts, amazing sponsors who are here. The tools you're going to use are built by people who are in this building. And that's an amazing opportunity. And overall, just grow to learn this ecosystem and actually help and give back. This is entirely about making this ecosystem better and more robust.
00:26:05.624 - 00:26:53.916, Speaker B: We want this to be an opportunity for you to, in a way, just reduce the feedback loop that basically is needed right now to anywhere from make a project better by fixing bugs or giving them direct feedback, to actually doing anything we can to make this platform more effective. And also just to kind of highlight, this is a hackathon, not a conference, so everything is focused around building and not just talking about things. And to kind of say that, again, this is about showing what you're doing this weekend, not about talking about it. So we encourage you to still present your hacks to the judges on Sunday, even if you don't get them working. This is very much about taking the first step and actually iterating on top of it instead of just kind of admitting defeat. So we have an amazing weekend planned for you. There's over 30 companies here this weekend supporting this.
00:26:53.916 - 00:27:46.350, Speaker B: They have amazing developers, amazing mentors, designers. Anyone who is willing to help you is here to help you. Throughout the weekend, there's over 28 workshops on various topics, anywhere from beginners to advanced. And there's 15 tech talks about what's going on in this ecosystem, anywhere from research to best practices to what these existing frameworks are doing from L2 to getting better at the tools you already have. And $100,000 of prizes are being offered by ETH Global, as well as the sponsors combined. And on top of that, we'll cover this in a bit more detail over the logistics, but we have mentors available on all these topics that you can possibly get help on, anywhere from DeFi to privacy, to gaming. And you're more than welcome to sort of find them and kind of talk to them and work with them throughout the weekend to make your project a great success.
00:27:46.350 - 00:28:11.160, Speaker B: So, kind of with that, what I wanted to do was I wanted to kind of give a special shout out to some of our sponsors. Without their support, these events would not be possible. These are entirely run by the support we get from the sponsors. And thanks to them, we're all here this weekend. So I want to thank, first of all, our Gold sponsors. This is Scale Labs Fortmatic, Thundercore, Cosmos and new Cipher. Please give them a big round of applause.
00:28:11.160 - 00:28:56.676, Speaker B: Next up, we have our silver sponsors. Consensus uma seller rivet DNA crawlcat maker offchain Labs chainlink and Brave. Please give them a big round of applause. And our bronze sponsors ave, Orchid, Enigma, Zero, X, Trust, Token, Degraph, Diffuse, Peppo, Moybit, Coinbase, Zabo, Taxa, Taurus, Gawling, Provable, ENS, Aztec, etc. Labs and Coda. Please give our bronze sponsor a big round of applause. And lastly, these are our seasoned partners who've kind of supported us throughout this year.
00:28:56.676 - 00:29:37.212, Speaker B: So I want to give them a special shout out. And these partners are Ethereum Foundation Scale Labs ENS Zero X Taurus Consensus thundercore UNICEF Off Chain Labs new Cipher matic Bounties Network and Provable thanks again for supporting us. So we have a couple of things planned for you. We have an amazing talk, an interview on the state of this ecosystem that's up and coming. But before that, I'd like to invite a couple of our sponsors on stage to kind of share a few thoughts. They'll tell you everything about who they are, what they're working on, and how they can help you this weekend. So with that, I'd like to call Sean up from Fortmatic on stage.
00:29:37.212 - 00:29:42.610, Speaker B: Please welcome Sean. Thanks, guys.
00:29:50.620 - 00:29:51.370, Speaker A: It.
00:29:54.940 - 00:29:56.010, Speaker E: Click that.
00:30:02.640 - 00:30:38.390, Speaker B: Good evening. There are over 6.5 billion users who can't use your DAP. They're just too overwhelming for everyday people. In a world of convenience, DAP users are forced to struggle with browser extensions, mobile wallets, understanding blockchains, and smart contracts. And worst of all, having to manage their own keys and end up losing them. Here at Fortmatic, we see much of the user experience problem is actually a key management problem.
00:30:38.390 - 00:31:24.500, Speaker B: The mainstream users are underserved. Institutions are covered, but it's too expensive and inaccessible for everyone else. Tech savvy users, the early adopters are covered, but it's too complicated and prone to human error. There are also many centralized solutions that risks user losing funds and privacy. Mass adoption will not happen when we only build and stay our own walled gardens and hope people will come. And instead, our mission should be bringing the best part of Web Three to the users of Web Two. Something that's accessible forgiving and most importantly, familiar to mainstream users.
00:31:24.500 - 00:32:12.950, Speaker B: And that's the core of what we do at Fortmatic. With the patent pending technique we call Delegated Key Management, we took the highly secure and popular hardware wallets using Web Three and brought them to the cloud, enabling users to recover their account if they lose them. I know what you're thinking. It is also a noncustodial Sock Two compliant architecture. Keys are generated locally on the client and encrypted directly. With these cloud hardware security modules, fordmatic will never be able to see the private key at any part of the flow. And to give users full control, they will also be able to export or import their keys at any time.
00:32:12.950 - 00:33:34.620, Speaker B: On top of key management, we are also bringing a familiar authentication experience to mainstream users. If you know Fordmatic before, we've spent over 2000 hours of user research, testing and complete redevelopment of this upgraded design with extensive white labeling so you can use formatic without diluting your brand and user experience. Users will also be able to log into your app through email or phone with multi factor enabled. And if they are new to crypto, they will be able to make a transaction just with their credit card. No KYC needed. For starters, we've assembled a world class team who've built products used by millions of developers spanning many industries, from DevTools, infrastructure, blockchain and finance to deliver Fortmatic into hands of developers and users worldwide. We've come a long way in nine months since our launch this February, and I would like to offer my deepest appreciation to all of our integration partners and the Ethereum community TokenSets, Xerion, Cent, Banker, Radar, DDEX, Openc and so many more.
00:33:34.620 - 00:34:20.364, Speaker B: We wouldn't be here without your patience, support and feedback. Therefore, for East Waterloo, we're offering developers who are integrating with Fortmatic a grand price of Cad2500 that's around 1.2K USD for the most user friendly, practical and original application. We'll also be hosting an API Prize workshop at 09:30 P.m. In room Butterin with some tips and inspiration that can be helpful for winning the prize. You can use Fortmatic right now simply by installing our NPM package and using our fully Web Three compatible provider. You can go to our website, Fortmatic.com
00:34:20.364 - 00:34:48.340, Speaker B: to get started with links to our Docs Discord channel. Feel free to reach out to us anytime. We'll be wearing these t shirts. And lastly, Fortmatic is also opening up our Delegated Key management solution for enterprise use cases such as Headless Solution. If you don't want to use the Fortmatic Widget, please visit our pricing page for more details. Thank you so much and happy hacking. Thanks, Sean.
00:34:48.340 - 00:34:55.160, Speaker B: Next up, next up, we have Ethan from cosmos. Please welcome Ethan on stage.
00:35:02.460 - 00:35:08.136, Speaker G: All right, check me out.
00:35:08.318 - 00:35:09.050, Speaker F: Cool.
00:35:09.580 - 00:35:26.204, Speaker G: So I'm Ethan. I'm representing Cosmos and the Interchain Foundation. That's the nonprofit that's been funding a lot of the development of Cosmos over the last couple of years. Basically, we're on a mission to create an Internet of blockchains. So there's a lot of blockchains out there. They don't really talk to each other. We expect there's going to be many more, and we need to facilitate them interoperating.
00:35:26.204 - 00:35:49.716, Speaker G: And so that's kind of what we're all about. We've been major contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem for a long time, and we're very invested in ethereum success and in kind of interconnecting ethereum related blockchains. I'm going to tell you a little bit about that quite quickly because I only have a couple of minutes, so I hope you can keep up. All right, so we started launching mainnets in 2019. We've seen a bunch of them come online using our technology stack. That includes the Cosmos hub. It includes loom, includes finance.
00:35:49.716 - 00:35:58.636, Speaker G: Maybe heard of Binance. They launched the Finance Deck, completely written, using the Cosmos stack. They did it themselves. And DLive, which is a live streaming app that PewDiePie is actually streaming on.
00:35:58.658 - 00:35:58.940, Speaker F: Right?
00:35:59.010 - 00:36:03.436, Speaker G: So all these companies, all these projects come around. They look at our technology stack and they adopt it.
00:36:03.458 - 00:36:03.692, Speaker A: Why?
00:36:03.746 - 00:36:33.724, Speaker G: Because we prioritize the sovereignty of the developers and their community. The fundamental thing we want to enable is the flexibility and sovereignty of developers and their community. So they look at the blockchain ecosystem, they say, what technology do I want to use? They want to maximize their freedom of choice and so on. That's why all of these different projects and many more have chosen this technology stack. How do we do that? We have something called the application blockchain interface. The ABCI, right? And this allows developers to build applications in any programming language they want. So you're not confined to a particular virtual machine or particular language.
00:36:33.724 - 00:36:58.000, Speaker G: You can use any of these languages and potentially more. Most applications built in the Cosmos Tenermint ecosystem are built in Go or in JavaScript, the inventors of smart contracts. They run a company called Agoric. They're building their secure JavaScript solution within Cosmos on top of Tenermint. So we have Go, JavaScript rust java C. Python haskell Elixir erlang and more. So you can build applications in any of these languages.
00:36:58.000 - 00:37:15.824, Speaker G: So we prioritize Go for many reasons. A very simple, lovely, mature language. Very easy to be productive in, very easy for people to learn. Google built it. Google deploys it at scale. You know, you can trust it. We built the Cosmos SDK, which is effectively a Ruby on Rails for blockchains with batteries included.
00:37:15.824 - 00:37:45.592, Speaker G: Makes it really easy to build blockchain applications with your own custom logic. Really what we're talking about are application specific blockchains, where you build your own blockchain for your own application, designed in such a way that it's able to interoperate with any other blockchains out there. Now, of course, you might say, but I want a virtual machine. I want smart contracts. No problem. We allow make it very easy, actually, for virtual machines to be built in exactly the same way. On top of ABCI at this point, there's five different virtual machines that have been integrated into tenermint that kind of interoperate with the Cosmos ecosystem.
00:37:45.592 - 00:37:46.744, Speaker G: That includes the EVM.
00:37:46.792 - 00:37:47.084, Speaker B: Of course.
00:37:47.122 - 00:38:21.930, Speaker G: We love ethereum. We call this product ethermint. Huge shout out to ChainSafe who's been developing this for us. Greg, what's up? So if you want to run EVM smart contracts, solidity smart contracts, exactly how you deploy them today, but you want on a faster proof of stake consensus engine, you can use Ethermint. We also support WASM Agoric Secure ECMAScript pact from the Kadena team and even more recently, move from Facebook's. Libra, this is a project called Know. So if you want to write smart contracts in this language and completely co op Facebook's technology and prove that the open source ecosystem will always be better than the corporatocracy ecosystem, you can help prove that.
00:38:22.860 - 00:38:23.512, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:23.646 - 00:38:36.264, Speaker G: Fuck Libra. Sorry. So we're all about modularity. We're all about modular blockchains. The Cosmos SDK is this hyper modular framework. Like I said, Ruby on rails. Batteries included, right? So we have this thing called Ethermint.
00:38:36.264 - 00:38:53.910, Speaker G: Comes with a bunch of modules for staking, governance, rewards and fees. And IBC, it's this inter blockchain communication protocol. But it also, of course, most importantly, supports the EVM. You can deploy contracts to it exactly like you would today. No changes. Fully supports Web Three. Talk to any of the, what, 20 ChainSafe people here today if you need any help.
00:38:53.910 - 00:39:27.656, Speaker G: Of course, the ultimate goal of Cosmos is to interoperate, to interconnect many different blockchains. We do this with a protocol called IBC. There's a prototype of that available today in the Cosmos SDK. So you can check that out if you want to have an example of, say, two different blockchains talking to each other, doing something interesting. So, ultimately, the grand question for you is, what will you build? There's been this massive growth in DeFi on Ethereum. A lot of things were written in Ethereum and in the EVM. The question now is, can we rebuild those things in other more mature languages and more mature ecosystems and enable them to run in their own blockchains and to interoperate between them? So we have an API prize.
00:39:27.656 - 00:39:39.300, Speaker G: We have Billy, who's talking at 09:00 in the Napoleon Room on IBC and building NFTs and sending NFTs back and forth between different blockchains. Definitely don't miss that. Thank you very much and good luck.
00:39:40.680 - 00:39:54.520, Speaker B: Thanks, Ethan. Definitely the most creative use of stage time I've seen in terms of density. Next up, I'd like to call Jerry from New Cipher to talk about new cipher.
00:39:58.780 - 00:40:01.640, Speaker E: Feel like I have to purposely slow down after Ethan.
00:40:03.580 - 00:40:04.116, Speaker A: Hi, guys.
00:40:04.158 - 00:40:34.928, Speaker E: I'm Derek from New Cipher. Just a bit about us. We're the privacy layer for decentralized applications. So I think you'll want to use us just a bit about us. Our vision is unconditional. Privacy is a human right, and we endeavor to build a cryptographic infrastructure for apps to assert that right without having to give up on your privacy for other reasons. Our blockchain tech specifically is our new cipher network.
00:40:34.928 - 00:41:12.370, Speaker E: It basically allows apps to manage private data and secrets management, dynamic access control for DApps. So we're here all to hack and create a new app, hopefully. And the question you have to ask yourself is, how do you manage this private data if your app requires it? And that's where we fit in. So I'm just going to go through your thought process a little bit. So if you wanted to create an app, you probably use PKE sure, public key encryption. But if you look a bit closer, there are some issues. There a the data has to be decrypted before you can share it.
00:41:12.370 - 00:42:06.908, Speaker E: You might want to ask yourself sort of where does that happen? Usually, if you want it to be safe, it has to happen on a client. Obviously that can't happen because it's a scalability problem. If you want to share with ten, 100 people and have to do this process over and over again, that's even worse when it comes to decentralized environment because your data is now stored on some random IPFS node in some weird dude's basement and you don't want them to be able to access your plain text data. So that's sort of where we come in. We use something called proxy re encryption. It's basically this magical PKE scalable PKE that allows this proxy entity to transform data from being encrypted under a particular public key into being encrypted under a different public key. And this occurs without any decryption of your data nor access to your private keys.
00:42:06.908 - 00:42:57.216, Speaker E: Yeah, I know magic, but it's true. And so what you can do is you, as an owner, you can encrypt some data, store it in some storage that you want, whether it's IPFS s three, you can delegate access to some receiver that's done through a re encryption key that only you, the data owner, can create, and then you can go away. And now the recipient can now access your data and get it re encrypted for them. And so that's sort of this end to end encrypted data sharing paradigm. And we've taken this scheme and decentralized it. So now instead of having one proxy, you can sort of split that across multiple proxies and have this quorum that's required for the data to be re encrypted. So now you sort of have solved this availability problem if a proxy goes down.
00:42:57.216 - 00:43:30.216, Speaker E: So you could do something like a three or five kind of thing where three proxies out of five, any three proxies out of five, are needed to get the data re encrypted and the data. Is only re encrypted for that recipient. And so that's our product. Our product is basically the new cipher network where my font's a little funny. Our network is basically this network of proxies that facilitate this re encryption for apps. It's accessible. We as a company, it's a public decentralized network.
00:43:30.216 - 00:44:23.340, Speaker E: We only control a portion of it. The general public can run nodes. It's extensible in that we can implement other cryptographic primitives other than proxy re encryption. And it's pretty intuitive because we wrote it with this continued character narrative that's using cryptography with Alice Bob and a couple other characters. And so you might be wondering how to use, you know, basically it's just this method where you can store data once and then selectively delegate access. So we've had some pretty cool hackathon projects like the Snowden Project, where this team decided to have encrypted posts on Facebook and then delegate access to their friends for their friends to actually see the post. There's also this whistleblower app that somebody created where you can selectively delegate access to this to data relevant to some investigation.
00:44:23.340 - 00:44:48.484, Speaker E: So some pretty cool stuff. We have a $2,500 USD bounty for best use case of new cipher. Please check us out. We have a workshop today, tonight at 930 in the Napoleon Room. So please come by. I'll go into more detail about our technology and how we fit. And here are some cool links for you to check out if you want to hack with us.
00:44:48.484 - 00:44:49.860, Speaker E: So happy hacking.
00:44:53.420 - 00:45:05.788, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Next up we have Jack from scale. Please welcome Jack on stage. Hello.
00:45:05.954 - 00:45:30.444, Speaker C: All right, good to be here. This is ethy. Ethy is not just a Snugly unicorn, which is the Ethereum mascot, but Ethy is a bounty. So we'll learn about her later. Okay. We actually were in the airport today, and we rescued her from an FAO Schwartz, so she's looking for a home. All right, so really good to be here.
00:45:30.444 - 00:46:00.232, Speaker C: I've been working in Silicon Valley for a very long time, and I have so many friends from Waterloo and colleagues, and it's awesome to be here. Pleasure. It's everything. It's been hyped to be so very happy to be here. So who here is familiar with Scale? Okay, a few people. So Scale makes it very easy to take your Ethereum smart contract and run it incredibly fast. In non hackathon environments, that means fast and in a gasless manner.
00:46:00.232 - 00:46:31.556, Speaker C: So low costs high throughput fast block times and really solves for a lot of the usability issues that come with trying to scale Ethereum. So that's what we do. We've been at this for a while. We're getting ready to launch the main net very soon. And with just two lines of code, you can deploy to scale and run subsecond block times. So we have two 1000 die winners and 6500 die winners. More importantly, we have Ethy.
00:46:31.556 - 00:47:16.228, Speaker C: Okay, so one of the grand prize winners will also be taking Ethy home. All right, so we have a workshop. Christine Perry will be presenting and showing you how to deploy to scale, showing you the process of deployment. We'll be doing that tonight at 1030 in the Napoleon Room. Tomorrow, we get a lot of questions about scale architecture. How is it how is scale different from a traditional side chain? How do you get elasticity into a blockchain environment? We're actually going to go into architecture, go into economics, and have not necessarily a hackathon oriented conversation, but more broader architecture base and also talk about how scale is built into the ethereum network. So I'll be doing that tomorrow, 01:00 in the Napoleon Room.
00:47:16.228 - 00:47:20.836, Speaker C: So we've had 31 submissions thus far at ETH.
00:47:20.868 - 00:47:21.800, Speaker A: Hackathons.
00:47:24.780 - 00:48:03.732, Speaker C: Across the board, too many different examples. So here's a few we're looking at right now. And how do you win? So, one, you can run a side chain, so incredibly easy to take your smart contract, put it over into the scale side chain. Two lines of code. You can also do interchange messaging, so you can have ETH, ERC, 20 Dai and other permutations of ETH run on the scale chain and make them go back and forth with your application. You can also do file storage. So scale makes it really easy to run storage in the side chain in the blockchain, and it's actually cost effective to do that.
00:48:03.732 - 00:48:32.652, Speaker C: I'll describe tomorrow. If you're interested, please come by the architecture session. Lastly, we launched this at ETH Boston. It was very cool to see people actually leverage this. But you can run TensorFlow models inside of a smart contract. So you can take a pre trained model, and then let's say you have an oracle that's bringing in a price input. You can actually do fraud detection, price prediction, and take these pre trained TensorFlow models, which there's many, many of these available that are already pre trained for.
00:48:32.652 - 00:49:08.648, Speaker C: You could use at a hackathon or even do image recognition. So we had somebody do image recognition to identify location at ETH Boston and use that as an input to the Escrow to determine whether or not it was a pass or fail. So come by, talk to us at the booth. Happy to get into that. And I'm not going to go into this now, but tomorrow we'll be talking about how we use randomness rotation and incentives to make these chains secure. And we'll also get into the architecture. Anybody interested in Docker and Kubernetes? Okay, I see some hands come by.
00:49:08.648 - 00:49:22.684, Speaker C: You're going to see how this lives in a blockchain environment, and we'll get into that tomorrow. So no more from me tonight. Just want to say thank you. We are honored to be here. We love these ETH events, and let's have some fun.
00:49:22.722 - 00:49:23.310, Speaker A: Okay?
00:49:27.620 - 00:49:34.560, Speaker B: Thanks, Jack. We love scale, too. Next up, we have Sam from Thundercore. Please welcome Sam on stage.
00:49:38.980 - 00:49:40.308, Speaker F: Thank you very much.
00:49:40.474 - 00:50:03.752, Speaker B: Hello there. So I'm Sam Harrison from Thundercore. Happy to be here and happy to be part of the ETH community. This is great. So really quickly about Thundercore, we are a fast blockchain. Right now we're at 1200 transactions per second, although we have some technology that's being baked right now in our lab that's been stress tested at 4000 transactions per second. So it's going pretty fast.
00:50:03.752 - 00:50:41.140, Speaker B: We're fully EVM compatible, which means that anything that you guys decide to build that you want to be using the ecosystem and everything, that is fantastic. And you can transmit it, bring it over to Thundercore really quickly with just change of couple of lines of code and of course, highly scalable and highly secure. But let's get interest. We want to talk about this sort of stuff, right? Great. That's great about thundercore. Let's talk about Bounties. So, first off, we're going to give out 250,000 Thunder tokens TT for the best user experience and usability that can support the Thundercord stablecoin TT USDT, which is the equivalent for Tether for the USDT.
00:50:41.140 - 00:51:03.992, Speaker B: The next one says we want to see the best game or the best infrastructure. We have two different prizes, 100,000 TT for both of them. So if you can build the best game, if you can build the best infrastructure project, bring it by, let's judge it. Let's give you 100,000. Then the virtual and design aspects, we're going to go for 65,000 for someone who comes up and has the most users that they got over the weekend.
00:51:04.056 - 00:51:04.332, Speaker A: Right?
00:51:04.386 - 00:51:26.964, Speaker B: This is basically building virality, getting more users into the system. And then also the super easy one, the most social engagement. So take a Tweet, take a picture, do a Tweet, do an Instagram, get the most shares, get the most likes, the thing that goes the most viral from here at ETH, waterloo too. And then finally, of course, just some really quick things on the best analytics and best user experience, 35,000 each. So we have a lot of different.
00:51:27.002 - 00:51:28.228, Speaker A: Things you can build and a lot.
00:51:28.234 - 00:51:53.768, Speaker B: Of different ways you can earn prizes. Now, of course, terms and conditions, they're not exclusive. Feel free to go for as many of these prizes as you want. Have them demo ready by the end of the weekend. So just be able to show what you finish, what you were able to accomplish, and then be able to talk a little bit about why you chose to build with Thundercore, aside from the fact that the Bounties are great. So that's me, that's us. Come visit us out there in the hallway.
00:51:53.768 - 00:52:06.480, Speaker B: And I'm looking forward to a great weekend. Thank you. And our last presentation is please welcome Ken from the Ethereum Foundation.
00:52:11.640 - 00:52:35.980, Speaker H: Hello, everybody. This is cool because I don't really have to shill Ethereum since that's what we're here for. But I will talk about some of this cool stuff that we're working on at Ethereum Foundation. So what I work on is the ecosystem support program? And what button do I press? Green one. All right. Green means go. What is the Ecosystem Support Program? That's a good question, guys.
00:52:35.980 - 00:53:09.364, Speaker H: I'll tell you more. So, the Ecosystem Support Program grew out in the evolution of what we had was the Ethereum Foundation Grants program. But what's different? That's crazy, right? Why do we change the name? What do we do? Well, the grants program, since 2008 has granted and committed over $30 million to over 100 projects. Over 100 different projects, too. So a lot of money has gone out to a lot of different teams, and a lot of them has come out of a hackathons. ETH global. One of them Gitcoin, another one of them shout out to all the people.
00:53:09.364 - 00:53:55.540, Speaker H: There's so much more. Yeah. I only have three minutes. I'm trying to speed this up, but at the same time, I don't really trying. What we really kind of wanted to own in on was how, for the Grants program, we prioritized addressing urgent needs, and it had a lot of side effects right, in terms of balancing what's most important for the ecosystem versus what's the most urgent need. And you had to really kind of balance the scales there. But the biggest thing that we kind of really wanted to hone in on was instead of asking the foundation, what should we be funding? We wanted to flip that around and say, okay, we want to know more of what challenges are you guys facing, right.
00:53:55.540 - 00:54:44.710, Speaker H: What are the needs that you guys have, and how do we, as the Ethereum Foundation, best leverage all of our resources in order to help support you and make you successful? So with Ecosystem Support Program, we wanted to expand on the idea of what support means. Right. It's not just funding. We want to be proactive instead of reactive. We wanted to leverage more than just our resources in terms of what we have available at the foundation, but also in terms of people. How do we make sure the experts are brought in on these conversations? How do we make sure that you guys have access to and channels of communication with the experts like this, right? And it's easy when you're at Hackathons because everyone's here. But in the decentralized world that we live in, how do you actually get in contact with, say, Kartik or Liam or Greg? This is hard.
00:54:44.710 - 00:55:41.850, Speaker H: So what we really wanted to kind of get at is we want to be there as, like, an open door, right? Open door policy. Come and talk to us and ask us if you have questions over who to talk to. Where do I go? Parts of the different levels of support that we provide, and these are just examples we're still kind of growing and understanding as we start to address more and more needs across the ecosystem. We have done recurring research, funding local grants across the globe, targeted coordination groups, right? Getting all the State Channel guys together, mentorship, technical feedback, security audits, introductions, literally anything that you can ask for, we will try to get for you. And so past the weekend, go to Ecosystems and support. That's the website. I'll be here all weekend, so come find me.
00:55:41.850 - 00:56:03.692, Speaker H: And this is less of an application and more of a conversation, right? Just kind of go to the website, reach out and let's talk. But what else is the Ethereum Foundation doing? Great question, guys. We just launched challenges. Ethereum.org Amazing. So many huge bounties. Check it out.
00:56:03.692 - 00:56:22.288, Speaker H: We have pseudo Ethereum.org launched today. It's an amazing, easy, beginner friendly ID for Ethereum.org. It is super cool. I played with it for 3 hours today and it's just badass. I don't even know how else to explain it. Check it out and hack on E two this weekend.
00:56:22.288 - 00:56:42.330, Speaker H: We have prizes bounties. We have huge stuff going for e two. We want to make sure that we make it accessible and we want to make sure that this big thing that we're talking about all the time, we want to make sure everyone understands it because it is really cool and something that we should all be kind of thinking about and focusing on. And that's it. Thank you all so much.
00:56:45.420 - 00:57:46.304, Speaker B: Thank you, Ken. I also have a quick announcement from the Bounties network that couldn't be here on stage. So if you go to Waterloo Bounties network, there are a lot of cool bounties you can do and kind of finish up small tests and earn some rewards. So check out Waterloo Bounties network. So, next up, we have an amazing Fireside chat with two people that I want to introduce in a second. It's been a long couple of years in the development and the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem from kind of 2017 when ETH Waterloo started, to where we are now, we've seen thousands of developers, hundreds of projects and millions of dollars being invested into making this infrastructure a lot more sturdy and stronger and better. And we wanted to see if we can sort of COVID some of the good and the bad that's come up and kind of resulted as part of that.
00:57:46.304 - 00:58:20.970, Speaker B: So I wanted to invite to stage Camila Russo, who is the journalist at The Defiant, and Vitalik Buterin, who is one of the co founders of Ethereum, to come on stage and basically chat about what we just said. Yeah, we will have an opportunity to take some questions after this and we'll come to you after that.
00:58:24.780 - 00:58:47.704, Speaker D: Great. Well, hi everyone. I just wanted to thank Ethgobal first for inviting me to have this conversation with Vitalik. This is an honor to be at ETH Waterloo. So, yeah, let's get started. So it's been two years since the first ETH Waterloo. At the time, Crypto was approaching the peak of a bubble, which later burst.
00:58:47.704 - 00:59:17.260, Speaker D: Ethereum had really a front row seat in this roller coaster and it's come a long way since then. First, everyone can hear me, right? Yeah. Okay. So going back to that time in 2017, it seemed like ICOs were probably the main use case for ethereum. Obviously regulators came and cracked down on that market. Are you disappointed that happened? Or maybe relieved?
00:59:17.680 - 01:00:41.850, Speaker A: I guess there is two ways to interpret that question. One is am I happy that the amount of attention on ICOs has decreased in general? And the other is am I happy with the way in which the regulatory crackdown proceeded? I'm definitely more positive on the first than the second. One negative consequence of, say, the way that the regulatory crackdown proceeded, for example, is that it gave people the idea that doing an ICO is not okay, but doing a private sale and launching a VC coin and getting a bunch of rich people in the ground floor and then doing some work for one and a half years and then launching a shitcoin and having retail investors buy the shitcoin at 100 X. Higher valuation is illegal. And so people do the second thing instead of the first and it's quite possibly even more exploitative. So this is one example of a thing I'm not happy about, but the fact that kind of ICOs in that particular format in general are much less of a focus now is definitely something that makes me super happy. Basically, I think first of all, it's like ICOs, the mechanism are even though they're theoretically for launching decentralized projects and they're accepting decentralized cryptocurrencies, they're really kind of out of touch with the spirit of what blockchains are about.
01:00:41.850 - 01:01:24.336, Speaker A: Blockchains are among other things, they're about decentralization and trust minimization. And an ICO basically says, hi, I am a centralized king. You should give me $100 million because you trust me and I will build this crypto project and I'll make it great. So it is like philosophically, it's not kind of aligned at all. And you might remember at the beginning of 2018 I released this post like introducing Daicos. This was this idea that instead of raising into directly into the creator's wallet, you would raise into a smart contract that would release the funds over time. And then more recently there was this post on e three search called Public Interest Projects.
01:01:24.336 - 01:02:10.032, Speaker A: And then there's RDAI, which as far as I can understand is basically the same thing that also does another spin on that. So kind of contribute money over time and use smart contracts instead of contributing money all at once. And I think trying to use the tools that the crypto space provides us to try to solve the real incentive problems within the crypto space is something that's kind of much more in line with where my own values are. And I'm definitely happy that there is more people kind of thinking about that and there is less people doing the hey guys, I'm a centralized king. Give me $100 million and trust me sort of thing. And I hope we continue not seeing much of the first and we see more of the second, right?
01:02:10.166 - 01:02:43.150, Speaker D: Yeah. So maybe the space can mature into realizing crowdfunding is not a bad thing on Ethereum. It just needs to be more aligned with kind of the ethos of the network. Great. And also, going back to that time, you were very vocal about how there wasn't much actual value being created to justify the super high valuations with east now below $200, bitcoin below 10,000 and the whole space at around 240,000,000,000. Do you think that's still the case?
01:02:45.120 - 01:03:40.320, Speaker A: I definitely think that the amount of concrete value produced by the space has really improved a lot over the last two years. Two years ago, I think people's expectations were definitely getting far ahead of the reality. And now, on the one hand, the hype is lower, but on the other hands, the reality is better. I think that's good on both fronts, and I think we've made a lot of progress. There's a lot of things that have been and are being built over those last two years. Like whether we talk about scalability improvements, user interface improvements and if progress toward proof of stake progress on all of these D five fronts progress on these other applications, then I think the space is considerably closer to creating a lot of real value now. And I'm looking forward to when it starts doing that on a much larger scale.
01:03:41.220 - 01:03:49.750, Speaker D: Would you go as far to say that maybe the space or just ETH specifically is undervalued at this point?
01:03:50.680 - 01:03:52.180, Speaker A: No comment.
01:03:54.360 - 01:04:36.930, Speaker D: Boo. Okay. All right. Okay, so obviously I'll argue that in the past two years much of this value has been created by DeFi decentralized finance or open finance. It's these group of financial services that are being created on top of Ethereum. And some people have argued that Ethereum would be successful even if it's just kind of a financial chain. What's your view on mean? Is DeFi maybe kind of the last wave of.
01:04:39.060 - 01:05:41.892, Speaker A: I mean, I definitely hope not because in terms of what I, as a person care about, I would definitely be sad if kind of finance was the end of it though. At the same time, Ethereum is an ecosystem and I'm supposed to be not the dictator. So if it doesn't perfectly reflect my values, then I'm not supposed to be allowed to complain. But there's definitely a lot of value that can come out of creating decentralized open financial systems and doing a kind of really good job of making not just payments, but also different financial tools like insurance, smart contracts and kind of this whole suite of things available to the entire world. And it definitely seems like Ethereum has been making a lot of headway there. And I also see why finance has been the kind of initial application that people focus on. It's both one that brings money in money in the short term.
01:05:41.892 - 01:06:46.284, Speaker A: And it's also one where finance is the one sector where existing centralized solutions are the most terrible. Sending emails from country to country is trivial, but sending money from country to country is still something that takes a significant amount of effort. Whereas if you just do it over a cryptocurrency and I give you an address over any of these messengers and then you send money and it's done and it's much simpler. I see the value behind the D Five wave and I'm happy to see a lot of people building all of these things. I'm obviously wants to kind of repeat my caveat about guys, remember that these smart contracts might have bugs and guys remember that half of these things are running with oracles that fall far short of my and probably your standards of what constitutes adequate decentralization. And we need to kind of work harder and keep improving. But assuming that gets solved over time, I definitely think it's great.
01:06:46.284 - 01:08:04.032, Speaker A: And going beyond finance, I definitely think there's a lot of things that other things that blockchains can do. Like, I view blockchains more generally as being this kind of economic substrate for mechanism design. And that includes lots of things. It includes incentives, it includes storing information, it includes keeping track of public keys like data that users have published, things like ENS, things like just using ethereum as an identity layer. I saw there are some recent projects doing the whole kind of sign in with ethereum thing. And that's actually something that I think is like it's not like super $50 million Glamorous. But the reason I'm interested in it is because, first of all, who here has been SIM swapped a bunch of people, right? A common kind of belief that people have in the back of their minds is that decentralized systems are generally useful in contexts that require censorship, resistance, or evading powerful governments and these things because centralized systems are generally more efficient and better for normal people's use cases.
01:08:04.032 - 01:09:03.012, Speaker A: But in reality, the whole cell phone SIM swapping thing and just generally identity is a great example of why that's not the case. So basically just any rando can go and just socially engineer one of these telephone companies and get them to just turn over control of your account. And anything that you and we have started over the last ten years have creeped into using cell phone numbers as this centralized identity system. And so if you capture someone's cell phone, then you capture their identity. You can capture pretty much any online accounts where they use their phone number as a backup and it's all very terrible. I just want to finish the case for decentralizing the thing, right? So another one of the things that I've been actively pushing for, I've said this at pretty much every conference is smart contract wallets. So things like social key recovery, multisigs, going beyond kind of one key being the thing that defines your ownership of assets.
01:09:03.012 - 01:09:42.950, Speaker A: And my theory is that these kinds of techniques have to exist in a decentralized cryptocurrency land because this is this kind of hostile trial by fire environment where there's huge incentives to steal people's money. There's huge losses if your money gets stolen, huge losses if your money gets lost. And so if we make solutions that are good enough for this environment, then we can also kind of export these solutions and make them useful just as accounts for logging into other things. And now we have kind of crypto based account management as a base layer, and you start building things on top of that. And now you've started kind of recreating more of the stack on a decentralized base. I've talked for enough.
01:09:44.200 - 01:09:54.680, Speaker D: So I guess do you think kind of the next wave of Ethereum innovation or applications will be kind of identity linked to privacy applications?
01:09:55.260 - 01:09:58.932, Speaker A: I don't think there will be one next dominating wave. I think it'll be many waves.
01:09:58.996 - 01:10:25.250, Speaker D: Right, okay. And then wanted to touch on something else. You mentioned at a conference, which is this question of whether ETH is money. You said ETH is money if the community wants it to be. So what's your opinion on that? Do you want ETH to be money? And if you do, how good do you think ETH is at being money?
01:10:27.060 - 01:11:04.076, Speaker A: So in Yudkowski and rationalist culture, which is my religion, there is this kind of thing that you're supposed to do, which is kind of taboo, in your words. Right. So when people have a disagreement about whether or not X is a Y, it seems intractable. Try to figure out your disagreement without using the word Y. Right. Because chances are a lot of the time what happens is that people don't actually disagree on substance. They just have different ideas on what this word is.
01:11:04.076 - 01:11:49.916, Speaker A: And money is this funny word that lots of people have different meanings for. So, like, okay, who here thinks that money and currency are synonyms? Who here thinks that money and currency are not synonyms? Okay, I saw hands raised for both, so we can't even agree on that. Right. So clearly the Is ETH money question me very well. Not even points to any kind of substantive disagreement. So what can ETH be used for and can ETH be used for as a way of holding value and sending that value between I mean, the Ethereum Foundation has even used ETH that way internally for years. Can ETH be used as a unit of value within smart contracts? Yes.
01:11:49.916 - 01:11:54.152, Speaker A: Can ETH be used as a way for paying of paying for transaction fees?
01:11:54.216 - 01:11:54.830, Speaker E: Yes.
01:11:55.440 - 01:12:08.484, Speaker A: Is ETH something that I recommend as a replacement for US. Dollars next year or even ten years from now? Probably no. So it depends on kind of what your objective is here.
01:12:08.602 - 01:12:34.004, Speaker D: Makes sense. Okay. And then going to another topic to developer experience. Two years ago, it was a lot harder to build something on Ethereum over a weekend like all of these people here are going to do in the next two days. How do you think developer experience compares this year with 2017?
01:12:34.132 - 01:13:34.300, Speaker A: I definitely think a lot of things have gotten better. First of all, just a lot of the different tools that people have been using have improved more and more over time on development environments. Even just the ability to access the blockchain and run a full node efficiently has gotten better. Documentation has gotten better, compilers have gotten better, things that you can integrate with Uniswap now exists and lots of applications plug into Uniswap ENS is substantially more mature. Formal verification infrastructure is another big one that's made significant strides zero knowledge proof infrastructure. So there's definitely a lot of infrastructure that exists now and a lot of things that have gotten easier now that were not there in 2017 and also just kind of knowledge inside people's heads in the community and I definitely think there's been a lot of progress.
01:13:34.720 - 01:13:38.480, Speaker D: So what do you think is missing? What are the big pieces?
01:13:38.980 - 01:14:53.540, Speaker A: What are the big pieces? So this is the sort of question that where my answers have been kind of the same for about five years. And we have been making a lot of progress though, right? So one is scalability transactions are too expensive and now the new cool thing is roll ups apparently and then of course the short term new cool thing and the medium term cool thing is Sharding and those have made huge progress. Another one is just like latency of transactions and this is just for user experience reasons. Like when I send a transaction it should be included on chain and get a confirmation within. Ideally Bitcoin was like ten minutes to an hour, then Ethereum got that down to a couple of minutes, but block time is 12 seconds. But because of fee markets weirdness, most of the time people set their fees low and they often have to wait longer and I'm hoping like EIP 1559 can fix that and get most transactions included in the next block proof of stake just kind of providing more consistent block times. Also with the way that LMD Ghost provides basically 100 confirmations in parallel.
01:14:53.540 - 01:15:39.830, Speaker A: So with E 2.0 we get more confirmations sooner that'll solve some more UX issues. Privacy ZK Snark based stuff needs to continue to get better. I think we just need more incremental improvements on things like proving time for example, so that signing a transaction or generating a zero knowledge proof can be just a little bit faster. Also better developer tools for privacy preserving anything security and kind of more user friendly form of verification infrastructure is always good. So all of those things put together, it's really kind of a bunch of these incremental slogs where if we make a lot of progress on each of them, I think we'll do a great. Job.
01:15:40.780 - 01:16:09.970, Speaker D: Okay. And then speaking of things missing, I think going back to ETH, Waterloo 2017, some people back then maybe would have expected that Serenity would have launched by now. What do you say to those critics who criticize Ethereum for not having launched E 2.0 yet, considering some Bitcoiners use that as an excuse to say it is a scam and so on?
01:16:11.780 - 01:17:02.944, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess first of all, yes, I definitely was over optimistic about the timing of East Two. At the same time, the thing I've said is that the properties that East Two has continue to get better and better. And every time we make an action that looks like, oh, we're going back to the drawing board, every time that happens, it looks less and less drawing boardy. So the most recent thing, the switch from 1024 shards with cross linking every epoch to 64 shards with cross linking every slot, substantial reorganization of how sharding works, but it doesn't really slow down development. It's a really substantial simplification. It enabled a bunch of things that we thought we would not be able to have before and we've continued to have all of these improvements of that type. And so the E 2.0
01:17:02.944 - 01:17:37.804, Speaker A: final product that it's looking like we'll see is definitely much better than the E 2.0 that I was saying four years ago we would have two years from then. There is the bad, but also the good in general. Proof of stake has testnets and we're going to get to much larger public testnets. We'll get to cross client testnets, we're going to get to launch of Phase Zero. And at some point, I think the critics are just going to have to kind of face reality and they're like, look guys, there is a proof of stake chain. It's running.
01:17:37.804 - 01:17:52.720, Speaker A: And the thing is not a scam. I think it'll definitely make me very happy to see that day. And who knows, maybe five years from now, even Bitcoin will be looking at proof of stake a little more favorably.
01:17:54.820 - 01:18:08.080, Speaker D: Yeah, no, that's an interesting point. I don't know if you want to expand more on that. It's a little bit off topic, but yeah, considering kind of Bitcoin switching to proof of stake, I think I don't know. It's an interesting notion.
01:18:08.240 - 01:18:58.484, Speaker A: Oh, yes. I love these. Okay, so yay. I go into joyful heretic mode. So I guess the challenge is, right, that there's this kind of looming elephant in the room over, I mean, a lot of different cryptocurrencies that kind of committed to a capped Issuance schedule, and they really committed to this idea that Issuance is evil and we must have a hard cap. And because a hard cap is the Austrian way and we must take a strong stance that we are not like those hyperinflationist fiat gold bugs. But the problem is that you need to pay miners for security.
01:18:58.484 - 01:19:42.928, Speaker A: And the story has always been, well, we'll use transaction fees for this right? But if you look at reality right so right now, I think in Bitcoin, for example, last time I checked it was about the daily block reward was about $7 million. The daily transaction fees are about 140,000. That's about a factor of 50 difference. In Ethereum, the block reward is about two ETH and the transaction fees are about somewhere between 0.3 and 0.2 E depending on which day it is and whether or not some Fairwin or some other crazy application is burning a million dollars in fees because of bad mechanics or whatever. But in general there seems to be this kind of about factor of 50 difference between Issuance and fees.
01:19:42.928 - 01:20:49.556, Speaker A: And it's not at all clear that fees are going to be able to kind of basically it's not at all clear that blockchains are going to continue to be secure when Issuance is 50 times lower or once the amount going to security providers or miners or stakers is 50 times or lower than it is now. And I do think that proof of stake does better than proof of work with lower security budgets. But even with proof of stake I'm not confident that Ethereum proof of stake with zero issuance is something that it is guaranteed to be able to survive, for example. Which is why even past proof of stake we're decreasing the issuance heavily. But there is still some issuance. One of the common replies to this, of course, is like oh, cryptocurrencies are obviously going to be 100 times bigger in ten years and that'll cancel things out. But number one, you're not allowed to make crazy super optimistic assumptions if you're going to argue about the security of a system that protects people's life savings.
01:20:49.556 - 01:21:47.420, Speaker A: And number two, that's not even a correct argument because if a system gets 50 times bigger then sure, the security budget becomes 50 times bigger but the size of the attackers who care about breaking it becomes 50 times bigger. So I think the relative actually matters more than the absolute. And that's an area where kind of the people that focus on the absolute being canceled out by growth of the ecosystem are just wrong. My view on I think proof of stake is important and it doesn't even have to be full proof of stake. It could even be hybrid. Proof of stake is a good way of just getting more security with kind of much lower rewards. And issuance, which I think is important especially for PEF people, kind of value these things like having low issuance or potentially even zero issuance and so forth.
01:21:47.420 - 01:23:20.872, Speaker A: But then also my own views on monetary policy. For example, this is the question where people ask why doesn't Ethereum do a hard cap or why doesn't like, commit to a specific schedule or something like this? And I remember there was a panel at Edcon on the opposite side of the world in Sydney six months ago where this was this kind of controversial issues panel at the conference, and I asked a bunch of Ethereum community members, do you guys support a hard cap? And the answer I got was universally no. And the reason why is basically because people seem to kind of appreciate a more kind of pragmatic approach, and one that basically says that instead of optimizing for predictability of Issuance, we're going to optimize for predictability of security because the platform surviving is the most important thing, and if the platform doesn't survive, we're all screwed anyway. So predictability of security is really important. And the problem is that we don't know the ratio of security to Issuance ahead of time. That's just a variable that the real world has, and we might learn things about it five or ten or 20 years from now. So if we have to choose between stabilizing Issuance and stabilizing security and we want to stabilize security, that does mean that there's going to be kind of less certainty on Issuance than some people would like.
01:23:20.872 - 01:23:35.036, Speaker A: But I think that's something that to a lot of Bitcoin people, for example, is anathema. But a lot of Ethereum people I've talked to, I can just seem fine with it really interesting.
01:23:35.138 - 01:23:45.696, Speaker D: Okay, so maybe Ethereum will prove to be a good example of proof of stake for Bitcoiners to look at and see how it works. Maybe they'll copy it down the I.
01:23:45.718 - 01:24:08.490, Speaker A: Mean, it's not just about Bitcoin to be like, I hope Litecoin adopts proof of stake as mean. I hope Bitcoin Cash adopts proof of mean. I hope Bitcoin Satoshi's vision adopts proof of mean. I think the thing is a Scam, but I think Scams running proof of stake is still less environmentally harmful than Scams running proof of work. Harm reduction is supposed to be the mature attitude to have. So like, whatever.
01:24:15.760 - 01:24:32.720, Speaker D: Okay. And then I think, yeah, wrapping up and just looking forward, once Ethereum is running with this better proof of stake and sharding and it's more scalable, what do you think it can achieve in the next decade?
01:24:35.860 - 01:25:55.928, Speaker A: I still think there's a lot of unknowns decentralized finance is kind of the lowest risk thing, which is a funny thing to say because the crypto sector as a whole is still kind of much higher risk than some people often give it credit for. But it is just creating an open kind of global financial system that people can access to. People can have savings in, people can engage in contracts, get things like insurance, just get kind of services that are difficult for them to get using kind of traditional centralized tools. I think even that is I very much hope that's not the only thing Ethereum does, but even that is something that's very valuable all by itself. But in general, and I think in very vague terms, the vision is this idea that you can use crypto economic and decentralized systems to create kind of credibly neutral kind of social institutions and mechanisms. And this can create platforms that, if more people can trust and more people feel comfortable trusting, can kind of reach across barriers more easily.
01:25:56.024 - 01:25:57.260, Speaker D: You mean like DAOs?
01:25:57.680 - 01:26:57.170, Speaker A: So DAOs are one example of kind I'm interested in DAOs in the long term. I definitely think that present day Dow technology I agree with Vlad's opinion here that present day Dows are not super interesting. What Dows could be is super interesting and I really want to see kind of that gap being filled. I think in general there's this whole branch of kind of economic research into how do we do things like funding public goods. For example, I've been a big kind of evangelist for quadratic funding and people might have seen my recent blog post where I kind of described Gitcoin's recent quadratic funding round as a way of kind of detecting and funding public goods for the Ethereum ecosystem. Governance of kind of common shared resources, even things like Oracles, like all of these problems, DAOs are one valuable thing. Financial protocol is obviously another valuable thing.
01:26:57.170 - 01:28:08.230, Speaker A: The space of kind of combining together kind of crypto components with kind of internet and social media platforms I think is kind of an interesting thing. PPAs, for example, like I've talked about a few times, if you look at things like Steemit for example, this is something that it's theoretically part of EOS land. So we're kind of theoretically supposed to not consider it legitimate. But they've done a decent job at creating this kind of crypto incentivized platform for kind of content generation and at least getting it actively used by a user base of some size. And I think the mechanism design can be improved by a lot, but I think things like that and trying to kind of solve problems with just present day systems in a lot of cases that kind of incorporate elements of using blockchains as a base layer incorporate elements of mechanism design. But mechanism design done well and not just like slapping payments on top of everything and whatever without thinking through the consequences. There's a lot of good things that can happen.
01:28:08.230 - 01:28:14.890, Speaker A: I mean, prediction markets is another kind of big category of things that I find interesting too.
01:28:16.140 - 01:28:32.670, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it's a broad range of things that Ethereum can disrupt probably. Okay, and then just quickly to wrap up, if there's one thing you could tell vitalik sitting in EastWater Loot 2017, what would it be?
01:28:36.260 - 01:29:39.270, Speaker A: I mean, I mean the realistic and boring answer will be crypto prices will go down, sell and buy later. But this is how economists answer these type travel questions, right? Like provide a bit STRIG of what the stocks will do and then you can do really well and then hopefully use the earnings for good. But otherwise, I don't know. I want to think about kind of non lame answers to this question. The other kind of lame answer is just like here's all the bad e. Two ideas, like, skip straight past them and go to the good ones. Other thing in terms of things, that where I could have done better if I had kind of better models of the crypto space back then.
01:29:39.270 - 01:29:58.840, Speaker A: Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I think there was like I don't think there's a single big thing. I think there are just kind of a lot of little decisions about things that we could have focused on earlier that we didn't focus on earlier.
01:30:01.420 - 01:30:13.916, Speaker D: Okay. But I guess, yeah, short selling is a great answer. Well, yeah, I think we ran out of time. It was so interesting.
01:30:14.018 - 01:30:15.710, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Thank you.
01:30:23.720 - 01:30:31.210, Speaker B: We'll actually do three questions from the audience, and if you have a question, raise your hand. We'll come to you, and we'll just pass you the mic.
01:30:36.220 - 01:30:42.250, Speaker F: Am I picking okay, let me run one SEC.
01:30:47.120 - 01:31:02.640, Speaker B: Thanks. Vital, a quick question for you, and that's around immutability. You posted on this on Twitter a few weeks back, I guess. What's your thoughts based on the feedback you got from the community on immutability and what would happen if there was a massive attack on ethereum, rolling back, so on and so forth?
01:31:03.140 - 01:33:17.144, Speaker A: What's the feedback I got from the community on immutability issues? I think the thing that I underestimated is that it's not clear that kind of we're on the same page in terms of the framing of the issue. So one framing of the issue, and the one that I kind of had it from the beginning is like, okay, if there exists some hack that we could use a state intervention fork to reverse and get money back, from a hacker or stop a bug or do some other thing, then on the one hand there's good consequences, which are that people get their money back. Yay. On the other hand, there's a bad consequence, which is and it's kind of a fixed size bad consequence, which is we kind of erode the immutability principle more, and you have to kind of weigh the costs and the benefits, and there's some number at which the benefits become greater than the costs. But it seems like there is kind of a lot of different variables at stake. So things that I probably wasn't thinking about enough are one is the number of people affected and what kinds of behaviors were they participating in? Were they participating in things where they realistically expected, should have expected danger? Or was this something that was advertised as kind of the wallet that people should use? And also just measuring kind of the harm not just by looking at the amount of money stolen, but the number of people affected. Another thing is how disruptive would the intervention actually need to be and how many people would be harmed by disruptive intervention? Is there some way of compensating them? So there's a lot of these kind of other kind of complicated factors if we look at kind of arguments against doing an intervention it's not just about kind of breaking the principle or weakening the principle.
01:33:17.144 - 01:34:43.572, Speaker A: It's also about other things like just disrupting activity of the blockchain, like how much activity would be disrupted and these other things. So that was one thing. Another thing is that a lot of people don't have I think kind of either individually queer or kind of collectively queer mental models of what principles as a thing are in what ways principles as a thing are valuable. So I made this tweet where I basically asked do you think it's possible for a principal to literally have infinite weight? So it's never okay to give up that principle under absolutely any circumstance and to me the answer is obviously no. Principle hasn't literally infinite weight. If there was an alien invasion coming and the only way we could stop the alien invasion was by making it illegal to criticize blue light people then I love freedom of speech but if breaking freedom of speech would stop an alien invasion then sure I'd totally do it. And I have similar positions with respect to kind of pretty much every principle including blockchain immutability.
01:34:43.572 - 01:35:52.590, Speaker A: So kind of my model of this was like this principle is really important but it's not infinitely important. But first of all there's people who sort of say that it's infinitely important but I'm not sure that kind of under reflection they would actually hold onto this opinion. There's also kind of like bitcoin ethereum cultural divides a big extent to this because every time you make a Twitter poll there's always people from these other communities that kind of step in to show their opinions. I don't know, it's complicated. I'm definitely of the school of thought that says it's good to discuss it more and not of the school of thought that says that the fact that we're even willing to discuss it shows that the ethereum community does not value mutability and therefore we're the shitcoin. I think that school of thought is terrible and we should not listen to it at all. Yeah, I'm pro discussing things and holding to principles for reasons that we've kind of properly reflected on.
01:35:53.920 - 01:35:56.030, Speaker F: Okay, we'll do one more question.
01:35:57.840 - 01:35:58.492, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:35:58.626 - 01:36:31.450, Speaker B: Going back to the question about dows so you're talking about the gap between where we could be with the functionality of and the output of them versus where we are now. Obviously when we did the first experiment it was really like okay let's just do the dao and then we all put money into it. Now looking at some of the more experimentation on the Molok side with sort of moloch dao itself and now marketing dao that just launched MetaCartel a lot of the others it's this more like slow iterative process. What do you sort of think about the difference in large dow structure and fixing things like that versus the small dow structure and fixing things like that.
01:36:32.220 - 01:36:37.276, Speaker A: The differences between large Dow structure and small dow structure and the value in.
01:36:37.298 - 01:36:42.236, Speaker B: Terms of solving these problems. Right? So initially we started with a huge one and now we're doing this more.
01:36:42.258 - 01:38:43.910, Speaker A: Iterative small dows are definitely more like one of the reasons why Moloch Dao is more tractable is because it's made up of people who kind of largely know each other and who are kind of trusted to not do nasty things like automatically vote for whoever pays them the most money. I think if you kind of do Dows in context where kind of some level of social trust already exists, then the problem is more tractable. Whereas if you do it in context where social Trust doesn't exist or where people aren't even on the same page in terms of what okay conduct is and what okay conduct isn't, then the problem becomes more difficult. We saw this with EOS, for example, right? With EOS, the whole thing quickly collapsed into people bribing each other to vote for each other and creating this sort of plutocratic cartel where you have a fairly small number of people just help vote for each other and pay each other the B block producers. And at the beginning, I saw a lot of people arguing that, hey, bribing people buying people's votes is not illegitimate behavior because isn't this the free market? And aren't we about building a free market system? And when you have a system where people don't even this kind of layer of shared moral expectations isn't even there at the beginning, then you're relying on kind of just the raw economics in a much stronger way than you normally are and so the problem is more difficult. So in some Ways, I'm happy that kind of the simpler cases are being tried first and then we can kind of expand the scale more and more over time. One of the reasons I'm not in favor of on chain governance at all, for example, is because it's basically saying that, hey, let's make a Dow and let's start with a really big dow and, oh, by the Way, we're going to make the Dow be so systemically important that we give it control of layer one.
01:38:43.910 - 01:39:00.040, Speaker A: It's basically kind of combining all of the kind of ways of doing irresponsible Dow developments together, whereas this sort of start small and develop and have lots of little experiments approach I think, is going to be sort of more fruitful over the long term.
01:39:02.240 - 01:39:51.092, Speaker F: Okay, thank you so much, guys. Okay, so yeah, liberalism, radical markets bitcoin proof of Stake. Moment of silence for Dalek's DMs and notifications on Twitter after this. Okay, so I Got, like, two minutes of things to say and then We Can get out of here. I Know you've been Sitting patiently for quite some time, so I ask for your attention just for a brief moment. We're going to go over a couple last logistics, but First, I want to say a massive thank you to the people that are giving us access to this building, which, as you can see, is extremely stunning. This is the center for International Governance Innovation.
01:39:51.092 - 01:40:15.760, Speaker F: Interestingly. Actually, it's founded by Jim Balsilli, who is the guy that started the BlackBerry. And you might notice the Lazaritus room that we've had. That was his co founder who also started the Pyramid Institute across the street. But I want to say a huge shout out and please join me in giving thanks to CG for this beautiful space. Right on. So you've probably seen this thing.
01:40:15.760 - 01:40:29.332, Speaker F: This is the floor plan. Please take note of the yellow rooms. Lazarus room. Butran room. Napoleon room. The sponsors had mentioned this during their talks. And you see in the schedule, which I'll reference in a second.
01:40:29.332 - 01:40:49.640, Speaker F: This is where various sponsor talks and workshops are being given. You can see the pink area. That's where the food's going to be. We got lots of food for you guys. You're going to see another slide in that in a second. We are in the purple area now, in case you haven't oriented yourself, you can hack any of the available tables, any of these hacking spaces, and really enjoy the space. Take pictures, add them to Instagram.
01:40:49.640 - 01:41:10.240, Speaker F: It's really phenomenal, but important. Do not go up the stairs. You can go up the stairs that are in the main foyer, the open ones in the main open air area. But do not go up the stairs that are like in the regular stairwells. You will not have a happy experience immediately. You get kicked out. This actually, technically, I think it's a government building, so just be careful with that.
01:41:10.240 - 01:41:23.204, Speaker F: So don't go up the stairs. Like I mentioned, there's food. We got lots of food for you guys. There's food trucks. You can get them out. At the back of this area, we have the food service area. You probably got some curry earlier today from there.
01:41:23.204 - 01:41:43.068, Speaker F: Yeah, you're going to be very well fed. We've even put an enormous emphasis on healthy food. Not like the regular pizza you've got at a Hackathon. This is like grade A stuff. She'll be well fed. And then I got a bunch of quick things here. Number one, if you need help at any point in time, go to this great URL ethwaterloo.com
01:41:43.068 - 01:41:57.248, Speaker F: help. The team at ChainSafe has been very kind to us. They've set up this system which you can go to. It's literally a form like, I need help with what you can find me. Where here's how you can get in touch with me. Like literally anything. It's a basic system.
01:41:57.248 - 01:42:29.340, Speaker F: It'll go to a bunch of mentors who have communicated to us that they are willing to and available to help. So that's great. And additionally, thank you again to ChainSafe for a lot of the work on that. Additionally, you can also get help in a more of a peer to peer online way through Ethwaterloo.com chat. Now it's also important that even at this moment, if you can, that you get onto this chat server. Every official announcement, you got an announcement.
01:42:29.920 - 01:42:34.060, Speaker B: This is where we'll contact you if you're one of the winners. So please make sure you're on Discord.
01:42:34.400 - 01:43:03.048, Speaker F: Yeah, echoing what he said. This is like the place to be. All official announcements, the sponsor chat rooms are on there if you want to find people to work with. Basically what I'm trying to say is take this time while I'm speaking to load up your phone. Go to this website. It's really like this should be the beating heart of the event anyway, so go to this thing. Important note though, at this type of a hackathon, it's very easy to accidentally start downloading an enormous amount of data.
01:43:03.048 - 01:43:21.564, Speaker F: And although we have great internet directly fiber optically entered into this building. It's a great building. If you start doing all kinds of crazy stuff, you might screw it up. So make sure you do not sync a guest appearity node. That's the most common way you could mess this up. Don't do downloading 4K videos. Lower the bandwidth if you can.
01:43:21.564 - 01:43:36.812, Speaker F: Every little bit counts. We shouldn't have any problems. But just in case, don't do the obvious stupid things, please and thank you. Great. The full schedule you can get on Ethwaterloo.com, it's on the TVs outside. You can get anywhere.
01:43:36.812 - 01:44:04.024, Speaker F: Pretty much make sure you check this out. In about 17 minutes, the first workshops and talks are going to be starting in those yellow rooms I mentioned. So maybe take a moment, pick the ones you think are the most interesting to you. Sponsors mentioned a bunch of them earlier. I highly recommend going to one of those to kind of kick start the evening again, there's prizes which the sponsors had referenced. Ethworld.com prizes has all of them.
01:44:04.024 - 01:44:29.876, Speaker F: It's a good idea to kind of get acquainted to what they are, to even orient yourselves to which room to go to. And finally, this should go without saying, but this is a great environment, it's a fun environment, it's an easy environment. Don't break the rules. We have very clear rules if you want to know what they are precisely, but you should know what they are. This type of an event, be respectful. Don't harass others, don't abuse the situation anyway. Do unto others what you would expect them to do unto you.
01:44:29.876 - 01:44:35.670, Speaker F: Be respectful. So with that being said, let's get hacking. Thanks so much and let's get going.
01:44:56.390 - 01:44:57.634, Speaker A: Ahead. Hello.
01:44:57.752 - 01:44:58.370, Speaker B: Hey.
01:44:58.520 - 01:45:00.066, Speaker A: We're going to do team formation here.
01:45:00.088 - 01:45:01.586, Speaker B: So anybody that doesn't have a team.
01:45:01.688 - 01:45:05.120, Speaker A: Just stick here and we'll try and sort you out.
