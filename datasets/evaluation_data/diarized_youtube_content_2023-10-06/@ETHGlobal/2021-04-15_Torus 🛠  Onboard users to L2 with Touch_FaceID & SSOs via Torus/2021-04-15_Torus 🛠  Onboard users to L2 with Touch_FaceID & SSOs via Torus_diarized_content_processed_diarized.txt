00:00:15.850 - 00:00:17.760, Speaker A: We're good. Stream is up.
00:00:18.290 - 00:00:33.880, Speaker B: All right, awesome. And hey everyone, welcome to the Scaling Ethereum workshop off with Taurus. I'm Sean On from the ETH global team and I'm really honored to be joined by Chai, also from the Taurus team.
00:00:34.410 - 00:00:47.066, Speaker C: Yes, hello everyone, nice to be here. Do we wait for more people to join or I can just go ahead.
00:00:47.088 - 00:00:48.460, Speaker B: With yeah, you can go ahead.
00:00:49.070 - 00:01:37.350, Speaker C: Okay, so hello everyone, I'm Chai from Taurus by the way, as he introduced. And today we'll be just discussing about how to onboard users to l two with biometric authentication and SSOs using Openlogin. Openlogin is a new product by Taurus which we'll be going through today. And yeah, it's a very interesting concept and yes, initially let's just start with the hackathon price pool discussion. Okay, so right now Taurus is currently sponsoring four prizes which sum up to the net pool of 7500 USD coin and we offer prizes for the best integration with a L2 solution and also there's a run up for that. And also we also care about user flows. At Taurus we try to solve the problem of UX.
00:01:37.350 - 00:02:00.020, Speaker C: So a hack which basically presents the best user centric flows also deserves an award and that gets 1500 and then DAP which addresses a current issue within the ecosystem that also just gets another 1500 just because we want to support the ecosystem alone. Next, coming to the sorry.
00:02:03.270 - 00:02:05.380, Speaker A: That is all.
00:02:06.870 - 00:02:41.534, Speaker C: Anyways, so coming to Open login. So Open login is basically where passwordless auth meets private key management. We basically try to combine the simplicity of passwordless authentication with the security of the private key management. As everyone in this call most likely knows, taurus has been in this public infrastructure space for almost two years and we have made a name for ourselves with this. So let me just show the demo first and then we can just talk more about it. So the demo is here. Okay, so this Openloggin.com
00:02:41.534 - 00:03:23.770, Speaker C: website, all of you can basically go here and actually try the demo for yourselves, to be honest. And let me just start off with trying the demo. I'll just use one of the accounts here. It basically tries to detect my device and I can enable secure my account with a touch ID or Face ID. I'm currently using Windows, so let me just do my Windows Pin and yeah, it basically tries to reconstruct your TKEY and a bunch of other things and see you're logged in. Okay, so that was just basically registration of your account. And let's say if you want to log in all further subsequent logins will basically look like this.
00:03:23.770 - 00:04:03.110, Speaker C: You just make a request, you sign in with your biometrics and then you're done. As simple as that. So this is the beauty of Openlogin, it's very simple to use and it's very secure in terms of user privacy. We basically take user privacy very seriously. Coming to the next piece where I try to explain how Taurus works. And what is the Taurus stack, what we offer. So the Taurus infrastructure is basically the Taurus basically has an infrastructure which basically has a decentralized non custodial public infrastructure.
00:04:03.110 - 00:04:45.222, Speaker C: It's maintained by the users themselves and some large stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem. Currently there are around nine nodes, nine stakeholders in the ecosystem which run the Taurus nodes and keys are managed by multiple authentication factors. So in the Open login which you saw, the biometrics basically stores one of the authentication factors and the other authentication factor basically lives on your device. And one basically is your Google login. Okay, I'll be going into more detail about this later, but the idea here is that there is no central server, it's decentralized, and all of the ToRs code is open source. So you can just go to GitHub.com, Slash, Dorsearch and you can find all of this available over there.
00:04:45.222 - 00:05:28.822, Speaker C: And it's non custodial, fully public infrastructure designed to leverage on existing authentication systems. So the idea here is that you want to use existing authentication systems like Google, Facebook, passwordless and several other authentication systems which Web Two users are most familiar with and you want to provide them the Web Three experience. Normal users. When they basically come to Web Three directly, they feel a bit janky because of the UX challenges which are involved. So Taurus tries to simplify that by providing a familiar interface to people who are coming to Web Three. Okay, so Taurus infrastructure basically has a bunch of components built on top of it. So the first is custom.
00:05:28.876 - 00:05:29.190, Speaker A: Auth.
00:05:29.260 - 00:06:15.170, Speaker C: Custom Auth, so it basically only logins with full UX control. It's one of the flagship products of Taurus which is used by multiple companies in the blockchain ecosystem and blockchain space. And it's fully customizable authentication experience and it uses the underlying Taurus key infrastructure. Next, which is built is the Taurus Wallet. Taurus wallet is built on top of Custom Auth and the infrastructure. It is an Ethereum wallet which basically allows you to connect to a DAP just like MetaMask and other login providers. It provides seamless login experiences and it's interoperable with other decentralized applications.
00:06:15.170 - 00:06:45.690, Speaker C: Trollswallet also allows you to buy ETH through fiat to crypto providers and it also has a bunch of other loads of other features. And the last part of the stack is basically Openloggin. So Openlogin combines the Openloggin is an authentication suit which basically includes the Custom Auth internally and it also adds the beauty of Touch ID and Face ID and also some SSO so that you can connect up to any blockchain, not just Ethereum.
00:06:45.770 - 00:06:46.254, Speaker A: Okay?
00:06:46.372 - 00:07:14.694, Speaker C: That's the beauty of it. And all of this content is again hosted on the new website of our Tor US and all of these components basically combine to form the Tor stack. Our Torah stack is basically authentication and key management products. We basically build these solutions in a fully decentralized manner and non custodial manner so that users can leverage the power of blockchain in a very simple way.
00:07:14.812 - 00:07:15.478, Speaker A: Yes.
00:07:15.644 - 00:08:20.960, Speaker C: Now I would like to just go through about how taurus works, the node mechanism. So as I was talking about, taurus nodes are basically the entire node code is open source, it's non custodial and it's blockchain agnostic. So what we manage are just private keys and public keys. So how are accounts managed? Okay, so we leverage existing threshold key schemes such as shami secret sharing to provide seamless flexible key management solution which cater to all the audiences. And the way it works is user keys are basically split into a threshold scheme, into shares which are secured on a mixture of authentication methods and user devices. So let's say you have a Google login, Facebook login, it comes up to one share and your device comes up as one more share and you can have other devices which come as other shares. So all three shares basically combine to form your actual private key.
00:08:20.960 - 00:08:49.126, Speaker C: And you may be wondering what happens if Google basically hacks my account. So in such cases, Google won't be able to get full access of your account because it only comprises of one share. So you have other two shares such as your laptop and mobile which are still yours. So Google cannot take instruct key with one share. You'll need at least a threshold number. Let's say the threshold number is two, the minimum is two. You need at least two of these three to construct your final key.
00:08:49.126 - 00:10:01.626, Speaker C: And further, in order to give you more security, the Google share is again split into a number of subshares via the distributed key generation protocol which is chami secret sharing across the nodes which are run by large ecosystem stakeholders. So right now the current partners are these partners which are like very big names in the blockchain ecosystem currently and the user, clients and node operators, basically all of these, they form the taurus key infrastructure which forms the base for the entire taurus stack and it's fully open source. Again, I can't stress this enough and we have more exciting things coming up built on top of the tourist key infrastructure which includes some DIDs digital ownership and much more things. And yeah, we have a beautiful documentation site which is ready which is already live and you guys can just start using it. Okay, you'll find more information about what I'm speaking over there. And yes, for the hackathon, everyone needs to integrate open login. So the first place to start that is at developer portal.
00:10:01.626 - 00:10:15.940, Speaker C: We have a nice developer portal where you guys can create an account and then just install your create apps related to it. So let me just sorry.
00:10:19.590 - 00:10:20.466, Speaker A: Yeah, let.
00:10:20.488 - 00:10:41.974, Speaker C: Me just try to log in. Surprisingly fail. Let me just use a different account. Yeah, okay, this is an admin dashboard.
00:10:42.022 - 00:10:42.780, Speaker A: My bad.
00:10:46.910 - 00:10:48.426, Speaker C: Let me just use some other thing.
00:10:48.448 - 00:10:56.282, Speaker A: I guess it. Yes.
00:10:56.416 - 00:11:03.126, Speaker C: So once you when you create a developer dashboard, you can just specify a.
00:11:03.128 - 00:11:07.506, Speaker A: Couple of things and you can create.
00:11:07.528 - 00:11:49.360, Speaker C: Your own workspace where you will be presented with a neat little dashboard which also explains the different parts of the stack. You basically get a very simple explanation of what everything is comprised of. And you have now some really nice good quick starts about Openlogin. And also you can create a project on Open login. So you can just go here and then you can create a project. I'll just enter Taurus test project so that created a project and then you have a project ID and a project secret. And this is also a place where you can whitelist the redirect URLs for your authentication application.
00:11:49.360 - 00:12:32.830, Speaker C: So localhost is allowed by default, but non localhost URLs need to be whitelisted here and that would simply help you with the integration. So at any point if you need to refer to the documentation, you can just go to Docstock Order US. This basically has a bunch of stuff available for you. I'll just go through it again. This comes in again. So as you can see, you can create Openlogin project and you can install our SDK which is coming to the documentation. So you can see that the Openlogin documentation is quite comprehensive.
00:12:32.830 - 00:13:21.386, Speaker C: You have a bunch of guides which are available for interacting with different blockchains. Right now we have ethereum, solana, binance, smart chain, polygon, and even more, to be honest, So you'll have some details about what is Openlogin and a bunch of other things. And you also have a full API reference on how to install it using script, tag, NPM or Yarn. You have some basic examples here and you can get the entire API reference regarding the entire thing. Okay, all of this is available, people can go through it during the hackathon. And we also have a beautiful integration builder which allows you to which gives you code Snippet which you can just directly copy paste for the integration. So Openlogin actually supports bunch of blockchains as you can see here.
00:13:21.386 - 00:14:01.610, Speaker C: Solana, Polygon, binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, ZK, Sync, arbitra and every other blockchain you can think of. So if you are using any other custom blockchain, please reach out to us on the developer group and we'll just add a guide for you. It's not a big deal and the steps are beautifully laid out here. As you can see. You basically start with registering an application on your developer dashboard where you get the client ID and you can just use the Iframe URL or network over here. And then you instantiate the SDK this way and then once you instantiate it, you can just call in it. And then you basically call Login.
00:14:01.610 - 00:14:56.966, Speaker C: You trigger the login which basically retrieves the user's private key. And you can use that private key to basically connect to any of the wallet providers like for Ethereum or similar cases for other blockchains which you have and you can just simply call Logout to log the user out at the end. So more functionality is obviously present in the API reference and you can always refer to our guides which are available on how to add Open Login to a React application or a View application or Ethereum DAP Solana Polygon. There are like huge number of examples over here which you can just refer to and you can obviously reach out to us on the Developer Dashboard. We'll be glad to help any 24/7. So we want to support all of you in order to build the best possible integration in hackathon. The next is Open Login Integration Builder, which I just showed.
00:14:56.966 - 00:15:40.106, Speaker C: And I also showed the guides where you can use the Open Login and Developer dashboard. Yeah, that's pretty much it. And we are available on the official telegram group at t me torres labs. The developer group is t me. Torreslab this presentation will be shared with the participants at the end of the hackathon at the end of this presentation and you'll also be able to join our Discord Group and you can also DM our Twitter. The most ideal place for you guys to reach us is the Telegram Developer Group where we'll be always active. Please do reach out to us.
00:15:40.106 - 00:15:47.082, Speaker C: Please do ask more questions. We would love to see some wonderful integrations. And the floor is open for questions.
00:15:47.136 - 00:15:47.820, Speaker A: I guess.
00:15:54.190 - 00:16:03.470, Speaker C: It I'm assuming the more questions will be posted here, link to the Torres hackathon.
00:16:15.050 - 00:16:15.960, Speaker A: Or something.
00:16:16.730 - 00:16:39.962, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks everyone for kind of know being here. And also again, if you have any questions, feel free to pop them in the chat. Yeah, and thank you so much shy for the demo. If you have any questions afterwards, please feel free to drop them into the Discord chat under the Sponsor Taurus Channel. But otherwise appreciate everyone for attending and feel free to ask questions whenever.
00:16:40.146 - 00:16:44.890, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you everyone for attending the presentation and best of luck.
