00:00:05.770 - 00:00:31.800, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you all for joining us on this Friday afternoon evening, Saturday morning, depending on where you are, we are on day two of the Dao Hacks workshop. We have Melania and Alex here from Scale Wallet, who will be doing their workshop on Own Your Own Identity. Any questions, go into the Zoom chat and Amelina and Alex will answer them as they go. And with that being said, I'll hand the mic off to the two of them.
00:00:32.890 - 00:00:33.414, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:33.452 - 00:01:24.066, Speaker C: Hello everyone. So thank you for joining us and thank you for your interest in Skill Wallet. Now, before further ado, let me share my screen and I have a presentation for you. Now, Skill Wallet lets you home your own identity and we do that especially as a membership tool for dows. The main value for this is that dows themselves are the backbone of Web Three as we know it today. And decentralized communities are per se a completely new, brand new Web Three native way to interact and collaborate. The issue with that is that they're still using, well, let's say, outdated tools and they are still largely based on reputation, made up of, let's say, governance tokens and other tools that are based on their initial capital.
00:01:24.066 - 00:03:01.330, Speaker C: Now, this generates multiple problems. For example, the way to allocate value within a community that needs to be self sustainable as a business in order to let people coordinate and create projects that make sense to them and can realize their vision. As well as, for example, many members of a Dao being either unable to actually understand what to do or starting to have a parasitic behavior just to track possible airdrops or things like this. Now, what we do with Skill Wallet is to tie an identity with the community that members join so that first of all, there is a more efficient and transparent way for members to interact, to contribute to the community, and there is a value alignment as well as replacing legacy tools. So for example, you can directly create a bridge between Web Two and Web Three without disrupting habits that the community has and the culture that they created and also reflects social dynamics because itself, a Skill Wallet contains someone's skills and someone's roles. So that, again, in every aspect of our society and all the communities that we know, from HS Club to university to even a startup team, everybody has clear roles and knows exactly what to do. Also, our suite of products allows you to create dow as well as a complete set of tasks and milestones for your community without the need to be a tech expert.
00:03:01.330 - 00:03:42.018, Speaker C: So you can create something that really creates impact in the world, follows your vision, and involving others with that without, again, being a tech wizard. We have five main products in our product suite. The first one is the partners agreement. That's how all starts. You can easily deploy a dow that works exactly like every other dow in the world. Plus on the top of it has this role based native governance module. After that, you have a mobile app that allows you to tie directly your identity to your mobile device to increase civil resistance and it lets you also see what is happening in your community.
00:03:42.018 - 00:04:56.010, Speaker C: So the open tasks, all of your experience, your commitment, as well as the rewards that you are going to receive. The most important part of the Skill Wallet product suite itself is the decentralized authentication system that basically works like Google. So you can use your unique Skill Wallet ID to log in in every protocol, in every DApp and platform in the web Three space, just simply logging in or scanning a QR code. The most operational functional part, let's say both for the founders of a community as well as their members, are the partners dashboard that lets you basically fly on a deck so you can immediately create tasks. See at glance how your community is doing, the health of your community and all the different members and roles that are available there. And the discord bot. So you can integrate our Discord bot directly in your server and share tasks that exist on chain, as well as for example, polls for governance and voting directly on Discord, record reactions on Discord and reflect this directly on Chain.
00:04:56.010 - 00:06:18.680, Speaker C: Now, going a little bit deeper into that. Again, as we said, Skill Wallet ties identities and DAOs so that we unlock role based governance. So each member of each community directly has a role at the registration as well as, for example, letting you choose and customize very important things in your dow. So for example, the market you're active in or whether you want two or three roles, what are these roles and the commitment that you expect from each one of your members, from the members perspective? Again, you can immediately log in as the traditional experience of connecting your wallet and together with adding your avatar and your nickname that are very familiar experiences and fully pseudonymous, you can immediately pick the role and the commitment that you want to have in that specific community. So that really represents you and you are identified with basically what you do instead of your location or your full name. The last but not least important part is the Partners dashboard, as we said, and from here you can really do anything that is related to your community, invite your members, invite your core team, as well as creating and sharing tasks or expanding your dao, adding decentralized tools. On the top of it.
00:06:18.680 - 00:07:22.460, Speaker C: What we've been trying to build is something a complete infrastructure that really expands the personal freedom of individuals. Not only web3 but we are starting with this and is based on a fully web3 native and modular architecture. So that we really tried to create an identity Lego that focuses on the individuals that are, let's say the core of each Tao that aims to be fully decentralized things that we know are possible and we would like to see are for example, let's say sweet spot between native governance and non chain analytics. So profit sharing. And now, without further ado, before leaving the word to Milena, I will share my screen and show you some very interesting wait, let me see where I place this. I'm sorry. Just the pleasure of live.
00:07:22.460 - 00:07:53.410, Speaker C: Okay, so we have it. Now, without further ado, I will show you our documentation so that you can have a glance, anything that can help you to start off and what prices we're focusing on. Now, this is our notion page. You can find it at docs skillvallet. ID. These are some of the possibilities and very simple things that you can achieve with Skillvallet in a few minutes. While our about nothing relevant there, you already know about us.
00:07:53.410 - 00:08:38.606, Speaker C: And this is Intro Video with a tutorial for integrating Skill Wallet as a decentralized authentication system and claiming the first wallet. Also a link to our YouTube channel where there are other tutorials. Now, for this Akaton, we set quite a nice price, mostly for something that is active in the area of public goods. As we mentioned, this is our main focus. And things like activism with or without an H and social issues are definitely something that can be achieved or can be tackled using our technology, or at least what we would like to see. There are some judging criteria. Most of these integrations do not require particular skills.
00:08:38.606 - 00:09:24.000, Speaker C: Mostly we're interested to see what you build on the top of it. There is also a very basic pool price. You can get 100 USDCs just by integrating Skill Wallet or doing anything with it that may take two minutes, and is mostly for letting newcomers in the space to explore our technology and try out new things. And a few ideas I mentioned you already about profit sharing and anything, any creative solution that is really focused on creating social impact using roles, sovereign identities, and anything that we built. Other things, you can read them by yourself and want to take too much of your time. So let me see. There are a couple of questions.
00:09:28.550 - 00:09:29.938, Speaker B: I covered them.
00:09:30.104 - 00:09:41.702, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you, Mila. All right, so I guess we are on time. So maybe Milan, would you like to share something and go to the dev site?
00:09:41.836 - 00:10:18.114, Speaker B: I'm going to share my screen. That's what I'm going to share. Hi, everyone. Let me know if you don't see my screen. Otherwise, what I'm aiming is to walk you through creating the community for your product, whatever you're building, show you how to integrate the web component in your app, and then walk you through the dashboard. Very briefly, since we're short on time, we're not going to do everything. We're not going to do all the integrations here.
00:10:18.114 - 00:10:45.660, Speaker B: I've set up some things so this is the partners agreement. And this is the very first step for integrating the ski wallet. Here you customize your community and very importantly, you customize the roles for your community. We have two different types of membership within Skewwallet. We have core team members and community members. And here those are the roles for the community members. The core team ones are predefined by us.
00:10:45.660 - 00:11:24.920, Speaker B: When you sign this, you're going to deploy two contracts under the hood. We deploy it. It's the partners agreement, which is taking care of everything related to tasks, integrations, et cetera, and community, which is basically your membership contract. So after you deploy this, you're going to get this very nice partners key that you should be very careful not to lose because you need it for integrating your component in your app. I have done that. I already created a partner community for us, for this tutorial. And now let's see how we integrate it.
00:11:24.920 - 00:12:13.830, Speaker B: Can I move this? Okay, you don't see this, but I have this very annoying zoom thing. So this is our NPM package. And here are instructions on how to integrate with react angular view JS. And if you have any issues or you want to integrate in some other frameworks, you can let us know. So I have here this absolutely empty let me move this absolutely empty react app. And what I'm going to do now is to integrate our ski wallet and installing the library. I will copy paste here this example, add a few imports.
00:12:13.830 - 00:12:37.680, Speaker B: And here I'm going to change this key to the one that I got after I deployed our testing dow. And since we are on polygon, we are setting use dev to true.
00:12:38.370 - 00:12:39.440, Speaker A: Let's start.
00:12:45.810 - 00:13:15.754, Speaker B: So this is how our web component looks like. And again this annoying zoom thing. And since I created our, I already am a member of this partners community that I created for this workshop. Let's see if I can log in. Yeah, that's the correct account. Yes. So this is how you log in now by clicking here.
00:13:15.754 - 00:13:39.810, Speaker B: It's very nice. UX. As you can see, you could log out and if you want to create new user, I should change now my account because I already have a ski wallet with this one. Let's change it to this. I'm again injecting my metmask. Introduce yourself. I'm a hacker.
00:13:39.810 - 00:14:19.054, Speaker B: I will upload a picture. And this here are the member roles. Now, if I continue with this flow, I'm going to join as a member, as a normal community member. Now let's see how we actually manage the core team membership. So in order to do that, I am going to log in here with the account that I use to create to create this community. And this is our dashboard. Now here on the right, we see core team and community.
00:14:19.054 - 00:14:59.660, Speaker B: If we go to core team, this is how I set up the data with the nice Dao hacks logo here, we can see members. It's quite a ghost town here because it's only me. And now let's see how we actually invite and how we gain like core team members. So this is the core team whitelist and before your core team member creates their skew wallet, you should first whitelist them here. So let's whitelist alex. Please note, Alex is just another MetaMask account, but that's fine. Great.
00:14:59.660 - 00:15:13.200, Speaker B: And now it should work, but it's a live demo, so who knows?
00:15:18.280 - 00:15:19.540, Speaker C: Here we pray.
00:15:22.840 - 00:15:57.600, Speaker B: Okay, great. So Alex is now a core team member and Alex is actually this account that I'm using here. So let's see, let's see what changes now for us. I'm once again injecting I'm Alex now. And here, now we can see the core team member roles. And this is important because this is how we actually have core team members. And once someone is added as core team member, they can actually access the partner's dashboard.
00:15:57.600 - 00:16:39.470, Speaker B: Let's set some commitment level. And now we're going to wait for a bit to upload the NFT metadata in IPFS and all of that. We confirm the transaction and we're going to see a QR code that we can scan with our mobile device in order to activate the so okay, now we can have core team members looking around and doing stuff with our dashboard. And now let's see what this dashboard can actually do. That's the QR code. Okay, I'm not going to scan it now. We're still short on time, by the way, if you have any questions.
00:16:39.470 - 00:17:48.420, Speaker B: Actually there are some no, nothing? Okay, if you have any questions, drop it in the chat. So a few configurations that we can do with our partners dashboard. If we're using skew wallet on the main net, then our web component is actually going to check if you're integrating it in a domain that is verified by you. And this prevents me from stealing all of your keys or whoever else stealing your keys and integrating your authentication system, your community in their websites on dev. This is disabled because we are hacking and doing stuff and we want to be flexible. So this is one thing that we can do. This here tomorrow is going to change very nicely and you will be able to add your webhook for a specific channel of your discord server where our app is going to post messages whenever you create a task.
00:17:48.420 - 00:18:33.952, Speaker B: So stay tuned. As you can see, we're also hacking on this hackathon and the important part is our events. So we have three different types of events and we have released one of them because the other two rely on our discord bot that is going to be released in the next few weeks. One, hopefully now we have open tasks. Those are the tasks that core team members can create and can take and finalize and by doing so, gain interaction, counters, index. And this is a very nice way to actually measure value. So when you create a task, you can select if it's for community or core team.
00:18:33.952 - 00:19:26.356, Speaker B: Let's go for core team. You can select for which role and how many members should participate. Let's select all. Then you just describe your task which is going to be submit your work too much. Let's go to submit your don't forget to submit blah blah, blah, and you create a task. Again, this is live demo and we hope that nothing is going to fail, but you never know. Now those tasks are entirely on chain and there is a little state machine dealing with them.
00:19:26.356 - 00:19:55.048, Speaker B: You can read in our documentation. But basically one core team member creates a task and another one can take it. And then the creator should finalize it. And this way they approve that everything went well and all of that. Now here is the step. Well, we actually send a message to your Discord server if you have configured your webhook. This currently sends it to our Discord server and now we can see all of the team tasks.
00:19:55.048 - 00:20:36.536, Speaker B: This is one I created earlier and another team member can get here and be like, yeah, I'm going to do that. Then they can submit their work and finally I would be able to finalize it. We don't have time for this entire flow, but this is basically how the task management work within the core team members on our dashboard. And that's pretty much it for the important part. The other things that you can see here is members. Very nice list of them. Those are roles currently.
00:20:36.536 - 00:20:43.950, Speaker B: Again, it's quite of a ghost town. And yeah, now we are open to any questions you guys have.
00:20:46.000 - 00:20:50.510, Speaker C: So. Thank you, Milana. I've already answered quite a few questions in the.
00:20:53.280 - 00:21:28.040, Speaker B: One thing I missed. One thing if you would like to we have this API that basically the only thing that it does is to make queries to our contracts and gather a little bit more information about the Skew wallets. So if you would like to use the API for displaying something, on showcasing something on your app, you can see it here. You can also find it in the documentation. But yeah, this is a very simple swagger and again, sorry Alex for the interruption.
00:21:31.600 - 00:21:59.780, Speaker C: So thank you for interrupting me. It was a useful one. Yeah. So you can find this at docs skillvallet ID. It's just a simple link API documentation. I answered quite a few questions in the while, mostly about how to rescue your Skill wallet if you lose your device and how to integrate it. So Saurav, regarding your question, I think today's are much more than enough.
00:21:59.780 - 00:22:55.590, Speaker C: All what Milena showed you can be done in like five minutes. So you can deploy your dao very quickly. And that's mainly up to you just to think about what you want your dow to be. So it's more the time that you spend just to write a description to really try to align your values and what you want to share with your community rather than the integration time. Also, as we mentioned earlier, we designed the application like the DAP on the top of our protocol so that anybody can actually create something of value, something that really resonates with them, even if they are not tech wizards. So again, our goal is to bring maximum possible value, hiding the complexity behind it. Any other question?
00:22:57.340 - 00:23:01.450, Speaker A: Feel free to take yourself off mute if you want to ask your questions live.
00:23:03.020 - 00:23:05.530, Speaker C: Yeah, please, any question is welcome.
00:23:09.340 - 00:23:12.990, Speaker B: Well, I'm hoping that we are just very clear.
00:23:15.440 - 00:23:39.860, Speaker C: We had quite a few questions written once, so maybe they are just hacking on Skill Wallet already. They don't want to hear us anymore, right? Alex, quick question. Can we deploy the agreements partnership programmatically or should we go only to the dashboard?
00:23:40.840 - 00:24:00.140, Speaker B: Everything that you can do from the dashboard, you can also do it by calling Smart Contracts. The only thing is that it's not currently in our documentation. It's not very well documented how to do it outside our dashboard. But if this is what you want to do, just ping me on discord and I'm going to give you super good instructions.
00:24:00.560 - 00:24:01.710, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:24:02.720 - 00:24:03.708, Speaker B: No worries.
00:24:03.874 - 00:24:11.160, Speaker C: Thank you, Javier. Also, Milena, we have another question from Jeff. Is there just one instance of Smart Skill Wallet?
00:24:11.320 - 00:24:44.184, Speaker B: I read it, yeah. Basically, with every partner's agreement that you sign, you deploy a community and the partners agreement contract. The Skew Wallet contract is only one. It's NFT contract. It's ERC 721 with a lot a lot of functionality except for being an NFD. Also, it's non transferable. Yes, your Skew wallet is tied to an address.
00:24:44.184 - 00:24:51.950, Speaker B: Basically, the address owns the NFT identity. Maybe I should read those questions before.
00:24:53.920 - 00:25:40.872, Speaker C: Also. Well, you can read more about this in the documentation, but we have quite a few upgrades planned for this, so it will be more flexible in the future. But anyway, the main goal of this and then I leave to Milena to answer this last question. The main goal of this is to make sure that your identity can grow with you so it keeps track of all of your reputation, all the different contributions you make to the different communities and so on, without you switching it many times or being able, for example, to create infinite wallets just to basically attack a community or having a random behavior. That's it. So Elena, I let you go with the last question and I guess our time is up.
00:25:41.006 - 00:25:55.730, Speaker B: Yeah. So the question is, how do we randomize the token IDs for the NFTs? And the answer is that we don't. We don't randomize them. We start from zero and counter plus one. We did not see a reason or value in randomizing them.
00:25:57.460 - 00:26:38.220, Speaker C: Rather, it's actually a nice feature because you can see the progression and sometimes also there are limited amount of members that the community can have. So you can see at what time someone joined and what is their progressive number, so whether they were the first in the alpha, the last one, very last spot. So we made it to feature any last of the last questions. Saurav, we read a lot of questions from okay, thank you, Savorov. Best of luck with your hack.
00:26:40.240 - 00:26:47.730, Speaker A: I think there's one more question that was sent in the chat just now. Is all the data public?
00:26:48.820 - 00:27:01.430, Speaker B: Yes, all the data is public. We have no sensitive data. We try not to steal any data from our users. So all of it is public?
00:27:02.840 - 00:27:22.364, Speaker C: Yeah. Also, I mean, it's a fully pseudonymous identity, so basically it's just built based around your skills, your communities, your commitment, your work. So there is nothing to steal. So, Anna, I think we are done. Yeah.
00:27:22.482 - 00:28:03.928, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Alex and Melina, for taking the time out of your Friday evening, your time to host this wonderful workshop for the hackers. As Alex and Melania said, they are available on Discord, so feel free to reach out to them there and they will be available all weekend. They want to give 100% support for all of you, so thank you so much. And for the rest of you, we do have a team formation workshop starting now, so check your hacker dashboard for that link. If you don't have a team, or if you're still looking for members for your team, definitely recommend going there. Our team member Luke is facilitating that call and he's awesome.
00:28:03.928 - 00:28:10.810, Speaker A: So have a great rest of your Fridays or Saturdays, depending on where you are. And yeah, thank you.
00:28:11.340 - 00:28:13.450, Speaker B: Thank you. Enjoy your hacking, you.
00:28:13.900 - 00:28:15.060, Speaker C: Bye bye, hack.
