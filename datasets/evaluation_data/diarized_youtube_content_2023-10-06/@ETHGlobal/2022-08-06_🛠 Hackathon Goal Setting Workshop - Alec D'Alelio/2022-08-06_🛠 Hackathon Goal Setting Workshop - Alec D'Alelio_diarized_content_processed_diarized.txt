00:00:06.250 - 00:00:51.580, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. We are joined by some pretty cool people today. Excited to see Alec from Mochi joining us here for a really informative presentation on how to set goals for your hackathon and how to get the most out of your hackathon experience. We will be taking questions at the end, so please definitely just hang on to those and put them in the chat while you're thinking about them. We do need your interaction, we do need your participation, but definitely hold on to those so that everything can run smoothly. Without further ado, though, Alec from Mochi Game Protocol, we would love to hear more about what it means to set goals for a hackathon. Take it away.
00:00:52.590 - 00:01:35.514, Speaker B: All right, thank you guys for the intro. I'm super excited to be here. I'm a longtime fan of Zora and I spend a lot of my time thinking and engaging with on chain creative technology, the stuff that we're all here to build and talk about. So very excited to be here. Thank you to Zora for having us. This is going to be a little bit of a different session, I imagine, than a lot of what has happened so far. This is kind of an opportunity to take a step back and think critically about the goals that we're actually setting for the coming days and the coming weeks for those of you who choose to take your projects beyond the scope of the hackathon itself.
00:01:35.514 - 00:02:03.934, Speaker B: So I'm really appreciative that you guys have taken the time to be here. I'm sure you're eager to start building. Some of you have probably already started building your projects, but I personally, and we at Mochi, think that it's really important to set aside some time to engage critically with goal setting in order to be the most effective at achieving whatever it is that you're here to achieve. So thank you for being here. Again. My name is Alec. I'm a core contributor at Mochi.
00:02:03.934 - 00:02:43.682, Speaker B: I focus mainly on partnerships and Dao success. And I'll tell you a little bit about Mochi a little bit more about Mochi later. But the TLDR is that we are an agile coordination game to help remote teams, decentralized communities, creative collectives, and everything in between to stick together. Our motto is to dream big, start small, and stick together. So a little bit about me personally before we get into the goal setting. I have been in and out of the Web Three Blockchain Space 2017. My introduction to the space was this book that you see here on the left called Everything in Its Right Place.
00:02:43.682 - 00:03:40.974, Speaker B: I helped put together this manuscript and publish this book on how blockchain technology would create a more transparent music industry. So while many people, I think, come into Web Three crypto through the lens of money and finance, I came into it through the lens of rights management, royalty streaming, things like that, artist and fan relationships. And I've kind of kept that focus ever since. A lot of what I've done over the past couple of years has been focused on the Dow and NFT space. I minted my first music, NFT on Zora back in March 2021, about the same time I minted this adorable little mooncat here. I was also a founding member of Beat Style, which is a collective that was born out of the Euler Beats Project, one of the earliest examples of generative music on the blockchain. We've worked with Snoop Dogg's team to do a couple of their drops.
00:03:40.974 - 00:04:36.594, Speaker B: We've worked with Quantum, we did one of their Genesis drops and Neon Cat and some others. And around the same time as all of that, about May of last year, I started working on Mochi. So the work that we do now is focused on supporting DAOs, supporting decentralized communities of all different shapes, sizes, and flavors to stick together, build culture through the act of setting and tracking goals. And then, lastly, I've done my fair share of transacting. I don't know at this point whether to wear this as, like, a badge of honor or shame that I've done so many transactions with so much GWe, but I've been here for just a little while. So what is mochi? I hope that many of you in here are already aware of what Mochi is. Mochi being the snack in this case because it's delicious.
00:04:36.594 - 00:05:11.710, Speaker B: But for those of you who are not aware, mochi is a Japanese rice cake made of short grain rice and usually other ingredients like cornstarch, water and sugar. It's pounded into a paste and molded into different shapes. Here, as you can see, these guys are pounding some Mochi. I think that they're actually the fastest. They have, like, the record for fastest Mochi production. So just like this process helps thousands of little grains of rice stick together to create something sweet, intangible and cohesive. We try to do the same for decentralized communities.
00:05:11.710 - 00:06:23.334, Speaker B: So again, that's what inspires us. We work to keep communities stuck together through a combination of token incentives, agile principles, and, of course, Tamagotchi style kauai cute Mochi companions who essentially serve as a living indicator of your accountability to your goals. So now I want to get into a little bit of goal theory, some of the goal theory that actually inspired Mochi and that continues to inspire the work that we're doing. Now. I'm going to talk through some of that theory, and then we're going to do a couple quick exercises to help you guys set some clear actionable goals for this week and hopefully establish some goal setting practices that you can take into future projects, future hackathons, and hopefully even into your personal lives and personal goals. So a couple just terms, just to make sure that we're aligned on definitions. Here, we're defining goal setting as the act of charting measurable steps to propel you toward a desired outcome over a predetermined period of time.
00:06:23.334 - 00:07:51.442, Speaker B: So a couple of things here. You'll see that measurable is emphasized. I'm going to get into that a bit more later. But this is kind of a key point, right? If you're setting the goal of I want to read more, I want to become an avid reader, that's going to be a lot less effective than something like, I'm going to read every morning before work, ten pages or more, right? Just the act of having a goal be measurable and being clear about your desired outcome and being clear about the scope or the amount of the period of time during which you're going to actually work towards your goal makes goals more effective. So a couple more kind of mochi specific terms a journey, right? Ideally, effective goals are not ones that you are going to be working toward forever, right? Most goals should be reassessed at a certain point, either because you've made considerable progress toward them, maybe you've even completed them, but we believe that goals should be continually reassessed. And so a journey is a period of time during which one tracks a goal, ideally with a small team of people who kind of serve as accountability buddies. This is another core thing, right, where you're more likely to actually be accountable to a goal if you have folks other than yourself holding you accountable, right? Reminding you there's an added incentive there.
00:07:51.442 - 00:08:42.660, Speaker B: So eight weeks is kind of a standard amount of time for this. From our perspective. We have built our system around agile principles for all the developers and technically minded, product minded folks in the room. You're probably aware of agile and scrum, but basically it's this idea of breaking up work into chunks of different amounts of time and scope. So eight weeks or two months is traditionally an agile epic where you would maybe work on a specific feature. Those eight week epics are broken into two week sprints where you set smaller goals and then those sprints are split up into daily stand up meetings. So this daily stand up, right? It's a bit difficult to do this kind of thing if you are a distributed remote team.
00:08:42.660 - 00:09:26.660, Speaker B: So we understand that it's not always easy for people to meet at the same time every day. But that being said, it's still important to be tracking your progress on your goals. So that's where these pearls of wisdom, as we call them, come in, or proof of work, which is essentially a daily check in or progress update on your goal. That could be a journal entry, it could be a Mochi report or a voice note, whatever it may be. So this is what a pearl of wisdom looks like in Mochi, where you actually are completing a quick progress update on your goal in discord or in slack earning tokens for doing so and hopefully developing a streak. You got a zorb there. If you know, you know.
00:09:26.660 - 00:10:33.720, Speaker B: And just to give a quick example, of how this has been used in a creative context. Campfire is one organization, an artist union of sorts, of about 100 folks, people who are releasing music on the blockchain or who are working with organizations that are working to elevate on chain creative tooling. So this group was essentially spawned from this tweet a couple of months ago. And when the group was formed, they decided to use Mochi at the very inception to keep folks working toward common goals. So we had about 20 people working on goals like songwriting, recording, vocal exercises, things like that. And we found that people who set small measurable goals, like performing a 30 minutes vocal warm up every day, were really successful in achieving that while actually making some new friends in the process. So that's just a quick overview of the Mochi terminology and how our system works.
00:10:33.720 - 00:11:37.126, Speaker B: I'd like to get into a little bit more specifics around goal theory and some best practices for setting goals now. So the framework that we are going to use today to talk about our goals and reflect on our goals for the coming days and weeks is called Smart Goal Setting. So this is an acronym, as you may have noticed, and it is specific measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time Bound. So it's good when setting goals to kind of go through a mental checklist of is this a goal that is specific? Is it a goal that's measurable? Is it actually attainable or is it super lofty? Is it relevant to the context in which you're setting the goal and is it time bound? So specific. I think this one is pretty self explanatory. The more descriptive that you are with your goal, the easier it will be to track your progress and to actually report and reflect on the goal. Measurable.
00:11:37.126 - 00:12:39.178, Speaker B: This is I kind of alluded to before with the example of reading. If you are working toward a goal of becoming an avid reader, okay, that's great, but how are you actually assessing and measuring your progress toward that goal? Right? So something like in order to become an active reader, I will read ten pages or more every day before work. Something like that is going to be a lot easier to actually check in on and to accomplish. And that goes into the next point. The goal should be attainable, right? All of us here, I assume, are if you find yourself in this room at this hackathon, I assume that you're an ambitious person, right? We all want to affect change in this space. But a curse of being ambitious is that you might be more prone to setting over ambitious goals, right? And the problem with setting over ambitious goals is that you're setting yourself up potentially for disappointment. You're setting yourself up to become demotivated.
00:12:39.178 - 00:13:26.320, Speaker B: You're potentially setting yourself up to sour relationships with the people you're working with. So this is a really important one, right? Goals should be attainable they should not be too lofty. You should set yourself up to actually outperform your goals, if anything. Right? I personally hear this a lot in the space that the best teams are those who under promise and over deliver, right? So I think that that's a helpful way to think about this. Maybe under promise and over deliver with yourself so that if you set the goal of reading ten pages and you read 20, you're going to feel great about it, right? But if you set the goal of I'm going to read 100 pages a day and then you only read 60. Sure, reading 60 pages is great, but you might be disappointed. So I think that one's really important.
00:13:26.320 - 00:14:23.440, Speaker B: And then the last two relevant. We're all here, as I mentioned before, to affect some change to build the next generation of onchain creative tooling, right? So maybe it goes without saying that any goals that we're setting in the context of this hackathon should be relevant to that aim. And then finally, time bound goals. We don't want to set goals that we're going to be working on forever. Ideally, we're setting goals that have an end date that we can reassess. Because if you're looking to go zero to 100, the goal that's going to take you from zero to 20 might be distinct from the goal that would take you from 20 to 50 in 50 to 70 and 70 to 100. So the idea is that we're continually reflecting on and reassessing our goals so that they can be as targeted as possible to the stage that we're at in the development of our project or our personal habit or whatever it is that we're trying to work towards.
00:14:23.440 - 00:15:23.346, Speaker B: So this is a really good framework. It's kind of a classic one and it's going to be kind of like a measuring stick that we're going to use for the goals that we set today. So using this as a framework, I want to provide a couple of examples and we're actually going to work on these live together. So here's an example of a not so clear goal, right? I want to write more. Okay, great, but how are you going to measure that progress? How are you actually going to achieve that? So I'd like to take a couple of minutes now for you guys to actually rework this goal, right? Using the smart framework, come up with a more descriptive way to write this same goal that would be more effective in actually achieving it. So I'll leave a couple of minutes here and invite anybody to share your goal. I've already done this.
00:15:23.346 - 00:15:42.822, Speaker B: And so the next slide has my personal reworked goal. But curious to see what you guys come up with here. So just going to put a timer on for two minutes and see what we come up with. I was going to play some music, but I had to full screen my presentation.
00:15:42.886 - 00:15:54.818, Speaker C: So I can't, but let me see if I can pull it up here's.
00:15:54.934 - 00:16:03.600, Speaker B: All right, timers running. Lo fi beats to study to Here we go. Lo Fi beats to goal set two. I'm sorry.
00:16:14.890 - 00:18:21.120, Speaker C: It it.
00:18:23.970 - 00:19:23.940, Speaker B: All right. Start finishing up your goals. We're going to do this one more time, so no worries if you're not quite done yet, but would love to invite anybody who is willing to unmute share how you would rework this goal. With this smart framework. I think we can do, like, raised hands, right? Just one to two sentences. I can't see if anybody is raising hands or in the chat, but Luke, are you able to assist on this?
00:19:27.030 - 00:19:27.442, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:27.496 - 00:19:31.842, Speaker A: Derek. Derek's raising his hand right now if you want to come off and mute real quick.
00:19:31.976 - 00:19:32.322, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:32.376 - 00:19:34.742, Speaker B: Can you hear me? Loud and clear.
00:19:34.876 - 00:19:45.740, Speaker D: Okay, cool. So I would write it more specific, like, according to your guidelines, and say something like, I will have a 1 hour writing session every day at 10:00 A.m..
00:19:47.070 - 00:20:10.980, Speaker B: Solid. Yeah, that's great. Have a 1 hour writing session every day at 10:00 a.m.. So one thing that you might be able to improve to make that a little bit more descriptive is what is the intended outcome? Like, maybe in order to X, Y, and Z, I will perform a 1 hour writing session at this time. But I think that's really good.
00:20:11.510 - 00:20:13.986, Speaker D: Okay, that makes sense, because it would be more measurable that way, right?
00:20:14.008 - 00:20:15.714, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Yeah.
00:20:15.752 - 00:20:45.020, Speaker B: No, but that's solid. Thanks for sharing. Want to do one more of these? Oh, this was my example. In order to better process my thoughts and publish my first mirror article, I will spend ten minutes on creative writing every morning before starting work. That's just one example. Obviously, there's hundreds of ways you could rewrite this goal, but this is something that maybe I would work on over an eight week journey. So we're going to do this one more time.
00:20:45.020 - 00:20:54.000, Speaker B: I want to get in shape. How could we reconfigure this goal? So again, we'll do quick two minutes.
00:20:55.170 - 00:20:55.534, Speaker C: Actually.
00:20:55.572 - 00:23:21.050, Speaker B: Just kept the Lo Fi on this whole time. I'll just turn it up. But going to put another quick timer on one more minute. All right, we're coming up on two minutes, guys. Want to wrap up your goals, and one brave soul wants to raise your hand and share what you came up with. The floor is yours. There really are no wrong answers.
00:23:21.050 - 00:24:27.650, Speaker B: Going once, going twice we can vibe out to Lo Fi here all day. Last chance. Last chance. If someone wants to share. If not, I'll go ahead and share my interpretation. So here's how I rework this one. I'll stretch every morning before starting work, and we'll complete one round of exercise per day before dinner.
00:24:27.650 - 00:24:34.166, Speaker B: So again, this is keeping with that time bound, the idea of having the goals be really time bound and being really specific.
00:24:34.268 - 00:24:34.774, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:34.892 - 00:26:18.600, Speaker B: Thinking about, well, when actually would be the most effective time on a regular basis for me to complete this practice of exercising? What kind of exercise am I actually doing? For how long am I able to exercise? And again, this comes back to the idea of being able to continually reassess your goals because maybe this changes over time. Maybe you start out with a goal like this and then as you build your strength, maybe you are increasing the amount of time that you're spending working out or you're increasing the intensity of your workouts. And the same thing could be said of coding, of writing, of pretty much anything, I think, right, that if you'reassessing over time, as you make incremental progress toward the desired outcome, hopefully you're able to take on slightly more ambitious goals, right? The idea is that you're not starting with the super ambitious goal. So here's a couple of examples. Hope this was helpful in thinking through how to apply some of this stuff. And now I want to get to the potentially more exciting piece of this which is actually goal setting for the hackathon itself. So I would love if everybody now, based on this smart framework, based on some of what I've shared, based on what Derek shared, let's apply this to a goal for the hackathon itself, right? What is something that you actually hope to achieve over the coming days here? So an invitation to use this prompt of in order to do something.
00:26:18.600 - 00:27:33.854, Speaker B: In order to achieve something, I will do something that was this one here. In order to publish my Mirror article, I will do this writing practice. So what is it that you actually want to achieve here and what is the practice that will get you? There also an invitation to write a why statement like why do you actually feel called to contribute? Why do you feel called to be here? And to help build the next generation of onchain creative tooling. And then those two things ideally should line up, right? The goal that you're setting should line up with your reason for being here and both of them should align with those smart principles to some degree. So we'll take a few minutes for this and then would love to invite folks to share their goals for the hackathon and we can provide some feedback to each other on the goals that we're working on between now and the end of the hackathon. So, going to put on another timer. We'll give a couple extra minutes this time and yeah, we'll come back in a couple of minutes, four minutes this time.
00:27:33.854 - 00:28:01.240, Speaker B: Sorry. First, actually, before we do this, I would like to open for questions just in case I can clarify anything. Feel free to raise your hand if you have a question. If not, I'll go ahead and start the timer. Awesome.
00:28:08.780 - 00:28:34.730, Speaker C: You sam it.
00:28:40.860 - 00:32:50.330, Speaker B: Feel free to type this out, write it out with pen and paper if you prefer, however you prefer to actually get it in writing, it's up to you're. It one more minute on the clock. All right. Everybody could do your best to wrap up your goal. And no pressure, right? This is something that ideally, you're going to continue to iterate on, and we're all going to provide feedback to each other now, so no pressure. It's not perfect.
00:32:52.300 - 00:32:53.050, Speaker C: But.
00:32:55.100 - 00:33:30.470, Speaker B: That is time. So I was going to actually do breakout rooms, but I think we're a relatively small group, so we can actually just do this as an entire group. If anybody would like to kick things off by sharing the goal that you came up with, go ahead and raise your hand. The floor is yours. And I would encourage I'm here to provide feedback as well, but I would encourage you guys to actually provide feedback to each other. So once we get someone up here to share your goal, if anybody else wants to provide feedback, feel free to raise your hands as well.
00:33:45.430 - 00:33:45.954, Speaker C: All right?
00:33:45.992 - 00:33:50.710, Speaker B: We've got losing my ego. The floor is yours.
00:33:52.890 - 00:33:53.640, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:54.730 - 00:34:44.760, Speaker E: GM so my goal that I wrote for this was in order to finish coding the front end for our app, I will bucket my time into two hour work periods instead of just, like, working continuously because I know I'm more productive in, like, two hour buckets. And then for the second, like, the Dwight statement, I guess I feel called to contribute to next gen on chain tools because of my desire to contribute to open source communities and build for autonomy, I guess.
00:34:46.410 - 00:34:56.998, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And did you give your goal, like, the smart test? Would you mind actually dropping it in the chat so that we can all, for reference?
00:34:57.174 - 00:34:58.540, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah.
00:35:03.230 - 00:35:05.340, Speaker B: In order to finish the coding the front end?
00:35:05.970 - 00:35:06.382, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:06.436 - 00:35:17.520, Speaker B: I think that this is well, actually, I'd like to open this up. If anyone else would like to provide some feedback, you are more than welcome to do so.
00:35:23.670 - 00:35:24.226, Speaker C: Cool.
00:35:24.328 - 00:36:08.174, Speaker B: Well, from my perspective, this is a very good goal. I know that Nish has a bit of an advantage here because she's completed quite a few mochi journeys and set quite a few mochi goals in the past, but I think that this is a really good, really solid goal. It's pretty specific in terms of the desired outcome of finishing coding the front end of the app. That's something that's going to need to get done and the scope of it in order to finish coding the front end of the app before the end of the hackathon, maybe you could specify maybe in order to finish coding the front end with a day or two advance so that you can do testing or something like that. Maybe that's a consideration.
00:36:08.302 - 00:36:09.026, Speaker E: Oh, yeah.
00:36:09.128 - 00:36:36.218, Speaker B: But other than that, I think that this is a really clear measurable goal relevant. Time bound. Seems totally it's. Yeah, it's time bound. Sam, I saw your question is it time bound. I think that the specification of two hour work periods, that's a good nod to a time bound goal. But maybe having a clear deadline of what I had mentioned before.
00:36:36.218 - 00:37:01.166, Speaker B: Maybe you want to finish coding the front end with a day or two of advance so that you have time to prepare a presentation, do some testing, et cetera. But other than that I think this is a really good actionable goal. So nice work. Derek, I saw you had your hand up as well. Would you like to share what you wrote?
00:37:01.358 - 00:37:43.630, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So I'm just know this is my first hackathon and there's a mean I might not get anything actually published but I'm just here to my my goal is in order to learn as much as I can during this hackathon, I will participate in all the presentations and watch all the videos. Also I'll work on building something new 4 hours tonight and 8 hours tomorrow which is Saturday and Sunday I will rewrite a long term goal which will last two weeks because I really want to take what I learned here and run with it. So that's my goal.
00:37:44.210 - 00:38:12.198, Speaker B: Nice. So it almost feels like your goal is over the next few days to get as much as you can out of this initial experience so that you're more prepared come Sunday to set a more because it sounds like you had different goals for today versus tomorrow versus for Sunday with the intention of getting to the point where you maybe can set a more clear goal for moving forward. Is that right?
00:38:12.364 - 00:38:26.222, Speaker D: Exactly. Yeah, I definitely want to take what I learned here and build something. But set a goal to build something to get it published is maybe a little unrealistic. Like I said, I'm here to learn first hackathon. So yeah, what you said sums it up pretty well.
00:38:26.276 - 00:38:27.374, Speaker C: Yeah. Cool.
00:38:27.412 - 00:39:02.680, Speaker B: Well, shout out to you for being here. Hope it's a positive first hackathon experience. One thing I would say right, just on the attainable front, 8 hours is quite a long time and as is 4 hours. So maybe would say like for at least 2 hours I will show up and work on something so that you're again setting yourself up to over deliver on your own expectations. But I think otherwise you seem to be thinking about this in a really healthy way.
00:39:03.450 - 00:39:03.910, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:39:03.980 - 00:39:04.358, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:39:04.444 - 00:39:04.806, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:39:04.828 - 00:39:19.600, Speaker D: I don't like the idea actually. I'm going to steal losing my ego's idea and split it up. So if it's not 8 hours maybe it'll definitely be pieces buckets because 8 hours is a long time to be sitting working on something. But splitting it up is a great idea for sure.
00:39:19.970 - 00:39:23.360, Speaker B: Does anyone else have any feedback or any thoughts they want to share.
00:39:25.570 - 00:39:25.886, Speaker C: Or.
00:39:25.908 - 00:39:50.726, Speaker B: A goal that you want to share? I guess? Floor is open, we're coming up on time but we have a few more minutes. Cool. Well, I am going to. Oh, Sam Wise, it said. Curious to know what Derek's project is. Derek, are you open to share a little bit about what you're planning to work on?
00:39:50.908 - 00:40:11.440, Speaker D: Yeah, I came in really open minded, looking to really focused on building a tool for DAOs to use, like a blanket tool that any dow can use for creating a structure and creating their organization. The more I get into it.
00:40:13.810 - 00:40:14.126, Speaker C: I.
00:40:14.148 - 00:40:29.250, Speaker D: See that the hackathon is really focused on NFTs and music, so I actually might go in another direction. But definitely my long term goal. I want to create dow tools that DAOs can use to create structure in the organization.
00:40:30.550 - 00:40:42.780, Speaker B: Awesome. Definitely would love to tap in with you beyond the scope of this meeting because that's a lot of what I'm doing and what we're doing at Mochi, losing my ego. Would you like to share a little bit about your project?
00:40:56.050 - 00:41:45.360, Speaker E: Yeah, we're focusing on music, NFT and collective curation, kind of. We found that there is a gap in the market currently with music platforms in the web3 space where bringing your own contract isn't fully supported. And so that's something we're working on, the ability for a collective or group of like minded individuals to decide to join essentially like an allow list together and curate specific pieces that they have minted wherever they wanted and to display them together. So that's kind of our idea.
00:41:46.690 - 00:42:18.418, Speaker B: Nice. That's really cool. I'm excited to see what comes of both of your projects and everyone else in here as well. We are coming up, like, we have just a couple of minutes left, so I want to wrap this up, but you're all invited to track these goals using Mochi if you'd like to. Like I mentioned before, we have a system where this is all kind of the daily reporting, the reflection. This is all automated with our system. It integrates with discord.
00:42:18.418 - 00:43:04.306, Speaker B: So we'd love to invite anybody who's interested to join us in our Discord and complete track your goals with the Mochi journey. We're offering extra token rewards and we're going to do a limited edition POAP as well for those who are interested. So, Luke, actually, would you mind dropping that invite link here? I'm not able to open the chat right now, but I know I'd put it in there earlier. Thank you. And for those who are interested to learn more about Mochi and hang out and just chat with us, definitely tap in with us here. Bond with Mochi is our Twitter. Again, we're tracking personal development goals in our Discord all day, every day.
00:43:04.306 - 00:43:26.510, Speaker B: Not all day, every day, really. It's more like a couple of minutes every day. But we'd love to see some of you all in there and we'd love to chat more with some of you all outside of the hackathon. But again, thank you so much to everyone for being here. Wishing everyone the best of. Luck in the coming days. And this is just a call to dream big.
00:43:26.510 - 00:43:53.220, Speaker B: Start small, stick together with your teams and reflect on what you're doing, right? Take time to reflect on what you're doing and to be critical about the goals that power the outcomes you're looking to achieve here. So thank you guys so much. Again, my name is Alec, and we are at time. If we have a couple minutes for questions, I'm happy to take them, but I'm not sure that we do.
00:43:54.230 - 00:44:12.700, Speaker A: Thanks for an incredible presentation there, Alec. I know everyone benefited from that. We will be ending the session here. We do have one more session coming up right at the top of the hour, so head on over there and enjoy that. But, Alex, thank you so much for I really, really think that a lot of people got some value out of this today.
00:44:13.230 - 00:44:14.140, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:44:14.510 - 00:44:16.540, Speaker A: Cheers. Take care, everyone.
00:44:17.230 - 00:44:17.990, Speaker C: Happy Friday.
