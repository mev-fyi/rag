00:00:05.770 - 00:00:33.602, Speaker A: All right, let's get started. I'm Jason Goldberg, founder and CEO of airstack. And we have my co founder Sarvesh here. And we're going to walk you through the airstack platform in 20 minutes. So, very simple. Top level on airstack is we enable web three composability. We're the easiest way to grab any type of on chain transaction or data from across the ethereum ecosystem and to plug it into your applications.
00:00:33.602 - 00:01:03.070, Speaker A: And so if you look at this query, for instance, that I have here, you'll see how you can use our AI engine a second to write queries. But this is a pretty complex query. This is asking, give me the wallet, address and the ENS of holders of this NFT collection with a very specific NFT collection. Show the NFT image and medium sized return. The token ID and the name from metadata. Also show their Farcaster and lens if they have one, in Xmtp. So we are going to just plug this into the airstack AI.
00:01:03.070 - 00:01:48.586, Speaker A: And so let's go here into the airstack studio. I'm just going to copy paste this. And our AI engine actually helps you learn how to write the queries in airstack. So the airstack AI is trained on all of our APIs and it'll write the GraphQL query for you and then also deliver the response. You can, of course, add more variables to your query and write queries directly which Starvesh is going to show you. But what we did here is in a matter of milliseconds we have the AI has written a very complex query of here's, a very specific NFT collection. Give me all the holders that Mt collection, give me the images for the assets in that NFT collection, which we resize at airstack for you with our CDN.
00:01:48.586 - 00:02:33.754, Speaker A: Give me all the details of the holders, including their lens or forecaster ID, if they have one and whether they have Xmtp or not. So really quickly, just to show you, these are all the APIs that we have at airstack or all the data points that you can bring back into your queries and response. And you can do all this in a single query and response. So you don't have to do, say, ping this API and then this API and this API. You can literally just do one API call, get back all this data. So I'll show you two more queries with the AI and then Saravesh is going to construct some manually and show you the details about the APIs work. But way to think about it is with airstack you have every ERC, 27, 20, 111, 55 on ethereum and polygon within seconds of the transaction.
00:02:33.754 - 00:03:26.606, Speaker A: Finalizing, you have, ERC, six, five, one. If you're familiar with token bound accounts, 6551, airstack is the only indexer of 6551 you can index up and down the tree. You can even start off with an NFT that say, several layers below in the tree and say, who's the owner of it, get the EO address of it. So we're also very strong in the areas of social and identity. So Lens Farcaster domains ENS both on chain and off chain ENS, as well as the only way that you can find out if someone has Xmtp. So a lot of apps, specifically almost every major Lens app using airstack to resolve what are basically people's ENS addresses to their FARC sorry, to their Lens name, to their zero x, so that the messages from Xmtb get through and you don't need to know someone's zero X address. Also, we do a lot with NFT market data as well.
00:03:26.606 - 00:04:19.258, Speaker A: Let me just show you two more queries really quick in the airstack studio, and the service will construct some from scratch. So I'm going to say, for instance, to show you how complex you can do these composability, I'm going to do a query that says show all attendees of ECC Six, which was a few weeks ago in Paris, and their Web Three Socials and Xmtp. And the AI is going to write this query for us. This is actually a really complex query. The ECC poop is on the Gnosis chain. You have web three socials Lens is on Polygon, Farcasters on Optimism and off chain and Farcaster hubs. Xmtp is off chain data and the AI is able to write the query and airstack is able to give you back that response all in the same response JSON file.
00:04:19.258 - 00:04:51.834, Speaker A: Where you see here's one user, their lens name, their lens handle. They have XMT and P enabled. This person has a lens and a forecaster. And so you can get all this back in your application very easily. Last one I'll show you is I can also say show all followers of betashhop. This is me betashop Lens, and if they have Xmtp and airstack will go and grab my followers. It can be from Lens, can be from Farcaster, can be both.
00:04:51.834 - 00:05:20.106, Speaker A: So you can build interoperable applications and also see right away whether the user is messageable through Xmtp. I'm going to find out whether my name is betashop nine, sorry, on Lens. So we'll generate that again. And so here we have getting all the followers of betashop nine Lens. They have XM to be enabled. And here you go. So here's all my followers and you can see this person has X on TB enabled.
00:05:20.106 - 00:05:59.734, Speaker A: You can also see their profile name, et cetera. Last thing I'll show you in my hand to Sarvesh is we have very robust documentation. We have everything from how to do combinations. So like show me everyone who, let's say, attended this event and this event or has this NFT and this NFT tokens in common. So let's say, do these two users have both owned this token, as I mentioned, 6551 Xmtp Lens, Farcaster Social follows Poop resolving identities and you can also build very robust recommendation engines with airstack as well. Last thing is we actually launched today with Xmtp, a number of spam filters. This is all about kind of proof of personhood.
00:05:59.734 - 00:06:29.700, Speaker A: It's like knowing, let's say you follow this person on forecast or a lens, so the message should get through into your primary inbox. Or we know this is a real person because they attended an in person event. Or the high probability that you know this person, you both have attended multiple events together, or maybe both have high value NFTs together versus the inverse. This person looks like a likely spammer. So let's avoid them. So you can see all this in our docs and I'm going to hand to Sarbash, who's going to walk you through the details of how to build queries in airstack more than I could in the five minute little razzle dazzle I just did. Go ahead.
00:06:29.700 - 00:06:32.600, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:06:32.970 - 00:06:56.766, Speaker B: Okay, let's get into it. Okay, so we'll start with the Explorer. As you can see, we have many APIs here. I'll start with a simple one, which is Token balances. So in this API you can ask about, you can start from a token address or you can start from a wallet. So from the token address you will get the holders of a token and from the wallet you will find all the balances. Right, so I'll build a simple query around it.
00:06:56.766 - 00:07:47.384, Speaker B: So I'll select the amount and token ID token type, right? And I'll take the address of the wallet right now in the filter, I'll start with an ENS name. So I'll put my name, yeah, and I'll run this query. I'll get all the balances that I have right now in the same query. If I see like, I have NFTs and I want to know the images of the NFDS, then I can select the token NFDS. I can go to content value, I can select different sizes of the images. I can run the query again when I get all the different size of images. I can also add more details to the same query.
00:07:47.384 - 00:08:33.354, Speaker B: So I can add like, the social profiles, so I can select the DAP name and the profile name and I can run the same query. So in one query I'm asking the socials as well, along with the balances. Now, in terms of input, like, you can start with the ENS and you can also start with a lens profile. So if you have a lens profile, you can put a lens handle here and you still get the same response. And if you have a forecaster name, then you can put that too. Yeah, and you get the same response. So there are multiple ways to use this API.
00:08:33.354 - 00:09:05.240, Speaker B: The token balances. You can build like use cases like token gating around it. The next thing that I want to showcase is around socials, if you want to know about the social profile of a wallet. So here we have identity as an input. So you can start with, again, an ENS name or a Lens profile or a forecaster name. You can select fields that you are interested in. I'll select a couple of them, I'll select the DAP name, followers count, following count and the profile name.
00:09:05.240 - 00:09:36.078, Speaker B: So this query gives me like how many followers I have, how many people I follow. Now in the same query, if I want I can add the list of the followers so I can select the followers and I can add details about the follower. So I'll select the follower address and I want to know, let's say, their social profile so I can select the name and the DAP.
00:09:36.174 - 00:09:36.820, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:39.790 - 00:10:37.600, Speaker B: So in the one query I'm able to fetch all the followers for this identity. So this will give me followers across the protocols and I'm able to ask the social profiles they have. If I want, I can add more details to it so I can select the Xmtb if they have Xmtb. So if I have to build an app where I want to reach out to the followers and I want to use Xmtp protocol, I can use this query. Okay, next I want to show about the Poops. So I want to know what event particular identity attended so I can start again with any NS name and I can select the fields. So I will select some details about the event so the description of the event, the country where it happened, I can select the image for the event that was used in the Poops event name.
00:10:37.600 - 00:11:40.392, Speaker B: Yeah, so I can run this query so you can see like I attended these events and I able to fetch data around it if I have to ask more details about the people who attended. Right, so you can go again in the addresses and you can ask about their primary domain so all the data is connected with the wallet address so you can go deeper and ask more questions around it. The next I'll cover so we also have the token NFDS. In the token NFDS you can go very detailed about the metadata and you can query based on the metadata like if you want to find certain NFDS with the attributes given attributes. So you want BYC collection and I want all the images, all the NFDS which has background blue so you can build using this attribute. So you'll go here and you can select the trade type as the background color and you will select the value.
00:11:40.446 - 00:11:41.576, Speaker A: As blue so you will be able.
00:11:41.598 - 00:12:15.888, Speaker B: To run those complex filters. Similarly you have tokens and the balances too. Yeah, if you are interested into NFT sales data then you start with the NFT sales transaction API. You can filter based on the token addresses in the token ID and you can query all the sales data it's coming from OpenSea, Blur, looksrar and wearable. So four marketplaces, you can get all the data now. So all of these are GraphQL APIs and you can use AI or you can manually build the query. And once you have the query, there are multiple ways to use it.
00:12:15.888 - 00:12:38.600, Speaker B: The one way is you can hit our GraphQL endpoint and put the query and you'll get the response. We also have like, SDKs. So if you're building a front end application, you can use React SDK. If you are building a backend system, then you can use Node JS or Python SDK. We have a detailed examples on the GitHub. How do we use this SDK for all three languages?
00:12:41.180 - 00:13:29.864, Speaker A: Yeah, so just to show everyone real quick, we have an airstack Explorer, which is a good example of how you can build very robust GUIs on top of the airstack APIs without any backend at all. So this is a front end right on top of the airstack. Actually, I'll use David and this is a live API call. Did I spell your name right? D-A-W-F-I lens There you go. So there's a microphone in the way. That's just a live API call. And you have David's, ERC, 720 Ones poops all in one view.
00:13:29.864 - 00:14:02.804, Speaker A: You have the social profile, including all the followers. I can click in here, for example, and see everyone that David is following on Farcaster, including whether they have Xmtb lens. I can also drill down on them and see how many of them also have lens. Actually, who he's following on both Farcaster and Lens. And again, this is just live. Like just ping our APIs in real time and then can even click out and just get the API for that, which opens up the studio where we just were a second ago. So it's really just that easy to build all sorts of front ends on top of this.
00:14:02.804 - 00:14:41.224, Speaker A: You can use the SDKs or you can use the APIs directly, as Sarbas was saying. Any questions? I think we were pretty fast and efficient. Anyone? All right, we have a Telegram group for Dev chat. You can get your free API key there. And our team is there twenty four seven to ask any if you have any questions, if you stop by our table, you can scan the QR code to get to our Telegram group and let us know. We'd love to help you build some amazing stuff this weekend, so let us know. Thank you.
00:14:41.224 - 00:14:41.700, Speaker A: Bye.
