00:00:00.490 - 00:00:28.774, Speaker A: I believe everyone is here and Giorgio's actually prepared extensively a set of questions, so props to that. As well as David from Synthetics also prepared some notes that we shared in the agenda, as well as some highlights on their consideration with L2 implementation. So all of this can be found in the agenda. So, Giorgios. Go ahead.
00:00:28.972 - 00:00:29.478, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:29.564 - 00:00:39.800, Speaker C: So, again, KL, see you again. It would be nice to get a quick intro from our panelists, starting with Barry, maybe. Is Barry around?
00:00:40.330 - 00:00:57.360, Speaker B: Yeah. Hey, Jordan. I'm here. Yeah. So I'm Barry. I did a lot of work on L2 stuff and I have done some work on the Miva stuff, the Minor Extractable Value Auctions. So I'm excited to chat with kind of more DeFi focused people and get their opinions on that.
00:00:57.730 - 00:00:59.310, Speaker C: Nice, Stanley.
00:01:00.850 - 00:01:38.220, Speaker D: Everyone, I'm Stani Kulichov. I'm the founder of Avi Protocol, which is an interest rate market on Ethereum L One and now in Maddox as well. I've been building financial, decentralized financial applications for a few years now, and starting with ETH Len back a few years ago, mainly I'm pretty much involved in the products side and also building incentive models and also kind of like helping on the risk assessment side and creating a risk framework and yeah, that's about it.
00:01:39.790 - 00:01:40.442, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:01:40.496 - 00:02:22.620, Speaker E: And David, everyone, I'm David, so I joined Synthetics as a core contributor earlier this year. I first got involved with their project going back to 2018 when they were called Haven, so they since rebranded. I was the founder of a smart contract auditing company called Blocktracks, and then after that, I ended up working on a database company, so it wasn't necessarily in crypto. And then very excited to be back in DFI. So looking forward to going over kind of we're building a lot on optimism on L2. So very excited to share with some of the learnings challenges and stuff we're really excited about as we move forward.
00:02:23.790 - 00:02:44.830, Speaker C: Thank you very much. So kind of to kickstart the discussion, it would be nice to hear from Stani and David some things about what kinds of mev do major DeFi platforms expose today? I imagine that both Ave and Synthetics have some things to say on that, maybe starting with Stani.
00:02:45.190 - 00:03:40.494, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. Well, two kind of occasions, I would say, usually in occasional liquidations, for example. So obviously, Protocol, we have a collateralization system, so when you deposit into the protocol, then you can borrow value out of the protocol against your collateral. And to keep that collateral position, you might need to refill depending how the market moves. So if it moves substantially, the market decreases, you might have to refill the collateral or it might get liquidated. And how the liquidation network works in Ave Protocol and pretty much across the whole DeFi ecosystem is that there's certain type of incentives available for the liquidators. So whoever actually takes that position and replaces the collateral with the borrowed funds will also get a margin for that particular transaction.
00:03:40.494 - 00:05:13.460, Speaker D: Now, what's interesting here is that the liquidators that are in Aave are also liquidating other positions in other protocols as well, depending on the incentives. And because it's an open network, everyone is kind of like a finding on getting that particular incentive model. And because some of the assets are very volatile in the sense as crypto native by itself, what happens is that the incentives are quite wide in their spread, for example, and we have a fixed incentive system to kind of ensure that when the market decreases substantially, we have enough liquidators coming and actually fighting to get that jersey incentive. This is kind of like an interesting part, because many of the liquidations actually happens with flash loans, which practically means that you might not need upfront capital to do certain type of liquidation, but you can actually flash borrow from the protocol, make the liquidation, don't use any capital, and just collect the spread. And this is where the mev actually has its own risk, I would say. And in general, when it comes to flash loans, so our protocol is a flash loan protocol. So you can not just borrow against the collateral, but you can borrow for one particular transaction with subtransactions doing, for example, Arbitrage, let's say that you borrow from Ave, you buy an asset in market one market, let's say, uniswap, and you sell it in another market, kyber, for example.
00:05:13.460 - 00:05:25.780, Speaker D: And this is also kind of like opportunity where the value can be extracted by the miners. So at least those two cases are something that is very familiar to us.
00:05:28.790 - 00:06:35.494, Speaker E: David yeah, so if you're familiar with synthetics at all, I mean, one of the biggest challenges any DeFi protocol faces is getting liquidity in the system. And so the way we've designed our liquidity system is SNX stakers come on to the platform, they stake their SNX and then they mint SUSD, which is kind of the entry point into the Synths world on Synthetics and so on Synthetix, we support a number of different Synthetic assets, anything from synthetic ETH and Synthetic bitcoin to Synthetic currencies. We have a synthetic oil and there's commodities, and now we've added equities, such as synthetic Tesla and Coinbase, et cetera. And so how the liquidity for those assets gets created is through the stakers. And we have this thing called the debt pool. So when people stake, debt gets created in the system, and when traders come on and they trade, let's say you wanted to go from S ETH to S Bitcoin, or I guess lately you'd probably want to go from SBTC to S ETH, which is pretty exciting. You would essentially be trading against the debt pool, right? There is no counterparty.
00:06:35.494 - 00:07:49.410, Speaker E: You're trading peer to contract, right? And in that sense, the risk for front running, the risk for people taking advantage of price discrepancies in the price oracles and stuff like that, the risk is borne by the stakers. So it's a little bit of a unique problem that's specific to synthetics. Normally, if you were trading on something like Uniswap, the trader would be at risk for front running and other mev risk areas. So it's a bit different for us. And so because of that, we've had to deal with several challenges around the user experience. So this is a big kind of ongoing trade off between how do you really nail the user experience, especially for us as people come on to do trading with different trading strategies, with security and making sure that the stakers and the people providing liquidity to the system aren't getting taken advantage of and so on. L One, we had to introduce this thing called fee reclamation, which it has obviously the benefit of not being front runnable because when you make a trade, you basically have to wait six minutes for the trade to settle.
00:07:49.410 - 00:09:15.950, Speaker E: And when you wait six minutes, we basically are looking for price changes during that period and we'll take those into account depending on the price that you get. So the point there is that hurts from the UX, like no trader really wants to wait six minutes for the trade to settle and then also for composability, like if we wanted to integrate with Ave, it becomes challenging because of that waiting period. And as we look to move to L2, we're trying to do everything we can to get rid of fee reclamation and feel confident that our system is not and the stakers aren't exposed to unnecessary risk. So a couple of the differences between L One and L2 is on L2, so we're building on top of optimism and there's no mem pool on optimism. And so because of that, that relieves one attack vector where people could look at the transactions coming in the queue and they can basically say, I'm going to pay a higher gas price and I'm going to basically have my transaction execute before this. And so the transactions are just going directly into the sequencer on L2, which is obviously there's benefits to that. The cons of that is that currently optimism is running the sequencer and so there's some centralization aspect to it in today's state.
00:09:15.950 - 00:10:11.786, Speaker E: And so there's been a lot of discussion, like Carl just gave a presentation on meva and then there's conversation from chainlink around Fair sequencing and stuff like that. And those mechanisms are designed to help bring more decentralization to the sequencer, not being able to order transactions right, because optimism has every reason not to shoot themselves in the foot in terms of messing with the order of transactions. But once the plan is to move optimism away from running the sequencer, to bring more decentralization where anyone could run the sequencer. But when that happens, we have to make sure that they can't just order the transactions the way that they want, therefore affecting the system. So that's one kind of attack vector thing we're working with. The other area is around price Oracle latency. And this specifically, again, is a huge problem for synthetics because of the way the debt pool, like I explained, with the liquidity is structured.
00:10:11.786 - 00:10:57.754, Speaker E: And so with that, some of the things we're doing is we are working with chainlink to try to get the deviation threshold down. So the way that that works is let's say the deviation threshold for a chain link price Oracle is 0.3%, right? That means that when there's a move in price that's sorry, not 30 bips, right? So I guess that would be like your .3%. And so if there's a move above that, it causes the price Oracle to update the price. Right? And so you want that to be as low as possible because that means you'll get more frequent price updates in the sense that there's price movement. So we're working to get those down. Another thing we're doing is we have a heartbeat.
00:10:57.754 - 00:11:44.638, Speaker E: The heartbeat is less relevant as far as this stuff goes, but the heartbeat is like, if the price hasn't gone above that threshold, there needs to be something that triggers a new price. And so the lower the heartbeat is, the better. The problem is that it gets expensive, right, if it's pretty low. So we're aiming for like a 1 hour heartbeat and stuff like that. And then I would say the last thing to kind of keep in mind there that's been something we're trying to do is so we're launching with higher fees than we'd like to have because higher fees obviously is not ideal. Again, this is this trade off between user experience for the traders and everything, but it does bring more security. For example, we're launching with like 75 bips, which is a zero point 75% structure, at least that's what we're thinking.
00:11:44.638 - 00:12:03.714, Speaker E: And obviously that helps make it so front running is not even worth it for people. But our goal is to bring that down to like 30 bips over time. So those are some other things and then I guess, yeah, just a fair amount of talking.
00:12:03.912 - 00:12:35.680, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you very much. That was very extensive. I think that people will kind of look back at this kind of segment as how mev and synthetics interact with each other. On the thing that you just said about optimism, just to ask a question by, what do you think about the mev auction? So, yes, you were very early into designing the mechanism. I earlier said some things about not liking them so much. So I wonder what your thoughts are on mev auctions and how they will define kind of the player to block producer election game.
00:12:36.530 - 00:13:00.502, Speaker B: Oh, fun. Okay. Yeah. So, okay, let me just give a little quick introduction to it. So I think that mev is a serious problem and we should do all we can to remove as much mev as possible, but we should also try and mitigate the problem of mev. So I see mev extractable value auctions as a way of mitigation. So that's kind of what I think.
00:13:00.502 - 00:13:02.920, Speaker B: Georgios, what are your concerns about it?
00:13:03.690 - 00:13:16.060, Speaker C: Basically that it just doesn't solve much in a way. You just use it to elect your sequencer and then yes, the sequencer of course receives all the mev and then what?
00:13:16.750 - 00:13:41.540, Speaker B: Okay, so theoretically, because you have this auction to elect the sequencer, the value that the profit that they're making, the majority of that profit should be destroyed or else donated to some public goods. The idea is that although mev still exists in the system, what you're doing is you're capturing some subset of it, and when you're doing that, you're kind of reducing the severity of it. Does that make sense?
00:13:43.590 - 00:14:01.350, Speaker C: To some extent, although it still seems to me that having some form of more low level randomization scheme or separation between execution and ordering would be a more robust solution. But it seems like that maybe these two are complementary.
00:14:02.170 - 00:14:12.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we should have both. I mean, we can dig into this more, but I've also had some thoughts about the random ordering, but I'm not sure if that's the direction you want to take it in the panel.
00:14:16.610 - 00:14:33.860, Speaker C: I think everybody would be interesting in hearing how random ordering and kind of like these mechanisms interact or will affect rather the rest of the DFI ecosystem on L2. So maybe kind of worth scoping down your thoughts into this.
00:14:34.790 - 00:15:13.610, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Yeah. Okay, so you do random ordering where the block producer orders the transactions before they know what the transactions are. But there are certain situations where this will be really bad. Right. For example, if someone on synthetics or Ave is getting liquidated, and let's say the reward for that is like 100 E, then people are incentivized to create like 100 E worth of transactions and just randomly put those out there on the off chance that they will be the first one. It turns it into this kind of lottery situation where you get this burst of transactions appearing because people know that, oh, I probably won't get there, but if I do, it's like winning the lottery.
00:15:13.610 - 00:15:57.920, Speaker B: So that's for me is one concern of the random ordering. I think someone raised that earlier during Ellie's talk, but I'm not sure if it really got described correctly. So I think that the solution that I prefer is actually the time lock approach. So basically what you do is you say, okay, here's my order, I'm going to place this order and it's going to be processed after some time delay. And the reason you have to use a time lock is because you don't want people to be able to place orders and then say that okay, I'm not actually going to reveal that order. Yeah. So I think it's important to do both, but I'm skeptical about the random ordering approach, but I know other people have other opinions on that I'd be interested to hear.
00:16:00.370 - 00:16:50.574, Speaker E: Got it. It's interesting you mentioned kind of the liquidations use case in terms of our roadmap. I don't know if you can pull up the second slide that I had, but this definitely becomes relevant if you think about what we'll be rolling out. So currently we just have Staking on l two on main net, we'll be rolling out exchanging next, and then after that, shorts shorting since and then Futures, right? And Futures. The way we're designing the system is sort of like perpetuals where you can specify leverage. And so once you start to specify five times leverage on a position, the liquidations become somewhat tricky. I think there is like a potential attack vector, kind of like Barry was saying there.
00:16:50.574 - 00:16:54.740, Speaker E: So I think that's a pretty interesting thing. I'd like to give more thought to.
00:16:59.470 - 00:17:04.140, Speaker D: One thing I'm thinking as well, kind of like one solution will be.
00:17:06.430 - 00:17:06.758, Speaker B: It'S.
00:17:06.774 - 00:17:50.460, Speaker D: Not an optimal solution because in one way and theoretically is that you can create governance based permissions for liquidators. So practically certain type of liquidators can liquidate. And that could be one option that you have this permissionless ability. That will be one way. But then again, we're going against the permissionless nature of the blockchains and DeFi itself. But to some extent, that could be one way to do it, especially if you use governance for this kind of solution. That might be pretty interesting.
00:17:51.950 - 00:18:16.580, Speaker E: Another thing Chainlinks talked about in their Fair sequencing, stuff that they've been thinking about is basically encrypting the transactions so that the content, the transaction content, is only revealed after the ordering has been agreed on. So that's another kind of interesting thing. I don't know that much necessarily about it, but I know that's something they've been trying to figure out.
00:18:17.830 - 00:18:38.060, Speaker B: Yeah. So my concern with this approach is that what you have to do is you have to make sure that people are forced to reveal their order. Because otherwise what I can do is I can make potential orders and then refuse to reveal them if it's going to lose me money. So, yeah, that's my thinking there. There has to be some mechanism to force the reveal of the order.
00:18:42.350 - 00:19:28.464, Speaker C: I agree with that critique. Yeah, exactly. It's a free option, maybe moving forward because we're kind of running on time when evaluating a L2 protocol. Because Stanny, you have deployed yourselves on Matic and I don't know what the rest of your plans are. And David, like, you've chosen optimism. I wonder, do you take mev mitigation or the strategy of the project around mev into account? Does it matter what's the deal? Does mev matter for you? Or is it just an extra nice.
00:19:28.502 - 00:20:52.280, Speaker D: To have maybe started in personally and kind of like I would say that it matters quite a lot because it's definitely like an issue. But when it comes to deployments of a protocol in different, let's say, side chains layer L2s and other maybe blockchains, what we usually follow is pretty much like what the community wants to do. It's not the biggest decisive thing, but also when we deploy contracts into other networks, it's part of the kind of like a technicality it's that how the functioning will be. And it's not just the mev, but there's other kind of things like how easy it is to deploy contracts, for example, I mean, whether there's EVM compatibility and so forth. So it plays some factor. But then again, I somehow see the space now a bit saturated with different kinds of chains and many of the l Two solutions are not super ripe yet. I mean, it's still kind of like very early, but definitely that would be something that affects quite a lot, especially if you see more and more issues related to mev and incur.
00:20:52.280 - 00:21:36.780, Speaker D: But I guess for us the most kind of like a key part where it might happen is the liquidations. And as long as most of the liquidations work, it's not a problem. But the kind of risk is that if kind of the liquidators incentives are lost and in that sense there's less and less liquidators coming into the spot when actually you need them the most. So that's kind of like the problematic part, I would say. But yeah, it's a consideration. But still, it's just part of the tech we're looking and assessing when we deploy the protocols.
00:21:40.000 - 00:22:35.212, Speaker E: Yeah, I would just say I think it's definitely a consideration. I think if I kind of think about why did we choose optimism in the first place. So the way we kind of looked at it was how do we mitigate risk as a whole? So obviously maybe mev falls into one category in that. But I think the biggest thing for us was not having to maintain two code, right, using our existing solidity code. And then the way that optimism has been approaching their OVM is they're trying to leverage as much as possible from the EVM and what exists and what's super secure today. And so, for example, I think their compiler is like a 200 line diff or something like that, right? So those were all considerations we were taking into account. And then I think we just really like their team and we're really excited about working with them.
00:22:35.212 - 00:23:30.800, Speaker E: At the same time we want to be at the bleeding edge. And so I think one question we've been getting a lot is what's our overall l Two strategy? So we love the optimism team, we love what they're doing. I think as things continue to change, we're certainly excited about just being on l Two in general and making sure that we're at the forefront of the way the community is moving. And then again, it's just a lot of it's social too, right? Where is the liquidity going to be is something we've been thinking about and trying to figure out. And so to me, all those things kind of went into our initial our main decision and then, yeah, obviously risk mitigation and this type of stuff is an important factor as well. But I think the other stuff, maybe even not to say this isn't important or anything, it seems like those other things were kind of the things that were know our decision.
00:23:33.380 - 00:23:47.430, Speaker C: Nice. Thank you very much, David and Stani and Barry. I think that at this point we're quite time, so I think we can wrap it up here. Thank you very much, everyone, tina Kartik and the rest and we'll see you around.
00:23:50.860 - 00:24:40.164, Speaker A: Thank you, Georgia. Thank you everyone on this panel and any, I guess summary and next step for open questions from Justin or Anne, Phil, Kartik, anyone who's on this call. As we are planning our next Mev Roast, a mega event that will focus a lot more on these kind of microstructure questions and also things that we touched on but didn't dive into, such as fairness debate extraction versus mitigation. We will do a more systematic deep dive into those. But once you see if there's any remaining open questions that anyone wants to suggest as well or takeaways Justin our.
00:24:40.202 - 00:25:26.740, Speaker F: Rosemaster, I don't have any specific mean. I'm glad I've been learning know flashboards for the last week or two and I'm sure I'll have more questions as I do a more deep dive. But in general, I'd say that I'm very impressed with some of the principles that Flashbot has taken around decentralization, around ethics, around open sourcing, around all this good stuff, eliminating the forest, et cetera, et cetera. I still think there's a lot of work on the actual product, but I think the cultural foundations are extremely strong, which is fantastic.
00:25:29.640 - 00:25:30.630, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:25:31.400 - 00:26:17.340, Speaker G: Awesome. Well, I want to thank as we wrap this up, I want to thank Justin for being our roastmaster and Tina for coordinating this event and the Flashbots team for just making sure that all these amazing conversations happen today. So I personally got to learn a lot of new things and a lot of interesting topics and seems like just from the conversation today, there's already enough content for comes up for the next roast in June. So hopefully everybody on the chat on the panel also got to participate in a lot of interesting discussions and got some new insights out of this. So I want to thank everybody here, from our panelists to everybody watched, 100 plus of you and just everybody who participated and engaged with all of our speakers.
