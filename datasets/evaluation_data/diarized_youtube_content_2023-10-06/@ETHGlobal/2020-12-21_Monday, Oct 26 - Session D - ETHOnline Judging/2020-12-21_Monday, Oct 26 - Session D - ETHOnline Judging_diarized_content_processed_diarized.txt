00:00:00.330 - 00:00:39.740, Speaker A: You. Okay. Like I said, this is day three of our judging for ETH Online. To sort of give everyone a sense of the scale of this, which we were just talking about, there's over 700 hackers have joined, and we had over 1000 applications come in, and the current hackers are from 65 countries across 19 time zones. We've had a ton of great projects, and we topped out at about 175 projects submitted. So that's what's being judged over all of these days. I'll run quickly through the format for everyone.
00:00:39.740 - 00:01:34.662, Speaker A: As everyone knows, each team will have a four minute, no longer than four minutes video demo, which will start at the start of each team's judging session, after which there's a four minute Q and A. And then about halfway through this set, we have about 16 teams we're going to do today. So around team eight or nine, we're going to do a ten minute break and then return to just discuss, for everyone's benefit, the broad criteria that we have asked the judges to apply. There's a technicality criteria, originality, the practicality of the hack. They give consideration to the UI, UX and the DX. And then there's that wow factor. If it's just a cool idea or something else that really catches their stress.
00:01:34.662 - 00:02:07.426, Speaker A: If you've gone to an East Global event, we really stress. Of course, there's a competitive aspect to it, but this really isn't at its core a hardcore competition because we really emphasize the experience of everyone here. We hope people are here to learn, and they've learned a lot, even for this particular judging session. The goal here isn't necessarily to make the hack a business. We're not focused on cultivating that that's up for the hackers themselves. But you should take this opportunity. It's not just judging.
00:02:07.426 - 00:02:47.300, Speaker A: It's to get some good feedback. This is a rare opportunity to get a serious amount of attention from different experts in the field, so we hope everyone focuses on that. I'd like to introduce our esteemed judges for today's session simona Pop of Status, jesse Walden from the Variant Fund, and Austin Griffith from the Ethereum Foundation. Welcome. We thank you very much for your time. And at which point I will now hand it off to Andy, our timekeeper, and I will go off camera. Good luck, everyone.
00:02:47.300 - 00:02:54.420, Speaker A: All right, so our first team is nFET. If you guys can start sharing your screen, we can get started.
00:02:57.030 - 00:03:00.040, Speaker B: Okay, great. I'm going to share my screen.
00:03:19.460 - 00:03:25.430, Speaker A: We did lose the video there. Or the audio. Yeah, the audio cut up, so maybe that mute doesn't work.
00:03:26.600 - 00:04:18.870, Speaker B: Okay, sorry about that. I'll start again. NFS is an interest earning AMM factory which takes ERC tokens and mints new ERC 20 share tokens that can be sold to buyers. So for our hack, we are making it as easy as possible to turn future creative work into interest bearing NFT markets so creators can gain funding with added interest. Here is a demo of how creating an NFX factory AMM contract address will work. If the creator has not yet made an NFT for their future piece, they can hear. Then this gets carried to where the creator can set the initial price and collateral type they wish to accept for their market.
00:04:18.870 - 00:05:01.100, Speaker B: Then they can choose the pricing structure with three different variants in the curve. Next, they can choose their risk strategy for earning interest. The collateral collected from selling the shares will be mirrored as deposits into Ave lending pools, earning interest by leveraging the Ave Protocol's, a token contract. Lastly, the contract address is created ready to be used for selling the ERC 20 share tokens.
00:05:03.200 - 00:05:03.950, Speaker A: You.
00:05:13.880 - 00:06:48.710, Speaker B: When the creator has their new market contract address, they can start accepting collateral from their shareholders. In this kind of market, a buyer will be able to interact freely, buying and withdrawing from the NFT market contract anytime the market is open. In the end, which we have not yet built. As part of our hack, the Creator will be able to close the market with a flick of a switch, causing the NFT market contract to distribute the ERC 20 share tokens to all 100 shareholders, trigger redemption of the collateral from the lending pool and allow the Creator to withdraw the collateral with interest as funding for their work. In this way, both creators and buyers benefit from staying in the market while it is open and waiting for the market to come to a natural close. Once all the share tokens are sold, this tool will be suited for any reputable creator who has willing shareholders waiting for their next project piece to drop. If the creator has a limited edition work or work that is collectible, then offering willing buyers shares to co own before it is complete will entice both parties to prefund the work and follow through with creating it.
00:06:48.710 - 00:07:30.160, Speaker B: The example shown here in our factory tool is just one application of this idea. Perhaps it could be used as an integration on audience's platform for recording artists to fund their albums. NFS could also be adapted to work as a Kickstarter, even going as far as making intellectual property for the creative work. The NFT itself, NFS allowing creators to gain upfront funding for their next creation before they make it. Okay, cool. That's the end of our video. And yeah, just a quick intro.
00:07:30.160 - 00:07:42.710, Speaker B: This is a little bit of an incomplete tack. We didn't 100% finish everything we wanted to, but we would be glad to get your feedback and your constructive criticism and our teammates can answer any of your questions.
00:07:44.440 - 00:08:17.650, Speaker A: Yeah, q and A will now begin. Yeah. Great job. It was a really well done presentation, very clear and it's a very cool product idea as well. One quick question I had is the risk settings that you showed there was a low risk and medium risk? I guess I'm curious how you pick those and if you have any thoughts on how that might work in the future and how important it is for your users to understand the risk that they're being exposed to.
00:08:20.260 - 00:08:56.910, Speaker B: Yes, I can answer that question with a quick answer. We didn't fully explore all the possibilities of risk that we wanted to, and that is one of our future improvements that we want to add different risk strategies of different interests. Like, for instance, there's some high risk pools from Year and there's some low risk pools from pull together. But essentially we start off with Aave just lending pools because it's low risk to medium risk kind of interest. And yeah, if anyone else from the team wants to answer that question as well.
00:08:59.360 - 00:09:22.070, Speaker A: Yeah, hi. So future integration, we would like to ideally there would be some sort of API call to Aave and we would choose of three different options, like a low risk, medium risk, and a high risk pool. And that would sort of pre populate the NFA page with options.
00:09:24.040 - 00:10:00.288, Speaker B: You know what would be interesting just off the top of my head? To have like a sliding bar where you could essentially increase it and then maybe pull from other protocols as well. So you can kind of go from very low and then increase, increase, increase like a sliding like a slider. I think that would be very good UX, wise and very simple. And maybe you could have small explanations underneath to kind of give people a sense of what that might mean. But yeah. Great work. This is awesome.
00:10:00.454 - 00:10:27.844, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's neat. It's so cool that this is what a hackathon project looks like now. Like all the cool building pieces and all the parts and all the nomenclature that comes together to make what you guys are calling an incomplete hack. This is a pretty awesome project. I think getting that redemption piece in is pretty important. But I like the trick. I'm assuming you use the trick where they're buying these NFTs in a very discreet one off manner and that helps a lot with the curve.
00:10:27.844 - 00:10:44.800, Speaker A: So you don't have to do a bunch of tricky calculus, but I would say double props on kind of using that hack. It's kind of a cheat code in Ethereum right now. You can do discrete buys of NFTs and you can do them on a curve without having to do a bunch of complicated calculus.
00:10:46.660 - 00:11:14.920, Speaker B: And also, just quickly, before we run out of time, you guys should have a chat to the team at Loft Radio. I know they're doing some work on Loft Radio where it started off as a passion project and now I think the team wants to expand it quite a bit. So yeah, get in touch with them. I think it's loft radio and then underscore on Twitter. They're a great team. Have a little chat to them. You never know, that might be an interesting convergence.
00:11:15.340 - 00:11:34.050, Speaker A: That's a great point. Like next steps here, find a couple of these artists and get them on the platform, and that's a great way to get traction 100% real quick. Any thoughts on when a creator might decide to close the market? At what point? What would be the catalyst for that? What's an example?
00:11:35.140 - 00:11:57.380, Speaker B: We did write the contract that it only mints 100, ERC, 20, so almost like 100% share. So we do kind of treat these buyers as shareholders, so that would be one of the places to close it. But we also had an idea of a staged closing as well. So if they get to 20% of their shareholders or 40% of their shareholders, we would think about doing a staged closing.
00:11:58.040 - 00:12:12.700, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. That about wraps up q and A. Thank you for your time. Great project, guys. Thanks, guys. All right, so the next team will be Astral Dow.
00:12:12.700 - 00:12:16.510, Speaker A: If you guys could start sharing your screen, that would be nice.
00:12:18.560 - 00:12:57.364, Speaker C: The Astro protocol. The first decentralized protocol to bring trusted geospatial data and analytics to web3 applications. The problems that we're trying to solve include the lack of transparency between spatial data providers and end users. Secondly, very few web3 apps truly make an impact in the real world. And thirdly, various spatial enabled fields like Spatial Finance cannot move forward unless there's a proven way to ensure the validity of geospatial data. In order to solve this, we create this Astro Protocol, a web3 spatial data standard. We capture data through our data capture layer and store it on the distributed storage layers such as IPFS or Filecoin.
00:12:57.364 - 00:13:35.980, Speaker C: Then we perform some type of analytics on this data and feed it into the smart contracts through an oracle. This data and insights that we gain can then be used in smart contract logic to create sustainable or any types of DApps that rely on spatial data. One of the things we created was a geodid. It's a did document that is based off of the Spacetotemporal Asset Catalogs. These are a list of web two specifications for spatial data. By creating the geodid, we're creating a new primitive for representing spatial data assets in web3. We also developed these smart contract NFT Verifiable data registries that utilize the graph.
00:13:35.980 - 00:14:04.076, Speaker C: Basically, we can track and register these geodids through NFTs on the blockchain and we can query them through the graph. So we're representing the geodid as an NFT on the blockchain network. Essentially. We also created an interactive UX focused DAP that has a frictionless web3 experience and wallet integration. So, I want to show you guys the application that we built. Here is the geolocker. This is the front end application.
00:14:04.076 - 00:14:40.356, Speaker C: I'm going to connect our wallet with MetaMask, and then I'm going to drop a Stack item into this area. This is the Stack item that we're loading. It's basically an extended GeoJSON. And then we're going to register the geo NFT and confirm the transactions. Keep in mind that this is happening on the Robson network. So it might take a while, but during in the background, basically, we drop the stack item in and it's basically converting the stack item into a geodid document. It's going to then take this geodid document and also mint an NFT, and while it's minting the NFT, it's going to bind it to the user's account or wallet, essentially.
00:14:40.356 - 00:15:19.472, Speaker C: And this way the user can represent the geodid document as an NFT on the blockchain network. They can sell this NFT, they can trade the NFT, they can do multiple things. Also, the NFT will hold certain metadata within it that we can use to further the application and leverage other types of possibilities. So any second now, it should confirm. The transaction is confirmed now, and you can see that the geo NFT successfully registered. So now the user has the NFT in their wallet and they also have the geodid registered to their name or it's binding to their NFT, essentially. And so in a summary, we created the geodid document.
00:15:19.472 - 00:16:11.530, Speaker C: We also created this NFT that binds to it, and we also created a DAP front end that allows producers of spatial data to register and query their asset catalogs in a seamless web3 like manner. Our team is well suited for this because some of the teammates have geospatial background and some of us have a lot of web3 background. We were asking for a $50,000 for our precede round, and we want this money to finish the protocol implementation and also onboard our first spatial DApps, essentially. And we also need the money to further our research and development for the geodids and also converting this web two stack item into more of a web3 thing that works with distributed file storages. And feel free to reach out to us at our website or fund us at our Gitcoin grants. Thank you.
00:16:17.470 - 00:17:15.710, Speaker A: All right, q a will now begin. It's funny with projects like this, we always find when it's such a big project and there's so many pieces that have to come together to make it work, you find that as you set off on this ambitious journey, there's holes in infrastructure and standards and tooling. And it seems like kind of the geo did was one of those things where you kind of realized going into it like, oh shoot, we don't have this standard here, we need to implement that also. So it's cool. I'd like to kind of ask a question back to you guys of other missing holes or things that you guys found that you wish was there before you. Like, if you could talk to yourself three weeks ago, what would be the tool you would give you to help maybe complete this a little better even? Yeah, that's a great question. At every single kind of layer in that protocol we were talking about, we find there's a lot of work to be done.
00:17:15.710 - 00:18:24.062, Speaker A: So data capture, you have satellites orbiting the Earth, taking pictures of the Earth that's all kind of designed and developed over the last decades, not necessarily ready for Web Three. So we would love to have secure enclaves on the satellite so it would encrypt the data so that could be sort of owned by the people who put the satellite into orbit from end to end. Data storage. We don't see loads of cloud native geospatial processing capabilities in IPFS yet. Things like being able to do spatial queries. Like, I just want to look up this little segment of satellite imagery and all the way into the smart contracts where you have some really early stage location based, decentralized applications that are starting to come out, the foam token curated registry. You see some decentraland, you see some pretty rudimentary ways of representing spatial data, but it's pretty computationally intensive and it's just these kind of two worlds that don't necessarily fit well together on the surface.
00:18:24.062 - 00:19:04.590, Speaker A: So, yeah, at every layer we saw some things that we wish we'd seen. I think probably the biggest one is the cloud native geospatial on IPFS because we're trying to apply analytics on the fly to satellite images so we can assess whether an area was flooded or if there's more forests grown there or if a solar array has been installed. That's all really useful to use in a smart contract, but it's tough to get that insights reliably into the contract. That's interesting that it's that stuff and not it's interesting. I call them web two problems, I guess, because I'm so ingrained in Web three. But it's interesting that it's kind of a non Web Three problem. Or I guess storage in IPF is kind of a Web three problem.
00:19:04.590 - 00:19:44.014, Speaker A: But that wasn't what I was expecting to hear. And you kind of glazed over the Oracle too, which to me is the scariest part. Yeah, no, to be fair, I guess a lot of those capabilities I was just talking about, they exist in Web Two. But if we have 100 million dollar insurance contract writing on satellite images we need to have and the whole process is automated, we're not really willing to accept an insurance. You got to have those integrity and quality guarantees. So, yeah, we're definitely thinking distant future in a lot of ways on this, but also thinking really hard about how it can be useful today. And that's really kind of what we're focusing our energy on at this point.
00:19:44.014 - 00:20:17.400, Speaker A: That's tough. Yeah. So quick question I had is I'm at least vaguely aware of a number of projects working on geospatial data in the space. It seems my understanding from the presentation is you're building a lot of the stack out yourself. And I guess to Austin's point, he's sort of asking about what unknown or known unknowns are there. I'm curious, have you looked at others in the space? Is there stuff you considered building on top of and decided against. So we have looked around the space.
00:20:17.400 - 00:20:59.106, Speaker A: We haven't found too many who are really doing what we're trying to do. Things that come to mind. The Ibisa network, which is inclusive, blockchain insurance using space assets. They provide insurance for sort of bottom billion farmers and they've got a dashboard where users can go on and analyze satellite imagery to see if crops are growing and if they're not, they pay off the farmers. But they haven't quite figured out how to automate that process of getting satellite imagery into smart contracts. It's been a goal since the white paper. Right? Exactly.
00:20:59.106 - 00:21:29.054, Speaker A: And I completely understand. They're just like, this is so hard, let's just get to actually providing services for these people. I'm actually a watcher with the Visa, so I've been following their journey for a while. And the watcher is the kind of analyst who goes on their dashboard and then submits a vote essentially attesting whether or not we want to get to the point where you can reliably consume satellite imagery analytics in smart contracts. Likewise phone protocol. They're doing the Token curated registry, but they're also doing dynamic proof of location, which is to replace GPS. Right.
00:21:29.054 - 00:21:59.878, Speaker A: To give localization services to phones that connect to their network, we would take those coordinates and use them in our Geodids. So as we see it, we actually are complementing most of the projects we see in the space. We were talking to one the other day called Geoweb that was also kind of building this like AR overlay over the real world that will be up for the Q A. Great. OK, great. Thanks guys. Thanks everyone.
00:21:59.878 - 00:22:01.446, Speaker A: Thank you John.
00:22:01.548 - 00:22:15.198, Speaker B: I'm going to drop a quick link in the chat for you. There's a really cool project that UNICEF and ITU are working on. I don't know if Christina yesterday from UNICEF mentioned it, but I'm going to link it, which might be interesting for you guys to look at.
00:22:15.284 - 00:22:17.374, Speaker A: Thanks Simona. Thanks everyone. Thank you.
00:22:17.412 - 00:22:19.840, Speaker B: Thanks. Great work.
00:22:20.930 - 00:23:29.312, Speaker A: All right, so for our next team I'll be introducing if you guys can start sharing your screen. Okay, I'm going to share screen it. There isn't any audio at the moment. If you could try sharing with the like after clicking the bottom left button if it and back end. All right, we can hear it. I'm going to start. Hi.
00:23:29.312 - 00:24:05.820, Speaker A: We are Team Iro. This is built for east online 2020 the project in this hackathon was implemented by two people. My name is Toshiki Takase and I worked on Frontend and other is Tukasanaguchi. He worked on smart contract and backend. So we built a platform to support the fair launch of tokens. These tokens serve as a connection between creators and fans. For creators they can easy to issue and distribute tokens and for fans they can get tokens directly from the creators.
00:24:05.820 - 00:24:50.010, Speaker A: It uses solidity the graph chain link and odius fast the creators can set up the details and issue tokens. The token data is synced with the graph and used on the front end. Creators who are using Odius to distribute music can get a list of their followers and distribute tokens. When a fan wants to withdraw tokens, the acceptance or rejection is accomplished by checking the list of followers stored on IPFS via chain link. So let's jump into the demo. Hi, I'm Kasanovici. Let's start an application demo.
00:24:50.010 - 00:26:04.950, Speaker A: This is a top page of application for both creators and funds. First, we are going to create a token as a creator. In this page, we can input our own token with basic and additional information and click on Create Token. We can see news is online token on Create a dashboard Token's. Information is fetched using subgraph for this page and other pages, we can withdraw our vesting token as time goes on, change taking status and distribute token with audios. Okay, let's go to audience setting page. In this page, we can decide how many tokens should be distributed for audience users who is a Followers of Creators.
00:26:04.950 - 00:26:53.670, Speaker A: Now let's distribute 10% of token. Clicking on Transfer Tokens sends a token to Contract which actually distributes and click on Start to enable user to withdraw tokens. Now, let's turn into fun operation. This is an audience page. This page shows audience user information and withdrawal form. Please note that transactions in this page is processed with Audience Wallet. Instead of MetaMask, first input a contract address which user wants to withdraw a token and click on Request.
00:26:53.670 - 00:27:33.592, Speaker A: After requesting token, click a check button to check that user can withdraw or not. And if user can do it, withdraw button is appeared, click Withdraw button and then token is transferred to User's Audience Wallet. This is a short demonstration of application. Thank you. Nice. All right. Yeah.
00:27:33.592 - 00:27:34.730, Speaker A: Q A will start.
00:27:35.420 - 00:27:43.310, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Quick question. Can I import an existing token? So let's say.
00:27:47.360 - 00:27:57.040, Speaker A: Only creator can create new own token and they cannot import existing token.
00:27:57.860 - 00:28:06.210, Speaker B: Okay, so I'd have to create it within your platform. I can't just bring my existing one if I'm an artist in. Okay.
00:28:07.720 - 00:29:10.410, Speaker A: Yeah. I love all the integrations you guys use to put this together. I think that's super cool. And I think it's also interesting you're using audience followers as sort of a distribution mechanism. And yeah, I guess I'm curious if you thought at all about beyond followers, what else could you do from there in terms of offering creators more options to reward their fans other than Odius? Yeah. What else did you consider? Yeah, we can introduce like Twitter or Patreon and anything which provides our API. We can use followers using chainlink if it has it.
00:29:10.410 - 00:30:02.324, Speaker A: So, just to make sure I have the right mental model of what happens here is basically a creator can come here and mint an ERC 20 and kind of customize the distribution. And with those customization settings. Then other people can log in with audience and prove that they're followers. Or is it the other way around? The creator logs in with their audience and proves how does the audience integration work? Just to clear it up in my head, creator can log in with Odius, then they can set the Odious followers list to the APFS. Then after that, the follower of the followers can withdraw the token from that list. Cool. Got it.
00:30:02.324 - 00:30:26.028, Speaker A: Okay. I like the accessibility here. This is a really neat thing to be able to take a Web Three tool and make it something that someone can just jump in and use. I think we're going to see an explosion of tools like that and then the second order effects of those things on our ecosystem and a lot of other ecosystems. So good job on this. And this is a fun project. Hopefully you get people in there clicking and deploying tokens, right? That's what we want to see.
00:30:26.028 - 00:30:28.830, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
00:30:29.220 - 00:30:30.448, Speaker B: Great work, guys.
00:30:30.614 - 00:31:36.084, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great. I think it's super cool. And we've just started to scratch the surface of what these tokens would look like, or what the interactions between creators and their audience will look like once the tokens are distributed. So the tool is step one, and then the next step is figuring out what the interactions that people want actually are and how to extend the tool to accommodate that, which I guess since we have 30 seconds, I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Do you guys have any idea as to what kind of behavior you expect from creators and their audience once the token is distributed? Sorry, again. What do you think these creators and their fans will do once they have tokens from using your tool? I want to communicate the creators and fund each other. So if the creator send to their fans their token, it is not sending money, it's just communication tool.
00:31:36.084 - 00:31:54.444, Speaker A: So I want to be creators and fans. They transfer their own token to each other. Cool. That's everything for Q A. Thank you for thanks, guys. Thank you. Thank you.
00:31:54.444 - 00:32:02.590, Speaker A: Bye. All right, so the next team is Tonic. If you guys could start sharing your screen, we can get started.
00:32:07.330 - 00:32:30.642, Speaker D: Despite Ethereal's success, mass adoption is yet to come. Our main issues are unintuitive UX and high transactional costs. We need a killer app for this. Here enters Tonic. Tonic is a decentralized bank account. It offers fast payments, savings and investments. The account is denominated in dollars and completely hides Ethereum to the user.
00:32:30.642 - 00:33:04.930, Speaker D: The UX designed to be like that of a Web Two Challenger bank. To be clear, there is not a single interaction of the user with the blockchain. As a matter of fact, the user does not own any Ether. Everything is paid in dollars. To achieve a seamless experience, we have used all tools at our disposal. Thanks to porties, users can revert to a wellknown credentials flow using email and password. We use USDC as base currency thanks to its support for native meta transactions and ease of on and off ramp each layer one interaction is intermediated by the Biconomy relayer network.
00:33:04.930 - 00:33:30.138, Speaker D: For cheap and fast transfers. We opted for Zksync as it seems the best suited for this task. Unfortunately, Zksync does not support metadata for transactions or recipients. So here it comes. Textiled with threaddb where we store metadata on behalf of the user. We also implemented decentralized notifications for incoming transactions using the mailbox API. For the saving accounts we use a centralized vault which lends funds onto the hava money market.
00:33:30.138 - 00:33:55.858, Speaker D: For the investment part, the first product is a bitcoin dollar cost averaging where the user can choose how much to invest every month or week. These funds come out of the collective vault and purchase tokenized bitcoin using one inch for best execution. So let's see Tonic in action. Now we first log in porties using a previously created account. We recommend setting Tonic as a trusted app. By doing so, requests are automated. The first screen is the balance screen.
00:33:55.858 - 00:34:19.922, Speaker D: We top up the current account. In mainnet we would top up using a card or a bank transfer. Now we can deposit into the savings account. This is also an l One metatransaction. Now we can also deposit onto the FastPay account. This is another l One metatransaction. Let's move into the investment screen.
00:34:19.922 - 00:34:40.806, Speaker D: Our first product is a simple DCA for Bitcoin. I select amount and purchase period. And off we go. This is our last l One meta transaction. Let's do something a little different. Now by opening the profile screen we can see our address. Below it we can claim a unique Tonic tag which allows an easier payment experience.
00:34:40.806 - 00:34:56.750, Speaker D: I guess we got to choose Alice. We can now see the fast pay experience. Here we show both sender and recipient screens. Firstly we select the amount, then the recipient. In this case we know the Tonic tag. You would have guessed right? It's Bob. Finally, we send.
00:34:56.750 - 00:35:12.306, Speaker D: This is a layer two transaction. Once the transaction is accepted by Zksync, Bob receives a notification for his payment. Let's look at the transactions list to Ascertain. We got our cash. Sweet. The transaction is there, metadata included. It seems Alice forgot something.
00:35:12.306 - 00:35:32.410, Speaker D: With Tonic you can also send requests for payments. For the time being is just a notification, but we will make it more user friendly. This ends our demo. I hope you all enjoyed it. There is a demo version deployed in Robson. The app is still very rough, but this could be a game changer.
00:35:35.630 - 00:36:17.906, Speaker A: It kind of goes on to the same thing I was saying earlier about how good these hackathon projects are getting. Because the underlying technology and the building blocks are getting so much easier. This is not something that's new, right? Like we've always wanted a great UX wallet. We've always wanted something. That has instant onboarding and feels like a normal thing and people get the mental model. But as new building blocks come in and as new L2 solutions come out, this build, this idea gets a little bit more advanced and a little bit more closer to reality each time. So just good job on thinking about the user first and focusing on making basically ave as a backend into a wallet for a user with instant onboarding.
00:36:17.906 - 00:37:05.750, Speaker A: So just props on this. Good job. Thanks a lot tolsten yes. The plan was to do something for my mom, something my mom can use without much knowledge of how dream works. And I was surprised that there isn't anything like that out yet. I mean, there are some great wallets, but still you need fairly comprehensive understanding of what's out there and what's gas and even like swapping tokens and stuff like that. This is like a way to offer a curated window into DeFi, into all the Ethereum ecosystem that can then be easily understood by people at the moment that are not in the ecosystem.
00:37:05.750 - 00:37:22.942, Speaker A: The closest thing I know of is Argent. I think the Argent wallet is probably the closest to this experience. But there's still a lot of main net like L One stuff and you kind of glaze over those too. Right? Here's an l one. Here's an l one. Now we're in L2, but it's like we had to skip some stuff there.
00:37:23.076 - 00:37:23.710, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:37:23.860 - 00:37:44.340, Speaker A: And with meta transactions, now you can abstract the L One, and the other hope is that with the Red business model, you can subsidize also the gas. And with the AP 1559, things probably going to also get better there. But yeah, you can subsidize gas and make things work for free, basically.
00:37:47.370 - 00:37:50.680, Speaker B: So are you guys going to continue expanding on this?
00:37:51.450 - 00:37:58.006, Speaker A: Well, I'm the only one at the moment. Yes.
00:37:58.108 - 00:38:00.614, Speaker B: Project with all of these things. Awesome.
00:38:00.812 - 00:38:52.730, Speaker A: It was a bit of a challenge that I gave myself, like, say, like ten days. Let's see if I can do something usable. I mean, obviously there are massive security holes that still need to be audited and fixed, but the idea is, can we build with the current state of Ethereum, a Monzo or a Revolute in ten days, one person, and then can we keep it running? And what's the opex saving out of that? Because like, Monzola samajakto was 1500 people. So yeah, that's the idea. We can now build these things with Ethereum and I think that was somehow also part of the promise. DeFi lays the foundation of all this, what you can do with money market, even with derivatives and stuff like that. But at the end of the day, we need to bubble this up to the final user.
00:38:52.730 - 00:39:46.486, Speaker A: Yeah, great job identifying all the existing pieces in the stack and sort of putting them together in a useful way. I'm curious, given more time, is there anything else you would have done to make the product more complete or desirable. Yeah, definitely. There is things around Partisan is great and I'm also talking to them. There are things around MFA and stuff to increase security and also the UX of saving the private keys and stuff like that. That also argent has done quite a good job there with social recovery, but definitely yes and then expanding the offering. Things like pull together with a nice UI on top could be quite a good drive for acquisition.
00:39:46.486 - 00:40:37.914, Speaker A: And then the other big thing is like customer acquisition for me, and we've seen interesting way of distributing and Jesse probably shouldn't be telling you this, but we've seen interesting ways of distributing apps and to acquire customer and although liquidity mining has gone a bit, it's ending badly somehow. But I think that there is some initial very nice dynamic there. And my dream is to have users that become owners. That's the dream. A bit like uniswap, like someone used the platform and is also an owner of the platform in a tokenized way. So those are the areas that's awesome all the time we have for Q A. Thank you for your time.
00:40:37.914 - 00:40:38.378, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:40:38.464 - 00:40:39.594, Speaker B: Very well done.
00:40:39.712 - 00:40:43.422, Speaker A: Yeah, great. Thanks.
00:40:43.556 - 00:40:44.574, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:40:44.772 - 00:41:26.810, Speaker A: All right. Introducing the next team is Vega Markets Explorer. If you guys could start sharing your screen. So what I'm going to present to you now is my Vega Markets Explorer, which is pulling information from the Vega Decentralized Derivatives Network and presenting in a way that's useful to traders. So we present the information in four different categories. The 25 largest open positions, the 25 most profitable traders, the 25 worst traders, and clusters of liquidations. So on this page, you can see the positions of all of the 25 largest traders.
00:41:26.810 - 00:42:18.380, Speaker A: You can see the way that they're trading long or short, the amount that they're trading, the entry price and how much money they've made. You can click into a trader. When you click into the party view, you will be able to see detail about all of the positions and orders that they are executing in the market. You can also see their open volume as it changes with time, their realized profit and loss and their unrealized profit. If we jump back to the home page, we can drill into the same view for the 25 most profitable traders and the 25 worst traders on the network. We can also flick between different markets. So here we can look at GBP USD and we can see how this sentiment graph at the top changes.
00:42:18.380 - 00:43:21.358, Speaker A: And what this graph is showing us is the sentiment in the market for the specific category that you've selected. So on this page, we can see that the losing traders on GBP USD are massively net short by 40 million contracts to what looks like about 1 million contracts here. And if we flick to look at the winning traders on GBP USD, what's interesting is we'll see they're doing almost exactly the opposite. So you can see that this is giving a really interesting insight into markets that is currently not available when the markets are made up of centralized exchanges and the centralized exchanges keep this information private and essentially keep it to themselves. And lastly, the final view shows the liquidation prices or the liquidation clusters in the market. And this looks a lot like a limit order book, but it's actually not. This is showing exactly the opposite of a limit order book.
00:43:21.358 - 00:44:18.130, Speaker A: We'll look at FUSD because it's interesting as this is a more active market on the network. What this is showing is all of the prices at which essentially stop losses or liquidations for traders are clustering. And this gives us a view of the market that we currently can't see anywhere right now and only centralized exchanges know about. And that is a view of where the market is likely to move a lot if it trades at those prices because the participants on the network become under collateralized. And so that's everything that has to show today. I hope that you enjoyed it. And you can see how this explorer gives some really interesting insights into market that we currently don't get to see whilst the market is made up of lots of centralized operators.
00:44:20.630 - 00:44:21.380, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:44:21.990 - 00:44:33.846, Speaker A: That liquidation graph, just as a primitive is neat, right? Just coming up with that is a cool thing that you wouldn't have even discovered. And now you see that as the price moves, this is what's going to happen. And like you said, it's like the.
00:44:33.868 - 00:44:38.326, Speaker B: Parting of the sea. It's just like literally a boom. Love it.
00:44:38.508 - 00:45:31.850, Speaker A: Yeah. I kind of need to overlay it with a limit order book so you can see how the two interact with each other. But I ran out of time. It's so funny, just when you have that data, now that it's on a decentralized network in public and it's exposed to us, what can we learn from it? And this is neat how you've parsed through it and kind of just tried to learn what you could learn. I like it. I'm curious, actually, what did you learn by sort of implementing this? What insights do you think are most interesting from looking at the data through your own visualizations? Yeah, so this was like running on a testnet, right, against the testnet where the bots themselves are kind of stupid. But what I was really surprised by was the view that I showed in the video where the GBP, USD, longs and shorts, sorry, winners and losers, were almost exactly oppositely positioned.
00:45:31.850 - 00:46:23.898, Speaker A: And so you could see that the money that's changing hands or virtual money that's changing hands between the parties that are trading on the network is literally going from the biggest winners to the biggest lose, from the biggest losers to the biggest winners. I found that quite interesting. I was also surprised when I drew the liquidation graph by how much volume was clustering near the mark price. And I found that quite interesting that although it's a testnet, the parties trading on the network were therefore quite under collateralized. That was quite interesting as well. So is Vega only on a testnet or like why testnet? Yeah, they're running only on a testnet right now. Okay.
00:46:23.898 - 00:47:27.854, Speaker A: I think the main net is like probably six months soon, TM. But it was interesting nonetheless to explore ways of getting this data and process. Where did you find yourself spinning your wheels the most here? Was it getting the data? Was it just interfacing with the graphs? I used this question earlier, but if you had to go back in time and kind of give yourself some information or some extra tooling, what would help you to do this again? Yeah, I think like preprocessing the data into a format that was useful to generate interesting visualizations. It's quite data intensive. It's like a 1 second block time on the network, so there's a lot of information to pass through to generate graphs that are actually useful. There's a whole bunch of network stuff in there that's not really useful for traders. And so that's why I kind of pitched it as like an alternative block explorer where it's just pulling out the useful pieces of information to people who are actually trading on the network that you wouldn't normally see on.
00:47:27.854 - 00:47:53.320, Speaker A: The user interface to an exchange, but that actually is there like deep in the network because usually this is kind of it still exists on a centralized exchange, but they don't make it public for some of the reasons that I mentioned. Whereas on a pseudonymous decentralized network it's unavoidable, but that levels the playing field as well. So you're pulling that stuff out was kind of a really interesting thing. And finding useful pieces to show.
00:47:55.450 - 00:48:04.122, Speaker B: Where do you see it evolving? Where do you want to take it? Do you see things like following the top ones, like functionality or anything like that?
00:48:04.256 - 00:49:06.894, Speaker A: Yeah, you could build customizable views that are interesting for you, like maybe you have a way for people to sign up, make it a bit more like social. But then there's also the other side of things where just to get the plugin in place to build the visualizations, you have to be connected to the nodes. And as the network grows, that ends up becoming like an engineering challenge in of itself. And you look at the bitcoin block Explorers and the ethereum projects like Infura and stuff that have had to do that, and then they turned this into like a SaaS product as well. So there's possibly an angle. So a few different that's the side quest I'd like to see is basically go on a tangent and take that liquidation histogram and apply it to uniswap and apply it to some other not uniswap, but apply it to some other primitives on Mainet Ethereum right now and see if you see what you see. Right.
00:49:06.894 - 00:49:26.662, Speaker A: You don't know what you don't know until you get there. Exactly. Yeah. It's like some of these posts that we've seen online about the Ethereum Dark Forest, and it's like someone's looked at the real low level stuff, but nobody's pulled out and made it visually available to everybody. All right, I'm going to interrupt that's all the time we have for Q and A. Thank you.
00:49:26.796 - 00:49:28.182, Speaker B: Awesome work. Thank you.
00:49:28.236 - 00:49:42.854, Speaker A: Thank you. Bye bye. All right, so the next team is Crypto pair. Start sharing your screen. Actually, there's a change. Crypto pair will be rescheduled. The next team will be blockchain.
00:49:42.854 - 00:49:44.250, Speaker A: ARPG.
00:49:58.700 - 00:49:59.544, Speaker E: Hello.
00:49:59.742 - 00:50:00.520, Speaker A: There we are.
00:50:00.590 - 00:50:01.896, Speaker E: Oh, there we go.
00:50:02.078 - 00:50:02.712, Speaker A: Cool.
00:50:02.846 - 00:50:05.080, Speaker E: I'm going to go ahead and share a window.
00:50:06.660 - 00:50:07.410, Speaker A: Okay.
00:50:09.460 - 00:50:26.276, Speaker E: Really quick, when we were rendering this, we had some issues. Would it be okay if I show my slides separately from the video? So I have my slides kind of separately from the video. It'd be okay if I just, like 1 minute, just fly through this and then just goes to the video, if that's all right.
00:50:26.458 - 00:50:27.732, Speaker A: Sure thing. Yeah. Okay.
00:50:27.786 - 00:51:02.610, Speaker E: Thank you so much. We just had some issues. All right, so Blockchain ARPG is an interest bearing esports video game. Basically, the game I'll explain it in the video, too works in kind of like a zombie survival game where you're by yourself in this arena with a bunch of waves coming at you. And the way the blockchain integrates into this is that we have a liquidity pool. So we are using Avi to deposit staked entries to a liquidity pool, which gains interest. And we're using the chain link VRF for random number generation, which dictates whether or not the player gets the special item at the end of the level.
00:51:02.610 - 00:51:42.110, Speaker E: So we use Biconomy USD coin chain link Maddox Unity for creating the game and audience for royalty free music. Future plans. We just have some future plans to develop more levels, make it more of a procedure generated, have multiplayer in there, improve some key features, of course, polish it up, implement new classes, customization and work on the blockchain integration part to make it less expensive for us and make it less expensive for the user. And just make things a lot smoother in general. So I'm just going to go ahead and show the video.
00:52:01.020 - 00:52:02.410, Speaker B: Can't hear anything.
00:52:04.300 - 00:52:05.770, Speaker E: You can't hear it.
00:52:07.100 - 00:52:10.420, Speaker A: I was wondering where that royalty free music is from. Audios.
00:52:10.500 - 00:52:11.130, Speaker B: Yes.
00:52:13.200 - 00:52:15.070, Speaker E: Let me 1 second.
00:52:16.640 - 00:52:20.248, Speaker A: Just remember to hit that box when yeah, I forgot.
00:52:20.344 - 00:52:54.732, Speaker E: I'm sorry. There you go. Everybody, this is Alfred Checker, the lead programmer on the Blockchain Action role playing game project. This project is made in Unity and is basically a survival game where you are dropped into this area here and you have to survive an onslaught of enemies that show up in waves. So right now we're at wave one, and there aren't a lot of enemies, but they will start walking towards the player and we have to kill them. So we have melt attacks, we have some range attacks we can use. We just use them close range.
00:52:54.732 - 00:53:32.384, Speaker E: And we killed an enemy here and he drops an item. So we pick up the item here. We got a long staff that's going to increase our magic damage. And that green object there was a health upgrade, too. So we're going to pick that up here, get some health and mana upgrades. So the point is to survive as long as you can in these waves and kill the enemies to get the items that they drop. And the longer you survive, you'll get to certain milestones.
00:53:32.384 - 00:54:27.810, Speaker E: And at wave five, the chain link API is used to generate a verifiable token, verifiable random token, that is an NFT token and that is possible to be acquired by a player. Coming into wave five. Wave three, we actually have power up response here. So we're going to go ahead and pick that up. We're going to try and go around these enemies, try and survive so we can see if we get the legendary drop for the NFT or if we don't. That's completely based on chance. So we're going to go ahead and go into the portal that was up here, that will take us to the room, that will spawn the object, and it's wave five.
00:54:27.810 - 00:54:36.580, Speaker E: We're going to go ahead and pick up these power ups. We just gained some health and mana. We're going to go into this room here, unfortunately.
