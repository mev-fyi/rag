00:00:06.250 - 00:00:40.780, Speaker A: Going to kick it off with the first panel. Very glad that it's hosted by one of my absolutely most favorite people in Web Three, Jose. Okay, Jose on Twitter. And he's joined by Andrea Magdalena from she said so easier campo from Refraction dao Amir aka Su from Blackhand and the man like Elijah. I think that's about it. We are good to go. So please, friends, enjoy.
00:00:42.270 - 00:01:10.420, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks for that setup, Mikhail. Excited to have this conversation with everyone here on culture, community and capital. I just want to kick it off by thanking everyone who's here today and everyone who's watching. First thing, just to set things up. I'd love for everyone to introduce themselves, what organization they're here representing, then answer the question that I think we're really here to talk about, which is, do you think DAOs are overrated or underrated? I'm going to throw it to Andrea first.
00:01:13.190 - 00:01:39.338, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. Pleasure to be here. Thank you, Mikhail, for the invitation. I'm really an amazing company right here. Some friends I know, some friends I'm about to make. So, yeah, great to be here overall. So I am originally from Romania, and I'm the founder of she Said So, a global community of women, gender, minorities and allies in the music industry that's been around since 2014.
00:01:39.338 - 00:02:04.660, Speaker C: And right now, we're about 15,000 people, 15,000 members distributed across 20 global chapters. And we still operate in a Web Two way, but definitely exploring what our future looks like in the Web Three space, given the fact that we finally have all the tools that we need to properly operate as a community, as a collaborative community. So excited to chat more about that.
00:02:05.930 - 00:02:09.640, Speaker B: Andrea, dows, overrated or underrated? You have to answer.
00:02:11.290 - 00:02:16.706, Speaker C: It's a double edged word, underrated. I would say underrated.
00:02:16.898 - 00:02:17.410, Speaker D: Cool.
00:02:17.500 - 00:02:19.260, Speaker B: I'm going to throw it to Cersei next.
00:02:21.630 - 00:03:16.134, Speaker D: How you guys doing? I'm Cersei. I'm a designer, anthropologist. I think a lot about agency and what we can do to create unique experiences for communities. I think as a designer, our responsibility is to be sort of like a shepherd that has a unique set of tools, but also we are kind of a teacher in enabling other people to take those same tools and build things for themselves. But dows, I was trying to find a great segue within that and the two things, but I couldn't. But I feel like dows are, I think contextually dows are underrated. But I think the way most people look at or interpret a dow, I think is incredibly overrated.
00:03:16.134 - 00:04:10.554, Speaker D: Like there's a lot of people that make Dows for the sake of Dows because of the word or the acronym, I suppose, and the fact that it's like a term that can be used to capture interest or at. Least when the bull market was going on like a lot of VC money without actually really seeing the level of depth that cooperatives mutual aid funds and a bunch of other preceding ways of gathering and galvanizing community and organizing for funds or for actions or for the combination of the two. They sort of disrespected the fact that we have this long history of self organizing, and so we're saying, oh, dows are the future. And so I think it was overrated in that context because it really downplayed a lot of the hard work that many of our preceding people have put together. Excellent.
00:04:10.602 - 00:04:11.614, Speaker E: Thanks for sharing that.
00:04:11.732 - 00:04:12.510, Speaker D: Izzy.
00:04:14.610 - 00:04:34.866, Speaker E: Well, thank you. I'm Izzy. I'm a musician, music educator, and I'm on the curatorial team at Refraction. I'm also the curatorial grants or creative grants lead at Refraction. Underrated or overrated? I have to agree with all the points here. Sue brought up. I think underrated as a coordination tool.
00:04:34.866 - 00:04:45.670, Speaker E: Overrated in the sense that a lot of the history around co op squats and collectives kind of gets erased. The Web Two organizing that's happened, but overall, underrated.
00:04:46.650 - 00:04:48.550, Speaker B: And last but not least, Elijah.
00:04:49.370 - 00:05:36.006, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Elijah. I'm from East London. My background is in DJing writing. My day job is, like, as an artist manager. Kind of spend a lot of time in clubs and yeah, got to meet people from all around the world, I guess dows for me are like underrated. A lot of communities that I come from are not engaging with them yet, and I'm excited to see what happens when people bring some of their communities that they have offline online and kind of broadly connect with other people doing similar things globally. I think the Internet has to agree, but giving people a home away from socials will be the stronger we can get.
00:05:36.006 - 00:05:38.566, Speaker A: That about cool.
00:05:38.748 - 00:05:55.360, Speaker B: So the first question I have here that I want to start off with, Andrea, is community in web three often gets treated like a commodity, and she said so has global chapters and membership in the tens of thousands. So I'm curious, how do you define community, and why was it important for you specifically to cultivate one?
00:05:57.090 - 00:06:40.294, Speaker C: That's a great way to start off because I was thinking about it the other day. I'm going to go way back to my university days because I always felt that I went to university and wasted my time there. I studied media and know a degree that doesn't really take you too far, but I then remember that my final dissertation was actually on the concept of collaborative work and the power of communities. At the time, Ted was just kind of like becoming this big platform where, you know, learn really cool stuff that you wouldn't be able to get in university or traditional education. And I was like, oh, wow, this is literally just generated by the people. Right? For the people. This is a really interesting concept.
00:06:40.294 - 00:07:39.230, Speaker C: So that's where I originally got inspired to create, she said. So then I was mostly spending a lot of time in tech. I was pursuing a career in tech, and somehow I ended up with Mixed Cloud, a music tech startup at the time, I was employee number five. I was really close to the founders and started diving deeper into the music industry, which obviously is a very community, relationship based kind of environment and a very collaborative one as well. There's a village behind each artist, behind each release. But obviously I noticed that there were some things that were wrong with it in terms of inclusion and representation. So I decided to do something about it, inspired by a tech community called Ada's List that I was a part of at the time, because I noticed that tech was talking about this thing called diversity, but the music business was, no, that's not something we care about as long as it doesn't drive profit sharing.
00:07:39.230 - 00:08:17.660, Speaker C: So I was always inspired by tech tools, basically. And I created this community inside of a google group. It still exists inside of a google group and multiple other platforms in terms of our local chapters around the world. When I first created it, there was nothing like it, apart from maybe one US organization that was a nonprofit and it was a bit clunky and old and wasn't really relevant anymore. So we came in. I was living in London at the time, so she said, still has a huge presence in the UK and Europe. I lived in London for seven years, and that's where the community grew really fast.
00:08:17.660 - 00:08:44.018, Speaker C: But then obviously the music industry is a global environment. It's a global ecosystem. The word spread even further and then I started having all these people reaching out, oh hey, I really believe in what you're doing. I really love the ethos. Men didn't feel aggravated by it. They felt included in this CIS men, they felt included in this movement. They felt like, okay, we're trying to fix things together.
00:08:44.018 - 00:09:26.740, Speaker C: And that was something that was very important for me to communicate from the get go that we're here to create alliances and partnerships and collaborations between all genders, really. But first we need us women to get together as a group and sense check each other, make sure we're not crazy. This is actually something that all women are experiencing. Help each other out, create a bigger voice, and then show the world that hey, we need to be listened to. Just hear us out. And as the community grew beyond the word of mouth level over the next three years or so, we didn't have a website, we didn't have a brand identity, social media. It was literally just that google group.
00:09:26.740 - 00:10:19.010, Speaker C: Obviously as we scaled and all these local chapters popped up with their own sort of platforms, it became more and more difficult to maintain this sort of consistent ethos. And the way in which we manifested that ethos, I think it's still there. If people hear about through conversations, I think that those values are still carried there. But in terms of operations, how we manifest how we operate together to collaborate on curating playlists and curating events and all of that. It's a mess, I tell you. It's hugely difficult. And that's why I'm at this place where I'm exploring Web Three solutions, because there's nothing in Web Two that is able to help us out.
00:10:19.010 - 00:11:07.300, Speaker C: And so for me to go back to your original question, community means people coming together with shared interests and shared commitment. Because at the beginning, there was a lot of shared interests and people asking for things. And it was important for us to introduce this community rule that you first have to give something before you ask for something. And that you maintain your commitment to the community as much as you take from it. How you track that and how you manage that and ensure that it's the case and you reward participation. The way we've done that so far has been very analog and very imperfect. So I'm excited to explore these new tools available to us.
00:11:08.470 - 00:11:42.640, Speaker B: Sirsu, you touched on this, and I think Elijah did as well. So for folks like Andrea and the communities that Elijah mentioned that are sort of like not yet tapped in or just curious or just getting started, you've been around the block a bit. I'm curious if you could speak to the ways in which you've seen organic or more naturally formed communities kind of falter as they step into web three and the ways in which that kind of web three systems can sometimes trip you up or cause things to kind of go awry because there's edges that are difficult to understand if you're not kind of hip to what's going on.
00:11:43.250 - 00:11:44.880, Speaker D: Oh, man, that's a great question.
00:11:46.130 - 00:11:46.880, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:48.370 - 00:12:46.046, Speaker D: I think the one thing that a lot of folks one of the first things that trips people up is that and this is just not just like Web Three and Dallas, but this is just I think the nature of crypto in general is that it's not a passive place. This requires a lot of real active participation. A lot of the time. It should still be healthy, though. It's not like you need to spend every waking hour doing this. But because things start with you and the aspect of the permissionless models that we're all kind of dealing with, everything's opt in, right? Or more so I guess the better way to say is everything asks you if it's okay to do something without your wallet or without your key or the means of you engaging with this space. Nothing happens with you in it.
00:12:46.046 - 00:14:26.820, Speaker D: Right? So you're almost, in a way, like the center of your own universe or gravity as it relates to Web Three, so is everyone else. And so how do you take something that is so, I guess, centered around your individual agency and pair it up with other people's ideas of agency to create something larger than yourself? And it requires all of you to be really dedicated to the cause of getting over the hump, right? Because nothing in this space right now is very easy or immediate except for the gratification of you send something to a wallet, you automatically receive it, right? So it's real good at hitting that dopamine on that aspect of it. But everything else still requires human work, which is often the hardest thing to do. And you can't hack it, but if you have shared and aligned incentives to say, hey, let us all use these tools, this ecosystem, this environment, because we see how after we've laid the groundwork, that it can start to flourish in ways that we couldn't have had dreamed of before then. That's what really catalyzes that type of really unique growth that you see in certain communities. For example, like FWB, right? Like it started as a small group of people just kind of sharing and keeping in touch with each other in discord, and it ended up turning into, let's start inviting really cool and amazing dope people that are curious about this space and are willing to try it and see how it organically grows into something larger. And now it's like one of the best socially engineered spaces within Web Three.
00:14:26.820 - 00:15:35.574, Speaker D: But I think that the first thing that trips people up is not really understanding that it's more than empowerment in this space. It's all about capturing your agency and actually having it work for you or work for you in that sense. I think the second thing is web Three inherently is financialized, right? Like, everything is a transaction, whether that is real currency or social currency, cultural currency. Somebody is exchanging something for something else. And many people, in many ways, if you don't have the right guardrails around what your project, what your community is representative of, then it leaves room for folks to sort of interpret that for you or interpret that for that community. And sometimes you can create a schism when you have folks that are only really interested in just the potential upside or the speculation of how big that upside might be or how wide or how vast, like your community might penetrate a particular market or set of markets. And so you have to always sort of remind people, listen, this is the intent of why we're here.
00:15:35.574 - 00:16:12.482, Speaker D: This is why we are pushing our funds together. This is why we're communicating, because we see this larger goal. And it's okay if you want to speculate on that, if you're passive, if you're like. I want to help because I see the value in this, but I'm not going to contribute. I think that's okay. But what ends up getting an issue is when things get tough and markets get rocky, then those same people come knocking and saying, well, what have you guys done yet? I put three ETH in this. When you guys started, I bought another ten ETH worth of NFTs and everything's like 70% off what's going on.
00:16:12.482 - 00:17:14.630, Speaker D: And it's like, well, I mean, you believed in us. You gave us the money to invest in what we're doing. But like all good things, it takes time. That's the other thing that trips people up too, when folks come knocking and saying, hey, where's my piece? You have to have the resolve and the fortitude to say, well, listen, rewards are comparable in relation to what you put in, but also what you contribute. And if you're a passive player, then you are going to be sort of tied to the way the market is working and there are certain things that we can do to sort of mitigate that. But at the end of the day, this is bigger than you. So I say those are really some of the two biggest things that I normally see that create breakdown, both in the early stages of kind of porting existing communities into this new paradigm, but then also folks that have already been native, I think sometimes the financialization hurts the most or hits the most.
00:17:14.630 - 00:17:18.054, Speaker D: More so than the collective agency aspect of it.
00:17:18.172 - 00:17:42.400, Speaker B: Yeah, on that subject, perfect set up for something else I was thinking about, which is a question for Izzy. I'd love for you to maybe talk a little bit more in depth about Refraction Dow and what it is. And I'm curious, specifically with financialization being kind of a two edged sword, do you think that Refraction Dao and the work that y'all are doing could exist in a world without crypto? And how are you navigating the challenges that seriously just talked about?
00:17:43.330 - 00:18:33.554, Speaker E: That's a really good question. So Refraction is a collective of music artists, visual artists, and I think people who just really generally appreciate culture. I think that maybe to answer your last question first, if I think that it could exist in a world without crypto. Yes, I think so. I think that coordinating people who are passionate and share values around music and art and culture is totally possible. I think that coordinating at this scale probably not. And I think trying to have incentive mechanisms that make people want to participate and encourage them to have investment in, for instance, our creative grants program.
00:18:33.554 - 00:19:29.010, Speaker E: Being able to apply to the creative grants program and also vote on the applications that we receive is not something that's I think done in this kind of really distributed way. There are obviously grants programs and voting bodies and awards bodies that do this kind of thing, but not where it's like your community is deciding essentially who's getting funds allocated. And I think it's in a much less stratified way where I think with so many music and culture organizations, it's the same people who get shine and who get access and resources. It's kind of like a snowball effect. And I think with Refraction we're really focused on just people who are doing interesting and cool work and because there's so much less of a focus on one particular region or one medium. I think we see a lot of different artists that aren't.
00:19:31.430 - 00:19:32.322, Speaker D: Maybe the people.
00:19:32.376 - 00:21:02.990, Speaker E: That within music, for instance, not the same people over and over again. I also think just in terms of the way that I think about Red Bull Music Academy a lot in terms of what it did for music a couple of years ago, in terms of putting people on, like, doing really cool festivals, kind of like bridging the gap between underground and mainstream artists. And there's probably to me, I don't know if other people agree, but like a really big vacuum in that space for curating, really cool music and art festivals that kind of make connections for people and really are really well curated and thought through. And it's interesting because a lot of the people in Refraction who work on the curatorial side, editorial side, come from they're not necessarily like crypto native. We have people from the lot, we have people from RBMA, we have people from UTech. And I think that because of the tools and technology, people are way more reinvigorated to think about doing festivals and doing curation and doing editorial work because they're not so focused on like, oh, I have to do some really lame brand partnership with some soda company in order to pull this off. It's way more about the people who are involved and everyone is aligned around what matters.
00:21:02.990 - 00:21:48.320, Speaker E: Prioritizing artists thinking about fair compensation, being able to really kind of handhold and walk alongside artists instead of being extremely exploitative and thinking about how can we get the most out of somebody, it's really a lot more about thinking through what's best for a fraction is also like, what's best for the artists that we work with. So it was a little bit long winded. But yeah, I think that what we're doing in some ways could be done in web two, but I think because of the landscape, probably not, because a lot of people who do the work have been burned or lost. Faith in legacy systems for doing this kind of.
00:21:50.050 - 00:22:05.410, Speaker B: And Elijah, in kind of a similar vein, the communities that you work with, the spaces that you're in, you mentioned that a lot of them aren't yet kind of like plugged into what's going on in this space. I'm curious about why you think that is and what kind of hurdles need to be gotten over for them to start to experiment.
00:22:06.230 - 00:22:41.262, Speaker A: Yeah, in music, people are still working in a pop star format. So in campaigns like releasing albums and then going to send things to press and my manager is going to do this an agent, they're not really thinking about the ways they can kind of always be on or be part of things, even if they're at a certain level. So you have this kind of weird bottleneck that happens with people that maybe have put out good work and have been platformed to a level. They kind of get plateaued. They don't know what to do next. They think, oh, maybe I'll do more PR. Maybe I can get onto a website that will give me better press.
00:22:41.262 - 00:23:56.754, Speaker A: I'm like, no, you should be joining the things where there's that you can bounce off and be given as much as you're taking. But I don't think people are seeing in that way most of the time. So you kind of have this weird dynamic where, say someone's releasing an album and then they'd be like, hey, Elijah, I need a web free strategy for this. Can I make some NFTs of my album? They don't know what they're talking about or anything like that, but they know that it's a space where there's a lot of artists and creatives, but it's something that's nearly like an afterthought rather than something that they're building into the way they're creating or something that they genuinely want to engage in with people. And it's a shame because in that I guess that two year period where everyone was at home, a lot of people that I know and I'm sure most of us have battled with not being able to kind of concentrate on creating or being part of communities. And now there is this kind of other thing. People just want to be outside, they want to be at festivals, want to be in the park, and maybe not at a computer so much so there's some of the best artists I know just won't, I don't know, use Twitter or use a computer beyond making the tunes.
00:23:56.754 - 00:24:35.140, Speaker A: And I guess what I'm trying to do is just be an easy bridge to that. It's like, hey, there's someone doing this good thing or people not fearing it and making it as part of their day to day routine, like how they'll check Instagram. They would check in on this thing that's going on and see another kind of pipeline of artists apart from the people that they might be sharing festival bills with or sharing club night bills with, because there's so many. People that are creating great work, like as you said, but maybe not playing shows or already being platformed at a level, but in these communities they're already there making cool work.
00:24:36.070 - 00:25:31.000, Speaker B: Something that kind of just came to mind that actually wasn't kind of what I had prepped, but I'm kind of curious to get your take on it. Maybe Sirsu as well. I've noticed a lot of artists talking about sort of the pressure that's put on them, especially if they're in major label deals to produce massive amounts of content, right? And it's like the work of being an artist is not just the production of the artistry, it's the production of the marketing around it. And to Sirius's point earlier, a lot of stuff in Web Three does require this proactive engagement and this ability to get in the ring and stay in the ring. So I'm curious, from your point of view, are artists who kind of move into this space potentially replacing one burden with another? And if not, what's the real net benefit to them ultimately? Because they still have to do some extra work, right. But what's the potential gain for them there?
00:25:33.450 - 00:26:07.440, Speaker A: I think it's depth to me. I think people I've got to make 100 tunes instead of ten. It's like, no, it's like give an opportunity for people to understand the one tune or the two or three tunes that you're working on at a level that you might not do on Instagram or TikTok and really being open to exchange. This is maybe what I would have done. Or just having a conversation about things. Like, a lot of artists I work with, I guess they put out work in a way that isn't conversational. It's like, I'm excited to release my song, you listen.
00:26:07.440 - 00:26:42.060, Speaker A: Bye. And I think we're all getting so much more out of the exchange and a conversation and going back and forth and changing things and letting people obviously remix and play around of ideas, maybe take it out of a musical space. There's so much literally infinite possibilities when it's brought to the artist. But yeah, usually things aren't framed that way from the beginning and maybe that's not in their head, but I try and push people to let the art go and let it play around in spaces that they might not be familiar or comfortable with yet.
00:26:45.490 - 00:27:10.600, Speaker B: One question that I wanted to run by all of you, really. So I'll say the question and maybe throw it to one of you. I'm curious how in this space you square the difference between sort of the coproduction and co creation of culture and quality control. In other words, how do you maintain standards in a world where dows might be more prevalent, more and more people might be collaborating together for a certain end result? I'm going to throw it to Sirsu on this one first.
00:27:12.730 - 00:27:46.850, Speaker D: That's a great question. I think for me, it's like I approach it the same way I approach work art or just general life. Right. I know when people when they saw NFTs, a lot of people were like, oh, most of entities are garbage. And it's like, well, I mean, that's kind of to be expected, right? Before any of us become good at what we do. We do a lot of things wrong at first. We do a lot of things that we like, but it's not quite where we want it to be.
00:27:46.850 - 00:29:12.286, Speaker D: Right? And so there's always going to be this aspect of I don't necessarily use the word waste, but just this output that we generate that gets us closer and closer to our goal. If we all had the ability to do it the exact way that we wanted to, as perfect as we could the first time, I think we would have a completely different world that we'd be living in, but we don't. We're formed off of the mistakes that we make and and mistakes that are done publicly, at least in this kind of forum, allows other people to collectively find ways to help solve issues so that you can make a better choice in the future. And then also that can create a ripple effect for other people to make better choices. Doesn't necessarily always work like that, but that's sort of like me being optimistic. But I think the best way to engage or to at least try to formulate quality is always having a North Star. Like what's the thing? Or what are the aspects that are guiding you along your process? If we're talking about Dallas, for instance, are your core contributors, your main community also aligned in that? Because as you're all collectively figuring out what looks good or what's good to put out, then you can look at that North Star as your guide and say, well, is it hitting these things? And I think at a certain point in time, you even interrogate what the Nerf star is, because maybe you've hit that point and now you need to go somewhere else.
00:29:12.286 - 00:30:10.800, Speaker D: Maybe you've decided that we've tried this aspect and it doesn't necessarily work, so we need to figure out something else. Right? But it's always about having constant communication and developing alignment on where to move. And sometimes I'll even say this too, which is kind of counter to dows, but not really, that you don't need to rely on everyone to make a decision all the time. Right. There are certain things that require you to make a very snap decision, and you should feel again, that agency to do so and be okay because the community can back you, right? It's not necessarily just going and doing around Robin and asking every single person, are you okay with this decision? Are you okay with this decision? But knowing that everyone is aligned at least more in the meta context of what your overall mission is, that you have the freedom and the space to execute as you need to or as other people may need to.
00:30:13.010 - 00:30:18.900, Speaker B: Andrea, same question. How do you maintain the vision for she Said so as you start to wade into the world of web Three with it?
00:30:19.670 - 00:31:21.910, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I already kind of hinted at the fact that our community is pretty big at this point, and as the more you scale, the more difficult it is to keep those things in check within a Web Two kind of ecosystem, especially. And so for us, there are two layers of, I guess, curation. On one hand, we do curate our community to welcome people who share the same values with us. So, for example, if you're a white CIS woman and you want to join she Said So, you must demonstrate in some way that you understand intersectionality and that you come into this. Community with that understanding and you're navigating it, right? And you're occupying space in that way, very mindfully. Or yeah, if like me, I'm a white woman, CIS white woman, but I'm from Romania, Eastern Europe. As a result of that, I think I have different sensibilities towards other people's struggles.
00:31:21.910 - 00:32:28.220, Speaker C: And so that's pretty easy to do at the beginning, right? There are more or less different ways in which you can kind of introduce questions through the application process that help you identify that. We also created resources like our own intersectionality style guide, for example, that we push to people from the very beginning as they're trying to join our community for them to understand, oh, I need to spend 1520 minutes applying to become a member. I don't just have to pay for it, buy my way into, but I have to spend a lot of time digesting all this information and presenting myself to them. And so some people quit. Some people just don't even go through that process because they don't want to make the effort. And those aren't the people that we want in our community, but most people do make the effort. And then the second layer of curation for us is ultimately we are a community of music industry professionals, creators, artists and so on.
00:32:28.220 - 00:33:54.630, Speaker C: And there's a ton of music out there, and it's hard to make good music, right? It's hard to make good shit that you put out into the world. And most amazing things tend to have a ton of people behind them, right? Again, an example of how collaboration works best. So at that layer, that's where things get quite difficult within the web two space, because we want to be a community that's accessible to all, that promotes everyone as someone with potential. But at the same time, when it comes to creating music or putting out music projects, ultimately the ones that are better quality, whatever that means to different people, will ultimately emerge, at least in our community. In the real outside music industry world, things are still a little bit different, right? And so how do you manage that? How do you curate in a democratic way where the entire community is participating in that curation without having the web three tools? That's where I'm getting a little stuck. That's where it's still a bit more centralized, our community, from a curation perspective, ultimately, everything does get to me and the various other people who are part of my core team. And ultimately we make that decision.
00:33:54.630 - 00:34:29.700, Speaker C: And the way that those options trickle down to us, again, it's a very opaque kind of process, and I really wanted to make as transparent as possible so that we can truly give the chance to anyone in the community. Even if they're in a small village in Romania, they barely have Internet access. But if their art is really amazing, they don't need to have a huge network and huge social media following. They have, she said. So they have a place where they can put their art out, and there's a better chance for them at it being seen.
00:34:31.990 - 00:34:53.260, Speaker B: Izzy it's ten years from now. The floor on all refraction NFTs is like 500 ETH and ETH is at 10,000. How do you maintain a curatorial edge at that point when something pops off in the space and a lot of times its cultural value is somewhat intrinsically tied to its financial value?
00:34:54.990 - 00:35:04.960, Speaker E: Wow, that is a really hard question. I think that going back to.
00:35:08.850 - 00:35:09.166, Speaker D: Going.
00:35:09.188 - 00:36:33.382, Speaker E: Back to thinking about art and art, like art, is subjective. And the value that we place on it is subjective, whether it's because of the way that we appreciate its aesthetics or because of the fact that we're really driven by the financialization of it and the upside on buying something and making money on it. But I think having a values aligned team and values aligned community that has a shared understanding, whether it's through SOPs, like, standard operating procedures or a manifesto or a way or framework to think about what matters and why. It matters can, like other folks have said, serve as a North Star because it's kind of the same thing when things go up and when things go down, it's like it really shakes how people think about value and what matters. So I think having something to return to that's like, shared language, shared documentation, shared values that can serve as the grounding point whether something is up or down, would make sense to me. And I also think there's room for expertise always. Just because everyone is in a dow together doesn't mean that someone's actual experience and expertise in curation or producing or whatever should just become distributed to everyone.
00:36:33.382 - 00:36:50.990, Speaker E: It's like, I think we can trust people who have expertise in an area and lean on them when maybe it's not the best decision to ask every single member or to put it to a vote. I think there's definitely room for expertise.
00:36:52.530 - 00:37:11.830, Speaker B: Just to drill into that a little bit further. I'm curious because you have people with strong backgrounds and name brand experience. Have there been situations where even at that level, there have been clashes of personality or different POVs on who deserves a look from an event or not and how those things get handled?
00:37:15.770 - 00:38:28.160, Speaker E: I don't know if there's been necessarily clashing, but I think there's been maybe definitely different point of views about who to book for something or why. But I think ultimately everyone trusts each trusts each other enough. And I think maybe that's like the grounding point that ultimately, if someone feels really strongly about a decision and it's in their area of expertise, everyone is aligned enough to trust that person to make a decision. I mean, none of this is like life or death, like booking someone for a show. So I think a lot of it does come down to trust and a lot of conversation. Honestly, I think a lot of things just get worked out in long dialogues, and we have curatorial team meetings around, like, okay, what do we want to accomplish for this festival? What is the sound we're looking for? Who is within our community that might make sense? So a lot of it just gets hashed out in conversation in a really not, like, snapshot voting way, but just, like, real communication between people. Yeah, cool.
00:38:28.850 - 00:38:55.000, Speaker B: And Elijah, I'm curious for, again, the artists that you care about, the community that you work within. I think a lot about how technology has been always this core component and driver of the success and flourishing of a lot of artists in the Grime and UK drill space. I'm curious then, what would success look like for the artists that you work with as they enter the Web Three space? What do you want to see kind of the legacy become over the next few years?
00:38:57.390 - 00:40:00.422, Speaker A: Um, that's a hard question. I think more of us has been technically savvy and not fearing information, not fearing learning new things, not being intimidated by a lot of the jargon that you're kind of beating over the head with as you enter the space. So much of the language and kind of direction comes from the US. So here in the UK, we've just got different politics, different problems, different ways of looking at things. And I want people to just to feel, like, a kind of confidence and to be honest, just following on what for what everyone's saying about creating stuff. It's not the real win, but one of the wins. And kind of things I get people to focus on is like, did you have fun making this? Are we all having fun here when we're doing the Dows and putting together these crews and teams and labels and parties where we're doing it's like, this is supposed to be fun.
00:40:00.422 - 00:40:58.014, Speaker A: And I guess the moment it gets too analytical, technical, number goes up, number goes down, it's like, that's not what any of us got into this for. So the creative being fun to make, fun to share, like, fun to exchange, that being the driving core of what we do. My background is in pirate radio, and, I mean, the MCs won't say this, but I'm sure they loved turning up to MC. Pirate radio may well describe it that way, but why would they keep going back every week to just MC for free? It's because they loved it. Obviously. They thought it could get them somewhere and boost their name. But there was, like, a deep love for creating, and this space will test that for you, your love of creating and creation and all the kind of language and things that you have to go through to get there.
00:40:58.014 - 00:41:20.040, Speaker A: But if that can enable more and creating things that might not have been created without these mechanisms, then that's a strong thing. For the next 510 years. Like creating things that would have never existed. Obviously, tunes. The mandam always going to make tunes, but I don't know, like connecting with other people, other communities might not have happened.
00:41:20.890 - 00:41:21.640, Speaker D: Amazing.
00:41:22.090 - 00:41:33.130, Speaker B: Similar question to you, sir. Sue. Coming from a design background, working in the gaming space, et cetera, what's the end game for you and kind of your involvement in the Web Three space? What do you want to see flourish?
00:41:35.710 - 00:42:58.966, Speaker D: For me, I just want people to be true holders of their own path, right? My goal is if I can get one person to understand that things in life happen because they are walking in the direction for things to happen, that they're the co creator of the life that they live, that they lead, and they can take that and charge their own creativity, their own lives, whatever it is that they want to do. And if Web Three is the catalyst for that, if I can get one person to feel that, then that can be a ripple for other people. And I could tell you, as a designer, I worked in ad agency, I've worked in consumer products, healthcare, you name it. I was in every industry, at least for over a ten year span. And I never really felt like there was anything that was capturing me enough to go that extra mile and really embodied what I felt design could do as a catalyst or a tool for empowerment and agency. Until I found the web. Three space.
00:42:58.966 - 00:43:41.540, Speaker D: And since being a part of it and helping push artists through the Mint Fund, or being able to help gamers figure out that they can monetize their likeness in very unique and amazing ways with the power and tools of Web three, or to even inspire the aspects of what it means to be competitive or to engage in competition, I think all these things are endeavors that really help people discover. Themselves through this work and if so, allows them to live and lead healthier and better lives, whether both hopefully financially and also creatively too. That's really my end game, is to just get as many people on board with that as possible. Everything else is an added effect.
00:43:44.150 - 00:43:50.680, Speaker B: We've only got a couple of minutes left, so Izzy, Andrea, any closing thoughts before we wrap up?
00:43:56.530 - 00:44:42.800, Speaker C: I'm just excited, honestly. I know there's a bit of loom and doom out there on the music industry side. There is still a lot of resistance, I have to say, from a lot of people who are not willing to make the effort. It's scary, it's cammy out there, but I truly think it's the future of everything. The Web Three space will be the new Internet, and I'm so excited about all the ways in which we will be able to collaborate, both in terms of culture creation as well as how we govern ourselves as societies. That is the thing that will probably be a big game changer, and we'll probably take some time before we get there.
00:44:43.890 - 00:44:44.446, Speaker D: Cool.
00:44:44.548 - 00:44:58.830, Speaker B: Well, I'll just take this last minute to thank everyone for participating. Thank everyone for watching. You heard it here first. Dows kind of underrated, a little bit overrated because of the VCs technology. Kind of whack, but cool if you use it right? And if you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong.
00:44:58.980 - 00:44:59.420, Speaker D: Thanks, everybody.
