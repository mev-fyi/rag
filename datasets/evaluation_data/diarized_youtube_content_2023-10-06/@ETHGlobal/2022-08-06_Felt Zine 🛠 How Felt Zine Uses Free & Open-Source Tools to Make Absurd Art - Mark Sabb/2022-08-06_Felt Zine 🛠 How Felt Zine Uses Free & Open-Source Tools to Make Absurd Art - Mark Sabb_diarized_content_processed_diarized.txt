00:00:06.970 - 00:00:44.042, Speaker A: Alright. Hey, what's up? My name is Mark. I'm the founder of Felzine. Never really know how to do these things where I'm supposed to introduce, introduce myself or something. The thing that I am, you know. Okay, so this may or may not be another take because I realized you guys can see way too much information on the other one. Anyway, like I was saying, if you just check out our website, belzine us, feltzine us, you're going to see just a bunch of different art projects that we've done.
00:00:44.042 - 00:01:24.294, Speaker A: Everything from the latest news on our NFT collections to also artist collections and collaborations that we're doing, such as this one that aren't even necessarily NFT collections, but are just full collections of art that we're supporting and dropping. So check us out. Sometimes we got NFTs, sometimes we got, dope you know what I'm saying? Events for you all. Like this one that we collaborated with to bring you all, especially during NFT NYC. We've done events during Art Basel. Like I said, we're always dropping collections, trying to do cool, fun stuff. Whether it be in Web Three, whether it's just general internet art stuff, 3D art stuff.
00:01:24.294 - 00:02:11.480, Speaker A: We're always trying to just drop cool, interesting shit, at least shit that we think is interesting. If I click here at our top, you know what I'm saying, you can see our NFT art shop. And this for us is something that's really important. Obviously. Yeah, we are artists. We are creative, but we're also very big into people having independent ownership and the fact that Web Three is a really good opportunity and platform for artists such as us, hopefully creators who are also watching this tutorial right now, to really get into sort of thinking through their own means of ownership, their own means of dropping. So for us, having our own secondary market is really dope because it kind of just completes, I think, this cycle for us where we can drop art.
00:02:11.480 - 00:02:52.562, Speaker A: We drop art on our own contract, people mint them and then directly from our own contracts on our own minting pages, now they can live in their own secondary on our website. So it's really cool sort of being able to create this ecosystem of art for our collectors and for our community. So if you're a collector of any of these collections, and if you happen to collect any of our future collections, if you collected any of our one on one, I just of course want to say thank you. And if you're here because you're like, okay, Mark, shut up. I want to know how you make this stuff and not just talk about what you've done. Wait no longer. This is what we're getting into now.
00:02:52.562 - 00:03:29.870, Speaker A: I just sort of want to get into what we do, who we are, and just give some context. Some people know us for one thing, but they don't know us for the other. So like I said, check us out. Of course, all the NFTs that are found on our page here can also be found anywhere, right? They can be found on OpenSea, whatever, anywhere you're looking for NFTs, you can find our stuff. Of course. First tools that I want to tell you about is something called Pixelator. This is a tool that I think is pretty slept on, and actually, I really only found it recently.
00:03:29.870 - 00:04:24.270, Speaker A: This is a really dope tool. You can pay $25 if you want to go for the commercial version, but if you just want to use it out the back, there is a free version. And I think the free version is great. I do want to note before I sort of jump in to the tutorial that I'm using the full version. And for some of these programs, I did get lucky. I was able to maybe download them really early, and for some of them, I was able to get in before maybe they were charging, or I got an early version and was able to download and upgrade. But for a lot of these apps, even if you see that I'm using a certain version, please don't be afraid just to try out the free one and then purchase it if you feel like you need a certain feature.
00:04:24.270 - 00:05:16.402, Speaker A: But for all of these tools, you should be able to pretty much open them, use them, and create very high quality art, even up to literally like 4K dimension art or whatever. So just know that even if I show you some piece, even if I'm not using the exact version or the virgin number that might be available to the public, whatever, that does not mean that the one that's available to you isn't know with that. Like I said, you could find this at Pixelator. So there's two pixelators, actually. So make sure you get the one that's Pixelator by Ron Ness. And I'll make sure that when I load it up, you're able to find it and see it. I'll make sure that you get the right one.
00:05:16.402 - 00:05:41.994, Speaker A: But there is another app called Pixelator which I haven't used. So just make sure that when you go to download it, that your page looks like my page. If your page doesn't look like my page and you're opening it up soon, you might be using the wrong one. And then you also see the creator, Ron Ness, he's in the top right corner. So I would. Or Ronan, Ness. I don't know.
00:05:41.994 - 00:06:43.470, Speaker A: Whatever. I would just make sure just make sure that because I had that confusion. I also want to note that, as you can kind of see here, it says like, it all right. So as like you can see here, to support young devs, this app is free for anyone under 18. So, yeah, even if you're if you're under 18 and you want to use the commercial version, you can. So this is the kind of stuff that I just want to sort of stop and talk about because for me, I think that keep it real, you're going to get from the world what you attract. You know what I'm saying? And so if you're kind of working with people that are doing dope stuff such as this, going out of their way to make sure that young Devs can use their app in general, when it comes to open source, when it comes to web3, just try to surround yourself with people like that.
00:06:43.470 - 00:07:49.650, Speaker A: Try to use their application. Because if we support them and they actually get used, that's sort of like the biggest dopest type of resistance that we can do, right? If people create these free apps and then nobody uses them or people don't utilize them to make super dope art or make very impactful things the same way that we would use paid apps, then things are essentially going to stay the way that they are. People are going to continue to make sure that the best technology is always used in the context of whatever, of driving the most capital of whatever, exploiting the most people, right? And I think in order for us to get to a place where open source stuff is used more, we got to use open source stuff more, we got to use free apps more, and we got to definitely support people that are doing really dope things like making their apps totally free commercially for young aspiring devs. All right, so I'm going to jump in. I'm going to show you kind of how Pixelator works. I'm going to show you some stuff that I think is dope to do with it. As you see, you can make pixel art in seconds.
00:07:49.650 - 00:08:44.530, Speaker A: With things like Dali, with things like Mid Journey, just like the whole wave of AI, we're seeing a big embrace of tools that make art creation easier. So I think with that being the case, I'm a big fan of not just caring about the technology, but actually also caring about the thinking. What is the underlying philosophy behind why people are using these sort of tools? Right? So if we're going to be thinking about decentralization, we're going to be thinking about making sure all of our projects are open source. Let's do the same thing here. And if we're going to be thinking about using tools like AI, which make the process of art creation easier, then we should also do the same thing and use apps such as this, which make things like pixelating anything a thousand times easier. So I'm going to jump into that, let's try it out and let's see what we could create. I'm going to try to create something new on the spot with you all.
00:08:44.530 - 00:09:16.894, Speaker A: And so maybe I'll have a couple of flops. Maybe we'll make something dope and maybe we'll go through the whole process of making something that was dope and then you'll see it become whack and hopefully we could bring it back by the end. Who knows, maybe through this whole process we'll even make a piece. I don't want to stick to anything because like I said, if it turns out to be ash, we're going to abandon the piece because that's a part of our creation as well. So maybe what we're going to do is just make a bunch of ash and then we're not going to even post it or hear it. And we're going to be like, yo, that's the day of an artist. That's the day of a true artist wasting a shit ton of time.
00:09:16.894 - 00:09:36.878, Speaker A: All right, let's get into this. Okay, so you can see here we got Pixelator opened up. There's a couple of ways. You can add images. You can either drag and drop an image, or you could click where it says, like, source file. Either way works. I personally to drag and drop my image.
00:09:36.878 - 00:09:59.686, Speaker A: I can give you guys a quick rundown for just of the panel here. Just so you see. We got a couple of things happening here. You got this pixelation factor. This basically controls the size of the pix, basically the size of your average pixel or whatever, how much you're going to pixelate it, basically. So this is on a one. I tend to play with a lot of different styles, but one is cool.
00:09:59.686 - 00:10:32.950, Speaker A: But if I bumped it up to 50, you see what that looks like, you know what I'm saying? It kind of has a cool vibe, something you could work with. If you go down to like, let's see what like seven looks like, you can see, you know what I'm saying? It sort of has more of a little bit of whatever eight bit feel, whatever. I'm going to bump it up to one again because I think this works more for what I like to do artistically. But yeah, they all work. And I think all of them have especially when you get to the bigger sizes, they get a little bit more experimental, which is really cool in its own way too. All right, let's keep it pumping. Colors.
00:10:32.950 - 00:10:55.518, Speaker A: This piece is pretty simple. It's probably like not even eight colors in. You only see 1234. Yeah, there might only be four or something like that. Maybe like five or something like that. So not that many colors in this altogether. So I bet actually if I bumped it down to like five, I'll see if we see a difference.
00:10:55.518 - 00:11:36.170, Speaker A: Probably. I think with a lot of pixel art stuff, probably a good idea to have less colors as possible because that's kind of more true to the actual medium, in my opinion. If you're going to use a program like Pixelator, which is automating stuff, you should try to make your automated stuff look more like handmade stuff. And your handmade stuff is dope. If people came and believe you did it by hand, that's kind of like vibe I like to go with at least. So anyway, look, I just dropped to five colors and you see that it looks so weird now. So let's see what happens if we bump up to six.
00:11:36.170 - 00:12:05.538, Speaker A: It's interesting because eight just might be our sweet spot. So, like I said, try it out and mess with different things. If six doesn't look good, I'm not going to do seven. I'm just going to go back to eight. But I could even bump it up to like, I'll go to eight so that you all could see eight. And then even if I double it to 16, or if I go to even 256, you're going to see there's no major difference there. So, yeah, you see at six, we're starting to get the eyes recognized again, but here, boom, I'll go to eight just so that we remember what it used to look like.
00:12:05.538 - 00:12:21.174, Speaker A: So now eight just popped up. We're looking pretty dope. And yeah, so that's what eight looks like. So you got that settled there. Like I said, if I bump up to 256, you really want to see a difference, even when it stops loading. So that's cool. Your smoothing factor, you'll sort of see what that does.
00:12:21.174 - 00:12:36.974, Speaker A: That does interesting stuff. It tries to smooth things out. The interesting thing is sometimes that ends up sort of like knocking stuff out. Your smoothing factor. Your factor is sort of like how strong it's going to be. And then the iterations is like a multiplier of the smoothing factor. So I can show you what that looks like.
00:12:36.974 - 00:13:07.654, Speaker A: As you see, 256 colors doesn't look different from eight, especially not at this size, and probably the size that will be using something like this, especially given that it's pixel art. And even if it gets bigger, what's cool about Pixar is that this view stays consistent, basically stays the same. So that's, um, all right, so we have our smoothing factor in. I could kind of show you what this is going to do. I'm just going to max it out. All right, so we're waiting for that to go in background opacity. I know what that is.
00:13:07.654 - 00:13:18.086, Speaker A: Keep that high. I don't personally want my background. Outside outline type. You can have an outside line. I'm going to go to none. We really don't need one here. But you can have outside lines, inside lines.
00:13:18.086 - 00:13:54.038, Speaker A: You all know how all that goes. Size in, size out. This stuff gets really interesting when you start working in pixel art. So I think if you're really into pixel art and you want to get down into making stuff look more or less realistic, there's interesting things with size in and size out and the ways that different pixel artists think about side pixels and stuff like that. That's not what this is about. I'm not trying to get down like a pixel art rabbit hole, but some of that stuff is cool. If that's what this was about we could get into it.
00:13:54.038 - 00:14:21.920, Speaker A: And then, you know, you're saying you got your outline, color outline, opacities outline on change on color change. That's cool stuff. Basically, as colors change, it'll add a line. So where this, like, blue and white is, it'll put a line there. Same here. It just takes different color palettes of outline nodes, and then you could have, like, a diagonal outline rather than be thicker. And that's what I was talking about with the sides in, sides out, as, all that kind of stuff.
00:14:21.920 - 00:14:45.240, Speaker A: If we click palette outline here, we might actually end up seeing that sort of, like, divider line between the blue and the white of the eyes. Let's see now. We didn't get it this time. I mean, sometimes that happens. We probably bumped it up, played with these things a little bit more. Oh, actually, it's because I didn't have it. And let's see if we click inside line type if it comes up.
00:14:45.240 - 00:15:09.280, Speaker A: Yeah. So you see here, you know what I'm saying? Just play around with your settings, try different things out. I wasn't trying to script this or do anything that was, like, too camp. Like I said in the beginning, if we have experiences where we see certain things or we don't, it is what it is. See, it came up. I know what I'm talking about. I was trying to preface it like, but I'm good.
00:15:09.280 - 00:15:28.034, Speaker A: Need to start being such a scared of myself, scared of my own feeling. I know the truth. I know it's going to work, but I act like I ain't know it's going to work. Why is I against myself? Y'all see the line? Let's go back. Let's go back to it. Y'all see the line? I know what I'm doing with this app. All right, cool.
00:15:28.034 - 00:15:59.934, Speaker A: So look, man, that's kind of, like, my main point. I'm going to add the line here so that my bubbles is, like, a little different. You know what I'm saying? Got some individuality. Yeah, this is what I mean. I mean, you know what I'm saying? You just have the opportunity to do cool stuff, kind of switch it out. If I wanted to bump up, I could probably deep fry her, make her like a little snooky, little snooky bubbles. We could do that, you know what I'm saying? We could orange them out so good.
00:15:59.934 - 00:16:11.140, Speaker A: You know, I'm what saying? Mar a lago. Mar a lago. The homegirl. She had the blonde hair. This kind of fly. She had the blonde hair ready in the orange tan. All right, look, this is what we go do.
00:16:11.140 - 00:16:44.926, Speaker A: This is when this shit becomes fun again. And I think this is one thing I kind of want to also touch on. I think using a tool like Pixelator just allows you to have so much fun in a way that if I had tried to recreate that shit by hand, I don't think I would have just messed around and you know what I'm saying? Created the Mar a lago version of the homie here. So that's what I mean, man. Just have fun with the art. When we call our art absurd, that's what we mean. We're embracing got we got Ivanka bubbles, man.
00:16:44.926 - 00:17:05.474, Speaker A: You know what I'm saying? That in itself is amazing. So I just want to say that. I just think that, you know what I'm saying? Just have fun with this shit. And I'm having fun. This is like my favorite thing I've made in all the time. Okay, so I'm going to export this so we have it. I'm going to just save it to my desktop.
00:17:05.474 - 00:17:34.794, Speaker A: I saved the previous bubbles. I'm going to call this bubbles trump. Could we know what it says? All right, so there we go. This is fire. All right, where do we go from here? All right, so we got the orange person. Let me drop another one of these again so we could do this again. I'm going to give you an example of one that I did recently.
00:17:34.794 - 00:17:50.420, Speaker A: And then I'll show you how I used it in a piece. And then you can see sort of like I'm not bluffing you. I really do like tools. All right, let's drop this in. Boom. So we're copying in another one. We load this one up.
00:17:50.420 - 00:18:06.374, Speaker A: It's going to do its thing. Yeah. So you can see it gets kind of funky. This one obviously, I didn't want to saturation enhance this one. Think this one I might even kick down to zero. Zero is a little show with this one. Yeah, I might have kicked up a little.
00:18:06.374 - 00:18:28.766, Speaker A: Anyway, this is one I've already made this one. So I'm just going to get into that and then I'll show you what I ended up exporting and then show you how I ended up using. All right? Okay, dope. So now you can see the mickey that I created. And yes, I do have photoshop open. Whatever. I never said that every single thing I was going to use here was going to be free.
00:18:28.766 - 00:18:57.350, Speaker A: If you don't use Photoshop, then just use whatever free program you're already using to edit images. I know that you all have an editor that can open PNGs, okay? So don't beef with me about this. I didn't feel like finding a fake free alternative just to lie to you. I'm not going to do that. Okay, so here we go with Photoshop. You can see here's my pixelated mickey. Gosh.
00:18:57.350 - 00:19:07.690, Speaker A: Let me zoom into the homie here. All right, here we go. So as you can see here, he's pixelated. Whatever. He looks good. 100%. He looks good.
00:19:07.690 - 00:19:24.350, Speaker A: He looks good when he's smaller. Doesn't look great when he's bigger. Happens. Now what did I do with him? I placed him in here. Now what is this? This is a promo for one of our latest collection. It's also a piece I made. Sometimes I make pieces which can also serve as promos.
00:19:24.350 - 00:19:50.440, Speaker A: Pretty much just trying to stay efficient here, y'all trying to stay creative. At Web Three, you got to work smarter, not harder. We're all working too hard already, especially in these bear markets. You'll feel me? You know what we're doing here, you know what I'm saying? The bear markets. Yeah. You got too much time to just be making a lot of shit that's disconnected from everything else. All right, here we go.
00:19:50.440 - 00:20:14.594, Speaker A: Yeah, here we are. I mean, I used it, you know what I'm saying? I used it, I posted it. This was a part of promotion for everything that we did. You could see there are tools like Pixelator that are currently and always in my rotation of tools that I'm using. This was the focal point of the image. And what's really cool I didn't even plan this. The way this came together is so good.
00:20:14.594 - 00:20:50.662, Speaker A: I swear I couldn't have planned what's about to happen next. This background, this background, let's just strip everything off and I'm going layer by layer. Let's just take everything off layer by layer. Y'all are going to do this with me when we are left when we are left with nothing but the background. Nothing but this thing you see here, this was all made with artificial intelligence. Not the big famous one that you currently have to pay for. This is made with a free one which performs comparably.
00:20:50.662 - 00:21:35.802, Speaker A: I will note that by the time this comes out, there might be other types of AIS which also do a great job. So I don't want to say like, this one's the best, or another one's the best. This one is free. It will always be free because of the way that it is available. So I would just heavily just say, try this out this way that I'm about to show you how to make AI art is really useful. Even if you do have even if you do have an account on Dali, even if you were able to get an invitation, this is still useful because you could test out prompts the way that I'm about to show you. And then if that prompt works, then you can try it in Dali to get something else.
00:21:35.802 - 00:22:14.662, Speaker A: Like I said, it's not necessarily something that's better, but something that's different. And so I like to do that, especially because you have to pay for the Dali bunch and you can't kind of iterate on different ideas as much. This one also doesn't have anything that will get you banned. No one can ban you. My Web Three people, you know how important this is. If we were to talk about decentralization, then we're going to talk about some very interesting things when it comes to OpenAI and when it comes to these certain systems that people are building. I understand what they're afraid of, but are they afraid of us or should we be afraid of them? You all feel me? All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get this whole AI thing set up.
00:22:14.662 - 00:22:38.320, Speaker A: There's some background downloading that I got to do on my end that you all really don't want to see. And I'll probably just get it started just so you all could see what I do to make it happen. But truthfully, that stuff is very boring. You'll see, I'll get it started. I'm going to have to speed through that, and we're just going to go through it. We'll make some really cool AI, and yeah, then we'll see where we're landing. Okay.
00:22:38.320 - 00:23:20.986, Speaker A: The first thing I wanted to bring up, especially when it comes to the AI stuff, is that similar to Dolly, all of this can be done in the browser, really. I think the best way to kind of find this and approach especially the style and the process that I've been talking to you about that we're presenting is just to sort of go to this reddit. If you go to Reddit R BigSleep, you can find one of the main posts. There is the centipede diffusion notebook. Like I said, I have this post saved. This is, like, a really great post. I'm going to go ahead and upvote it.
00:23:20.986 - 00:24:03.542, Speaker A: I didn't believe I had it before, but whatever. I really don't use reddit like that besides once in a while to grab stuff like this. So, yeah, you can kind of learn everything you need to here. It kind of gives you the deep details into the different types of diffusions from latent diffusion and disco diffusion. This one piece, whatever you may or may not be impressed by that. That's not really my point. You'll kind of see, and there's a really big thread where people have added a bunch of things, asked a bunch of questions, and the Op has done a lot of really great work answering everybody and making us a really great collab notebook.
00:24:03.542 - 00:24:42.214, Speaker A: For people who don't know about collab, I'm going to click over here. This is the actual what we call a collab notebook. These collab notebooks are very similar to Python notebooks. Just like regular Python notebooks. Pretty sure that's what they are. So if you use something like jupyter to create NFTs or something like that, then you're probably actually familiar with something like this. For me, the first time I tried it, because I was familiar with using jupyter Python notebooks, I sort of caught on really quickly.
00:24:42.214 - 00:25:31.362, Speaker A: But I've also showed this to friends of mine who weren't familiar with Python, and they thought it was really easy to use as well. So I now show you an example, I guess, for anybody who doesn't have access, but it's not as easy as Dolly. It is harder than Dolly, but I think that it's still very easy. I mean, Dolly is just incredibly easy. If Dolly is a one out of ten on the Easiness scale, then I would say this is probably a five, so it's certainly not a ten. But I do think that because it does have these sections where you could just add in text. But for instance, it is important to keep these brackets and these quotes.
00:25:31.362 - 00:26:15.526, Speaker A: And if someone isn't really familiar with this world, I could see where they get caught up. However, if you read step by step and line by line, you should not make a mistake. And the other thing that I will say, especially because we're probably going to have to do some sort of like quick fast forward thing, I will say that the most important thing is these prompts. Yeah. And you can get into sort of like if you see here and you read the tutorial, you see some steps, you can be more detailed than other steps. I say try that out, try different things. Once you're used to this, once you get into the flow of things, we'll try different things out and you'll sort of see what it looks like.
00:26:15.526 - 00:27:17.382, Speaker A: But like I said, I think in general for me personally, this is the best tool, the best free AI generation tool that I found. As you'll see, you can create high quality images and by that what I mean is literally high resolution, high dimension, big file size, up to like I think I've been generating things here that are like ten megabytes plus easy, like not even stressing. Yeah. I do want to note that it says that you may require a Pro account. I don't find the Pro account to be necessary unless you start wanting to make videos and stuff like that, which I don't do. But once again, this is like a similar thing with Pixelator. If you want to support something like Collab, I think it could be a good thing.
00:27:17.382 - 00:27:46.830, Speaker A: I think that there are a lot of really good reasons why you should and you can. But if you don't want to, great. You know what I'm saying? That's dope. If you don't want to, you ain't got to do that you don't want to do. And if you can't, that's okay as well, you know what I'm saying? You shouldn't feel any shame around that. But just want to say that with all these things they are free and they are really great free resources. But at the same time, if you do pay, a lot of times things maybe just work faster.
00:27:46.830 - 00:28:25.198, Speaker A: Or you could create videos maybe a little bit smoother maybe with less needing to do less coding or something like that. Yeah, like I said, just look at things and figure out for you and your workload what makes sense for you. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to show you all how I usually would run one of these things. You can read this if you want. I know that I've generated over well over 1000 images in this thing. So I'm going to skip this for now.
00:28:25.198 - 00:28:38.674, Speaker A: There's credits in here that are cool. You could check that out. Okay. Change all tutorial. The tutorial is useful. I do think some of this stuff is outdated, and I think they mentioned it at the top. Yeah, the section below is outdated as a V two.
00:28:38.674 - 00:29:04.022, Speaker A: So things are updated. But I think it's also still helpful just to get a sense of what's what text prompts, image props. You just get a sense of what it is. All right, so are we out of here? Yeah, let's keep going. All right, so this set up, this is really important. You pretty much click play here, and it'll do what it needs to do. And so if I click that okay.
00:29:04.022 - 00:29:14.286, Speaker A: Yeah. So now I need to run anyway. It's going to tell me it's not authorized. I'm going to run it anyway. You see up here? It's going to auto connect. It is connecting, and we are waiting for it now. All right.
00:29:14.286 - 00:29:53.240, Speaker A: And now it is clicking. And that's going to you want to access my Google Drive? I'm going to let it access my Google Drive just because I have a big enough Google Drive to do it. And there's some really cool stuff you can do. Like it auto saves your images if you do it on Google Drive. And it saves the image model, which is what it uses to sort of like if you say, bring me up a painting of King Napoleon trampling king Caesar, whatever. Napoleon wasn't a king, but you feel what he made himself effort. Whatever.
00:29:53.240 - 00:30:32.966, Speaker A: Napoleon fighting Caesar. Painted in the style of DA Vinci. The model is what says, okay, who is DA Vinci? What was his painting like? Et cetera, et cetera. So what's cool is if you have that on your drive loaded, it makes these processes of loading it up and getting it out way easier and way faster. Like I said, I'm going to speed this up anyway, but just trust me. If you can connect your drive, do it. I didn't do it for a long time, and now I regret it.
00:30:32.966 - 00:31:12.882, Speaker A: It automatically saves your images. It's just so much better. It's just so much better. So if you have the ability to put it on Drive, do it. There's a lot of troubleshooting if anything goes wrong, and just do it. Like I said, I've had experiences where I had to do the troubleshooting, and I will say being on the other side of that is definitely worth it to just get on drive, maybe get a Collab Pro account. If you really feel like you're going to make a lot of AI art, the Collab Pro account and the Google Drive is probably cheaper than doing the dolly images, especially if you find yourself doing a lot.
00:31:12.882 - 00:31:41.498, Speaker A: I know a lot of people that know spent through even I did. I went through my first round of free credits a lot of people have done that, and now they're doing four images instead of six. With this, you can determine how many images you get per batch. And like I said, they're all free. So even if you only did one per batch, it doesn't matter because they're all free. So anyway, like I said, the setup is going to go on. I'm going to holler at you on the other side of this.
00:31:41.498 - 00:32:05.540, Speaker A: We're going to generate some cool AI stuff, and then I'm going to show you guys how I made that previous background that I showed you. All this background right here. I'm going to show you how I put this stuff together. And then I think once we have that up yeah, wait, hold on. Let me switch to it. Boom. That background right there.
00:32:05.540 - 00:32:39.214, Speaker A: I'm going to show you how we could get something that looks pretty close to this. I could probably even just go ahead and try to get I could probably put in a very similar prompt that I put in when I put this one in. And we could see if we could get something like really close to this again. That's always kind of fun to see if the AI can repeat itself and then also to see how the AI completely diverges from this. So I'm pretty sure I know what I put in there's. Some tricks, there's some secrets to my art that you're going to get as I put this in. So this is going to be fun.
00:32:39.214 - 00:33:04.566, Speaker A: If anybody actually well, I know a lot of people are, but any of my friends would actually sit and watch this, have fun with this because this is part of the sauce, so it'll be fun. I'll drop it in there and yeah, we'll go from there. So I'm going to let this model and all that stuff load up. As I mentioned, you can kind of see that there. Yeah, it's loading up. It's still cooking. The setup is going, just so you all see.
00:33:04.566 - 00:33:49.270, Speaker A: I'm going to show you something real quick. If I go down here to my diffusion and clip settings, this is the model that it'll download. These different things you can check they make them kind of more advanced, but I've seen you get better results. Sometimes they're more detailed and maybe they look like more realistic or something. But the problem with clicking all these is that when you go to make your image, it is very slow. And then sometimes when you go to do the final part, which is like I think it's the disco diffusion part. Yeah, when you go to do the disco diffusion part, sometimes you're not going to have enough Ram and enough memory to get it done.
00:33:49.270 - 00:34:21.822, Speaker A: So I would just say try it on what's here first. And if you actually find yourself running out of Ram, maybe unclick one of these and just try different things or unclick all of them and only try one. So you don't need all of these checked to get these done. You only actually need like, one. While this is running, you could even just go ahead and click that play button there so that you can get this running. And once all of these are finished, if you click here, it's like moving through. You see these are done.
00:34:21.822 - 00:34:48.482, Speaker A: Check marks here, stuff like that. Checkmark there. This is the one that's processing. And if you see there's a whole table of contents here as well. So you can see what you're going to do. Once this is done, then we can move on to putting in our prompts, checking things out, and we'll go ahead and do that and we'll have a lot of fun with that stuff. This is the stuff that preloaded that just happens whenever you open up the notebook.
00:34:48.482 - 00:35:25.650, Speaker A: So don't mind that. Yeah, so look, let's just see what happens. This is going to go we're going to say me back up and we're going to try to create that piece of background or low key, just pick whatever we like. And then I'm going to probably put like, bubbles on top of that background and then we're going to have a new piece made. And then if it looks like we still have a little bit of time left in this tutorial, then I'll go ahead and do I'll add like a 3D component in there so we could go ahead and cook that up. All right, see you soon. Peace.
00:35:25.650 - 00:35:41.542, Speaker A: Okay. It didn't really take too long. Thankfully, we're basically done. All the models are ready and we are at three. Latent decision part. This is where you want to go. This is where it gets lit.
00:35:41.542 - 00:35:58.000, Speaker A: This is when it gets fun. This is the basis. This is when you just start creating shit. So, yeah, let's go ahead and start doing that. Give me one SEC. Sorry about that. All right, so yeah, let's go ahead.
00:35:58.000 - 00:36:13.042, Speaker A: Let's get started. We're just going to erase this prompt. We don't need this one. Like I said, keep the quote and keep the brackets. You need them. So I think it's easier to keep it. This one I'm going to do.
00:36:13.042 - 00:36:37.818, Speaker A: So we're trying to create the piece that we saw earlier. So y'all that don't know, that is Waikiki Beach. That's a location. My wife and I lived in Waikiki Beach for like six months. It was a very beautiful time in our life. She was pregnant with our firstborn son who just turned one. So this is a very also, like sick time to be revisiting this right now.
00:36:37.818 - 00:36:57.938, Speaker A: All right, so here we go. So this is our first prompt. Steps is going to take 50 steps. Steps are basically like, how much is going to process it. If you do too many steps, it starts to become, I don't know, just not as interesting. So 50 steps is really cool. Too many steps, it just starts to iterate on itself and kind of just becomes a jumbled mess.
00:36:57.938 - 00:37:20.326, Speaker A: Some people like that aesthetic, but I feel like, I don't know, whatever. Like I said before, I try to make my AI not look like AI. And I like my art that I make personally, to feel like it's robotic. I don't know why. That's just how I like to get down with things. So I'm trying to show you all the way that I genuinely like to create. And then you all can just figure out whatever you all want to do.
00:37:20.326 - 00:37:32.874, Speaker A: I don't think it's better than anything else. It's just what I do. Iterations are three. I'm going to keep it real with you. I will keep most of this the same. The samples in parallel is three. So you basically get three for three.
00:37:32.874 - 00:37:58.258, Speaker A: You get nine pieces. When it's all said and done, you'll see what that looks like, the diversity scale. I actually like to play with this. If you feel like you're getting something that you like, you can go higher. That's like 10, 15, 20, whatever. That's cool because you get things that are more similar. But then if you go down, like, let's say to five or three, even seven and a half, you get things that are pretty different from each other, which I liked a lot.
00:37:58.258 - 00:38:25.022, Speaker A: The seed stuff, minus one, I would keep that the same. You'll get a random number and the not safe for work threshold, I'm going to just go ahead and put mine on one. If you put it on zero, then it'll stop you from getting anything that's not safe for work. If you put it on one, it doesn't seem to stop anything. Personally, I'm very against this whole thing around AI censorship that's happening. I don't know. I'm not even trying myself out there like that or trying to cause issues or nothing.
00:38:25.022 - 00:39:02.890, Speaker A: But my first two days on OpenAI and Dolly, I already got Strike. And I didn't mean to I don't think I was trying to make anything that was that bad or anything. But there are some pieces that I have that have artistic nudity in them. And I was trying to get variation made of those and I couldn't do that. So I would just be careful. If you have any type of nudity or raunchiness to what you're trying to create, sometimes things like Dolly will block you. And so I can't say enough about artists being able to create without being censored.
00:39:02.890 - 00:39:13.610, Speaker A: So, yeah, sorry I stopped there. I didn't even stop there. I could have ran this. Okay, so you press play. That's what's going to happen. This is the folder name. You can keep that the same.
00:39:13.610 - 00:39:26.578, Speaker A: As I said, as you start to mess with these things, you can tap in more and start to personalize it. It'll make a difference. So we're going to go ahead and boom. Let's click play. Let's run this late in the fusion. You just skip it there's in painting mode stuff. We're not going to get into that now.
00:39:26.578 - 00:39:53.862, Speaker A: So it'll start cooking. You see the C number pop up and now it'll start to get rolling. As you see, it moves pretty fast. It does this thing pretty well. The whole thing itself should maybe take a total of like 30 seconds. It looks like it's going to take. And yeah, look, you all basically, like I was saying, I really believe in something like this because of a lot of different reasons.
00:39:53.862 - 00:40:33.234, Speaker A: It's open source. You can see all the code. You could click right into the GitHub. I could copy it to drive so I could save it myself. And yeah, the fact that I could save this and freeze it as what it is, no one can ever take it away from me and just take it off the Internet like they can with something like Dolly. I think that that means a lot. And so I would just the same way with Web Three, where we talk about things such as independence, et cetera, we should follow that same dude with all of the means to our art creation.
00:40:33.234 - 00:41:12.322, Speaker A: So if you put up an NFT and yeah, the NFT is on IPFS or it's on chain, yeah, that's great. But if all your means of creation are controlled and can be taken away from you at any moment, then at its core, you still have the same issues that you had before, right? So as we know with AI, we don't always get things that we love. So I rolled the dice. I didn't love what I got, not getting a lot of stuff that looks like what I have before. So we might have to make some adjustments. Let's check out let's see what we do. We can kind of adjust like the prompt a little bit and see what happens.
00:41:12.322 - 00:41:58.754, Speaker A: So let's go ahead. Let's go up there and have some fun. All right, YTP. Okay, so here's the other thing about this, right? I bet you if I drop the iterations and I drop the parallels, let's see what happens if I go up in size here, because this one might also be in case of that needing to change. So let's see what happens. We're going to run these similar but I think this is also another really cool thing to see, like you see here that with something like centipede diffusion, just changing the dimensions of what you're doing at the latent diffusion part can give you drastically different results. So I'm excited for you to see that soon because yeah, let's see, let's see if they're even different.
00:41:58.754 - 00:42:30.446, Speaker A: You never know what you're going to get when you roll the dice with AI. So it'll be really fun. So, yeah, as you can see here, we're getting more of like this pattern type thing. So here, let's do this. I'm going to change the prompt a little bit. And then I feel like we're going to start to get something that starts to resemble I'm going to switch it to like, landscape photo just to see what comes in, just to see what we get. And yeah, I think we might start to land on something that we start to vibe with a little bit.
00:42:30.446 - 00:43:09.418, Speaker A: I'm going to adjust these back to what they were before. Three and 256 on the width and the height. Boom, boom. All right, so we're going to let this rock. I like that this move fast enough where we can do this together, because this is cool, you know what I'm saying? It's cool to be continuously rolling the dice with this as of and not knowing what we're going to get and doing it together, that's really cool. I feel like this is usually a pretty solitary experience. So to do it with you all and to get new stuff and look at that.
00:43:09.418 - 00:43:36.858, Speaker A: Look at that. We finally got what we wanted. This is where AI gets so, man, this proves my point. I love to say that. To me, the art of AI is in the prompt, right? Look at that. Just by adding landscape photo, we changed the whole vibe of everything that we got, and we finally got what we wanted. Now I don't even know which one.
00:43:36.858 - 00:44:06.794, Speaker A: I want to move on to the next step. I mean, we have so many good options. Five has like a Gnarly wave that's coming to destroy the city, you know what I'm saying? Number eight, this last one has a crazy vibe that had building that's similar to our last one. Number seven, the building in the distance like that super fly. Six, that feels like Diamond Head or something. Anyway, I love it. We're going to go with number four because I think it might do the most when we go to the next level.
00:44:06.794 - 00:44:20.638, Speaker A: But hey, look, let's go. You know what I'm saying? Under different circumstances, I would run this again. Run this again. Save some blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know what it is? We're skipping this step so I could just click play here. It's not going to do anything cool. That took a second.
00:44:20.638 - 00:44:39.590, Speaker A: Now we're here at our disco diffusion settings. As you can see here, y'all you can get way deeper. There's stuff to do. I'm going to show you another kind of dope secret and shortcut. A lot of times you could just copy your first prompt and bring that in. And like I said, you can get detailed. I'm not saying that this is the right way to do it.
00:44:39.590 - 00:45:00.090, Speaker A: Another way is the wrong way. I'm not getting into all that. All I'm trying to say is that I found really good results by essentially copying it. I've had really good results by getting more detailed, all that stuff. But in my opinion, if you want to just start off, copy your prompt, duplicate your prompt, here. Try it out. Start getting results that you like.
00:45:00.090 - 00:45:15.518, Speaker A: You'll see why these next steps are nice animation settings. By default, it's not going to animate extra settings. Keep these the same. Click play. Click through these next steps. Get to the steps you want to get to, to really see what you need. This same thing.
00:45:15.518 - 00:45:28.654, Speaker A: Click through. Keep it moving. When you get to the disco diffusion part, unclick this now, please. Don't skip this. This is what you want to make happen. Corrective? And painting, you don't need that. You had this where it says latent res index.
00:45:28.654 - 00:45:43.580, Speaker A: So this is where you need to reference your chart up here. Pick an image. Like I said, we could pick zero. That one was still, but we really want to pick four. You could pick several images. So let's say I wanted to make zero and four, as it tells you down here, whatever. You could do zero.
00:45:43.580 - 00:45:54.974, Speaker A: Yeah, you do zero, comma, four, whatever. Cool. That's not what we want. We only want to do four. You could add your own image. Pretty much. Basically, you open it here, drag it.
00:45:54.974 - 00:46:03.246, Speaker A: You could do, like, whatever, boom. Copy path. Copy path. Paste it. Boom, you're good. We're not going to do that today. We're not doing that right now.
00:46:03.246 - 00:46:23.430, Speaker A: Definitely do that another time. We'll have a lot of fun. All right, so I'm pressing play. We're running our disco diffusion. This, my people, takes a little longer. This is why I was kind of saying not only why I was saying, but why you saw me. You saw me earlier.
00:46:23.430 - 00:46:49.422, Speaker A: I didn't rush to this section. I rolling my dice up earlier at the latent diffusion stage. I would definitely suggest that run the latent diffusion. Run the latent diffusion. And then when you feel like you got ones that you like, then move to the disco diffusion, and then you'll save yourself a lot of time. As you can see, we're still running the disco diffusion. The disco diffusion, it's going to take a while.
00:46:49.422 - 00:47:21.062, Speaker A: It always takes longer than processing the latent diffusion part, but also with the other settings that we put in. What's cool is that you're going to see that the image is going to be like a really big file. I think this one's probably going to end up being, like, 1024. But like I said, you could push them out as big as, like, 4K. So just give that a shot. Like I said, you get good quality images. As you can see right now, it's going through a process of making the image.
00:47:21.062 - 00:47:44.194, Speaker A: It starts off here, and then it builds samples. It speeds through. It does its thing right now where maybe it'll take about, like, a minute and a half. I'll speed through this so you can get to the end result, and you can see popping. You can see what that looks like, right? Okay, here we go. Looks like we're all done. All right, let's check this out.
00:47:44.194 - 00:47:56.070, Speaker A: Let's check this out. Yeah. All right. So that's our whole output. This looks fire. That's basically it. We just made an AI background.
00:47:56.070 - 00:48:14.646, Speaker A: I'm loving it. We're going to use this to boot with our we're going to combine this with the Bubbles piece that we made. Ivanka bubbles. Aka. Bubbles. Mar a lago. We're going to throw her into the Waikiki vibes.
00:48:14.646 - 00:48:54.422, Speaker A: And then you know what? We're going to go ahead, we're going to add a 3D element to that and basically have everything that you need to make any type of digital art piece at this point. All right, so boom, let's go ahead and do that thing. Maybe we'll just kick to some random three C 3D stuff, put some of random together, and we'll just slap it all together and yeah, while the piece done, post it. Whatever we want to do from there. So all right, let's get into that. Hey, y'all. So as I alluded to, I just wanted to give you all the quick dive into some 3D stuff.
00:48:54.422 - 00:49:24.820, Speaker A: I really don't want to spend too much time here because it's definitely not a 3D tutorial. This is really more of like general throwing you into stuff. But a lot of times people ask me about how to get really dope looking, realistic 3D figures. And Das 3D is really sort of like the leading standard for that. And it's free. The cool thing about it is exactly that you get started, you could download basically, you register, you do everything you need. They drop their own NFTs and stuff, whatever.
00:49:24.820 - 00:49:58.538, Speaker A: I don't really know much about those. But all of this stuff that you see here, they have like a place where you can shop, buy models, buy cool clothes and stuff. And you could edit them and do really cool shit with them. Like these bandanas, you know what I'm saying? I could cop that, flip the texture out, made that a feline bandana or whatever. They do cool stuff there's. Also, for anybody who's interested, there is free stuff on here. I forget how to search for it or find it right off the top right now.
00:49:58.538 - 00:50:13.502, Speaker A: But you'll see, there's a lot of things that you buy on sale and stuff. But you don't need to buy anything to use dash. You can use it completely free. And the free stuff is good. Oh, here we go. Look, this whole free model section. Look at this.
00:50:13.502 - 00:50:37.910, Speaker A: All this cool stuff you get for free. Do whatever you want with it. Have a lot of fun. This is what's free this week. But yeah, there's always free stuff just sort of happening every week. But it's even cool that just like every week you're going to get however many ten different items that are completely free. So, yeah, check that out.
00:50:37.910 - 00:50:57.194, Speaker A: Das 3D. Very fun. You can very quickly, right off the bat, start making really dope stuff. Can I show you an example of that I'm going to right now. So let's get out of here. Close that out. Let's hop into Dazz, and I'm just going to make something random.
00:50:57.194 - 00:51:24.018, Speaker A: I have no idea what I'm going to make, what I'm going to do. Hopefully this turns out pretty decent. Then once I have this, I'm going to just throw it in with our bubbles, mar a lago and our background and see what we get. But it'll be fun anyway. We're making absurd art. We're not thinking about it too much. We're just going with the flow.
00:51:24.018 - 00:51:59.086, Speaker A: We're just building, we're just creating. And yeah, basically everything we've used so far has been free, has had a free option, and we have just been embracing all of those vibes. So, yeah, what I'm doing here is I'm just kind of, like playing around in Dazz. Like I said, this is really not meant to be a tutorial on how to use Dazz or how to make greedy art. So I'm just going to kind of click around and just tell you some of the cool stuff that I like. I'm just going to put random stuff together. I'm saying, like, we have the ski mask.
00:51:59.086 - 00:52:08.206, Speaker A: Why not? So ski mask on the homie. Let's see what happens. Yeah. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Whatever. I'm not liking it's looking funky. Let's keep it moving.
00:52:08.206 - 00:52:27.686, Speaker A: This is the kind of stuff we do. You all I don't get too caught up in, like, if something doesn't work, I take it off. Right, let's see. Do we have wings? We do. Do we have them for Genesis? We do. This is going to work out perfect. So now look at that.
00:52:27.686 - 00:52:47.986, Speaker A: We have wings. Those look fly. It like I said, I'm not going to stress, go crazy about a lot of this. We know we're just having fun. We know we're just kind of vibing and putting stuff together. So that's exactly what we're going to do. We're not going to stress too much.
00:52:47.986 - 00:53:24.894, Speaker A: We're just going to explore this shit and see what we come up with. Shaping. This is where a lot of fun stuff happens if we go back to Genesis. Shaping you can get into a lot of you see here sort of on our right side, we got all these cool features that come with these cool little icons that come up, kind of tell you what you're going to do as you get into these other ones. There's other stuff here you can see if I zoom into the face part, you could see I was impacting that. You see what I'm saying? So all these do something like that. So we're going to go back to the ones that we had there before.
00:53:24.894 - 00:53:42.782, Speaker A: We're going to see what we could pull up. That'll be kind of interesting. I'm going to buff Homie out and we're just going to go super absurd here. We're going to buff our dude up and should be all right. Here we go. Let's zoom out. If we zoom out a bit, we see our homies.
00:53:42.782 - 00:54:03.820, Speaker A: A monster. It's a beast. All right, lit. So, like, yo, let's go over here. I'm going to drop in some business and materials. I'm really trying to not try to make this as fun as possible. I don't want to have to do enough speed through this shit because I just don't want to.
00:54:03.820 - 00:54:28.914, Speaker A: So I'm trying to make it here so that we could get some good stuff without needing to do too much. I'm going to just make this like I'm going to make him all gold. That gold is going to look janky when I pull it out, but freaking crazy. That's going to look janky, but now it's going to look good. Metal silver. Let's just get a random posing here. All this stuff.
00:54:28.914 - 00:54:46.838, Speaker A: As you see, I'm moving quickly. This is a combination of me being very familiar with dash three e. But also that dash three is kind of this easy. It kind of is like, I'm just going to pull this pose. And now he does that. Pull this pose. Now he does that.
00:54:46.838 - 00:55:05.158, Speaker A: But now I'm like, wait, my wings aren't sticking. So I got to parent my wings. Let's change the wing parent. The wing parent is Genesis, except that I don't know if I have to do that. Let's see if we move it. Now. I have my hand on go back to Genesis.
00:55:05.158 - 00:55:22.740, Speaker A: Let's do this. Now the wings are following. All right, what do we want to do? I don't like any of these poses. I'm gonna have to do more with the wings. I know, but we'll get back to that. All those poses are actual. Let's see what else we got.
00:55:22.740 - 00:55:59.790, Speaker A: Ah, let me parent this again. Let's replace these wings because these wings are not being nice. I also don't like that pose. That was ridiculous. All right. He's pretty strong with us running his hand. He's a beast.
00:55:59.790 - 00:56:26.326, Speaker A: All these are so, like, ridiculous, and I'm going to have to do this ridiculous pose. All right. It's fine. We're not going to do much. I just have to do this ridiculous pose. This is a lot of what making the art feels like. All right, let's go.
00:56:26.326 - 00:56:59.614, Speaker A: I'm double clicking this. All right, we're good. Our wings are in there. Am I going to pose the wings? Sure. I'm going to just crawl them in, and we're going to call it a day. Like I said, this is not too too much about trying to do something that's like 3D stuff. We're really just trying to we're really just trying to get something made here and just and just share and just try to show you all honestly, man, I'm trying to empower trying to show you how easy it is to make some shit.
00:56:59.614 - 00:57:21.318, Speaker A: So the last thing I'm trying to do is get caught up in something. I'm going to show you. I'm going to. Zoom out. I'm going to get the full body. Getting the full body is going to be way easier when we go in and we add this and we add it to the piece, mostly because if I crop it in, as soon as I crop it in, I'm so limited into what I can do with it. So I'm going to keep it one by one.
00:57:21.318 - 00:57:42.206, Speaker A: I'm going to keep the full body. In a lot of circumstances, I would say keep the full body and just upscale the piece and just crop it if you need to. I'll give you an idea of what I mean. This is probably a good trick. I'm going through with this, and the tricks are getting better as I talk to you. So this is awesome. All right, so we're just going to push this out.
00:57:42.206 - 00:57:56.898, Speaker A: I'm actually going to pump this. So this is, like, 1080. Now I'm going to do like, 4K on it. Hopefully it doesn't take, like, forever, forever to render. So I'll just do still image current frame. Now save it to a file. I don't need it there.
00:57:56.898 - 00:58:21.360, Speaker A: Definitely don't want I'm just going to save it directly to the desktop. It's not the best thing to do, but I just want to make this piece and then be good. So let's just do this big. Oh, this is great. Now we now we're here. We're putting the pieces together. I can say this much.
00:58:21.360 - 00:58:35.380, Speaker A: We deliver. Okay. We said we were going to make sure art. Here we are. First things first, we started strong. All right, so let's look at our first element here. Looking beautiful.
00:58:35.380 - 00:58:54.134, Speaker A: Really? All we're going to do right now is put the three elements together. We're going to put this piece together. Okay? Our pixel art that we created, we got the 3D homie that we just rendered. You film me? Oh, yeah. I didn't see that. But we irate the thing. You film me? We irate it.
00:58:54.134 - 00:59:09.286, Speaker A: We took it to the top. We did the damn thing with it. So I'm very excited about this. Okay, that's one element. What's our last one? Here we go, baby. Here we go. Our background, our background.
00:59:09.286 - 00:59:27.202, Speaker A: Our AI background is lit. We know that. We know we're running into Waikiki Beach. You know what I'm saying? Hieronymous bosch vibes. I'm excited. All right, so let's just put these things together. Okay.
00:59:27.202 - 00:59:47.000, Speaker A: We got our girl Bubbles. Bubbles is tanning the beach. Sorry, apologies there. Grabbed the wrong element. Right, here we go. She's chilling on the beach. Can I perspective? Let's see.
00:59:47.000 - 01:00:30.710, Speaker A: I don't know if we get here. I'm cool with the perspective stuff, you know, like, oh, no, that's all right, y'all. This is great already. You know, we're gonna do with our homie. Give me a little bit off here. I feel like yeah, look, our God. Our god is emerging from the sea.
01:00:30.710 - 01:01:08.690, Speaker A: Look at that. Look at that. Already. I love this piece. I love this piece. What it's in for now? If we really wanted to get funky with it, we could open up like a GPT-3, right? And we could even see what it would look like to potentially get some AI text, you know what I'm saying? Cooking in there. I don't even have one of those set up or anything like that yet.
01:01:08.690 - 01:01:32.330, Speaker A: But I'm just saying there's so much we could do with this. I can't wait to post this. I'm going to post this. Once we actually share our once we actually share that we're doing this and then this whole thing comes out, I'm going to be like, here's our piece. We might even mint this. This is sick. And if you want to know something about that, that's really dope, in my opinion.
01:01:32.330 - 01:02:24.906, Speaker A: I hope you all are as excited about this as I am, but everything that I showed you, all we have practically seriously put into play. And so I will give you all a look here. Hey, guys, really quickly, as we wrap up here, I just wanted to just let you know that everything that we did today was actually utilized in the Felzin's latest collection, the Garden of Felzene's Delight. So check that out when you see here, these elements were made in the 3D programs, similar free programs, similar ones to the ones that I showed you all. And then as you see, these backgrounds were made and using the exact AI process that I also outlined. So you can see that's one that we showed out in a little bit. You can see another example here.
01:02:24.906 - 01:03:00.194, Speaker A: So, yeah, definitely check that out. I just wanted to show you that all the same things that went together to put together the piece that we just made together, it's also here. And these are the same elements that we use to put together active collections that we currently have available on our website and that people are collecting, that people have supported. So get out there. Success to open source and free programs. And long live the creators. You all just good luck.
01:03:00.194 - 01:03:12.290, Speaker A: Please feel free to reach out. You can find us at Feltzine. F-E-L-T-Z-I-N-E-M-E. Personally. And you can find me at M-A-R-K. My name is Mark At. Mark digital.
01:03:12.290 - 01:03:21.610, Speaker A: D-I-G-I-T-A-L-H-D well, I hope you enjoyed this. I hope to do this more. This has been really fun. And I'll see you all later. Peace.
