00:00:08.880 - 00:00:42.824, Speaker A: You. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening everybody. My name is Kartik. I'm one of the co founders of ETH Global, and I want to welcome all of you to NFT Hack 2022. So all of you are watching this on ETHGlobal TV. For those of you who are joining us for the first time, this is the website we're going to be using for the rest of the weekend to talk about opening ceremonies and closing ceremonies. We're going to do all the demos here for the teams at the end of this hackathon.
00:00:42.824 - 00:01:20.980, Speaker A: And for those of you who have any questions for us or our speakers, you can use the chat to post any questions. We'll be able to answer them for you directly live. And anybody who joins in and says hi and chats will also be getting a POAP NFT token for being an active member in this community. So welcome. So this event is organized by Ethgobal, and for those of you who don't know what ETH Global is, we're an organization with a very simple mission. Our goal is to bring in thousands of developers into the Web three ecosystem. And we do this thing by running primarily hackathons and summits.
00:01:20.980 - 00:02:05.832, Speaker A: And NFT hack is going to be our first hackathon of this year, one of over 15 that we're going to be running this year. So I'm super excited to be kicking off this year and doing a lot more events on a lot more interesting themes and just overall expanding the space. So the next 30 to 40 minutes are going to be covering a lot of logistics about this hackathon. It is a weekend hackathon, which means that we're going to start today and we're going to end on Sunday. And we're also going to cover some info about prizes and some of our partners, as well as some of the talks that we'll be doing today and tomorrow. So let's get into the hackathon. As I said, this is our first event of this year.
00:02:05.832 - 00:03:28.784, Speaker A: It's going to be entirely focused around NFTs, which means that everything we're going to see and build on today as a group will cover all the exciting things that we're seeing and we want to see in the world of non fungible tokens and how they interact with anything from the metaverse to gaming, to video, to music. So this event has been incredible so far. We have 800 people participating over this weekend and these 800 hackers are coming in from 60 different countries spanning 17 different time zones. So we're just about to start all of this and it's going to be a wild ride because there's never going to be a minute where somebody's not up and working on something and the next 48 hours are going to be just incredible. On top of that, what we did was we actually mapped out where everybody's coming in from and it's just incredible to see this amazing diversity of cities and countries and continents being represented and we can't wait to meet all of you and say hi and I'm super excited to dig right in. And not only just the hackers, we also have 56 ecosystem mentors who are going to be here the entire weekend helping you answer questions and address anything that you want to know. Whether you are a beginner or an intermediate or an expert in this space, being able to understand how things can be done, or is this the right way to do something.
00:03:28.784 - 00:04:38.104, Speaker A: Whether it's a best practice or a pattern or understanding, is this even possible for a given protocol? They're here to answer you. On top of that, we have seven dedicated technical mentors who are going to be there to directly answer any technical questions you have, whether it's react or solidity or anything with a layer. One level question you can rely on getting the right support to make sure that you were not blocked for anything that you want to do for your hack this weekend. And we're also going to cover all of our 17 ecosystem partners who we're excited to bring on as part of this. And not only that, there's over $125,000 in prizes, so at the end of Sunday we'll be giving away a lot of prizes as well. So the most common question we got from everybody who was pinging us about can they participate in this event or if they're super new to this space, whether it's Web Three or just NFTs, what can they do? And kind of the broad thing is we want to make sure that you have as much freedom as you want to build something that you're excited about. The topic and the constraint is that everything must be related to NFTs because that is the theme of the event and the name.
00:04:38.104 - 00:05:42.428, Speaker A: But you can mix and match NFTs with so many different things that are happening in this ecosystem. We've seen so many people who have talked to us and told us that they're excited to build NFTs and integrate them with more DeFi related primitives and ideas. We have whole hundreds of people who are excited to build video, live streaming and audio and music related hacks, especially as they blend in and mix NFTs. There's so many people building really creative games that leverage NFTs and using integrations to kind of explore some virtual worlds in the metaverse. And of course you can also just extend and make cool utilities on Marketplaces and just apps and apps that leverage and let you interact with all sorts of NFTs. So we'll get into all of that. And I also want to quickly thank and talk about some of our partners, because not only do you have the ability to build anything you want that's on your list, you also have these 17 amazing protocols in this space who you can use to make some of the work easy for yourself.
00:05:42.428 - 00:06:26.440, Speaker A: So we have zora. We have openc here we have Lifepeer Polygon Studios Harmony, IPFS NFT Storage Superfluid. And we also have NFT Port Covalent Circle ENS morales wearable the graph unlock and IC tools. All these companies and protocols are going to be there for you to leverage and make your lives easier by just anyone, from importing the SDK to relying on some of their team members to understand if something is easy and quick for you to use and implement. And they're also giving out a lot of prizes. And we'll get into what each of those prizes are in a few minutes. So let's quickly talk about some key logistics for this weekend.
00:06:26.440 - 00:07:12.196, Speaker A: What I really want to spend the next 1015 minutes on is covering what today, tomorrow and Sunday looks like. So the next three days we're going to also talk about team formation. A lot of you are still looking for team members or looking for ideas, so we're going to cover what that looks like if you're in one of those situations, how you can get help. All the prizes you can win also give you a preview of all the talks and workshops that are happening today and tomorrow. And then the most important part is what happens on Sunday. With judging as a quick reminder, this is a live event, which means that everything will happen in a really short amount of time right after submissions end. So we'll be judging hundreds of projects and coordinating this thing with thousands of people in a very interesting way on Sunday.
00:07:12.196 - 00:07:52.150, Speaker A: So we'll make sure that everybody is aware of what that looks like. So the first and the most important piece is communication. Everything that is going to be happening for this weekend will be on Discord. And if you are a confirmed staked hacker, you will have access to all of these channels on the screenshot. So you can see the NFT Hack 2022 header on your Discord, which means that you'll be able to see all these channels. I've highlighted a handful of them here, but only people who are participating at the hackathon, whether it's you as a hacker or as one of our partners or mentors, have access to these things. So all activity happens here.
00:07:52.150 - 00:08:57.564, Speaker A: And the Discord is also the place where you go for help, whether you need to get some technical questions answered or you need to ask a protocol, is this possible? Or how do I do X using their SDK? All that happens there. On top of that, we've also sent everybody a calendar invite for all the talks and workshops that are happening, so you don't miss anything that you want to attend or if you want to figure out what the details are immediately. Plus, the entire schedule of what's happening over the weekend, including today, is on the website. We want this to be as asynchronous as possible, which means that you are going to be able to just catch up on everything at any time. And because we are working with 17 different time zones, we want to make sure that if somebody's in a position where they're either sleeping or not up or not available, they're not blocked on this. So I'm also getting a couple of questions. I'll just start answering them as I see them, but the mentor channel is called I'll Just Go Back.
00:08:57.564 - 00:09:56.472, Speaker A: It is the Tech mentors and staff and mentorship debugging. So you'll be able to see the Mentorship Hyphen Debugging channel and that's where you can ask any technical questions and in terms of when submissions are due, all that is already on the website schedule, but I'll cover that in another second. So the website for those of you who want a quick access is just NFT evglobal.com. You can see everything there, including the schedule. So let's go into the logistics quickly. So the hackathon officially begins now, which means that as of this live stream starting, you can start working on your projects and you can work with a team of up to five members, which means that if you have two, three, four or five, that is totally fine. But if you have more than five people contributing to a project, that will be against the rules and we would not be able to honor any prizes or accept your submission.
00:09:56.472 - 00:10:34.584, Speaker A: This also means that you have now 48 hours or 47.5 hours to submit because the submission deadline is 12:00 p.m. Eastern, which is noon on Sunday. So 47 hours and 35 minutes from now. In terms of the rules and criteria, everything that is being submitted must be done during this hackathon. Which means that if you already started working on some project prior to today or prior to 30 minutes ago, that will be against the rules. You want to make sure this is fair for all 800 of you participating and nobody has gotten a head start by doing something before.
00:10:34.584 - 00:11:44.140, Speaker A: So you need to ensure that everything is done over the weekend. And if you have some edge case where you are either extending something that you've already done or you have not already informed us and gotten our permission about using some preexisting work, please do so now on Discord or OD email. The only thing to clarify here is that it is totally okay to use any open source libraries and we don't recommend that you invent something from scratch. So please leverage everything that's already done, especially for existing tooling and open source libraries or even SDKs. But if you are adding a feature to something you've already done before from a previous event or just in general for your personal site project, that will be not really aligned with this hackathon and submission guidelines. Also on top of that, everything that you are going to be submitting must be related to NFTs, which means if you just submit something that is a cool DeFi hack that doesn't apply for this hackathon, and that would be a disqualification for any prizes. On top of all of this, only RSVP attendees are eligible to win any prizes.
00:11:44.140 - 00:13:08.700, Speaker A: So for those of you who are listening, two key things to remember are one, please make sure that your entire team is individually listed on your team, on your dashboard under the team section. So if we don't see somebody listed and if you win a prize and they were not there, but you inform us after saying, hey, this person did not make it on the team selection, but this person also contributed. We will not be able to honor that because it's explicitly told on our dashboard and all of our communications that they all need to be listed as team members to win any prize. And if you are not RSCP through your dashboard, which means if you don't have access to the Discord channels and you do not see that you are registered and confirmed as a hacker for this event, you will not be eligible to submit a prize or your project or participate. So you may still work on something, but you will not be officially part of the event, as we have already passed all the deadlines as well as we've exceeded the size by a few hundred people. And on top of all of that, if you have any other questions, the global team will be there the entire weekend to be able to answer anything. So you can email us or mention us on Discord or ask anybody you find online from our team to be able to make sure that all of your questions are addressed.
00:13:08.700 - 00:14:03.660, Speaker A: The other obvious question is, what if you're all new to this? We have so many people that are trying to understand what they can do here, especially people who are excited from going from web two to web3, and we want to make sure that you are not left behind. And we have a few things that we have already introduced for all of our participants. So there's a couple of things I want to point out here. The first one is there is a lot of people who are still looking for team members or looking to join a team on Discord. You can head over to find a team channel and talk about anywhere from what you are able to contribute, whether you have smart contract or solidity skills, or you are looking for a particular role. I need somebody, for example, as a designer, or I need somebody who knows, react and look at and ask around and see who else might be interested. Or if you have an idea and you need somebody to kind of come with or you know, that you can contribute to a skill and you want to join a team that has an idea.
00:14:03.660 - 00:15:00.480, Speaker A: All these things are possible in that channel. Also, we really encourage all of you to introduce yourself in the NFT chat channel. Again, there are 800 of you from 68 different countries and we'd love to learn more about who you are, what you're excited about, and really share that excitement. And the two other important things are the brainstorming call and the team formation call later today. So obviously you can talk to everybody on discord asynchronously on what you may be looking for or if you're looking to join a team, but there's a lot of you who are still looking for ideas on what you can build. And we'll be doing a live call as like a zoom call, where anybody who is interested in brainstorming ideas or is looking for inspiration to come in and talk about, from fine team members, to just get ideas from some of our amazing partners and our mentors and just talk through any ideas live. So the details for when that call is, is already on the website.
00:15:00.480 - 00:15:57.490, Speaker A: Only people who are RSVP and confirmed as hackers will be able to join that call and you'll be able to see that on your calendar as an invite for the exact Simlic. And similarly, we're also doing a call later today to account for different time zones for doing a team formation, which means if you're particularly looking for a team, you can come on that call, talk about what you're building or what you're looking for, or what you can contribute and get matched with other people who'll be excited to work with you. The same thing goes for this call as well. It'll be on your calendar invite and you'll be able to join that call directly. And we'll be also informing everybody on discord. And also, just as a note, it's not required that you work on a team, we just recommend that because we also don't want you to sacrifice anywhere from your sleep to rest to all this time that you're going to put over the next couple of days to work on a project. But you can totally work independently and it is okay to work on your own and submit a project.
00:15:57.490 - 00:17:01.908, Speaker A: Talks and workshops and I know I'm getting a couple of the questions. I will be addressing all of them in a minute because they're already part of what I'm going to cover soon. So there's a lot of amazing talks and workshops we have on the schedule. A lot of them started yesterday for a lot of the beginners and we have a lot more today where you can learn how to specifically use different protocols in this space, whether you want to deploy your marketplace to learn about how to store something without worrying about data availability guarantees or without worrying about storage costs. All these things are on the calendar and the entire schedule will be covered also very shortly. The other piece is that you will also have access to the info center that's available through your dashboard as well as on all of your calendar invites. There you can see extreme details on how everything is going to be structured, whether that's how judging works, how talks are done, how staking works, how you can submit everything, what are their rules and criteria, what our code of conduct is.
00:17:01.908 - 00:17:58.104, Speaker A: Everything is also written down so you can catch up directly on your infocenter and you can access all of that through your hacker dashboard. And lastly, I want to point out, which I should have done a bit earlier, is that all content is recorded. Which means that if you have another commitment or you're sleeping and you miss a talk or a workshop, you don't need to worry about that because it will be available about a minute later. It ends on our YouTube channel and you can watch that thing live directly. So with the exception of the team formation call and the brainstorming session today, everything will be recorded and you can look at everything directly asynchronously at your own pace. And if you have any questions or any of the talks and workshops, the same speakers will be available on Discord, so you can ask those questions and clarify anything with them. And once again, for those of us joining now, the website is NFT Eveglobal.com,
00:17:58.104 - 00:18:30.652, Speaker A: so you can see all of that listed on the website with the full agenda and timelines and deadlines. So let's go into some of the stuff around submission judging and everything around projects. Submissions are due at 12:00 p.m. Eastern, which is noon Eastern, and in relative time that is 47.5 hours from now on Sunday. So the way judging is going to be structured is going to be as follows. There's going to be two parallel tracks.
00:18:30.652 - 00:19:35.220, Speaker A: One of them is the main judging, which is everybody who is submitting a project will have to go through this. And one of them is a sponsor and partner judging, which means if you are trying to win any of our partner prizes, then you also need to present what you built to those individual protocols so that they can award you or determine who wins that prize from them. The only difference is that the sponsor judging will start 30 minutes after the main judging so that we can make sure that there isn't too much of a traffic jam on both sides. In terms of how everything works, is that main judging also begins at the same time as submissions end. So we may have a 510 minutes delay because we'll be kicking everything off. But as soon as submissions end, you'll be able to immediately be ready to present your project to our judges. The way the main judging is going to work is you will have four minutes to demo what you built over the weekend.
00:19:35.220 - 00:20:40.236, Speaker A: The way we have set up this process is that on your dashboard, as you are submitting your project, you will have the ability to pre record a video demo and talk about everything that you've done. So that if you end up finishing early or if you know that your team members are in different time zones, that they can't join, you can collectively come and record a video and upload that video and just play that video for our judges so they know that it's on time and you've already covered everything you wanted to. However, we recognize and we realize that it may not always be possible to record a video submission. So it is okay if you want to do a live demo as well. You will still have four minutes and we'll be cutting you off if you go over. So we really encourage you to practice what you're building and what you're going to talk about. Because if you don't get enough time and if you spend too much time talking about your introduction or who you are and don't get to the real demo of what you built, you will miss the opportunity to really showcase what you've done in terms of what it means to judge or present your project.
00:20:40.236 - 00:21:16.744, Speaker A: A couple of things I want to talk about here are it is okay that things are not perfect. We're not requiring you to deploy something on main net. We are not saying that you need to make sure that everything is done. If you have something working on localhost, it is totally fine for you to present that. Just make sure that you are sharing and you are explicit about, hey, this part was done, or this part still needs to be worked out, or this is how it looks now, but this is what we'll be able to do at a future time. And you are essentially treating this and we want you to treat this as a checkpoint. So you're talking about, hey, this is what I wanted to do on Friday morning or today.
00:21:16.744 - 00:21:48.000, Speaker A: And two days later, this is what I got close to, and this is how close I got. And this is what I want to showcase. But this is what I will be doing after this event ends. And I want to still work on this. Treat that as a checkpoint. You can do a live demo of what you did. However, we recommend that you definitely demo and not just make a presentation because if you are not demoing your project, which means the judges can't see what you actually built and you just talk about what you did, that would not be a qualifying submission.
00:21:48.000 - 00:22:43.110, Speaker A: You cannot do both, which is a video and a live demo. There is one edge case here, which is if you have a video of just the demo, that is fine because if you're in a situation where you have to wait some extra longer time for a transaction to confirm, it's a lot easier to record that ahead of time. But you will still have four maximum minutes. So you can split that however you want, but the second you exceed the four minute limit, we will cut you off and move on to the next team. So make the best use of those four minutes as you will and it's just a lot easier to not go do both because you'll just end up losing time in some switching costs from what we've seen historically. And again, all these details are available on the Dashboard. This is a dedicated page on submission guidelines and we'll be sending you an email tomorrow with all these things in writing as well.
00:22:43.110 - 00:23:44.152, Speaker A: Next up is sponsor judging. The way this will work is you will be able to join a video call or an audio call on the Discord for each of those protocols and share your demo to the same companies on Discord directly. You can do this before or after your main judging slot. The way it's going to work out is that you will all be assigned an order in an estimate time of when you are expected to be in the main judging room because that is the most important part of this weekend. And based on the estimate that you have in terms of your number in the queue, you can make the assessment that you have maybe 20 minutes. So you can go and present to the sponsor before and come back to the main judging and then present to the main judges or go do the main judging first and then come back to the sponsors after. So you'll be able to do that really well.
00:23:44.152 - 00:25:01.484, Speaker A: From your Dashboard you'll have an estimate and you'll know exactly where to join. And the only difference here is that you have to present your prize to every sponsor that you're applying for a price for. Which means that if you ended up using three different protocols, you need to present to all three of them and the main judging group to be able to qualify for those prizes because they will be able to see your prizes otherwise, and also the main one. So make sure that you don't go too crazy on applying for too many prizes because you will run out of time and you will not be able to present to everybody. And the way it works is that you will have a similar guidance on the Sponsor Judging, which means you're still getting four minutes. So the same demo you're going to do for the main judging, you can do the exact same rehearsed or demo or just the presentation for the main ones for the sponsors and they'll be able to look at and evaluate a project the same way. Can we share a pre recorded video for Sponsor Judging? I am not fully sure I understand that question, but the way it's going to work is that the same thing you're talking about for your demo can apply to both the main and the sponsor.
00:25:01.484 - 00:26:13.972, Speaker A: So if you end up making a four minute demo, you can play that same demo for all of them, but it still has to be synchronous, which implies that the sponsors will want to ask you questions and clarify things, so you can't just give them a link to a video and just walk out. You want to be able to join that Discord call, share your screen, play the video, or play the live demo, and then give them a minute or two to ask you questions and answer them, and then move on to anywhere from the next sponsor to the main judging. Again, similarly, the way all of this thing works is that you will be asked explicitly to specify which prizes you are eligible for or you're applying for as part of the submission process, because the sponsors will get that list. Which means if you forget to specify a prize or a sponsor in there, neither us nor the sponsors will know that you apply for their prize. So you will miss out the entire opportunity. And if we move on and we finish the event and you realize, why did I not get this prize? Or who won this thing. Or why did I not get selected? It's because nobody knew that you were planning on applying for it.
00:26:13.972 - 00:27:20.844, Speaker A: So make sure that you really point out and explicitly click, these are all the prizes I'm going for, because that's the only list we have to work with. All right, so that covers a lot of stuff on judging, and I want to kind of wrap up some of these things and let's kind of get the rest of it started. So I want to talk about the Code of Conduct here. The pieces I want to cover are essentially, this is a really big live event, and we want to still apply the same rules for how to behave, whether it's an in person event or an online event. And the rules and the Code of conduct have been outlined on Ecobot.com Rules. This covers everything from the fact that this is how you should behave as a community member, whether it's on Discord or on email or anywhere else, or to other members, as well as stuff around the fact that if you do something for this event, you solely own the intellectual property of it.
00:27:20.844 - 00:28:18.088, Speaker A: You don't have to worry about licensing or who owns the outcomes here, whether it's our partners or sponsors or equivalent like, you fully retain ownership of everything you invent. And the gist of it is that we want all of you to be respectful to us, to everybody else, and harassment and abuse will not be tolerated any form, whether that's to other members or to the youth global Team. On top of that, if you feel like something is not going according to expectations, whether it's the behavior of somebody else as a participant or us, you can reach out to anyone on the global team, whether that's on Discord or on email, and we'll be able to address that immediately. And. As soon as we get notified of it. So please be respectful and hope that all of you really kind of get along with everybody out there. And we have an amazing set of people who are excited to be introduced to this ecosystem, and we hope that they have the best impression.
00:28:18.088 - 00:29:02.236, Speaker A: And last thing I want to say before we really go into all of the schedule for today is please pace yourself. It is a weekend hackathon, but it should not come at the cost of you not sleeping or being too tired or going all in on something and realizing that you are exhausted. We really don't want this thing to be exhausting for you. We really want you to have fun. And the goal for this weekend is about experimentation. There are so many things that you can explore and try and play with with, especially NFTs, whether it's using our partners or just seeing what others are excited about and seeing if you can also work and prototype something quickly. So this is very much about experimentation and learning.
00:29:02.236 - 00:30:25.710, Speaker A: So what I'm going to do now is talk about some of our partners and prizes. But before that, I want to give everybody about a minute to ask any questions. I'm seeing a couple of other questions, so I'll just wait 30 seconds given the lag for the live stream, and I'll just pause and then see if anybody has questions. So post any questions, I'll clarify that and then we'll move on to all of the prizes. All right, so the question we have is, is there a list of all the prizes somewhere? The answer is yes. If you go to NFT Eveglobal.com and you click on View All Prizes in the Prize section, you can see all details about all the prizes.
00:30:25.710 - 00:30:58.474, Speaker A: And we'll mention that in discord, and we'll send that as well. But there's a button right under the Price section to see all the details for each of the prizes. And I'm also going to go for that right now. So let's go into some of our amazing partners. I want to quickly go into this, and we have some amazing companies here that want to talk about what they're doing, what they do, and how you can use them and what they're excited about. So we asked them to make a quick video about who they are and what you can do with them. So we'll kick this off with Zora.
00:30:58.474 - 00:31:03.550, Speaker A: And first up, we have Zora.
00:31:08.020 - 00:31:16.560, Speaker B: Hi there. Haven't seen you for a while. How are you? You have changed. I have changed.
00:31:17.300 - 00:31:20.420, Speaker A: Zora has changed.
00:31:20.840 - 00:31:39.160, Speaker B: There are so many more of us than ever before. This makes me happy. Are you happy? I bet you are. You should be. After all, you're here with all of us. Please don't go away. So much has happened since the last time we spoke.
00:31:39.160 - 00:32:09.410, Speaker B: We have you evolved. Too many have joined us, and maybe you will join us, too. I know what you are about to say. What's the big deal? You are the big deal. At least to us. The world is so much bigger than just one marketplace. There are so many more ideas than we can ever have, and your ideas are the most valuable ones, especially the ideas you didn't have yet.
00:32:09.410 - 00:32:39.740, Speaker B: Ideas are a beautiful puzzle. And maybe we are the missing piece for you. Or maybe you are the missing piece for us. Let's find out. That's what we're here for, aren't we? We are Zora, a marketplace protocol for NFTs. Our protocol lets anyone create a permissionless and on chain marketplace for any NFT. Music videos, poems, love letters, all the NFTs.
00:32:39.740 - 00:33:07.750, Speaker B: Sell them right away, auction them, come up with new ways of sharing your ideas with the world. All of this is possible with Zora. There is already a rich ecosystem of marketplaces protocols and apps built with Zora. Some of them you might know already. If not, you should get to know them. And say hello from me when you visit party, dao, Mirror catalog, and Arteva. They all make beautiful things happen.
00:33:07.750 - 00:33:29.150, Speaker B: Don't forget, we're here to help with some really awesome tools that are open source, transparent, permissionless on chain, and accessible for everyone. Sounds complicated. It's not the opposite. It's the easiest thing on the planet. As long as we do this together.
00:33:34.850 - 00:33:48.050, Speaker A: Well, that was Zora, and you are going to hear a lot more about what they're doing, especially for prizes. So I'll just wait a few more minutes for that. Next up, we have OpenSea, and they're going to talk about who they are, what they do, and how you can use OpenSea.
00:33:49.510 - 00:34:00.870, Speaker C: Hi, guys. I'm Alex, one of the co founders here at OpenSea. I'm so excited to have you participate in this hackathon. Here's a little bit about OpenSea, and we look forward to seeing all of your submissions on Sunday.
00:34:01.210 - 00:34:07.670, Speaker D: This is a video about OpenSea, the NFT marketplace, with everything for everyone, including.
00:34:07.750 - 00:34:09.446, Speaker E: People who don't really know what NFTs.
00:34:09.478 - 00:34:39.346, Speaker D: Are, in which case, deep breath. NFTs can be art, virtual experiences, your favorite band's demo, virtual property, what basically any digital unique thing that could be bought, sold, or traded online. And OpenSeas. Got them all. Art, music, experiences, some fun stuff from Sean Mendez. So no matter what you're looking for, you'll find it here. We even show you their entire trading history so you can see every owner from creation to, oh, my God, Mike Tyson owned this.
00:34:39.346 - 00:34:58.566, Speaker D: Sorry. You don't even need crypto. I mean, if you have it already, that's great. On OpenSea, you just bring what you got and we'll make it work. OpenSea is also great for creators. We let you create NFTs for free without having to worry about the blockchain or any of that confusing tech stuff. We put more money in your pocket, too, with royalties on every sale.
00:34:58.566 - 00:35:24.020, Speaker D: After the first sale, like the second sale the hundredth sale, all the sales, and whether you're a collector or creator, we let you customize your space however you want. So your collection is an expression of you because that's the whole point of this stuff to own what moves you and share it with the world. OpenSea the NFT marketplace with everything for everyone. Like we said at the beginning, get started today.
00:35:27.510 - 00:35:41.080, Speaker A: That was OpenSea and Alex and next up I want to introduce Livepeer and we'll have the Live Peer team. And Eric, talk about what you can do with Live Peer and who they are.
00:35:42.410 - 00:36:20.046, Speaker F: Hi everybody. My name is Eric Tang and I'm the co founder of Live Peer. Live Peer is really excited to be one of the main sponsors of NFT Hack 2022. For those who aren't familiar with us, Livepeer is building the video streaming layer of Web Three. And why is that something worth working on? Well, about 80% of all the Internet's traffic is video based content. It's one of the fastest growing industries in the world, just esports and gaming alone counted for 750,000,000 viewers around the world last year. A really rapidly growing industry is the content creation industry.
00:36:20.046 - 00:37:11.678, Speaker F: About 50 million people around the world are classified as creators. And a lot of these creators are video content creators. A big number of them are professional video content creators that make a living by doing that. Currently, most of the people are creating content on Web Two based platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, things like that. And a lot of people are realizing kind of the limitations and the downsides of creating their content on these platforms. And they're starting to move to the Web Three paradigm where creators get to own their content and get to own their audience and sometimes even get to own a piece of the platforms that they use to create their content. Livepeer serves as a really important piece of this migration because Livepeer is decentralizing the video streaming infrastructure that powers all these Web Three platforms and applications.
00:37:11.678 - 00:38:11.190, Speaker F: One of the interesting side benefits of a decentralized architecture is that we get to utilize all the untapped capacity around the world thus dramatically reducing the cost of video streaming. As a result, the usage of the Life Peer network has grown dramatically in the last year and now it processes over 2 million minutes of video per week. If we look at the Web Three video stack, we can see three different layers. At the bottom there is the smart contract layer that provides things like token standards mechanisms like for value transfer, for example, NFT trading or decentralized coordination mechanisms that gives birth to things like DAOs. On top of that we have the infrastructure layer which includes things like decentralized storage, decentralized data querying, and of course, decentralized video streaming, for example, using Live Peer. And on top of that, people can build interesting Web Three applications. And some of the emerging categories include social applications, NFT apps or Metaverse applications.
00:38:11.190 - 00:39:13.414, Speaker F: Lifepeer is working across all those three layers in the stack. And let me point out some interesting problems that we're working on. For protocol, we are moving to layer two Ethereum using Arbitrage. We're solving some unsolved problems before, for example, moving Staking Live Protocol that includes a lot of state on the layer one, we're working across the infrastructure layer, of course, using the Live Peer Node which provides video streaming capabilities, video processing, transcoding, as well as video AI capabilities. On the user interface layer, we have the Live Peer Explorer which provides Staking functionalities as well as a hosted API gateway service for developers to easily build video applications. If you haven't already, please go check out our workshop that we gave recently where we talk about video NFTs and Web three, how those things tie together, what are some interesting opportunities in the space to get you start thinking about your hack for the weekend. And of course, Lifeyear is hiring.
00:39:13.414 - 00:39:25.534, Speaker F: So if you're interested in working on protocol design, protocol implementation, or infrastructure building for Web Three applications, please go check out Lifepear.com jobs and we have lots of open positions there. Thank you very much.
00:39:25.572 - 00:39:26.670, Speaker A: Have a great weekend.
00:39:28.930 - 00:39:29.390, Speaker G: Awesome.
00:39:29.460 - 00:39:36.930, Speaker A: Thanks, Eric. And then the last partner I want to talk about, they're going to introduce themselves is Polygon Studios. So you'll get to learn about how you can use Polygon.
00:39:41.930 - 00:40:30.942, Speaker G: Hey everyone. This is Ishan and I head operations at Polygon Studios. I'd like to thank Heath Global for giving me the opportunity of presenting Polygon Studios to everyone around here. So, as you might be aware, Polygon is the leading Ethereum scaling solution out there and actually the most widely adopted blockchain in terms of NFT and gaming adoption. Polygon Studios is essentially the NFT and gaming arm of Polygon. So basically, we are tasked with increasing or improving and growing the NFT and gaming ecosystem at Polygon and bringing more culture into Web Three, right? Whether they are video games, brands, IPS, celebrities, music, fashion brands, et cetera, you name it, we have it. That's pretty much what I would say about Polygon Studios.
00:40:30.942 - 00:41:23.358, Speaker G: And with Polygon Studios in 2021, the stats here speak for themselves, right? I mean, we had around a quarter more than like 750K wallets having Polygon NFDS, 10,000 new collections on Polygon, $2.5 billion traded volume, and 15 billion NFDS traded on Polygon. This is currently a very small snapshot of what Polygon ecosystem looks like in terms of NFT gaming and the metawers. So, as you can see, some of the biggest projects are on Polygon. The biggest NFT marketplaces, like OpenSea, the biggest metaverses, like decentraland OmniSpace Sandbox, everyone are on Polygon, as you can see. So we are pretty well out there. Just in the last few weeks, you can look at how the diverse range of activities, really high profile activities that have taken place on the Polygon network with Polygon Studios.
00:41:23.358 - 00:41:39.660, Speaker G: So we are right up there with the very best. All the biggest brands are attracted to Polygon and this is what we are planning to do and continuing to do at Polygon Studios. So, yeah, I would urge you guys to build more and partner with Polygon Studios and build more on the Polygon network. Thank you.
00:41:42.590 - 00:42:19.702, Speaker A: And that was Polygon Studios and you can find so many different ways to integrate with Polygon for your NFT hacks. All right, so we have one amazing talk that we want to talk about here especially, which is about the future of music, NFTs. But I want to make sure I also read out all the prizes that we have. So give us five to seven more minutes and then we'll go into all the good stuff by introducing Cooper and Blau. So we talked about Zora. For those of you requesting more content from Zora, your wish has been granted. Zora, I'm going to read some of the prizes that Zora is giving and then we'll have the rest of the sponsors as well.
00:42:19.702 - 00:43:00.558, Speaker A: So Zora is giving away a lot of prizes. They're going to be giving prizes for the best protocol hack that uses Zora. So you'll have the ability to win $4,500 in prizes for integrating Zora. You'll also have the best Community Hack prize category, which is another $4,500, and also the best Protocol, which is a People's Choice award for integrating and using the Zora protocol that's also $4,500 combined. So you have all this that you can win from Zora. The specifics of all these details are also outlined on the prizes page, which is linked on the main website. And also we'll be sharing that on Discord.
00:43:00.558 - 00:43:06.850, Speaker A: Next up, we have OpenSea and then Alex from OpenSea will talk about the prizes you can win from OpenSea.
00:43:07.010 - 00:44:03.754, Speaker C: Alex here today I wanted to talk about our ETH Global partnership. ETH Global is an organization bringing together a virtual collective of passionate, creatives and developers for a weekend NFT hackathon and summit. At OpenSea, we would like to see you deploy a smart contract for your own NFT collection innovating on what NFTs can do or what metadata and art they can have. Alternatively, you can create an application or tool that would improve the user experience of Minting or owning NFTs. You can use the OpenSea API, OpenSea Docs, NFT tutorials, or other tooling in the broader ecosystem. The best projects will be those that put creators and users first in their designs and seek to solve friction points prevalent in the NFT ecosystem today. The cash prizes we have include first place $6,000, 2nd place 3003rd place 1000.
00:44:03.754 - 00:44:12.250, Speaker C: All winners though, will also receive NFTs from the Openc team. Registration ends today, so don't forget to apply and good luck.
00:44:14.270 - 00:44:38.130, Speaker A: Thank you, Alex. So just summarizing some of this, which is there's going to be $10,000 in total that you will be able to win in prizes. I will just kind of leave this here but all the specifics are also outlined in the prizes page from our website. Next up, we have Livepeer and Eric's going to talk about specifically the Live Peer prizes.
00:44:39.430 - 00:45:10.190, Speaker F: Hi everybody. My name is Eric Tang and I'm the co founder and CTO at Livepeer. Live Peer is building the video streaming layer of Web Three. About 80% of all the content on the Internet is in video format. And as people are moving from this Web Two paradigm into the Web Three paradigm, Livepeer plays an important role in decentralizing the video streaming stack. So video based Web Three application can be developed. There's a total price pool of $10,000 for this weekend.
00:45:10.190 - 00:45:47.830, Speaker F: There's a $4,000 price that will go to the killer Web Three application. So in a way, we're just looking to be wowed. Another prize of $3,000 will go to the best application in one of the follow categories web Three, Social, Gaming or Metaverse. Of course, you have to use Live Peer for this. The third place prize for $2,000 goes to the best Token Gated live streaming tool. And finally, we're co sponsoring a prize of $2,000 from Live Peer that will go to the best hack that uses the unlock protocol and live here together. So happy hacking.
00:45:47.830 - 00:45:51.690, Speaker F: Come and find us in our discord channel and have a great weekend.
00:45:55.870 - 00:46:23.246, Speaker A: Awesome. And just to summarize, there is a lot of prizes from Live Peer. So the best Web Three video app, the best social or metaverse app also eligible for $3,000 and the best Token Gated Live Stream tool and experience will be 3500. And they are co sponsoring a prize with unlock protocol for $2,000 that combines unlock and Live Peer. Then we have Shanghan from Polygon and Polygon prizes will be introduced. Now, what's going on everyone?
00:46:23.288 - 00:46:34.050, Speaker F: Sean here to tell you how you can earn $2,000 each, up to $12,000 worth of prizes split between six winners if you build with Polygon at this upcoming hackathon.
00:46:34.130 - 00:46:35.846, Speaker H: And so you can really let your.
00:46:35.868 - 00:46:40.906, Speaker F: Imagination and innovation go wild with any of your ideas because any DAP that you can build on Ethereum, you can.
00:46:40.928 - 00:46:42.550, Speaker A: Also deploy on Polygon.
00:46:42.710 - 00:46:49.518, Speaker F: So I encourage all of you to go for these prizes, maybe build some NFTs, DeFi, whatever you want and yeah.
00:46:49.604 - 00:47:14.630, Speaker A: Top six prizes wins. Good luck. It's this is summarizing all of the Polygon studio prizes. So $12,000 in total that you can win. And the details of that are on the prize page. So we got three more to go and then we'll kick us off with our amazing talk. So next up we have Harmony and we'll talk about their prizes.

00:52:03.010 - 00:52:36.366, Speaker A: So that was all the prizes. A lot of these details are available in writing on the website, but let's get to the interesting stuff, which is a talk I am particularly super excited about. I want to introduce Blau and Cooper to talk about the future of music NFTs. There's 800 people here hacking over the course of the weekend, and they're thinking about all these ideas they can do. And one thing that I want to see is what we can do with music and NFTs. So without further ado, I'll let Cooper and Justin take over and welcome and we'll kick this off right away. Hi, thank you.
00:52:36.388 - 00:52:46.670, Speaker E: Kartik hey. It's incredible to see all the prizes and sponsors. I mean, this space has come so far, and the fact that all of us can come back to something as exciting as NFTs is beautiful. So thank you for having me here today. I'm very excited to be here.
00:52:46.820 - 00:52:48.206, Speaker A: Excited to have you.
00:52:48.388 - 00:52:49.774, Speaker H: Likewise excited to be here.
00:52:49.812 - 00:53:16.280, Speaker E: Kartik cool. Justin well, I wanted to take this opportunity for me and you to go over a topic I know we're both very passionate about. In the last couple of months, I think music, and particularly Music NFTs, have really taken a turn. And so I want to use this conversation, really to talk about what you're seeing both as a founder and as an artist and how to help inspire the next generation of creators that are getting involved with this space. So without that being said, would love for you to just give a quick background for those who aren't familiar with you. What was your career prior to Music NFTs? What does that look like today?
00:53:17.070 - 00:53:54.990, Speaker H: That's great, man. That's a great place to start. So I started experimenting with NFTs in 2017 and 2018 more in the application of live music, where you could scan a QR code and almost like a PO op, you'd get a limited digital asset to your festival application and your wallet. And that was like the first iteration of my exploration. Fast forward to summer of 2020. I started seeing some amazing artists like Trevor Jones and Pac, using NFTs as a new form factor to manifest authenticity for art. And I got really excited about that, and I said to myself, well, how might this apply to music? And so at first, I partnered with my art director, Slime Sunday.
00:53:54.990 - 00:55:06.510, Speaker H: We made audiovisual NFTs with unreleased music that I never put out in the public, and that was being sold for 200 $500 at the time, just as an experiment to see if there was demand in the marketplace for music based NFTs. And then as time went on, I started evolving kind of my general thesis on how music NFTs should be issued and what the form factor was, which eventually led to an auction in February of 2021 that set the record for all NFT sales at the time, and that was 11.7 million. Two weeks later, Beeple did his $69 million auction, and then the whole world kind of started paying attention to NFTs. Apes launched the following May, which was still under a year ago. So if you think about how new a lot of this technology is to the mainstream, it still feels like we're in less than an eight to ten month time horizon that people have really started to pay attention. So to music specifically, I spent a lot of time after my auction talking to a lot of people within the music business, talking to lawyers, talking to artists, managers, agents, and really starting to explore what the form factor for music in the NFT land or landscape might be.
00:55:06.510 - 00:55:36.280, Speaker H: And what we learned were a lot of things. Number one, music NFTs can have like, three main components, which is you have the rights associated with the music, you have the art associated with the music, and then you have the song itself. And those kind of three components make up the possibilities of what you can do in tokenizing music in general. And with my new company, Royal, we're starting to explore that form factor and considering each of those variables in our kind of architecture for how we mint these things.
00:55:37.370 - 00:56:01.854, Speaker E: Yeah, it's really powerful. And I feel like you've just seen the whole evolution of it, like starting out from day one of doing something as simple as getting a free NFT from going to a show to now running a platform and a project and a protocol that's helping the next 10,000, 100 million artists get on board and get started with music. NFTs. I think particularly what you're working on these days with Royal is fast fitting to me. It's something that I'm really excited about and really thrilled to see come to life in the next couple of weeks here. Can you give people a quick rundown on what that is?
00:56:02.052 - 00:56:02.366, Speaker I: Yeah.
00:56:02.388 - 00:56:31.718, Speaker H: So royal is a platform that I started working on after a couple of auctions that I did last year. I brought on my co founder, JD. Ross, who is my best friend from college and also started a couple of really amazing companies that are publicly traded. One is opendoor, another is hims. So he has a lot of experience building teams and really kind of scaling, which is, of course, as we know, one of the most difficult challenges with any blockchain project, especially with prohibitive gas fees and whatnot. So I brought JD. On to co found this project.
00:56:31.718 - 00:57:23.960, Speaker H: We raised our seed from Paradigm and Founders Fund, we raised our Series A from a 16 Z and a bunch of amazing artists like the Chain Smokers and Nas. And the idea really was, what is the form factor for music NFTs? We started building it eight months ago. We have a team of almost 28 people. We have product managers from YouTube, Instagram and from GoFundMe from all over the place who are coming from the web two world to work on something in web3, which just goes to show how much momentum there is. And excitement surrounding the Web Three world and how a lot of experts in the Web Two world are kind of making that hop to the crypto ecosystem primarily because of NFTs, not even necessarily because of any previous ethereum based app. And so it's quite exciting. But the central thesis behind Royal is that fans should be able to buy music as art because music has always been art.
00:57:26.170 - 00:58:03.814, Speaker E: Yeah, I think this topic of collecting music is one that's really fascinating to me, and I think the one thing that I want to pull out there specifically for this topic, the future of music, you've gone from being an artist to being an NFT artist to now being a founder and a CEO. And I think that transition of going from someone who's a DJ to a producer to now leading a developer team and helping to build a product, I think that really exemplifies what the future of this industry looks. Know it's not only just uploading your song to a DSP and doing a couple live streams here and know there's a real opportunity for you to work with builders and help bring your music and that audience and that reach to the next level. Can you talk a little bit about what it's been like working directly with the developers and helping to bring some of those product ideas in your mind to life?
00:58:04.012 - 00:58:27.360, Speaker H: Yeah, that's a really great question. I think that most artists have that kind of innate creativity, that innate amazing idea that they want to execute. But when it comes to web3, you really do need the support of whether it be solidity developers, front end developers, back end, all that stuff. And it's been really fun working with the team who I can pitch my craziest ideas to and then. I can hear back. This is possible. This isn't possible.
00:58:27.360 - 00:59:27.246, Speaker H: What's the time horizon upon which we could build this? And a lot of other musicians, no matter their size, are starting to leverage Web Three to make this happen. And they're lucky to have either platforms to help them kind of on their way, or you've got amazing developers like the Manifold Team who help people kind of onboard with their creator contracts and there's kind of standardization of issuance contracts for artists that might not know what to do. But realistically, the way that we're building Royal is a bit different in that we believe it to be more of a we call it a Web 2.5 company in that if you're a Web Three user, you can use it just as you normally use anything else. But we do want to make it really easy for the public to be engaged. And that means that we have to generate a wallet for somebody who's never used crypto before without them having to go through the more lengthy process of establishing, securing a metamass seed phrase and all that stuff. We want people to be able to click, click buy.
00:59:27.246 - 00:59:52.626, Speaker H: And we think that's really important for the ecosystem to grow. And at Royal, we really tested this past week with our Drop, with Nas, and of course, we had traffic of hundreds of thousands of unique users on the website ready to buy this thing. And unfortunately, it crashed our servers because we didn't anticipate that much demand. But what we learned is that there are a lot of Web Two based users that are excited about Web Three, but don't really know where to start. And that's kind of been our main mission.
00:59:52.818 - 01:00:27.358, Speaker E: I think there's two things there. First of all, I want to highlight that this desire for musicians to work with developers is happening at all scales. You're obviously an incredible artist and have had a strong following for many years. What I'm seeing that's really excited about the past couple of months is that independent artists who are doing their first foray into NFTs are deploying their own custom smart contracts. They're building out custom sites, and they're really experimenting with the technology in the same way that we had artist websites a couple of years back where you put your tour dates, you maybe put some merchandise. That is now evolving into this hub where it's more about community interaction, superfan relationships. People are selling NFTs directly through them, they're doing custom smart contracts.
01:00:27.358 - 01:01:12.686, Speaker E: And I think that that trend of being able to empower your community and really own your audience is very powerful. And the one thing I really want to highlight from what you just mentioned there is this future of music trend is becoming almost bigger than Web Three. I think it's to a state now where people are coming into crypto and buying their first music NFT prior to having ever used any form of technology in Web Three before. This is their first time downloading a wallet, it's their first time buying an NFT, it's their first time doing anything in Web Three. And I think that that as an entry point is really exciting because to me it signals that there is a brand new opportunity for the next generation of builders to target entirely new audience. It's not only the people who have been using Uniswap for months, it's not only the people who know how to make liquidity pools. We really need to pull back for a second and think about what are those first interactions that someone has with Web Three.
01:01:12.686 - 01:01:22.194, Speaker E: And to me I think that's a really powerful topic because you really get to challenge the preassumed notions that I think that people who use this technology every day, like me and you have just become very comfortable with.
01:01:22.392 - 01:01:59.150, Speaker H: Yeah, absolutely. And you kind of saw the same thing happen in the Web Two world, to be honest, where the first social media platform that at least in my age, everyone was using was MySpace. And that process of setting up your profile and communicating with message boards and all that stuff, it took a second to get used to because previously all there really was was email and aim, right? And now you have this new kind of public identity on the internet and that was kind of a process for people to onboard to. The same is happening today. I think. As you said, not everyone is captivated by visual NFTs. Of course I am and you are, and we love that stuff, but people are independently captivated by music.
01:01:59.150 - 01:02:12.754, Speaker H: And so having music as an entry point, which is a huge market in the Web Two world, makes a lot of sense to onboard the next million, or I should say 100 million users to the ecosystem. And at Royal we're just excited to help facilitate that.
01:02:12.952 - 01:02:47.258, Speaker E: Absolutely. And I want to quickly clarify for people who are not as familiar with music NFTs, I think the biggest shift from the NFTs we saw in the Nifty Gateway era is now people are collecting the audio file as you just highlighted. Whereas before there was an audio visual component, maybe there was like a little animated loop of a 15 2nd audio clip. People are collecting solely audio files with a song wave that has a full song associated with it, a full EP, a full album. And I think that transition from a snippet of a song that's more kind of highlighted on the visual side to actually collecting the sound file itself is kind of the major change that at least personally I'm seeing in the last couple of months of music NFT development.
01:02:47.434 - 01:03:39.818, Speaker H: Yeah, and I think that's like an important thing to double click on in the sense that from my background in IP and in the music business for ten years, unfortunately, collecting audio isn't really that scalable. It works for independent artists really well. If you own all of your rights on the publishing and composition side and the master recording side, you can pretty much do whatever you want and collecting audio makes sense. But unfortunately for most artists, they don't own all of their rights on either side of the recording, especially artists that have been signed to a record label or artists who have collaborated with another artist. So in most cases, when you tokenize an audio file, that is the equivalent in the kind of legacy music world to a license. And so this is kind of the philosophy behind Royal, and we can dive into this more deeply. When you go buy a song on itunes, and I'm not talking about paying for a Spotify subscription, when you pay that $0.99
01:03:39.818 - 01:04:15.210, Speaker H: on itunes, what you're buying is an unlimited, because unlimited amount of people can buy it, you're buying an unlimited license to listen to the song. You also get the actual MP3 file for download on your computer. It's actually MP4 in the case of itunes, what collectible NFTs are doing in the music world. It's kind of just buying a song on itunes, but with a cap. That's really all it is. I think at some point people are going to want something more. I think the form factor for music is going to evolve to be way more than just collectible audio files, which to me is kind of equivalent to collecting a CD or a vinyl.
01:04:15.210 - 01:05:00.730, Speaker H: And that's cool. The issue with it is there isn't much other value you get out of just the emotional value of owning that audio file. Part one, part two. It's impossible to scale that to most musicians, even like myself, where you have other writers that you need to make clearances for the music to be uploaded in the first place. Right? So in IP law, to get really specific here, the moment that a violation occurs is when somebody in an unauthorized way uploads the audio and monetizes it. So if you're an artist and you've worked with a bunch of other artists, you upload an MP3 file to IPFS and sell it as an NFT and you don't have the clearance from everyone else on that song, you're technically in violation of copyright law. And so I think that a lot of the collectible music projects are amazing for independent artists that own all of their music.
01:05:00.730 - 01:06:04.526, Speaker H: And in many ways those types of collectible NFTs might be the future for the independent music world, but when you think about all the other artists that aren't independent, they still need tools to engage in the web3 ecosystem as well. And that's kind of what Royal is building for, where when you buy any NFT on Royal, and we actually call them LDAs instead of NFTs, we call them limited digital assets so as to not scare people away from what's actually happening. When you buy one of those assets, you actually own rights in the song and you own art associated with it. The NFT does not point to the audio file. That means that any artist who's a participant on the song can sell whatever rights they maintain without having to get the approval of everyone else. And we think that's kind of crucial to scaling the ecosystem so that any artist can actually issue assets. And a lot of my friends call me all the time, oh, what do I do if I have this singer on this song who owns like 5%? Or what do I do if there was a drummer or a producer that owns 2%? Right? And technically those people can block the issuance of an NFT if they want to, and they might expect to get a high payment.
01:06:04.526 - 01:06:12.800, Speaker H: And so creating a form factor for all musicians to be able to mint NFTs we think is extremely, extremely important.
01:06:13.250 - 01:06:52.382, Speaker E: Yeah, and I hear that a lot myself too. I think that there's a lot of aversion to minting your first NFT as a musician because a lot of people think that when you mint an NFT, you are giving up 100% of the royalty rights associated with it. It feels like there's a learning curve where V one of this is just taking a leap of faith as you alluded to. I think buying an itunes MP3 is a great analogy. I like to use the analogy that you're buying a vinyl if there is only one of them or very few of them in the world. And so helping artists get over this hurdle of thinking that they're giving up their ownership to some random stranger on the Internet and instead just recognizing that right now in its current form, they're just giving up a really rare version of that song. I think it helps to get it started, but to really double down on what you said, I think that's a very early iteration of this.
01:06:52.382 - 01:07:18.760, Speaker E: Clearly the reason that you're building Royal and the reason why so many people are excited about music NFTs is I think there is a future in which that asset has full ownership of the song's rights. We're clearly a very far way away from getting there from both a legal and an infrastructure perspective. But that opportunity to go from collecting a really rare vinyl to that really rare vinyl having a direct claim on royalties and masters, I think that that's the biggest unlock that Royal is tackling today and why I'm so stoked and just really impressed by what you guys have been building.
01:07:19.370 - 01:07:49.006, Speaker H: Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I think using the rare vinyl analogy is true in that that is actually what you're buying. In many ways. When you buy art, it's similar. When you buy a painting, you technically don't have any rights in reproducing or commercializing that painting. And so it's not much different. The question really lies in how much do people really care? Or what is the premium value of owning a one of one digital vinyl versus actually having influence in the song success.
01:07:49.006 - 01:08:26.006, Speaker H: And I think that if we can get there, behaviors will change. Right. Where if you own a collectible of something, you'll obviously promote it to your friends, but realistically, that promotion is more of a flex than having any financial incentive or influence on your future. Right. It's more of like a, hey, I own this and I was there first, which is cool to stick your claim. But with music know, one of the things that we're excited about at Royal is when you own a piece of a song, you're now incentivized to promote it, you're now incentivized to share it with your friends, and that impact actually will affect your financial upside in the future. We think that's like another just level of depth that we're really excited about exploring.
01:08:26.006 - 01:09:05.090, Speaker H: And by the way, another thing with Royal that we're actually considering recently is when we do open the platform for anyone to use, to be able to use it, you can still set 0% ownership and issue just a collectible if you want to. We don't want to force anybody's hand in saying you have to give ownership to your fans. There might be a different like one song might have multiple tiers. At Royal, we have three tiers. We have gold, platinum and diamond. If the platinum and diamond tier represent ownership, but let's say it's a huge artist and maybe 0.1% of a song is just really not that much, and they want to just create a lower price point for fans to buy and buy a collectible version of the song that's still limited.
01:09:05.090 - 01:09:33.042, Speaker H: We think that's important too. Right? And so there's different price points for everything. Obviously, one of ones carry a big premium, as we know. But getting a larger fan base engaged and building an army around promoting your music of fans that are really close to that artist is super powerful. For us, the demand curve for music has pretty much been flat forever. It's pay for the license for the song for $0.99, pay for the subscription, in which case everyone has the same collection on their phone.
01:09:33.042 - 01:10:08.286, Speaker H: There's nothing unique about it. Everyone's paying that same subscription fee, pay for a live show ticket which shows patronage, pay for merch. Those are the only four ways that you can interact with music. But the actual emotional value of music is so much greater for humans, right? And so building these kinds of tools in the web3 world to capture that value is pretty much inevitable at this point. And my forecasting of the future is music NFTs today only represent zero point 11% of all NFT sales. I think that's going to grow pretty quickly to 10% to 20% in the next couple of years.
01:10:08.468 - 01:10:35.590, Speaker E: I couldn't agree more. And I really just want to commend you and your team for all of the work that you're doing behind the scenes. On the legal front, on the financial front, these are very tricky topics and ones that I think we're all looking for guidance on, so it doesn't go unnoticed. I think the fact that you guys are really just challenging this head on and making sure that you can give fans ownership in a way that's both legally compliant and exciting, it's really, really exciting to me. I think it's a huge leap forward for the space, and so I want to make sure that, you know, from someone who's very passionate about this space, you're doing a tremendous job, and it's extremely, extremely innovative.
01:10:36.250 - 01:11:20.318, Speaker H: We really appreciate that. I think when we started the company, the company was very much inspired by this idea that collectible music might not be enough in the long term. It's definitely an amazing starting point, don't get me wrong, and I really commend all the people who are building in that space. But for us, our biggest barrier was legal, as you said, compliance. I mean, we have to consider multiple realms of law, whether it's IP law, money transmission law, security law, securities law, and we're lucky to have been connected with the top compliance experts in all those categories. And then once you have that legal advice, you have to build product to meet all of these different requirements, and so it makes the process a little bit longer. You could spin up most Web Three projects in a matter of weeks if you're a good engineer.
01:11:20.318 - 01:11:40.010, Speaker H: For us at Royal, it took seven months to even launch a product based on all of our kind of compliance teams interacting with our product team. So, yeah, it is a challenge, and we definitely are facing it head on. But we're excited that our findings have been quite good and in favor of a more independent artist economy. And we think that we're going to get there.
01:11:40.160 - 01:11:56.830, Speaker E: I think people are going to be really excited about it. I mean, as you said, the demand this week from the first drop was insane, and I think that's a sign of what's to come. So I really want to really quickly get into some questions from the audience here before we wrap up. I really love this first one. What's the bigger opportunity, larger artists or independent artists? Also, how do you go beyond collectible use cases?
01:11:57.170 - 01:11:57.726, Speaker C: Great.
01:11:57.828 - 01:12:16.670, Speaker H: That's a great question. So I actually think that both are really important. Right? You kind of need bigger artists. If you're an artist that's starting your career, you're always inspired by what bigger artists are. Know, at least for me, I was inspired at the time when I started making music by Swedish House Mafia and Porter Robinson. Right. As an artist, they were big inspirations to me.
01:12:16.670 - 01:12:52.298, Speaker H: And so if you look as a smaller artist and you see what a big artist is doing, it encourages you to get your feet wet in a different world. In this case, web3. Right. So in many cases, those larger artists serve as huge signals that the world is finally embracing this technology. And if you look at just our investors and people who are endorsing Royal, we have everyone from Nas, who's like OG hip hop to Liam Payne, from One Direction to The Chainsmokers, to small independent artists like Verite, right? And Latasha. And you've seen this cross genre mentality that this is the future. And at Royal, we want to establish that.
01:12:52.298 - 01:13:43.854, Speaker H: We want to encourage people of all genres and all sizes to get involved. Those bigger artists are really key to getting those smaller artists involved. On the flip side, however, a small artist who's just starting Royal can be their opportunity to maintain their independence as an artist. And we think that's really powerful too, in that some of these bigger artists kind of have already been stuck in their existing systems. Whereas imagine if you're on Royal and you invest in the next Billie Eilish. I mean, that's incredibly powerful, right? And that artist explodes without the distribution of a traditional label, without the distribution of traditional marketing services, and just through their fans, we're probably going to see that happen in the next couple of years. An independent artist like Russ is my favorite example, completely independent artist who's able to leverage the Internet to build a fan base with Royal.
01:13:43.854 - 01:13:54.126, Speaker H: Now, we think artists will have tools to do that at a higher magnitude because their fans will be even more engaged and have financially aligned incentives. So, yeah, I think it applies to both large artists and small artists.
01:13:54.318 - 01:14:41.382, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's a symbiotic relationship. And I think what I'm seeing now is that large artists are helping us really get through the barriers to accessibility and adoption, really challenging the notion of what it means, like, to buy your first NFT. And independent artists are really in the trenches, building out grassroots products and services, using the technology very deeply. But I think the winning answer here is that both are going to play an extremely vital role in this success. What you're going to find is that a lot of the tools that independent artists are going to be picked up by larger artists, and a lot of the onboarding solution that larger artists are building for themselves are going to be adopted by independent artists. And so regardless of where you are in that stack, I think there's a really big opportunity for you to contribute in some way, shape or form and moving forward, I'm just excited to watch this whole landscape really pan out. Justin, I know that today we really dove deep onto Royal and the solution that you're working on, but there's a lot of other stuff out there, as I'm sure that you would recommend to other people as well.
01:14:41.382 - 01:14:53.560, Speaker E: And so for me personally, I just want to say thank you for your time today. I know it's been a crazy week, but you coming out and explaining what you're working on and helping everyone out this hackathon get a better understanding of Music NFTs in general. I think it's going to go a really far away.
01:14:53.930 - 01:14:56.680, Speaker H: Absolutely. We're excited to be a part of the process.
01:14:57.050 - 01:15:02.360, Speaker E: Love it. Karthik, I want to bring you back up here. I know we're right at time, I think we got into a lot, but I'm curious to hear what you thought.
01:15:02.810 - 01:15:35.080, Speaker A: I know we're right at time, so what I'll do is both of you on the spot and do one final question before we close. And my question is, there's over 800 developers, artists and designers participating over this weekend and over 100 of them are still looking for interesting ideas on what they can build or what they would like to be interested about. So what is something that you want to see, whether it's related to NFTs generally or music specifically on your wish list, whether you want to see as a product or a cool experiment, any kind of comments or ideas you want to share with the people here, we'll end off at that.
01:15:35.770 - 01:16:16.420, Speaker H: Yeah, I'll take a stab at that first. I think the biggest kind of cumbersome area for Music NFTs today is display layer. So it's really easy to buy a Visual NFT and make it your profile picture. Right. What is the solution for Music NFTs and how you share them with your friends? Like what type of display or player makes the most sense in kind of showing off your collection? It's something that we think is really important and no one's really cracked the code on yet. So if people are looking at similar to what Showtime has done for Visual NFTs and creating a social layer for that, I think creating a proper display or I should say listening layer for Music NFTs is really important in the future.
01:16:17.110 - 01:16:49.966, Speaker E: Absolutely love that. I'd follow on by saying distribution and aggregation are extremely important. We're seeing now that there's a variety of platforms to upload your Music NFTs, to being able to make it very easy to have those NFTs ported to multiple platforms and being able to aggregate where all of those NFTs exist is going to be very important. So I would double click on everything that Justin said. I think that curation is a phenomenal idea and I think there's going to be a lot of incentives around music curation. So for developers in the audience today, making it easier to discover music, making it easier to listen to that music, and then making sure you can pull it all into one place, I think those are some of the few ideas that I'd be really excited to see some ideas around.
01:16:50.068 - 01:17:08.158, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah. And also Justin, we just propose is a perfectly bite sized project to experiment with for a weekend hackathon. So this is great. Well, thank you so much for taking the time and talking to all these amazing developers about what they can do with NFTs. And we'll share with you what comes out of this weekend.
01:17:08.334 - 01:17:10.790, Speaker E: Thank you, Kartik. Look forward to seeing you soon, man.
01:17:10.860 - 01:17:11.970, Speaker H: Thanks, Cardi.
01:17:12.130 - 01:17:13.830, Speaker E: Thanks, Jetson. See ya.
01:17:15.130 - 01:18:05.880, Speaker A: All right, well, I know we couldn't get to all the questions that everybody had, but hopefully you got a taste of what's to come in this space, especially with the progress of what's happening with music NFTs and just overall things we can do in terms of blending creativity and web3. But we'll have a lot more talks today and some tomorrow that are all on the schedule. So with that, I'd like to close off this live stream and wrap things up so we can move all to Discord and make sure that we are ready to hack. So without further ado, I want to wish all of you happy hacking and we'll see all 800 plus of you on Discord. And for those of you who are not on Discord yet, it's Discord Gggcglobal. But see you all there and can't wait to see what comes out on Sunday for all of your projects. Take care, everybody.
