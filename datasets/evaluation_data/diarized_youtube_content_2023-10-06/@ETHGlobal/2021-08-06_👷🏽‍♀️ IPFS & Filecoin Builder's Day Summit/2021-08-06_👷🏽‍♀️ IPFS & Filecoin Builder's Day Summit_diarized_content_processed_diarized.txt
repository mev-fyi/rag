00:05:06.270 - 00:05:07.214, Speaker A: Good morning, good evening.
00:05:07.262 - 00:05:09.650, Speaker B: Good afternoon, everybody. My name is Kartik.
00:05:11.590 - 00:05:17.810, Speaker C: I'm Luke, and we will be your MCs. Today for the IPFS and Filecoin Builders Day summit.
00:05:18.550 - 00:06:16.346, Speaker B: So for those of you who don't know, this event in the summit is part of Hackfs, and all of you are watching this on Niefglobal TV. So for those of you who are going to be engaging with our speakers, if you have any questions for any of our speakers from our talks, be sure to sign in and ask those questions away, and we'll be able to relay those questions to our speakers. And Hack FS is a month long event where we have a hackathon going on, and we have a couple of summits for just what's happening on the hackathon side. We have over 650 developers from 61 different countries working on building amazing things in Web Three that use anywhere from storage, decentralized storage to smart contracts. And we can't wait to show you what everybody's building in the next couple of weeks. And also part of the hackathon, we're doing two summits to highlight what is happening in the IPFS and filecoin ecosystem. So today is our first summit of this month.
00:06:16.346 - 00:06:33.674, Speaker B: This is our Builders Day summit. And then next Friday, we'll be doing our storage provider summit. So let's just jump right into today's agenda. We're going to kick the day off by doing a keynote from Molly from Protocol Labs, and then we have all these amazing talks lined up. So just to give a quick overview.
00:06:33.722 - 00:06:35.230, Speaker A: We'Ll have Alan talk about Web Three.
00:06:35.300 - 00:07:02.826, Speaker B: Storage and NFT storage. Then we'll have Jimmy talk about estuary tech. Then we'll have Dan, who's going to be introducing the Palm Side chain. Then we'll have Ilya from near talk about how do you enable open web and consumer apps with NFTs. Then we'll have fast hack. We'll talk about how do you actually make really large and updatable and extensible NFTs using IPFS. Stefano then will be talking about the long hash Web Three accelerator program that they've been working on.
00:07:02.826 - 00:07:53.030, Speaker B: And then we'll let Michelle cover how you can get more involved and get more grants from the IP investment, ecosystem, foundations, and just the projects that you're building to get support. And then we'll close the day off by Blake talking about the Base Camp program that they've been working super hard on. So a lot of amazing talks for the next few hours. And without further ado, I want to just kick us off with our very first talk of the day. We have Molly, who's going to talk about just what's now possible with Valcoin. And just to kind of give a really brief intro, molly leads the PDP IPFS at Protocol Labs, and I'll stop cutting in our time for our talk and just let her kick it off with today. So welcome, Molly to the stage, and it's all yours.
00:07:54.490 - 00:07:54.950, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:07:55.020 - 00:08:18.130, Speaker E: Thank you so much for having me. This is super exciting. I cannot wait to see what everyone is going to build as part of Hackfest. And so super excited to get to chat with you today, and feel free to continue the conversation as we go forward. As well as you guys are building things, I have office hours. I'm going to be in Balkwind Slack, so feel free to ping me and ask me questions or show me cool demos of what you're doing. I'm excited.
00:08:18.130 - 00:08:59.934, Speaker E: Maybe I'll share my screen and hopefully everyone can see that everything's great. Perfect. Cool. So what I plan to chat with you about today is really quick overview of the stack, which I think you guys are all familiar with. Dive a little bit into where we were a year ago. It's crazy to think back into where we were in 2020, the year that is falling off of everyone's brains because it didn't exist, because of pandemics, but where we were a year ago, how far we've come, where we are now. What's possible to build now, some areas that are really exciting and some tools that are available to you to build on top of.
00:08:59.934 - 00:09:53.280, Speaker E: And then a quick sneak peek into some of the stuff that's coming next. So I work at Protocol Labs. Our mission is to drive breakthroughs in computing technology to push humanity forward. We have built a number nucleated, a number of new protocols and ecosystems trying to make the Internet more robust. One of those is Lapita P, the networking library of Web Three, which is used by IPFS, FalcoIn, polka dot, Ethereum Two, and many more. Folks, there's IPFS, which is the data and content platform of Web Three, which addresses content by what it is instead of where it's located, and now has this really phenomenal, amazing ecosystem that's grown around it an amazing community, and it's even now enabled on a number of major browsers, which is super cool. And then of course, FalcoIn, which I'm sure you've all heard about a lot today, which is the storage network of Web Three.
00:09:53.280 - 00:10:46.602, Speaker E: Its mission to build a decentralized storage network to store humanity's most important information. The network is made up of thousands of storage providers around the world, and it builds this marketplace between applications, like all of those amazing groups building on top of IPFS, who want storage in a decentralized network, and a globally distributed network of storage providers who offer that storage to them. And so to rewind a little bit, the network, you know, today still super new. And so where we were last year was a different place. A year ago, I spent most of my time staring at this super fun Snazzy Gantt chart. I don't know if anyone was familiar or part of the Filecoin ecosystem back then, but August 2020 was. We were in the midst of this Space Race calibration period.
00:10:46.602 - 00:11:22.566, Speaker E: We had not started space race, which was the filecoin incentivized. Testnet competition that ran for kind of a month before the Main Net started, hack FS had just completed and there were just a million things to land in order to actually make Filecoin as a network live. So here are some old snapshots I pulled out of old all hands decks that I had from back then. The testnet in August 2020 was like, barely limping along. Calibration Net had just gotten to ten pebbytes of data. We were like, psyched. It was like, oh my gosh, ten pebbytes.
00:11:22.566 - 00:12:18.042, Speaker E: That's super cool. Fast forward to today and we blow ten pebbytes out of the water. But that was cool at the time, and Space Race was in active preparation. We had this kind of Calibration Space Race Valcoin where we were looking at the deal storage and success rates for storage and retrieval across all of the folks who are participating in the Space Race competition. Super excited. After tons of time working with groups, like, we've gotten to 72% of storage providers were dilable, which is like, really exciting and crazy to think that far back into where the network was back then. A couple of other exciting things that were landing in the month of August, falcon had just implemented EIP 1559, so that we had the gas model, which I believe has just rolled out for Ethereum.
00:12:18.042 - 00:13:21.060, Speaker E: So we've been playing around with it for the past year and it's been awesome. It's been a big differentiator for us in terms of making sure that networks and messages and transactions flowed really smoothly within Palcoin. Message selection was a big part of that as well. Slate had just shipped building on top of Textile's Powergate, which was pretty much the builder's tool that was available to people at the time. I think at that point, Textile Powergate was maybe like a month old and available really just for hackfs developers. And so amazing to see how far the textile team has come since then in kind of the additional kind of solidity and tooling that they've built on top of this, which is amazing. And then, yeah, hackathus had just wrapped up and a ton of amazing projects coming out of Hackathus went on to other accelerators to launch into the ecosystem and kind of evolve and continue offering kind of new solutions to people in the web3 space, which is super cool.
00:13:21.060 - 00:14:42.762, Speaker E: Then fast forward two months into the future. October 15, the Filecoin Network went live with Main Net Liftoff, which was a really big milestone for a lot of groups, and super excited to kind of start that new phase of the Filecoin journey. And now kind of looking where we are about ten months later, the network has already amassed eight exabytes of storage over eight exabytes, which is just crazy to think about. I think this blows my expectations for where we would have been by end of year 2021, completely out of the water, and that was even blowing the remember, Ten Petabytes was really exciting back during early days of the network. So to reach this point is really cool to have masked all of this storage capacity that's available for Web Three developers, anyone in the wider internet ecosystem who wants to have kind of decentralized storage for their tools and protocols. There's also now a huge and growing ecosystem, a ton of open source contributors and a good storage provider community as well. And so to kind of look at that, you can see here that the amount of available data in the network has been growing a ton.
00:14:42.762 - 00:15:32.586, Speaker E: And this has actually already doubled. The storage onboarding rate has doubled just in the past month since the hyperdrive network upgrade that went out in end of June. And so we're seeing this growth rate continue to ramp up. I think it's likely that we're going to hit 15 exabytes or more by end of year. So it's just a really crazy kind of war chest of data capacity to bring to bear on all of these applications. And as part of that's, creating a lot of demand amongst the storage provider community for amazing data to store. So lots of groups are really reaching out to folks who can act as really valuable clients, who can bring kind of public data sets into the FalcoIn network and demonstrate how amazing this solution is for them.
00:15:32.586 - 00:16:12.570, Speaker E: And so definitely, if you are someone who is tooling in those open data set communities, there's a lot of opportunity here. As you can see, storage deals as well. Utilization of that capacity has been growing super fast since January of this year. It's just like, whatever, four x, five x. It's going really growing a lot, which is super exciting. But also we have so much more to do here and an area that a ton of folks in this space are investing in super hard. The ecosystem has grown massively in just less than a year that the Falcon network's been live.
00:16:12.570 - 00:16:58.338, Speaker E: A ton of amazing partners have joined this awesome ecosystem to help build the network here. And there's now a ton of applications, tools, developer, SDKs that are available for you as builders to build on top of and harness as part of your IPFS and filecoin Web Three builders journey. And so that's actually the thing that I want to spend most of my time today chatting about, which is what's now possible, what can you be building? And I know a ton of folks who are participating here in Hackavas actually already had a long chat with Juan about all of the exciting things that could be built here. I know there was a big brainstorm session earlier this week. If you missed it, go check out the video. It's on the ETH Global YouTube page. I watched it.
00:16:58.338 - 00:18:15.306, Speaker E: I thought it was amazing. I'm super excited about all the stuff you guys are going to be building, but I just wanted to highlight maybe three areas which I'm really excited about. And I think there's new tools that have just become available for you to build on top of and want to make sure that you're all aware of them so that you can blaze forward in your developer journey and can kind of build on top of the shoulders of everyone who has come before and focus on really reaching users in the web3 space or building the thing that really sings for you. You don't have to go and kind of reinvent some of the underlying building blocks. And so those three areas are, one, Web Three native DApps on Filecoin building on top of all of the amazing DevTools from Powergate to Web Three Storage, which just launched last week. Building things around NFTs, NFT Marketplaces, Minters Galleries on top of Filecoin, using NFT storage, which has been around for a couple of months now and is being used by folks like OpenSea and others. And then building applications around photo, video, large data archives, pulling on some of the amazing kind of pioneering work that Starlink and Internet Archive have been doing around using FalcoIn as a verifiable storage layer.
00:18:15.306 - 00:18:54.330, Speaker E: So, those are my three areas I want to chat with you about. So, first, web Three apps, notably things like Satellite or Audience, are doing an awesome job here in this space. This is a super exciting area, and there's a ton of tools that groups who are excited about building new Web Three DApps can use. I mentioned Slate already. They have like a whole developer aspect as well. They've created both an application and a ton of building blocks that developers can utilize to kind of leapfrog forward. And so definitely go check out Slate and see if they're a great place to build on top of.
00:18:54.330 - 00:19:42.426, Speaker E: I know that folks have probably already seen the talk that Carson gave earlier this week about the work that Textile was doing to bridge Falconcoin into various other ecosystems. And so they already have the near bridge set up. I believe they're bringing it to Ethereum, and I think it's Polygon in kind of the next short time period. And so this is a really cool kind of leapfrog forward if you're building things kind of in the smart contract space and you want to take advantage of decentralized off chain storage because on chain storage doesn't scale nicely, then definitely, definitely go check out what the Textile team has been building. Their implementation of kind of auctions for this data is pioneering and awesome, and we're all cheerleading and learning from it and figuring out how we can bring.
00:19:42.448 - 00:19:43.306, Speaker D: It to more things.
00:19:43.408 - 00:20:32.294, Speaker E: And so they're an awesome toolkit. They also, of course, have Powergate 2.0, which is the iteration from the 1.0 that launched just over a year ago. And so they have a ton of tools here, especially if you're building kind of like a dynamic application on top of Filecoin. Fleek is also an awesome team to look at they have a files app demonstrating use of the Space Demon which packages together IPFS textile and aims to make a really easy developer SDK. If you are doing something that has maybe a static front end component to a smart contract backend, fleek is also going to be your best friend when it comes to deploying, say like a DeFi front end really smoothly from GitHub.
00:20:32.294 - 00:21:23.450, Speaker E: They are kind of your Netlify easy replacement. I can deploy a website on Fleek within like three button clicks or something at this point, which is just kudos to that team for doing an amazing, amazing job on the developer experience side. Highly recommend go checking it out. You should probably also check out Ceramic, especially if you're doing dynamic document updates. I think they just recently launched their main net. It's super, super cool and if you're doing anything around private encrypted data, definitely look at the kind of pioneering work they've been doing around Dag Jose, dag Jose and they've been really pushing things forward. There also bring in a lot of the decentralized identity part that many application builders want to utilize and so go check that mean so many, so many of these that I could just go on and on.
00:21:23.450 - 00:22:36.114, Speaker E: Definitely check out Truffle if you're doing anything and you want to be kind of testing within their amazing developer tools like Ganache and of course MetaMask. I feel like their fill snap is almost going from developer beta to actual open access usage. But if you're aiming for the lightweight ease of use of a MetaMask integration, there's a filecoin Snap for you. And of course I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Web Three storage, which you're going to actually get a whole talk about right after this from Alan. But awesome easy new storage layer for all of your favorite Web Three assets to store them really easily. It's an aggregator and a broker in FalcoIn network terms, which means that it helps take many small files or like app data objects and aggregate them into FalcoIn deals. And it does deal management, deal brokering on behalf of all of these clients and then it gives you back all of the information that you need about what deal all your data is stored in and how long it's going to be persisted with network and all of that sort of stuff.
00:22:36.114 - 00:23:10.986, Speaker E: And it's super easy. I think the record is I'm sorry if I'm stealing Alan's Thunder 56 seconds from sign up to having submitted their first stored their first file on filecoin. So that looks amazing. Talk about developer kind of throughput in terms of being able to have just like a drop in place solution to then move on to all of the exciting hard stuff when it comes to building applications on Web Three. So I'll not steal any more balance thunder, but definitely go check this out. Okay, next space NFTs. NFTs are like my favorite thing, especially when they're cats.
00:23:10.986 - 00:23:47.174, Speaker E: But there's so much cool stuff happening here. I'm sure there's a massive community here in the hackath, hackathon who are building cool new things in the NFT space, or cool new things in the NFT gallery museum space. Super cool. The Metaverse is meeting web3, and I'm so excited about it. But NFT storage should be your best friend. It's really easy to use. You can store NFTs up to 32GB per NFT, which I haven't met anyone yet who needs to blow past that limit, but maybe it'll happen, in which case split it into multiple use Web Three storage.
00:23:47.174 - 00:24:14.030, Speaker E: Perfect. But definitely come check out NFT storage. It's a super useful tool. It helps you be protected from things like rug pulls, lost NFTs insecure links, size limits from other tools, all of that sort of stuff. And I think we just crossed actually, sorry, my slides out of date. We've just crossed 2 million NFTs stored on NFT storage. Many of them are coming from Ethereum, but they're also coming from places like Polygon and other places.
00:24:14.030 - 00:24:58.050, Speaker E: And definitely go give it a try. It is almost as easy as Web Three storage. Maybe it's easier, I'm not sure, but it's amazing. So go give it a try. This has been used by folks like OpenSea to do their freezing metadata feature that they launched a month and a half ago or so. And there's a lot of great content here about how you can use IPFS and FalcoIn to kind of support the really critical parts of addressing and persistence for NFTs, so we can make sure that this collective cultural work that we are building in this NFT collection across all of these amazing creators, we'll be here 2510 years from now. And all of those NFTs kind of stick around and stay super accessible.
00:24:58.050 - 00:26:11.730, Speaker E: And just a reminder to folks that rug pulls are a real thing. And definitely use IPFS use Filecoin to make sure that your data stays around long term. My last and third area is around photo, video and data archives and the amazing applications you can build around this. Actually, Audius is another great example of this, where it's all of this amazing audio content that's being kind of minted in a way on the Ethereum blockchain and stored on IPFS and I believe Filecoin at this point. Another great example of someone who's building around this is the Internet Archive. They're bringing a number of their kind of archives of amazing talk about humanity's most important content, most important data that we've amassed, bringing this to FalcoIn as part of the FalcoIn archives project. And a thing that's really exciting here, I feel like there's actually a lot of opportunity for builders, there's fewer developer tools here, so that means there's an opportunity for building tools both for developers and for these large storage clients to make sure that all of this data can move smoothly around in the Web Three ecosystem.
00:26:11.730 - 00:26:58.930, Speaker E: Because we're talking big data here, we're talking pebabyte data sets. And so it gets exciting. But that's also a huge opportunity. Really kudos to Jim for building this visualization, but there's a huge opportunity to apply the marketplace example from NFTs to large data sets as well. As I mentioned, there's eight exabytes of capacity. There's a ton of storage providers who are really looking for how they can bring their storage capacity to bear on humanity's most important content. And doing the matchmaking between large clients who have pebbabyte datasets and large storage providers who really want to put their capacity to use is a new opportunity, just like the marketplace between a NFT creator and an NFT collector.
00:26:58.930 - 00:27:56.666, Speaker E: And so I would be excited to chat with any group who's looking at this intersection and wants to build kind of an auction house for data sets or tools for enabling the kind of interaction between these two groups. I think this is a really exciting space. I know a number of large storage clients who are like, wow, the Ten X Multiplier for storing large data. I would pay a hefty penny for that. And so if you are excited about this, there may be a lot of opportunities for you as kind of a broker or clients, to build an idea for people who are building. On top of such data sets is the work that the Starling Foundation, or Starling, has been doing with the USC Showa Foundation, for example, with their Photographic Archive of Trust, which documents the 2020 primary election. I believe it's beautiful.
00:27:56.666 - 00:29:22.420, Speaker E: It's like this great overview of kind of how they used kind of on device capture of metadata, chunking this data, storing it to filecoin and then visualizing it from a user perspective so that anyone who's browsing kind of content in? I believe it was Reuters in. Kind of like the Reuters UI can see where images were taken and verify that kind of the custody supply chain of that data so that they can increase their trust in media. I think this is a really cool example and it really builds on top of this kind of checkpointed use of a distributed storage network and the verification of the proofs of storage. Really using FalcoIn there to show yes. This is the exact content content addressed that's been stored here over time and can be persisted long term in a way that everyone can verify. And so I think this concept of verifiable storage is a really interesting idea that a lot of kind of large archives or kind of large data set communities may find really exciting so that you can kind of look at these continuous audits that data has been publicly stored, verified, and stays available. And I think there's a lot of opportunity around that.
00:29:22.420 - 00:30:25.314, Speaker E: I'm almost out of time, so I'll just give you a quick preview into a couple of things that are really exciting that are coming next. I already mentioned NFT storage and Web Three storage, but it's still new that you can store up to 32GB per NFT. So go and take advantage of that. Would love to see some video NFTs or Metaverse NFTs or other really cool things that are being kind of built and stored here and definitely make use of Web Three storage, which is brand new off the presses. Another new area that's coming up is this kind of cheap, fast verifiable storage through things like the bridge work that Textile has been doing and also some of the work that's kind of in the works around content indexing. So you might have heard about Car V Two if you pay really close attention to the Filecoin ecosystem. But there's a lot of work happening to make sure that all storage deals that get stored on Filecoin are also indexable and accessible through IPFS gateways.
00:30:25.314 - 00:31:00.178, Speaker E: And so a lot of work is happening there. Get excited about it. Should have some more information in the next couple of months. Third, there's a new FIP that you should check out. I know people here probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about FIPS. I spend a lot of my time thinking about Falcon improvement proposals and it's super exciting. It can make storing data and deal making like hundreds of X faster, cheaper, easier, and it really unlocks all of this storage capacity that storage providers have amassed so far so that you can make deals for hundreds of petabyte archives really quickly.
00:31:00.178 - 00:32:07.674, Speaker E: And that's super exciting and it just brings the accessibility of this technology. So if you're going to be building something for the next month, think about how you can kind of parallel that work with some of the new FIPS that are landing here as well and how you can take advantage of them. And finally, this is an area super, super excited about, is really opening up Filecoin actors in many ways to more developers as well, bringing things like EDM smart contracts into Filecoin. This is still in super early days from a design perspective. Go check out the fifth issue if you want to kind of contribute your $0.02 or if you have a lot of expertise with the ins and outs of Solidity and have a lesson or two to share. But really excited to make all of the storage in Filecoin programmable and accessible through kind of a smart contract layer there as well, so that we can script things like the concept of repair miners that just automatically on the filecoin blockchain, make additional storage deals to globally end up with many redundant copies of your data and much more.
00:32:07.674 - 00:32:43.480, Speaker E: So much is going to be interesting here from a defill perspective as well, which is like a DeFi but with Filecoin. Anyways, there's a lot of really cool stuff and I'm so excited to see what you all build because there's an amazing community here and I know that folks are going to just blow everyone away. So with no further ado, get building, and I'll hand it off to Alan to talk to you more about Web three storage and how you can build on top of that. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or on Falcon Slack, MoMac two eight on Twitter, MoMac Two on Falcon Slack, and happy to chat more.
00:32:50.690 - 00:33:19.782, Speaker C: Well, thank you for that. That was an incredible presentation. It's been an incredible year for the whole filecoin ecosystem. Obviously, I think we're running a little bit low on time for questions, but I do encourage people to continue the conversation in the discord. As was stated, our next presentation comes from Alan. He needs no introduction, but I'll give him one anyway. He's a software engineer working with Protocol Labs, currently working to make the distributed web more accessible to developers.
00:33:19.782 - 00:33:24.860, Speaker C: Alan, if you want to get started, I will hand it over to you.
00:33:28.430 - 00:33:41.520, Speaker A: Sure thing. Thank you. Okay, let me just share this with you all. All right?
00:33:42.690 - 00:33:43.102, Speaker C: Okay.
00:33:43.156 - 00:34:07.542, Speaker A: If you don't see the screen, then let me know. It's going to be boring. All right. Welcome to this presentation. I'm Alan, and this is a mashup of two talks about storing data on IPFS and filecoin using webfree storage and NFT storage. So let's do it. First of all, I'm going to talk about NFTs quite a lot.
00:34:07.542 - 00:34:47.000, Speaker A: The kind of off chain side of them, how they can be stored decentralized on IPFS and filecoin for the long haul. So I'm kind of new to NFTs. Most people are. They haven't been around for that long. But when I found out about them, I was super excited to see that the IPFS was already being used to store them. So, for example, if I go to any kind of website like this one, for instance, this is a game, it uses NFTs. They have, like, a kind of marketplace, and they have NFTs that you can buy and trade and stuff.
00:34:47.000 - 00:35:14.880, Speaker A: So let's have a look at I don't know this one. For instance, I happen to know that this particular game uses the marketplace of marketplaces called OpenSea. OpenSea. There we go. And I can just paste in, hopefully, the token ID of this particular NFT. Hopefully I can click on it. Did that come up? There we go.
00:35:14.880 - 00:35:33.730, Speaker A: Is it working? Hello. There we are. There it is. Come on, Internet.
00:35:40.410 - 00:35:41.160, Speaker E: No.
00:35:43.450 - 00:36:13.166, Speaker A: OpenSea is not having a good time at the moment. All right, let's try one more time. Okay. Right. Anyway, this is a cool car, but I can click through, and I can see that its metadata is here. I should just be able to click on this. This talk is, like, fraught with danger, so we shall see how it goes.
00:36:13.166 - 00:36:32.886, Speaker A: It doesn't look like things are going to work out so well today. For me, anyway. This is going to IPFS IO. You can see in the bottom left there that it's a CID on. IPFS IO. And the metadata for this particular NFT, here it is, it's just come up, is stored on IPFS. So hooray for that.
00:36:32.886 - 00:37:23.590, Speaker A: That's great. And hang on, here we go, back to the notes. There we go. But why is data for NFTs stored on IPFS anyway? Well, it's because it's kind of prohibitively expensive to store data on chain, on the ethereum blockchain at least. And IPFS actually has some really nice properties for off chain data that we'll go into in a little bit. And so as I learned a little bit more about NFTs, I came to realize that the developers that are enabling NFT creators, so like OpenSea, for example, like foundation, like Zora, they all really cared about users being able to access their data should they ever just disappear off the face of this Earth. If they fade away like that, they still want people to access these NFTs that they've bought and created and traded, so they don't want the NFTs to just disappear also.
00:37:23.590 - 00:38:09.554, Speaker A: And so IPFS, this comes into play now, and this thing called IPFS can solve this problem. It actually fits the bill really well. And from my point of view at least, it's not really surprising that it's being used. So let me just rewind a little bit and explain some basics of IPFS in hopefully not too much technical detail, but I've chosen a little NFT here. He's a little one eyed squid thing that's actually on that sandbox game anyway. So if I put him on IPFS, firstly, what do you get? You get a CID? It's called a content Identifier. And CIDs are a kind of cryptographic hash and they address the content, not its location.
00:38:09.554 - 00:38:59.014, Speaker A: They address that squid with the one eye, not where it is. And that means that any given CID will always refer to the same piece of content. So if that squid were to grow another eye, for instance, then the CID for that squid would actually change. And what typically happens is those CIDs are stored on chain and they're linked to from chain. And if that wasn't the case, if we used a regular URL to Google Drive or like dropbox URL or whatever, that could be problematic. Why could that be problematic? Well, the content at the end of that URL could be deleted by the owner, the domain could expire or the hosting, it could not be paid and then just go away. The image could or video or whatever it is could be altered in some way.
00:38:59.014 - 00:39:55.154, Speaker A: So I could have my Squid turned into a cute cat or something, which would be disappointing. Or for instance, the URL just might not be accessible from within your country, or maybe you're in some sort of corporate firewall or something where you actually need to get hold of that data from a peer that's maybe closer to you than the Internet location where it actually is. So IPFS, how does it work anyway? So if someone who's using IPFS requests that data by its CID, then the person who has it will send it back to you. And they'll receive it. You'll receive it. And now two nodes have that same content and they can serve it to anyone else who comes along. So like this if someone else comes along goes, do you have this CID? The content for this CID and Weaver, one of those nodes can help to transfer the bytes to that node.
00:39:55.154 - 00:40:27.966, Speaker A: We call it bit swapping, because why not? That happens. And now three of them have it. And the cool thing about this is that the original node who had the content can actually go away, like gone, and the data will still be retrievable from other nodes in the network. And this is the awesome power of peer to peer hooray caveats. There's two caveats. The first one is that if all of the nodes that have the content go away, then you're not going to be able to retrieve it's. Kind of obvious, worth stating.
00:40:27.966 - 00:40:55.286, Speaker A: If there's no one on the internet who has the content, you're not going to be able to get the content. That's caveat number one. Caveat number two is slightly less obvious. It is garbage collection. So depending on your configured kind of GC configuration, it might run at a particular time. It might run when your configured repo storage limit is hit. So you might be fetching things from IPFS.
00:40:55.286 - 00:41:45.654, Speaker A: It all goes into your repo and eventually you'll use enough data that IPFS will go, okay, we're kind of full now, let's do a GCE run. And the third other time that it might be run is it could be run manually. So you can actually invoke GCE from the command line, or if you've got the Http API exposed, you can call it like that. So what you need to do is tell IPFS that this content is not garbage. Because when you obtain content from the network that you didn't actually add yourself, that content is eligible for garbage collection. So if I got this picture of the squid from someone else, then it could be garbage collective in the future. So what you need to do is kind of tell your IPFS that this piece of content is a rare NFT and it's not trash.
00:41:45.654 - 00:42:20.498, Speaker A: Don't throw it in the bin, please. And in IPFS, that's referred to as pinning. And if you don't pin your data, then it will eventually be garbage collected. So even if the content is super popular, you can still eventually exit the network. And so these two caveats are why developers generally use a third party service like Pinata or Textile Fleek to store their content. Because they have nodes that are publicly available and they stay online like twenty four, seven, and obviously they pin the content so it doesn't disappear. Cool.
00:42:20.498 - 00:42:46.878, Speaker A: So NFT storage. Molly just mentioned this earlier, so you kind of already know a little bit about it. It's something that we've been working on for a while now. It's a place where you can store your NFT data decentralized on IPFS and filecoin safe in the knowledge that it'll be there tomorrow. And it hopefully goes some way to addressing that permanence problem. And it's free. It's free as long as we can possibly make it free.
00:42:46.878 - 00:43:01.694, Speaker A: And one of the founding kind of principles is that it should be easy to store data using this service. So how does it work? Well, you upload your NFT data to NFT Storage, and NFT Storage stores that data on IPFS nodes in the network.
00:43:01.742 - 00:43:02.386, Speaker F: That's right.
00:43:02.488 - 00:44:03.734, Speaker A: We actually have a cluster and we store it on free nodes at so okay, so far so good. But how's that different from any other pinning service? Well, behind the scenes, what NFT Storage is doing is it's negotiating deals to store your data with storage providers on the filecoin network. And so the filecoin network, you might already know, incentivizes the storage providers to store data quite heavily. They get paid to store data. They also typically get paid when data is retrieved, and they also get block rewards for providing capacity to the network. So why is that good? Well, if NFT Storage were just to happen to just go away, like poof, it's gone. And also every IPFS node on the network went away as well, then the filecoin storage providers who have the content will still have it, and they will store it for the duration of the deal that's been made for them.
00:44:03.734 - 00:44:33.760, Speaker A: And so you can think of these storage providers as just another set of IPFS peers with really strong incentives to continue storing that data. And this is hopefully a really good level of redundancy, basically, and should, like I said, go some way to solving that permanence problem. So here it is again. NFT Storage free, decentralized storage for NFTs on IPFS and filecoin. And the URL is NFT storage. I've said it about a thousand times. You should go take a look.
00:44:33.760 - 00:44:56.758, Speaker A: We have a simple API. It's expressed as an open API schema. If you don't know what that means, it means we can generate docs like this. We can also actually generate clients from this schema, which is kind of rad in different languages. That's really cool. The API is real small. You're probably going to need even smaller subset of it like these two.
00:44:56.758 - 00:45:33.554, Speaker A: Like, if you want to upload a file, just post upload. But what I really wanted to draw your attention to here is this check API. And so with this API, you can actually check the status of the CID of any NFT that's been uploaded to NFT Storage. And the output for that kind of looks like this. And so you can see here the pinning status of this particular CID. But also the deals with filecoin storage providers that have been made, or are being made currently. And so you can see their status, like time date stamps for when things have happened.
00:45:33.554 - 00:46:16.910, Speaker A: The on chain deal IDs. So you can go and look it up. You can see the address of the storage provider who's actually storing it or going to be storing it. And what's really interesting here is that there's two things. There's the batch route CID here and also the data model selector. And they're the kind of important ones because what happens is that as data comes into NFC storage, it gets kind of aggregated together into this big pile of data and that gets sent to miners. And then if you ever want to get your piece of data out of that big aggregate, then you're going to need the data model selector and it allows you to pinpoint your particular bit within the aggregate.
00:46:16.910 - 00:46:37.986, Speaker A: So anyway, this is a cool API that you can use to check stuff. We also have the same thing in web3 storage, which I'm going to talk about in a SEC. JS client. We have an official JavaScript client. This one isn't generated from open API. We've lovingly handcrafted this one for you. It's got TypeScript types.
00:46:37.986 - 00:47:08.740, Speaker A: It's got nice API, Docs. We've got a metadata API as well. And this metadata API is designed to make Minting NFTs really easy for you by guiding you through creating like ERC, seven, two, one and 1155 compatible metadata. And we will take a look at that. Let's take a look at that now. All right, here's an actual demo. So let's see how it goes.
00:47:08.740 - 00:47:32.970, Speaker A: Demo gods are hopefully going to help me out here. Here we go. Here's the whole desktop. Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this metadata API. I've already installed the client from NFT storage using NPM. I'm importing it like this. And I've just created a version here.
00:47:32.970 - 00:48:25.126, Speaker A: I've created my token already on the website. Just go to NFT storage and create it. I've exported it in my terminal so that should just work. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to try and store this image called Pinpy because it's appropriate about pinning and stuff. So Pinpy, let's try and store this using the metadata API. So what I need to do is call client store and then we give it an object that looks really similar to something that you'd get when you click through from your token Uri, which is minted on chain. What is stored on ITFs essentially the metadata for the NFT where the actual image file or video or whatever it is can be stored, et cetera, et cetera.
00:48:25.126 - 00:49:15.030, Speaker A: But it's really simple. It looks something like this. I'm going to call it Pinpy. It has a description and we're going to call it Pinpy Comic because it's a comic thing. And then what's kind of cool here is that the property is called Image. And this has to be essentially the URL to an image where your NFT, which is your NFT essentially, but what we put in here is actually just a file. And what happens behind the scenes is that the NFT Storage client will automatically upload that image for you and replace that image with a URL to the IPFS asset which is stored on IPFS.
00:49:15.030 - 00:49:39.650, Speaker A: So let's just quickly do that. Create a file. I'm going to use FS read file sync. I'm going to get the Pin by JPEG. Here we go. Get to give it a file name which could be different from the actual file we're reading from. And I'm just going to give it a Mime type of image.
00:49:39.650 - 00:50:24.234, Speaker A: Jabug, cool. So this returns a promise. So I need to await on it and I get back this object. I get this metadata object and I'm just going to log out the metadata URL. And this is the URL that you'd actually use in your Minting process that would be stored on chain, essentially console log, metadata. I'm just going to print out the data here just to show that this file gets transformed into a URL to this particular asset. I think that's all I need to do.
00:50:24.234 - 00:50:58.742, Speaker A: So we'll see if this works. Wait, store mid. I'm in the wrong directory. Okay, sorry about that. Right, here we go. So let's just take a look here. This logged out the URL.
00:50:58.742 - 00:51:33.314, Speaker A: This is the URL that we're going to put in on chain. And also here is the data and you can see this image got transformed into a URL as well. So that's super cool. Here we go. And what I should just be able to do is head on back over to here and if I put this into my browser yes, there we go. And I should just be able to fetch it from any IPFS http gateway. And this is the data that I uploaded to IPFS.
00:51:33.314 - 00:51:55.546, Speaker A: So super cool. All right, that demo successfully done. Stop that sharing. Okay. Right, let's get back to slides because slides, slides are here. Here we go. Cool.
00:51:55.546 - 00:52:23.474, Speaker A: All right, so what do we do there? Well, we actually uploaded data and then we got back a CID from NFT Storage. And NFT Storage is doing the work of generating that CID from the data that we sent it. And there's a couple of problems with that. Firstly, we have to trust NFT Storage is doing the right thing. It's not giving us the CID of some malicious virus in some way. It wouldn't do that. But you don't know in this trustless peer to peer world we're trying to inhabit.
00:52:23.474 - 00:53:22.380, Speaker A: So it's better to have generated that CID ourselves. Why can't we do that? Why don't we do that? Well, the other thing before we get onto that, the other thing is that we have to wait for that CID to come back to us. We have to upload that data and wait for that CIDD to come back when actually it would be really useful to have that CID before we uploaded because then we could mint our NFT on chain whilst it's uploading. And if it's something big, then it might take a while to upload. So actually having that CID generated on the client side before it gets uploaded is really useful because then I can use it somewhere else. I could maybe even store it in a database in my app or so it means that I don't have to trust NFT storage and I also get to solve this UX issue, basically. So, yeah, why can't I just generate that CID before uploading the data? Well, turns out you can.
00:53:22.380 - 00:53:49.730, Speaker A: New is storing cars. And cars are not automobiles in this world. Cars are content addressable archives. And it's kind of like Tar for Dags. And Dags are directed as cyclic graphs and they are the things that IPFS generates when you import data to it. So, yeah, Tar for dags, if that's a thing anyway. So it allows you to know that CID before you upload and in the client.
00:53:49.730 - 00:54:15.034, Speaker A: So on the client side, we can do the work to generate that CID. And it means assembling that data into the graph. But then we have that CID, we have that root file, but once we have the graph, we pack it into a car and send the car instead. Don't send the data, send the car. It's got the dag. And that can just be stored by NFT storage. You know, what's being stored is the thing that you added because you generated the CID on the client side.
00:54:15.034 - 00:54:46.254, Speaker A: So there we go. And it also means that we can split it up into multiple cards. You can send partial Dags like bits of it. And that's cool because if you've got loads of data, you can split it up into smaller bits. And it also allows us to send data that's more than 100 megabytes in size. One of the kind of quirks of this service is that we decided to put it on like cloudflare workers. And they are cool because they put your worker close to whoever's requesting that API or using that API.
00:54:46.254 - 00:55:27.234, Speaker A: But they do have a limit on how much data you can send them in one chunk. But it's okay because we can chunk up things so we don't have to abide by this 100 megabyte rule anymore. So you typically end up this is completely contrived diagram, but you might end up with something like this. A yellow line kind of rings around the nodes in the graph that you'd maybe be sending in one car. So you might send this set of nodes in one car, you might send this set in another car, and you might send this set in the third car. And we know that all of these cars are related because they have the same root CID. That's pretty cool.
00:55:27.234 - 00:55:53.178, Speaker A: And that allows like, failure and retry without sending everything. Again, we can just send any car in any order because it doesn't matter. And that allows us to also report on progress after we finish sending a chunk. So we can say we've done enough and you get that UI feedback. So that's cool. All right, let's try a real quick storing the card demo. I know, I feel like this is going way over time.
00:55:53.178 - 00:56:10.574, Speaker A: I'm sorry. All right, so here we go. Stop the share. Let's share my whole screen. Okay, cool. Great. So this is very similar to what we had before.
00:56:10.574 - 00:56:31.590, Speaker A: I've imported this extra IPFS car module. This is going to help us pack a car from our content. The path I'm going to use is I'm going to use Pinpy again. Pinpy JP. The content is actually so that's just the file name, essentially. Read file. Read the file.
00:56:31.590 - 00:56:53.680, Speaker A: Actually, I'm not going to use Pinpy at all because what I want to demonstrate is actual splitting and chunking. I've got my skate movie here. It's 24 megabytes. Let's just make sure that here we go. Here's my skating movie. It's 24 megabytes. That's great.
00:56:53.680 - 00:57:33.042, Speaker A: I'm going to use that. What happens is that the cars get split into ten meg chunks. So we should see free chunks, 210 meg size and one four megapi. Here it is. Typing. Here we go. The cool thing is, at this point here, we've packed this video into a car file and we've also got the CID before we've even sent it to our client.
00:57:33.042 - 00:58:13.894, Speaker A: So we got the CID here and when we get the CID returned from the client, we can verify that the CID we created is a CID that has been returned to us. So I'm calling this method called store car pass. It the car. And the cool thing is that we've got this nice callback, which gives us the size of the chunk that was the car chunk that was stored. So we can log out ah, we can log out the how many bytes we stored for each chunk that gets sent. Hopefully that's good to go. Store car.
00:58:13.894 - 00:58:29.420, Speaker A: There we are. MPM node node node index. Let's try again. Here we go. So you can see here, we got that CID like straight away. And so now what's happening is there we go. We've got one chunk got sent.
00:58:29.420 - 00:58:54.530, Speaker A: That's like four meg. And so these other two here's, a ten meg chunk just come through another ten meg. So we got free chunks. They all got sent in parallel. We send up to free in parallel to not starve browser browsers. But that's the kind of cool thing about it. And the four megabyte chunk, even though it was maybe at the end of the data, it won because it's smaller.
00:58:54.530 - 00:59:23.630, Speaker A: So there you go. And the CID we got back is the same as the CID that we captulated. That's pretty cool. Back to the slides. All right, we are getting on for finishing off, but at this point. I've talked a whole lot about NFT storage, but web free storage is the brand new thing. It's just launched almost literally.
00:59:23.630 - 01:00:04.170, Speaker A: And web free storage is built for any data. So it's not just NFTs? If you remember this slide from earlier, then webfree storage does exactly the same thing. But it's not just for NFTs, it's for any data. So you can put images, videos, you can put documents, whatever you like, even IPLD data as well. So you can pick what works for you the best. So if you're going to be minting NFTs, then you're probably going to want to go with NFT storage. It gives you the tools, as you saw, to create and store NFT metadata.
01:00:04.170 - 01:00:30.500, Speaker A: And that metadata will comply to Ethereum standards. It also follows best practices for linking to data stored on IPFS and for everything else. Then Webfree storage has you covered. So you should check that out. The other difference right now is that cars are baked into the web3 storage client that we've made. This is a nice JS client. We've done for web3 storage as well.
01:00:30.500 - 01:01:06.990, Speaker A: We'll catch up the NFT storage client at some point. But at the moment you can see for storing files at least you just call like client put and then there's no mention of cars here. It just does that for you. It will create the dag, it will split the car up, it will upload, it will do retrying if it should fail, for example. Hopefully even easier than NFT storage. All right, so let's really quickly dive into the architecture. This is essentially a fork of NFT storage.
01:01:06.990 - 01:01:30.642, Speaker A: In the future, NFT storage might the back end to NFT storage might be web free storage. We'll see how that goes. But they are very similar at the moment, very similar. What happens is that users interact with the HTP API. They send car files and we put stuff into our IPFS cluster. That's cool. We have like a six node cluster.
01:01:30.642 - 01:01:54.650, Speaker A: We put stuff on at least three of those nodes in the cluster. So that's kind of cool. And we backup everything to Pinata. Pinata provides a pinning service, as you probably have come across if you've done any kind of IPFS stuff. And yeah, that's there the storage broker service. This is where all of the interesting stuff happens, basically. And what it does is it grabs all of the CIDs from our database.
01:01:54.650 - 01:02:20.486, Speaker A: Our database is called Fauna. No idea why. And anyway, so it batches them up into presents, or they're not really batches, they are aggregates of data. Essentially they are presents for miners and the presence are actually cars as well. Everything is cars. And what happens is that storage providers, they come and eat them up. Not really literally eat them, but they will take them because it's a self serve kind of thing.
01:02:20.486 - 01:02:50.938, Speaker A: They're like give me the deals and I store that data. Cool. Okay, last bit free. When we say free, we often get questions like why? How is this even possible? Well, let me tell you a little bit about how it works. This is essentially that bit in the bottom right hand corner of our diagram here. Just expand it out a bit. This is one particular storage provider who has some hard disks.
01:02:50.938 - 01:03:30.102, Speaker A: Anyway, so what happens is that storage providers commit their hard disk space to the filecoin network. They basically say they've got this capacity and they get like significant block rewards for doing so. And that's this kind of circular thing, because that happens essentially as the block progresses, they get rewards. And this translates into real world profits. Profits are down here, these money sacks at the bottom left, that happens. And that means that they're really incentivized to keep committing additional hard disk capacity to the network. So they keep doing that more and more just so that they can make more profit.
01:03:30.102 - 01:04:36.914, Speaker A: And of course, why wouldn't you do that? However, when the storage providers are storing data from users on the network, their likelihood of winning block rewards goes up by a big factor like ten X. So, wow, look at those profits they just raced up. So you can see the potential profits to be made here by storing real user data. And this is such a powerful incentive for filecoin storage providers to store data, such as the data that is coming from a free storage or NFT storage, that they're willing to offer free storage in order to get this block reward multiple. And in some cases, storage providers want to store data so badly that they'll actually pay users to store their data. So anyway, so as long as these block rewards continue to be really powerful incentive, which will be true for a long, long time, for example, like Bitcoin, block rewards are still an incentive for Bitcoin miners. Today storage should be free for all verified users on the filecoin network right now.
01:04:36.914 - 01:05:12.122, Speaker A: And so if it's free for us to store data on filecoin, then it's free for you to store data with us. If you want to learn more about the mechanics behind that and how to be a verified user, then if you go to the filecoin docs and then click on this, there'll be a link there for filecoin plus it's docs filecoin IO and you can find out how to do it. And that is mostly all I have to say. But thank you so much for listening and hopefully I haven't gone too far.
01:05:12.176 - 01:05:48.850, Speaker C: Over no, excellent job, excellent presentation as always. I want to encourage people to continue the chat in the discord. I know Alan covered a lot of topics today and I'm sure everyone's got a lot of questions on how to build with NFT Storage and web3 storage in their hacks over the next three weeks. Alan, thank you again. I want to introduce our next speaker, Jim. Jim works with the application research group, helps lead them at Protocol Labs. Needs no further introduction.
01:05:48.850 - 01:05:50.860, Speaker C: I'll let him take it away from here.
01:05:54.190 - 01:06:00.220, Speaker G: Hello, how's it going? Just share my screen.
01:06:05.490 - 01:06:06.062, Speaker C: So wow.
01:06:06.116 - 01:06:36.434, Speaker G: Yeah. Thank you for letting me present about Estuary at Hackath. I'm going to give a little walkthrough about this project we've been working on since around like April March. What is the arg, though? We're building application on top of amazing technologies in the Follicle ecosystem. And so it's me, it's Y, Chris, Elijah, a lot of ecosystem collaborations, to name a few. Textile fission, Arzora, a lot of people from Protocol Labs, a lot of technology that's made there is absolutely amazing. And we're hiring.
01:06:36.434 - 01:07:08.354, Speaker G: So maybe if you want to roll with us and make cool software, let me know what is suary. So I was thinking about how to describe Sgua, and I think it's a story for the most reliable way to upload public data to the filecoin network. And our methodology is we work in the open. So we're hoping that others take from our open source code and just learn and improve on it. I think we break it up into three parts. It's a hosted example of an Estuary node stack that anyone can run, and a documentation platform to discuss. And iterate with the community.
01:07:08.354 - 01:07:42.698, Speaker G: And it's a familiar place, I think, for IPFS devs who work with HTP. We support the IPFS pinning standard and I think we really try to improve on the filecoin storage deal experience. And I'll get into more of this later when I give a walkthrough of the features, but we reliably make deals against the followcoin network at six replication. So we make a ton of deals for better or for worse, and it's been a lot of fun. So we're running an S Ray node at HTPs estroy Tech. You can use any language you want to interface over hosted API. We configured it to be invite only.
01:07:42.698 - 01:08:22.434, Speaker G: We could change this in the future, but if you don't want to get an invite web3 storage, empty storage don't require this kind of gatekeeping, so you can use those today. We're testing optimal performance instructions and integrations. So as we make mistakes and as we get feedback, we will continue to iterate improve on what we're doing. And someday you'll be able to run your own node. And so here's some of the I guess the proof is in the pudding, or people want to see data and our performance. So we've put over 3 million files onto the filecoin network, over 3000 deals, over nine terabytes, over 29 terabytes of sealed storage on filecoin network. And we're working with 96 miners.
01:08:22.434 - 01:08:37.920, Speaker G: The goal is to work with a lot more if we want to. So we're curating miners and trying to figure out which miners we want to work with. And we have a couple of power users. One power user put over 2 million files. Another. Power user put over eight terabytes of data. And we're just testing the ceiling, seeing how far we can go.
01:08:37.920 - 01:09:12.146, Speaker G: And so I'm going to give a feature tour of what you can experience when you look through the website and kind of talk through some of the parts and then also go through a feature tour of what it's like to be a node operator and what you can see and manage. So we put commands everywhere. There are commands for everything all over our documentation, marketing pages. So we really want to show that this is like a developer tool that you can just kind of use without going to the GUI. The GUI is kind of like the least important part of the product, I think. You can just run these commands wherever you are. You can use Lotus to retrieve.
01:09:12.146 - 01:09:55.958, Speaker G: You don't have to use anything that we made. And we have clickable links everywhere, so you can see the files that you've uploaded. And so here's one from the marketing page. We think it's really important that you can verify your CID. So what I mean by verify your CID is that you want to know it's on filecoin and you want to know which miners that it's on specifically, and you want to be able to see details around that. And you also want to see a receipt for that storage deal so you know how long it's going to be on chain. And so we created an experience around this where you can basically make a deal, see the deal successful, see the start end date, see the collateral, see everything.
01:09:55.958 - 01:10:32.420, Speaker G: And I think that transparency makes file queen easy to understand. And we'll keep fine tuning this experience so people, I think, get a better grasp of what's happening with our data. We obviously want to add more, like what location the Miner is at, compliance. A lot of things for us to explore. We added upload via you know, there's a default way that you saw in the beginning of this presentation where you can just drag and drop files, but you can upload a CID as well upload via API. So our documentation is editable. You can upload files from the docs itself, so you can just copy and paste the curl command even, and do it from the command line.
01:10:32.420 - 01:11:10.574, Speaker G: We wanted to just be really open with all our process and make the whole thing a playground that people can play with. We do public performance analytics so you can see basically how well this node is doing in the public, so nothing's kept secret, even our failures. We keep a graph so everyone can see the performance. And we also keep a list of every single miner sorry, provider that we work with. And you can see the stats, deals and errors. And if you go here, you can see I'll skip ahead. You can see some of the logs that we help show.
01:11:10.574 - 01:11:50.934, Speaker G: So this makes it really easy to work with the providers on bugs and figure out what's going on. We can skip a meeting, makes things really quick. So we have a cool thing around batching. Batching is kind of an example of what happens when people are uploading like four kilobyte files or something really small, like small text files. We have a way to automatically batch that into a bigger deal. And the reason why we do that is because every miner or provider has in their maximum piece size, minimum piece size, kind of like a maximum they'll take and a minimum will take. So we're still experiencing the best way to do this, but we don't want to overload miners providers with a whole bunch of really small padded files.
01:11:50.934 - 01:12:16.420, Speaker G: So this is a great way for us to kind of batch things together and make a more valuable deal. And we provide the provider details on Estuary so there are public pages. And in the future we basically can show error logs, we can show price, we can even show like compliance and a whole bunch of other really cool things. And so see how much time I have left.
01:12:18.410 - 01:12:18.870, Speaker A: Cool.
01:12:18.940 - 01:12:59.230, Speaker G: So now to get into tools for network operators as we build out those things, for kind of like the client experience for network operators, we're focused on stress testing the capability of our node today. So whatever we achieve, we will provide the steps for you to do the same. And so horizontal scaling with Shuttles, it's a cool new invention. I'll get into that more later. Or you can talk to me about it. Offline block storage capacity eventually inventing new techniques to store more data on a single node faster writes and reads and built in filecoin address support. So you can run your own verified address and make deals on your own.
01:12:59.230 - 01:13:42.174, Speaker G: You can even just use a normal file coin address if you're willing to spend filecoin without making verified deals. And I think Alan covered that really well in his last talk. And if you want to talk more about verified addresses, we can talk about offline as well. And so one of the coolest things as a network operator when you're running your own Sjua in the future is that you can curate your preferred providers and you can see all the logs and have a relationship with them where you know why deals are failing or succeeding. And if there are problems. And you don't have to make deals against all of these providers, you can basically just suspend them for a little bit. It'll show up on their profile page and you can basically talk about the issues and then work through them together and then re enable them.
01:13:42.174 - 01:14:27.274, Speaker G: So I think this is kind of like a step in the right direction when it comes to a relationship between a client and a provider where we can debug things together and figure out what's the issue is. It data transfer, is it network issues, et cetera. You have a filecoin address if you run your own S Three node so you don't have to verify it. We have an address right here has a balance of filecoin and this address is for holding. We can move that amount to Escrow and whatever moves into Escrow gets used for making a ton of deals. You are in total control here and we'll add a lot of different features that make it so it's much more manageable. You can set limits, you can maybe even limit by user.
01:14:27.274 - 01:15:17.200, Speaker G: And so we're still exploring this and we have great ecosystem partners that we're working with to help figure all this stuff out. Shuttles are like a really cool invention. I know that there are a lot of clients out there that have a ton of data. It's just not easy to move sometimes petabytes over to wire and you probably shouldn't because if you're using the cloud, you probably pay for network ingress on that and it's going to be very expensive. And so shell is like an option before offline deals where if you really don't want to do an offline deal, what you could do is you could have us create a shuttle really close to you and then you could upload your data directly there and maybe save on some of the ingress cost. And so we're experimenting with this right now and it's been great. It's actually helped people who are in Europe upload a ton of data instead of going through US East One or whatever.
01:15:17.200 - 01:16:05.366, Speaker G: There's a lot of user debugging tools that we're going to be releasing as well. So network operators can debug problems for clients by impersonating them. I was kind of hesitant to show this feature because I think it puts a lot of responsibility on the network operator to be a good actor. But at the same time we've had users that have really stress tested Estuary and it was really nice to be able to go into their account with their permission if they gave us their API key and kind of like find the bugs at a million files and see why things aren't paginating correctly. And when you run your S ray node, you can actually make your S ray node open to everyone or you can make your S ray node as a service, like an invite only. And so we chose to be invite only for now. And so you can see this page where we can generate invite keys and we can invite other admins.
01:16:05.366 - 01:16:48.166, Speaker G: So right now S Three is actually being managed by a few other people to create invites and allow people to come use the product. The last thing I think is one thing that's really cool about running this Estuary node is that you can also see the hardware system analytics. And so this is a really bad screenshot. It doesn't show all of the details, but I really want to know how things fail. I think that's like a great step forward to figuring out how to improve your product. And so we keep track of the failures, we check the deals attempted and we also have hardware stats so you know how much hard drive space is being provided by the box that you're using. I think as we fine tune this, we'll give users a lot of control over how they want to run their S rate notes.
01:16:48.166 - 01:17:36.140, Speaker G: So hypothetically, you could run one on a cheaper machine somewhere and as long as you curate your providers and users in a certain way and set expectations, you can even support filecoin deals that way without having to have a super robust system that we have. And so, yeah, that's pretty much a quick overview of all of S tray. Hopefully I didn't go through it too fast, but if you have any questions about it, you can ask me and I'm going to play actually a little teaser of what's to come in the future. So we are making videos to describe some of the technology that we're creating to make Estuary work. And so in the future you'll see videos from the application research team that will look like this and they'll have a lot of different examples of.
01:17:39.630 - 01:17:39.994, Speaker B: How.
01:17:40.032 - 01:18:23.180, Speaker G: To use the product, how to get an invitation. I think what we actually really need are more technical deep dives. So we'll probably do some more deep dives on the stack and how to run your own and all the different modules that we've built such as like Fill Client and et cetera. So stay tuned for more videos that kind of walk through how the product is used and how the stack works and kind of like even some discussions around what direction we should go in the future. Yeah, I placed through that pretty fast. Stay tuned and happy to field any questions now.
01:18:28.190 - 01:18:52.530, Speaker C: Thank you for that, an excellent presentation. If we have some questions, give me one SEC. We're all sort of interested to know next steps and big plans for the team. Let me see if we have some questions from the audience.
01:18:53.190 - 01:19:25.114, Speaker G: Yeah, so one thing that we do want to get to is by sometime in the future, we want to make it easy to send petabytes of data to the filecoin network. And so I think that's going to be a really hard challenge and very rewarding. I think there isn't a lot of tools right now that make it easy. And so we have workarounds today in the ecosystem that are really brilliant, but it would be nice to have like a fire and forget solution where you can send that much data to the filecoin network and we'll keep experiencing playing until we get sure for sure.
01:19:25.232 - 01:19:43.938, Speaker C: I know this is pretty specific to the event itself, but we've got a lot of hackers here, some of them completely new to this space looking for things to build and looking for ways to build with Estuary. Suggestions for them, I guess, would be important. Do you have anything off the top of your mind that you would give to a new hacker here?
01:19:44.104 - 01:19:44.434, Speaker F: Yeah.
01:19:44.472 - 01:20:19.242, Speaker G: So I would say that if you're a new hacker, don't feel too intimidated by what you see. I wrote a tutorial. I'm not the best writer in the world, but I wrote a tutorial here where you can actually play with the whole API right here in the code. So you can change this to change the code and play with it, and you need an API key. And I'm not going to go and get one because I don't want to expose that on the screen right now. But you can basically go through this three step API and see how easy it is to upload files to Estuary. And you don't have to use JavaScript.
01:20:19.242 - 01:21:03.546, Speaker G: So if you are a python, dev a ruby, dev a godev, whatever, you can just use our API over Http and you can integrate into your application without installing a module. So I think that makes it a little bit easier. If you were worried that you had to learn a front end language or learn JavaScript to participate in the hackathon, or you had to build a beautiful GUI, you can actually use the whole API from the command line. I would love to know if it doesn't work out well. So there's a little bit of a feedback form right here, and this feedback goes straight to me. So if you write anything, you write here. Be nice or be kind, I guess, but you can write feedback here and it will go straight to me and we can have a conversation about it.
01:21:03.546 - 01:21:15.806, Speaker G: And I'm more than willing to help you and solve this problem. So if you're a new hacker, I have a lot of time to help. So let me know your questions and I'll be more than willing to help you get awesome.
01:21:15.908 - 01:21:16.270, Speaker H: Awesome.
01:21:16.340 - 01:21:32.534, Speaker C: Well, thank you. I think we're a bit ahead of schedule right now. I want to thank Jimmy for your time, obviously, but we're going to take it to a break for just a second. So if you want to stay, stick around and enjoy some low fi beats. We'll be back shortly right where we left off.
01:21:32.652 - 01:21:33.318, Speaker A: Cool.
01:21:33.484 - 01:21:34.520, Speaker G: See you guys.
01:32:41.700 - 01:32:57.536, Speaker C: All right. And we're back. I want to thank everybody for their patience. We're bringing in another guest for our next presentation. Daniel. Heyman. Dan is the co founder and CEO of Palm NFT Studio.
01:32:57.536 - 01:33:13.130, Speaker C: Prior to that, he led protocols group at Consensus. They built a variety of ethereum related protocol efforts. Dan, if you're with us, it'd be great to have you step up on stage and hear a little bit more about what you do and get a better intro than I can give you.
01:33:13.900 - 01:33:14.312, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:33:14.366 - 01:33:41.292, Speaker B: Thanks so much, Luke. Hi, everyone. Super excited to be here and chatting with you all. So let me share screen, get some pretty visuals for you. So very quick, just intro as to who I am. As Luke said, I'm the co founder of Palm NFT Studio. Palm NFT Studio develops NFT projects on the Palm side chain.
01:33:41.292 - 01:34:28.512, Speaker B: And today I'm mostly going to talk about the Palm Side chain, why we think it's interesting, who some of our partners are in that effort, including Protocol Labs, how you might proceed building on it. Then I'll talk a little bit about the studio because I'm a co founder and can't help a little bit of shameless self promotion by way of background. So, as Luke said, I spent the last four years at Consensus. I sort of grew the Protocol engineering group there from about two people to 60, 65, where it is today. We have an ethereum One implementation called Hyperledger Basu. Hyperledger Basu is actually the foundation of Palm as well. We have an Ethereum Two implementation called Teku, which I also encourage you to check out.
01:34:28.512 - 01:35:21.884, Speaker B: And then we have an enterprise ethereum implementation called Consensus Quorum that has something like 30% of the overall enterprise blockchain market. And when I was at Consensus building these sort of production grade, enterprise grade solutions for JPMorgan or Mastercard or some of the other clients, it occurred to me that that same technology supposed publicly could solve some of the challenges that NFTs have in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm a big believer in the Ethereum ecosystem. I want to keep projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. And so there's that background and consensus that sort of led to the creation of Palm and Palm NFT Studio before getting more technical. I think it's always interesting to stop and think where NFTs are today and where they might be going. A lot of people have different views on the future of NFTs.
01:35:21.884 - 01:36:02.060, Speaker B: What will be valuable. We've seen some incredibly successful projects from crypto native art to NBA TOPSHOTS top of the list in terms of capturing existing IP and leveraging this new technology to expand it. We've seen some really exciting projects. Like Axio Infinity and Zed Runs do native games with blockchain. I think there's a ton of innovation and a ton of uncharted territory still ahead for us. My personal belief is that in three to five years, the vast majority of NFTs will be given away for free. They will be fan activation, fan engagement, fan rewards.
01:36:02.060 - 01:36:53.040, Speaker B: And we're going to use NFTs still as collectibles a little bit. And crypto art will still be important, always be important. But the thrust of it will be really the connection point between creator and fan and the activation point between creator and fan. And that looks a bit different than the way NFTs are largely thought about today, or at least implemented today. And it also premises on the fact that it's just as important for existing brands as crypto native brands. And so a lot of what we do at Palm NFT studio is trying to work with leading artists, creators, brands on how they can use this technology and evolve. That's sort of the background in our thesis.
01:36:53.040 - 01:37:29.852, Speaker B: We launched Palm, the side chain sort of soft launch, eight weeks ago. Now it's gotten increasing usage over the last couple of weeks. In particular, last week we saw the first major projects on it. Sort of got to see some major throughput on the system, which is exciting. There are a few fundamental design principles that we wanted to solve with BOM. But first, of course, scalability. Everyone needs to scale the solution, particularly if we think high volume NFTs are going to be the future.
01:37:29.852 - 01:38:22.264, Speaker B: Gas fees are of course a challenge with Ethereum. But the one that surprised me most in terms of customer feedback or what brands and IP owners and creators are looking for, is the environmentally friendly angle. I've sort of been heads deep in the crypto space for a while and in the crypto space we talk about sustainability, we talk about the importance of it, but it generally seems like it's more of a secondary concern. But for creators, for artists, for brands, for consumers, it's very much, and rightfully so, a primary concern. And so we wanted to design a chain that could sort of meet the needs of sustainable brands and sustainable customers. That said, we wanted all this to live within the Ethereum ecosystem. So I believe deeply in ethereum.
01:38:22.264 - 01:38:52.304, Speaker B: I think that is my bias. I think Ethereum brings the most innovation, the most developers, the most tooling, the most existing projects. And so we also wanted to make sure everything was as compatible as possible with Ethereum. So that's sort of what we set out to do. In practice, what this means is we set up a network based on Hyperledger Beisu. Hyperledger. Beisu is a ethereum client.
01:38:52.304 - 01:39:26.348, Speaker B: You could use it to run Ethereum mainnet nodes if you want, and a number of people do. But it also has a consensus mechanism that you could swap out for alternative purposes. And one of the consensus mechanisms you can put in place of proof of work is a variant of the PBFT family. This one is called IBFT or Qbft. And to skip the jargon, it's rotating proof of authority. So it requires a trusted, validator pool. That's sort of the downside in terms of decentralization.
01:39:26.348 - 01:40:08.910, Speaker B: And for that downside you get a number of benefits. You get a chain that's fully EVM compatible. You get a chain that has low and predictable gas fees high throughput at around sort of 100 to 300 transactions per second today. But we know how to scale that much more. We've scaled the solution all the way up to 10,000 transactions per second and then fast deposit and withdrawal from Ethereum. So our bridge, which is live, has sort of hit some production I call speed bumps in the last few days. But the fastest transactions are going over the bridge in under 15 minutes, even under five minutes, and we're targeting all transactions going on the bridge in under 15 minutes moving forward.
01:40:08.910 - 01:40:51.790, Speaker B: And so these are all nice properties, the other nice property. And the thing that's sort of implicit in all this is that the technology is not brand new. This isn't sort of technology we're testing, so to speak. The core protocol is something that we've deployed a number of times in production, which is pretty awesome. And the other point here is this is a collaborative effort with a number of folks. So Palm NFC studio is obviously invested in the success of Palma network, but we're far from the only one here's. Just a few projects I wanted to call out because I know they're dev tools, they're super important.
01:40:51.790 - 01:41:54.784, Speaker B: Protocol Labs has been a supporter of Palm from day one. All the NFTs are currently out on Palm are stored via IPFS and Filecoin, and we're continuing to part collaboration for decentralized storage solutions. Infura hosts Palm and hosts an IPFS instance. And so you can use Inferior's pinning service and other things like NFT storage on Palm. Today consensus is one of the leading validators on the network through Infira, which exposes the APIs truffle integrates very nicely into Palm as well. I don't want to go too deep here, but there's about a dozen sort of key projects that are already launching on Palm. And sort of as we roll out our network, it's really exciting and validating our hypothesis that staying as close to the Ethereum ecosystem is really important.
01:41:54.784 - 01:42:40.540, Speaker B: And we're starting to see that take up at the beginning. And so what do I mean by Ethereum compatibility? So there's a bunch of layers of the stack, probably one, if we're being honest, missing from this diagram in terms of data APIs, maybe. But the nice thing about Pom, since it runs Hyperledger Beisu, it's literally the same EVM that could process mainnet. So all the opcodes are supported. It's the same API interfaces. It's also hosted by Inferior, so it can be the same infrastructure. We've had projects tell us it's a matter of an hour and a half to fully transition their product from Ethereum to Palm.
01:42:40.540 - 01:43:27.560, Speaker B: And that's pretty remarkable. So you can redeploy your smart contracts, the solidity code will work, you can connect to the same inferior API, endpoints with just different chain ID. And then, just as importantly, the NFTs that you mint on one chain can move across the other and vice versa. Currently, our bridge only supports 721, but we're planning to add additional support on the bridge. And so that's an ongoing effort and something that's really important to us. So I've said this a few times, that sort of high level compatibility with Ethereum is an absolutely core design principle for us and something we think is super important. So just to reiterate this, if you want more info, there's docs.
01:43:27.560 - 01:43:54.912, Speaker B: Palm IO. They're getting started. You can also join our Discord, which is available via our website, palm IO. The concept behind Palm and sort of the tech stack is really simple. It's an EVM compatible side chain. It uses rotating proof of authority to get scalability. It's hosted by Infira, it's got a bridge back to Mainnet, and we are having an increasing number of third party projects deploy.
01:43:54.912 - 01:44:28.668, Speaker B: There's one thing I mentioned, should have mentioned that I didn't yet. It's also really important to us. Side chain requires a native token, Palm to pay gas. But we're not selling it, we're not trying to make money off it. We're giving it away for free to developers and projects who need the token to do things on chain. And we're also asking those partners to give it away for free to their users so they can do things on chain. The real goal of this token is to be a utility token to pay gas in the future, govern the network.
01:44:28.668 - 01:45:01.492, Speaker B: It is not something that we're trying to monetize. And so if you want access to that faucet, or want any information like any access to that, you can find some information on Docs.com IO. I'll also give out my email at the end of this so you can get started. Yeah, so that's sort of the Whirlwind. Pretty brief technical overview. Stepping away from the technical bit, I wanted to talk also a little bit about Palm NFT Studio, which is sort of the company I lead, palm, the sidechain is an open network.
01:45:01.492 - 01:45:31.110, Speaker B: It's hosted by Infuria Consensus funds a bunch of nodes I O builders, Nifties. We've got a bunch more people bringing nodes on board. Palm NFT Studio is a company committed to deploying projects on. You know, you can think of ourselves as sort of part creative studio and part technical layer API company. So the most recent project we did was in collaboration with Hemi. You can go to Henny.com to see more here.
01:45:31.110 - 01:46:22.548, Speaker B: I don't know how many in this audience are familiar with Damien Hurst. Damien is by many measures one of the most successful contemporary fine artists. And he made 10,000 physical pieces of art back in 2016. Around the concept of art being currency. We usually think of art as this thing we sort of stick on our wall and it stays there and it can't move. And he was wondering, well, can art actually be exchanged more often and traded more often? And he did this before NFTs were really a thing. And so when we were talking to him, he had this brilliant idea of using NFTs as the way to run this experiment and test whether these NFT, whether artwork could be exchanged like this, how people will use it, how people interact with it.
01:46:22.548 - 01:46:56.828, Speaker B: We love the project because it uses the technology to extend and expand what is capable with the artwork. And right now we're posing to all users a really interesting question all owners. A really interesting question. So if you own Damien Hurst NFT, you have one year to burn the Nft@henny.com. The burning option will go live in like two months. But once that option is live, you'll have one year to burn the NFT and claim the physical. If you don't burn the NFT and claim the physical, after one year, the physical will be burned and you're stuck with the digital.
01:46:56.828 - 01:47:26.904, Speaker B: So it's kind of asking the question, do people care more for the digital and the physical? And I'm very interested to see the data that comes back. I personally plan to keep mine in the digital. I've heard a lot of people want to buy two so they can have one of each. It would be an interesting experiment. We were able to sell, obviously, 10,000 of them. We had 30 35,000 people apply for over 70,000 NFTs. The second year market in the last week has been really robust, both on Henny.com
01:47:26.904 - 01:47:58.710, Speaker B: on the Palm side and on Openc on the main net side. And for this one, Palm NFT Studio obviously did none of the creative. Damien Hearst did all the creative, but we worked with them to design the project and help implement the drop, which we're really proud of. The other project we did recently was sort of the opposite in terms of Palm NFT Studios role. It was collaboration with Warner Brothers and Nifties.com. Nifties.com sort of was the site and the experience that this happened through.
01:47:58.710 - 01:48:36.012, Speaker B: They did the technical implementation and design of the game, and Palm NFT Studio was responsible for the creative assets like the visual NFTs and what you see. And we're really proud of this one as well. So there were two rounds of drops. The first round, 90,000 NFTs were claimed and sold within a number of hours. The second round, I think the number was into the six figures. So it was one of the largest NFT projects in terms of number of NFTs, number of users engaging with those NFTs. I think these two projects are good examples of our capabilities.
01:48:36.012 - 01:49:17.512, Speaker B: So we've got deep technical ability to implement new projects, but we want to marry that with deep creative capabilities that can do justice and really showcase existing brands. For us, this technology will go mainstream when major brands are using it to extend what they can do. Major brands will only do that when they think the technology will do justice to their work. And so having that world class creative team is absolutely crucial to our vision as well. And so I was told to speak for about 20 minutes. I think that was 19, so not so bad. You can find us on Palm IO docs or Docs pom IO.
01:49:17.512 - 01:49:51.130, Speaker B: There's the discord, so everyone has it. My email is Dan D-A-N at Palm IO. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. I feel compelled to make the plug that we. Are hiring in all departments everywhere. So creative product, technical content, if you're backend engineer, full stack engineer, front end DevOps, tech writer we have a ton of open roles. If you don't see an open role that meets your profile but you're still interested in working with us, email me.
01:49:51.130 - 01:49:58.730, Speaker B: We'd love to receive that email. And with that, let me take a sip of water and see if there's any questions.
01:50:03.920 - 01:50:57.740, Speaker C: Thank you. Excellent presentation. I'm always excited to see I know we're all excited to see new NFT projects. It's such a vibrant space right now, especially bringing in the traditional art world into the distributed art world and seeing the alignments and synergies. Take a few questions here. I'll see if we have any in the chat first, but if not, I know we have a diverse set of hackers here today, a lot of which are new to the space, a few of which have come to our events before, looking for ideas on how to leverage NFTs for their projects right now. What are some interesting developments, do you think, in the NFT space right now that you think that they could potentially work off of for their project in Packfs?
01:51:01.760 - 01:51:43.070, Speaker B: I think there's a bunch of cool things going on. We can give ideas, I mean, the party that happened yesterday to sort of buy the alien punk or sort of I forget how many people, but like a few hundred people each chipped in a little bit of ETH to make a giant bid. I think that was a really interesting experiment on how communities can engage in the NFT space for collectibles. But for me the most interesting thing is happening with NFTs that are outside the collectible space. So some of that is being pioneered by Axie and Zedron and others in terms of the play to earn space. I think the Space Jam project is really interesting. It's sort of a marketing activation space.
01:51:43.070 - 01:52:20.810, Speaker B: And so I'm sure there are hackers in your audience who have tons of different backgrounds, understand what their companies would want to achieve with a new media. And if we think of NFT as a new media, new way to extend content and reach, you can start to get pretty creative about how to do things and also how to connect traditional media and new media. So I would love to see projects that sort of do real world crossovers much more that have sort of multimedia storytelling much more. I think that'll be some of the more interesting innovations that we'll have moving forward.
01:52:21.820 - 01:53:09.980, Speaker C: Definitely interested to see how the sort of art as currency idea sort of takes hold. I want to thank you again for your presentation and encourage people to connect you on Discord and in the ways you've listed. I'm going to bring up our second speaker we have following this Ilya. Ilya, if you're ready to go, we can get this going. 1 second ilya is the co founder of Near Protocol, which is celebrating three years, by the way. Prior to that, he was with Deep Learning Research and led a team at Google working on deep learning research. Ilya, whenever you're ready, we can get this started.
01:53:09.980 - 01:53:12.170, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:53:12.320 - 01:53:50.698, Speaker F: Thanks, Luke. Hello everyone. It's great to be here and I'm excited to see all your hacks when the hacks ends. Yeah, wanted to talk today about open web, what it is and kind of how to hack for it, I guess. Let me share my screen and we can start while we're here. We actually started in August, pretty much six to eight, I guess, near. So it is actually three years since we started.
01:53:50.698 - 01:54:55.694, Speaker F: I'm really excited about this journey. So let me kind of first introduce a little bit about open web. Generally when we're thinking about web, right, all of us are using it, all of us are using the word, but what is this actually? Right? And actually VAB was one of the protocols of the kind of Internet in general. So when just Internet was kind of starting, there was like ARPANET all those networks and there was a set of open protocols that people were using to communicate using these networks. And email is actually one of the few protocols that survived kind of through this time. Then the web came and web was really this idea of how do we kind of exchange information, how do we link to it and share content and do this thing? And so this was kind of in 89 it started out and then for a while we had this idea of yellow pages and Internet and all this kind of basic stuff. Let's put information on Internet and everybody will be able to have access to it.
01:54:55.694 - 01:55:58.980, Speaker F: And then about in 97, 88, when Amazon, Google and kind of few other big companies were starting, this idea of interactive web came in, right, this idea that you can actually interact with these applications. You can actually able to put in information and see relevant links, or you can put information into stay there. And this is where we have social, we have all those things. But with that, we kind of lost some of this open protocol ideas. We kind of lost a lot of the spirits behind the original Internet. And instead we started to kind of give a lot of power to these big companies that are providing us the services, right? So we kind of became almost like both customers, but in many cases products of the services. And with that you have user data acquisition, you have data leaks that's been happening all this time because you have this central honeypot place where all of your data is, and it's been sold, it's been stolen, and it's been used in all kinds of ways.
01:55:58.980 - 01:57:13.180, Speaker F: And so what we have kind of nowadays is this resurgence of the protocol idea, of the ideas of how do we build something that doesn't require this kind of centralized provider that will be exploiting this data and exploiting this usage, but really kind of bringing it back to the original ideals. Now in parallel, there has been a growth of blockchain, right? And it started with just money. It started with this idea, with a simple idea how do we make a peer to peer money where nobody is in the middle, where nobody's in control except the people who actually hold their money. And this is where Bitcoin was born. But as we saw in past few years, kind of this idea of well actually you can build more than just pure transactional money. You can actually have a full financial system. You can have all of kind of programmable types of applications that leverage money as one of the components and use the same technology, use the blockchain, use this trustless layer to really start building something that now we know as DeFi or openfi that really transforms almost how people kind of operate with money.
01:57:13.180 - 01:58:05.034, Speaker F: And so open web. Kind of from one side we have this pattern of people trying to go away from this big centralized companies that are operating and from the other side we have this technology kind of pattern, right? Of well, actually, we have now a trustless. No intermediary protocols and systems to build. On top of which, we can actually build this open web. And so for me, this is where these two things meet, right? Because a lot of people have been trying to build, for example, like Mastodon and other protocols, open protocols, even the instant messaging protocols, but none of them succeeded because they were building them in vacuum. They were just trying to build a protocol and they didn't have this kind of trustless layer and financial incentive layer on the bottom. So that's where we are.
01:58:05.034 - 01:58:55.786, Speaker F: And so what is actually Open Web, right? What is this concept? And people call it Web Three as well. But Open Web is really this idea of there's this set of philosophies that people follow when they build applications, right? And decentralization is one of those philosophies. There's really this idea that you don't want to have a single center, single server, single party that is able to control the whole system. You don't want to be able to bring it down or leak data or whatever. You also want kind of this idea of composability, right? Because when we think of Google's and Facebook's, they always provided some kind of API. You can always use their service, but they control it. And they are really only give you a fraction of things that you can build that you can use from their service.
01:58:55.786 - 02:00:04.046, Speaker F: If you working inside, actually inside everything is very composable. So I worked at Google and inside Google actually feels like a huge open source environment where you can just take a little bit of here, a little bit of there, compose it and launch a new application and this idea, but actually in a permissionless open to everyone way is the spirit here. You definitely want it to be open, right? You don't need to pass an interview to Google to be able to do this stuff. Or there's some kind of guards that like, oh, if you're from this country, whatever is the property that people like to discriminate on, you don't want any of that. And this is very hard to achieve, right? You want it to be user first. And this is where if you think of companies, companies is never user first, right? Its values are always driven towards kind of company internally. And so if you're building company, it's really hard to be user first, however they say because user for you is just a source of income, right? And so you're just trying to kind of figure out how to extract that income from them.
02:00:04.046 - 02:00:51.674, Speaker F: And then in kind of the spirit of blockchain, this is where you own your keys, you own your money, you own whatever that is. And so we want more of that. We want more ability of users actually owning their data, owning their governance, and being able to decide for themselves what they want. And obviously underneath you need markets and you need economy because this is a driver like this is the ability to actually invest in innovation, achieve it and kind of sustain it over time if we have ability to create the economy. So I have this very messy graph, I can zoom in a little bit for a second. And so this is just to show you. I like to say this is the idea that there's always a plan somewhere.
02:00:51.674 - 02:02:12.294, Speaker F: So kind of the idea is that when we started out with blockchain, there's a lot of components that go into building a blockchain. Storage, networking, sharding, executions and all those things. But blockchain is just a small component, right? And when we look at it, there's a lot of kind of infrastructure that goes into it, but then there's a lot of applications and protocols that you build on top. And I'll kind of go over basic stuff, but you have a whole slew of financial applications, you have a whole slew of infrastructure and index and stuff. And so this is just an idea that as we are developing this, there's a lot of things that are in progress and there's a lot of things to be built and this is actually a call for hackers to actually go and hack some of the stuff. So let me kind of explain what we already have, right, as we, I mean the whole space, right? We have actually set of primitives that are very powerful, that are actually enable a number of things if you combine them in the right ways. So we have a programmable ownership, we have a way to program ownership of some digital information, some digital data that can be money, can be data, can be hashes of some data on filecoin.
02:02:12.294 - 02:03:15.622, Speaker F: This can be NFTs, this can be actually something that maps to a real world, to a real world item and you can program it in kind of unlimited ways, right? You can say like well, if it's Thursday and you try to transfer, it actually will transfer to somebody else, right? You can do whatever you want. And this is something that's not possible to do in normal kind of programming. This is not something that you are able to program banks to do stuff or program ownership databases to do stuff in such kind of powerful way. We have this pseudonymous identity. Identity is important because it allows people to obviously to build reputation, to accrue kind of information, to have the ownership. But pseudonymous means also people can have multiple of them that are kind of exposing different angles of this thing and obviously privacy and ability to really kind of perform things that otherwise maybe it will be harder to do. We have encryption and proxy encryption.
02:03:15.622 - 02:04:15.950, Speaker F: And if you're not familiar with proxy encryption, re encryption is this idea that if I encrypt some data, I could actually allow you to have access to it through a set of kind of cryptographic primitives and set of nodes without anybody else kind of having access to it and me needing to redownload this data. And so this allows now to share data in kind of different ways with different parties via pretty much trustless protocols. Obviously, we have decentralized storage, I mean, we have filecoin here and a few other solutions. We have oracles. Oracles are actually a very powerful concept because they bring the information from off chain on chain and we need this information to do both economic and non economic decisions. A really cool concept is zero knowledge proofs, right? His ability to prove something, that this is an outcome of some computation without actually redoing the whole computation. And it's pure magic, but it actually works.
02:04:15.950 - 02:05:19.134, Speaker F: And now we are able to do this in new interesting ways. And the thing I'm really excited about is kind of decentralized autonomous organizations is this idea of organizing people around the world in novel ways, this completely novel ways, and still being able to have access to all the programmable ownership, to economy, to finances, to all those things kind of through this new level, right? Think of it as if company is kind of a legacy style. Dows is a way to kind of program a company that is global and can have all the same features or whatever else you want different. And it allows us to kind of create this new organization that are impossible to do before. So all those are primitives that are already here. You can use them today and you can build novel applications. So, how do we have this? Well, actually, because we have all this infrastructure built, right? So we have scalable blockchains that allow you to kind of have this ownership, have this identities and kind of things around that you have indexing and querying.
02:05:19.134 - 02:06:31.076, Speaker F: This is kind of one of the blobs there on the chart where you are able to actually connect your front end to the nodes kind of in an easy way, get the data that they need and all those things. We have scalable storage chains like Filecoin, we have economically secured Oracles which allow you to trust like as a smart contract, you can trust the data that comes in with some economic guarantees. And we have new ways of kind of getting people in, right? The gateways and exchanges are allowed for a person who never seen crypto to actually start using it and being able to kind of onboard into this. So all this is already here. These components are kind of built and it's now about how do we combine them. So the other side of this is really reimagining how we're doing things. Because when you build things in the kind of web, two, if you build a SaaS or if you build a consumer app, there's a set of ways how you usually would build an application, how you build a company, right? You would have a marketing budget, you would go out to buy Facebook ads and YouTube ads.
02:06:31.076 - 02:07:54.852, Speaker F: You would figure out how to get your app installed on all kinds of phones through ads, in other games or in other applications. But it's not really how you would do it in kind of open web because you now have this one of the pieces, one of the components you have is ownership itself. You can actually kind of program ownership of your company, of your project, of application you're building and you can use it to do all kinds of stuff, right? So the simplest thing is really about building a community around application who will become your most loyal fans, who will be also owners of this application through various ways and through that they actually will become your marketers and your influencers and your community members who will go out and bring more users. And so this is, I call it the usage mining, this idea that what you want to do, you want to really align the way people use your networks, the way your application or network is growing in a value. And you really just allow people to get ownership by doing that. And like in DeFi, a lot of it is called liquidity mining because liquidity is the way to kind of grow the network. But this can be anything.
02:07:54.852 - 02:09:11.548, Speaker F: This can be a social graph where the social graph is its value is kind of the number of connections. And so you can actually align around growing the number of connections as a network and receive kind of value around that. And at the same time you have kind of this ownership now becomes it transforms how people think about the applications and kind of how they associate themselves with, right? A good example have been in Toronto. A taxi company actually used this idea and they aligned their usage finding around drivers driving the taxi, right? And so drivers became so kind of embedded into this application, they became the biggest fans. They kept selling this app to their customers, to their friends, to kind of everyone who wants to listen because it aligned both them receiving income and ownership in this application, which know in a way captures future income of the system. And so that app before pandemic have outperformed Uber in Toronto because of kind of really aligning these networks. And so you have this novel ways to really build applications that are almost impossible to build before.
02:09:11.548 - 02:10:24.880, Speaker F: Because you can be global, you can be kind of using these primitives, and you can create new ways of actually aligning. People to really push this application, grow this application without kind of building a marketing machine, without building all of the things that we kind of usually do in our sales machine in web two. So what's next? Right? I kind of talked about primitives. We have infrastructure, we have this new base. So what's missing, right, why is my phone doesn't have all the apps are using open web. And so the thing that's missing right now, right? And this is again excerpt from that graph is a set of common protocols that would connect kind of just basic primitives and what the applications will be at the end, right? So few of the protocols that I believe that needs to be built kind of incoming year or years are social graph, right? Like if you think of it when we right now using on Facebook, it's on Store, on Facebook, then you go on LinkedIn, it's like its own social graph. And so you have like every single app has its own social graph.
02:10:24.880 - 02:11:35.788, Speaker F: And so having a common social graph protocol, right, where kind of for your identity or identities even you have your friends, you have your followers, you have your kind of work colleagues and it doesn't matter which app you. Go but it's connected to your identity and it's encrypted to you and it's kind of yours and you're just allowing apps to use it when you are interacting with them pretty much would allow kind of open up a huge set of use cases and huge set of applications. Communication is another one is really kind of creating communication channels between multiparty. Right now we again relying even with all the signals and telegrams which are supposed to be encrypted and everything, we're still relying on a centralized party to deliver our messages. Even though underneath we have internet that is decentralized. And again the decentralized communication protocols have existed, they just never actually beat the centralized one because they're always kind of lost in this investment protocol game. And now we have an opportunity to build these protocols that are incentivized to be kind of growing music and video and kind of across all the content.
02:11:35.788 - 02:12:45.724, Speaker F: There's a lot of kind of opportunity to really reimagine and have a common protocol that musicians and videographers and all those people, they right now are receiving a smallest portion of the income that they can be receiving from their fans. Right? And NFTs is one way to connect them. But really there is a lot to do on the basic stuff as well. Certification and reputation is just the ability to track around identity of the person, like the pseudonymous identity or even kind of some identifier of an object certifying that something is true or not, that creates a huge set of things where if you can rely on this, then the next set of applications become way easier to use. And so figuring out the protocols that are reliable, that others can build on is huge. The really cool one is conflict resolution. If we have conflict resolution that can work between two pseudonymous identities, right, we pretty much have a court kind of what we have in the government that is able to kind of make decisions around facts.
02:12:45.724 - 02:13:43.830, Speaker F: Like it doesn't matter who is behind that identity, it doesn't matter kind of what is the history there, it just matters what's this conflict and what's the facts that were predating this specific thing. And maybe reputation, obviously, and maybe some other things. But we're removing all those biases that we right now have in the core system. We're removing a lot of kind of places where people can make mistakes and now we're really kind of simplifying it to a core primitive. And another one that I really like is work scheduling is really ability for people to kind of post some job, grab some job. And so this actually requires a conflict resolution because what if they didn't do it. And so that's kind of, I mean, here in the graph you see some of the linkage of these protocols because they all kind of connect at the end.
02:13:43.830 - 02:14:29.376, Speaker F: So this is like set of protocols that I believe we should be building. And again, this is a call for hackers to go out and build them. And if you are building this, reach out to me. I would love to kind of work with you and support you and figure out how we can launch this. So I was talking kind of from perspective of technology, I was talking from perspective of building stuff. But what does this mean for users, right? Because as a user we mentioned before, you want self sovereignty, you want the control, right? And so here this idea is that user now is in the center, right? You have all these protocols kind of around you and you're able to really interact with them. And it doesn't matter which kind of front end you're using.
02:14:29.376 - 02:15:50.190, Speaker F: You always have access to your data, you always have access to your information, to your social graph, to all those things to your communities and you're able to really drive kind of usage and drive through this owning of a little bit pieces of this protocol drive where they evolve as well. And so this is really powerful for users because between Facebook that constantly changes rules or like Instagram removing like button for South America here you have this ability to really if somebody built a better interface for image sharing using the same social protocol, awesome, tomorrow everybody flogged there. And people who didn't flog, they still see because they're using the same protocol, they can still see the same stuff, they just maybe don't see all of the information that new app is using. So you now have this ability for users to choose and to really kind of drive because of this usage to the applications that are the best instead of kind of the centralized platform. It's also very powerful for creators, right? A lot of creators right now, and I mentioned Instagram because that's one of the complaints. They are kind of stuck in the platform they are in. Right? And usually these platforms also use all kinds of ways to kind of restrict them from doing things.
02:15:50.190 - 02:16:56.720, Speaker F: And so we already see in Blockchain that creators love it, right? Part of it is because there is this concept of royalties, meaning that as things get resold or get reused, they receiving kind of a percentage of the future value that's been transacted back to them. And this is something that obviously none of the platforms do and none of the physical items have ability to do that. But we can see this kind of going beyond because now creators have a direct audience that they can connect to. There's a way to interact with them in more direct ways and get feedback and get engagement, right? And so this is also like the topic here is like passion economy. There's a lot of kind of exciting stuff happening there even outside of Blockchain. But this concept of really connecting them together, of a user, of end user and the creator through NFTs, through the content, through the platforms that kind of engage them, is definitely something that both sides want. And we see already this happening across discords across these platforms.
02:16:56.720 - 02:18:16.792, Speaker F: And for developers, you have this ability to kind of mix and match pretty much already on top of existing stuff, right? Like where before you would need to you launch an app, it's like zero users, zero data, and now you need to start building stuff. Here you launch an app, every single user of the platform already is your user, right? They maybe didn't do anything yet. You already have connections to a lot of data from other applications and now you just combine it into new experiences, create incentives, create community, and it kind of propels it. And DFI in general showcased this kind of for specific slice of use cases, right? Financial ones. But that was the idea, right? Like somebody launches a DFI app, there's like $100 million worth of kind of money coming in because people are exploring what are the other apps they can use. But they're the same platform, they know the guarantees, they don't need to be double checking who built this app because they know a lot of the guarantees already. The example I use is there's no chance anybody would build a $50 billion kind of financial system on something that's built and maintained by a dozen people, by a dozen engineers.
02:18:16.792 - 02:19:01.930, Speaker F: But this is what ethereum right now is. And so conceptually, that kind of ability to build on something on top, something super valuable, billion dollar value with few people as well. Like uniswap is built by a few people on top of something that's on its own is also like a startup and built by a few people is kind of almost unimaginable. Before blockchain, before open web. So like I mentioned this idea of compatibility. That's why I didn't give you examples of apps because there's just so many of them that you can do. And I have some in my chart but there's just infinite amount of things.
02:19:01.930 - 02:20:13.536, Speaker F: I was trying to find some examples that are kind of funny. You can do a social network where only people who have enough reputation can talk to each other, right? Or you can have Uber for coworkers because you have social network. You can have gig protocol for calling cars. So you can only call dober force coworkers when you work or whatever. You can have more interesting, more real example is you can have this personal medical data encrypted and then you share it to specific entities and you can have a log of everyone who has access to it, right? And all of this potentially is doable in the real world. But here you have already all this if we have all those protocols, this becomes an extremely easy thing to do, right? Or you can have both axio Infinity is doing right now, but there's a lot more opportunity to do with games that actually have economy around ownership around kind of creation and destruction and really kind of moving beyond just the easy pay to play. So I'm just going to give you one example of how this works already.
02:20:13.536 - 02:21:05.040, Speaker F: So we have one app on near, called Near Crowd which is pretty much an Amazon mechanical Torque which is a crowdsourcing app. And so this is done fully on chain. We have about 1500 daily actives on it with over 2000 uniques using it and it's already collected over a million data samples since launching in April, right? So this is an example of an app that kind of is literally what I use this kind of stuff at Google. Every single company doing machine learning is using this to collect data. And so this is like an example of this app working and the benefit is that it pays. People around the world. And we have people actually from Philippines who literally surviving right now because they have this job.
02:21:05.040 - 02:22:00.800, Speaker F: And during COVID there's no other opportunity for them to work in Philippines. We also have people in Russia who are leaving their shitty job, like on a factory or something because they are able to earn a good wage with this application. So, this is really example of like this open Web is not just conceptual. We have already stuff working and these people are non crypto people. This is not people who are doing D Five trading or any of the stuff. This is truly people who are just earning very little and want to find an opportunity in their life and creating these opportunities for them, creating this economy, and then them being able to participate in it in really easy way, like sign up, not need to figure out private keys, all the stuff and start using it. So, I don't know how many of you know about near protocol.
02:22:00.800 - 02:23:08.260, Speaker F: I didn't want to talk too much about it. If you're interested, reach me or near. There's a lot of information, but just high level, right? What we've been building and kind of our driver is really to build something that's ready for mass adoption, right? And so we kind of build this in a way that normal people can use it, normal people can onboard start using it. As I mentioned, in case of new crowd and being able to it's not going to cost them fortune or anything. It's scalable via Sharding, which means we actually maintain low cost because we actually are able to add capacity to the network. We've been really focused on making an experience as close to kind of what normal web experience is, right? We think of it as almost like firebase, right? And so pretty much allowing people to write in TypeScript in Rust, allowing people to kind of use existing smart contracts with Rest API so they can easily add it to whatever app stuff. Like this is really what drives us, like making it so easy that millions of developers actually able to participate.
02:23:08.260 - 02:24:06.044, Speaker F: And at the end, it is about community, right? I mentioned community multiple times. At the end, this whole thing is still people who are actually building and who are using. And so we have this huge community of kind of creators and people who are helping and of course developers who are kind of working together to really expand this ecosystem to make things kind of easier for everyone in the world. So, given you're here, you're hacking, you might be interested. We actually have It's protocol agnostic called Open Web Collective Accelerator and kind of founder community to help people to develop their applications into real products, into real things, help them with fundraise, help them with mentors, help them with tokenomics, all those things. And the application process is open right now. So if you're interested, opencollective.com,
02:24:06.044 - 02:24:48.090, Speaker F: apply there just to mention we have a lot of content that we believe in education, we believe in the space, needs a lot more kind of information and teaching and so we've been doing a lot. This is just few examples of Vidan. We have also Academy, we have certification program, all kinds of stuff. But check out our YouTube, there's a lot of videos on how contracts built, how protocols work, how use cases can be. If you're interested in more about kind of randomness or bridges or economics in general, our blog as well is full of that and thank you. And yeah, I'm excited to respond to your questions.
02:24:50.620 - 02:25:14.784, Speaker C: Thank you for such an excellent presentation. Really glad to have you in today. I wanted to ask you just a few questions about the direction of near and the developments in the future. I know you're just hitting your three year mark now. What the big part of the next half of the year will look like for you in terms of development? For sure.
02:25:14.822 - 02:25:46.840, Speaker F: Yeah. So I mean, near as ecosystem has lots of levels and this probably is a great example where it's like well in this level we have a set of things that's happening in this level overall. If we're talking about specifically the protocol, right. The blockchain part, we continue working on the sharding design. There is a lot of interesting things coming out. It's kind of resharding, changing number of shards and things like that. We're also working on really kind of optimizing things.
02:25:46.840 - 02:26:21.348, Speaker F: Like initially we did a lot of stuff just to kind of launch it, but there's a lot of ways we can optimize and make the kind of protocol even cheaper and faster to run. Right. And that's obviously going to be a goal going forward on kind of next level. We have a lot of interesting stuff coming out. One of the cool things that just came out kind of a few months ago have been Aurora. And Aurora is a separate company. It's a separate project that is providing people who want to write in solidity for kind of EVM ability to do it on near.
02:26:21.348 - 02:27:16.376, Speaker F: So it's actually infrastructurally it's actually we took EVM and they compiled it to WebAssembly and run it as a smart contract. This shows you how powerful kind of our native environment is, but this allows all the developers who want to target EVM able to build that and kind of enjoy all the same benefits that they're getting from near. We have bridge that connects to Ethereum. There's kind of few other bridges that are in progress that coming out. There's a lot of kind of NFT things that are growing. I'm not sure even I know all the projects that are building on near anymore in that space and there's also a huge set of DeFi as well that coming out and I'm pretty excited as it actually starts to kind of boost the economy of near through a lot of the DeFi tools. So I think that's kind of the basic things.
02:27:16.376 - 02:27:36.510, Speaker F: That probably half a year and kind of discovers a lot of this chart already and then over time, I'll be excited about these protocols that I mentioned. I don't think the few I know that have been worked on, but I would love to see kind of all of the ones I mentioned to actually be in progress in a year or so.
02:27:37.360 - 02:27:59.940, Speaker C: That makes sense. That makes sense for our newcomers to the hack. I know you put a list up of some projects that you'd like to be seen worked on for the specific new to Ethereum or maybe new to near Hackers. Do you think those are accomplishable or are there actionable ones that you could announce today that might be more efficient for the newcomers?
02:28:01.160 - 02:28:33.490, Speaker F: So I think you can get to an MVP in a hackathon. It's not going to be like the whole thing. You're not going to be probably launching it right away. But you can get something interesting that if you willing to continue and stick with it, you can build a company and fundraise and do all the kind of actual growing it into a real protocol over time. Each one of these is like a full project, pretty much of the level of some of the projects that are here. Right.
02:28:34.260 - 02:28:53.450, Speaker C: I think that's what's incredible is you could really drill down on any one of these, spend a lifetime doing it. I don't think some of our hackers understand the sort of magnitude of the ecosystem that we're involved in. It's interesting to see everyone from across the world focusing on the same ideas at the same time. I think progress is inherent with that.
02:28:53.820 - 02:29:16.828, Speaker F: Well, that's why I was drawing this graph because if you look at it, this is DeFi. And sure, it's cool like these things, but there's a lot of other stuff going on here and it's all interlated too. Like DeFi is powering a lot of the other components. So you kind of need to have both to kind of really come together.
02:29:16.994 - 02:29:26.850, Speaker C: What do you think is not getting enough attention right now? I know we've sort of talked about the parts that are and what's most interesting, but what do you think are the stones that are.
02:29:28.660 - 02:30:17.890, Speaker F: Mean? I think the least thing is where you really need to hit kind of the people side of things. Like conflict resolution is where I know, I think Keras been working on that, but an Argon a little bit. But in general it's a very messy problem. Right. Like two entities are not agreeing and stuff and so people are kind of naturally avoiding it, especially when you can write 1000 lines and build something that's really valuable. So I think that's where the space of things that are not really being looked at is space of where you really need to kind of start interacting with people and communities and really figure out how to solve some of these harder problems.
02:30:18.980 - 02:30:46.190, Speaker C: Right on. Well, I want to thank you again for taking the time to walk us through all of that today. This has been incredibly insightful. Next up, we have fast tackle here in the chat a presentation on NFTs using IPFS. I'll let them give the introduction that I cannot more than welcome to start your presentation when you're ready.
02:30:48.640 - 02:30:53.790, Speaker H: Great meeting you, Luke. Thanks a lot. Do you mind if I share screen?
02:30:54.240 - 02:30:55.950, Speaker C: Go for it, go for it.
02:30:57.440 - 02:31:03.728, Speaker H: So it's telling me here you cannot start screen share while the other participant is sharing. Oh, here we go.
02:31:03.814 - 02:31:04.850, Speaker C: There we go.
02:31:08.020 - 02:31:25.800, Speaker H: Great. Yeah. So. Thanks, Luca. Great meeting you. So we launched a protocol on Wednesday called K Spec. So this presentation has come together pretty quickly, sort of hacked it together overnight.
02:31:25.800 - 02:32:42.690, Speaker H: But before we jump in, I'll just give a very quick background on myself and the collective that I'm contributing to since March. Well, from the very beginning, I've been contributing to this collective called Canon, which is a group of senior museum curators and conservators who are operating pseudonymously. So they all sort of work at the top art institutions of the world. And then a few of us are also technologists and with backgrounds in crypto, Djens, basically sort of react engineers and solidity engineers. Myself, personally, I'm not an engineer, but I've spent a lot of time sort of developing software products, semi proficient in node, but also a very avid NFT collector since about December. So very briefly, I topped the charts in super rare until the actual real whales started moving in. Around January was when it really started taking off.
02:32:42.690 - 02:33:30.560, Speaker H: But the protocol that we've developed really came out of the issues that I was seeing in my own collecting. So when I started collecting, I found myself developing very close and fun relationships with a whole bunch of NFT artists. And we were running up into a lot of constraints and satisfactions with the way that these NFTs are structured. So Kspec is, first of all, it's open source, it's permissionless. It's completely on chain. And what it does is it gives artists unconstrained freedom to create. So we'll go into some of the constraints, the most common constraints that they end up encountering.
02:33:30.560 - 02:34:27.276, Speaker H: And then for collectors, for people like myself also, these things I made the mistake very early on of peeking under the hood, and there's some real serious issues there in terms of how long these things will actually last. And also, provenance is very brittle, which we'll get into. And then for NFTs, the protocol gives them adaptability and updatability. So normally, NFTs, as many of you might be aware, they're immutable both at the token level and also at the contract level. And so the protocol gives the artwork that these artists are creating updatability and adaptability. So the protocol actually works with any NFT. So this is super important to me because I spent an irresponsible amount of ETH on NFTs.
02:34:27.276 - 02:35:17.132, Speaker H: So this protocol works with any NFT, even if they've already been minted. And there's no need to stake or burn or otherwise encumber your NFT. It's non invasive. So, as I said, we launched on Wednesday, and I thought when we were putting this together, I had an inkling that this might be big. And I'm getting more and more conviction that actually this is a game changer for NFTs. So diving into what the actual problem was that we were looking to solve, a lot of you might be familiar with this, but I'll just go through it just to make sure that everybody's aware as to how these things work at the low level. So typically, an NFT is a smart contract.
02:35:17.132 - 02:36:18.176, Speaker H: And there are thousands of these that have been deployed, and each one of them so say that the structure of an ERC 721, which is the most common standard, is effectively you can think of it as like a table with rows, and each row is a token. And tokens have a token Uri property that then returns a single link. Or you can also pass like, bytes, or the token Uri can respond with a package of bytes. But effectively it's just like a static response, string response that is returned by the contract. And then it also tracks an address that controls the ownership of each token. So that's at the contract level. And practically the way that platforms implement the contracts is if you're an artist and you want to create an NFT, put a file.
02:36:18.176 - 02:36:56.076, Speaker H: Best practice, obviously save it on IPFS sometimes. Or you can return bytes directly because obviously that's on chain. But for practical purposes, the platforms restrict what you can upload. This is Rarible. So it's 100 megabytes, super rare, or restricted to 50 megabytes. And crucially, it's generally just one file that you can upload. So basically, an NFT at the moment, if you're trying to create an NFT, and if you're trying to create art, you have to squeeze everything into a single 50 to 100 megabyte file.
02:36:56.076 - 02:38:22.072, Speaker H: So when you're trying to do that, that really chokes creativity. And one thing that for me, because I'm not from an art background, the very first NFT that I collected was the very first piece of art that I collected. That was in December 2020. And what took me a bit of time to realize and then obviously then working very closely with these museum conservatives, is that digital art has been around for decades, right? And artists have not been facing they don't face constraints when they're creating. So for them, it's really torturous to have these wonderful creations and then having to try to jam it into a single megabyte file. So that ends up being that, for instance, like this anima music video. Normally the artist is working in ProRes or four K, and those files are, this file is actually 4GB and so how are you going to squeeze that into 50 megabytes? Well, you're facing the choice about either really degrading the art, degrading the resolution, or clipping the length, or both, which is just awful, right? So you can serve the file offline, but then it's not connected to the NFT.
02:38:22.072 - 02:39:47.780, Speaker H: So that's probably the most common limitation that I encountered in my own collecting and also that I hear artists most frustrated by. But then in the real world, art is actually often more complex than just a single file. So for instance, this is an art piece by an artist called Rachel Rose, which is actually a multi part installation. So how do you represent something that's got multiple parts in an NFT that's very challenging and then with an area that's particularly of interest to me, given I really love these, you know, so like 3D Avatars is, you know, these it's basically the, the three moment is in a very nascent stage. So the ecosystem is evolving very rapidly and the formats change. And as an artist, it's very risky, right, to commit to any particular format because right now sort of GLBs gltfs are the formats, but even those have all sorts of variations that change over time. So if you have to commit to a file up front and then you can't update it, you're not going to stick it into the NFT.
02:39:47.780 - 02:40:51.980, Speaker H: So some of the solutions that you're seeing are off chain. Like in meevis, for instance, this is just coming off their own server, so there are some hacks around it. But you can see here, to me, at least when I see this, this is through Ten Berners Lee NFT. So sometimes solutions that people come to is like try to jam everything into the description field of an NFT. But even this you can't change subsequently. So the solution that we came to, by the way, this is a problem that's very well understood and there are some solutions, a lot of the solutions that we've seen are sort of hacks, right? Like this one where you try to jam everything into a description, the other one is like trying to attack the problem at the smart contract level. But the problem is that then obviously everything that's been created before, you're not going to be able to take advantage of that.
02:40:51.980 - 02:41:48.252, Speaker H: So say my NFTs do not benefit from somebody launching a new smart contract. But also these smart contracts are difficult to untangle, difficult to understand. And if you've got like three, four competing alternatives and you're an artist and it took me 2 hours, right, to disentangle how the smart contract for Timperlessly, how that contract worked, and then if you're on super rare, if you use another contract, then you're migrating away from that platform, you get pretty messy. Pretty quickly they start trying to solve this at the smart contract level. So for us, the solution came from two insights. One of them is philosophical and one of them is technical. So from a philosophical perspective, the insight is that the NFT is not actually the artwork.
02:41:48.252 - 02:43:28.124, Speaker H: So all the NFT is it's a certificate of ownership that gets passed back and forth and there's no point trying to jam your artwork unless your artwork is just simple, just like a GIF or an image or a single low resolution video, then it might work. But if it's anything more complex than that, and as I said, the vast majority of the art outside of NST is generally much more complex, then you're just going to end up massacring your art to try to squeeze it into that. So just treat it as a certificate and then develop the art in a fully expressive parallel state. And that is where the artist has complete freedom to decide what to decide and to describe and to secure what the art is and have that parallel state being inextricably tied to the NFT. So that's all very well said and that's all very well, but how do you actually pull that off? So that's where the technical insight came in, where all NFTs, so all NFT contracts, ERC, 721s, ERC, 1155s, they have a function called self transfer sorry, self transfer, sorry, safe transfer from. And the parameters for that function are a from address, a to address and a token ID. So those are the three ones that normally get used.
02:43:28.124 - 02:44:23.468, Speaker H: And then there's a fourth parameter in there called the data parameter. And sorry, I should have screenshot it here, but I didn't put it in here. But that fourth parameter is the key to unlocking this parallel state because in that fourth parameter, that data parameter, you can pass it any arbitrary string sorry, it has to be invites, but you can pass it any arbitrary data. And that's what we use to construct this parallel state. So we pass a carefully constructed data package where we then describe on chain what the artwork is. So what you're looking at here is an actual live example of an artwork by an artist called Yenasutala. So we created the token and then in the parallel state, we created a data package, which I'll show you shortly because it actually relies very heavily on IPFS.
02:44:23.468 - 02:45:40.650, Speaker H: We pass a data package where we describe the artwork and it includes a 1.8 gigabyte ProRes version of the artwork which doesn't fit into the super NFT. And then we define a valid case pick transaction as a transaction where Jenna sends the NFT to herself and so that records the dotted package on chain and then she sent us the NFT. Then imagine in six months time, yena comes up with a cool idea about adding like a 360 version video. So like a VR version of the video, what we would do is we would send the token back to Yena and obviously there are noncustodial ways of doing this but at the moment we're just manually doing it right where we send the NFT back to Yena and then she burns an updated data package. So again, this is all on chain and that will add the additional asset to the NFT. She does self transfer to record that and then she sends it back to us.
02:45:40.650 - 02:46:45.516, Speaker H: So if this were, for instance, like a 3D avatar and some new platform had emerged or file formats had moved on, then as an artist you're not too stressed about that because you can always update the parallel state and it's also much more expressive. You can express whatever you want in that state. So I'll go through a quick demo. As I said, we launched on Wednesday and we've got a quick demo application. So Anima and Marigold, they actually created this music video. So this is the first full resolution, full length NFT of a music video that we used K spec for. And what I'll link to now is our demo application which is we've called IDDQD and you can pass it any NFT smart, so any 721 or 1155 smart contract and a token ID.
02:46:45.516 - 02:47:21.684, Speaker H: And it's going to read directly off chain whether it finds any valid case spec data package. So in this case it found one. And you can see here that we've defined a case spec as having three components. This just described what kind of case spec it is and this is a header. And then the body is where we actually store the metadata and the actual data. So there's one area that I'll just quickly take you to, which is the credits because this in and of itself is a know. I personally find this super excited.
02:47:21.684 - 02:48:03.456, Speaker H: So what you're seeing here, this is anima's address and this is Marigold's address. So immediately here we can see that they're both signing this. And actually in the header, I won't go into the details. In the header you can actually see a hash confirmation, signature confirmation from Marigold, who's the co author. So here you already have a system for multiple people attesting to the providence of this. And if you follow that transaction actually here in our application, if you type the path parameter ID at the end, it'll actually take you to who made this NFT. And again, all of this is on chain.
02:48:03.456 - 02:48:46.784, Speaker H: And here let me inspect the second result, which is Marigold and we'll go all the way to her records. I mean there's metadata on her identity which I won't go into, but you can explore I'll link this in the chat if you guys want to explore that, everything that's in there. But just very quickly I'll show you. Again, this is all on chain. Here in the storage. What we have is data replication. So we've got fallbacks, so we've got a centralized URL which will facilitate fast sharing but also decentralized alternatives.
02:48:46.784 - 02:49:20.720, Speaker H: As I said, it relies heavily on IPFS Rweave. We use as well. But anything bigger than a gigabyte really is not practical to use Rweave. So just click here just to quickly show what that looks like. So this is Marigold reading her ID. So the beauty of this as a collector is I don't have to rely on say, Sotheby's or even super. I trust them to verify this, but I can now verify this for myself on chain.
02:49:20.720 - 02:50:32.996, Speaker H: And even more importantly, machines can pull this information without having to send an email to sotheby's and going like, hey, how did you verify that this thing is actually made by the person who made it, who says they made it? And also it allows people to use platforms like say like Zora or OpenSea to create these things and have like an inbuilt provenance chain. So basically there's no reason there for there to be fake NFTs now basically, which is one of the big problems in these permissionless environments, actually, I think I've covered the storage component right. But yeah, as I said, you can go through and inspect this. There's a lot packed in there. Let me see if there's anything quickly. One thing that's interesting here is that we've defined like a distribution element so that pulls things from storage as required. So again, if there's some new application that emerges that requires a particular format for the NFT to be ingested, you can just define a new element here that serves that particular application.
02:50:32.996 - 02:51:19.904, Speaker H: It could be like decentraland or spatial or something like that. Every NFT you can define like an arbitrary number of records and you can also define an arbitrary number of components to the artwork. So I'll leave it there. But if there are questions as to this actual structure, we can cover that. Here it is. Okay, so as I said, we launched on Wednesday. So what's next for us is to at the moment, we're implementing these manually in collaboration with platforms and selected platforms and selected artists.
02:51:19.904 - 02:52:22.330, Speaker H: But we want to put this in everybody's hands. So first step is developing docs. We then need to create a graphical user interface to sort of broaden the number of people that can actually use this. We need to build applications. So for example, what this enables is like cross platform staff aggregators and sort of attribution as well, which is a big problem right now where if you're a Minter and you have collaborator, the Minter is going to get the stats for the sale, which has a big impact on artist earning capability. So those are the things building applications and we've got a fantastic a team of engineers working with us, but we're looking for help as well to help build out this protocol because we're going to need a lot of hands. We're already seeing a ton of demand and we've been warned by some platforms that to get ready to scale up because we're seeing a lot of demand from the artists and the collector side.
02:52:22.330 - 02:52:28.030, Speaker H: So yeah, I'll pause there and yeah. Luke, thanks a lot for the opportunity.
02:52:29.840 - 02:52:55.110, Speaker C: Of course, we're happy to have you. We're excited for the launch and sort of following up on that. I know you mentioned there's been a positive reception so far, but how have things been going? I mean, you just launched, I guess, for some of the hackers here who are interested. What could you use specific help with or potentially what could they use this tech for in their projects going forward for the next three weeks?
02:52:56.440 - 02:54:10.590, Speaker H: Yeah, so we're trying to work that out ourselves. I think any application that sort of helps someone create this data package, like, imagine an artist, right, that doesn't know how to handle JSON, doesn't have like hashdeep or whatever installed on their command line. An application that would construct this, validate the schema for it. That would be something super interesting and that artists would find. Because what we're seeing right now is we've got a ton of artists who are DMing us with the stuff that they haven't been able to create because they were facing the limitations that they did in NFTs and they're saying, how do I create a case back? And the best I can tell them is, okay, we're going to get you docs soon. Pretty soon. So anything that can help them create this thing for themselves, I can basically give you like a list of ten people who would be ready tomorrow to start implementing it.
02:54:11.360 - 02:54:30.870, Speaker C: That's excellent. Yeah. There's been so much expansion in the NFT space, specifically over the past year. I think everyone, like the question on everyone's tongue is sort of like, what will be next? Where I guess do you expect things to be maybe next year? In a perfect world?
02:54:32.360 - 02:55:32.570, Speaker H: Yeah, well, in a perfect world, everybody all artists. We can even handle anonymous identities as well. We've got like an attestation system that we can use with this. So I think all artists have verified their identity on chain, and then for anything more complex than a video or a GIF, then creating this structure for those NFTs on chain and then that just opens up a whole ton of possibility. You could use this for journals, for instance. I'd love to see this being implemented for academic journals. Right.
02:55:32.570 - 02:56:12.470, Speaker H: And VR AR, let me put it this way. I would love to see the complexity of the art just explode and to be surprised in a year from now going like, holy crap. We thought that 3d avatars were cool and we thought that in a year's time everybody would be like have their 3d avatars in an NFT, which we're working on by the way. But being there in twelve months ago like yeah, we did that. But this other thing that we just never saw coming, that would be pretty cool.
02:56:13.320 - 02:56:25.930, Speaker C: Yeah. There's just a myriad of possibilities. A sort of super nuanced question for you here. If you could explain for us in the call right now how the parallel state works.
02:56:27.660 - 02:57:13.920, Speaker H: How the parallel state works? Yeah. By parallel state, we basically mean a state for the artwork right at the moment here. So this is a token, right? So token two 60 90 on super rare. So that's a real token. And this all exists right now. And the state of the artwork at this point includes a 50 megabyte file, which is a low res file used for serving on the Internet. And it includes a pro res, almost two gigabyte file.
02:57:13.920 - 02:57:52.180, Speaker H: So you can think of it as Ethereum is a state machine. Right. So at any particular point in time, it's like a snapshot of what the data is. So that's what we mean by parallel states at this point. This is the state of the artwork. Then if you want to modify that casepec has permissioning built at the lowest level so that, for instance, I can't just modify this myself. So the way we enforce that is by defining a valid case spec as one where the artist has to send the artwork to herself.
02:57:52.180 - 02:58:20.936, Speaker H: If K 21 sent this to themselves, it just would be ignored by the protocol. But because here she sent it to herself, we know that both K 21, which is our collection, and the artist consented to this updating of the artwork. So here, this was the state before and this is the state now. The new state includes an additional file. So I don't know if that answers.
02:58:20.968 - 02:58:53.370, Speaker C: The no, that makes sense. I appreciate the definition being pretty synonymous with the syntax chosen. As far as next steps for you guys, I know you've sort of mentioned what your plans post rollout are. Maybe delving back into that a little bit for case spec. You've got the applications you're hoping to build, and if you could just, I think, go a little bit further into that for people who are still with us. I'd be pretty interested to see what you're working on.
02:58:53.980 - 02:59:43.812, Speaker H: Yeah, sure. You can always take you step by step as to where we're going. I think first we're going to start with an application that allows people to create their case spec IDs. Because those data packages are very standardized. That's a good place to start. And also, it also helps artists prepare for when they have a product because you require a case spec ID to create a valid case. We've got a product designer, right? And so, again, we launched this on Wednesday, so we haven't really exactly defined how that looks like, but our product designer is fantastic, and we'll come up with a great UX for creating that UI.
02:59:43.812 - 03:00:03.710, Speaker H: Then I think the next step would be creating UI that tackles the 90% use case, which is that artists run into this like 50 megabyte, 100 megabyte limit. And what they actually want to do is they want people to experience.
03:00:05.440 - 03:00:05.756, Speaker A: A.
03:00:05.778 - 03:00:45.304, Speaker H: Three gigabyte file on an LCD screen, whether it's at a gallery or in the collector's. Yeah. So there we're talking about actually constructing a graphical interface for constructing a standardized case. I always I think there's always going to be room for someone like Canon, but it doesn't have to be just us, but someone like Canon creating these more bespoke ones. Like, we did one, for instance, for a website that the artwork is actually like an entire self contained website. So that takes a bit more thought. And those are going to be a bit harder to handle in a standardized way.
03:00:45.304 - 03:02:05.220, Speaker H: But 90% of the artwork is at the moment anyway, right? 90% of artists will be able to use this graphical interface and get their artwork done. And it also might serve as like a reference implementation for any platform that wants to just sort of build that in into their own applications. And we also are quite interested in this idea of matching collectors and artists and then sort of like developing a noncustodial way, because at the moment, as I mentioned, the permissioning system requires you to send the token to the artist. I'm not particularly concerned about the security of that because most of the time, the likelihood that a legitimate artist is going to run away with their own token, right, that'd be disastrous for them. But still, obviously for completeness, it'd be good to have like a noncustodial solution. But more than that, to be able to do it asynchronously I think is important, and hence why I think if you've got that capability for the noncustodial, where someone could deposit the token and then have that performed at some point.
03:02:05.290 - 03:02:06.070, Speaker A: And then.
03:02:08.280 - 03:03:04.488, Speaker H: That would be super useful. And then, as I mentioned, these applications that read sales, so sales statistics in particular. And this is something that artists have actually shared with us. Right? It's very difficult right now because each platform has their own way of tracking sales statistics, even though everything's on chain or should be on chain, but also things like, say in this Anima video, this is a collaboration between Anima, who's, the music artist, and Marigold Who. She's the visual artist or the 3D animator. And Anima minted the work on Super Rare, and he received the credit for whatever it was like 21 ETH or something like that. And Marigold did not like on the platform.
03:03:04.488 - 03:03:43.430, Speaker H: She did not. There's no way for Super Rare at the moment right. To make that attribution because the credit is provided, like in the description, it's not machine readable, but with K Spec, it's completely machine readable because it's very well structured and defined and it's cross platform. That's one application we're very interested in because it directly helps artists to have somewhere where they can show the track record of the sales and everything, which is super critical to what they can expect to get for subsequent works.
03:03:44.440 - 03:04:09.004, Speaker C: I love it. I can immediately see the value for the creators going forward, especially in this sort of decentralized economy, that's going to be incredibly important. I want to thank you for presenting today and showing us everything that you've been working on. I'm really excited for your team and really, I guess we can also we're proud of the developments being made on your side. So thank you. Thank you again for all of your time today.
03:04:09.202 - 03:04:12.108, Speaker H: Appreciate it. Thank you very much, Luke. Thanks, everyone.
03:04:12.274 - 03:04:32.870, Speaker C: Of course, our next presentation let me share my screen real quick. Our next presentation is going to be recorded. We have stefano of LongHash ventures coming in. We'll be sharing a video and audio for him and kicking that off right now.
03:04:51.950 - 03:04:52.698, Speaker F: Hi, everyone.
03:04:52.784 - 03:05:10.222, Speaker I: This is Stefanberry from LongHash Ventures. Very excited to be with you today at Hackfs. A big thank you to Stefan and the whole team at Protocol Labs for inviting us to share with you all of the participants in Hackfs about the LongHash X accelerator.
03:05:10.286 - 03:05:13.106, Speaker C: And of course, to our program, which.
03:05:13.128 - 03:05:52.910, Speaker I: Is kicking off in a few months time. So maybe to start off a little bit about LongHash X. So we are Asia's leading web free accelerator. We're part of LongHash Ventures, which is a crypto investment fund and accelerator based in Singapore, and for Long Hash X. So we have graduated six cohorts in the last three and a half years. We have over 40 alumni projects, and we have helped these projects raise over $100 million in funding. And some of our notable alumni from the program include Zapper, Instadap, Balancer, and Akala.
03:05:52.910 - 03:07:10.982, Speaker I: Now, in addition to $80,000 in seed funding, if you join the accelerator program, your growth is going to be boosted by the network. So we have over 1000 investors in our network and of course, quite a number of notable and high profile mentors and also by education through our modules. So we have six web, three focused modules that include product strategy and design, tokenomics governance, technical mentorship, community building and marketing, and of course, fundraising. Now, some of the investors that connected with our projects after our most recent demo Day, which is back in April, include some of the names you see here. So both crypto native investors like Iosg or Gumi cryptos, and then some other non crypto, but of course, notable investors such as Sequoia. Now the program is segmented into two tracks, so we have a DeFi track and a filecoin track. Now, I think today most of the interest would be around the Filecoin Frontier Accelerator track.
03:07:10.982 - 03:07:45.618, Speaker I: This one we run in partnership with Protocol Labs. And what this means for you is that, of course, you get a lot of technical mentorship as you're building on filecoin, and you get access to mentor sessions, workshops, and fireside chats with some of the members of the Protocol Labs team. Yeah, so I talked a little bit earlier about our module. So as you can see, it's very crypto native and so typically through the Accelerator Program it's twelve weeks during which we touch on each of one of.
03:07:45.624 - 03:07:46.850, Speaker F: These modules with you.
03:07:47.000 - 03:09:07.098, Speaker I: This includes going through workshops, fireside, chats, and then of course one on one sessions with Mentors and also with the Long Hash team. Now you do receive Mentorship both from the team and from top crypto native Mentors. And on a on a regular basis you'll have interactions with me as a program lead as well as with Pranav who's our venture builder. But then also you get access to our network, of course from our friends at Protocol Labs like Colin, like ZX, and then also members in our investor network like Tekken from Polychain and Bobby from CMS Holdings. Now, we just wanted to also illustrate a little bit on how we work with. So to do this, we wanted to share an example of the work we did with Balancer, which was a project that I'm sure many of you have heard of and who went through one of our most recent cohorts. So with Balancer, some of the things we did included shaping the decentralized governance model, and we did that by hosting a roundtable with founders of Aave Synthetix and Defiance Capital who shared their experience and ideas on decentralization.
03:09:07.098 - 03:09:59.834, Speaker I: We also wrote a governance proposal on staking of one of their pool tokens. Sorry, as a precursor to a sort of wider adoption of decentralized governance, we also helped them to develop case studies on why LPs should provide liquidity into their pools. And lastly, we also post program. We got a grant from them to help develop their community in Asia Pacific. So this is just an example of the different ways that we actually work with USA projects through the Accelerator Program. Okay, so we're currently recruiting for our next cohort. So applications are open and we'll have a QR code with a link to the description just in a minute, but just to share a little bit about the timeline.
03:09:59.834 - 03:11:08.734, Speaker I: So, applications are open until next Monday, which is in about three days from now. And after the applications close on the 9 August, there'll be two rounds of interviews and selection. Then by the 10 September, projects will be selected and we'll make the announcement directly to you via email. And then the Accelerator Program begins a month from that. So in the 11 October it runs for twelve weeks and then at the end of it we'll have Demo Day that is scheduled for the 18 January when you get a chance to pitch your project to thousands of investors. And after the Demo Day we still worked with you and with the investors to make one on one introductions. Now you may also be wondering how do we evaluate projects that are selected into the Accelerator Program? So as a base criteria, we of course look to make sure that you have a Web Three native or crypto native business model and that you're actually tapping into networks of public permissionless blockchains.
03:11:08.734 - 03:11:15.640, Speaker I: And then we have both a top down and bottom up approach to do the detailed selection. So from a top down.
03:11:17.930 - 03:11:18.534, Speaker B: We look.
03:11:18.572 - 03:12:39.730, Speaker I: To see where do you fit on the Web Three ecosystem and are you plugging in some of the gaps that we currently see in the Web Three landscape and or are you tapping into some of these upcoming trends that we're also seeing? And then from a bottom up perspective, we look at a number of things. So one is we look at your business model. So how are you planning to capture value if you already have your tokenomics formulated or you have a rough idea? We also look at this is there a fair allocation to the community? What's the inflation mechanism, et cetera? Of course, we look at the team, what's the team's background, what is your domain and crypto expertise, your technical ability, and of course your history of executing and building startups. And then lastly, we also look at what's your starting position. So what kind of traction do you have? Have you done any fundraising and who has been funding you? Do you have a community and how active is it? Do you have partnerships? Who are your competitors and how are you differentiating from them? So hopefully this gives you a little bit of the idea on how we evaluate projects that get selected into the program. So thank you again for your time. Very happy to have been asked to share a little bit about the Loghash program.
03:12:39.730 - 03:13:10.540, Speaker I: Now, very importantly, we would love to encourage everybody to apply. So if you scan this QR code with your phones, this will lead you directly to our application form. And as I said earlier, applications close in a few days on the 9 August and we'll start to evaluate immediately after that. And so for those of you that apply, we'll be reaching out to you pretty soon. Thank you so much and have a great day.
03:13:15.380 - 03:14:06.204, Speaker C: Really exciting presentation from LongHash. I want to take this moment to remind people to continue the conversation in Discord. We have a vibrant community there with both the industry leaders that we've invited for every one of our competitions as well as a lot of hackers. If you are new to hacking with ETH Global, our Discord is a one stop shop for networking with like minded peers, learning about projects that you could become part know. I e Long Ash Ventures as well know, finding people to build your great ideas. What we do here know, build the community one developer at a time and we stand by that. So our resources, like the YouTube channel where we record all of the videos and the stuff that you'll see here today can be viewed after the competition ends.
03:14:06.204 - 03:15:10.864, Speaker C: Whether or not you want to continue on your project or not, all of that information will be stored there for future reference. And I think that we're no stranger to providing opportunities. And the discord is a great place to meet, communicate and grow. Our next talk, Share My Screen with Blake from Outlier Ventures, is going to be a recorded talk as well, and I think we are ready to get that underway shortly. Hello, Hackfest. My name is Blake Lazenski and I'm the program manager of the FalcoIn Basecamp program at Outlier Ventures. I'm very honored and humbled to be presenting in front of you today, and let me tell you why.
03:15:10.864 - 03:16:27.960, Speaker C: Protocol Labs teamed up with Outlier Ventures to bring you a dedicated version of our core web free Startup Acceleration program, Basecamp, dedicated to startups and projects that leverage IPFS, FalcoIn, Lip, P, two P, or any other part of Protocol Lab stack in their tech. And it's quite important because as Basecamp, we helped 70 companies raise over $140,000,000 in seed capital, and we've reached a combined total valuation of our portfolio at the level of $1 billion. At the peak of the bull market run, I believe it was closer to $3 billion because we're really not afraid of token investments. So what do you get if you apply to Base Camp? And why should you consider it as a way to ten X your startup? You get $50,000 upfront investment from us, as well as a chance for a follow on investment at 250K. You get help with all aspects of your business that I'm going to get into later, as well as access to our network of leading web free mentors as well as investors. So you can apply directly on our website, or you can book an office hours call with our team to discuss why we think FalcoIn Basecamp is the logical next step in the development of your project. All hackfs teams submission will be considered a priority.
03:16:27.960 - 03:17:47.964, Speaker C: So let me tell you more about BaseCap. It's a fully remote three months program that allowed us to condense eight years of organizational learning at Outlier Ventures. Everything from legal setup, jurisdiction, token design, distribution, governance, tech hiring, community and marketing anything you can imagine to make a web free startup widely successful. This particular program, the Falcon Base Camp, focuses on three key areas for Falcon technology financialization of the open data economy, anything regarding data commodification, DeFi apps, DeFi privacy layer, as well as using storage contracts and compute contracts to create a new class of financial instruments. The second theme is very close to our core thesis, the Metaverse OS, and it's all about NFT experience and metaverse persistence. It goes from large NFT assets like virtual worlds and 3D printing models to making the metaverse persistent and interoperable, for example, by helping track NFT data across virtual worlds. Last but not least is the Cloud 20 Decentralized Storage Compute theme that includes all of the use cases that are typically associated with FalcoIn retrieval, market storage, market client, and minor matching to cases like distributed AI.
03:17:47.964 - 03:18:36.524, Speaker C: As a service. So we provide this customized entrepreneurship support to web free startups. And you might have heard about some of our successful alumni such as Dia Data or Boson Protocol. I believe each of them is around 500 million market cap right now, depending on the market prices. So how do we do it? Well, it's all about what we call the free piece. It's about process, essentially goal setting, helping you track progress and move through key elements of your flywheel activities that bring the most value to your business and helping you reach operational excellence. It's about people, the people we have in the company that are leading world class experts in all of the areas of business that I mentioned before and give you one on one focused attention.
03:18:36.524 - 03:19:14.172, Speaker C: And finally, our mentors. We have an amazing network at Outlier Ventures, but you also get access to the network of protocol apps as well as successful funders that took their projects to fruition and know the challenges of FalcoIn and Protocol Lab stack. And finally, it's about partners. It's about exchanges. We partner up with startup communities, we work with other startups and alumni of Outlier Ventures, but most importantly, investors. I believe at Outlier Ventures, fundraising is our key strength. We have you pitching to investors early on and we hope to have you fully funded by the end of the program.
03:19:14.172 - 03:19:38.950, Speaker C: We have some heavy hitters interested in the Falcon basecamp. Specifically, from Sequoia Capital to Union Square Ventures. Venbushi Capital, Okx or Wabi Ventures. So do not wait. Apply today because it's only three days left till the application deadline. You can do it by going on the link you have on the slide or scanning the QR code. The process is on a rolling basis, so again, you get a bit of an advantage if you apply early.
03:19:38.950 - 03:20:17.772, Speaker C: The whole process is done fully remotely. Essentially you're speaking to us and clarify on your market and product. And then we loop in an Ov domain expert to focus on specific aspects of your business during the due diligence process. Feel free to book office hours with us or reach out to me on Twitter at blake beyond on LinkedIn at blake Lezenski. If you have any questions and without further delay, I invite you to apply. And happy hacking. Excellent.
03:20:17.772 - 03:20:56.820, Speaker C: Thank you Blake. Thank you to the entire team at Outlier. I want to welcome our final presentation, Michelle Lee. Michelle is a people centered software maker. Currently she leads the developer onboarding group at Protocol Labs and she's got an extensive history behind that. And I will give her a chance to introduce herself. She was a Code for America Fellow with the City of Philadelphia and then a co founder and CEO of Text design platform that helps cities connect with their residents through text and email workflows.
03:20:56.820 - 03:21:18.980, Speaker C: Previously she invented Google Forms, which I know we all use, designed online trust and safety tools for ebay, and studied human computer interaction at Stanford. Quite an interesting background. And she'll be with us in just a second. Michelle, I want to thank you again for joining us, adding to the intrigue of what we have today for the summit.
03:21:20.280 - 03:21:22.320, Speaker D: Hi, Luke. Thank you so much for having me.
03:21:22.410 - 03:21:23.210, Speaker C: Of course.
03:21:26.460 - 03:22:06.212, Speaker D: All right, well, I'm very delighted to come here and tell you about all the ways that I want to give you all money. So in a moment, I will be sharing my screen and talking through some of our grants programs at the File Point and IPFS projects. Here we go. All right, so welcome, everyone. Thanks for hanging in there through such a long and exciting day. And thank you very much to our organizers for putting together such a jampacked schedule. So I am calling from Philadelphia, which is on the east coast of the US.
03:22:06.212 - 03:22:31.384, Speaker D: It's a subtropical climate. It's hot and humid. It's 90 degrees Fahrenheit today. Trust me, I'm going somewhere with this. I spend a lot of time mountain biking, and we joke that our local trail system is the jungle and everything's alive in the jungle. And that's what building in Web Three feels like right now. There's just so much creative and unstoppable activity, a lot of different intertwined projects and movements.
03:22:31.384 - 03:23:13.636, Speaker D: It's really hard to untangle them. And you can see things like, hey, ferns are taking advantage of the shade of the bigger trees for their ideal climate. And you've got vines growing up these branches and taking over the trail in the background. It's getting narrower and narrower. And so this is a really exciting and inspiring place to be building, but we also don't want to take these conditions for granted. So plants need moisture, nutrients, shade, need a lot of things to grow, not just as individual plants, but an interconnected and mutually beneficial system. And so that's why we call our community and Growth group the Ecosystem Working Group at the File Point and IPFS projects.
03:23:13.636 - 03:24:19.804, Speaker D: And our mission is to enable developers and entrepreneurs like yourselves to execute on your dreams through advocacy, technical support, grants, collaborations as you iterate towards success and get ready to hit escape velocity, whatever that means for you. Whether that is, hey, that was a great learning project, now I'm going to put it on pause and try something else. Or hey, my open source project is sustainable because I've found these ways to have a really engaged and extensive volunteer network, or you reach profitability, or you go after accelerator programs and venture investment. So really, any model where we're bringing in people just getting started, building in Web Three, realizing the software or the technology projects of your dreams, and then using the collective community support to help you get to the next level. So today I want to specifically talk about some of the grants programs as an overview. Have three tracks of grants. Next step, microgrants.
03:24:19.804 - 03:25:21.350, Speaker D: We have open grants and we have targeted grants so I'll talk about the Microgrants first, the next step. Microgrants are a really straightforward program. It is offering $5,000 to take the next step on your project. So in the application, which I'll walk through shortly, all we're asking is, did you start something like, is there evidence on GitHub that you started building in this ecosystem? And do you have a credible plan to get to the next step and open source that work, so that's all Filecoin, IPFS or Lib PDP should be used in the project stack, but it can also be indirectly through frameworks like Textile or Pinata pinning services or really anything that builds on top of those. It's a very lightweight application with a weekly review. I will share these URLs again later, but I just want to walk through the process so you can see on the left side we have some accepted grant applications. This is all in the GitHub repos for you to check out the history to apply, you create a new issue.
03:25:21.350 - 03:26:10.630, Speaker D: There is a template with six questions. Some of those questions ask you for links to things in your GitHub repo or in the community forums. But basically it's a page and a half of information and we review these every single week. So trying to get back to you quickly, we've had grantees who needed these funds to pay an infrastructure or hosting bill. We've had grantees who've used these funds to hire great designers and UX writers so that their app would be more user friendly and more popular. We've had folks use this to fund their own time so that they could continue investing in the project. So there's no restriction on the funds other than it has to go directly towards your project.
03:26:10.630 - 03:27:03.732, Speaker D: And that's the Microgrants Program. After this, we come to open grants. So open grants range typically from $5000 to $50,000 for novel work to apply IPFS Filecoin or Lib PDP to new domains or to bring significant new usage. So really, any project that has promise of really extending these networks or these ecosystems or maybe integrate these technologies into your existing project, so it's still very open ended. There are a few dedicated tracks that are listed in the repository. We specifically have some collaborative grants with the Hadera Token service with chain link Oracles. More are coming in the next two weeks.
03:27:03.732 - 03:27:58.310, Speaker D: So a lot of collaborations across Web Three that we're interested in seeing people combine multiple projects into a single application. There are also some RFPs for specific areas of interest, but I believe more than three quarters of grants are awarded to completely new ideas. So we want to hear everything that you have to share. I would call it a middleweight application process. It's a little more than an issue, but it's a lot simpler than really most application processes, and we review these every month. So just to walk through some of the process, you create your own project idea that meaningfully advances the stack. You can also check out the RFPs for lists of ideas or areas of interest.
03:27:58.310 - 03:28:50.640, Speaker D: Then you submit a PR using the proposal templates. I believe it's about two pages of information to fill out. Really just looking for a strong proposal that includes evidence that you've thought through the problem, that you have the experience to deliver on it, and that you're breaking it down into realistic milestones. So that's the open grant shape or structure. We review these every month and so the longest you'll have to wait for a response is one month. And it used to be quarterly, but we wanted to move towards an even faster review cycle to give people the chance to hear back and make their plans and get on with building your project. Just a few of the past grantees.
03:28:50.640 - 03:29:28.044, Speaker D: Wish I had time to share all of them with you because there are some really cool projects. This was one of my favorite microgrants this year to a project called Ajam and it's a web application that hosts asynchronous jam sessions for musicians. So you can record little snippets of you playing one track. It publishes to IPFS and then you can also invite other users to contribute their tracks to your hot new record. Really, really cool use of IPFS. There another one much lower in the stack. This is for a project called Go Graph Split.
03:29:28.044 - 03:30:18.880, Speaker D: So if you're storing directly on filecoin and you're not using one of the many really awesome and easy to use storage helpers, if you're building directly on a core filecoin implementation, you need to split your data set into pieces smaller than either 32 or 64 gigs. And this is just a really simple and clean utility that can split your data into the right size data set. So, really nice little building block. It's not necessarily trying to solve every problem in the world, but it solves one particular problem really neatly. So we really like to see tools like this that can be used by a lot of different players. And then here's a very different project. This is a whole initiative, it's not just software, but it's also the program and system and working with a local regional governments to make this happen.
03:30:18.880 - 03:31:18.740, Speaker D: It's a geoweb project and it's a set of protocols and systems for tying digital property rights to physical land in parts of the world where there can be a lot of unclear land records. There are also grants, we also give grants to community builders. So sometimes it's not just software that you ship or an application that you publish, but we've had grantees propose hosting meetups someone who's fantastic at building communities, requests a bit of funding to host a small or large event. We've also awarded a grant recently to a team that was building an incubator program for storage providers. So coaching and developing small scale storage providers so that we could further decentralize the system and. Help even more new players get on board. So as you can see wide wide range of grantees.
03:31:18.740 - 03:31:53.360, Speaker D: I know that there are two of these are open grants and so that means the teams have probably had more experience working together. But we also really like to award micro grants. So don't hesitate to apply. All you need is just some evidence that you've started building in this realm. So it does not have to be a fully featured app before you apply. In fact, the whole point is to help you get there. So really want to encourage anyone who is interested in these ideas to consider applying for a grant.
03:31:53.360 - 03:32:45.424, Speaker D: Here are a few ways to reach us. I think that having raised venture capital before, I think the climate of those conversations can be a little adversarial and we aim to be the opposite of that. We really are here to support and encourage you with resources to help build new things on top of this Web Three stack. So one way to reach us is to create a draft PR with your submission or file an issue and label it work in progress. You are not penalized at all for these early submissions and we're happy to work with you to help shape it into something that's a strong application. You can also email us grants@filecoin.org or join in the filecoin project Slack, the Grant Questions Channel.
03:32:45.424 - 03:33:07.850, Speaker D: Happy to answer any questions that you have there. So that's about it from us. In addition to the Grants team, I also lead our developer advocacy group. So we have a lot of ways that we want to get to know what you're building, support you, encourage you and really build the future of Web Three together.
03:33:09.180 - 03:33:12.120, Speaker E: Thanks very much. Luke.
03:33:13.900 - 03:33:15.260, Speaker D: Is there a chat with questions.
03:33:15.330 - 03:33:16.510, Speaker E: That I can answer?
03:33:19.120 - 03:34:03.400, Speaker C: I think the best foot forward here would be to continue the conversation in discord. I know people are going to be having questions from all the presentations today and I want to thank you for your willingness to do that, if that's all right with you. I think they could also reach out to you given the contact information that you had just posted. We are expecting probably, I want to say close to 100 plus projects coming out of this event. I know I can speak for a lot of the hackers and that they will be quite interested in finding grants and other funding options following the event. So I want to thank you for your presentation and thank you for your time explaining that it's a great way to close out an event with a lot of enthusiasm for the builders.
03:34:04.140 - 03:34:14.990, Speaker D: Fantastic. Well, thanks for having me here. It's great to be here for the builders. I just want two words nondilutive. Thank you very much.
03:34:16.240 - 03:34:22.930, Speaker C: All right, we're going to be taking things offline from here unless you have any further comments. More than welcome to.
03:34:25.700 - 03:34:34.710, Speaker D: I think that's it for me, I will hop into the discord, and along with my friends at Filecoin and IPFS, we'll try to answer any questions that people have.
03:34:35.080 - 03:35:07.272, Speaker C: All right, thank you so much. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today for the IPFS and Filecoin Builders Day summit. Thank you to all the speakers, and thank you to the rest of the ETH Global Team for making this happen. I think we're all impressed by how things went today and excited to see what comes out of the next three weeks of hacks and summits. Don't forget, we do have a summit coming up again next week. Join us right here on eachglobal TV and don't miss a moment of the action. But other than that, happy hacking.
03:35:07.272 - 03:35:28.340, Speaker C: We're looking forward to seeing what you can build. Any questions, comments, or concerns, throw it in the discord and we'll help you out. Thank you for being a part of Hackfs. All right, we'll be closing the stream now. All right, thanks again, everybody. Take care.
