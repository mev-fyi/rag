00:00:06.330 - 00:00:39.270, Speaker A: We're going to be talking about NFTs and Metaverse for this panel. We'll have four amazing people join us. We have Dylan from Figma, we have Rohan from Dapper Labs, we have Marguerite from Neon District and Moderating. This panel will be Drew Austin from Red Beard Venture. Yours and I'll welcome all of them here and have Drew sort of go into introducing all of our panelists and having them talk about who they are. So without further ado, let's welcome our amazing panel.
00:00:51.410 - 00:00:53.822, Speaker B: How are we doing, everybody? Good.
00:00:53.876 - 00:00:54.798, Speaker C: How are you doing?
00:00:54.964 - 00:00:58.880, Speaker B: I'm doing good. Are we jumping right in? Ready to go?
00:01:00.770 - 00:01:01.726, Speaker A: Yes, you are.
00:01:01.828 - 00:01:02.606, Speaker C: Either way.
00:01:02.708 - 00:01:16.614, Speaker B: Let's go. Let's do it. All right. Hi everybody. I'm Drew Austin. I'm managing partner over at Redbeard Ventures. And just a really brief, we'll do a quick round of intros because I think everyone here has just got such an awesome story.
00:01:16.614 - 00:02:16.626, Speaker B: And then we will jump in and start talking Metaverse NFTs and see where it goes. So, my background, I've been a founder 15 years in different frontier technology companies and over the last twelve months started up a venture capital syndicate called Red Beard Ventures have been very active in the blockchain metaverse NFT space investors investing in two of the companies up here with Dapper and Marguerite's company as well, Brahm. So we've invested in a variety of different metaverses, from Wilder World to Superworld to Sandbox and Art Marketplaces, like Super Rare, and gaming companies like Zedrun. So we're really active in the space. We're really excited about investing in these ecosystems like the Flow ecosystem and some of the companies that are building on top of Flow. And personally, I'm an active investor in NFTs themselves. I'm the top 50 portfolio holder on TOPSHOT.
00:02:16.626 - 00:02:41.230, Speaker B: I have a big stable on Zed run and a lot of Sandbox land that we develop. And then recently we just released our own NFT project called Knights of Degen, which is a really cool project I did with a great team of people. And we're having a blast, man, just learning and building and creating and investing and just meeting great people. So that's been my story. Marguerite, you want to introduce yourself real quick? Absolutely.
00:02:41.300 - 00:03:02.854, Speaker D: Thanks, Drew. So Marguerite decorsel. I'm CEO of Blockade Games. We're building Neon District, which is a cyberpunk RPG. We have dynamic NFTs that evolve through the gameplay. I've been in this space, the Blockade has been around for about four years now. I've been in creative technology and in the crypto space specifically since 2014, was one of the first artists in this space.
00:03:02.854 - 00:03:39.700, Speaker D: I've gotten to be here and see the entire space evolve as we've been exploring what's possible for creatives with blockchain technology. So, of course I'm having a blast watching all the possibilities and iterations on NFTs and where we are today. Everything from know and seeing people explore the different gamification tactics, plus just fine art in general. Watching Sotheby's and Christie's take off and get around behind NFTs this year. It's been a blast. So anyways, I'm very passionate about the intersection of the metaverse, gaming, fine art and yeah, awesome.
00:03:40.150 - 00:03:41.538, Speaker B: Dylan, you want to go?
00:03:41.704 - 00:04:10.762, Speaker C: Sure. Hi everybody. Good to see you all. My name is Dylan. I'm the CEO and co founder of Figma. And we are a design platform, so trying to make it so you can do everything from whiteboard and brainstorm all the way to design UI and UX to get that code into production. And my interest in NFT started really with the crypto punks launch, started to track it, then was real lucky to kind of be on the earlier side there.
00:04:10.762 - 00:05:07.566, Speaker C: And then with OpenSea was thankful to me being a seed investor and have tried to be supportive and active in ecosystem since. And it's been amazing to watch this past six months, eight months, nine months, whatever. I don't know what time is. And to see what's happening in the world of NFTs, I think it's just an absolutely fascinating primitive that we're going to see be explored in so many different ways. And I think even on this call, we've got a few different ways that it's being explored that we can talk about. I remember actually at ETH Denver, when Neon District launched from the Hackathon project and I was like, that's fucking cool. So it's just awesome to think about at this event, what will be the projects that will be like the next Neon District or actually, I remember when my wife then girlfriend was at ETH Waterloo, and she's like, man, I just saw this really cool thing.
00:05:07.566 - 00:05:15.394, Speaker C: It's called CryptoKitties. So there's been so many amazing projects that have come out of the ETH Global ecosystem and I can't wait to see what's going to come out of this one.
00:05:15.592 - 00:05:16.980, Speaker B: Awesome. Ro.
00:05:17.990 - 00:05:52.586, Speaker E: Yeah. Thanks, Drew. My name is Ron Gargosloof, co founder and CEO of Dapper Labs. We've been big believers in the NFT space for a while. Authored the original ERC 721 standard on ethereum built CryptoKitties, most recently focused on NBA TOPSHOT and taking the NFTs to the sports world. And you might have seen we announced the legal partnership a couple of days ago, another big one coming next week. And we're also the original developers behind the flow blockchain, which at this point has several thousand developers and Fortune 500 companies building on top of it.
00:05:52.586 - 00:06:24.226, Speaker E: But I have a very soft spot in my heart for ETH Global events exactly because of what Dylan mentioned. I don't think CryptoKitties would have happened if it wasn't for ETH Global. And just bringing the community together, giving we put little pictures of cats on Pokemon cards and it was sort of the first time. It's like, hey, cats can be collectible too. And sort of getting that kind of energy to kick off the project was super critical. So really excited to be here and to talk NFTs. I think we're absolutely at the start of this journey.
00:06:24.226 - 00:06:34.730, Speaker E: And so everyone here is right place, right time. Four years ago, maybe we're a little bit early, we had to grind a little bit. But I think the next four years is going to be going to be super fast.
00:06:34.880 - 00:07:26.970, Speaker B: All right, awesome. So let's start a little bit. I think it's really interesting we have so many different approaches. I think there are some things like it's obvious when you think of Blockchain and NFTs that gaming has a place for it, sports cards have a place for Get, art has a place for it. Does anyone find it interesting? And what are your thoughts on this PFP movement, the profile picture movement? It is fascinating to me that of all the things that really would have struck a chord with people, that these PFP concepts and communities really took off. And I'm curious, your mean you've been in this space for so long and you've been involved in some of the, I would say some of the more complex but also powerful concepts behind NFTs. This is kind of simple in a way, but powerful in itself.
00:07:26.970 - 00:07:28.778, Speaker B: So what are your thoughts on it?
00:07:28.944 - 00:08:21.980, Speaker D: You know, what I think is really interesting about that is it is like the most tangible. I feel like when we think about the beginning of NFTs and how people can understand what they are, like the fact you can have these generative experiences of creating these images, there's really no in a lot of cases, there's not a real formula that's like a gamified formula to them. They're just like here's this drop and then we've generated all these and then there's just rarities assigned to the different versions that are created, which I think back to CryptoKitties and how much more CryptoKitties was way more sophisticated and conceptually how they had DNA and just the components. So I find it interesting that people the complexity and what was interesting as far as smart contract development around CryptoKitties as well is not being utilized in most cases with these PFP projects. It's really just the art. It's like this visual understanding of the transfer. We can transfer the images and people are just excited about that.
00:08:21.980 - 00:09:29.390, Speaker D: They're really excited about the most simple part of the entire world of what we're developing around NFTs. And actually Dylan with Moji. Like, I have an ethmoji. Ethmoji was one of the first PFP sort of projects where you have an avatar and actually I believe you worked alongside the OpenSea founding team prior to OpenSea on so you had this composable. It's a composable avatar, essentially, and it's a user driven, so you can build them. When are we going to get from people from this phase of being given these generative pieces to where they get more excited about having hands on building? As far as the outcome, I think everyone's learning that a limited distribution of 10,000 assets only for the function of this idea of creating rarity, but then we're paywalling out any continued distribution of that model doesn't really work. And I think everyone that's building games like Roham knows, I know you know this, the real trick is to have super wide distribution and then introduce Rarity in a way that's protected by a game design that can build the ecosystem.
00:09:29.390 - 00:09:56.940, Speaker D: So anyways, I think that it's great that people are exploring art and they're experimenting with crossover of community and intersections and interests, but I do think everyone's learning very gradually that you see people in real time asking like, oh, this is a problem and how do we solve it? And so people are walking through this path together and they're all walking towards gaming, they just haven't realized it yet. We've all been here, what, for four years, building this, and so we're just.
00:10:00.430 - 00:10:57.280, Speaker B: Like the funny thing is for me, so I bought my first collectibles. My first NFT ever was maybe it was a crypto kitty, but the one I really remember was Super Rare's Art. For some reason, that's what really completely transformed my perspective. I think it was the end of 2018 and I bought some art on Super Rare and I was just like, that was it for me. I was hooked because the concept made so much sense. Now I preached art, I preached crypto to a lot of my non crypto friends and no one came near crypto until TOPSHOT because that was what got my social circle to finally have text groups that they actually were active in, where we were talking about crypto and NFTs every day. So Rome, what are your thoughts on this, on Topshot's role in bringing these new people into the NFT community and then seeing them migrate to PFPs? And how that's going to translate into the further evolution of the space? Tell me what your thoughts are.
00:10:57.810 - 00:12:12.342, Speaker E: Look, I think the profile picture, I have a board Ape, I think I'm a supporter of all of these projects, but I think they're still pretty small. They're much more status games for the ultra wealthy than they are anything that can sort of directly translate to millions or hundreds of millions of people. And then if you look at even art, like Art Blocks has about 20,000, 19,000 total owners. The only projects that sort of get close to breaking double digits, triple digits, are Z, Axe and TOPSHOT. And it's because they have that funnel that Marguerite is talking about where you can kind of get started without a huge investment and you can do stuff, you can get into habits in a sense. And I think that the profile pictures are today kind of an amazing, sort of a, an experience for the wealthy. And I think that's been in particular, the board Apkov has pulled it off really well where they're creating so much community value out of the assets, but they're also a hint towards what's going to be coming.
00:12:12.342 - 00:13:04.706, Speaker E: I'm sure some of the folks here heard that Twitter is putting in authentication for an entrepreneurship. You can kind of say, hey, this is my avatar. And to Marguerite's point, I think what the masses will want is more customization, is more just interactivity with their product, maybe earning things for their avatar as things grow. And that's a big reason why we've been really big fans of Genies and leaned in with the Genies team because we think they're taking kind of a Gen Z first approach to saying, well, if we're all going to live in digital worlds and we need digital identities, how do most people want those digital identities to work? Now, ultra wealthy, for sure. You want the Picasso on your wall, right? But not that many people can afford that. There's sort of how do we bridge from here to there? Is going to be really an interesting exercise.
00:13:04.818 - 00:13:35.300, Speaker B: Totally. Dylan, I think it's always funny, and you're very much involved in creative and art and this stuff is like in your world. I sometimes find it funny how my friends now talk about art and it's kind of like it's almost like to the point where we're at a bus stop, they see an AV, oh, look at the art on that bus stop. Anything is now art. Art has become the art. It's really getting spec. It's really interesting now people's definition of art like, oh, did you see the art on that camel? It's like, oh, God.
00:13:35.300 - 00:13:46.822, Speaker B: What is your thoughts on what this is doing for the art world as well, and the creative world? And is it a good thing, is it a bad thing? What are your thoughts there?
00:13:46.956 - 00:14:26.850, Speaker C: Oh, it's a great and obviously I'm highly biased in the know. A significant portion of my net worth is in NFTs. But I think the question of what is art usually drives art forward. And regardless of whether we see NFT, art markets crash when a crypto cycle comes, I wouldn't be surprised, right, sometime the next two years, maybe sooner, quite a bit sooner, we'll probably see a crypto crash. Crypto is a cyclic asset. It's not going to be up and up forever, despite the mania that we're all in right now. And that doesn't mean that it doesn't have significance.
00:14:26.850 - 00:15:28.674, Speaker C: I think there's great significance here, and I think that you have to basically separate the significance of sort of the conceptual from the actual monetary volume that's changing hands. And that's kind of why I think that the term collector is sometimes overused because there's a lot of speculators in the space that's okay, speculators are sort of like creating liquidity pools for people to be able to buy this artwork and be able to invest in artists. But I think if you zoom out to just some of the macro trends that are going on, we're going from a physical economy to a digital economy. And that digital economy. People want digital goods because they're living online, right? And I think that as we are navigating that digital economy, whether it's a profile picture, I've thought that several times, oh man, profile picture projects are dead. And then I'm always reminded of sort of like, was it the patent office in the early 19 hundreds, 18 hundreds, whatever it was. And they're like, oh yeah, not sure any more patents will exist.
00:15:28.674 - 00:16:17.810, Speaker C: After some time, we should probably just shut it down. Then you see projects like Ford API Club or you see projects like the Noun Project, where you've got actually some incredible group of people coming together to be able to buy a Noun every single day, contribute the funds to a Dow, and have that Dow then be able to vote on what they should do. Their first act actually being charitable contribution, which I thought was incredible. And so I think that every time we think that we see the limits of some type of the medium, we're going to see further innovation because we've taken somehow we've created this honeypot for the world's creatives. And they've come to it. And they've realized that there's actually some money there as well, and that for some of them, they can actually subsist off that. And from there, that unblocks their creativity.
00:16:17.810 - 00:16:51.822, Speaker C: And I think that Loot is another great example of that. I'm obsessed with it, have been obsessed since it launched. It's such an exciting project to me because here's an example of rather than having a franchise like Sports or a created universe like Neon District, which are both amazing, right? But instead it's like, let's go world build together. Let's go figure out how as a community, we can create a new world. Which I think really gets the definition of metaverse. No one really knows what metaverse means. It's this collection of loose terms right now.
00:16:51.822 - 00:17:09.480, Speaker C: I'm pretty sure it has something to do with decentralization. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the yes and principle of improv. I'm pretty sure it has to do with building on each other's works and derivative projects. And Loot, to me, is right the center of all those things. And so I get very excited about that project and just see what comes from it.
00:17:10.810 - 00:17:46.378, Speaker B: That's awesome. Next driver of growth. I guess my theory, if I think about the thesis here, it's like I saw we were in the speculation phase with Crypto from 2013 to 18. Then there was the ICO bubble that crashed. The winter hit. Shit, companies died, good companies built, and out came DFI. And I think DFI brought utility and an entirely new wave of value to the tokens that were able to sustain that winter, were well funded with great teams, and be able to then rise above and now have a phenomenal utility of kind of rebuilding the financial infrastructure from the ground up.
00:17:46.378 - 00:18:08.662, Speaker B: In my perspective. And Marguerite, you might even say this was farther back, but I feel like we've been in the NFT space since 2018. That's just my view. Maybe it's like 2017 or even 16. And it's been a speculation phase as well. Like people speculating, buying, selling. The foundational principles are we like to buy dope shit and we want to make money while we do it.
00:18:08.662 - 00:18:10.842, Speaker B: And that's kind of a lot of those.
00:18:10.976 - 00:19:03.258, Speaker C: I actually kind of disagree with that. I think it's important that people know there's a corner of the Internet that's like long term collectors that believe that there's a canon being created of NFT art. And that art. Like, for example, I'm a member of Fingerprints Dao, which takes the thesis they're the sort of on chain art that is going to be the sort of native art form for NFTs and Blockchain and their entire philosophy sorry, which one was that? You said fingerprints now. And their philosophy is to this is when I started to get really involved. I asked the creator, he had bought an autoglyph that I wanted, and I said, hey, can I buy that off of you guys? And he said, Sorry, our entire point of view and philosophy. And I was like, Sign me up.
00:19:03.258 - 00:19:13.614, Speaker C: I want to be as involved in this dow as possible, because that was exactly what I was looking for. I do want to just correct that because I think that not everyone is a speculator in the space.
00:19:13.732 - 00:19:47.378, Speaker B: Sure, okay. So that's totally fair, I would say. I guess from my perspective, the broad audience and if you think about most of the buzz and conversation, has a lot to do with speculation. There are people that are deeper. Absolutely. But I think the most driver of use around S NFTs in the short term, in the near term, at least from what I've seen with my networks of people that weren't even crypto, people that are now entering the space, is speculation of price and speculation of value and speculation of long term or short term value. But then I guess my point being here is that we go through this speculation phase just like we did with crypto.
00:19:47.378 - 00:20:09.066, Speaker B: There will be a winter eventually at some point, and out of that I think you come the metaverse, which is the true native, whereas the native home for these assets. But in between that, I think the metaverse is still a ways away. True ways away. What do you think are the nearest term? Next? Innovative drivers of adoption of NFTs. Marguerite, it looks like you're.
00:20:09.098 - 00:20:48.346, Speaker D: Yeah, so I actually throw this at Dylan. I really believe that there's two spectrums. When we think about the spectrum of innovation and what you're seeing, why we might experience winters, because there's a lot to be built still. And on one end we're going to be exploring interactive NFTs and what infrastructure and framework will want for that across all the different applications. What we're going to need from our marketplaces to support that across the different applications. To the other side is a no code remixing platforms, which I think Dylan is completely positioned to just knock it out of the park. Everything from his proof of concept with Ethmoji to now his platform with.
00:20:48.346 - 00:20:51.710, Speaker D: So I want to know when are we going to have a no code remixing platform?
00:20:51.780 - 00:21:31.266, Speaker C: Dylan well, I don't know about, uh, in terms of when that will, but I'm certainly not building it right now. But I love the idea of remixing and I think actually some examples of that recently. Just to call out some projects that I think are really cool here one that I saw was Deafbeef and Deafbeef has a series of projects and they're basically audiovisual experiments on the blockchain. They have the C code to render the projects in the smart contract. And then they have a series of different artwork. One of them, series three is called Entropy. And for Entropy, whenever it's transferred, the artwork changes and degrades.
00:21:31.266 - 00:21:37.110, Speaker C: Kind of like if you have a record vinyl, the more you play it, the more scratchy it gets. It's a similar sort of fashion.
00:21:37.190 - 00:21:37.626, Speaker B: That's cool.
00:21:37.648 - 00:22:32.074, Speaker C: Another one that I thought was really interesting was Blitknots and Blitmaps. And so Blitmaps, basically you had this entire process they used to basically mint on chain the artwork itself. You could do things like compose and translate the color palettes as well as to draw. And then from there you could buy the Blitmaps if you had missed that phase and actually mint what's called a blitz knot, which is sort of the next character in their created universe, also partially on chain. And I think that that was also really interesting as a derivative work. The third that I'll point out is kind of similar to both ideas, which is this project that not many people have seen yet called Animal Coloring Book, which is an example of basically you discover the properties of the NFT as you are then minting it and then transferring it. So every time it transfers, it's an additive thing.
00:22:32.074 - 00:23:21.690, Speaker C: Sort of the opposite of the series three deaf beef. Example you have an NFT called Cat and I have some outline of a cat and then I transfer it over to you, Marguerite. And you get the outline of the face and then you transfer it to Rohan and he's got the eyes and you transfer to Drew. And the eyes are kind of like googly eyes. And it's just really neat because you kind of discover the NFT as it's transferred. And I think one thing that is going to also be really important for NFTs is your knowledge proofs. I think if you think about remixability composability and also just gameplay, if you are playing World of Warcraft and you have your bag of items, it's really important that people don't know exactly what's in your bag.
00:23:21.690 - 00:23:41.810, Speaker C: And zero knowledge proofs. I think you could actually use them in the future. Not saying that we all have figured out exactly how to do this today. But one day we're going to have a world where people can play these games and have items that others do not know they have. And I think that'll be just as important as the status games that people are playing on Twitter today with profile pictures.
00:23:42.790 - 00:23:51.270, Speaker B: Ron, what do you think? What do you think are going to be that's awesome? What do you think are going to be the next major near term drivers of unique adoption?
00:23:52.970 - 00:24:38.870, Speaker E: Well, I think you're seeing it kind of across the board and I just want to say it's true that crypto is cyclical and will go through up and down markets, and especially NFTs that rely on a lot of speculative energy will be affected. Gaming historically does really well in sort of recessions of all kinds. Entertainment is something people need through thick and thin. We launched TOPSHOT during a time when nobody cared what NFTs were and people came to it. I mean, admittedly there was an excitement about trading cards, basketball games weren't happening. And so it just kind of tapped into a zeitgeist in a particular way even back then. But it wasn't related to sort of crypto specifically, nor kind of the markets more generally.
00:24:38.870 - 00:26:00.494, Speaker E: And so I think especially when we go through sort of that cycle, you'll see NFT projects that are much more about the communities they're serving and much less about tapping into a sort of stream of speculative energy in a way to kind of market make and get into, as Dylan was saying. And I think that'll be good. It'll be a good chance for people to get in at the ground floor. I think that gaming is the sort of driver of adoption for millions of people, other than I think what we're doing in sports is something that TOPSHOT itself can go from a million users to a billion users. NBA fans, we're expanding to three 4 billion sports fans with soccer, et cetera, but kind of seeing what, let's say, projects like Chain Monsters are doing where they're taking simplified gameplay from things like Pokemon, but giving true ownership, giving trading, creating meta economies around it, that's going to be exciting for people through thick and thin. And then on the flip side is sort of music. I think it was Chris Dixon that said music is the industry where the biggest gap between sort of what the customer wants and even sort of what the artist is able to do or able to monetize, because there's so many kind of middlemen, there's so many established interests, there's so many kind of red tape in between.
00:26:00.494 - 00:26:17.822, Speaker E: And whether it's sort of projects like sort of record shop or audience or others, I think there's so much opportunity in kind of bringing fans closer to people they care about. And so those are sort of three spaces. So sports, gaming, music are kind of what I get really excited about.
00:26:17.896 - 00:26:52.830, Speaker B: Totally. And I think it's interesting that I think most people I speak to are incredibly excited about play to earn and the play to earn concept and great gaming. And I still think we're so early in that area. I look at Axio Infinity, it's kind of an OD game to be the game that's like the face of play to earn, in my opinion. But I actually think there's a step before that which is own to earn. So there's like own to earn and then I think that we get to play to earn. And I think the own to earn is kind of what we're seeing where DeFi is kind of leaning into the NFT space.
00:26:52.830 - 00:27:12.834, Speaker B: And by having certain types of assets, I think music could be the perfect home for the own to earn economy, which is a lot of people are now talking about are you going to get royalties by owning a piece of an NFT that when music is played, you get a percentage of those royalties. What are you guys thoughts on that before we move into playdar?
00:27:12.962 - 00:27:19.970, Speaker C: I think it's super exciting. I mean the idea of NFTs is a productive asset, which is also part of Marguerite's reference to Ethmoji.
00:27:20.050 - 00:27:25.306, Speaker B: Sorry Drew, I said it creates freedom for people to have those passive income streams is so important.
00:27:25.488 - 00:28:17.450, Speaker C: Exactly. And that was also partially the idea of Ethmoji was the base layers you could have or even just the things you build on top of that, if you made a derivative work, then you would get some income off of the new mint. But yeah, I think that's an very exciting idea. And also just the idea of having some way to have the rights to an artist that you really like. It actually will bootstrap new artists in the ecosystem because basically you're betting on then you're saying, okay, let me go discover indie artists, find the ones that I think I'm going to take off, that are going to take off, get rights to some of their music, or fractionalized rights to some of their music, of course. And then from there that will actually create income for me if I'm right. And so it enables this sort of class of people that are these super fans of what's next in the music world to actually monetize their passion.
00:28:17.450 - 00:28:54.498, Speaker C: And I think that could become really big, really fast. I also think that just as long as we're talking about other categories of what could come with NFTs, I think we're all still trying to imagine what this metaverse concept can be and how this patchwork of decentralized systems will come together. And no one knows yet, but I think that there will be a world one day that more people are spending time in online. We're already seeing that we're already spending time online, we're just not doing it in a very interesting way. And so I think that when I grew.
00:28:54.514 - 00:28:54.598, Speaker B: Up.
00:28:54.604 - 00:29:49.846, Speaker C: I played neopets right? And that was like a huge part of my childhood. I think that if you think about the fast forward of that to World of Warcraft, to other MMOs to then okay, games like Dark Forest, which I think are way more interesting than Axie Infinity to me because that's an example of a complex strategy game that basically incorporates NFTs as game items is built in WebGL on a layer two years and zero knowledge proofs in order to mine partions of the map that you can't see. Otherwise there's so much exploration that can happen here, it's only a matter of time before the first shipwread game comes out with NFTs. But it's also just a matter of time before someone builds a virtual world that actual goods and services will be represented and property will be remembered as more NFTs. We're already seeing some of that, but I think we're going to see it a different level soon and I can't wait. I'm really excited for what that'll be.
00:29:49.948 - 00:30:37.526, Speaker B: So that's like making me want to go in a couple of different directions, but I'm going to start here first. Well, one, let's talk Play to Earn for a quick second because I think there's before I get into the metaverse part of this, which I really want to get to, what are your thoughts on the future of work when we think about like, how does it impact the future of work? Because I have some weird philosophical thoughts on what could happen to society if this takes off the way it could. Marguerite, what are your thoughts on I also come from an HR tech, I just sold an HR tech company. So when they think of Play to work, they think of digital transformation. I'm sitting here thinking like, dude, we're all going to be working in the metaverse. That's the future of work. But what is your thoughts on the play to earn and future of work kind of situation?
00:30:37.708 - 00:31:41.050, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think that the challenge that we're facing right now with building out these experiences is play to Earn is really boughtable unless it is protected by a very strong game design. And so even in DeFi and even Dark Forest, dark Forest, like it's really a game of who can build the best bot, which is a game, sure, but is that fun for the person that's just trying to participate and walk in and it's a normal casual player? No, that's not fun. Right, so how do we build out experiences online that can engage an abstract human puzzle solving part of our capacity that is different and is not boughtable? And that actually is pretty complicated to build those kinds of game designs. So I think that the space is currently exploring what has worked for the gaming industry and for a lot of these problems and protecting economies and we're trying to adopt them also with our blockchain game economies. So with the play to earn model honestly games. And the likelihood of games failing is gigantic. And that's why games it's really hard for investors to invest in gaming all by themselves.
00:31:41.050 - 00:32:41.230, Speaker D: Now we've done this brilliant idea of adding blockchain applications, which are also very likely to fail, that have never been built before with games that are also innovative and very likely to fail. And everyone's just going to try to figure out what formulas are working. So that's why I think it's totally okay that people like Loot, we're starting very small at a proof of concept. We're finding the most fundamentally sticky thing about the experience. And then I believe we're going to see projects that are successful from there, get funding because they've proven a sticky formula and they're going to be able to go build a whole concept and game universe around those experiences. So I do feel like right now to iterative building, build fast and fail hard should be everybody's, especially if you're just an engineer and you're just trying to get a proof of concept off the ground. But I don't think it's the right move to go do something crazy ambitious like build your own blockchain ecosystem simultaneous with building a whole new AA game studio, even if you have industry experience on one of those fronts.
00:32:41.230 - 00:33:07.878, Speaker D: Roham. I remember when Roham launched Flow and I was like, are you sure that that's a good idea? Anyways, I'm really excited about seeing all these little projects get off the ground because there's so much potential in various ways of so it's great seeing things like Loot and these other projects being incredibly successful and you can see that there's something magical there and the community get behind it.
00:33:07.964 - 00:33:22.640, Speaker B: All right, so before I move on to my next question, I have to let Roham respond to being called Roham. Roham, is it crazy to have to be building your own blockchain while you're building a game studio, while you're building games and IP and all this other stuff?
00:33:23.010 - 00:34:04.554, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, it was nuts and we almost weren't able to do it. And don't forget, we also had to build the payment rails. Right. Dapper wallet today is still the best user experience for crypto payments. And we process over a billion dollars there. And it's fully compliant, fully sort of regulatory, very kind of well lit experience, the kind of thing that the NBA and global brands want to use. That's why Genie's is plugging into Dapper on Flow, because they're going to be bringing the billions of fans of their partners and their artists and all those things.
00:34:04.554 - 00:34:26.562, Speaker E: And what are those folks going to do? Go. Download MetaMask. It's just not going to work. Have to acquire cryptocurrency. Just not going to work. And then when it comes to Flow, when you're looking at Ethereum, you're looking at L two S and then other blockchains. There are security trade offs moving off of ETH mainnet, but ETH mainnet is too expensive for most things.
00:34:26.562 - 00:35:29.850, Speaker E: And so when Shopify was looking for a blockchain for Shopify partners to be able to NFTs, they chose Flow. When other Fortune Five Hundred S are looking at the kind of network that can support not just the scale or at the cost, but also the user experience, the customer trust, we choose Flow. Flow has got 2 million active wallets right now, million of those verified unique users from Dapper, a million of those across the other sort of noncustodial ecosystems. Those are normal people. They're coming to play chain monsters and play NBA TOPSHOT and use record Shop and all these things they're not coming to we don't really have yet the kind of DeFi ecosystem that would bring kind of the traders and the speculators, even though that's possible. So was it crazy? Absolutely. But no question we made the right call because now I'm looking at what's happening gas wars and Ethereum, we're looking at smart contracts.
00:35:29.850 - 00:36:09.670, Speaker E: We built our own programming language. Cadence was built from the ground up for not just NFTs, but also the kind of smart contracts we need, the more complex kinds of smart contracts that A, we had to write four years ago for CryptoKitties, but B when you come into Dows, when you come into Composable games, every single step has to be thought of. So we didn't do it lightly, right? Like, I spoke to Vitalik multiple times, we went through every other layer one architect, and then we spoke to some of the layer two teams, although back then it was Rohan.
00:36:09.690 - 00:36:17.010, Speaker B: Did you ever consider building a layer two as opposed to going like building a version of a matic for your own instead of that?
00:36:17.080 - 00:37:16.534, Speaker E: We always figured, look, we weren't interested in saying let's build a Band Aid solution, we're interested in saying, ten years from now, who's building the right trade off space for consumer apps? And no one was and no one is, right? Like the path people are taking are either splitting things into layer twos, going down the road of Sharding, reducing decentralization, all of this stuff. And Flow today isn't everything it'll be in 510 years, but we're very confident it's the right trade off space. Nobody was thinking, oh, we need to write our own spark contract language. Everybody's thinking, oh, let's use Rust, that's a great idea, or Solidity is fine, it's been around for four years. We just disagree. Nobody is thinking of rethinking web three or saying, well, why not have MetaMask, et cetera, and then just use centralized wallets when you need it? We disagree. We think you need a wallet application interface that lets users take custody of that same wallet, right, cycle keys through it.
00:37:16.534 - 00:37:45.342, Speaker E: And it's all of these bits and pieces where we couldn't convince anybody to sort of adopt our approach and we didn't want to just build an appendage to someone else's network. We think that this is the right trade off space and someone's going to eventually figure it out. And so we said, well, might as well build it ourselves. Launch it with the NBA, bring on board, and then blow up, open the gates, right? Let anybody build on top, let anybody host nodes. And that's the path that's going down.
00:37:45.476 - 00:38:05.240, Speaker C: We just want to add one thing. I'll keep it really short. I think both Roham and Marguerite are correct in different ways here. So Marguerite .1 of her points was, if you want to be a successful gaming company, you need to launch a lot of things, do it really fast, test your concepts, and iterate on them. I think it's absolutely true. Games are a hit business.
00:38:05.240 - 00:38:46.660, Speaker C: Roham's point was that usability matters. You got to do whatever you can to get usability to work, even if it means doing the crazy things. And I think that we do need more people that are going to do really hard, long term projects in this ecosystem. Dark Forest, for example, is one of those. I was really impressed with them because they integrated a wallet into the gameplay on top of a layer two, right? And they went and did a lot of UX improvements because they also said MetaMask, no one's going to use it, and that's not the way that the future of gaming is going to look. And so we're just in a stage, and I also from Figma, have that bias. It took five years from going from starting Figma to making our first dime from a customer, right? And so just like these things take time.
00:38:46.660 - 00:39:04.860, Speaker C: And I think that if you're working on gaming, maybe try to do these short sprints, but sign up for a long time period and know that it's not all going to work. And if you want to do the large, big project, that's fucking awesome, go do it and find ways to fund it and use the community that's around you to support you and try to rally those.
00:39:06.270 - 00:39:28.018, Speaker B: I want to I know we don't have too much time, but I want to hit the metaverse stuff for a quick second. So my big question here, do you think the metaverse takes off? And when I say take off and I know so, Dylan, you actually have kind of opened up the definition of a metaverse in a bunch of directions, but in the least division in my head. Do you think the metaverse takes off pre VR or do we need I.
00:39:28.024 - 00:39:29.060, Speaker C: Think it already has.
00:39:30.070 - 00:39:30.866, Speaker B: Okay?
00:39:31.048 - 00:39:33.838, Speaker C: Look at Roblox. Roblox is a metaverse.
00:39:33.934 - 00:39:37.198, Speaker B: Okay. I guess that's kind of where I'm.
00:39:37.214 - 00:39:51.050, Speaker C: Going with it might not be a metaverse that we like in terms of it being decentralized. It might not be a metaverse we like in terms of, like it's a lot of kids using it. It's not like a lot of adults using it, but I bet a lot of kids really want Roblox instead of dollars right now.
00:39:51.200 - 00:40:02.250, Speaker B: Yeah. So your approach is do you think that VR is even needed for the metaverse to thrive?
00:40:03.630 - 00:40:27.254, Speaker C: I think that it's VR AR are technologies that are coming and over our lifespans. They'll be just as important as mobile devices or screens. When exactly I cannot tell you, but I think they will become that. And I think that people are already living online and I think that the fidelity at which they experience these metaverses will go up.
00:40:27.452 - 00:41:03.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess because when I think about this, it's like we're buying assets for a digital world. We're spending more and more time in a digital world. The theory that I have is that eventually our digital world needs to become more immersive to facilitate a truly kind of almost human esque, like know. Marguerite, what is your like? Do you think VR is going to play a big role in gaming and in the driving of adoption of NFTs? And do we have to just wait till Apple decides to throw their hat in the ring? What's your thoughts here?
00:41:04.230 - 00:41:43.994, Speaker D: No, I think the open metaverse is going to win. And I think users love collaborating and building and having the tools to participate. And you can't do that and have that same ownership experience in a walled garden. No one wants to go build Facebook's metaverse. No one's attracted to mean maybe there's a certain user, but I can tell you the broader everyone that wants to build the communities doesn't want to go do Facebook's work for them. And so I think that already a little bit of what Dylan said is we're already here. I think that the little experimentation and the collaborative building, I think that is the beginnings of the metaverse.
00:41:43.994 - 00:42:25.574, Speaker D: I don't know that there's going to be a definitive moment. I think there's just going to be intersections of projects that emerge and they just continue stacking on top of each other and then people are going to work on those tech stacks to make different experiences possible and then people are going to have APIs that connect. I think first of that is OpenSea. I think OpenSea is the hub of the metaverse right now. I think the game is inventory management and that's the bottom of the funnel at the moment. And instead of everyone focusing there and you're talking about speculation. For example, Neon District, we have 130,000 asset owners now and it's a free to play game so people can onboard.
00:42:25.574 - 00:43:21.274, Speaker D: And with that wide distribution, since it's free and you can just walk right into the game and then we introduce scarcity and people can use their accumulation of the in game currency, Neon, which is not a token, it's just like wow, gold. To buy and participate and compete for these rare assets, that is like for me, we're creating our own universe. There's definitely an emphasis on creating our universe, but it's a particular intersection and I have no doubt there's going to be overlapping Ven diagrams of where neon districts and our user base participates in other communities. But I do think like giving our users tools to help build outside quests help build outside stories have a Star Wars type universe where we drive major narrative experiences properties create the core economic value but give the opportunity and the bridges for other side economies to be building off of is going to be like that model for me is basically a microcosm of what I think will be the macro of the metaverse. And I think we are already building the tools and the assets that will be a part of it.
00:43:21.392 - 00:44:12.490, Speaker C: Yeah, one thing I'll add to Marguerite's points she remind me of is just how important distribution is. It's a really boring topic when we're talking about the future, but just if you're building a game, you need distribution and that's a huge channel for you. And so I think that's one of the reasons I'm so excited about things like Loot is because it creates an inherent distribution channel, which is all the holders of Loot, especially as that ecosystem gets built up and people know where to look. When I think about the open metaverse, I think one of the challenges that we have to solve to make it work, which I also heavily subscribe to, like Marguerite, I really want that to happen versus like having some evil monopolist overlord, which is basically every other metaverse funk fiction. They all have one. And I think what's important is how do we create distribution for people that are creating projects in this open metaverse?
00:44:12.830 - 00:44:39.334, Speaker B: Very cool. Okay, so we only have three minutes left, so I'm going to ask a quick question for each person, real quick. Name a project that you're excited about right now. An NFT project. Everyone's got their own little fun projects they're excited about. I'll drop one that I think is pretty cool because you guys just mentioned Loot. There's a project a budy of mine is involved in building called Geohashes, and I think Geohashes is super interesting because it's also another derivative project.
00:44:39.334 - 00:45:16.946, Speaker B: But they built this derivative project over Google Earth. So anyone that needs to use mapping and locations and proximity, they created this whole really interesting model around a Geohash, encodes a geographic location into a short string of letters, and then you can do whatever you want with that building block. So I thought that was like in the spirit of Loot, I think we're going to see other building blocks like that that are going to come out. And now I'm really excited to see what games and what ways people utilize this stuff. So that was one that I just thought was worth calling out. Dylan, tell me one that you're excited about.
00:45:17.048 - 00:45:21.954, Speaker C: I've already talked a lot about loot, deaf beef. Others sorry.
00:45:21.992 - 00:45:24.898, Speaker B: Dylan is it deaf?
00:45:25.064 - 00:46:01.770, Speaker C: Yeah, deaf. B-E-E-F-I think that that's just the potential of on chain media there is really exciting. What I'll talk about instead is just sort of what I calling the NFT chain rule which is basically that a meme's value is proportional to the number of derivatives that are made off of it. And so I think as you're looking at projects so this is the meta answer, but as you're looking at projects, I think that the projects that will have the most value are the ones that will ultimately spawn derivatives. And I think that that's one thing to keep in mind as you're looking at different projects.
00:46:01.850 - 00:46:04.766, Speaker B: Do you think the derivatives have value? It's a huge debate about that.
00:46:04.868 - 00:46:09.074, Speaker C: No, I think that actually the derivatives create value. I know for the thing that they.
00:46:09.112 - 00:46:14.638, Speaker B: Create derivatives on, I agree with that part. The question is do you think the derivatives that are created are also valuable.
00:46:14.734 - 00:46:16.470, Speaker C: If they also have derivatives?
00:46:17.450 - 00:46:20.680, Speaker B: That's well played. Well played. Marguerite, what do you got?
00:46:21.290 - 00:47:12.146, Speaker D: Yeah, so actually I'm launching a new Interactive NFT in a collaboration with Tim King, he's also known as Illustrator and we made an Interactive NFT. So it's with Beat mixing, taking stems of a famous artist that we were working with for a major brand for a big drop. It's one of their first big brands, first drops and anyways, it's a game also. So as you remix the stems according to how it's supposed to be produced, there's know of course with me making crypto puzzles, naturally there's like a crypto puzzle type game remixing. But the fact you can even do this from opensea's asset page directly with Iframe support and I'm excited about this because of a couple things. One Interactive, NFTs and Gaming directly from Asset pages. But then two, the fact that with music and stems, I believe this is a proof of concept.
00:47:12.146 - 00:47:40.734, Speaker D: Imagine you could have entire library of stems in which people could use for remixing purposes to create new content and new Interactive NFTs for different experiences. You can have live streams of DJing and having audio visualizers that match and so you could have these NFTs that are showing you've got a DJ streaming or a radio station that's playing. There's so much to play with. So I'm excited because that's kind of like a side project I've been working on and it's dropping in about two.
00:47:40.932 - 00:47:44.980, Speaker B: Cool, very cool. Roman Rohan, what's excited for you?
00:47:46.070 - 00:48:24.350, Speaker E: I already mentioned chain monsters. They just did a million dollar drop last week which went really well. Chain Monsters? Yeah, that's the sort of Pokemon derivative and people are starting to kind of think about well, what does it mean to build on top of these things? The Dr. Seuss app just went into testing and that's cool because it's mobile first, it's also trading first. So it's less about flipping for high dollar amounts, more about trading and completing sets and then this sort of thing. So you all should sign up for that. And then as an art platform.
00:48:24.350 - 00:48:55.270, Speaker E: I really like versus. And all of these are on flow. Versus sort of totally on chain. The actual site itself is also serverless, and it's a really neat setup because it kind of pits the big whale against the community. And it says, well, will the thing become a one of one, or will it become more of an addition where multiple people can have access? Those are some of the ones I'm playing around with.
00:48:55.420 - 00:48:59.320, Speaker B: Awesome. Awesome. And where can we find you guys what's Twitter handles real quick?
00:49:00.490 - 00:49:06.386, Speaker C: Dylan at Zoink Z-O-I-N-K zoink Roham. I'm boring.
00:49:06.418 - 00:49:07.346, Speaker E: I'm just Rohan.
00:49:07.458 - 00:49:11.754, Speaker D: Roham Margarit I'm coin underscore artist.
00:49:11.882 - 00:49:16.558, Speaker B: Okay. And I'm at Drew Austin. Guys, this is a lot of fun. Carthique, thanks for having us. This is great.
00:49:16.644 - 00:49:18.398, Speaker C: Thank you guys. Thanks for having us.
00:49:18.564 - 00:49:24.590, Speaker A: Thanks again for this amazing talk and much for moderating. Drew, this isn't great. Thanks again.
00:49:24.660 - 00:49:25.326, Speaker C: See everybody.
00:49:25.428 - 00:49:25.900, Speaker E: Take care, everybody.
