00:00:00.570 - 00:00:15.200, Speaker A: I left all night cause I know your heart I'm trying looking for someone to forget cause I gave you my whole life and is that you give me nothing and you let me.
00:00:38.910 - 00:00:39.334, Speaker B: Ladies.
00:00:39.382 - 00:00:54.042, Speaker C: And gentlemen, the East Boston opening ceremony is beginning in five minutes in the Revolution main stage. Please proceed to the Revolution main stage for the opening ceremonies.
00:00:54.186 - 00:04:36.230, Speaker A: Hold up life and then you give me nothing and you let me just keep I because I know your heart you know your heart hold up you much else are you ready for phase one? I just want I just want to keep you it's I just want you no other reason I just want like, you know, race.
00:05:24.210 - 00:05:26.886, Speaker D: Believe it's ladies and.
00:05:26.908 - 00:05:29.654, Speaker C: Gentlemen the opening ceremony is beginning in.
00:05:29.692 - 00:05:32.210, Speaker D: 1 minute in the Revolution main stage.
00:05:32.290 - 00:05:35.030, Speaker E: Please come into the Revolution main stage.
00:06:15.370 - 00:07:38.330, Speaker A: Of you make my life really? Yeah, like a computer. Don't need a friend. Don't need please, I leave me. Please. Just walk away. You can walk away. You can walk away on the WiFi.
00:07:38.330 - 00:07:40.060, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:07:41.710 - 00:07:42.754, Speaker B: Very fast.
00:07:42.912 - 00:09:48.970, Speaker A: But they can tell. And again. Don't. Leave me just like Jesus. I don't like, um straight. Lay it for me. Download.
00:09:48.970 - 00:10:03.034, Speaker A: Give me that coco. I'm like, oh, no. You doing it all right. You find me like flashlight. You take till I all night. All night for you. So wavy.
00:10:03.034 - 00:10:24.370, Speaker A: Wavy. And I'm finishing. I take me for you. Take me home. Take me home. Don't. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
00:10:24.370 - 00:10:44.570, Speaker A: Like I don't know anybody. You must.
00:10:44.720 - 00:10:45.226, Speaker B: Yeah, I think.
00:10:45.248 - 00:12:45.218, Speaker A: That's all you gotta straight late when we download when you give me that coco I drop me that photo I'm like oh no, you doing it all right there ain't was same instructions how.
00:12:45.224 - 00:12:46.420, Speaker B: Would they give you a free.
00:12:51.990 - 00:14:17.900, Speaker A: Hello, pally. Did and your flights already bring everything quicker they'll give you a micro. Don't know yeah.
00:14:22.870 - 00:14:23.810, Speaker B: Saturday.
00:14:24.790 - 00:14:26.450, Speaker C: Now we have to go into Boston.
00:14:31.190 - 00:14:34.500, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:14:39.750 - 00:17:14.740, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect. And, um I gotta go easy gonna be yeah.
00:17:31.250 - 00:17:49.394, Speaker E: Okay, we are ready to rock and roll. So let's do it like this. Clap once if you can hear me. Clap three times if you can hear me. Clap five times if you can hear.
00:17:49.432 - 00:17:50.020, Speaker A: Me.
00:17:51.750 - 00:18:15.900, Speaker E: I was going to do prime numbers but I forgot two was a prime and one is not a prime I messed up any case, welcome to East Boston woohoo thank you all for being here, we are very excited to be here. So my name is Reese Slinmark, we are in Harvard right now, but I work for MIT and therefore yeah, exactly.
00:18:16.350 - 00:18:18.822, Speaker F: And this is I'm Kartik from ETH Global.
00:18:18.886 - 00:18:49.122, Speaker E: Yeah and we are going to be here to kind of give you an overview in these opening ceremonies over the weekend. You're going to do a lot of hacking and workshops and there's going to be food and sleep and all kinds of good things and right now we just want to give you an overview on what ETH global is and Karthik will talk about that in a second. We're going to dive into some of the sponsors and kind of what they're up to and then do a couple of keynotes about Ethereum and the future of ETH 2.0 and scaling and things like that. So let's kick things off with Kartik.
00:18:49.186 - 00:19:16.234, Speaker F: Thanks, Reese. So I want to do a quick survey by Show of Hands who has been to an It Global event before. That's almost half the room. And the best thing about this survey is that we actually like seeing not a lot of hands up because the goal for Hit Global is to get a lot more developers into this ecosystem. So a lot of you already know what Hit Global is. We actually run events like these all over the world. And our goal is to get more developers kind of testing and experimenting and playing with Ethereum.
00:19:16.234 - 00:19:42.642, Speaker F: And usually we do this in the form of hackathons all over the world. This is our first time in Boston. This is also our 13th event. And the best thing about these events is that they're based on sort of these values that we kind of put on all these events. A lot of these events kind of want you to explore your inner creativity and they make you focus on building what you want. We don't want you to solve particular problems. It's not focused on specific tracks.
00:19:42.642 - 00:20:14.190, Speaker F: It's whatever you want to feel like doing. We want to be able to support that from a technical standpoint, as well as a UX and any sort of other mentorship we believe in showing is more important than telling this is a hackathon. You will be sort of presenting your projects to a lot of judges on Sunday. But the key thing is that it's about showing the progress. So even if something doesn't work, you still get to talk to them about, hey, this is what we wanted to do, this is what we got. It's not the perfect condition, but this is what we have. So it's a lot more about making the actual demo and the code versus a PowerPoint.
00:20:14.190 - 00:20:45.802, Speaker F: This is a place for all of us to learn and mentor each other and learn from each other and sort of grow as developers. A lot of these events have a good mix of tech talks, workshops, people who are super experienced as well as super new to this ecosystem. And this becomes an opportunity for you to learn from each other. Most importantly, this is a hackathon, not a conference. We try to minimize the number of talks that happen over the course of the weekend. We kind of reserve certain sections for talks and workshops so you get to actually focus on building. And this is what we think is a lot more important.
00:20:45.802 - 00:21:09.762, Speaker F: And the best part of it is that all of these things. We do that to increase sort of creativity as well as decrease the feedback loop in this developer ecosystem. This is about making this ecosystem better, and we do that by actually telling others what is and isn't working. So meet Boston. This is our 13th event, and I'm super excited with Reese to tell you.
00:21:09.816 - 00:21:18.790, Speaker E: Oh, my God, it's a lobster corn. Lobsters are from Massachusetts.
00:21:19.130 - 00:21:20.920, Speaker F: I did not sign up for this.
00:21:23.290 - 00:21:32.540, Speaker E: Nice. You can play with them as a sword. Say hi to the lobster corn and woohoo. Hi, Mr. Lobster. Mrs. Or, it whatever you are.
00:21:32.540 - 00:21:51.230, Speaker E: Okay. Can you high five me? Can you see me? Yes, you can. Okay. Enjoy your goodies that you received. There's a special gift inside of there's not anything inside of them. I have no idea what is inside. Yeah, well, thank you, Mr.
00:21:51.230 - 00:21:55.490, Speaker E: Or, Mrs. Lobster Corn, and goodbye and maybe see you later this weekend.
00:21:58.870 - 00:21:59.620, Speaker C: Cool.
00:22:02.870 - 00:22:41.946, Speaker E: So here at East Boston, there are 400 attendees, one lobster corn that did not make it on the slide. Of the attendees that are here, 21% of you said that you're advanced, that you've done a lot of coding with Ethereum before. 46% of you, almost half of you said that you're intermediate. And then a lot of you, 21% are beginners, and 13 are just totally new to ethereum. So that's kind of what you all look like here. And we really have attendees from all corners of the world. So, of course, we are in the United States of America, so a lot of us are from the USA, 66%, but 15% are here from Asia, the Middle East, Africa.
00:22:41.946 - 00:22:59.334, Speaker E: 8% from Europe, 6% from Canada, 4% from Latin America. Let me just get a cheer if you came here from more than an hour away. So cheer if you're more than an hour away. Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you for coming.
00:22:59.334 - 00:23:08.726, Speaker E: I biked here, and I will bike home tonight. And with that, I think that we have Kartik to chat a little bit.
00:23:08.748 - 00:23:47.874, Speaker F: More about the sponsorship on the attendees and the hackers. But we also have over 20 companies here as sponsors and mentors, and they're offering over $65,000 in prizes, so that's going to be amazing. And you can see all of that on Dev post and kind of go on the ETH Boston website to check out. We also have over 23 workshops where you get to actually learn how to use a handful of APIs and protocols and SDKs and a lot more kind of workshops for people who are need ethereum. And then 22 tech talks that are mostly going to be happening tomorrow afternoon. Covering a lot of research and implementation and just topics in the space. With that, we have mentors who are experts in D Five, privacy, UX scaling, and gaming.
00:23:47.874 - 00:24:21.150, Speaker F: So if you're building anything in any of these categories, there's a lot of people that you can talk to and learn from and get help from. So we also have a handful of sponsors that we would like to come invite up on stage and they're going to just come on and talk about what they've done, who they are, kind of why they're here and sort of anything that they can help you out with. So I'm going to start calling a handful of you up on stage. If you are a sponsor, please just kind of line up here on my left and we'll kind of get started. So the first up I'd like to call up TF from Texa.
00:24:25.890 - 00:24:26.640, Speaker A: Hello.
00:24:28.690 - 00:24:55.654, Speaker G: Hackers. I'm the co founder of Texa network. We are building a layer two smart contract platform. So I will start to describe the problem we are solving using one question. Suppose one day the public blockchains have 1 million transaction per second scalability. Does this necessarily mean we can build more meaningful applications on it? Well, not necessarily. There are a lot of other factors other than scalability affecting the usability of blockchains.
00:24:55.654 - 00:25:33.842, Speaker G: For example, time and space resources. As long as smart contracts on layer one are very simple programs, very simple logics, the time and space are strictly limited due to the consensus mechanism. Your gas will soon be drained if you try to delay more time. And also 35 block and also the response latency. That's all because of consensus mechanism and also the functionalities are limited to basic scripting and crypto. That is mostly because of the consistency requirement. And also the nature of applications on public blockchain today are more about information transparency.
00:25:33.842 - 00:26:21.250, Speaker G: Stuff like token economy or collision games. I know this is not a very fair comparison between decentralized and centralized, but it does shows the cost of trust and even the most popular games in the world, they are not information transparency like Texas Holden or StarCraft. They are information asymmetric. And I would like to say that the application build purely on layer one is kind of anti application. That means some features are just not very suitable to be implemented on layer one. So we propose a layered architecture for the future D apps. That is we put the high performance and privacy preserving business logics off chain.
00:26:21.250 - 00:26:58.382, Speaker G: Well, we only use layer one blockchains to put the immutable and persistent states. Just like when you are building a centralized service, you will not implement everything using SQL language on database. You will have a backend and you detach the business logic and the final states. And that's also our philosophy. Only when you need to put something final will you need to generate blockchain transaction. Okay, let me begin with a very simple hot world application called a millionaire problem. You may already heard of it, that is two millionaires.
00:26:58.382 - 00:27:47.454, Speaker G: They want to compare who is richer without revealing their actual wealth. And it's a very abstract problem for trusted computing and secure multiparty computation. And the solution Texan Network uses is trusted execution environment te. We'll discuss later in our workshops. And basically all the layer two smart contract entrance is from a UIL which is multi hash and compatible with IPFS. And both parties will submit a request including encrypted data, and even the computation provider will not be able to see your privacy. And also we migrated the entire Python interpreter environment inside the trusted execution environment, you can see there is UIL mapping.
00:27:47.454 - 00:28:16.220, Speaker G: You can handle each request using different functions and you can take a request and output your result using response. Basically it looks very similar to a traditional backend service, but the only difference is we are also trustless. You can always guarantee the server is executing the code you desired and you can always guarantee the service provider will not be able to see your privacy. And you can always guarantee we are giving the correct result.
00:28:17.950 - 00:28:19.290, Speaker F: 30 seconds.
00:28:20.030 - 00:28:37.860, Speaker G: Okay. And if you can make a millionaire problem, you can basically make some interesting games such as Blackjack or even Texas Holden and you can even bet money with it. How do we generate a layer one transactions from layer two? So we support something called transaction authentication token which allows you to sign.
00:28:39.750 - 00:28:40.066, Speaker B: To.
00:28:40.088 - 00:29:13.806, Speaker G: Authorize the transaction in layer two. And it's more like a commit reveal protocol we'll introduce later in the workshop. And you can build a lot of interesting things with privacy confidentiality. And we also support a lot of third party libraries from Python. And for today's hackathon, we suggest you to make something like games, especially those with information asymmetry. And also you can build something interesting like exchange your contact list to find your mutual friend without revealing each other's. Exactly.
00:29:13.806 - 00:29:55.290, Speaker G: Contact. So a lot of applications with performance and privacy issues that you'll be able to solve on Texa network. And yeah, at last I want to say that the vision of Web Three will not be realized if we only have static storage and the very simple information transparent smart contract. There's another cornerstone which is dynamic service applications on web3. It's very needed for the vision of Web Three and that is what we envision and that is the goal of text and network. And you are welcome to hack with us today. And you are also very welcome to hack with us in the future.
00:29:55.290 - 00:29:59.900, Speaker G: And please join our discord for more information. Thank you.
00:30:01.790 - 00:30:02.314, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:30:02.352 - 00:30:09.310, Speaker F: Chatsa next up we have Jack from Scale. Please welcome Jack.
00:30:13.670 - 00:30:14.420, Speaker B: Hello.
00:30:15.110 - 00:30:51.034, Speaker H: All right, so who's hacking this weekend? All right, awesome. So Scale is happy to be here and to provide support. Let's get right to bounties. Okay, so with two lines of code you can deploy to Scale, run subsecond block times, use decentralized storage and more, which I'll get to in a minute. But we have two 1000 I winners we'll be awarding this weekend and 4500 eye winners. Okay, we've had a great time this year. There's already been 31 submissions at ETH hackathons this year.
00:30:51.034 - 00:31:24.226, Speaker H: I would recommend going to dev post and sort by scale. You can see some of the cool things built, a lot of awesome things where we're seeing smart contracts execute quickly and seeing high throughput. So please check it out. So how do you win? Okay, so first off, who here is familiar with scale? Okay, some people. All right, well, we make it really easy for you to run your smart contracts and do transactions connected to Ethereum in a scale chain. So one way we do this is with smart contracts. It's essentially a side chain.
00:31:24.226 - 00:31:54.874, Speaker H: It's an elastic side chain. And in two lines of code, you can deploy your smart contract to the scale chain. The second way is through interchange messaging, you can design your side chain to work back and forth with a main net and run Etherc 27, 21 and die. So we'll be talking about that later tonight. You can run storage. So without using IPFS, you can use a scale chain to do decentralized storage. Lastly, and sorry, the slides a little messed up, I think, as I get ported to Google Docs.
00:31:54.874 - 00:32:25.414, Speaker H: But you can run machine learning in a scale smart contract. So this is new. We just rolled this out. You can take pre trained TensorFlow models and move them into EVM and do price prediction, fraud detection, image recognition. We'll be talking about this later. So lastly, let's go here. I don't have time to go through the scale network, but what I want to do is welcome all of you to come to our booth and learn about how we use randomness rotation and incentives to let you deploy securely to a scale chain.
00:32:25.414 - 00:33:04.934, Speaker H: It's very different than a traditional side chain. We can also talk about how microservices and containers are leveraged within each scale node. But lastly, and we could talk about how there's enterprise configuration components built into the scale architecture so you can deploy resources to your liking. But the best way to learn about how scale works is well, first, let me ask you, has anyone ever seen a workshop play? Probably a few people. Okay, so Chadwick and Christine at 10:00 P.m., they're going to be putting on a workshop, but in a play format. So it'll be fun.
00:33:04.934 - 00:33:10.540, Speaker H: We're going to build some digital cakes and you'll see how you can deploy to scale. Okay, thanks, everybody.
00:33:12.910 - 00:33:19.130, Speaker F: Thanks, Chuck. Next up, we have tech from Binance X. Please welcome Tech on stage.
00:33:21.970 - 00:33:22.334, Speaker A: Hey.
00:33:22.372 - 00:33:23.338, Speaker C: Thank you, Cardik.
00:33:23.434 - 00:33:52.466, Speaker I: How many of you have heard of Binance X? Oh, wow. Impressive. This was just launched last week, so either you're lying or you actually know about it. So let me give you a quick overview of what is Binance X. So we're a new initiative that is formed to foster innovation on the binance platform and general ecosystem at large. So we're not just funding stuff on things that are built on the binance platform. We're happy to fund stuff outside the ecosystem.
00:33:52.466 - 00:34:14.222, Speaker I: We're exchanged with 400 something pairs. So we like to see stuff happen outside our ecosystem as well. So what is the binance platform? So we've grown over time, over the past two plus years, to have all these products, all these developer facing products. So we acquired Trust last year. We launched the binance. Dex. We of course have the centralizedexchange.com
00:34:14.222 - 00:35:00.682, Speaker I: with the APIs. And then we also launched a binance charity, which has most people don't know that we have a way to track last mile donations using the blockchain. So when we launched X, we thought about how we want to engage developer, and we thought about from the developer's perspective, what they want to do when they come to a platform. So they want to learn how to build a platform. They want to interact and collaborate with their fellow developers, and then they want to get support from Binance, the platform provider. So we kind of organize our stuff or activities around those three things. The first one to learn where we organize documentation, you aggregate all documentation or binance stuff into one place, and we participate offline stuff like bootcamps and hackathons like this.
00:35:00.682 - 00:35:50.330, Speaker I: And we want to expand the community of binance and blockchain developers in general. And then we want to kind of enable you guys to collaborate and kind of work together. So on the website we have forums and job boards and RFPs. We actually BEP's Binance Evolution proposal, which is like the EIP equivalent for the binance chain, which is community proposals for how to improve the binance chain. We already have some of these working groups, we have rip on the website, so this will be very relevant for this hackathon. We have some Skunkworks projects which I couldn't talk about yet. And we have an evangelist program which is just launched to kind of have people at universities mostly to kind of help us reach out to developers in those communities.
00:35:50.330 - 00:36:11.582, Speaker I: So the last part is how we support developers. So we have a bunch of programs, some of which you might have heard of. Binance X has a fellowship program. I know some fellows are here. How many fellows are here? I know at least two. One, okay. The rest of fellows are not in this audience.
00:36:11.582 - 00:36:58.034, Speaker I: But it is an open source grants program where we give out grant free money to support open source development in blockchain space. The idea there is we want to see more building blocks in the ecosystem that people can use to put together more blockchain service or apps. We have about 40 fellows, 40 fellowship projects, and about 50 to 60 fellows in this program already since we launched about April this year. You can check them out on our website. People like Austin Griffith is a binance fella. There's Hamad over there who is a binance fella. A few other people you might know, of course, Launchpad is our IO platform, which you might already be familiar with.
00:36:58.034 - 00:37:30.940, Speaker I: And then Binance Labs is our investment arm where we do direct investments into projects. And then of course, internally we have partnership groups and then strategic investment and M A teams that look at things that are very strategic to us or things that are mutually beneficial to both the project and Binance itself. And we'll come up with other preferred deval programs. Over. So we have a newsletter we're going to put out every two weeks. And this is the URL, the Telegram group. Actually, we also have a mailing list that you can sign up for on the website.
00:37:30.940 - 00:38:10.422, Speaker I: Just t me Binancexnewsletter if you want to take a photo of it or visit the booth and then we'll tell you the URL. So, Ethboston prizes, we're going to basically give out fellowship grants for basically just generic best apps or services to leverage the Binance platform. It's very open. You don't necessarily have to build stuff on an RFP. RFP, there are two RFPs we have on the website. One is RFP for the Binance chain, and then there's RFP for the Africa initiative. We have a Uganda Exchange, and then there's a bunch of other projects.
00:38:10.422 - 00:38:49.272, Speaker I: We're trying to build stuff for Africa Continent for African use cases. So there's a bunch of stuff there as well. But we're open to any idea, especially ideas that you think is useful for other developers or useful that could get traction with the user community. Yeah, this is the RFP. You can easily find it on our website, which is Binancex dev. And I'm doing a workshop tomorrow morning right after breakfast in this room, B 108. I'll talk more about in detail, more about what building on the DAX and.com
00:38:49.272 - 00:38:55.610, Speaker I: APIs and Trustwallet entail. So come by if you're interested. Thank you.
00:38:57.100 - 00:39:01.820, Speaker F: Thanks, Zach. Next up we have Dan from IDEO.
00:39:05.920 - 00:39:06.380, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:39:06.450 - 00:39:06.780, Speaker C: Okay.
00:39:06.850 - 00:39:33.460, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Dan. I'm with IDEO. For those of you who aren't aware, IDEO is a 40 year old design firm. I'm from the IDEO Colab team, which is a small team with an IDEO that is largely focused on crypto. So IDEO is all about having these multidisciplinary teams. We got known for designing the original Apple mouse. There's like a shopping cart video of IDEO reinventing the shopping cart, that's really popular.
00:39:33.460 - 00:40:20.470, Speaker D: But really what IDEO is known for is developing this field of human centered design. So one of our founders, David Kelly, also started the Stanford D School. And we think that really, it's important to start with thinking about the desirability of anything you're building. For any venture to be successful, you need to have this intersection of desirability, viability and feasibility. And I think often in this community we focus very heavily on is this technically feasible? And we kind of leave the other two circles till a little bit later. We're really pushing to get more people to start thinking about users early on. So IDEO today works with a wide range of very large global companies.
00:40:20.470 - 00:41:25.912, Speaker D: But our team is focused again very specifically on crypto, on decentralized web and blockchain applications. So we have recently launched a startup studio for blockchain entrepreneurs. And let's see, we've been investing and building in this space since 2015. But this startup studio that we recently launched, you can think of it like an accelerator program, but unbundled. So rather than having a cohort or class of companies that comes in, we have this series of half day and day long events that are focused on very specific things such as how to do proper user testing, how to work through product validation, how to do hiring for designers, how to scale an organization. And we have a long list of partners that we work with in various ways, a bunch of VC mentors from some top firms in the industry. And there is no cost for startups to participate in this program.
00:41:25.912 - 00:41:55.884, Speaker D: We're pretty selective in terms of how we go through and select people to participate, but we don't ask for any equity. There's no charge. This is our way of helping to push the community forward. And so we're hopeful that some of the projects that get built here this weekend, should you decide to go forward and pursue turning them into ventures, that you will come and talk to us about ways that we can help you do that and move forward together. So check out a little bit more about the program@ideacollab.com startup Studio. We've got a table.
00:41:55.884 - 00:42:34.620, Speaker D: I'll be giving a talk tomorrow morning about how you can try to get more users into your application and retain them by getting them to that magic moment a little faster. Also, for those of you who may be students or kind of freelancers in between things, we're going to be having a makeathon, which is kind of IDEO's version of a hackathon. There's an application that's out there right now. Applications are due by September 15. Come to the table. There's some information out there it's a chance to come for. If you come to the makeathon and you get selected, you're invited to a two week paid fellowship in January.
00:42:34.620 - 00:42:41.570, Speaker D: And then there's also a longer summer fellowship that you'd be eligible for as well. So thanks and come find me.
00:42:44.920 - 00:42:52.340, Speaker F: Thanks so much, Dan. That's super cool, actually. Next up, we have Alex from Squarelink. Please welcome Alex.
00:42:56.220 - 00:43:39.440, Speaker E: Hey, guys. Who wants me to skip all of my slides and go straight to the bounties? You idiots. That was an empty promise. How do I use this? Okay, so what is squarelink? Squarelink is an end to end onboarding solution for DApps to attract mainstream users into your applications. So basically, we provide a standard web3 provider. You can integrate it into your application as easily as if you were integrating MetaMask. At the end of the day, once you integrate Squarelink into your application, all of your users will be able to register, log in, sign transactions, sign messages, even recover their account just using an email and password.
00:43:39.440 - 00:44:10.936, Speaker E: And we still keep everything completely noncustodial, so just decided to keep it short and sweet. We'll go straight to the bounties. So for the team who has the most innovative use case for Squarelink, we're offering 2500 in ETH. For the best user experience, 500 in ETH. And for the team that has the most complete integration, another 500 in ETH. And for that last one, be sure to check out our documentation. There's like a lot more functionality outside of our standard Web Three provider, so tons of stuff you can do with Squarelink.
00:44:10.936 - 00:44:45.880, Speaker E: So check it out. Now the main event. So if you look at the top left hand corner, you'll see we actually only have one engineer and he's actually kind of attractive. So I guess on that note, we're hiring like crazy. DevOps, full stack, front end support, QA. So if you're interested at all, we'll be hosting interviews throughout the event. So just schedule an interview on my calendar.
00:44:45.880 - 00:44:51.550, Speaker E: Come say hi to us. We'll be at our booth 24/7. Yeah, cool.
00:44:54.880 - 00:45:04.476, Speaker F: Thanks, Alex. And our last sponsor on stage, please welcome Sam from Thundercore. Thank you.
00:45:04.658 - 00:45:08.864, Speaker C: Now, I have no slides, so I'm not even going to have to say.
00:45:08.902 - 00:45:10.428, Speaker I: Hey, if we want to skip all the slides.
00:45:10.524 - 00:45:16.188, Speaker C: It's just that it's just Thundercore. So I'm Sam from Thundercore. Clap if you've heard of Thundercore.
00:45:16.364 - 00:45:18.308, Speaker F: Oh, I was a little worried that.
00:45:18.314 - 00:45:19.750, Speaker I: Was not going to turn out well.
00:45:20.120 - 00:45:31.416, Speaker C: So thundercore is a blockchain. We focus ideally on two main improvements over a lot of other blockchains out there. Number one, our transactions. We're clocked regularly at 1200 transactions per.
00:45:31.438 - 00:45:32.408, Speaker F: Second, which is great.
00:45:32.494 - 00:45:36.692, Speaker C: And the second thing is our confirmation finality time subsecond.
00:45:36.756 - 00:45:37.896, Speaker E: So that means that if you were.
00:45:37.918 - 00:46:04.790, Speaker C: Using our platform, if you're using our stuff, you could actually have an experience, much like Venmo. I actually ran an experiment up at Trufflecon about a month ago where I was giving out TT Dai, our equivalent stablecoin to Dai to people, and would do a garage sale experience. It was pretty awesome. So that's who we are now. We have a booth out there. You can come by, say hi, get some T shirts, get some hats. I see a hat in the audience, so thank you for wearing that.
00:46:04.790 - 00:46:06.404, Speaker C: And then if you have any questions.
00:46:06.442 - 00:46:07.616, Speaker E: About us or what we do, don't.
00:46:07.648 - 00:46:08.884, Speaker C: Hesitate to let me know.
00:46:09.002 - 00:46:09.716, Speaker G: Thank you very much.
00:46:09.738 - 00:46:10.900, Speaker C: That's Thundercore.
00:46:14.920 - 00:46:55.584, Speaker E: Okay, thank you so much. So in addition to those sponsors we have, and really, I just want to emphasize this, like these sponsors, they make the event happen. You're going to get free food all over the weekend, the venue, all of the bounties and prizes, a lot of stuff. So I'm going to say all the sponsors, but there are a lot, as Kartik mentioned, so hold your applause until the end and then we'll give them a big round. Of applause. Okay, so the sponsors are so we have scale and newscypher and Thundercore and squarelink and IDEAco lab and taxa and off chain labs. And, uma, we have Algorand oasis Labs.
00:46:55.584 - 00:47:14.452, Speaker E: Myether wallet, aka. Mew. Enigma consensus coinbase taurus ENS seller. We got Quorum, which is the one that doesn't have any words. Accomplice. I did that beforehand. Quorum accomplice provable Aztec binance x rivet abridged foam.
00:47:14.452 - 00:47:37.120, Speaker E: And we have our partners, which are like, people that do this for all of the ETH global events, kind of not just Boston. And that's ethereum foundation matic provable UNICEF scale thundercore ENS taurus Zero X consensus offchain labs news cipher and the Bounties network. I think that's all. Yeah. Let's go back. Okay, so give them all a round of applause.
00:47:43.220 - 00:47:44.550, Speaker F: You want to press next?
00:47:48.840 - 00:47:49.590, Speaker B: So.
00:47:51.800 - 00:48:34.740, Speaker F: This is fine. Albert's going to come up in a second. Ethereum actually is one of these sort of innovations that's kind of come up in a long time that actually excited a lot of people. And the potential for what it can be is kind of super vast, which kind of gets us into this situation where we don't really know what the best use case is or what the best thing you can do with this and just in general, measure what the potential or the possible sort of things that we can leverage this technology is. So to kind of share some of thoughts on what the potential of Ethereum itself could be, I want to call Albert Nee from the Ethereum Foundation to the stage. Please welcome them. Albert.
00:48:41.320 - 00:48:43.030, Speaker C: I can use that too. It's fine.
00:48:43.720 - 00:48:44.276, Speaker B: Cool.
00:48:44.378 - 00:49:11.660, Speaker C: All right, 1 second. Awesome. Thanks, everyone, for coming. So we're in a college town, decided to do a bit of a tribute to my college experience, and we're going to do a bit of, like, a fire hose survey. We're going to go really, really fast through a bunch of different ways to look at Ethereum. Not going to be able to spend as much time as I'd like to on most of these topics, but hopefully give you some interesting food for thought and would love to talk more about each of these things later. So, first, one quick.
00:49:11.660 - 00:49:54.796, Speaker C: Not super important, but just brief intro myself, studied math and CS pretty close to here at MIT back in the day, live in San Francisco. I had a fun experience real early at a company called Dropbox. Learned a lot there, did some other stuff afterward and been helping the Ethereum Foundation for the past couple of years. So, like I said, with today's talk, we're going to go through a bunch of different perspectives. But before even diving into the specific perspectives, why is this important? I think one of the reasons it's important is when you have a complex topic, it's valuable to take different perspectives to try to better understand it. And if you think it's like, oh, no, it's not going to be that hard to understand this. Well, I decided to dig up some fun quotes from about 20 some years ago.
00:49:54.796 - 00:50:31.812, Speaker C: First we have ironically, the inventor of ethernet has nothing to do with ethereum, but it did have a lot to do with the internet. So it's kind of interesting to see a quote from the inventor of ethernet about the internet. Here's something about, yeah, retraining 250,000,000 people. Who's ever going to do that for the internet? This one's a bit longer, but it's basically like, my local mall is doing more business than the entire internet, like, blah, blah, blah. And I almost felt bad including this. He's gotten a lot of crap for this. But Paul Krugman's infamous quote, I do want to be clear, I'm not trying to compare blockchain or ethereum to the internet.
00:50:31.812 - 00:51:03.472, Speaker C: That alone would be the exact opposite of, I think what we should be doing. Actually, what I'm trying to get at is a lot of you have probably heard of the parable of the blind men and the elephant. And the idea is like, these different blind men touch different parts of an elephant. They all have incomplete and incorrect views on what they're touching. And if you think about trying to predict the future or see where things are going, it's kind of analogous to this. So that's why I decided to try to take this multi perspective angle. And the first one is just history.
00:51:03.472 - 00:51:40.344, Speaker C: As saying often goes, history doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. And started with a quote from just a couple of weeks, or maybe it's like two months ago now from biology on twitter. But yeah, I think looking at the past is often just as fascinating as trying to think about what the future can be. And so one thing I thought about recently was imagine being there for typing on a keyboard and seeing letters appear on the screen for the first time. Obviously this is natural to us today, but imagine being there for that first moment. Well, when I thought about it, I was like, actually, probably a lot of people didn't care. Probably a lot of people were like, we can already do this with a typewriter.
00:51:40.344 - 00:52:19.760, Speaker C: What's the big deal? And if you think through even just moving data around, many people in this room are probably too young to have used many, if any, of the first few things here. But there's been quite an evolution through the years for the way people move things around. I remember my family was not well off. The one thing that we would invest very heavily in was technology. And my parents talk about how when I was two, they spent $600 to buy a 20 megabyte hard drive for the first computer that I had as a kid. So I was really fortunate that they cared enough to do that. But you just think about that for a moment.
00:52:19.760 - 00:53:00.196, Speaker C: I mean, it's still better than storing stuff on ethereum, right? Now, but it's a lot of money for not very much stuff. Another thing I think is interesting when you take a historical perspective is you have this imitation thing that goes on. And as they say, imitation is this sincerest form of flattery, and it gets even more interesting when the imitation doesn't make any sense. So one of my favorite throwback examples is how JavaScript was originally named Mocha, and it was renamed to JavaScript because Java totally separate language, works very differently, was extremely popular at the time. They're like, all right, yeah, we're just going to name it JavaScript now. It's the most used programming language in the world. So kind of like an interesting parallel here.
00:53:00.196 - 00:53:32.656, Speaker C: You have Solidity, which as many of you may know, it's one of the ways you can write contracts on Ethereum. It's used to interface with the Ethereum virtual machine. Syntax was motivated a lot by JavaScript because of JavaScript's popularity. Even though I think coding and Solidity is probably better thought of as like, writing bash scripts, you probably don't want to take a front end developer kind of mindset when building stuff on Ethereum. Not that stops a lot of people, but hey, that's where we're at. And just as a fun fact, even the creator of JavaScript works on the Brave browser. It's actually a great browser if you haven't tried it.
00:53:32.656 - 00:54:05.788, Speaker C: You don't need a blockchain to be using the browser, but it was funded by a token issued on Ethereum. So, like I said, history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. Along those lines. There's this performance optimization rhyme throughout history. I'm just going to go a little bit more quickly here, but in 2005 when I started MIT, I remember there was this kind of like contrarian narrative that performance optimization wasn't going to matter anymore. Kind of made sense at the time. Like, computers just kept getting faster and faster, and it's like, yeah, you could performance optimize, but you could also make things more readable or more accessible in other ways.
00:54:05.788 - 00:54:38.432, Speaker C: Are you even going to need to optimize things that much in another ten years? Of course, then the smartphone revolution came along and all of a sudden everyone had this slow computer with even slower Internet, and performance optimization started to matter again. And now we've got blockchain computing. It's like basically going all the way back to the beginning. It's pretty much punch card computing or mainframe computing. So now the second perspective I'm going to take is an engineer's perspective. One thing that I found really fascinating over the last 15 years is how much software engineering has changed. I remember talking to somebody about building stuff on Ethereum.
00:54:38.432 - 00:55:20.820, Speaker C: A really bright kid, wonderful person, but was like, how could you possibly write code and then put it on this blockchain and you're not going to be able to change it afterwards? That just seems impossible. And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess you probably have never used a CDROM, right? How do you think when people issued software on CDROMs, how are they going to update it back then? And it's because the software engineering companies today have become much more safe environments, which is great. It's made software engineering a lot more accessible. On the other hand, blockchain engineering, it's kind of like going from the city to the jungle. It's an unsafe coding environment. And one of the reasons for this is because computing on blockchain is you're sort of imposing some laws of physical reality onto the virtual world. It's like why you can have scarcity, for instance.
00:55:20.820 - 00:56:01.264, Speaker C: And so I often note that I'm not sure thinking about writing software on Ethereum should be thought of as software engineering. It's kind of more like building hardware than software. And along those lines, I am confident and I am optimistic about the future of blockchain based systems because we can build cars, we can build bridges, skyscrapers, space shuttles. I think we can build systems that are complex yet reliable on blockchain as well. But we're going to have to use very different best practices than the ones that we're using today. The third perspective is the research perspective. So blockchains are often considered inefficient, but they're actually very efficient at what they fundamentally do.
00:56:01.264 - 00:56:43.912, Speaker C: They allow a lot of distinct, just like nodes or entities to come to probabilistic consensus about something. You don't need to know everyone else in the network. You don't need to be connected to everyone. When I was taking distributed algorithms at MIT, you were like working with 50 nodes and you were assuming they were all on the same network and all this other stuff. And now you can have 10,000 and more nodes coming to consensus with very high probability using a lot of the principles that power blockchains. It's just that when you try to then do more stuff on top of this, there's these other factors that make them a lot less efficient. And what another thing that I think is interesting is from a research perspective, well, cryptography, as many of you know, it uses computational hardness as its fundamental building block.
00:56:43.912 - 00:57:36.764, Speaker C: Like, the fact that it's hard to do certain things is actually good because that's what allows us to have cryptography and build things on top of it. And crypto economics, which is kind of what blockchains bring into the equation, they bring in this economic component which essentially gives you more knobs and dials to work with. It uses this economic or incentive based or game theoretical hardness as its fundamental building block in addition to using cryptography and other things like that. And so just overall, I found it fascinating that in an ethereum or blockchain context I've run into some of the things that I really never thought I'd see again after college, after I decided I wasn't going to, I don't know, be like a math PhD or whatever. Quick examples would be like fermat's little theorem or just like any abstract algebra. Never thought I'd see any of that again, zero knowledge proofs. I would bring them up at parties because I thought it made me sound cool but actually probably had the opposite effect.
00:57:36.764 - 00:58:30.268, Speaker C: It's like, hey, you know, you can like there's this thing called a zero knowledge proof and if know, put this ball behind my back and do this stuff and people are like what are you talking about? And then even just Professor Ron Revest who I saw last May at this VDF Day event that I can talk more about if you grab me later on. So it's been cool that blockchain Ethereum has brought some of these things back into my life. And overall ethereum and other blockchain systems have just done a lot to stimulate cryptography and zero knowledge proof research and development as well as just distributed systems and consensus and stuff like that. And so moving along, we've got the computing stack perspective, right? When I think about the most interesting technical environments I've been in, a seminal experience for me was when I was twelve, I built a computer. Well I mean I didn't really build it, I just bought a bunch of parts. It was an excuse as a school project, get my parents to pay for all this stuff. But I bought a bunch of parts, I plugged them together.
00:58:30.268 - 00:58:58.644, Speaker C: You had to make sure everything fit like a tower and all that. And it always left me with this memory like yeah, computer is a thing you can take apart. A computer is a thing that has pieces and each of those pieces themselves can then be taken apart. And that always stuck with me even when I worked at Dropbox. What I thought was interesting was I never really had to go that deep into the stack. And Dropbox is already a fairly complex software engineering system by modern standards. It has a desktop app which very few products have nowadays.
00:58:58.644 - 00:59:37.088, Speaker C: It had extremely high correctness requirements and even then we were really barely moving outside of this fairly narrow slice of the computing stack. Now when I look at blockchain based computing it's really cool to see this opportunity and need to reinvent the entire computing stack. I mean it's one thing to be like, I'm going to write a programming language and no one's going to use your new programming language nowadays unless it comes with a new context in which it might be especially useful. And so just like smartphones were a new context and a lot of new programming languages and paradigms emerge out of that. You might see something like that in blockchain. And similarly the entire developer experience. I mentioned cars and bridges and skyscrapers.
00:59:37.088 - 01:00:48.284, Speaker C: I like to tell people I would not want to drive across a bridge that was built in JavaScript and so we're probably going to have to do a lot more work on that front as well. And overall I just think this is the first time in literally decades that so many parts of the computing stack are simultaneously accessible to be worked on in a practical context. I've thought a lot about, hey, what have it been like to be part of the early days of the internet or operating systems or even just computers themselves? And I feel really fortunate because in some ways it's like being present for all of those at the same time, just in this new context. So moving in a different direction for a moment, this legal or game theoretical perspective, one thing that the blockchain and work, just being in a blockchain environment has really helped me understand better is what is the purpose, for instance, of the legal system. I used to think like, oh, the legal system exists to enforce laws, but now I realize it actually exists in part to create society wide confidence that laws will be enforced. And having the society wide confidence shifts the equilibrium of how people behave at scale. This is what's interesting.
01:00:48.284 - 01:01:27.080, Speaker C: When you have a big group of people that think differently about something, it then has these other macro effects on how they're likely to act. And so one of the things I think is still underrated about blockchains is I'm not sure this is totally possible yet, but we're moving in direction where you can have these anonymous credible commitments for meaningful things. There would have been an oxymoron even ten years ago. We would have achieved it by using some sort of mutually trusted third party. But overall we're seeing this new primitive. And when you have new primitives, it creates new equilibria for new behavior. What kind of behavior? Like still really early, but it's an exciting prospect.
01:01:27.080 - 01:02:20.820, Speaker C: A lot of you probably aware of the Prisoners Dilemma. If you don't know what it is, I don't have time to go into it here, but I definitely recommend Googling and just reading about it, it's one of the most fascinating things. And one thing that I always try to remind people is the Prisoner's Dilemma actually is solvable. It's just not directly solvable in particular, you either have to change the payout matrix, which involves some sort of communication, or maybe even deeper commitment, or you have to turn the Prisoner's Dilemma into an Iterated game, in which case it becomes a lot more favorable even if the one shot game is unfavorable. And so again, by having this new type of language that can be built around guarantees instead of promises. I don't know if this is actually going to come through, but I've heard people talk about this don't be evil versus can't be evil thing and hopefully we'll be able to see innovations that can lead to that. So the last major perspective is that of talent.
01:02:20.820 - 01:02:48.176, Speaker C: This is a pretty bold statement, but I really think the amount of technical talent in blockchain is going to go up a lot. And the reason for this is because of a few concepts. First, top technical talent always wants to work with other top technical talent. I mean this one I think is a pretty easy one to understand. But another thing to keep in mind is that top technical talent rarely looks for new opportunities. They're happy where they are. They're usually working on interesting stuff and appreciated where they are and things like that.
01:02:48.176 - 01:03:33.230, Speaker C: And so if you really want to understand what might be coming along, you don't want to ask people what they're doing or look at what they're doing. You want to say if you were looking for a change, which I know you're not, what would you consider? And so counterintuitively top talent is actually a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator. That's something that's really important to keep in mind. And with that when you see one respected peer become interested in a topic that's worth more than 1000 days of hype and news cycle. So I think back to when I joined Dropbox back in 2008, it's like pretty motley crew, right? And people were like, what's a startup thing? That's weird. You should be going to grad school, you should be going to finance, you should go work at Microsoft, whatever. And not too many years later founders like on the COVID of Forbes and people are like, oh, this startup thing is actually kind of interesting.
01:03:33.230 - 01:04:15.868, Speaker C: By 2016 it's like it's almost weird if you're not interested in startups. So came along pretty quickly. So since I think the blockchain based computing is just the most interesting environment that not just software engineers, but economists, cryptographers, lawyers, probably even multilevel marketers have encountered in a long time, it's just a gravity well for different types of people. And when more of these people come together, who knows what's going to come out of it. So my closing thoughts, like I said, who knows what's going to come out of it, right? It's not that clear that Ethereum is only going to be a part of solutions problems. I think it's quite possible. It's also going to cause a lot of problems whether it's Ethereum or other just like programmable blockchain systems.
01:04:15.868 - 01:05:02.504, Speaker C: So that's something that we just constantly have to keep in mind. Again, trying to look into the future, this blind men and the elephant thing all over again. It's important I think, for all of us to stay humble and just continue to think about what it is that we're missing. What is it that we're not seeing as we kind of move into this new frontier? So as my final quick perspective, remember what I said about how a lot of people don't care? Probably didn't care the first time. It's like, so what? There's this computer terminal thing but what do you even do with this computer thing? Who even cares about that? And I think that's something important also for everyone here to keep in mind, which is almost everyone who's interested in Ethereum or Blockchain stuff today, they've crossed essentially this intellectual chasm. But the mainstream doesn't care. For the mainstream to actually interface with Blockchains, we're going to have to cross a usefulness chasm.
01:05:02.504 - 01:05:36.100, Speaker C: And so, in this sense, blockchain is very different than Facebook or the Internet or whatever, where you can be like, oh, look at the growth numbers. Well, the first 10,000 people on Facebook I know because I was one of them, were doing basically the same things that the 10,000,000th person on Facebook was doing. They were just like looking at each other's photos and posting on each other's walls or whatever. But the first 10,000 blockchain people essentially had some sort of like, acid trip epiphany type thing about the world. And the 10,000,000th blockchain user is probably not even going to know that they're using a blockchain. So we're going to have to cross this usefulness chasm. That's why it's awesome to be at a hackathon.
01:05:36.260 - 01:05:36.536, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:36.558 - 01:05:43.900, Speaker C: And hopefully, as we look at Ethereum in 2019, as we keep building and growing together, we'll see a very different Ethereum five years from now.
01:05:43.970 - 01:05:45.070, Speaker G: So. Thank you.
01:05:48.960 - 01:05:49.624, Speaker C: Woohoo.
01:05:49.672 - 01:06:32.524, Speaker E: Thank you, Albert. And I guess I just want to note as well for Albert, I mean, he does a lot of just behind the scenes work within the Ethereum Foundation and it's a lot of work to operate a decentralized network of people and I think he's done a good job. So with that, that's kind of a very wide take on kind of the future of Ethereum and how it connects to the Internet and those kinds of things. And what we want to do now is kind of dive more deeply into Ethereum specifically and some of the technical, scalability challenges that Ethereum is dealing with and how we're going to go through them. And so to do that, I want to welcome Raul Jordan to the stage. Raul is from Prismatic Labs. He's a protocol developer and he is building the future of Ethereum 2.0
01:06:32.524 - 01:06:35.660, Speaker E: and he went to Harvard in 2017. So let's welcome Raul to the stage.
01:06:41.760 - 01:07:01.376, Speaker B: Awesome. So I know we said the numbers are maybe like 25% or 21% of people are new to Ethereum or kind of relatively beginner, but can we get a quick show of hands? Just curious, who is pretty new to Ethereum? What do you say? Don't be shy. Awesome. Great. Awesome. Great to have you all here and it's a pleasure being here. Fantastic talk, Albert.
01:07:01.376 - 01:07:49.060, Speaker B: Those really awesome points. I would love to just go into a little bit more in depth as to kind of where we've come, how crypto can win and if crypto wins, why did it win? If it loses, why did it lose, and where we're headed, how we're going to get there concretely and efficiently. I'm an Ethereum protocol developer, co founder of Prismatic Labs. We're working on an Ethereum 2.0 implementation that basically is going to be a radical upgrade that's going to increase the scalability of the platform, make it more massively accessible to the public, have a better, more robust security model called Proof of Stake as well. So this is our team, so most of us are here and please come find us after. I mean, we'd love to chat, love to tell you about some of the challenges we've encountered and where we're headed.
01:07:49.060 - 01:09:05.484, Speaker B: Yeah. When I actually first started learning and had that magic moment with computers was actually the first week of September, around six years ago, just across the street at a little place called Sanders Theater, in a class called CS 50 here at Harvard, where they showed us this really cool diagram of what the Internet is going to look like in the future. They had this really awesome kind of perspective of having all these different packets of data coming all across the world and it just really felt like something that was just truly decentralized, truly accessible to people who wanted to interface with this network. Coming to the conclusion that over the next few years I would encounter the Internet is very far off from that initial promise that was given to us and have been since trying to find something that could get us closer to that goal. As such, I discovered ethereum. And why should we care about Ethereum today? Why is this something that we should build on at the moment? To give a little bit quick background, I want to talk a little bit about kind of where we are today with respect to surveillance dates and kind of how this comes into relevance. I remember in high school checking out 1984 from the library, having it recommended, having it been like this cool little Sci-Fi thing.
01:09:05.484 - 01:10:02.300, Speaker B: It felt really, really, you know, really far off from reality. I'm originally from Honduras in a country that has very little access to technology. And imagining this sort of, you know, big Brother is always watching you sort of thing, imagining the concept of double think, having the own citizens really question the nature of the reality and kind of accept the doctrine and the dogma of this world felt super alien to me, in a sense. Main questions going through my head are how can the people that live in this society ever have allowed this to happen? How did these governments even coalesce into this shape and form? And what led them to be in this current state? And really the answer to me was extremely unclear. Humans are super multifaceted organisms. We have so many different incentives and oftentimes irrational perspectives on life. And really, I think one of the oldest and most important human emotions is fear.
01:10:02.300 - 01:10:55.724, Speaker B: And really fear of safety, maintaining people safe, perhaps sacrificing something in the name of the common good and why that matters. So we've all been familiar with the concept of things like Amazon, Go. We've all used Venmo to some extent. And it's funny to browse through and see what some of the funny things our friends are spending on. But really at what cost does it come? Is this really just a small it? Is it just something that we should trivially care about? Or does this have a deeper and perhaps a more sinister tone than it seems? Say the most common argument is, hey, I'm a law abiding citizen. Why should I care? Or why does this really even matter? To me is kind of like the serious tone of it more like a slippery slope. Well, today we see so many stores completely going cashless.
01:10:55.724 - 01:11:56.928, Speaker B: In fact, people say that if cash were invented today, it would probably be illegal. Right? In the future we're actually going to go cardless and in the future you might have your transaction being rejected because you are not really authorized to purchase a book. And this is the sort of reality that kind of gets us closer to that Sci-Fi perspective. And the thing is that at the end of the day, the people in charge are really doing this to fit some sort of narrative of protecting the common good, protecting the daily average life of a law abiding citizen. Why should they matter? This is fitting into a common narrative. Problem with this is when institutions decide to sacrifice individual freedoms for a common narrative and for the common good, their definition of this is what truly makes a difference and can be extremely, extremely dangerous. For the first time, and I want to really echo this, is we have the capability of creating, how Albert said, these anonymous yet credible systems that don't depend on human trust as a primitive.
01:11:56.928 - 01:13:03.320, Speaker B: In reality, every piece of technology that we built, we build with assumptions. Assumptions, technical assumptions, societal assumptions, philosophical assumptions. One of the biggest ones that we create every time we write a piece of software is that there is some sort of aspect of trust, some sort of anchor that prevents this technology from being kind of misused and has some sort of built in protections that protects both the end users and the party that created such technology by default. This sort of property and this assumption is something we can throw out when we build something like so actually this slogan was actually not coined by Blockstack. It was actually originally from an old post on a Chris Dixon Twitter thread where he's essentially echoing the same point. Instead of just reinforcing the assumption that we should not just push forward that narrative, that we should just not abuse our power, we want to build systems that just cannot have participants abusing their power by default. And I think that's a very powerful concept.
01:13:03.320 - 01:13:42.052, Speaker B: So Ethereum's early experiments, when Ethereum was first conceived, it really had no plans of what you can build on it. If some of you recall the old website for Ethereum, it had some really cool examples like, hey, make a dow. Or like. Make an escrow contract, settle a sports bet with your friend, right? But at the end of the day, one of the things that really resounded upon me from reading the old Ethereum website as well is that they mentioned, hey, we have no features. Ethereum is an open network. We don't care what you build, even if it is a literal pyramid scheme like FOMO 3D. Right? And I think that's powerful, right? So of course technology is a tool.
01:13:42.052 - 01:14:17.890, Speaker B: It will be used for good and for evil. But one of the most important things is that it gives us option. And option is something that is being seen as more of a luxury as time goes on and as our society becomes more and more evolved into the surveillance Sci-Fi nation state. So we've come a pretty long way, to say the least. The oldest Ethereum wallets would completely sacrifice a lot of UX in the sense of having a very strong sense of security. You would basically be running a fully validating node just to be able to access your accounts and be able to transact with each other. This is super cool, but in reality not really what most users needed.
01:14:17.890 - 01:15:10.156, Speaker B: Essentially. Now we have applications where you don't even know that you're using a blockchain. So if you look at things like Gods Unchained which is a fully collectible card game, kind of like Heartstone, these cards are ERC 20 tokens on Ethereum. We now have things like Metamass Mobile where you can actually open a CDP just from your phone and I want to give a shout out also to Portis, which is also a really cool platform where you can go on a website without even having to access or download an extension and immediately log in and be able to start using it. Additionally, today is probably one of the most interesting times because we've had so much progress in things like Tornado Mixer. So these are tools that allow you to actually mix your coins with other participants and further decouple your financial sovereignty from your identity. Aside from that, we have Aztec Protocol which is doing some really awesome stuff on zero knowledge proof.
01:15:10.156 - 01:15:51.208, Speaker B: So you can essentially send fully private transactions, just further pushing this notion that hey, you're in control here of your funds and this is what Ethereum allows you to do. And these things are actually live on mainnet. So yeah, please go check them out. We actually now have an incredible set of financial building blocks that we couldn't even have dreamed of a few years ago. Right? We have things like Dai that's been so incredible throughout this whole journey. We have things like Dharma that allow you to just lever instadap as a single dashboard that allows you to control and see access to all the things that you control in this financial ecosystem. Aside from that, we do have the tools to onboard the next 100,000 developers.
01:15:51.208 - 01:16:51.360, Speaker B: They're right there and the technical challenges are real and there are awesome peers to work with and learn from on this journey. However, let's take a look about how we can tip the scales a little bit further. So if crypto wins, how did we get there? And likewise, if it goes the wrong way, then what happened? What led it to be that way? Truly believe that for Ethereum to succeed, we must build applications that really enrich and improve the daily user's life through ways that abstract away the blockchain itself. We must provide an essential product and I really want to highlight essential that provides something that cannot be done by centralized services. And we want to ride a paradigm that this is an unstoppable borderless trustless technology that is a public good for the world. When we say public good, it's open to everyone, right? Whether you want to use it for good and evil, that's what matters. There are options out there and I think it's one of the most critical aspects that we must retain in this society.
01:16:51.360 - 01:17:58.040, Speaker B: So it is pretty easy to imagine a world in which Ethereum wins if that world is crypto native, and that's extremely not the case today. A lot of the things that you can immediately come up with as use cases for blockchain depend on kind of this assumption that everyone is kind of participating in this open network. How do you get them involved in this network? How do you even bootstrap and kickstart this onramp? Still has a massive roadblock and a massive way to go for adoption and a massive privacy hurdle to overcome as well. On the flip side, if we lose, then what happened, right? It's a few things. So if we consider the hypothetical scenario in which surveillance states kind of draconian laws kind of rapidly outpace the rate of innovation in privacy technologies that we see in blockchain such as Ethereum, we can see that as a massive detrimental factor towards a lot of new developers or people coming into the space. An interesting thought experiment is to think like, can total criminalization of ownership go crypto? Although this might be going a little bit too far at that point. You're basically forbidding citizens from owning a bunch of numbers, which are your private keys.
01:17:58.040 - 01:18:49.080, Speaker B: Can this really basically destroy kind of this grassroots community? Right? And I would argue not. It might have actually the counterintuitive effect. But another thing is if tribalism overtakes crypto, as in any community, there are disagreements, there are own agendas, there are different ideas that people push forward if we fail to acknowledge our similarities and focus more on our differences. I think this is one thing that can hamper collaboration and prevent us from getting up to speed and kind of going past that hockey stick curve that we see on the previous slides. So where is Ethereum itself headed? And what is ethereum 2.0? What does that look like? And this winding road is very much on purpose, right? I mean, we're navigating this idea maze of what's to come. There are a lot more questions that come up.
01:18:49.080 - 01:19:25.680, Speaker B: As you ask a question, ten more pop up, right? So you have obviously big challenges ahead. A lot of great folks here have solved a lot of different scalability challenges around Ethereum using things like Layer Two. But at the end of the day layer one still has a fundamental problem of capacity. We burn a lot of extremely unnecessary energy just to power these networks. That could be done in other ways. And additionally, we still do not have very satisfactory solutions that make the proper compromises at the Layer One scale. So to quote my co founder scale or die.
01:19:25.680 - 01:19:58.648, Speaker B: So basically the idea behind this quote is that we want to get to the point where Ethereum wins. But in reality, if we're not true to ourselves if this technology does not scale to where it needs to be then it dies. And I think we have a very strong responsibility to get it there. We have a few ideas here for those a little bit unfamiliar with. Kind of like the scaling strategies towards ETH and ETH One. The basic idea, most naive solution, I guess is just to imagine oh, let's just increase the block gas limit. Let's pack more transactions into blocks.
01:19:58.648 - 01:20:20.532, Speaker B: This means that each node will require a lot more computational power. And obviously it's one of those things where you're just pushing the problem a little bit further down. You're not really addressing the root cause. Makes it obviously less decentralized. Another one is you can reduce the time between blocks, right? I mean, that sounds great. Faster confirmation times. You have all these cool benefits that come along with that.
01:20:20.532 - 01:20:59.552, Speaker B: The very big problem is obviously this makes a blockchain more vulnerable to forks and attacks. Blocks have to propagate across the network and when you have a network like Ethereum, that is permissionless. So anyone across the know there could be somebody in Australia running a node. There can be somebody from here, from this room running a node. You have to understand that these things have to propagate in real time through the network understand how that's going to affect the system and the integrity if you do such a strategy. So that's obviously a less secure strategy. The thing we're pursuing in Ethereum is actually this idea called sharding which is idea when you take a data set and you partition it into different pieces and you can achieve a higher computational throughput by parallelizing this.
01:20:59.552 - 01:21:45.330, Speaker B: So in Ethereum today we maintain the state. Every single node kind of is a fully validating node. So they maintain the entire state of the chain from genesis and basically validate every transaction to make sure that they're caught up with the rest of the network and participate in a consensus protocol. In Ethereum 2.0 in particular, nodes are not going to be fully validating nodes. Instead, we're going to be partitioning the state across the network and making it so that the consensus algorithm is clever enough that it's able to reconcile this and be able to securely and efficiently determine the state of the world with a new capacity. Typically this gives you some special type of scaling and there's a different type of even crazier scaling called super quadratic sharding which is a little bit far off kind of Sci-Fi stuff.
01:21:45.330 - 01:22:32.700, Speaker B: So scalability really. What does it mean? At the end of the day, it's the ability for software to kind of respond in the way it's intended to no matter at what scale and without fail. And I think that's something that we really need to really need to keep in mind. Next generation blockchains, as you may have heard of. You've probably heard about things like DEFINITY EOS and there are a few other ideas out there kind of that fundamentally redefine a lot of the key aspects of what layer one does and what its responsibilities are in a blockchain ecosystem. In particular, a lot of these sacrifice things such as decentralization for higher throughput they provide kind of a stronger kind of cryptographic assumption towards consensus. And I think what Ethereum is trying to do and what Ethereum 2.0
01:22:32.700 - 01:23:06.356, Speaker B: really is doing is it's trying to find really the most sensible and the most honest approach to solving this problem. Ethereum 2.0 is trying to maintain a high degree of decentralization, a high degree of security and also a high degree of speed by being able to just find the compromises between those things, take the best of all different worlds and really learn from each other. Put aside the differences between the different chains and really understand how we can push this forward. So in Ethereum 2.0 we have this thing called proof of stake and that's going to be a radical change. It's essentially going to change the consensus algorithm.
01:23:06.356 - 01:23:46.032, Speaker B: Instead of having to run these really expensive machines that kind of burn a lot of electricity and power just to be able to verify transactions across the network, you're going to be able to just lock up some of your money, some of your ether earn interest on that and essentially, basically get penalized if you do something that's provably malicious against the network. This is a fundamentally different security model. It's based around penalties rather than rewards and makes the system a lot more robust against a lot of scenarios. So Ethereum has actually always been keeping proof of stake in the back of its mind since the beginning. And in Ethereum 2.0 we're actually making this a reality. Aside from that, one of the major things that gets talked about a lot is WebAssembly.
01:23:46.032 - 01:24:35.232, Speaker B: So many of you have been coding in the solidity programming language which is particular to Ethereum and how it started and it lets you do some really cool stuff. It's a very nice kind of domain specific language that's evolved over the years. With WebAssembly, we're taking a lot of cool technologies that allow us to use a lot of different programming languages that we're more familiar with, such as things like Rust and C Plus Plus, and be able to use them in blockchain programming environments. Granted, not everyone might want to be programming smart contract in C Plus Plus, but this gives us a very strong kind of primitive in which we can bring different kind of development communities to really build on this technology in a transformational way. Aside from that, one thing Ethereum 2.0 is going to bring is we're going to have actually the ability to create unbiaseable distributed randomness. For those of you that are quite unfamiliar, creating randomness in a blockchain environment is near impossible.
01:24:35.232 - 01:25:09.904, Speaker B: It's extremely difficult to do. So today you can do things like use the block hashes as a random seed in your application, but really, that's not random. For something to be random, you want it to be unbiasable. You want it to kind of exist independently of manipulation of actors in the system. So we do some really cool stuff around verifiable delay functions and using this information to create an unbiasable blockchain. So if you're curious about this, please come talk to me afterwards. Yeah.
01:25:09.904 - 01:25:48.424, Speaker B: So with my team, we're building an Ethereum client called Prism. Just like today, when you run an Ethereum node, you run a Go Ethereum node or a parity node to sync up with the chain. When you run the next iteration of Ethereum, we imagine people will be using Prism as their go to client. This is a way you can actually sync up to the chain, verify blocks, participate as a validator, and kind of do everything you would need to do to interact with the environment of the blockchain. There are currently eight teams or more implementing Ethereum 20 related features or clients, and this is arguably one of the best times for E 2.0 and kind of its future. Next week, the teams are gathering in Toronto for an interoperability meeting.
01:25:48.424 - 01:26:29.988, Speaker B: That means that they're actually getting their clients together, communicating via network, and putting together a multi client testnet. And that's a major milestone akin to some of the first ETH 1.0 testnets that came out there since the beginning. And next month, we're all going to Osaka, Japan to go to the DevCon Five Conference, which is one of the biggest Ethereum related conferences in the world, and really just really crank out more MultiClient interoperability features there. And Mainet early 2020. So we're going to be pretty busy out there, but I believe the work will be really worth it. So if there's any words of advice for those of you that are kind of new to the hackathon, is just really pay little attention to the hype.
01:26:29.988 - 01:27:14.730, Speaker B: I think coming to so many ETH global events, like seeing just how much depth of information and how many motivated people there are to build on these things is what's really exciting. And at the end of the day, all of you here are tinkerers. And when we look at new technologies, what we should do is that we should always find those people that are tinkering on the fringes, that are always working on things, keeping their heads down independently, thinking about why this matters, over following something like a Hype train. And I think we're at a fantastic moment in Ethereum where everyone kind of that's in this room truly cares about what this can bring for the world. And I think it's our responsibility to get it there. So, yeah, so please check us out for Prismatic Labs and thank you so much.
01:27:20.460 - 01:27:56.432, Speaker E: Thank you, Raul. And one note on this, by the way, is that it's really cool that you can build, as we saw from all the sponsors earlier, you can build at the application layer and try to build all these applications. Or you can talk with folks like Raul and start to understand the protocol layer here and start to tinker with and experiment with that this weekend. So before you leave, I'm going to do five quick minutes of logistics for this weekend. So let's start it. The first note is where's the Wi Fi? So it's on your badge. If you look on your badge and you look at the back, it's on the back of your badge.
01:27:56.432 - 01:28:15.580, Speaker E: And just note that there is the unique code there and you should use that. That's how you get on the WiFi. And once you're on the WiFi, by the way, please spread the event. Either mention at Ethboston on Twitter or use the hashtag Ethbostin. Take pictures of people, hang out, do whatever. We have a question in the back. What's up? Actually a comment.
01:28:16.400 - 01:28:18.728, Speaker H: Your username should be eight digits.
01:28:18.904 - 01:28:20.748, Speaker B: If it is seven digits, put a.
01:28:20.754 - 01:28:21.820, Speaker H: Zero at the front.
01:28:21.970 - 01:28:37.200, Speaker E: Nice. Thank you for that help. To repeat that to the audience, your username should be eight digits. Mine is eight digits. But if it's seven digits, put a zero in the front and then it will work. So that's how you get on the WiFi. The other note here is to join the discord.
01:28:37.200 - 01:29:07.980, Speaker E: And so if you go to Ethboston chat, you can do this. And this is where all of the information will happen. So announcements about talks, announcements about closing ceremonies, all the mentors are there too. So we're going to have a bunch of the East Boston mentors who know a lot about solidity programming and things like that. They're going to be on there all the time. And in fact, there's even a mentor there scheduled even in the deep hours of the night. So all the time you should be able to ask the mentor channel on there, hey, I need some help.
01:29:07.980 - 01:29:31.476, Speaker E: And all the sponsors are there too. So if you're building on top of a bounty or something like that, get on the discord. So let's say being on the discord is like a very crucial piece of this. So go to ETH Bostonchat, join the discard cord and everybody will be there. And so food there are food trucks upstairs. I think they close tonight at 01:00 A.m. Is what I heard.
01:29:31.476 - 01:30:05.016, Speaker E: And then they'll open up tomorrow and the food is all free and it's cool food trucks. And so go upstairs, eat that all weekend, today, tomorrow and Sunday, to understand all the things that are happening. There's a schedule on ETH Boston. And just note that there's this room and there are two other rooms and there's sponsor Talks. Don't think of them as sponsor Talks. They are sponsors that come and other people that come and just help you code and help you code and help you build on top of their protocol. So that's all weekend.
01:30:05.016 - 01:30:32.916, Speaker E: And I also want to note that there are other kind of fun things happening. Like in that section of this building, there's this thing called Nick's Corner, which is like a place to play video games and hang out and eat snacks and stuff. So like weird kind of fun things like that are happening. I think there might be like a massage thing set up. So just be on the lookout for these things and really check the schedule to understand what's happening. Let me say one other note there's. Like right after this talk, there will be someone speaking in this room and someone maybe, I think, speaking in one of those other rooms.
01:30:32.916 - 01:30:52.168, Speaker E: So check the schedule. ETH Boston. If you want to make money, this is where you find it. This is where all the sponsor prizes and bounties are. So this is Ethbostin Devpost.com. And Devpost is going to be this is going to be your place where you're going to submit everything. This is the place where you can see all the bounties, all the prizes.
01:30:52.168 - 01:31:18.116, Speaker E: So go here. And also, as a note, if you don't want to make money, that's fine too. You can go and code your own thing or whatever, but this is where you can see all those bounties and prizes. Also if you're brand new to Ethereum. So one of the big tracks of the content that's happening, there's like a big content thing. If you go to the website, you can see like the Ed thing. It's all tomorrow from 09:30 A.m
01:31:18.116 - 01:31:59.056, Speaker E: to 04:00 P.m.. There's a whole track of just a full intro to solidity and how to program and the integrated development environment that you need and all those kinds of things tomorrow from 09:30 A.m. To 04:00 P.m.. One other note here is, yeah, we appreciate being able to use this space, so please keep it beautiful. It's a hackathon. So definitely stay up late and drink coffee and try to do all of your fun coding, hanging out with people, going to workshops, but try to keep it nice. Clean up after yourself, and if you have any issues with anything, any questions, any comments, whatever, there's the help desk at the front, near the stairs.
01:31:59.056 - 01:32:19.684, Speaker E: So just go there and let us know. If you have any feedback or thoughts or questions, visit us at the help desk. There another note here is I guess the key point here is we have a code of conduct. You can see it@ethglobal.com rules, but the key thing is just to be respectful to each other. We're all here to have a good time. People have different perspectives.
01:32:19.684 - 01:32:35.256, Speaker E: And really, I mean, harassment and abuse are not tolerated. If we feel like someone, we don't expect this to happen. I don't think this has really happened before at an ETH global event, but if someone is being bad, we'll kick them out. I will personally do so. So with that, is there any other notes?
01:32:35.288 - 01:32:50.160, Speaker F: Cart one last thing. If you are still looking for a team as a hacker, there is a team building session just right after this in 60 seconds in the Minute Man Room, which is the room right across this. So if you're still looking for a teammate or an idea to work on, you can meet in the Minute Man Room.
