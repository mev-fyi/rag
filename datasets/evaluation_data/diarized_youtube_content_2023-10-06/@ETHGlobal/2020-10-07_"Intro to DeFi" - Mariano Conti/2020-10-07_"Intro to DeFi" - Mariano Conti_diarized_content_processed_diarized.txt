00:00:00.890 - 00:00:30.550, Speaker A: Talking about our next talk. And the next talk we have planned is actually a talk by our very own Mariano Conti, who is going to be covering a very high level and also some depth about DeFi and what's going on right now in the space. And he's going to just cover a handful of things about this. And for those of you who don't know, mariano was previously at MakerDAO and is over all a great guy. So I'll let Mariano take it from here. Welcome, Mariano.
00:00:31.930 - 00:01:11.778, Speaker B: Hi. Thank you so much for having me. Okay, let's get this. I'm really, really excited to be here. I'm a friend of ETH Global and I've been to a bunch of hackathons and participated in the last ETH Online and really excited to be in this one as well. So this is Intro to DFI, and let me say a little bit about me. Been around Ethereum since 15, was in Maker up until last month.
00:01:11.778 - 00:01:59.186, Speaker B: Did everything from Oracle Smart contracts to helping out with PSI and Dai. I'm currently a retired farmer and DeFi historian of sorts and maybe working on something new. We'll see about that. Today. I want to talk about what is DeFi, why we DeFi, a brief history of it as I see it and as I've experienced it, and also a little bit of what is next or what I hope comes next. And it's going to feel a little bit like this. I'm usually the old guy surrounded by young people.
00:01:59.186 - 00:02:39.790, Speaker B: I actually enjoy it. All of you keep me young, keep me curious. So please continue to do that. And if you enjoy this kind of conversations, we can always have them. This is really why I'm in this space and what I enjoy the most. So to me, decentralized finance is, in short, taking control of your own financial destiny in a trustless and permissionless way. I've been living on DFI since 2015, 2016.
00:02:39.790 - 00:03:34.130, Speaker B: It works across borders. It's uncensorable, and most importantly, it's on Ethereum. I am very adamant with this. What everybody has created on the Ethereum blockchain is unparalleled. And while we may end up seeing some bridges and some level two solutions, I don't expect or I hope that the main financial system of the future, decentralized is going to live on the Ethereum blockchain. Let me tell you why we DeFi or why I DeFi. I've talked about this many times living in Argentina.
00:03:34.130 - 00:04:18.366, Speaker B: It may be different than why you use decentralized finance, but I use it to escape crappy economy and lousy government and capital controls. I gave a talk at DevCon last year, October 2019. I just looked up the Argentine peso was around 65 pesos to a dollar. Today, it's 147 to 150 pesos to a dollar. And you can see the Mortal Kombat image on the right. The dollar just obliterating the two peso bill. The five, the ten, the 20, the 50.
00:04:18.366 - 00:05:31.586, Speaker B: And now it's between the 100 and the 200 and this is akin to what our brothers and sisters in Venezuela go through and in other places. And decentralized finance gives a lot of people an edge to escape this kind of thing. And the beautiful thing is that before it used to be mostly people in tech, right? Engineers, those who got into bitcoin early then Ethereum. But slowly we've been building UIs abstractions that allow a lot of people to have access to the systems. For example, here we have a restriction that nobody can buy more than $200 legally in banks per month. This has been going on for a while and this also drove a lot of people in Argentina to use dai. And having to use dai sometimes meant using uniswap.
00:05:31.586 - 00:06:27.570, Speaker B: And a couple of weeks ago or last week when the uniswap AirDrop happened, that was like a UBI for a year. For a lot of people here, I think it's truly absolutely magical. What is know there's a lot of things that we can do and like I said, it depends on where you are and what your economic status is. But there are plenty of reasons to use decentralized finance. The ones that I care about the most tend to be more to the equalizing societies. It is not the only one and it is not the only valid one. I always say it is fine to make money to speculate, I'm not against open markets, it is not what interests me the most.
00:06:27.570 - 00:07:10.690, Speaker B: But if that's why you're in DeFi then it's a total, completely valid reason and I'm not going to say anything about that. But some of the reasons about it you can earn salaries in stable currencies. That to me has been life changing and to many people that I know, of course a big one. Attractive interest on your capital. We've all seen those memes where banks say oh, we've reduced your APY to 0.1% one and we laugh at that, right? Of course there are risks involved. We can get instant loans without going to a bank.
00:07:10.690 - 00:08:03.030, Speaker B: I bought my car with a CDP back in the day. We get access to new financial services, we can speculate on finance and much, much more. Now, I do want to talk this is a brief history of DeFi from ICOs to yield farmers. I want to give an overview, as I see it of what got us into where we are today. And I want to start with 2016 because Ethereum Mainet launched in 2015. But really if we want to talk about D five proper, I think we can start with 2015 aka five BC, which is of course before Crony. There wasn't much in 2016.
00:08:03.030 - 00:08:45.720, Speaker B: I got this from a Tweet today. This was ether delta. It was probably the first decentralized along with maker Market decentralized order book exchange and there wasn't much more that you could do there. There were a few tokens, you could buy them and sell them and it looked like it was good enough for the time. And truly it was. Of course, we got the Dow that can or cannot be characterized as DeFi. Maybe the early beginnings, we had Ether Delta, but there were hints of what was coming in the future.
00:08:45.720 - 00:09:23.726, Speaker B: So if we go to 2017, aka four BC, we start seeing projects either released to testnet or to Mainnet. Maker released the size stablecoin. At the end of 2017, we had Digix Auger was around, of course, not on Main Net. And sure, we got the age of ICOs. Right. I wanted to share because I just saw it this morning as well. This is the original Sci dashboard.
00:09:23.726 - 00:09:58.758, Speaker B: It was crude, but it showed you everything you needed to know about the system. It took a while to load, but there was no handholding. Right. This is DeFi. Do you want to get a loan in a stable coin? You need to put ether in there and figure out how to do it. But if you managed to do it, it was magical. You could put in your Ether, the native token of ethereum, and get a decentralized stablecoin back that was pegged to the US dollar.
00:09:58.758 - 00:11:02.510, Speaker B: And there were markets around that you could easily start to trade this. And with the launch of Stablecoins inside, we saw the initial boom of decentralized finance, because now we have a stable unit of exchange. And to me at least, and I'm extremely biased, as you know, but to me at least, this was the actual birth and what paved the way to the rest of DFI as we know it. So what did we get in 2017? Of course we got many ICOs, but we got Maker CDPs, which were loans, we got the site Stable coins, we got a few hints of Dows, and I'm going to miss a whole bunch of projects in this presentation. I apologize. This is a brief history. If you want to know a lot more, please read Cammie's book.
00:11:02.510 - 00:11:49.534, Speaker B: She's going to be on in a while. We had a lot of projects on testnet and we did start to see some early adoption. But what we didn't have yet was DeFi's biggest strength, which was Interoperability, right? The ability to take things from different projects and having them work together. And that's what we got. In 2018, or three BC, we started seeing projects like dYdX. Compound Ave was ETH Len back then, Uniswap at the end of 2018. Uniswap is not even two years old, but this is what Uniswap used to look like.
00:11:49.534 - 00:12:47.330, Speaker B: I couldn't find an earlier version. I believe this is probably one of the first. But we got the ability to long and short tokens. With dYdX, we had the beginnings of money markets. With Compound, we had token swaps. But the best thing about everything is that we started seeing projects that used all of these things together to create new things. And that is what gave birth in 2019 or two BC to a Cambrian explosion of projects and also stablecoins, right? But 2019 was when the community, and I don't know if it was also what everybody called the crypto winter, we were past that crazy bull and everybody went back to work.
00:12:47.330 - 00:13:03.314, Speaker B: But there was a lot of things to work on. You didn't need to start from scratch anymore. You needed a stable coin, you could get it. You needed a money market. There were a couple available. You needed to do anything. You didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
00:13:03.314 - 00:13:55.560, Speaker B: You could just reuse permissionlessly other projects. We started seeing more. We saw the rise of synthetics and Nexus Mutual. We saw other tokens from other blockchains starting to appear on Ethereum WBTC. We saw the initial money robots in said protocol. I think 2019 was the moment when we saw that DFI, at least for me, could really be up to something. We saw the rise of Molok, February 2019 that gave birth to MetaCartel and all of this investment dows, designer Dows, personal dows, any type of dow, which to me are very much DFI as well.
00:13:55.560 - 00:15:06.282, Speaker B: And now we get to early 2020 or one before Crony. And if 2019 was a Cambridge explosion of projects, 2020 was the camber and explosion of total value locked, right? That was probably the three letters that I've seen the most this year. It's an obsession to see how much capital people can put into a project and just going, oh, there's $500 million worth in DFI locked. Now there's a billion. And then starting mid year, we saw that doubling every month or so or every couple of months. We saw the rise of new project, curb balancer, yearn finance, Open and others. And most of this projects, as you can see, their main benefit is that they have a base layer, but they also communicate a lot with other projects.
00:15:06.282 - 00:16:46.462, Speaker B: Curve, of course, being an AMM of stablecoins with the popular white pool that used Ave in the background to earn yield balancer. It's a base protocol. But there are smart pools running on top of it and of course, yearn finance, which created most of what we've seen for the past couple of months. So what did we get here? We got better token swaps, we got uniswap D Two, we got smart token pools, we got the ability to exercise options with Open, and we got the search for better yields and yield farming, something that began with Synthetics mostly, then compound with the comp token, and it completely exploded with urine. Right? So I think we also need to stop and talk about the past couple of months and the search for yield urine finance and the Wi Fi token changed the game for good, in my opinion. It not only created a radical new way of launching governance tokens, it showed that you could have a project first, revenue first and then a token later. It revolutionized the concept of a fair launch, which was a big thing for about three weeks.
00:16:46.462 - 00:17:46.420, Speaker B: And now I think we're back to some percent VC, some percent team instead of 100% fair launch. I don't know which one is fair, which one is not. This is not judging, but it also shows how changing this ecosystem is. After WiFi, everything was a fair launch for three or four weeks, and then it wasn't. Maybe next week it will be again. And it paved the way for a lot of experiments, some really good, in my opinion, like Yam, which provided interesting aspects of governance, elastic, supply, treasury, but it also gave way to the food tokens, right? We got the kimchi, the noodles, the spring rolls, we got many rock pools. These past few months have been interesting, to say the least.
00:17:46.420 - 00:18:47.190, Speaker B: They have been risky, they have been a lot of fun if you manage to make some money. They haven't been fun if you manage to lose money, but they have been sobering, right? I think we need to really reflect on what has happened and act accordingly. We got the attack of the clones, we got the sushi swaps, the swerves, the percent. There are more to come. There are some that were just blatant copies with no innovation, and there are some that actually do seem to want to expand and not just say, hey, we're X bot fair launch to the community. So there's a lot of interesting things to watch out for with the clones that may end up not being clones at all. So where are we now? October 2 ah 04:34 p.m.
00:18:47.190 - 00:19:25.230, Speaker B: Argentina time. I want to call today one ad, if you will. So one after Djens. We already lived through an intense period and let's try to commit, if we can, to a new era, if you will. This is the morning after. As my friend David said last month, DeFi has been partying hard in the club for hours. Somebody just turned on the lights.
00:19:25.230 - 00:20:03.870, Speaker B: Everybody's sweaty, gross and drunk. Quick, someone turn off the lights. I propose something different. I propose we turn on the lights, we look at each other and we realize that today, now, it's the perfect time to build. We are also at the first day of a new global hackathon, which is the perfect time to realize that, to build something. But this is what I want to impress on you. I think we should do it responsibly.
00:20:03.870 - 00:20:48.490, Speaker B: And well, that's for another slide. Let's not forget the reason why I think we're here. DeFi is a way to take control of your financial destiny in a trustless permissionless way. I believe this should be our ultimate goal. And that's why I want to stay 5 seconds on this live in case you share this mission with me. Look, it's never been easier. I was checking this morning moneylegos studydefi.com.
00:20:48.490 - 00:21:15.998, Speaker B: It's a few lines of code to get a flash loan from dYdX Instant Liquidity, few lines of code to get a flash loan from Ave. Same instant liquidity. You can do it from Uniswap as well. It's a few lines of code to do a token swap using one inch or using Uniswap. It's extremely easy. Now, the foundations are all there. This is getting maker dialogue.
00:21:15.998 - 00:22:06.834, Speaker B: You will forgive us the diwanese, but it's still extremely easy. And the protocol and the foundations are all there. 2020 is unlike anything we've ever seen. The kinds of projects that are already there, you can do a lot just by taking all these pieces and putting them together into something new. So my ask to everyone is I'm urging you to build, but with this for tenants, I want you to build responsibly, disclose, try to get audits, talk about risks. This is still in its infancy. It's a nascent industry.
00:22:06.834 - 00:22:35.002, Speaker B: So please disclose as much as you can. I want you to build intelligently. That means you can reuse all of what people have built before, but also build creatively innovate. Don't just copy everything. There's plenty that you can reuse, but there's plenty that you can add. And finally, I want you to build for scale. And that means thinking about layer twos.
00:22:35.002 - 00:23:33.082, Speaker B: And if we want to give people financial independence, we cannot expect them to pay $5 or $10 for a transaction that may end up being half their salary or more. We need to get creative there and we need to use layer twos. And that's the end of my talk. I realized this ended up being a little bit of an intro to DeFi, then a little bit of history, and then a lot of maybe just me pontificating about things. But I think it is important that we talk about everything that I mentioned. And I want to thank It Global for the invitation and if we have time, I'm around for questions. Thank you very much, Mariano.
00:23:33.226 - 00:24:30.660, Speaker A: Thank you so much for that amazing intro. I think you kind of covered all the recent things that are happening and just kind of your perspective on it and particularly like, the historical perspective you take for the people who are watching this on the chat. Please ask any questions on the chat and there's about a 25 2nd delay. So we'll kind of get your questions back to Mariano soon. But we have a few questions that are up and coming already and I'll start kind of asking them here directly. So the first question we have is, obviously you've been part of DeFi from the start through Maker, and most recently you have really kind of direct perspectives into what's happening for the developers who are working in this space. What do you recommend they do for being able to test how things will work in this connected DeFi world without testing in productions directly? And does that change? Is there a better solution? And kind of how do you think about that moving forward.
00:24:31.830 - 00:25:33.926, Speaker B: Yeah, it is complicated because of course there are so many moving parts that the Itesting prod thing ends up being a necessity sometimes because you need to test what happens in the real world with many different protocols that may not have testnet deployments even on the same testnet. But there are certain things that you can do. You can use Ganache to fork the state of mainnet as it is up to the last block. And then you can simulate transactions. You can do goth mode where you can impersonate any address or you can give yourself any amount of tokens or you can travel to the future. You can advance a few blocks, advance a few seconds, see what happens. Not only Ganache gives you this Dapsis with, HEBM also allows you to test certain things.
00:25:33.926 - 00:26:06.290, Speaker B: It's not going to be 100%. There are certain things that it cannot do. I know the Biddler team, Nomic Labs, they're working on expanding some of this. So I would say look into that. Try to test as much as you can with forks and then if you do need to test on mainnet, try to do it from an account that's not tagged as probably the most watched account on Ethereum.
00:26:08.630 - 00:26:56.500, Speaker A: Subtle. That's great. The other question I have is we took a look at everybody who signed up for this event from not just the hackathon but also the summit side. And there's lots of people from various backgrounds, from kind of traditional enterprise side to startups to people who are not in crypto at all and just want to catch up with it. And obviously the pace DeFi is moving, is super kind of fast and it's just not super easy to keep up. So we're wondering if you were able to sort of just highlight a couple of your current DeFi protocols. Not your favorites, but just kind of give us an overview of how some of these protocols work and maybe we can start with Wi Fi and just kind of give everybody an overview of what it is, how it works, why it's unique or why it's interesting, and maybe something else you would like to pick on.
00:26:57.030 - 00:28:30.538, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So Wi Fi at Wire and Finance, it's mainly a moni robot that looks for yield and tries to give you more money than you put in. So they have this thing called and that is one part but it has been the main part. Let's say you have a stable coin, either DA, USDC, tether true USD or another, or you have ether or you have a token and you supply it to one of the yearn vaults. And what this vault does is it looks for ways to put your assets to work and earn you interest on them. And the way they optimize is that instead of having 100 or 1000 people doing it individually with their money, they pull it together and they act as one big fund and they save on gas and they save on management and that is the basic idea. It's a moni robot that looks to make you more money and the token is just a way to capture governance and some of the treasury that this search for yield gives you and that is the gist of Urine finance.
00:28:30.538 - 00:29:39.654, Speaker B: Other protocols that I use almost every day is I use Maker, Ave and Compound, which are compound and Ave are money markets so you can borrow and supply assets and depending I use it a lot I have different tokens, and maybe I need one to put into another protocol, but I don't want to buy it, and I don't want to sell the ones that I have. So either Compound or avid support the token that I have so I can loan it, I can supply it to the protocol and then I can borrow another token back and I can use that token in another project. And Maker is not exactly a money market, but it's almost the same idea. You supply a token and you create die from it and then you can use that dai to maybe put into one of these protocols to earn some interest on that. Those are the ones that I probably use almost great.
00:29:39.692 - 00:30:40.410, Speaker A: I think a lot of these are actually very kind of common, especially as we look at our hackathon projects. They are currently being utilized a lot in experimentations for DPI. So maybe one other question and we've seen a couple on this theme from the chat, but it definitely merges with the L two side of the equation here. But right now, aside from all of the creative sort of outcomes you can get that beat the traditional financial markets, whether it's better interest rates or just being able to have access to capital without a lot of prerequisites, the gas costs are definitely not sustainable for anybody. You kind of point to Argentina being the perfect audience for this thing. But if the gas costs exceed someone's salary alone, that doesn't help them kind of take advantage of these things fully. So kind of what do you see is like a good way forward towards making these things more accessible or kind of at least amortizing these costs? And what is the right way to think about layer two for DeFi?
00:30:43.310 - 00:32:09.714, Speaker B: Well, I don't want to presume to be an expert, which I'm not, but I've already seen layer twos working right now. Gitcoin grants, they use the secret roll ups and that worked great. You have loop ring right now where you can fund your account once and then do standard token transfers for pennies that exists now. I don't think the problem is just we need further adoption of this. We still don't have the interconnection of protocols on layer two that we have on mainnet, but for certain things like token transfers that exists today and I'm watching closely, optimism and what synthetics has done and they've announced that there's going to be other projects testing as well. And if they can get the projects on optimism, talking to each other, I think that's going to be a huge step forward. But for now, I would say just go straight to what Loop Ring is doing, what Gitcoin did with their grants, the ability to trade tokens on a layer.
00:32:09.714 - 00:32:12.280, Speaker B: Two are live today.
00:32:14.170 - 00:32:41.280, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. Just reading over the next questions that we have, I think maybe one question I have for you personally is, I guess what do you think is currently missing in the world of DeFi? I guess from the perspective of these Lego blocks, like, we got money markets, we got lending, borrowing in general, we now have investing in multiple forms of it. But what do you think is sort of like a thing that's not easy to crack right now and things that you get excited about?
00:32:45.110 - 00:33:55.538, Speaker B: I think I would say, and this is probably a boring answer, but we don't have enough auditors around and security experts. I very much did not like this past couple of months, projects going live and on Twitter, tagging different auditing firms going, hey, would you mind auditing my new project for five Ether? I think that was the wrong approach. If we're going to have so many projects fighting for people's attention and capital, the least that we can do is try to play it safe. And I would urge anybody with knowledge of solidity to if they can. I know that security is like a very specific thing. I'm a smart contract developer and I wouldn't qualify myself as a security expert or even an auditor. I can do certain things, but I would need some more time and expertise.
00:33:55.538 - 00:34:15.600, Speaker B: But if anybody wants to follow that path, I think now and for the years to come, it's going to be extremely lucrative because hopefully we've learned and new projects come out audited. And I know that a lot want to, but there's just not enough people right now to do that.
00:34:16.290 - 00:35:04.240, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think anything we can do as developers to make it easy for everybody to write a bit more safer code is definitely a much needed step, especially when you're letting others play with money. And there's obviously legal implications of all these actions as well. And it gets very wonky super fast as you kind of scale this thing to multiple geographies instantly. So, kind of having just seen how the last few months have played out, I agree with you on how important it is to keep security in mind because you are trusting other people and they're trusting you with their money, and that's personal. So with that, I want to thank Mariano for being part of the Q A and your amazing presentation. I'm sure we'll see you on our discord, collaborating with a lot of hackers and helping them out.
00:35:04.240 - 00:35:06.300, Speaker A: So thanks again and.
