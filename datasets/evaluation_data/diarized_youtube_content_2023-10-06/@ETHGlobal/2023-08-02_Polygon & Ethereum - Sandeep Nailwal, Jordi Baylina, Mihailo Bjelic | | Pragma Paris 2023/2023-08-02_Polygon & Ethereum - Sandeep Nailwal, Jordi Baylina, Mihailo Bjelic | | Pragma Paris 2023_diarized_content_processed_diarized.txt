00:00:07.530 - 00:00:25.640, Speaker A: For this one, I want to bring on three amazing people. They're all co founders of Polygon. We're going to talk about what's been happening in the Polygon ecosystem, how do they think about the alignment with Ethereum ecosystem moving forward and all of the new exciting tech that you can look forward to? So without further ado, please welcome Sandeep, Mihalo and Jordy. On stage it.
00:00:34.090 - 00:00:35.080, Speaker B: Hi everyone.
00:00:35.450 - 00:00:36.520, Speaker A: Hello. Hello.
00:00:36.970 - 00:00:38.438, Speaker B: This mic is very good.
00:00:38.524 - 00:00:39.160, Speaker C: Hello.
00:00:41.130 - 00:01:32.010, Speaker A: So, as we were planning to do this panel, I wanted to think about a different format than let's do one by one. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just say very little prompts and I want you to figure it out and answer things that best represent the collective answer from Polygon. But I'll still make it a little bit fair. I want to have Jordy kick us off with kind of giving an overview of kind of what's been happening in the world of kind of scaling. So Jordy, my kind of question to you is you've been helping scale Ethereum for years and you've been very crucial in the advancements of Zkvms and just ZK tech, and that being production ready. Could you give us an overview of how things got started in this space, what you've been able to do before and after at Polygon? And overall, what's the lay of the land for how Polygon is thinking about Scalability?
00:01:32.830 - 00:02:21.846, Speaker C: Well, when I started in the blockchain 2016, a long time ago, well, I realized that this technology was amazing and you wanted to do a lot of things and a lot of ideas and so on. But the first time that I tried to use seriously in real life, it was for Catalonia events and so on, I realized that this technology just doesn't work. I mean, it's fine, it's cool, it has a lot of promises. But if you want to use it in mainstream, if you want to use it in real applications, it's not ready. It's not ready by far. So for me, at that point, I decided, okay, I want to be here, I want to improve this technology, I want to bring this technology to the people. I want to use this technology for doing good to the people.
00:02:21.846 - 00:02:54.674, Speaker C: And well, there is a lot of problems this technology has, but one of those is that this technology doesn't scale. I mean, Bitcoin, you can do maybe 1000 transactions every ten minutes. I mean, you can do whatever you want, but you go nowhere. I mean, you can play with free ends, but not much more than that. Ethereum is a little bit better, but not scale. Anyway, so I started to see at that point the scalability was like a holy grail. At that point the solutions were there, didn't convince me at all.
00:02:54.674 - 00:03:37.322, Speaker C: Here was all these payment channels, these lighting networks was today. But there was one project that, okay, this looks like different, and somehow this project was called Plasma, long time ago with a lot of things, but you start seeing there that, okay, here there is something that looks interesting. And together with that, remember reading some of the Vitalik blog posts about zero knowledge they implemented? I mean, they added these padding functions inside the mean, these pre compiled smart contracts in there. So I start just getting there. I studying there. Well, I'm learning there. I just wrote circum.
00:03:37.322 - 00:03:44.594, Speaker C: It's just no weekend. I need to write that. So I just wrote Circum at that point. Just wrote the Snarkjs. Of course, I reroll like three times after that.
00:03:44.632 - 00:03:47.694, Speaker B: But free weekend. Then you build a new programming language.
00:03:47.742 - 00:03:52.614, Speaker D: For ZK and Circum. Like, I think it's the most used circuit language I think these days.
00:03:52.652 - 00:03:52.854, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:52.892 - 00:03:58.118, Speaker A: Today I think it's just casually dropping inventing a programming language over a weekend. Everybody else caught that.
00:03:58.204 - 00:04:26.954, Speaker C: Yeah, but I wanted to understand how these things work and then, okay, I just did that. Okay. But of course then there is a lot of work that happens after that. But the basic things was done quite fast. And you start seeing what projects like Semaphore at that point. I mean projects like tornado cash. I remember Tornado Cash was a cool story because I was right Circumfering.
00:04:26.954 - 00:04:49.014, Speaker C: And there was a couple of guys that told me, hey, we want to use that to make a mixer. And they tell you, okay, do whatever you want. Don't put my name in there. And not for what happened, just because Circum was not production ready at all. So it was more for not losing money. Yes, yeah, exactly. So actually they did it.
00:04:49.014 - 00:05:16.442, Speaker C: I mean, there was some bugs. We discovered we were like auditing a lot of help here in the community. Auditing, they fix it and well, Tornado Cash was a reality out of that. But then many other projects happened at that point. So we got deep, deep with Circum. Then we created Identi. Identi was tried to create a protocol for digital identity, mainly using zero knowledge, using Circum.
00:05:16.442 - 00:05:41.018, Speaker C: That was like part of that. And with this technology at point they say, okay, actually we can build roll ups. And here is a famous blog post of Vitalik explaining the idea behind rollups. It was written by Vitalik, but I thought it was Barry WhiteHat and many other people in the Ethereum Foundation that were thinking about this idea. And we were talking a lot. And this, okay, this is like a plasma, but the real you're talking about.
00:05:41.024 - 00:05:42.778, Speaker A: Plasma becoming roll ups. Exactly.
00:05:42.864 - 00:06:15.422, Speaker C: And this blog post is important because sincere we start working on that and we created in RN Three, which says, okay, let's freeze the project from identity and let's focus on creating a payments roll up. And we were evolving Circum and all the tooling. And we created this Hermes. What's? Hermes 10. And after that we created a Hermes. We put it in production, we go ready? And after that, there was Barry. Barry WhiteHat from the theorem foundation.
00:06:15.422 - 00:06:24.280, Speaker C: They came to my home in Switzerland, and he was telling me we have to do a zikvm. And I tell you, okay, you are crazy, right?
00:06:24.650 - 00:06:30.040, Speaker A: This is for the audience. Tell us why that was a crazy idea and what were the constraints that made it sound crazy.
00:06:30.810 - 00:07:16.982, Speaker C: It was not feasible. If you do want to do, for example, multiplication in 256 multiplications, you need already thousands of hundreds of thousands of constraints. And the maximum you can get is maybe 120,000,000 or something like that. And this is just one multiplication. But if you want to do that many multiplications, it just doesn't fit. I mean, the EVM was not prepared to be embedded inside ZK circuit and was at this point that well, Barry just explained me all these new advances that happen with polynomials, with polynomial relationships. And here it's okay, you can do a lot of things.
00:07:16.982 - 00:07:46.094, Speaker C: And we were start, okay, we have true as an exercise, I think it's impossible, but let's try it. And then you go to all the different problems, all the different okay, how we solve the memory, how we solve the culling, one smart contract to another smart contract, how we solve ECDSA. And we were running to all the major problems, and we're trying to figure out each of the pieces. And we arrived to a kind of a theoretical solution. I said this should be possible, doing.
00:07:46.132 - 00:07:54.350, Speaker A: This way, and this is possible, as in we can do it, or this is like, oh, we can maybe eventually make all of it work, but right now we're only seeing some parts.
00:07:54.430 - 00:08:53.190, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's like, okay, this away, I mean, at least it's a path and this should be okay, but very complex thing, and it's very complex and we end up with a very complicated things to do. But we are just thinking on that and we're simplifying the things and at one point say, okay, this is definitely possible, we don't know how much will it take to generate the proof. We did the first estimations and we were measuring the proof generation in number of data centers. That's the thing. But technically, it should be possible to generate this proof. And we start going deep on that. There was a presentation that we gave in Paris two years ago, and here it's not that long ago, and I explained, okay, we can build the zkvm using all these polynomial commitments with Plc apps, things that in Aftech, they did all this amazing work, plung plocap Blockish, all the work from Starks.
00:08:53.190 - 00:09:25.650, Speaker C: We just took a lot of technologies around created by the community. We put them all together and we start working on that. At the beginning, while we had to convince first I had to convince my partners. I mean, it's not easy. You're doing something that nobody believes that's going to be working. But here is the partners. And then very soon I think was just after this conference in Paris to these guys and says okay, we want to scale Ethereum.
00:09:25.650 - 00:10:03.034, Speaker C: We believe in what you're doing and legend forces and I think was a very good partnership. But it's like okay, we know how to do this technology, we know how is this decay. But we had all the experience even in Hermes One. So we don't know how to get adoption and how to use. I don't want to build systems that only myself is using. I mean, I want this to scale and to provide. And I mean, Polygon did an amazing job already on that.
00:10:03.034 - 00:10:46.778, Speaker C: So at this point we decided to join forces together. At the same time with Polygon, there was other two teams that were crucial for the Zkvm. Here is the polygon zero, was mere at the time, but was converted to Polygon zero and polygon maiden. We were trying to solve the same thing, but from different angles and different things. And we start to work together. And work together is I mean, we set up some good economic incentives and some good framework for collaboration. So it's like, okay, you just want to solve the problem and you just start talking with each other in a transparent way explaining okay, we are trying to solve this this way, we are trying to solve this that way.
00:10:46.778 - 00:11:41.900, Speaker C: We took all the technology from Polygon Zero or the god Delogs or the Plunky Two and all this amazing record. Lot of innovation that was in there. We took all the maiden, I mean, all the meditation, all the knowledge of Stark on there. We were of course in Hermes we were continue working and we were during these two years has been like all these original problems that we start and many more that came later. Were just solving them, fine tuning them, finding the right solution, going one direction, saying okay, maybe there is a better way, let's just move it and move it in the other direction. A lot of prototyping and here we were able also to hire an amazing team was people that when you have a good funding and when you have a good thing, you can find the right people and you can convince to the project. It was a clear project for me.
00:11:41.900 - 00:12:10.034, Speaker C: It's the most important project for me. It's an honor to be in this project. So I took the best people that I knew in my history, some of them even from outside the blockchain, and said we have to build this. And I put the best people that I know as a team to create that. And has been solving challenge after challenge from engineering. Solving challenge is the best thing. Satisfying, so it's satisfying.
00:12:10.034 - 00:12:38.030, Speaker C: And it was like every week we had like two, three challenges. So it has been like working really hard, highly motivated, not a big team, but I mean, good enough team to create all that and during these two years has been day and night working but enjoying a lot at the same time. And, well, we created the polygon Ckbm. I mean, this is a fact and this is a reality right now from.
00:12:38.100 - 00:12:40.650, Speaker A: This .3 data centers to now it's.
00:12:40.730 - 00:12:43.150, Speaker C: Sorry for answering too long, but no.
00:12:43.220 - 00:13:26.734, Speaker A: I mean, if anything, this deserves a round of applause for just the amount of amazing progress they've made in such a small time. I remember a year ago people thought Zkvms would be crazy because just everybody looks at it from the constraints like this is not possible. And here we are. So it is extremely impressive that we've been able to get here. And the best part to me is now it falls into, okay, we know we can do it and now people can just assume this exists and they can just build on it and not worry about it. And that's the world where I want to be in because that's the only way you get to actually see people build things that are interesting and useful to them and the people that they care about. And I want to focus on that.
00:13:26.734 - 00:13:54.920, Speaker A: So Zkvms definitely a dark horse moment, but Polygon or originally matic kind of has been around as a proof of stake chain for a handful of years. And recently you kind of talked about and announced your transition to Polygon 2.0. So maybe my first question would be kind of from a slightly technical standpoint on just what's different, what's 2.0 and kind of what should people really know about and take away from this?
00:13:55.290 - 00:14:26.994, Speaker B: Thanks. Polygon 2.0 is, I would say, a radical overhaul of polygon technology and the point of convergence first and foremost, in my personal opinion of everything we have done so far. So when we started Polygon, we knew that we want to build this infinitely scalable platform of web free to scale ethereum to achieve mainstream adoption or global adoption. That was clear. And it was clear that it's going to be some sort of MultiChain, multilayer two paradigm. That was kind of obvious.
00:14:26.994 - 00:15:03.822, Speaker B: Everything else was kind of blurry, unclear still. We wanted to experiment with all meaningful scaling approaches and we have done that so far. From plasma to side chains to roll ups to validiums. We experimented with multiple client development efforts, multiple ZK efforts. As Jordi mentioned, we intentionally encouraged this kind of innovation. We were aware that this is very early stage of this industry and this architecture and infrastructure is very complex. And we intentionally allowed that kind of period of divergence, I would say, for these kind of almost two years.
00:15:03.822 - 00:15:07.934, Speaker B: Where we had these really multiple approaches and encouraged different you're talking about your.
00:15:07.972 - 00:15:11.374, Speaker A: Experiments on scaling with different exactly like.
00:15:11.492 - 00:15:20.482, Speaker B: All these efforts and the small downside of that is that people often have been confused so far. Why are you doing so much what's the purpose why you have this many.
00:15:20.536 - 00:15:24.420, Speaker A: Seven EVM strategies, KVM strategies at a time. Is that the right number?
00:15:25.430 - 00:15:59.360, Speaker B: I think so, I'm not sure. Yeah. Anyways, we really wanted that period of kind of divergence and exploration and slowly we started converging. Things became more obvious along the way. We realized that, as Jordi said, what was highly uncertain, the practicality and viability of Zkavm. It became obvious that it's very much viable and very much practical with current level of it transfer proving costs of zero point $48.85. So $0.
00:15:59.360 - 00:16:34.762, Speaker B: It's practically insignificant kind of for practical purposes, so to say. So we slowly started converging towards something. And that something is Polygon 2.0. It's first and foremost this technological or protocol stack that we are proposing that has four different layers. One is the Staking layer where the validators of the ecosystem lived. On top of it, it's interoperability layer, I would say one of a kind and hopefully game changing interoperability layer. I'm not sure how much we can go into that, how much time we have.
00:16:34.762 - 00:17:27.494, Speaker B: On top of it is the execution layer, which is pretty commoditized layer. Like with any blockchain it just produces blocks, collates transactions, just these standard blockchain things. And on top of that, is this also one of a kind kind of prover layer or ZK layer that we are very proud of with highly performant, I mean the best in the industry prover, which is Plonky Two with Plonky free being around the corner with significant improvements over Plonky Two which is still the industry leading prover. On top of it we have DSL language that Jordy has built, another language that Jordy built over some free weekends. And we used it practically to define Zkevm. It's polynomial identity language. Jordy is working on Pill Two and there is also part of a group that previously was Ethereum Foundation that works on something similar which is called Powder.
00:17:27.494 - 00:18:36.562, Speaker B: And we're exploring potentially collaboration, potentially very excited about that. And basically we really believe that that prover layer can become kind of the standard for ZK virtual machine definition when you have basically the most performant prover in the industry. On top of that virtual machine defining framework and on top of that you can build any virtual machine Zkvm that we already have midnvm that we're working on is already going to be built on top of this DSL ZK WASM anything basically. So all in all, this is like sorry, it's like that one consolidated stack that is the result of this exploration process that have been lasted for like two years practically and that is moving forward. The North Star of Polygon in terms of technology. And after all this exploration, we are now very confident that this is the way to go and this architecture can support mainstream adoption without sacrificing security and still fully relying on Ethereum and all. So all in all, it's mainly architectural kind of consolidation and public commitment to this technological tech.
00:18:36.562 - 00:18:38.020, Speaker B: So to say yeah, sorry.
00:18:38.710 - 00:18:39.026, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:39.048 - 00:19:16.960, Speaker D: But I want to add about your specific question about polygon POS chain. Right. From the very start we have always been very clear that this is not a side chain. Currently that's the technology that is possible, but then we are going to make it a layer two. We are extremely Ethereum aligned and this sometimes it makes me emotional, sometimes it makes me angry also because sometimes random people on Twitter who have done nothing for Ethereum, they would question my loyalty. Right. I think I've been on the forefronts whenever there is a competitive pressure on Ethereum and things like that.
00:19:16.960 - 00:20:03.706, Speaker D: But that has been a promise forever from our side that we are going to convert it into a layer two only. And now that the technology is available, all the other chains are also like the app chains that we launched. We already have spun out the polygon Zkevm SuperNet stack, as you saw, like nosis, Pay and IDEX. And so many protocols are launching on those Zkevm based app chains and the goal is to make this infinitely growing trustless compute layer which will have decentralization on many of the chains to offer censorship, resistance and all that. But then all of this, the settlement and the security provided by Ethereum, that was the ultimate goal and we will keep progressing towards that. There is no question on that.
00:20:03.808 - 00:20:37.650, Speaker A: Absolutely. And if anything, I don't think you should have to say that the work you've done in just kind of moving the space forward from just even the tech and the cryptographic kind of contributions speaks for that. So that's amazing. So would it be fair to say that kind of, from your perspective, Cindy, kind of the attempts we're seeing on the Op stack or the ZK stack and just other kind of ways people are thinking about the app specific world that's complementary, not competitive or how do you feel that long term overlaps with polygon's vision?
00:20:37.810 - 00:20:56.922, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, we all are vying for the same thing, that the security provided by Ethereum chain, ethereum main chain, the value probably generates, or basically we are all creating this value layer of internet. Right? And that value needs to have a very strong and decentralized basis, which is Ethereum.
00:20:56.986 - 00:20:57.358, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:57.444 - 00:21:36.486, Speaker D: And then you know that when you are generating millions or billions of dollars of value, you are storing that value on this web three internet or this internet of value. The guidelines are extremely, extremely strong in the form of Ethereum. So all of us are doing the same thing in that longer vision. And it's about these different, different approaches. We are working on our approaches. Obviously, as researchers, engineers, builders, we believe that our approach is better. Some of the similar people might believe the same, but I think it's more about traction and network effects.
00:21:36.486 - 00:22:01.986, Speaker D: What technology is available today? I think from polygon side. We strongly believe that our stack is ready today. Most of the research problems from our side have been solved. It's more about the engineering stack is available today. You can launch your ZK chains today. There is no future promises or anything like that. So in that sense, yes, we feel that this is a more viable stack currently.
00:22:01.986 - 00:22:28.710, Speaker D: But then eventually many of these other stacks, this will become more and more commoditized. And at the end of the day, what we are focused on this interoperability layer which allows all the chains to settle into Ethereum but also be seamlessly interoperable the way the internet is interoperable today. So yeah, in that sense it's not competitive. The mission is the same for everyone and we cheer for everyone from the sidelines, whoever is working on this mission.
00:22:28.790 - 00:22:59.042, Speaker A: No, that's amazing. You said something super interesting. So I understand the value layer argument of the Internet. That means we're seeing where different worlds kind of exist that are kind of community specific, app specific overall, just kind of adjacent sometimes or sometimes on top. How does interacting with these things work with each other? I think the blog post talked about the concept of supernets. What is that? How do you kind of transfer value between these worlds? And what's like a good intuition about how this would work in 2.0?
00:22:59.176 - 00:23:28.730, Speaker D: Let me first try a simplistic definition of that and then maybe Mihalo or Jody can take a more technical version of it. But basically it's very simple. Like we are imagining a MultiChain vault where everybody, if you are a college student in dorm room, you can spin up your own chain and have probably potentially millions of dollars of value on that. But then at the end you are proving everything thing using ZK proofs to Ethereum and for the faster collaboration between each other, you are proving.
