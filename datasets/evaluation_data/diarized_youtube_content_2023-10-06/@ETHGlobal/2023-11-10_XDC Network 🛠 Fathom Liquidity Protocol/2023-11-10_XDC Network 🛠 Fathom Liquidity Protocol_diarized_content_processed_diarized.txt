00:00:08.090 - 00:00:47.440, Speaker A: Thank you for joining Fathom Webinar. We will discuss the Fathom liquidity protocol on the XDC network. Fathom has several components. The first two are our main products FXD Stablecoin and Fathom Dex. We plan to release more products in Fathom 20 fathom is a decentralized protocol operated by Dow. Dow Governance is based on FTHM Governance token and Staking, through which users can get voting power and rewards. In Fathom, we have a goal make real world assets more accessible on chain.
00:00:47.440 - 00:00:57.872, Speaker A: Fathom Governance can vote not only for protocol updates, but also for decisions about onboarding new assets into the protocol. We have the tokenization system for compliance.
00:00:57.936 - 00:01:01.396, Speaker B: Aware RWA protocol income can also be.
00:01:01.418 - 00:01:20.248, Speaker A: Distributed via Governance voting FTHM stakers will have even more incentivization with XDC staking. FXD, the stablecoin at the heart of Fathom embodies a blend of strategic financial mechanisms designed to ensure stability, liquidity and value retention.
00:01:20.424 - 00:01:24.456, Speaker B: Here's how it operates lenders deposit collateral.
00:01:24.568 - 00:02:19.600, Speaker A: Initially XDC to borrow FXD. Each FXD issuance is backed by collateral exceeding its value safeguarding against market volatility. FXD is pegged to $1, maintaining a steady value. A private stable swap module initially facilitates FXD swaps with other stable assets at a onetoone rate, with plans to decentralize as liquidity grows. If FXD price surges above $1, minting new FXD becomes attractive, inducing a selling pressure to restore the Peg. Conversely, if FXD dips below $1, buying FXD to close borrowing positions becomes favorable, creating a buying pressure to realign the price. Intelligent FSLs activates when an FXD position requires liquidation due to price drops, ensuring effective liquidation with minimized costs to avert bad debt risk.
00:02:19.600 - 00:03:20.952, Speaker A: A stability fee is accrued to permanently cover bad debt, with excess potentially contributing to protocol revenue. As the ecosystem matures, institutional collateral will be onboarded, expanding the FXD collateral base beyond XDC. Lenders can utilize FXD across Fathom products or external protocols to earn additional yields, be it through liquidity provision, trading on Fathom decks, or participating in vaults. Plans are underway to onboard real world assets as collateral for FXD, opening avenues for diversified collateral pools and further stabilizing the FXD value. FXD is not merely a stablecoin, but a gateway to a broader, more resilient financial ecosystem. It's the linchpin that facilitates a harmonious interaction between digital assets and real world assets, steering Fathom towards its vision of a balanced and inclusive financial realm. FXD core components are CDPs.
00:03:20.952 - 00:03:32.736, Speaker A: FXD is backed by collateral exceeding its value. Flash loan liquidators can access the necessary tokens to repay debt. Stable swap additional layer of FXD Pegging.
00:03:32.768 - 00:03:37.956, Speaker B: Mechanism through Arbitrage liquidation module operates utilizing.
00:03:37.988 - 00:04:22.786, Speaker A: Fixed spread liquidation that activates when an FXD position requires liquidation due to price drops. Price Oracles determines the current market price of different assets used as collateral in the CDPs. Fathom uses several price sources utilizing volume weighted average price VWAP model. If prices significantly differ, the new price won't be accepted by protocol. Please scan QR for more technical details about Fathom and FXD. You can see the Fathom DAP, FXD.
00:04:22.818 - 00:04:27.366, Speaker B: Dashboard protocol stats, available collateral pools, and.
00:04:27.388 - 00:04:51.796, Speaker A: A list of user positions. Let's open the new position. Users can choose how much XDC to collateralize. We recommend choosing Safemax to make your position safety enough. It will make a safety buffer of 25%, though you can go up to 1% safety buffer. You will be warned since that is.
00:04:51.818 - 00:04:58.516, Speaker B: Dangerous, always better to keep a higher buffer. You can read the details of your.
00:04:58.538 - 00:05:12.164, Speaker A: New position before making the transaction. When you are ready, click the open new position button. We support several wallets, including MetaMask XDC.
00:05:12.292 - 00:05:16.092, Speaker B: Wallet connect XDC network is really fast.
00:05:16.146 - 00:05:17.368, Speaker A: And you can see the results.
00:05:17.384 - 00:05:18.620, Speaker B: In 2 seconds.
00:05:20.960 - 00:06:03.760, Speaker A: The new position will appear in your position list. Pay attention to the position's safety buffer. It depends on the current XDC price. You can manage your position, add more collateral and borrow more FXD or repay your debt taking collateral back. Top up position works in the same way as creating a new position, but for the existing one. You can choose to repay the part of the position or close it fully.
00:06:05.060 - 00:06:28.694, Speaker B: First, let's pay the part of the debt now.

00:06:32.650 - 00:06:36.338, Speaker A: You need to pay more than you borrowed. Because you are also covering the stability.
00:06:36.434 - 00:06:51.650, Speaker B: Fee, you repaid your debt fully. The next part of the Fathom app is Dao.
00:06:53.030 - 00:06:56.594, Speaker A: The important part of it is Staking for FTHM governance.
00:06:56.642 - 00:07:03.846, Speaker B: Token of Fathom staking allows one to receive rewards, and voting power users can.
00:07:03.868 - 00:07:17.530, Speaker A: Lock FTHM for a period of time receiving more rewards. Voting power can be used in governance to create proposals and vote for them. Proposals may contain automation, a call to another smart contract.
00:07:21.130 - 00:07:26.250, Speaker B: The next part is Fathom decks. You can trade.
00:07:30.000 - 00:07:56.536, Speaker A: And participate in liquidity pools. We target Fathom decks to become the main trading place for tokenized RWA on the XTC network. For that, we will make many improvements for it soon. Stable pools, better trading routes. All our work you can find on.
00:07:56.558 - 00:07:57.320, Speaker B: GitHub.
00:08:00.490 - 00:08:33.818, Speaker A: For example FXD Smart contracts. We appreciate the community participation in the development and will carefully review all found issues and improvement proposals. You also can find open source subgraphs for all our products. You can use them if you are creating a project that utilizes Fathom, FXD or other products. Don't hesitate to participate in Fathom app development. XDC network differs from regular EVM. Aside from other changes, it has an XDC prefix for addresses.
00:08:33.818 - 00:09:09.622, Speaker A: That is why in our work we are using modified libraries. Fathom ethers fork of ethers JS fathom web3 fork of rust web3 XDC three JS fork of web3 JS not our development. Fathom ethers and XDC three JS are JavaScript libraries for interacting with the XDC network and its ecosystem. Fathom underscore web3 is a rust crate that serves the same purpose. We published Fathom, ethers and other related packages to npmjs.com. You also can find XDC three JS.
00:09:09.686 - 00:09:10.300, Speaker B: There.
00:09:17.700 - 00:09:48.710, Speaker A: Fathom underscore web3 can be found in cratesregistrycrates IO and lib rs. The last thing you need is public RPC for XDC Mainet. You can find the list on Chainlist for the chain at 50. For XDC testnet apotham, you can find the list also on Chainlist for the chain at 51. Thank you and let's build together.
