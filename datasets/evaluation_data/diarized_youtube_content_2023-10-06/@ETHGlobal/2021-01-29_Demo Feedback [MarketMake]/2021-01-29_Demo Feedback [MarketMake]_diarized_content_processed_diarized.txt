00:00:14.840 - 00:00:56.552, Speaker A: All right, I'm just going to get one more confirmation that this is recording properly and then we can get started. Great. Okay, so again, for those who just joined, this is the market make demo feedback session. So what we're going to do is similar to the first one if you'd attended last week. We have a couple members of the Ave team. David and Mark will be joining a little bit later and then Nicola from Lumnniscap and they're going to be giving feedback on what you've been working on so far. So again, like last week, you'll have a few minutes to present what you're working on and then they will give you some tips on how to improve your presentation or maybe some things you hadn't considered.
00:00:56.552 - 00:01:23.924, Speaker A: And in general, hopefully this is part of improving your submission for next Sunday, the February 7. So I'm really excited to get started. Nicholas, since it's your first time, do you want to give a quick intro to who you are and what you sure, sure. Hello everybody. Thank you for having me. I'm with Lamniscap Shasha, my colleague and partner. Give an introduction last time.
00:01:23.924 - 00:02:10.124, Speaker A: So, a crypto native investment firm, Venture Capital, focused on very early stage crypto networks and blockchain startups. I joined Lenscap in early 2018. So since the outset, basically we speak with many projects, try to give us feedback and support their roadmap in terms of product token economics and all the protocol canvas and the participant and agents and how they interact with each other in the protocol. That's something I try to give a lot of focus on when we examine projects. But that's about it. Great. Simple, straightforward.
00:02:10.124 - 00:02:28.570, Speaker A: Thanks for joining. I appreciate you giving a little bit of time to hackers and then just the overall event. So I think we will start off right away with Lev ade. Marco, are you ready? Yeah. Hello everyone. I'm ready. I'll share my screen.
00:02:28.570 - 00:03:46.640, Speaker A: Okay. So I'll get started with some transactions because it's quite slow with the fork main net. And while it load, I'll start explaining about our project. Let's confirm this. Okay, so Levavi it's platform to open leveraged position powered by Ave liquidity and one inch exchange. It works with Flash loan. So basically it started from the one inch Bantia where in just one transaction we're going to open the leveraged position, putting some collateral first, taking a flash loan, doing the trade on one inch and then repaying the flash loan after we made the trade with one inch and we deposited the collateral on Ave protocol.
00:03:46.640 - 00:04:46.340, Speaker A: So we tried to made a quite simple interface, taking inspiration from Uniswap and all the others automated market makers. We implemented some functions, of course for the leverage part of our app. So, for example, finally here we got our main transaction. So the first two transactions, the first one it was for approved the collateral to be spent on our contract. And the second one it was for approved delegation of the debt token that we need to complete the whole operation actually to allow the contract to borrow on our behalf. So yeah, I'll confirm it and execute the trade the moment it's bit expensive. It's around 1 million gas.
00:04:46.340 - 00:06:14.160, Speaker A: We believe that with some optimization we can go maybe to around 500,600 thousand. But consider the flesh loan involved and although the transactions, we're not sure we can go below that. So we opened our position and here the app is showing us the position that we have opened. We have put ten web as collateral and we have booked a position of 882 links. And here on the app when we are interacting with it here we can say the position size which is basically the eight organs that we will receive. While here smaller we have the swap price which is the spot price with five rapid how many links we would get on the spot price. So we can then close the position and go ahead actually again because it's going to get slow again and we have to approve the first time again because this is another stock and this is the eight link that we are approving to be transferred by our wallet.
00:06:14.160 - 00:08:11.350, Speaker A: Going back, going back to the interface here, we can decide to either open a long position or a short position the moment we decided to go for just a few fixed leverage amount axis and yeah, finally we can close our position and it's not closing instantly because we're still improving the UX. So there's just a polling going on every 2 seconds but the final idea will be to just close it automatically once the transaction is confirmed. So yeah, about the leverage, we decided to offer a more user friendly user experience for the user, just three fixed amount of leverage and for the long position it's two x, three x and four x, while for the short position it's one x, two x and three x. Actually based on the collateral chose and the leveraged asset, not always it will be possible to open a four x long or three x short based on because different collaterals have different loan to value. And so even if there's no position open on the protocol, maybe if we choose some particular pairs it will fail because of not enough collateral to execute the drape. Basically it would go below L factor one as the size of the drape. Marco, do you want to wrap up there and then we can move on to feedback? Sure.
00:08:11.350 - 00:08:34.510, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Yeah. Nicola David. And I think Mark joined. If you want to just go ahead and give your feedback or thoughts on this. And it doesn't have to just be remember, we're talking about the concept. We're talking about a little bit of the presentation, but there will be more of that next week, and then the UI is pretty fleshed out, so you can also give feedback on that.
00:08:34.510 - 00:08:48.080, Speaker A: So I can go on unless David, you want to? No, no, go ahead. Oh, Nicola. Whatever. Doesn't matter. Well, go ahead, Mark. Go ahead, Mark. Thank you.
00:08:48.080 - 00:09:20.492, Speaker A: So, first thing, good job on the UI. The Uniswap model is super simple. The community is already used to it and what you were able to build in just a few days is super simple to use. That's the first time I saw your demo and I already know in terms of UX, oh, I can use it and what to do. And that's a super cool thing. I will have a few subjects if you want to improve from that point. The first thing is that it's very close.
00:09:20.492 - 00:10:29.036, Speaker A: That what we can already do on deficever.com, you're probably aware of it, where you can automate your leverage position in terms of gas optimization probably as you use Flash loan, you will have to do leverage loops. So basically you borrow, then you deposit to increase your collateral, then you borrow again and so on and so forth. So the higher your leverage, the higher the cost in gas probably is. And what I could suggest maybe as a pathway to do it, maybe explore credit delegation so you can use Flash loan to take some liquidity from the Ave protocol and open position and then at the end of your transaction pay back your loans. But maybe it's a pathway to consider to have credit delegation to directly take a credit line from a third party and basically pay the interest from your position because it's a leveraged position. So you have some interest to pay as long as the position is open.
00:10:29.036 - 00:10:56.792, Speaker A: And maybe that can be a pathway that nobody did to the best of my knowledge yet. And that can be something fun to explore. And last things, just the details. All a tokens. Okay, I see the comments. All a tokens and all Ave tokens in the protocol. Version two, support the permit method.
00:10:56.792 - 00:11:54.524, Speaker A: So it's just a small thing, but I see that you still use the approved path to close a position, all this kind of stuff, in order for your user to save on some gas. Because right now you are using a main net fork, but on main net, like just an approved transaction could cost four, five, $6 and take some time because you have to wait for that transaction to be included inside the block to then execute the actual operation. Using the permit pathway can save time and money in this kind of interaction. So that might be something cool to explore as well. Thank you, Mark. I can go ahead if you want. Is there anybody want to comment ahead? Mark? Okay.
00:11:54.524 - 00:12:37.310, Speaker A: David? Yes. Thank mean very sleek. I like it. Simple, intuitive. Two quick things. One is you think it would be interesting to have a loan, basically to collateral ratio exposed there in case of you choose the collateral that you want to deposit and you think it might be useful to have that somewhere so you can actually see the availability and in a sense, also the leverage that you can use with that. So that's the first question.
00:12:37.310 - 00:13:28.300, Speaker A: The second, it's about the stop loss that you mentioned the other time. I think it's interesting and I think on futures or on leverage positions, it's something very useful, but it's quite complicated. So I wanted to know if you had an update, especially on thinking or how you would go about it to create that one and how you have been developed. The idea so far. Okay, so about the surplus, unfortunately we decided that we probably won't have the time to do it for the time of the hackathon. So, yeah, we've been focusing on improving the app and having those basic functionalities work as best as possible. Sure.
00:13:28.300 - 00:14:52.564, Speaker A: But yeah, for the implementation, I think as was suggested by the one inch bounty idea, I think it would work with the chain link Oracle, but actually we didn't dive in and researched about it, so really don't have a clear answer for that. And about the first question, so did you mean to check how much liquidity is available to borrow from Ave for Flesh loans also, but also in terms of your ratio and how powerful your leverage would be and how collateralized you are, depending on which collateral you can choose from. Right, it's sort of like which one I choose and what's the ratio, just to have it there instead to do the maths on your head. Basically the idea it was maybe not to show too many stats that could confuse users, but make all the calculation on the backend and just less than no users in the UI if the trade that he wants to do, it wouldn't be possible. And also show all different stats like health factor long to value. Makes sense. Makes sense.
00:14:52.564 - 00:15:24.412, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Thank you. I think some good comments have already been made. Any comment? I'd have, by the way, this is fantastic. UI release leak and everything as well. So really good implementation would be yeah, like they're saying you can pull out, I guess the LTV values of certain reserves. So you should be able to sort of calculate on the fly if they select link or whatever collateral, you should be able to know that they're capable of this amount of leverage.
00:15:24.412 - 00:16:20.496, Speaker A: So I think on the UI that's pretty important because you don't want someone over leveraging and then the transaction failing and spending, whatever, $50 on transaction costs and I think that would smooth out the UI a bit. And then another UI thing would be on the Ave app, one of the things that we do is when a user takes a borrow position, it will say your current health factor and this will be your new health factor. So if you could have something like that, because I think that helps people a lot because leveraging can seem like free money, but there's associated risk. So if people see that taking a three X leverage, actually the health factor is going to be like 1.2, which is pretty dangerous. That can help them decide on the risk. So I'd say try and implement something like that.
00:16:20.496 - 00:16:37.076, Speaker A: It doesn't have to be a health factor. It could just be like a little message at the bottom that's in red that says, hey, this could be dangerous or this could be safe, or things like that. That's all the feedback. Thank you. Awesome. What a great start. Thank you, Marco, for presenting.
00:16:37.076 - 00:17:00.130, Speaker A: And we're going to move on to the next project, Watchful Eye. Do you want to get started with your presentation? Yeah, sure. Apologize. My webcam is kind of messed up right now. No problem. All right, are you all seeing that? Yes. Okay.
00:17:00.130 - 00:17:59.420, Speaker A: Sorry, just to check, is this a demo or are you presenting? Yes, I just have the PDF open. Great. So this is the diagram of how things will work, but this isn't important right now. So we have the Watchful Eye, which is an automated stop loss bot that uses obviously Ave Flash loans, as you can see up here. So when you pop onto the website, this is what you're presented with, money bag with an eye on it. So this is the dashboard, and right now there are only two actions that you can make. We don't have the stop loss bot implemented yet, but we have a debt repayment and collateral swap using Ave splash loans.
00:17:59.420 - 00:19:01.780, Speaker A: So the first thing you can do, in fact, when you come onto the website, this is what would happen in the first place anyway. You'd begin the Watchful Eyes ritual, which is just obviously putting the information about your loan and the price limits that you want to act upon. So I already have these filled out, but let's say that we have 100 die in debt and the collateral is we have ten link as collateral that's being locked up right now. And the price limit for die, it's usually around one. So let's just put it at one. And let's say that link is at $23. If link goes below $23, then we want to take out a flash loan, repay the die debt, get the link, swap that for die and repay the Flash loan and then transfer the rest back to the user.
00:19:01.780 - 00:20:03.472, Speaker A: So, yes, for the Eyes blessing. There we go. We're going to have quite a few transactions because in this version, we've had to mock the swaps and the debt. Hopefully before the end of the actual hackathon, we'll have the debt repayment implemented using Ave. So first off, we have to set up all of this data to be saved into the contract so we can act upon it later. Second, we have to approve the transfer, the Watchfly contract to transfer all of our link which is our collateral. And I might have clicked the button a few times.
00:20:03.472 - 00:20:46.564, Speaker A: Whoops. Third, this is actually part of the demo version. We have some fake contracts that are set up that will kind of act like the swap and the debt repayment should be this should say die. Not exactly sure why demo Gods are not with me right now. Like I said, I clicked on it a few times. I think that should have been fine regardless. Okay, this is the one that I was expecting.
00:20:46.564 - 00:21:50.150, Speaker A: So 1000 die and this is transferred to another contract which will swap the link for the die. And these last two would not be there in the full version. So confirm that that should pop up once that transaction succeeds. There we go. So when we have the actual bot it will check the position. And we're planning on using Chainlink Oracles to implement like the we're going to use a Cron initiator which allows us to call a smart contract function on a Cert have crossed over what the actual prices are at the current moment, every certain interval. And if those prices have been reached or surpassed, then it would make a Flash loan and liquidate the position.
00:21:50.150 - 00:22:15.914, Speaker A: So we're calling that the Eyes blessing. So I'm going to do that manually and MetaMask should pop up in a second. There we go. So gas fee is kind of I can't see the Metabask window by the way. You can or you can't? We can't. Dang. Well, I can't see it.
00:22:15.914 - 00:23:06.050, Speaker A: The gas fee is zero point 16. So I went ahead and confirmed that and instead of waiting for it to complete and then show up on Ether scan, I actually have one that I ran right before this. We can all see this window, right? Yeah. All right, cool. So as you can see, goes from the Ave lending pool to my contract, the Watchful Eye. And the Watchful I sends that to repay debt, sends 100 die. The debt amount gets back ten link and there's some extra things that happen to make sure that the collateral gets to the Watchful Eye contract.
00:23:06.050 - 00:23:32.474, Speaker A: The Watchful Eye sends the link to a swap and gets 200 die in return. And the original Flash loan gets repaid plus the fee. And then the difference gets sent back to the user. And that's how the Watchful I works at the moment. Thank you. Awesome. Looking really good.
00:23:32.474 - 00:23:51.574, Speaker A: I appreciate the use of Scaffold ETH. I'm imagining that probably saved you a ton of yeah. Yeah, it was pretty helpful. Cool. Yeah. Anybody just jump in with their comments or suggestions? More than comment on suggestion. Have you thought about it's? Pretty cool.
00:23:51.574 - 00:25:26.294, Speaker A: Very useful. I can tell. Have you thought about integrations? Not really as a standalone, but product, but maybe something that could be applicable to an existing protocol or something like that. Have you thought about integration and where you could go down that road. Do you mean for the debt repayment or the swaps? Yeah, actually, before the end of the hackathon, we're hoping to it's kind of the lowest hanging fruit, but to allow debt repayment or liquidation on Ave because we're using the testnet and those token addresses are obviously they're the same with borrowing as they are with flash loans on Ave. For swaps, we actually intended initially to use one inch because there was a bounty for that, but that ran into some issues, which is why we made the MVP be kind of a mocked debt repayment and mocked token swap. But the end vision for it would be to you.
00:25:26.294 - 00:26:14.120, Speaker A: Pick what protocol you want to that a you want to repay the debt for liquidate on b what protocol you want to or what decks you want to swap? The collateral to the flash loan asset with and obviously have more selection on what your collateral asset is and what your debt asset is. But for the hackathon, this is what we hacked together thus far. Good stuff. Thank you. Good stuff. Thank you. I think it's a great start.
00:26:14.120 - 00:27:19.290, Speaker A: Similar to what Mark mentioned previously, using the permit function for this would probably help. So what the permit function allows is you don't need to do the approve and essentially they sign an approved transaction and then they hand it to you somewhere. Then you can run that transaction before you do the transfer transaction. So that can save on some gas costs and then I'm not sure if it's good for now or for later. But what you could also do is similar to DeFi save and instadap, they have like a smart wallet or proxy contract. So the trouble here is that you have to do all those approves and you have to make sure that all the approves are proper and all that sort of stuff, which can get a bit unmanageable or difficult to manage. But if you use a proxy contract like DS proxy, and if that proxy owns the position, it becomes quite a bit easier to manage these sort of things.
00:27:19.290 - 00:27:49.426, Speaker A: Yeah, we considered having we didn't call it a proxy contract, but a proxy contract that would take out the debt initially. Yeah, okay, sure. Yes. I think maybe not for the MVP, but I think that's something to definitely consider that could improve the UX quite dramatically. Yeah. But yeah. Good work.
00:27:49.426 - 00:28:26.894, Speaker A: Thank you. On my side, I have to say, I'm a big fan of the watchful eye and Illuminati stuff. I really love the design. It's super fun. What will be my main advice is to the less you ask to the user, the better. So, for example, in the dashboard you ask for the position, but all this kind of stuff like the price, it changed all the time. And the better us is that the user initiates something and then forget about it because it just work in the background for him.
00:28:26.894 - 00:29:29.646, Speaker A: And all the information that you ask here are either available in the lending pool contract you have a view function, get user data that you can call anytime, and you can maybe run a script in the background that ask every x minute or whatever if the situation change and if some condition are met to enable some action. And also for the price, you have all the shining price feed contract. They are super easy to read as well and free to read as well. So I would recommend, if you have time, obviously that will be a major improvement if you just connect with your wallet and then everything is done on the background and you collect all the information without asking the user. Okay, yeah, we'll look into that. Go ahead. You want to give your last thought? We actually initially had a little bit of this is a dashboard.
00:29:29.646 - 00:29:54.730, Speaker A: We had a little view into the user data for the current user, but we ended up scrapping that because we just couldn't make it look like it fit initially. But we'll take a look at that again and see what else we can scrape from that. Super cool. Thank you. Thanks for presenting. Yes. Thanks, Trent.
00:29:54.730 - 00:30:22.850, Speaker A: All right, next up is audits are dead. Jack, do you want to go ahead and start? Hey, how's it going? Just generally really quick before you start, we have 13 projects. So if you can, we're going to try and condense a little bit more. Not saying to speed run your stuff, but just keep in mind that there are a bunch of projects that want to present. Go ahead. Cool. We'll try to get through it quickly.
00:30:22.850 - 00:30:45.238, Speaker A: I think Everett should be here as well. My teammate on this. I'm going to share my screen real quick. Hi, guys. And let me know if you don't see what I'm seeing. Okay, so our project is called Audits are dead. We're creating a new insurance protocol where basically we have a two sided insurance marketplace.
00:30:45.238 - 00:31:26.134, Speaker A: Projects on one side that pay a tiny percent of their total value locked to get insurance in case of a hack. And on the other side, we have stakers that get one of the highest yields in DeFi to kind of put up their capital in case one of these hacks happen. And I think maybe it's easiest to show you explain it from this side as well. So we have covered protocols. These are basically projects that we are covering. So we're covering Maker for $7 million of their TVL, covering Pydow for $3 million of their TVL. Total insurance outstanding claims is 15 million.
00:31:26.134 - 00:31:49.390, Speaker A: Potential outstanding claims is 15 million. And then pool strategies on the other side. So all that staker money we put into different strategies. So AV V Two, we put 6 million into that, and we get a yield from that on top of the fees that these protocols are paying us. And then to run you through quickly how it works. Basically, we've got the staking pool. As you can see, there's $10 million in it.
00:31:49.390 - 00:32:28.094, Speaker A: You're earning 7.46% right now, three day lockup. Let's do a quick example here where we put in. We'll call it a million die this, and you should be able to see you have a million dollars in there. Now. You start earning on it immediately, pool size grows, and we've got more locked value that is now backing these protocols. So that's the quick gist of it.
00:32:28.094 - 00:33:01.560, Speaker A: If Everett wants to add anything, go ahead. Otherwise, we'd love to hear your guys thoughts. Yeah, I love this project. I mean, from last week, the discussion we had, it's great to see it in action. Yeah, I think it's fantastic. The only feedback I have is that the allocation should be 100%. Are they that's a joke, but no, it's fine.
00:33:01.560 - 00:33:20.270, Speaker A: We'll get there. We want that too. I don't really have any other sort of feedback. Yeah. Mark or Nicola Marco. Okay. Yeah, look, it's pretty intuitive.
00:33:20.270 - 00:33:51.160, Speaker A: I mean, I heard the conversation last time. Basically, if I'm not mistaken, only the protocol themselves would be able to participate. Right. So it's a choice of a protocol, right? Exactly. So a lot of the insurance protocols right now sell to the consumer. We sell just to the protocol, and we go for big amounts of TVL, I guess. And we have an internal audit team that prices what we think that protocol should pay.
00:33:51.160 - 00:34:35.302, Speaker A: Okay. And since it's pretty quite technical, people right. It's not like DeFi users. It's really hardcore devs that would choose to go for this solution. I would disagree. But in terms of the strategies that you can deploy, who is going to decide them? And it's your input or that also sort of like a choice that every single protocol can decide where to put their stake at work. Yeah.
00:34:35.302 - 00:35:33.334, Speaker A: So the protocols aren't really staking. It's the average DeFi user that we want to stake, and they don't have to know anything about insurance or smart contract security. We kind of do the legwork for them on pricing the protocol insurance, and then they just see a yield and they just kind of put the money in and get the yield, and they don't need to worry about the smart contract security. And then to answer your question on the pool strategies, maybe Everett wants to talk a little bit about this, but it's kind of based on, I believe, how WYRN does it, where it kind of allocates to where the highest yield is at that time. So it's sort of an automated strategy that just tries to put people in the highest yield. Go ahead, Everett. A final user can actually stake their token or I didn't get that.
00:35:33.334 - 00:36:18.434, Speaker A: I thought that just the protocol themselves were sort of like ensuring the functioning, not the users. See what I mean? Yeah, sorry. Yeah. So the protocols are basically doing a deal with us and saying, hey, we want $100 million of total value locked insured. So we say, okay, we've got you for that 100 million. And then on the other side, it's average users coming in and staking money because they see a high yield and that's the pool of money is from users. And then the protocols aren't actually putting any money in, they're just getting covered for their hack risks.
00:36:18.434 - 00:36:44.880, Speaker A: I see. It's like an extra service that they offer to their users. Let's say we are affiliated with this insurance basically. Exactly. We think instead of getting a bunch of audits and paying money for that, they're just going to say, hey, look, all of your dollars are covered by this insurance. You don't need to worry about hacks anymore. And we think a lot more people want to go to those protocols that have insurance versus other ones.
00:36:44.880 - 00:37:15.714, Speaker A: Okay. Does the protocol give anything in return for this? The protocol pays a small percent of their total value locked, so they pay a small fee basically to get covered. And because it's like an under levered, you can see there's 15 million covered versus 11 million locked. Protocols are basically going to be paying an even smaller amount than they would if it was like one to one leverage or like one to one collateralization. And that adds to the yields of the stakers. Exactly. Contribution.
00:37:15.714 - 00:37:32.910, Speaker A: Exactly. Got it. Got you. All right, if there are any final comments, we're going to move on to the next project. Thanks for presenting, Jack. Cool. Thanks so much, guys.
00:37:32.910 - 00:38:22.830, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Derek, your project is free to go whenever you're ready. Hey, what's up, eater family? How are you guys? Everything okay? Yes. Okay, awesome. So I've been hacking with the governance protocol. First things first, I develop an ERC 721 that I can actually just punch, like the number 1500 or maybe unit number 100,000 or a million thousand because why am I doing this is because I believe that people here in Brazil suffer a lot because of document loss. And a lot of hacking happens here in Brazil, like the second country that's most hacked in the world.
00:38:22.830 - 00:39:01.530, Speaker A: So a lot of people lose their documents and lose their money. So I was thinking about actually just giving to the people blockchain ID where we could divide by district. So, for example, if you live in the northern part of Brazil, actually in my city, your district is from, I don't know, 500K all the way to one KK. There's like this little place where it's responsible for those IDs, and then southern part of the city is the same thing from one KK all the way to 0.5 KK. So just get this idea with me. It's very simple.
00:39:01.530 - 00:39:32.574, Speaker A: So there would be different districts around city where people would be giving out BRC 721. They would have the minter row. Okay. And all the minting would be done, like from, I don't. Know, from 07:00 A.m. Till 06:00 P.m.. After that, the hackers, the Minter roles would go into GitHub or actually any other platform that does JSON numbering, and they would just commit the numbering.
00:39:32.574 - 00:39:56.694, Speaker A: So I don't know if I registered 100 IDs. I will commit that to let me show you. Where is it? Here. Hey, Derek, real quick, can you just give us a one or two sentence summary of what the project is? Sure. Yeah. It's an ID 721 that we can use for voting. And I'm hacking with Normal.
00:39:56.694 - 00:40:35.160, Speaker A: ERC 721 from Open Zeppelin. And for now, I haven't been able to completely hack with the Governance 2.0, but I'm hacking with Web Two. So I'm actually using these ERC 721 to make votes. I changed the API. This is actually code that I hacked from Scaffold and I just changed it up so that it can actually be accepting ERC 721 instead of ERC 20. So this is like an ID that people can hold.
00:40:35.160 - 00:41:20.054, Speaker A: They can use it on their cell phones because MetaMask already captures your ERC 721. Let me show you guys. I actually showed this last week, but I'm going to show it again. So I've been testing this with Mumbai and we're good. And I'm going to start hacking this thing with Mumbai as well, basically validate all the votes of that ERC 721. It just runs validation, it goes into a Google form script and it gives me the winner. If people can have this ID around my city and later on we can get votes and do different democracy aspects of it.
00:41:20.054 - 00:42:07.590, Speaker A: We can actually bring global, actually not even global, but city like, and then maybe think about a better place where people can just be them themselves, choosing what they want. So in this case, Winning made a million votes with the same meter account. It's trying to do multiple votes, but it only has one token. This guy, he has his token and his daughter's token. And this other guy, he also has two tokens. So actually the cow is Winning by zero point. So I have to change this as well so that we can script it.
00:42:07.590 - 00:43:05.638, Speaker A: So I think that's that there's this code that I'm going to change it up here in the UI for. So it's very simple. Each place would have their own district and would be giving out not giving out, but selling out these ERC 721 and the participants can come into another DAP and use their ERC 721. So each week I think we can be making democratic changes in the city because we can expose different choices before actually putting up what we're going to be voting for. I actually like the idea of having a forum so structure forum, so people be choosing what they want, what the changes should be happening on the next month and things like that. And just up here. And we would have a validation of what's good to happen what should happen.
00:43:05.638 - 00:44:04.278, Speaker A: And I really think this system is incredible for businesses. So not just having it as a global ID, but maybe an industry with 1000 workers mint their IDs and the business can actually be creating and creating ideas like what are we going to eat next Friday? Like lasagna or parmigiana or spaghetti meatballs. And create a where their votes are secret and it's all captured in a Google form. Yeah, using Zapier real quick. Yeah, sure. Who is eligible to create votes? Only people have ERC 721 so you have to have this specific ERC 721. So it's hardwired to the abi and hardwired to the number of the contract.
00:44:04.278 - 00:45:02.586, Speaker A: So this is all working up on and then you and then you said votes are secret. How does that happen? Well, you come in, you vote. Right? So let's say I just sign up for let me see the account I'm using here, give me 1 second. No, I'm just curious how votes would actually be secret if it's all stored on chain. Well, right now I just voted on the cowgan so I can actually use this hash and blow it up and I can actually find the user. But since we're talking about decentralized, we don't know who's in the back of the car, we don't know who's the owner of the wallet. It's pseudonymous so I can still link it to an address, right? Yeah, you could probably go all the way and follow it up to the address.
00:45:02.586 - 00:46:08.610, Speaker A: This Google form, the only person that can actually be seen is the centralized in this case like example of a business, the boss and probably the tech engineer, where they're actually applying this in the system to join the business and create a dynamic with the users as well as for democratic votes or for city things. It would also be this centralized system that could actually validate these votes and that's where it comes actually the user and the business where you're like okay business, I believe in you. So you're not going to be going all the way hashing to see who I am. And even if I did that, it would probably be impossible to actually discover who that person is. Although she does have a Terra ID, in this case, the Terra ID does have certain annotations. So come on internet, charge up. So it has all the specifics of that person voting.
00:46:08.610 - 00:46:55.460, Speaker A: So the person wouldn't see this vote, she wouldn't be able to see the vote because the system would see it. But if I went all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way, yeah. I could certainly find out that this guy voted for the know. Okay, gotcha. Yeah, that's good context. David or Nicola, Mark, do you guys want to jump in with any quick feedback here about the presentation or app itself? Hello Derek, do you know about existing voting systems such as hang on Porton, we're going to go with the Ave team first because they set aside some time to be here. I just want to get the feedback from David and Nicola first.
00:46:55.460 - 00:47:18.440, Speaker A: I'm answering to Derek. Derek, do you know about existing voting systems, aragon and DAOstack, for example? No, I don't know about them. I'm just even googling. Yeah, you can continue. Master. Victor. Victor, I had to mute you.
00:47:18.440 - 00:47:41.134, Speaker A: We're going to stick with the structure of this event. Sorry I had to mute you, but David or to we're going to head back to you guys. Victor, if you want to connect with Derek, you're more than welcome to outside of the call, but David, go ahead. Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the presentation, Derek. It's interesting, but to be honest, it was a bit confusing for me.
00:47:41.134 - 00:48:21.238, Speaker A: So I think the feedback for the pitch would be try and make a one to two sentence explanation of what you're building and then build the narrative around there because it seemed to be going into all these different directions. And then I see emojis of cows and cats and then something about voting, something about secret voting and some other things like that. And then I see some windows. I see you have League of Legends. Open screen is a bit distracting as well, so there's a lot of stuff happening. So maybe that would be my feedback on the pitch side. Yeah, just try and maybe have a clearer narrative.
00:48:21.238 - 00:49:00.478, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll follow with David similar feedback. Basically, it was a little bit hard to follow. My bad. Maybe I didn't have a lot of context, but exactly like David said, start with the core, because it seems to me that know a tool or a protocol that could be applicable for many different use cases. So start with the very basics and then broaden the discussion on you could do ABCDE, and the use cases are ABCDE, but at least the recipient understands the core, and then the brainstorming can start. Thanks a lot, Ms.
00:49:00.478 - 00:49:40.840, Speaker A: Nicola. Thanks a lot, Mr. David. Of course, Mark. Unless you have anything, I was just going to say yeah, I know this was like a demo focused session, but it was a little hard to even though I've already seen your presentation last week, I can understand somebody coming in fresh like Nicola might be a little hard to understand what the project is about. So just be able, know, construct a framework of how you're thinking about this before jumping into the app or just explain it a little bit better. Maybe we can work on that.
00:49:40.840 - 00:50:02.510, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, guys, and sorry about the League of Legends. That's not actually hoping, it's just my know no worries. Mark, do you want to add anything or if not no, I think it was pretty summed up by David and Nicole. Okay, great. Thanks, Derek. Thank you, guys. Bye bye.
00:50:02.510 - 00:50:35.494, Speaker A: Victor. Yes? Would you like to present your project? Thank you. I should present only changes compared to the previous presentation. Previous demo session or from the beginning? Beginning. I think if you want to, just give a quick intro to what you've done previously and then any changes. But just remember that there are other people. So we have to keep these sessions a little shorter than I'd like.
00:50:35.494 - 00:50:57.466, Speaker A: I wish we could spend 20 minutes on each person, but just try to keep it as brief as possible. Thank you. The changes in the app are not impressive. This is the app for anyone to receive a salary for common goods. Anyone can register for a salary. I'm registering myself now. I have a salary.
00:50:57.466 - 00:51:19.878, Speaker A: One token every second. I can withdraw at any moment. Sorry, I'm withdrawing. It appears on my account, et cetera. Anyone can donate n ETH one, one five in the future, seven to one, et cetera. I won't show it. It's not interesting.
00:51:19.878 - 00:51:54.638, Speaker A: Main changes in the app are new testnet and connection through different providers than MetaMask. It has also a Gitcoin version that I submitted to Gitcoin for testing. It's the same app, but on Gitcoin with their datebase to store the condition ID. Condition ID is here. I'm the first user in this test. So my main thing I did sorry, it's something wrong network. Yes, I have a wrong network.
00:51:54.638 - 00:52:10.566, Speaker A: I'm switching the network. It's in Kubai. It does not work. Sorry, it's not my bug. Adam does not work. It's not my bug. Now it works.
00:52:10.566 - 00:52:39.070, Speaker A: So I created also related to this project request your wallet or funds. We choose a date and any ethereum address. Click Request it does not work yet. Or cancel bequest. It will be a button to bequest to this project, to this future salaries. Here is bequest all funds on Acknowledge safe smart Wallet. It does not work yet.
00:52:39.070 - 00:53:02.230, Speaker A: I'm now working to make it work directly in Gnoshis. Now to explain how it works internally. It's the most interesting thing or I have said already enough for this demo. Okay, great. Yeah. So it's good to see you. You have made progress since last week, but for the other people who weren't here last week.
00:53:02.230 - 00:53:40.610, Speaker A: So I think I can summarize what Victor is working on. It's a way to distribute funds or time lock funds for streaming into the future. So people can lock up funds or bequest them. And then you can benefit from the future. And I believe you're intending to support scientists as the first use case, right? Scientists, free software developers. It may work also for journalists, et cetera. Carbon accounters may receive salaries or carbon accounting companies, et cetera.
00:53:40.610 - 00:54:33.902, Speaker A: In fact, any kinds of common goods that can be accounted well enough. And this system, all those should pay money to search engines to create oracles who will finally decide who gets finding like this explained very short. It has many details like that. It creates a new token at every transfer away from the salary recipient account. Lost accounts can be restored, et cetera. Does every new bequest get a new contract instantiation or are these all routed through the same contract? It's all the same contract. The same contract has any number of Condition IDs.
00:54:33.902 - 00:55:10.190, Speaker A: For example, I'm a scientist with a condition ID. This is condition ID and any number of oracles. Oracles. The first Oracle may be the Oracle that distributes money between other Oracles by global voting. There can be many related and unrelated Oracles. An Oracle can be in a sense sub Oracle of another Oracle. So the global Dow will distribute funds between Oracles, can be search engines, et cetera.
00:55:10.190 - 00:55:51.322, Speaker A: Okay, Condition ID, does that mean is that just the user ID? User ID is seller recipient is this Condition ID is number of a project. It may be enough to have one Condition ID per user, but nudge prevents a user to create more than one. Okay, so maybe I would call it not Condition ID but Project ID or something that's a little more obvious. I'm not sure. It's condition. ID. Technically Condition ID, there is a concept of condition in prediction markets that are used internally.
00:55:51.322 - 00:57:01.138, Speaker A: So maybe right name is indeed Condition ID, but Project ID would be a good name too. Yeah, just Condition doesn't really tell me what it's actually referring to. I've talked too much so I'm going to let Nicola or some of the Ave guys jump in if they have any feedback, maybe I can start, I'll be very quick. Look, I think that the core idea could have several applications. We have seen actually several projects doing some proper products around this one problem that they occurred at some point and I can give the feedback was basically the gas cost was too high to make those tranche payments in a sense. Right, but the low hanging fruit would be sort of like subscription payments or I mean you started with salary and donation, which makes a lot of sense. But also think about a business that wants to receive that sort of money on a length of time.
00:57:01.138 - 00:57:33.886, Speaker A: So that could be also one extension of the project. First, there is no such trouble. We can withdraw, for example, once a month. It's not required to withdraw often tokens are received every second, but it does not use any gas. They are just counted without gas. And using for business, maybe for science or for climate, it makes sense to look for 50 or 100 years for business. It may make sense to look for two years, for five years.
00:57:33.886 - 00:58:16.298, Speaker A: So we can just create a different Oracle and use it for more usual business. It's not the main intended use, but it is an important additional use to use it for financing startups. Got it. Thank you. Thank you very much for what you built so far and can wait to see what you will be in the remaining time. The idea is very close to Sabli, which is already in the ecosystem. So I invite you to check what they do, maybe to take some inspiration or things like that.
00:58:16.298 - 00:59:13.600, Speaker A: I think that's a killer use case when we get that you can build on layer ones, but that will be so incredible on layer two when we solve the transaction fee and gas cost for this kind of interaction. My advice in terms of feature it will be for use case super useful. For example, the Diceo model that was explained a couple of years ago by Vitalik Buterin so you can have like daisy autonomy. So that's the mix like Vitarin Buterin wrote in 2018 a cool research paper on daiko. To be honest, I understand no word. Trent just wrote that in the chat. So you can google that and you will find the Vitalikutarin article about it.
00:59:13.600 - 01:00:10.206, Speaker A: I put it in the chat dice. So basically Diceo are a way to raise and then distribute money from decentralized entity. And he described the Tap method that is very close to what you are building where you can allocate for x amount of time, y amount of funds. With the rate that you decide on this, that will be like a cool use case. Donation as well, subscription as well, all these kind of things. One cool feature will be to have tranche of payments. Because usually when there's a project that starts, let's say you agree to have 2000 die for a project, maybe the people that are working on this project, maybe they need 500 die now to cover their cost and start the work.
01:00:10.206 - 01:00:52.842, Speaker A: And then they will be more than happy to have 1500 die on the scale of three months, for example, or whatever amount of time. So having associated to milestone the ability to do batch payments in one go or have some kind of payment curve that it's just not linear. That will have implication for the project, that will be super useful. To be honest, I don't understand you. Would you send to my email? My English isn't very good, I just didn't understand you. I understand some words, but not all. It's okay, we can talk in a written form on discord.
01:00:52.842 - 01:01:20.390, Speaker A: We are more than happy to support you directly in the discord. All right. Thanks, Mark. Yeah. Victor? If you don't connect to them, I can relay some of that information as well. I think the big part of what Mark was saying was it's definitely a really compelling use case time lock payments or streaming payments. So there's definitely demand for these kinds of projects.
01:01:20.390 - 01:02:08.050, Speaker A: David, did you have any comments? If not, we can wrap up just one bit of feedback. Victor? I think one area you could approve for the interface is that there's a lot of information there that's not necessarily, you know, Trent's comment about the like it might be technically accurate to call it that, but then from a user perspective, they don't need to know about what it's normally called in prediction markets. Just call it that. Project ID. I also noticed the time stamps you had, you had including the timestamps, are really huge, including seconds and time zones. So you don't really need that information. So I think if you clean up the UI a bit, it could make it just a lot more effective and easier for someone to look at initially.
01:02:08.050 - 01:02:33.846, Speaker A: I think that would be helpful. I don't think it's terrible because it's just to look to register once and then work. It does not influence usability. It's just feedback, Victor. So take it or leave it. It's just feedback. Yeah.
01:02:33.846 - 01:03:02.226, Speaker A: I was actually going to echo David's comment. There's a lot of information, like, some of it's needed at the beginning, but maybe not all of it right away. So take this as a suggestion from both of us. Maybe either simplify some of it or work on the balance of what information you present right away and then what you present afterwards. I think that's all I have, though. Okay. Thanks for presenting Victor.
01:03:02.226 - 01:03:30.400, Speaker A: Next up is Malice Warren. Do you want to go ahead and present? Hello, Warren. Are you Lisa? Warren? Okay. There you go. I see a Warren popping up. You want to go ahead and share? Yeah, sure. Let me go to share.
01:03:30.400 - 01:05:08.366, Speaker A: Okay, so let me just mention two things. First, this is a project that I've been researching for the last six months, right? But I think I did already discuss with Trent about that. I already started researching this project, and this is my last semester in university studying computer science. So basically, the whole idea of this project, what I was trying to figure out is, is there a way for us to have peer to peer cash back within the ecosystem? Because recently I've been noticing a lot of companies have been offering cards with cashbacks. And I think one of the dangers that most people don't realize is that you have to really trust these entities with your funds to receive these cash backs. And recently, I don't know if you guys remember, we saw recently where some of these companies want you to stake, and then the price of what they ask you to stake, it crashes severely. And then this is something I was looking into.
01:05:08.366 - 01:06:32.220, Speaker A: If there's a way we could have, like, a peer to peer cash back system. Basically, the whole concept of this idea is that I see a way basically, all of these are smart contracts, right? And they can be deployed by they can be deployed by anybody, right? And basically think of each one of these contracts as a store. Each one of these are a store, right. Basically the way this would work. Right. And I kind of built off this idea that MakerDAO has where you actually stake in the beginning stages, where they actually stake ether as collateral and dies produced. I started saying to myself, if there is such a way where ether could be staked, right? And as collateral for something that would be produced as essentially cash back.
01:06:32.220 - 01:08:42.334, Speaker A: For example, right now I have a rate of like 7% cash back, right? So let's say, for example, I'm running my store, right? And I have my assets right here, right? I have ether, right? And I could stake, right? So if I stake, let's say, $70 worth of ether, right? And somebody comes to my store, right? So basically up to $1,000 could be spent, right? When this money is spent after the merchant or whosoever stakes the $70, it would be locked up as collateral, right? It would be locked up as collateral. And basically it could only be released back if a customer comes back with that token, right? So that token that would be produced would basically I would call it Fruit, right? But when the ether is locked up as collateral, the thing that you have to remember is that the Fruit, it can't only be used at one specific location. So it could be used at a variety of different locations. You could search and see where it is. So, for example, anybody could set up a store, right? And one of the main things I was thinking about to distinguish stores differently and people haven't been paying much attention using it a lot is probably ENS names. I think it's one of the best ways to probably distinguish. So for example, let's say I have an ice cream stand at XYZ location, right? And I bought the ENS.
01:08:42.334 - 01:09:46.150, Speaker A: Name ice cream eat right. I could create subdomains of that ENS name to define probably different locations of where I would actually have these locations, right? So at the initial stages when you deploy one of these so right now I have a lot deployed with this account. I could probably switch to a different warren, can I jump in really quick? Sure. Yeah. So I'm just going to summarize what I've heard so far and you tell me if this is correct. So what you have is a way for stores or establishments or somebody who's selling a good can create an account and then users or customers can stake ETH, let's say, to that account. And then in return they'll get something akin to a loyalty point which you're calling Fruit and then that can be spent at other locations.
01:09:46.150 - 01:11:14.500, Speaker A: Yes. But the thing is, it's not the customer that would stake, right? It would actually be the merchant. And the thing is, there is no sign up required, right? All you need is just a MetaMask extension or any browser wallet, right, and you could just deploy one of these contracts, right? Each one is designed in such a way where right. And remember, it could be anybody. The best thing about it is that it doesn't even have to be a merchant, right? It could also be a customer that just want anybody could deploy one of these, right? You deploy it, you lock up an amount of ether, right? The amount of ether you locked up, that's the amount of collateral you could basically produce. So this could be used in a variety of different ways. Because instead of like, for example, if you think of the situation that's going on right now, where a lot of businesses where a lot of stores are closed and out of business, if something like this was in place where, for example, you were previously running one of these stores right? And let's say you had a lot of collateral, right? You could do things like buy and sell collateral with different stores, right.
01:11:14.500 - 01:12:31.690, Speaker A: And then customers could find if a customer can't really find locations to where they could actually sell, where they could actually use these tokens, they could also buy collateral and use the tokens they have to release back at a cheaper rate, right. If that's making any sense. Another thing that I've been researching, so I've read three different research papers that Vitalik wrote. So a lot of DeFi projects are kind of like scared of sharding with how contracts would be called. Because with sharding, you would have to do things such as yanking with this. In terms of the research that I did, this would be able to work across all shards, right? So across all shards, you would have one set of stores, right. And basically what would be moving across the shards is actually the token that is produced when somebody actually buys something.
01:12:31.690 - 01:13:08.822, Speaker A: Right, okay, got you. Can you go back to just the main page and then I'll open it up to the rest of the from here, right. Basically, hang on. What I have right here is like a verified hang on 1 second. So when you jump into this page, is there anywhere where I can see the summary of what the project is or a quick intro for a new user coming in? Does that exist anywhere? No, that would be like the welcome page, right? Yeah. There's not a welcome page right now at the moment. Right.
01:13:08.822 - 01:13:42.770, Speaker A: But I imagine it as something like saying with 7% cash back, no cards acquired. Right. That would be like something on the main page. Right. What I have right here, each one of these cells or stores, they're smart contracts, right. But there are a lot of things I had to take in consideration when designing something like this. Because each contract the first design that I have, the contract size was too large.
01:13:42.770 - 01:14:15.470, Speaker A: I reduced it probably by ten times, because at the current stages, we are not in a sharded network as yet. Right. But this could actually work in the current ecosystem we have right now. Right. I reduced it to somewhere below about 2800 KB for each contract. Right. Another thing that I take into consideration for each contract is that they're recyclable.
01:14:15.470 - 01:15:10.874, Speaker A: If you go right here, you could change the owner, right. They're recyclable, so you're not wasting memory. And there would be incentives for you to actually recycle these. And that could actually be used in terms of privacy issues. So, for example, this contract with this address, it could be used, for example, today by somebody in Argentina and if they want to change it to somebody in London the next day. So that's another thing that I took into consideration, is that the memory is not wasted. You're actually recycled at the same time when you hover over each one of these cells.
01:15:10.874 - 01:16:12.830, Speaker A: Right? You see, I put like this defining thing at the bottom that shows the available funds, the collateral, the stake, and the collateral relief that's inside of each store. The collateral relief is basically you're saying that you want to buy collateral from a different store, right. And you set a rate that you want to buy that collateral at. So if I have some collateral and I want to sell it, I would be selling it at a loss. And then there are a variety of different reasons why I might would want to do that. For example, I'm not getting enough customers to come back with those tokens to release back that collateral so I could get back the ether, right? And finally, one last thing I took into consideration is this thing called extensions. So an extension is basically a contract that could be applied to each store individually.
01:16:12.830 - 01:17:17.202, Speaker A: And this could basically anybody could write any type of extension to interact with different DeFi protocols right now. So I had to reengineer the ENS subgraph, and along with the subgraph that I created with this recently, it's currently deployed on the graph protocol. It's working fine so far. The contracts are currently working fine. I'm still working on the client, but so far everything seems to be fine. But the way I hey, Warren, I'm just going to jump in really quick because we've gone for, I think about ten minutes now. One thing that just for me, I don't know about the others, but for me personally, I think you could do some work on improving how you explain the concept.
01:17:17.202 - 01:18:06.966, Speaker A: When you make your video next week, obviously, you're only going to have four minutes to explain and demo your concept. So sure, there will be a little intro where you say very concisely, this is what this project does. I can definitely see that. You said you put six months of research into this, which is great, and you have a lot of concepts which you're trying to put into here. But for me personally, I think it could be clearer or you could maybe boil it down into the key things that you're trying to do, like what's the main idea that you want to get across that there are these stores that you can register and then somehow get collateral out of? It's unclear to me what they actually do is it deposited. Into Ave or some other yield producing facility. These are things it's unclear to me.
01:18:06.966 - 01:18:52.626, Speaker A: Now, I have a rough idea, but it's not entirely clear what these things actually do and I'm going to just open it up to questions because we spent quite a bit of time not to cut you off, but we do have to get to the other few other wrap. So David, do you want to give any feedback about the explanation or how he presented the project? I think, Nicola, you unmuted so you can go first. Oh, sure. Look, I just resonate completely with Trent. I understand, Warren. There's a lot to unpack. There's been a lot of thinking behind, but especially because next week is going to be four minutes, you need to find a way to start from the basic and 30 seconds, maximum 1 minute.
01:18:52.626 - 01:19:40.598, Speaker A: You need to convey the message. And I think that's going to be very helpful for any traction, any good market strategy you want to have, any conversation you don't want to have the people that are actually going to use it. Right, so start with the basic and then build from that and can have a conversation. But that's all for now. Sure, yeah. Just I guess adding on top of that, I think Warren, you're obviously like a really intelligent guy and I think that the UI is quite polished, so it looks really nice. I think the thing with us developers and engineers is that sometimes we get too excited with the underlying technology and all the little bits and pieces and efficiencies that we did and all the little hacks that we did to get to that point.
01:19:40.598 - 01:20:36.534, Speaker A: But in the end, especially for hackathons like this, people, at least the consumer doesn't really care about that. What they care about is what's the problem and how are you solving that? So I think if you focus the demo on those things, I think it would make it a lot clearer and then later on in somewhere else, you can talk about all the technical details, but really it's just like, how do you solve their problem? I think that would be it. Okay, got it. I have just one last thing to add, is that I think the idea of recycling contract and maybe resell it for second end market is just genius because of the gas price. For example, CDPs that are now called Vault on Mechadao, they are pretty expensive to create but not that expensive to deposit interaction with it. So if they keep pushing on that ID because I think there's a market for that. Yes.
01:20:36.534 - 01:21:31.850, Speaker A: Thank you. So, to summarize, I think we're all on the same page of like there's a ton of stuff that you've built into this, but we need to see a little bit of a clearer, more concise explanation for the core features are so basically just the core general concept. So if next week I just showed a concept where I staked and then I send Ether and then what I staked is locked up as collateral. And then the tokens that I received after I sent Ether as purchase. Right. And then I send it back and the collateral is released back to the merchant. Would that be a good concept to demonstrate how the project actually works? Yeah, and if you can pair it with some sort of graphic that just shows the flow of funds or how the contracts are structured.
01:21:31.850 - 01:22:07.198, Speaker A: Not like a, UML, diagram or something complicated, just like a very straightforward diagram of the interaction between customers or users and the owners of the store, that would be perfect. Don't mention anything about Sharding. Even if it is, like, a really impressive concept, we don't have to worry about yanking contracts for a while. So, like a simple white paper, like, outlining showing some details, the general concept of it. Yeah. And this is specifically for your video just because, like I said, you have a lot going on, so you want to make sure you distill it down to your core. Core ideas.
01:22:07.198 - 01:22:17.282, Speaker A: Yeah. Not even a white paper. Think of it like the abstract of the white you. Thank you. Cool. All right. Thank you for sharing that, Warren.
01:22:17.282 - 01:22:34.970, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Thank you. We're going to move on to not real, if they are ready. Hopefully they are. We have about five minutes left. So again, we'll try to get this last one in before David, Mark and OK. I love this project.
01:22:34.970 - 01:23:06.082, Speaker A: Defcats. All right, go ahead, start it off. Okay. Hi, everyone. So my project is basically centered around AI generated art, and the idea that AI generated art is this infinite space. And it would be very cool to add a price discovery mechanism on top of that, which would be this trading marketplace. So I've been working on this for a while, but I have also started on something new during the hackathon.
01:23:06.082 - 01:24:02.202, Speaker A: So, just full disclosure, I didn't build all of this during the hackathon, but the landing page gives you a good idea of what's going on. So there's a fixed supply that's minted every day with rolling auctions. And then also, just because we're minting and selling something out of nowhere, I thought it was only fair to give some of that to charity. So that's all going to be part of it. So this is the auction interface, which is what I was basically completing, or only partially done when the hackathon started. And this hackathon gave me a lot of motivation to complete it. So basically, these are the rolling auctions and this current user, they have won an auction here, which they have to unwrap by making a contract call.
01:24:02.202 - 01:25:11.760, Speaker A: And basically it's just a standard English auction that takes up and the auctions last for 24 hours. And once I joined this hackathon, I had some new ideas about how I could integrate DFI. So I would love to get some feedback on that. So one thing is that the bids that are locked up in the auction that are locked up in the contract might as well be staked in Ave. So that's one interesting way to get a little bit of return that would probably just go but it would just be ethereum. So that'd be just like 1% per year or something. But then also had this other idea that 50% of what you pay for the NFT would actually be staked in Ave so that you actually get return upon purchasing the NFT which would incentivize holding and take some supply off the market.
01:25:11.760 - 01:26:00.990, Speaker A: And yeah, I mean those are basically my ideas of how to integrate Aave. It's using the graph protocol for some data which was awesome. Another thing that was inspired by this hackathon and yeah, that's basically where I'm at with it. So I have this auction interface basically done and next step is I'm integrating Aave into it. Nice. It sounds like Mark is a big fan of cats, so I think you should take the lead. Yeah, I think the NFT market is like the next big thing, especially when it's DeFi bold.
01:26:00.990 - 01:26:43.580, Speaker A: I have no bad feedback to give basically. So a good project. Keep working on it. Thank you. If you have anything David or I can go ahead up to mean I'm a bit of an NFT hater, but I think integrating something like Aave where the NFT has some sort of value I think makes sense. So what you said about half of the purchase price goes to Aave and that sort of underlies the value. I think that's a good thing.
01:26:43.580 - 01:27:16.120, Speaker A: But besides that, it's probably not my really area of expertise NFTs at the moment. Good stuff. Look, I think it's the right time to develop something like that and market timing is actually something can really help you. So it's a platform but there is a component of creation and a component of trading and marketplace. Correct. Right. It's both of them.
01:27:16.120 - 01:27:55.090, Speaker A: It's mainly curation actually at this time. Yeah. The platform right now is creating all the AI generated art up front. I would love to turn it into like a creator's platform down the line. It's just out of scope for the first version. Okay, yeah maybe. Of course if it's going to be a final product and something where final user lends to as a page, maybe have a little bit more clarity of what could be done and a little bit more friendly in terms of like I would be a little bit lost if I just see this.
01:27:55.090 - 01:28:28.400, Speaker A: Right, so maybe that's the only feedback on that guide a little bit the user into the experience, but good work for the rest. Thank you. I wanted to show you guys some other Aigenerate art real quick just to show you some of the possibilities. So this is a Koi model that I'm working on which is just kind of interesting. And then this is watercolor, flowers. It's just cool stuff. That's why I love working on this project.
01:28:28.400 - 01:29:29.194, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Sorry, question. Who trains the models? Who creates the generates the art? Yeah, that's all the platform, or me at this time. So I'm training the models and just like, pre minting, basically, all these NFDS, maybe not for the first version, but for later versions. It'll be interesting if you had some sort of decentralized training of the models or creating the artwork and then that's sort of like a proof of work that is actual, like someone's dedicated compute resources to create this AI art that might help underlie some value. And probably that's not in the scope of the Academy, given the available time. But most NFT projects like Avigotchi Comet OpenSea, rare Bolt they all move to the scalability side chain of matic.
01:29:29.194 - 01:30:13.760, Speaker A: Right? Maybe. And the main reason for that is to ease up on the cost of minting and transferring NFTs. So maybe that's some pathway you want to so the having not used at Matic is the friction of moving funds between Matic. Is that a blocker for users? Do you have any they have bridges, so I'm not an expert on Matic, I have to confess. But they have bridges. I'm not aware for, ERC, like, NFTs, but they have, like for regular, ERC, 20. They have a lot cool.
01:30:13.760 - 01:30:48.970, Speaker A: Yeah. It's not too hard to move assets between L two S, but I think also you asked about having more like DFI integrations. Maybe one obvious one is obviously follow the, ERC, I think seven, two, one standard. So then eventually, if someone buys this, they can also sell on Openc or sell on the secondary markets as well. I think there'll probably be like some park collateral markets in the future as well. It is, ERC, seven, two, one. Very cool.
01:30:48.970 - 01:31:17.266, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Appreciate it, everyone. Right. Thanks for presenting Notreal AI. We are actually at 1130 Eastern or past it. So I want to thank Mark, David and Nicola for jumping on and giving feedback to team. I think they probably have some other things going on or they're heading to their evening Europe, so I'm going to let them go.
01:31:17.266 - 01:31:36.458, Speaker A: Unless they're more than welcome to stay on, of course. But just want to say thanks for giving feedback to the team so far. Thank you very much. I'm really sorry. Can you give me just for five minutes? I'm really sorry. Because we worked all the week but nobody listened to us. Please give me another I can stay up for five minutes.
01:31:36.458 - 01:31:55.534, Speaker A: Okay. Really? Because last week also nobody listened. So please? Yeah, absolutely. I'll stay on, no problem. Me too. Don't worry about it. Did you there are, like eight other teams that probably would also love feedback from David and Nicola.
01:31:55.534 - 01:32:27.046, Speaker A: So I don't know if it's quite fair for you just to jump in. Yeah, you're jumping the line. Okay, Trent, let's go. I will wait. This isn't a personal thing, I'm just saying like, there are seven other teams ahead of you that would probably love to get feedback from David and Nicola, but I can't obligate them to stay for another hour. Please remember, we are accessible basically all the time. We don't answer right away because we are based in Europe.
01:32:27.046 - 01:33:22.560, Speaker A: And if that's not your time zone, maybe you would have to wait a little bit for an answer. But you can always contact us on Discord and we would be more than happy to. Yeah, maybe next week, Trent, as well. Maybe think about just flipping the order of this to all the people that are at the bottom now. Maybe they can go first or something like that next week. Yeah, that's a good idea. Bogdan, did you reach out on Discord to any of the teams or were you not able to get in contact with them? Yes, of course we are on Discord, but I thought that today's meeting is to show what we did last week and I can show it now, right? Yes, but yeah, there's a list of projects who have signed up so I don't know if I can just jump ahead of all those people.
01:33:22.560 - 01:34:00.600, Speaker A: So we had to do it in like there were people who sat through this whole session and added their names on the Google Doc. So I think we're just going to keep going on that list. I'm going to stay around. I'm just switching off and waiting for you to call me. Okay. David, Mark, Nicola, are you going to stick around? Yeah, I can stick around at least another 25 minutes. Okay, perfect.
01:34:00.600 - 01:34:26.738, Speaker A: I'll stay for one more and then I got to head off. Okay, great. Then we'll keep going on the list. And the next one up is Fuji Boyan, if you want to start presenting. Yeah. Hi guys, thanks for having us. So just a quick overview of our project.
01:34:26.738 - 01:35:33.570, Speaker A: It's called Fuji and it optimizes borrowing rates for pool of loans by constantly refinancing for the best rates on the market. What I mean, there are different borrowing rates proposed by different providers. Ave GX and our protocol. Our protocol. So in that case, it's a market where we can borrow Dai by supplying it. So people are supplying the collateral, borrowing Dai I and receiving for that debt tokens. They're much like the Ave debt tokens, they're just a fork of it and how we are optimizing for the best rates.
01:35:33.570 - 01:36:34.780, Speaker A: Like there is a controller which checks constantly where the best rates on the market. And if there is a better opportunity on the market by flash loan, it switches the collateral and the borrow from one provider to the other. Like that. People who borrowed, who borrowed here. So they pay less interest for their loans. So this is the core idea and we come up with prototype with the UI prototype. So here is the home screen.
01:36:34.780 - 01:37:26.406, Speaker A: It's just a figma prototype. It's not browser front end app yet. So here is the home page. We connect a wallet by now we can just borrow Dai but we can imagine in the future that we can borrow more currencies and supply more other collateral than it. So we go to borrow some die. We want to borrow 100 die. Here we can see which is the provider that we are currently using in real time, like which one is supplying the best rates.
01:37:26.406 - 01:38:52.562, Speaker A: We get a quote and here we see for example some estimation of the debt we are going to pay in one month, three month, one year and the interest that is going to be saved for this amount. So we click borrow, we approve and here we get our 100 die in our wallet plus our debt tokens. So here is the stage at which we are right now. It that's very good. There's a lot of lending and supply side aggregator out there but almost not borrow side in order to optimize the borrowing cost of having position on DeFi and the fact that to the best of my knowledge or from my understanding of what you are building at Fuji, you can batch the loan position. So users basically deposit their assets and their collateral inside the contract and the contract borrow on their behalf in order to batch the action and reduce the operational cost of operating. Those interaction is like super useful.
01:38:52.562 - 01:39:39.398, Speaker A: And I see a lot of users that would be interest to use these kind of services. Yeah, it's exactly to repay you will use flash loan, right? In order to swap full position from one protocol to the other, right? Yes, exactly. Here, when we spot a better opportunity, we do a Flash loan by repaying and borrowing again from the other supplier. Yeah, that's impressive. Since the time constraint. I'll be quick and it's very interesting. I see a lot of market as well.
01:39:39.398 - 01:40:09.120, Speaker A: It's something we have actually thought about it either as an integration on top of our existing protocol or as a standalone product. So keep asking, that's the good direction for sure. Thank you. Yeah, agree. Very good idea. I'll be interested to see how you actually implement it in code because that'll be quite fascinating. But yeah, so far it's a very good idea.
01:40:09.120 - 01:40:56.894, Speaker A: Okay. Basically really clear and targeted use case as well, which is good. Yeah, basically for the tracking positions of users to our vote, we are using Ave debt token standard. So it's just kind of partial fork of Ave. Yeah, very cool. Thank you. Anything else for boyan? Yeah, I appreciate the very clear diagram that shows the flow of things.
01:40:56.894 - 01:41:41.514, Speaker A: Maybe this is just my bias, but something that's really helpful for me to understand projects. You've been working on these things for a couple of weeks now, so explaining that graphically is sometimes helpful at least for me. I'm assuming this is going to be hooked up to contracts for submission. Sorry, you have a figma mockup, but will this actually be hooked up to sure, sure. Yes. We are actively working also on the smart contracts, and the idea will be if we manage to put all this together by the end of the next week. Got you.
01:41:41.514 - 01:42:01.282, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. That's great. Okay, we're going to move on to the next project. And remember, anybody who has questions or they feel like they didn't get sufficient feedback, the Discord is perfect for these kinds of asynchronous feedback types. You doesn't have to be on a call. You can take screenshots of your project.
01:42:01.282 - 01:42:22.774, Speaker A: There's a UI channel. All of the sponsors are in Discord and are responsive there. If they're not, please let me know or Emily know and we'll reach out to them. But there should be ways to get feedback other than this live session. We're going to keep going. I just got to bounce now. That's totally fine.
01:42:22.774 - 01:42:30.538, Speaker A: Yeah. Appreciate you joining. Giving feedback again this week. That's right. Thanks for having me. Enjoy, everyone. Great work.
01:42:30.538 - 01:42:51.518, Speaker A: See you, David. Bye bye. All right, Mark, are you sticking around as well? Yeah, I think I have time for one more. Okay, appreciate it. So Mark and Nicola. This is Blossom with Chris, H, JNC and Priyanka. I'll let you guys start presenting.
01:42:51.518 - 01:43:01.830, Speaker A: Yeah. First, thanks for staying around. Sticking around for us. So we're Team Blossom. Can everyone hear? Yes. Yes. Awesome.
01:43:01.830 - 01:44:04.374, Speaker A: Yeah. So what we're doing is effectively patreon for Ethereum. So what we're doing is we want a way for fans to be able to fund the creators and have creators be able to share a link where fans are able to fund those creators. And on the creator side, we're taking the donations from fans and sticking them into Ave and grabbing eight tokens so that they generate yield and they don't have to do anything, even if they're not super familiar with crypto. They just need to share their link and their fans are able to send them Ethereum or USDC, and we'll take care of the conversions. So here we have our links. Say one of our teammates is actually a rapper, so we can pretend that he's sending a link to his fans.
01:44:04.374 - 01:44:41.160, Speaker A: If we click the copy button, we'll grab a link. I'm just going to use one of our BOOKMARKS for that. Say a fan clicks this link that our teammates sent. We connect our wallet. We'll send, like, one Ethereum because they're feeling extremely generous today. We click send. We click Send and something's not working.
01:44:41.160 - 01:45:32.200, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Essentially, well, we don't have the smart contract ready, but it would send it and the creator would receive the eight tokens in the end, and they would just generate yield on it and the creator would see their balance and then cash it out. Yeah. Basically our idea was we have this balance here with aUSDC, but we also want to have the opportunity to let this donation grow over time. So it's not just, oh, fans send money through e to the creator, it's that they send money and this grows. So it's almost like the gift that keeps on giving.
01:45:32.200 - 01:46:18.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's all we have. Okay. Makes sense, for sure. Mark has more to add on the technical side or the implications, but look, we see a massive movement around, I would say social token integration, let's say, of social groups. Right. And it's something we are actively looking and deploying, actually. So the patreon for Ethereum is a very clear and direct use case.
01:46:18.130 - 01:47:03.330, Speaker A: It's good direction. It's a very good idea. Maybe, of course, it would be easier for the users to have it directly, maybe on Telegram or on Discord, on Twitter and stuff like that. There is a lot of integration going on in that direction. Make it super easy for the user to be able to donate to the platform, basically. Okay, thanks. I just wanted to add that we do have Telegram and Twitter Share buttons where you do have the opportunity to share your fan link via those channels.
01:47:03.330 - 01:47:39.440, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think there's a very good opportunity for this kind of app and use case to promote the fact that this is censorship resistant donation. So basically nobody can shut down the fact that you want to support an entity or a creator or whatever. And given the current trends, that may be a good selling point. That's awesome. Thanks. Yeah, I don't have anything to add to those.
01:47:39.440 - 01:48:10.390, Speaker A: It's a pretty straightforward concept, and I think I have a good understanding of what it is. Okay, thank you so much. All right, well, Mark, if you're going to sign off, thanks again for sticking around. Thank you very much for your presentation. Sorry for the one that didn't have the time to present with us, the Ave team. And let's see what you build next week. We can wait and keep pushing.
01:48:10.390 - 01:48:41.278, Speaker A: Thank you very much for your time, guys. To you, Mark. Thanks, Mark. All right, we're going to keep going again. Remember, we're going to plan to have two submission feedback sessions next Friday, but it looks like there might be some people we won't be able to get to or who missed this session. So potentially we'll have another session on Monday of next week sometime. But we're going to keep going here with dear Phi.
01:48:41.278 - 01:49:00.140, Speaker A: Go ahead. Hi, everyone. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Yeah, thanks. So oh, give me 1 second. Ha.
01:49:00.140 - 01:50:13.706, Speaker A: Did we lose you? Are you still here? What I'm guessing happened is he went to Share screen. Yeah. And then he had to update his zoom. He's rejoining. He so thanks for ham today. What I'm going to share is we build a permission list marketplace for Flashlong. Flashlong is very cool, but right now the Flashlong is only available for major stream tokens.
01:50:13.706 - 01:51:00.942, Speaker A: And we want to build a platform that's having this flashlong for all tokens. So the idea here is that basically anyone can create a flashloan pool for any asset they like. For example, here we build this uniswap like info page, shows all the top pools. And then there's already some pool created. So to create a pool, you have to go to our portal, which is Dfi.com, and we have deployed our smart contract on mainnet and all the testnet. And create a pool is very easy, just simply by click and then choose any assets you have and then put an amount.
01:51:00.942 - 01:51:34.762, Speaker A: And then you can supply the liquidity. And then if it's a new token, you will automatically create a new pool just like uniswap. And then once it's done, you come back, you will see the pool. So for example, this is the die pool. There is already like 277 die provided in the pool. Now developers can use the assets in this pool to execute the flash loan. How do I do that? Just come here.
01:51:34.762 - 01:52:21.674, Speaker A: And then right now, flash loan usually is executed from smart contract level, right? So usually we are not able to demo that. But here we prepare a contract that can demo you by having a dummy flash loan. To do so, you have to come to Ether scan. And then in Ether scan you can directly interact with our smart contract. And then here you can see the flashlong. So to execute and flash long, there's several parameters you have put. First is the flash long contract you deployed, which is the dummy flash long contract we have.
01:52:21.674 - 01:53:11.640, Speaker A: And then you have to specify how much die you want to ask you for the flash loan. For example, here, let's say you want to borrow 100 die. Yeah, that's 100 die. And then the data for this example, we don't have to put any data because our smart counter handled everything. And then once you execute it, you wait for the confirmation. But yeah, let's see. Once it's done, you will see like there's a flash long event shows up here.
01:53:11.640 - 01:53:51.080, Speaker A: And then each flash long we charge five pips as a fee. So everyone who joined the pool to provide the assets, we share all the flashlong income within this pool. So we build this because we see this upcharge opportunity and also like collateral swap demands for many kind of other assets. And right now, major flash loan provider cannot provide this. And then that's why we build this, which is a fully permissionless and decentralized flash loan protocol. Yeah, thanks. Cool.
01:53:51.080 - 01:54:14.862, Speaker A: First question is, are these just one? It's one sided pools. Like in uniswap you have the base assets, which is two sided liquidity. Is this just a single asset that you need to deposit? So as you can see here, it's a single asset. So one asset, one pool. And you can create unlimited pool. And then there's no, like, impermanent loss. Okay.
01:54:14.862 - 01:55:01.478, Speaker A: And can you just restate the limitations with other flash loan providers? Yes. So basically, we don't only limit to these pure assets, you can actually deposit a token C token or even, like, LP. So uniswap LP token here so that hacker can actually flash loan the LP and then unwrap the asset and then use it as well. So we basically reuse whatever assets available on the market. Okay, cool. That makes sense to me. Did you work the uniswap interface? Yes, we modified from uniswap for the time thing.
01:55:01.478 - 01:55:26.180, Speaker A: No, that makes sense. To reuse something that already exists, then you get a great UI for minimal work. Nicola, you want to go ahead? Yeah. Look, it's a very needed use case, in a sense. Right. It's a sort of like democratization of Flesh loans, which it goes down a little bit to the normal users right. And the ability to put them together.
01:55:26.180 - 01:56:17.080, Speaker A: It's going to drive adoption for sure. And it's a good tangible bridge between these two words, basically, where you can actually use it for easiest use cases, in a sense. So it's interesting, of course, the UAE is very intuitive. And it's even more intriguing the fact that you can unwrap other tokens and not use just you can use the LP, the C token, a token. So it's quite a little bit of to unpack, but for sure it has legs and does a pretty powerful idea. Thank you so much. Of course.
01:56:17.080 - 01:57:20.410, Speaker A: Why would somebody want to flash loan an LP token? So sometimes, say they don't have availability to borrow the token they want unless somehow someone deposit LP. Here first thing is that if you provide liquidity on, say, uniswap and then you get the LP, most likely you don't use it at all. You put it in the wallet. Right. So if you deposit the LP token in our platform, then someone can flash on that LP for what? For temporary unwrap the assets and execute the flashloan and then pay back by wrap the LP and then basically pay back the LP, which is okay, I see. But in our platform it's possible. I don't think that will be a major use case anyway because we just launched that on main net, too, because we have a contract audit.
01:57:20.410 - 01:57:44.738, Speaker A: And then right now, majority users still deposit, like, major asset token. They don't deposit LP or a token C token, as we imagine. Okay, cool. Yeah. No, that makes sense. I just didn't realize yeah. Will the front end be hooked up to that? I saw you jumped into the ether scan for the actual demo.
01:57:44.738 - 01:58:26.060, Speaker A: Are you going to actually have that hooked up by next week? Yeah, next week. Right now, if you come here, this interface Flesh loan actually is Add Liquidity, Remove Liquidity page. We plan to actually separate, make this tab as a pool, and then we add a new tab so that basically we. Implement this section on our interface so that even though someone going to rely on the UI, they can use it. But again, like Flash Loan, usually it's not a UI thing. It happens on a smart contract. Right.
01:58:26.060 - 01:58:48.594, Speaker A: Good stuff. Yeah. Thank you. One thing I appreciate is how the idea is very simple. Yeah. Thank you very much. I got to drop off, but I can for sure assure all the teams that I'll be on Discord.
01:58:48.594 - 01:59:11.980, Speaker A: I'll drop my handle and all the team is on Discord. And always happy to hear and provide feedback. Yeah, I think we're going to organize another session for Monday. If you're available, then we'll try to link you in. But yeah, we want to make sure people get time to present. Absolutely. Thank you for thank you.
01:59:11.980 - 01:59:16.934, Speaker A: Of course. My pleasure. Thank you, guys. Thank you all. Bye bye, guys. See you, Nicola. Bye bye.
01:59:16.934 - 01:59:35.074, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, Salty, NFT, are you guys still around it? Yes. Let me see if my video works. Can you hear me? Yes. Cool. Can you see me? I can. All right.
01:59:35.074 - 02:00:08.266, Speaker A: Sorry about the hair. Anyway, let me see if I can share my screen. There we go. Can you see this question? Are you on, like, an iPad or something? No, I'm on the browser. Isn't Mike okay? Just because there's been a few presentations and then yours included, where it comes in as a portrait mode. So I'm just curious how that's happening. Or if you have, like, a vertically oriented screen, is it still portrait? No, now it's landscape.
02:00:08.266 - 02:00:20.978, Speaker A: This is better. Okay. Yeah. This is just the figma presentation for a second. It's kind of zoomed out, but that's the entire screen anyway, so everything's okay. All right, cool. So essentially this is our project.
02:00:20.978 - 02:00:51.254, Speaker A: We haven't really decided 100% on the name. We have Salty Lend or NF Lend Loan ft. Anyway, so the point is, the problem currently that we're trying to solve is that there's a lot of NFTs out there that are just sitting around doing nothing. Right. And also there's a lot of liquidity sitting around doing nothing. So what's the solution? The solution is we need to allow NFTs to be used as collateral. And it just so happens that Ave has credit delegation, which is a fantastic way to give more interest to depositors.
02:00:51.254 - 02:01:12.366, Speaker A: And we decided that we can use NFTs and create a marketplace for getting loans. Anyway, so this is our UI. Essentially, there's two sides, obviously. There's the borrower and the lender. Borrowers can create a borrower request and stuff. But let's first go ahead and move through the UI. Then I have the contract architecture here anyway, so this is a tentative UI.
02:01:12.366 - 02:01:57.780, Speaker A: It's going to change a little bit. It's not final, but it is essentially the gist of it. You'll be able to see all the loans you have, all the assets that you have deposited, your collaterals, as well as what you're owed right, the borrow request you've accepted. So here you've got your this is essentially what you've borrowed, right? This is essentially the assets you've deposited, et cetera. We'll be showing a gallery of different NFTs that you have that you can set up a bar request for. So here, for instance, let's say you have this wonderful, adorable little crypto kitty. You're able to create a bar request that will be able to use any a token that's available.
02:01:57.780 - 02:02:49.586, Speaker A: You'll be able to set a specific loan duration, specific interest rate. This is a coupon that's fixed, et cetera, right? So, yeah, we wanted to get a little bit of feedback on how the card looks. That's essentially the idea here, right? And on the other side, you'll also be able to browse borrow requests that have been created. You'll be able to check the NFT, check the NFT, ID, the address, et cetera, right? And also view it on OpenSea, which is cool. And yeah, you'll be able to make your calculations on the lender side. Obviously there's more risk because you're borrowing from Aave with an NFT as collateral, right? So if the NFT goes under your loan, obviously then there's no incentive for the borrower to repay anyway. So that's essentially the gist of it up till now.
02:02:49.586 - 02:03:22.538, Speaker A: I know we're short on time, but yeah, so there's a little bit more technicalities in there. There's also a fee model that can be enabled that allows for a percentage of the coupon to be going to a certain address, maybe a dow one day, who knows. Anyway, so that's the UI and that's the user experience largely right behind the scenes is a little bit more this is essentially a little graph that I made. Here a little diagram I made. I actually made this before I created the contracts, which are now done, more or less. But this essentially explains it's not pretty, but it gets a job done. It essentially explains the architecture of the back end contracts of the entire platform.
02:03:22.538 - 02:04:20.890, Speaker A: So from the borrower perspective, there isn't much that you have to do, right? You just have to create your borrower request. It's a pretty low friction thing. Even the gas cost isn't that much. Of course, you do need to approve your NFT and then your NFT gets locked with the borrower. Okay? And as for lenders, as we've shown, you can browse different borrow requests, see their data, see which one you'd like to delegate your credit to, and then interact with the Avid debt token which will be available on our website, obviously to do delegate the credit to the contract, get the borrower request fulfilled and that's it. And then obviously after a while the borrower will be forced to pay interest because there is a liquidation threshold and the debt accumulates like a debt token on Ave, it accumulates in real time, which is kind of cool. So essentially they have to repay before the liquidation threshold gets passed or before the loan term expires.
02:04:20.890 - 02:04:41.766, Speaker A: So this is essentially the structure. You lock your NFT in the borrow request, which is on the contract. Right. And yeah, lenders can liquidate any borrower request that the lender in. That's essentially it. That's the gist of it. We're still working on a little bit of stuff, but yeah, hopefully I explained that.
02:04:41.766 - 02:05:09.518, Speaker A: Okay, sure. One question is, sure, maybe I missed this, but what's the price Oracle for? There are no price oracles. How do you value the NFTs? Yeah, so this is actually something that we were considering, right. Because it's actually impossible technically or it's actually highly manipulable. Right. So what did we decide to do? Nothing. We don't need to value them.
02:05:09.518 - 02:05:46.010, Speaker A: Right. We'll leave that to the lender. And we actually believe that there's going to be a market that's going to be I actually highly believe that there's going to be developments that are going to be showing that collateralized NFTs will likely be valued at a low collateralization ratio to prevent the risk for lenders. Obviously it's external. We don't need to manage the price necessarily that's on the lender. Right. In exchange for the additional interest that you're earning for your delegation, you take on the risk of having that NFT and being stuck with it if eventually there's no more incentive for the borrower to repay the loan.
02:05:46.010 - 02:06:24.470, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I guess that makes sense. Just really quick for anybody who's still sticking around. I think I just confirmed another session in 1 hour from now. So if you want to jump back in 1 hour, I see we have seven more teams after this, so if you want to drop off now and then come back, I will put the zoom link in the discord and that will be with Austin Griffith. If you know him, he's done the scaffold eat stuff. So if anybody is still on this call and would like feedback from Austin, that will be in 1 hour or 50 minutes at 01:00 p.m.. Eastern.
02:06:24.470 - 02:07:12.406, Speaker A: Victor, you don't have to stick around, you're not obligated to stay. So like I said, in 1 hour there will be a session with Austin and I'll put the link in the discord. If you want to stay on this one, that's totally fine. I know some people are in different time zones, but we'll jump back to Peter. So you said that you're not worried about valuations, which is I'll have to think about that a bit more. I mean, logically, like this is for collectors, right. You got to be able to value an NFT, right.
02:07:12.406 - 02:07:59.234, Speaker A: You shouldn't be able to take a loan on an NFT or to fulfill a borrow request to be a lender against an NFT without bearing the risk of that NFT to begin with. And I don't know, creating a price Oracle for NFTs is way beyond the scope of this. There's no way we can it's not that I know of because they tend to be highly illiquid markets to begin with for specific NFTs, but there's nothing stopping a lender from going to see the price history on OpenSea or anything like that. Right, yeah. I wonder if at a minimum you could just pull in the ETH amount and use that as a proxy. Obviously there are fluctuations in the ETH price or whatever was paid for it. Yeah, we could.
02:07:59.234 - 02:08:56.966, Speaker A: We are planning to integrate OpenSea prices and stuff like that. The only problem is if you own that NFT, then you could potentially bid on it with another address just to spoof the price or something like, you know, even worse, you could do that with multiple addresses to make it seem like the NFT has been traded often. Right. So we have to think about that. But I think that as of now, getting something off the ground like this might be a good start, but it's definitely a big deal. If we could create a price oracle for NFTs one day, there's probably some crypto economic mechanism similar to like a prediction market where you can have people stake on the value and then wherever the value converges, that's like sort of the rough range, but that's probably out of scope for this hackathon. Can you jump back to your UI really quick? I just want to see it.
02:08:56.966 - 02:09:19.070, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, it looked pretty good. Is there a specific page you want me to move to? No, no, I just wanted to just look through it again. I appreciate that you have like it's easy to see the hierarchy of information. So this is good. Yeah, that's TIO Teo is like a beast. No, it's good stuff.
02:09:19.070 - 02:09:38.222, Speaker A: I don't have any other feedback. Cool. Thank you for your time. Looking good. Cool. Okay, so I just put it in the chat, but I just confirmed that Austin is going to be available for a session in 1 hour. So if you want to let's see, we have seven teams.
02:09:38.222 - 02:10:13.548, Speaker A: Are all of these teams sticking around right now or do you want to get feedback with me and Austin in a bit? If you want to just unmute and let me know, that would be helpful. Who is still on the call? Wario and Morgan. You're going to come back at 01:00 p.m.. Eastern. Okay, so that's two teams. Who else is still here? Who needs to present on this session? I'm still here. Hello.
02:10:13.548 - 02:10:50.696, Speaker A: Okay, you want to present during this one? Yeah. Okay. If it's possible. Yeah, but I just didn't understand. You said that there will be something on Discord or some possibility to show on Discord also that would be like if you wanted to connect with the Ave team specifically because I know they're much more technically minded, they have more expertise than I do. So if you wanted to connect with Ave, you could just reach out in their sponsor channel and they will give you feedback directly. Okay, I will try it if you need feedback from them.
02:10:50.696 - 02:11:14.690, Speaker A: Okay, so it looks like somebody is somebody is showing already. Somebody is sharing their screen. Who is this? Not me. John. I think there will be a new zoom link that I will put into the discord. Austin's going to provide it, I'll put it into the market make channel. Who is yeah, that was me.
02:11:14.690 - 02:11:47.176, Speaker A: Avish, are you next? Is Cred swap? Yeah. You want to present in this session and not the next? Yeah, I want to present in this session. Okay, yeah, go ahead. Okay, I'll share the screen. So our UI is not fully complete but we have built a smart contract and I will explain you this flow. So can you see my yeah, yeah. So we are building credit default swaps.
02:11:47.176 - 02:12:46.552, Speaker A: So we have two entities. One is the, let's say, corporate agency that takes loans from the abe and there is another called insurance who would be a risk taker who would basically hold the tap tokens. So the insurance would basically allow the corporate agency to take flash loans and with that flash loan, with flash loan Capital sugar Flash Loan Capital, this corporate agency can do anything, do an arbitrage and earn profit from it. But 30% of that profit would be transferred to the insurance. The insurance is taking the risk. Right. And then based on the performance of the corporate agency, ERC, debt tokens cannot be transferable.
02:12:46.552 - 02:14:07.000, Speaker A: So according to the performance of the corporate agency we are creating NFT debt derivative token which can be traded on the secondary marketplace. So whoever buys that derivative becomes the insurance. Now the amount 30% would be transferred to that particular person and we have built a basically API that contains all the profits. So we are fetching the profits from there and basically fetching the profits from there to the corporate agency and creating a crone job that periodically hits this contract and checks if the corporate agency has a profit or not and if his performance is good. And based on that, NFT is created. Okay, do you have any sort of UI or is it just it's just a smart contract, smart contact and the user flow? Okay, yeah, I'll admit I don't have a really deep financial background so some of this stuff is probably over my head but I think it seems to make sense what you're proposing. But beyond that I don't have a ton of feedback.
02:14:07.000 - 02:15:10.988, Speaker A: I appreciate the use of the frogs if you're integrating link so I know you'll get some points there for the mean value. What other go ahead. It's basically credit default swaps, right? Yeah. What other sponsors based on the performance of the depth of that corporate agency NFTs will be created which are double A rated or if the performance is bad, then triple C rated NFTs will be created. Yeah, gotcha. And how do people actually bid on the NFTs? Or is it only linked to the original? No, no one's going to bid on it, but people can buy it. So the AA rated NFT would be highly priced because it ensures that the corporate agency is performing well.
02:15:10.988 - 02:15:45.800, Speaker A: So if anyone wants to become the insurance who wants to buy that NFT, he would have to pay the higher price. Higher price. Okay. Gotcha. Would you try to integrate this with existing protocols or are you trying yeah, so we are using it as project. We are using Aave credit delegation and chain link. Okay, so then the output is the NFT which represents the yeah, yeah.
02:15:45.800 - 02:16:19.324, Speaker A: Which represents the depth derivative. Okay. Yeah, I think I have a handle on it. I'll have to read a little bit more about what you're proposing, but it seems to make sense. Do you think you'll be able to have a UI for next week? Yeah, I think basically UI will be three pages. One page for registering the corporate industry, another for registering the insurance, another for creating a secondary marketplace where the NFTs can be traded. Okay, gotcha.
02:16:19.324 - 02:16:47.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll look forward to seeing that. Thank you. Thanks for presenting. I think David and Marks will have more feedback on this. Definitely reach out DAP tokens and credit delegation works. Yeah, they would be perfect for giving you more specific technical or financial feedback on this kind of stuff. So again, reach out to them in the Ave sponsor.
02:16:47.420 - 02:17:16.706, Speaker A: Okay? Okay. Thank you. Sure thing. All right, so next up was Morgan. Unless you're coming back for the session in a little bit, I do not hear or see a Morgan. So we're going to move on to DigiLab. Hello.
02:17:16.706 - 02:18:33.120, Speaker A: Yep. Whenever you're ready. Go ahead. Okay, so I want to present our last week work and our project with do you see my screen? I do, yes. So, as I told you the result, we want to build a liquidity pool containing assets from different chains. And we took as an example for Ethereum chain and binance smart chain. So we have wrote smart contracts, we deployed them on testnet, but we implemented the base operation to test the interchange negotiation through chain link.
02:18:33.120 - 02:19:08.010, Speaker A: We implemented to test it. To make proof of concept. We implemented just for example, swap token. So we have ERC 20 like token on the Ethereum chain and we have ERC 20 light token on the finance marching. So we built also a little user interface. So now I am connected. Please pay attention.
02:19:08.010 - 02:20:12.132, Speaker A: We have two wallets on our application MetaMask and binance wallet. So this is shown, the balance on the Ethereum is shown on the top and this is the balance of the token on the binance marching. So I want to show you the operation of swapping assets from the Ethereum for the assets from binance March chain. So, first operation is approved cases. Okay. Now we have to wait for transaction to mine. Okay.
02:20:12.132 - 02:20:46.892, Speaker A: Now it is mined. Now we can swap one token from Ethereum and we have balance. You see we have 36 and the balance on binance machine is 57. Source work. The first operation was approved. I didn't say that the first operation was approved. So now we are waiting for other transaction.
02:20:46.892 - 02:21:39.840, Speaker A: Actually everything is done but we wait for transaction to be successful. I pay your attention that this transaction goes through chainlink. We wrote special adapter to call. Now we see that transaction was successful and now we can check balance. Now it's 35 and 57. So we had a successful, successful, successful exchange of tokens. Actually we have deployed all the infrastructure as I told you, the smart contracts and the adapter.
02:21:39.840 - 02:22:11.624, Speaker A: And we also deployed our own chain link node where our adapter is living. Okay, so that's our work for this week. So we have the proof of concept interchange negotiation with chain link nodes. That's it. Hello? Cool. Yeah. Sorry.
02:22:11.624 - 02:22:53.320, Speaker A: I was muted. So this is good in that it's like a very clear concept and very clear use case. People want to go between chains without necessarily relying on having to go to a centralized exchange. So this is good to see. Can you tell me a little bit more about what chainlink adapters actually do? What's the trust assumption there? I can't tell. Okay, go ahead. Okay, so the trust assumption is I can show you the code.
02:22:53.320 - 02:23:21.150, Speaker A: Maybe. So the API that chainlink built, it allows you to call smart contract. Actually, we have our own smart contract and we have special smart contract that interfaces chainlink node, the adapter living machine node. And you are calling the method from.
