00:00:01.680 - 00:01:05.762, Speaker A: Thank you all for the opportunity to be here today. Real pleasure to talk to this group from whom I always learn so much. I was asked actually today to make a sort of combined talk where I introduced the there are three related talks we'll be hearing today, and if Kevin Leighton Brown is here, you might hear a fourth related talk at some point too. But let me just get started on what we have here. So the three related talks today are one by me, where I'm going to give an introduction to the whole set of things and then talk about the substitution metric, the talk by Ilya Segal on privacy substitutes and optimization, and the talk by Sheng Wu Li on obviously strategy proof mechanism. There's also related work by Kevin Leighton Brown. These are all motivated in part by, in part by many things, but in part by work that's being done on the so called us incentive auction, which I'll tell you about now.
00:01:05.762 - 00:01:55.964, Speaker A: So the things that set a background for all of this are this huge auction which is about to take place that people estimate, you know, you read in the newspapers, anywhere from $40 to $80 billion worth of transactions. So it's going to be a really enormous deal. And it's just for background. So you know what we're talking about. This was something that was conceived in 2010 where the National Broadband plan in the US said that Congress should consider expressly expanding the FCC's authority to enable it to conduct incentive auctions. That's where the term comes from in which incumbent licensees may relinquish spectrum rights to other parties or to the FCC. So that was proposed and there's been a whole series of the Spectrum act in 2012 enabled this.
00:01:55.964 - 00:02:43.664, Speaker A: There was a notice of proposed rule in 2011 after the National Broadband Plan, but before the spectrum auction, I was hired by the FCC to put together a team to begin planning for this legislation came in 2012. A notice of proposed rulemaking which proposed the design that the auctionomics team put together was proposed in 2012. It was adopted. There was a report in order in 2014 which provided rules for the implementation of the auction. And most recently on August 6, the procedures, public notice was issued which established the procedures for the auction. So this is going to happen. First bid will be on March 29, 2016.
00:02:43.664 - 00:03:32.980, Speaker A: And the consultants contract. I like to put this up because it's really daunting. I was asked to sign a contract in September 20 eleven to put together a team with these design goals listed for the auction. They wanted efficiency, they wanted the net revenues to be adequate, whatever that means. The design should minimize gaming and strategic behavior, avoid windfalls to bidders, be feasible to implement in an acceptable timeframe. Participation is voluntary, a group payments constraint. They were paying attention to the core and thinking about core selecting auctions, then it should be simple to understand and participate and transparent, which I understood to mean easy to audit after the fact, essentially.
00:03:32.980 - 00:04:07.794, Speaker A: And those were the design goals. $40 to $80 billion auction. So this was quite a project. What I want to talk to you about is what the novel challenges were in this design. So, because the set of talks that we're going to see involve research, involve innovation in basically four major areas that we'll be talking about. The first is that the first area is that market clearing. This is different than the standard theory of markets and the standard theory of markets.
00:04:07.794 - 00:04:44.850, Speaker A: In economics, you have supply, you have demand, you have people buying and selling the same thing, and you have wheat, you have people selling wheat, you have people buying wheat. You find a market clearing price where supply crosses demand. Here, despite the public think that these guys are just buying and selling radio spectrum, they're not buying and selling the same thing. The television broadcast rights look very different than mobile broadband rights. They both use the same resource, they both use the radio spectrum, but they have very different interference properties. They have to be paired in different ways. The rights are actually completely different.
00:04:44.850 - 00:05:55.040, Speaker A: And what has to happen is we have to buy broadcast rights and sell broadband rights and convert them in between. And we have to buy roughly the same broadcast rights in every part of the United States in order to create a ban plan that works with mobile phones. So it's not one good that we're buying, but a collection of complimentary goods, and we have to convert them into licenses for broadband in a highly non linear way. So it turns out the tv broadcast licenses are these little 6 MHz chunks of spectrum, and mobile broadband licenses are 10 MHz chunks of spectrum, 5 uplink and 5 downlink. And depending which frequencies you buy, you can create different licenses in different ways. So we have this problem of figuring out what market clearing should be, and that's novel in auction design, and we conceive of it as a production problem in which we're buying inputs and selling outputs. The second problem is that the production problem is computationally hard.
00:05:55.040 - 00:06:27.458, Speaker A: I saw Kevin's over there. I saw Kevin come in. The finding tv channels for stations that choose to remain on the air, not sell their rights, is like a graph coloring problem, but with extra constraints. You have to assign a tv channel. Well, I'll tell you more about this in detail in a few moments. You have to assign a tv channel to each station that remains on the air so that no two channel adjacent channels, channels that are too close, are assigned. No two adjacent stations are assigned to the same channel.
00:06:27.458 - 00:06:59.674, Speaker A: No two adjacent nodes are the same color. It's like a graph coloring problem, but with extra constraints of various kinds. Domain constraints or certain channels you can't use near the canadian border, and certain channels you can't use near the mexican border. And there are some adjacent channel. I described to you the main constraints, the so called co channel constraints or other constraints, too. So it's similar to a graph coloring problem. It's an np complete problem or class of problems, but it's not a graph coloring problem.
00:06:59.674 - 00:07:49.334, Speaker A: Formulating feasibility is a SaT problem, as Kevin did, I understand, involves about 600,000 constraints. So it's a large scale problem, and we'll have to solve a lot of these during the course of auction in real time. So this is if Kevin gets a chance to talk. I don't know when you're talking out here, but the talking about the computational innovations that were done to make this something that we can do is one of the elements. Another element is to encourage participation. Bidding to sell needs to be easy. A lot of the participants in the auction, the people that we thought were most likely to sell when we were doing the design were small broadcasters who own, you know, they own channel 34 in Detroit or, you know, channel 27 in Atlanta.
00:07:49.334 - 00:08:23.204, Speaker A: And they're small businesses that, you know, it's their life business. Maybe they have a couple of channels in a couple of different cities, but they're small broadcasters, not huge. They're not at and T and Verizon. They have to participate in an auction. It's got to be easy for them or they won't participate. They have a real option of not participating and saying, gee, we'll let the big guys participate and we'll sell to somebody after the auction if we're going to sell it all. And if they don't participate, we won't be able to clear very much spectrum, and we won't be able to achieve the objectives of the national Broadband plan.
00:08:23.204 - 00:09:10.244, Speaker A: So Sheng Boolean is going to talk later today about what it means for, for an auction to be obviously strategy proof. It's going to turn out that if you try to explain this auction, the auction we're doing to bidders, which involves these thousands of np complete calculations and say, trust me, it's strategy proof, just report truthfully, that doesn't fly. We don't think that everybody's going to say, gee, we trust the government that much, that we'll just report truthfully. It has to be not just strategy proof, but obviously strategy proof. And Sheng Wu will tell you more about that later. Then the auction algorithm itself needs to perform well. It turns out that this problem is too big to do optimization in any way.
00:09:10.244 - 00:09:55.144, Speaker A: If you did optimization, what would you tell the bidders? How would the bidders bid? So the auction algorithm, which doesn't involve optimization, has to perform well in some sense. And Ilya will talk about some elements of what that means in his talk later. And I'll talk about some elements of what it means in my talk now. Okay, so I want to talk now about the, for just a moment about the production problem being computationally hard. So this is a graph of the interference around one station. So you see here a station in the center of the graph. Each node in this graph is a UHFtV station.
00:09:55.144 - 00:10:34.200, Speaker A: Each arc in the graph is a pair of stations that cannot be assigned to the same channel. If you think about this as a graph coloring problem, these are the main kinds of constraints that we have. And you see quite a bit of complexity, though, other nodes in the graph, the white nodes that you see here are things that are within two steps from the central node. It's a pretty complex mess. And this is a spring loaded graph showing the overall Us interference structure. You can see a little bit in this graph, the spring loading. I think you guys all know what spring loading algorithms are.
00:10:34.200 - 00:11:06.244, Speaker A: You try to pull together things that are connected, you try to push apart things that are not connected and reveal something of the structure of the graph. And you can see a little bit, you can see that around cities. This is going on in here too, but you can see it out here around cities. Everything interferes with everything else. You know, we have some number of channels in New York City, and if you have 20 channels, 20 stations in New York City, no two of those can be on the same channel. Everyone interferes those are clicks in the graph. Everyone interferes with every other.
00:11:06.244 - 00:11:42.444, Speaker A: But there's just this huge mass of things that are connected in a complex way that make this, say, a hard problem to solve. In principle, the auction will probably need to solve more than 100,000. We don't really know yet, but it's going to need to solve a lot of these problems, and it's going to need to solve them in real time. Okay, the third thing I want to talk about is market clearing being. So this is all the introductory part, this long introduction. But the overall scope of what the project is. It's a big project that's been going on for several years.
00:11:42.444 - 00:12:25.728, Speaker A: The market clearing involves a production problem. So how are we going to do market clearing? Okay, now, conceptually, I'm going to do this at two levels for you. I'm going to start off first with the idea that somehow or another spectrum is uniform, which it's not. But just to give you conceptually, what the concept, what the idea is. So what we're going to do is, based on the applications to participate in the auction, we're going to say, what's the largest number of channels we could hope to clear? Suppose we decide, you know, we can clear 126 spectrum, that's 21 channels. Each channel is 6 MHz. So we set a quantity target, and somewhere out of sight there is.
00:12:25.728 - 00:13:18.074, Speaker A: We think of there as being like a supply curve, which is this upward sloping curve here, and a demand curve, which is the downward sloping curve. That is, if you offer, this is the usual economist thing, quantities on the x axis, prices on the y axis. If you offer a higher price, you're going to get a larger quantity supplied, but a smaller quantity demanded. So that's what the graph shows. And what we'll do is we'll announce that, and we'll start an auction in which prices fall in the reverse auction gradually and rise in the forward auction. So they fall and rise. And what we discover here is, gee, we can't clear that much because the price we're getting from the buyers in the forward auction is less than the price we're paying to the sellers in the reverse auction.
00:13:18.074 - 00:13:52.014, Speaker A: We're suffering a loss. So what the algorithm is, we'll say, gee, that was too ambitious. We will reduce the quantity and let the price in the reverse auction continue to fall and in the forward auction continue to rise, but we still have a loss. And then we'll reduce the target further, and we'll let the price continue to fall in the reverse auction and continue to rise in the forward auction. We have a revenue target we have to meet. We have to pay. The broadcasters who stay on the air have to retune, they'll have retuning costs roughly $2 billion.
00:13:52.014 - 00:14:26.730, Speaker A: We have to raise $2 billion in profit, at least to cover the relocation costs of the bidders who don't sell their spectrum. So we have a net revenue target. And there's some other restrictions here, too, which I'll. But that's roughly the concept. This is what economists call marshallian dynamics, where it's adjusting quantity and letting the forward the buy price and the sell price adapt to a quantity to find market clearing. The actual process looks like this. It's very similar.
00:14:26.730 - 00:14:58.648, Speaker A: This is the graph from the FCC's notice. There's a reverse auction in which prices fall, a forward auction in which prices rise, but there are different prices for different stations in different parts of the country. It's not all one product. Still, we're trying to clear some number of channels in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, everywhere. We have these auctions going on, which I'll describe in some more detail. There's a cost associated with those. We have forward auction, which we're selling licenses in different parts of the country.
00:14:58.648 - 00:15:15.500, Speaker A: There's revenue associated with those. And the concept is exactly what I showed you a moment ago. Okay. Okay. The targets are local or global? The target's global. There's one. So we're trying to clear.
00:15:15.500 - 00:15:17.900, Speaker A: So you're getting money from Chicago to.
00:15:17.932 - 00:15:19.444, Speaker B: Cover everything else in the country.
00:15:19.564 - 00:15:49.038, Speaker A: Oh, in principle, it's the totals that matter. These devices are set up so that they have to know something about what frequencies they're going to be using. So we have to say, you know, these channels are being cleared for uplink, out of your phone. These channels are going to be used for downlink, out of your phone. And they have to be the same pretty much. There's some filtering things you can do, but they have to be pretty much the same across the whole country. For simplification, let's just say they have to be exactly the same across the whole country.
00:15:49.038 - 00:16:01.354, Speaker A: And so we're getting different prices and we add them up. We have perfect complements, if you will, on the supply side and perfect complements on the demand side. And it's the total prices that are being compared.
00:16:02.694 - 00:16:07.550, Speaker B: The reason I'm asking is that you said that prices are going to move differently in different parts of the country.
00:16:07.622 - 00:16:08.118, Speaker A: Yes.
00:16:08.246 - 00:16:09.874, Speaker B: What determines this?
00:16:10.264 - 00:16:27.848, Speaker A: I will show you. We're going there. Okay. So we'll get there. So I'm trying to give you right now an overview of what the challenges were in the design and what the research challenges were, what kinds of solutions we're coming up with. And then I'll talk a little bit more about the research. Yeah.
00:16:28.016 - 00:16:36.564, Speaker C: Perfect complement was the demand on the supply side, and I see the demand side complement. I don't see the supply side well.
00:16:36.604 - 00:16:57.316, Speaker A: So in order to clear channel 27, let's suppose I want to clear channels 31 to 51, for example. Then I have to have that much free spectrum in every city in Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit. That's the supply side. Okay, so I have to buy channels. It's not.
00:16:57.340 - 00:16:59.060, Speaker C: The sellers have compliments.
00:16:59.252 - 00:17:08.134, Speaker A: No, no, it's not. It's us, the FCC, in its production problem. The FCC's problem. These are perfect complements, right.
00:17:10.074 - 00:17:18.090, Speaker B: And is it clear which way you move? Like, I mean, say you have the core spectrum from 40 to 50 MHz. Would you know in which direction to move, to expand or is that also.
00:17:18.202 - 00:17:43.638, Speaker A: No. So we've, so we've decided that in advance. We're going to, we're going to clear down from channel 51. Channel 51 is the highest channel that's currently used for broadcast television. We're going to clear some set of channels down from 51. Part of what makes this nonlinear, by the way. So as you clear down, there are guard bands that you have to put in between the uplink and the downlink.
00:17:43.638 - 00:18:19.854, Speaker A: And then channel 37 is set aside for medical devices and radio astronomy. And if you clear down below channel 37, then you need to. The production involves putting a guard band above and below channel 37. It's really very nonlinear. The conversion from channels cleared to broadband spectrum created, suppose in one city in the United States, no one wants to participate, then everything goes their way. Or there's a way to force them. No, but one city, no one wants to sell anything because they don't trust.
00:18:19.854 - 00:18:54.436, Speaker A: Okay, so in the simplified version I'm giving you, if that happens, we wouldn't be able to sell. In fact, another one of the challenges was how to deal with that, and I'm not going to talk about that today. But that's a separate challenge. The way we're getting, the way we hope to get people to participate is the part of this design is the opening prices are very high. When we announced the tentative opening prices, all these people said, oh, there's no way we'll sell our television station. This is our business. We're Fox.
00:18:54.436 - 00:19:14.876, Speaker A: We're a Fox affiliate. We're an NBC affiliate. We're never going to sell these stations. And then we posted tentative opening prices. $900 million in Los Angeles was the kind of opening price. People are like $900 million. And imagine you have a station in Los Angeles and this is over the air television.
00:19:14.876 - 00:19:52.486, Speaker A: So you need to know that in the United States, 90% of people get their broadcast signal either through cable or satellite. So even if you got shut off, you'd still have 90% of your customers left. We're talking about 10% of your customers, $900 million. This is completely outrageous. Everybody is interested. Fox is interested, CB's is interested. Everybody's interested at the opening prices, so we do expect that we'll have enough interest at the opening prices, but it may turn out that those prices are too high for at and T Verizon, T Mobile, and so on, in which case the process will continue.
00:19:52.486 - 00:20:35.232, Speaker A: But we do expect to be able to clear almost uniformly, there are some areas that are problematic, but almost uniformly okay. To encourage participation, bidding to sell needs to be easy. So that's what Shengwu is going to talk about, but I'm going to tell you just a little bit more about that. So one of the things that was talked about at the very beginning was the possibility of Vickrey auctions. You guys all know what Vickre auctions are, but the problem with Vickrey auctions, or a problem with Vickrey auctions, is you can't even estimate these prices accurately. So each Vickrey price is the difference between two numbers. It's between the total value of the continuing broadcasters, with or without one station.
00:20:35.232 - 00:21:21.244, Speaker A: It's the incremental contribution of a station to total value. With 2000 stations, a 1% computation error in the optimization leads to, on average, a 2000% pricing error in estimating the victory price. And including, as we found in the data with the FCC, had lots of calculations, and we found a whole bunch of negative prices where we'll take your station if you pay us for it, because we get big pricing errors. And testing with CPlex and Gurobi, the best guarantees that emerged. They ran these things for weeks attempting to do optimizations. They had a team of operations researchers formulating the questions. They got performance.
00:21:21.244 - 00:21:55.022, Speaker A: They could guarantee 97% of the optimum after weeks of computation. This just isn't good enough to calculate Vickrey prices, even if they could be calculated accurately. Vickrey prices are going to be awfully hard to explain to bidders and for bidders to verify. I'm going to buy your station, and I've decided your price is $10 million. And you say, where did you come up with that number? Well, I did this calculation. I ran Gurobi for weeks. I'm the government, trust me, it's just.
00:21:55.022 - 00:22:41.792, Speaker A: And then explaining the calculation, it's really tough. So we decided we needed something different than that. Again, Shengwu has a deeper treatment of this that you'll hear a little later. So we settled on an alternative greedy based procedures, which some of you have already heard about, these deferred acceptance auctions, and one of the big surprises. And this is what I want to talk about when I get to the technical part later today is how well this performed in the nineties of percent of the value that the optimization obtained. We got really high percentages from just a greedy procedure. And that was a big surprise.
00:22:41.792 - 00:23:32.750, Speaker A: And so it was a big surprise because so again, I've learned a bunch of stuff from computer scientists. I see all these worst case bounds. Worst case bounds, if you don't have substitutes, if you don't have the right structure and your constraints, if your constraints don't form a matriidal, the worst case bounds are terrible. And here we're getting these things in the nineties of percents. And why is that happening? Hey, Kevin, here's my call out to you. Thank you for letting me use your slides on this to explain the algorithm for the reverse auction. Kevin has a beautiful analogy, which is airline overbooking.
00:23:32.750 - 00:24:04.460, Speaker A: So the idea is that we've already sold seats, so to speak. That is, we have stations that are on the air. We've given them the right to be on the air. We need to get them to give up their seats to move off the air. And so Kevin turned this into an airline over booking example we have. And I will say we'll come a little bit more to this. If you're just thinking about algorithms and you want to talk, you have a knapsack problem or something like that.
00:24:04.460 - 00:24:54.800, Speaker A: You can think of the problem of putting things in the knapsack or leaving things out of the knapsack. You're basically just sorting things into two groups subject to some constraints. You don't tend to think algorithmically of there being a big difference between putting things in and taking things out. But in economics, there is a big difference between those two things, because it's the bids that we accept, the category that we call the accepted bids, those are the people that get paid, and the bids that we reject, those are the people that don't get paid. And so the incentives are different for algorithms, where we decide who to reject in a greedy fashion and who to accept in a greedy fashion. So even though algorithmically you may not see much distinction in terms of incentives, there is a distinction, and so you may want to pay a little bit of attention to that as we move along. So here's the airline overbooking problem.
00:24:54.800 - 00:25:31.868, Speaker A: We start off, this is, if you like, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, we have, or it's first class, business class, economy class. We have people who already have seats, and there's plenty of seats for everybody. But somebody decides we need a smaller plane, we're going to use the big plane for something else. And so all of a sudden, we have a bunch of people that don't have seats, okay? And the airline has to find seats for these people. And so it doesn't have room for everybody. So it offers compensation. It says $1,000.
00:25:31.868 - 00:25:54.394, Speaker A: I'll give $1,000. This is an auction. I'm tentatively offering $1,000 for people who will give up their seat on the plane. And a whole bunch of people say, great, I'll take $1,000 to give up my seat on the plane, and all these people move off. Well, now we have more people off than we need. There's empty seats with $1,000. There's empty seats in first class, business class, economy class.
00:25:54.394 - 00:26:16.306, Speaker A: So we say, oops, we don't need quite so many people. We're lowering our offer to dollar 800. This is our descending auction. And a bunch of people say, oops, well, sorry, I'm going back. So we now have a bunch of people back on the plane. And notice now that first class is full, so we can't afford to have any of these people go back. We need them.
00:26:16.306 - 00:26:42.574, Speaker A: So we don't lower the offer to them. We fix their price at $800 and say, okay, you guys, we're taking you. Your price is dollar 800, but these other prices are going down. So we offer dollar 600, and a bunch of people move back. We still have space. We offer $500 more people move back. Now business class is full, say, gee, now these two guys, we can't afford for them to change their minds.
00:26:42.574 - 00:27:04.422, Speaker A: We're going to freeze their price at $500. They've agreed to take $500, but we lowered the price to $400 for economy and then to $300. There's still empty space to 250. Now economy class is full as well. We freeze the price at $2.50 and we have different prices. So this is a partial answer to your question.
00:27:04.422 - 00:27:42.560, Speaker A: This is only part of the answer. But we have different prices in different parts of the country based on who is willing to sell. And based on our feasibility constraints here, the feasibility constraints do form a matride. They're really simple. And consequently, this actually, and by the way, if this is New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, you see how we determine prices for stations in each of the different areas? Okay. Yeah. Do you also take your prices up during the process? No, it can only go down, and they're going down by smaller increments than I showed you.
00:27:42.560 - 00:28:15.062, Speaker A: So there is no chance that there will be too much demand. Right. There's no chance that there'll be too much demand. We actually process the station sequentially one at a time. And so what actually goes on in the auction is over here. We lower the prices from 300 to 200 to 251 station at a time during the processing and the auction. And if you are frozen, that is, if we don't have space for you while your price is still 300, then we pay you 300.
00:28:15.062 - 00:28:45.536, Speaker A: So we don't necessarily get exactly equal prices for everybody in economy class in our, our processing, it's actually sequential. That way we never overshoot. Now notice that suppose these calculations were complicated. I have to figure out whether I have space for you. I have to solve a graph coloring problem to figure out. Is there any way to assign you a channel? So it's a complicated calculation. Nevertheless, you can figure out that this is strategy proof for you.
00:28:45.536 - 00:29:25.538, Speaker A: I've just offered you $1,000 for a seat that's worth, worth 350 to you. Say, you know, well, maybe he'll lower the price, maybe he won't, but I'm not going to say no to $1,000. So it's strategy proof for you, even though you don't understand the algorithm. So that's one of the things we wanted to do. It's obviously strategy proof. That's roughly speaking what I said in the sense that Sheng Wu will make precise. It's weekly group strategy proof, which means that if there's no transfers allowed between the participants, there's no joint deviation that any group of bidders can adopt that's strictly profitable for all of them.
00:29:25.538 - 00:29:56.774, Speaker A: So unless the bidders collude and make side payments, there's no group deviation that's strictly profitable for all the participants. Do you think they will collude? Oh, yeah. Well, the. So we. So in practice. Boy, the time is really ticking on me here. Can I take that offline? Because there's all sorts of other issues that have to do with channel sharing technologies.
00:29:56.774 - 00:30:41.624, Speaker A: Bidders who go off air might choose to share a channel, then they have to be able to talk to each other. But once they can talk to each other, how do you stop them from talking about the bids in the auction? So these things are tricky, and we actually did a lot of work on that. That's part of the economics that I won't talk about today. Algorithmically, this is a greedy rejection algorithm, which is to say that as prices go down, what's happening is that bids are being rejected. These are people who are not going to be paid. They're moving onto the plane rather than so what's happening is that I am greedily rejecting stations. And that's important from, it's not algorithmically important, but it's important from the standpoint of analyzing incentives.
00:30:41.624 - 00:31:30.074, Speaker A: Okay. To run quickly because time is really running off on me, call a set of bids independent if it's possible to find seats or tv channels for the rejected bidders. In the airline example, the collection of independent sets that I just showed you is a matroid. Consequently, this greedy rejections algorithm does implement an efficient outcome. And consequently, because the Vickrey auction is the only strategy proof auction that implements the efficient outcome, it follows that the prices that are coming out of this are Vickrey prices. I'm going to jump over. There's some closely related work in computer science and economics.
00:31:30.074 - 00:32:03.830, Speaker A: These guys, the overbooking problem, it's the bids that the auction rejects, not the ones that accepts, that are processed greedily. That's a distinction of this from the previous work. But this previous work is closely related, and I won't say more about it given the time. Ok, the auction algorithm needs to perform well. I have only ten minutes left, so let's do a little bit of this. So, from airlines to the FCC. So our auction is not exactly the same as what I explained to you.
00:32:03.830 - 00:32:39.258, Speaker A: Here are the main differences. First of all, the price that's offered to a bidder in any round is not the same for all bidders. It's not just the clock price. Rather, it's the clock price multiplied by some bidder specific constant. And that bidder specific constant depends on the population coverage that the bidder has and the number of stations with which it interferes. So we are trying to offer higher prices to pull out stations that cause a lot of interference. There's a knapsack like character, we think to part of the problem, and we want to get rid of the stations that take up a lot of space, so to speak.
00:32:39.258 - 00:33:20.676, Speaker A: And we don't want to overpay small stations. We think we can get small stations to exit for lower prices. So we take into account the population of the station in making the offers, if you like. That's a price discrimination trick that's built into the design. That's probably the wrong language to use, but we are offering prices that are dependent on population. The thing I want to talk to you about, I guess the technical piece I want to talk to you about is approximate Matrid. So what I've learned from you guys when I hear about algorithms, is if you don't have one structure, let's try another structure.
00:33:20.676 - 00:34:18.622, Speaker A: Let's move away from gross substitutes to submodularity to something else, where you go from one structure to the other. And, you know, as an economist, the way economists tend to think about this is a little different. And I wanted to see if I could formalize that. I wanted to think that this idea, you know, it's not substitutes exactly. It's not a metroid, exactly, but maybe it's close to being a matriid in some sense. Is there a metric that tells me how close this thing is to being a matrix that tells me how well a greedy algorithm would perform? So that's the kind of way I wanted to approach the problem, because I don't want to say as soon as you take one constraint that kills the matride structure, that a greedy algorithm won't perform well. So, given a collection of independent set c, the goal is to find a larger collection, which I'll call the outer bound mo for outer, and a smaller collection, mi, which is the inner bound with mi in c in mo.
00:34:18.622 - 00:35:20.158, Speaker A: And then to build an auction that's equivalent to running a greedy algorithm on Mi, find the optimum for that overly constrained problem, and then relax the constraints to continue to fill c. Now, if Mi and Mo are close to each other, then they're close to c. I know that the greedy algorithm gets me an exact optimum on mi, that the greedy algorithm gets me an exact optimum on mo, that the value of mi and mo are close, and therefore I would be getting an approximate optimum for c. And if I could meteorize the distance between mi and mo, I would be telling you something about how well the greedy algorithm could perform. So, that's the general idea. And with only a few minutes, here's a, here are some hierarchy based matrides, and the reason that I'm using them. So I'll say that a collection of, so I have a ground set, g, like if you like the set of tv stations or the set of passengers, and I have subsets of that.
00:35:20.158 - 00:36:22.306, Speaker A: And that set forms a hierarchy. If for any two elements, any two sets in the collection, either one's a subset of the other, or they're disjoint. So that was the case in the first class, business class coach example that we looked at a moment ago. I'm going to say, given some notation, given this hierarchy, and given any function from the hierarchy to the natural numbers, including zero, I'm going to say that. Mfh, so this is going to be my matrite approximation. Using this function, h in this boundary, this function f, and this collection h is the collection of sets, sets s such that the size of the intersection, the number of elements in the intersection of s with b is less than or equal to f of b for all b in the hierarchy. So that's a hierarchy which is defined by a bunch of inequality bounds.
00:36:22.306 - 00:37:14.202, Speaker A: This is a a set that's defined by a bunch of inequality bounds. And the theorem is for this collection of sets mfh is a matride for all functions f if and only if this collection h is a hierarchy. Okay, so this is a. So the reason I'm using hierarchies is that when you impose bounds in this way, this is the if you impose bounds in this way, and you don't know what the bounds are going to be in advance, you want to determine the set f. You need the collection h to be a hierarchy. Ok, so given a family of independent sets and a hierarchy, I'm going to define a bounding function this way. I'm going to let b of s be the maximum for all t in my collection of s intersect t.
00:37:14.202 - 00:38:01.758, Speaker A: So by construction c is in m of h and b. So I've taken this bound so that it's just big enough to not constrain anything that's actually in the real constraint set. And then I'm going to. So that's for my outer bounding set. That's going to give me my outer bound, and then I'm going to define b rho of s to be. I'm going to take rho times this outer bound, and where rho is enough that if I shrink the outer bound enough, I get an inner bound on C, and I'm going to use rho to measure how close I am. If rho is one, then the original set is a hierarchy and therefore is a matrite, and I'm done.
00:38:01.758 - 00:38:53.072, Speaker A: And if rho is zero, I mean, some row will work. Zero will always work here, because if, if I don't impose any constraints, I'm fine. So I'll always get an inner bound if I don't take any elements at all. So given these values for each item, you can then apply the standard greedy algorithm to this inner approximation. Relax, and continue the greedy algorithm. And what you'll get is that this algorithm obtains at least a one minus rho star fraction of the maximum value of the problem with these constraints, which is the outer bound constraints, and consequently with the actual constraints. So optimizing just on the inner bound gives me this fraction, one minus rho of what I get if I optimized on the outer bound.
00:38:53.072 - 00:39:45.334, Speaker A: And since the actual constraints are between the inner and outer bound, I must be getting at least one minus rho of of the actual constraints as well. Okay, and the point is then that there is a deferred acceptance. There is a descending auction where I descend prices separately to each station where I do it in that way so that I'm greedily selecting the stations in Mi and then continuing to reduce prices to continue to apply the constraints in C. And so there is a deferred acceptance auction, a descending price auction that implements this. And it's obviously strategy proof in this sense that Sheng Wu is going to define for you a little later. Okay? And I don't really have time. You can also mix matrides.
00:39:45.334 - 00:40:37.574, Speaker A: What I really want to be able to do, this is all research in progress, is mix matrides and knapsacks in greedy algorithm this is a not a particularly good description of what goes on in the FCC problem, but it's my first attempt to mix matriid and knapsack constraints. So imagine that the ground set is partitioned into a collection of items g one through GK, and that I have associated matriid constraints within each one of these ground sets. And I have sizes, if you will. I probably should have used s for sizes, but WK is the size of a station in ground set k. And suppose I have this additional knapsack like constraint. So the idea is that in the FCC auction, some stations cause a lot of interference. They interfere with a lot of other stations.
00:40:37.574 - 00:41:24.304, Speaker A: Some stations cause very little interference. Let's imagine that that's a characteristic of the area that the station's in, that stations in Detroit or stations in Chicago. As I say, this isn't necessarily a good description of the real FCC problem. But suppose that that's a characteristic of the stations in the area. And suppose that I fail to be a matrite only because of these other constraints. If there's not too much interference that I can find a coloring, then I can use the kind of greedy algorithm that's used in the knapsack problem, where you look at value per size respecting both the knapsack and the matride constraints. And suppose that you stop this wastefully the first time that the knapsack constraint causes a rejection.
00:41:24.304 - 00:42:15.310, Speaker A: If the remaining space in the knapsack at termination is sigma, then the algorithm performance is at least one minus sigma over k. It's the same bound that you get from any knapsack problem. But instead of the items all being individual, I have, for each item, I have another group of matriid constraints on them. So this, moreover, there is a descending clock auction that implements this algorithm. So I can run a clock auction that achieves good efficiency and respects simultaneously a knapsack type constraint and matroid type constraints. So the object is to try to explain good performance in a certain class of applications. As why did matriarch constraints make sense? Well, remember we had these in the airline overbooking.
00:42:15.310 - 00:42:52.628, Speaker A: We had first class, business class, coach. In the radio spectrum allocation problem, we have Chicago, which is a clique. All those things interfere with one another. I can have a constraint that if I have 15 channels available, I can't have more than 15 stations in Chicago. I have a lot of constraints like that. And to the extent that those are the most important constraints on the problem, I can hope to, that some kind of greedy algorithm in this class will perform well, taking those constraints into account. So I'm almost out of time.
00:42:52.628 - 00:43:06.062, Speaker A: So I guess I'll stop here and take questions. Sergio, just before we went to the.
00:43:06.078 - 00:43:15.014, Speaker B: Matron, you said something on the fact that the clocks or the prices are running differently from different stations.
00:43:15.174 - 00:43:16.318, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:43:16.486 - 00:43:49.812, Speaker B: Now I can understand that in those different. So there is a fairness issue here that perhaps. Let me go to court. Challenge what you are doing now. They cannot challenge if those are different markets. But two stations that are in exactly the same area, one is in 27 and one is in 35, and 35 is much more problematic because of the other, of the other constraints. Why should they be paid 1000 when the other in 27 is paid 500, where they are making exactly the same profit? They have the same coverage.
00:43:49.812 - 00:43:53.252, Speaker B: It just, you know, they will allocate the different members.
00:43:53.348 - 00:44:36.098, Speaker A: So your intuition about what people will challenge is completely wrong. That's not, nobody challenges that part. Everybody understands that what the FCC needs to do is to eliminate stations that are causing interference, that keep it from clearing as much spectrum as they like. The challenges that came up were the other kind where people said, gee, you know, you need me just as badly as you need him. How come you're paying me less just because I serve a smaller population? You know, it's. So the challenges are actually very different than the one you mentioned. The FCC is a governmental entity, and it has a, if you read in the report in order, it takes all the comments into account.
00:44:36.098 - 00:45:01.914, Speaker A: There are people that challenge it, and there are other people that say, well, you know, other tv stations that say population coverage is one of the main things we use in figuring out our valuation. So that seems appropriate. And the FCC says, we've looked at comments from both sides and we've decided to keep the rule that we proposed. So. Yep, that's what the report in order says. Okay, so just one addition to that.
00:45:01.954 - 00:45:34.134, Speaker C: Actually, it is not true that two stations who are identical but just happen to be on different channels, they will be offered different prices because we really can be retuned. So the initial channel really doesn't matter to us. And so if you have two stations that are exactly identical, have exactly the same coverage and exactly the same interference constraints in any possible channel where they might be assigned, then they would be offered exactly the same prices up for this one decrement because of the random processing to break the ties.
00:45:34.294 - 00:45:57.644, Speaker A: So Ilya heard a different question than I heard. So just to reconcile these two things, it's not that they're on a different channel. I heard you saying they had different population coverages. Same population coverage. Oh, then it doesn't matter what channel they're on because we can move them into different seats. No, no, no. It said the number of interstations with which.
00:45:57.644 - 00:46:22.698, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's not determined based on the channel that you're on. That's determined based on the channels you could be on. Because we're going to. We're reassigning. Everybody's getting new channels. We have to take. Everybody who's, let's say if we clears channel 31 to 51, everybody who's on a channel above channel 31 will be moved to and stays on the air will be moved to a channel below channel 31.
00:46:22.698 - 00:46:45.234, Speaker A: And to make room for them, we may have to move some other people around too. You don't have a right to the channel you're on. You only have a right to a broadcast channel in the UHF band. No, when you think population, the actual number of viewers that they have over the area. No. The population that's covered in their service area and the service area of all stations in Detroit is not the same. No.
00:46:45.234 - 00:47:10.394, Speaker A: You know, in Chicago the stations are all broadcasting from the top of the Willis tower. And if they tune their antennas in the same direction, they'd have the same coverage. But you could be in a different location. The antennas are partly directional. They did that because at the time they were setting up, they didn't want to cause interference with somebody else, so they tuned their station in a certain way. So they start with. They can start with different population coverages.
00:47:10.394 - 00:47:33.294, Speaker A: And that's already determined now or only when the auction starts or after the. No, we know it now. They have licenses now to a better location, which would give them more. No, no, no. They have a license now that tells them what area they're intended to cover without interference broadcast at a certain power without interference in a certain area. That's all fixed. Yeah.
00:47:33.294 - 00:48:21.424, Speaker A: Isn't there a problem if I own multiple seats? Yes, absolutely right. So we designed this auction with the small broadcasters in mind. If you own multiple seats in the same area, that is in, in the overbooking example, if you own multiple first class seats or multiple coach seats or multiple business class seats. In other words, if you own multiple television stations in the same city, then you do have some market power, and it's not strategy proof. And we were designing with the small broadcasters in mind to make it easy for them. It turns out that most of the big broadcasters own only one station in each city. But there are some places where this is a problem and market power is a problem for us in those places.
00:48:21.464 - 00:48:42.728, Speaker C: Yes, but you cannot own more than two stations in each market now by the FCC rules. Also, if you own two, you may not necessarily consider selling both of them. You might want just to sell one and not sell the other. So the cases where you want to excise market power, where the choice is to sell two versus to sell one, they might happen, but then from the north vehicle.
00:48:42.816 - 00:48:58.044, Speaker A: So what? You lose. I would have sold two, but I'm going to draw one of them back in time to get more from the other one. Yeah, that's the risk. Yes. All right. Well, thank you, everybody.
